It could be an entire metropolitan area, as is indeed the case in the Melbourne metropolitan area right now. <br></p> <p>Or even more broadly, if the chief medical officer was of the view that a hot spot encompassed an entire state jurisdiction. So the commonwealth’s decision to provide that support will be based on the medical advice received by the chief medical officer of the commonwealth, which is only reasonable, given that the commonwealth has no part in the decisions made by state governments when they are coming to their view as to how they might impose their restrictions.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-06-03T03:18:55.735Z\">at 4.18am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-60b848248f08b9889b367406\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-03T03:13:40.019Z\">4.13am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Scott Morrison press conference</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There is a bit of mumble as <strong>Scott Morrison</strong> asks <strong>Josh Frydenberg </strong>for some papers, and then we get into it.</p> <p>Suddenly, the virus Morrison described as ‘insidious’ yesterday, is now something we don’t have to fear.</p> <p>Just take a big dose of that resilience and we’ll be fine.</p> <p><strong>Morrison</strong>:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> We don’t have to fear this virus.

In the resources sector, you will demonstrate, as you already are, how Australia will be successful in the new energy economy in adapting in new technologies, in new fuels, in new methods, in new partnerships, in new supply chains. <br></p> <p>You will demonstrate, in fact, the resources sector, in my view, will be the pin-up industry in this country for how Australia will be not just making commitments as many will want to do, but importantly are meeting those commitments and beating those commitments. Australia has already reduced emissions by over 20% on 2005 levels. <br></p> <p>Over 20%. That’s a fact. That is something that you have helped achieve. <br></p> <p>And the commitments that we’ve made out to 2030, you will help us meet. <br></p> <p>And more than help us meet it, I think you will showcase how Australia is beating them. <br></p> <p>And so the very industry that many have sought to use to try and talk Australia down when it comes to these issues, is the very industry that will prove Australia is a leader when it comes to new energy, that Australia is a leader in job generation and job creation. <br></p> <p>The Australian way, which says we can make these commitments and not forsake our heavy industries, not forsake our mining industries*. And most importantly, not forsake the people of regional Australia, who others would seek to have us ignore for the sake of pursuing those commitments. We believe both can be achieved and will be achieved, because I have great confidence in the skills and capacity of the resources sector to achieve that. <br></p> <p>We want to produce amongst the cheapest green hydrogen** in the world by 2030 and 2050.</p> </blockquote> <p>*This is not what the largest economies in the world are saying, including those countries Australia will be speaking to at the G7</p> <p>**Hydrogen is only green when it comes from renewable sources.

Given that you know, that is the only thing that will actually bring the nation out of the pandemic. There is a lot about what has happened. Morrison says he hasn’t been asked by Victoria for additional vaccines. The payment only kicks in after seven days (so good luck for that first week, I guess) and only where the commonwealth has declared a hotspot. Scott Morrison: I see nothing wrong with there being the Commonwealth where we are making the payments. I have no part in the decisions made by state governments and they can choose to do as they remind me regularly what they like to do, when they like to do and for how long they like to do it. It comes to federal taxpayers money in place, we will be relying on the medical advice of the Chief Medical Officer. For comparison, the disaster relief payment (for floods, fire, etc) is $1000 with an extra $400 for each dependent. Drought relief is offered at $3000 as a one off payment. This is $500, with a lot of strings – if you work more than 20 hours a week. Under 20 hours, and it is $325. And that’s if you haven’t withdrawn $10,000 from your super and have that sitting in your savings somewhere. Oh – and the states haven’t agreed to it, in terms of how it will be paid, but the federal government wants 50/50. All of that is to be worked out tomorrow at national cabinet. Scott Morrison does not sound very happy at all as he delivers this announcement. He can’t even manage the necessary emoting for the line: Resilience, strength, character, determination. That is what beats a virus, never fear. You know what actually beats a virus though? Vaccines. Resilience, strength, character and determination doesn’t really cut it when you’re dealing with a virus. You actually just need antibodies. So there are quite a lot of strings attached to this payment, and there is no agreement over who is paying for what as yet. Scott Morrison then says what Victorians want: Victorians just want to know that they are getting help next week. That is what matters and they will be able to do this from Tuesday in making an application online with Services Australia and there will also be a number they can contact and there will be further information provided about that. They want to know they will get that support and if you meet the criteria you will get that support next week and you will get that payment next week. It will be provided into your bank account, as all of these payments ordinarily are. So who pays for it? Morrison: Who is paying for it and how that is being worked out? There are two options and I will be discussing these with national cabinet tomorrow. Costs should be shared. Presently the Victorian government is doing that directly and 100% with the business support they are providing. What I put to the acting premier last night was that we should split 50-50 both payments. Go 50-50 on household and 50-50 on business. Alternatively, the states can agree that in these will always provide the household support. Either way, we will work it out and in national cabinet tomorrow we will have a good discussion about it. What matters is that businesses get the support they need and households get the support they need and the politicians don’t need to have a discussion in public about how that is going to get done. They just need to know it is going to get done, going to get that support and we just need to get on with it to ensure they have the confidence about moving forward into the next week. The “temporary Covid disaster payment” will be made on a week by week basis. It will be distributed through the existing natural disaster payment arrangements. Here is how Scott Morrison explains it: That will be a payment of $500 for those who would ordinarily work more than 20 hours in a week and $325 for those who would work less than 20 hours a week. It will be available to a person or Australian resident, these are class permitted to work in Australia. The person is at least 17 years old. The period occurs from the date of activation for an area which has been locked down for more than seven days. I should stress, this is a similar arrangement that exists in New Zealand where their payments for this type of support kick in after seven days, not before. The person resides or works in the area defined as a commonwealth determined hotspot. The person was immediately prior to the state health and commonwealth determined hotspot engaged in paid employment and is unable to attend work and therefore unable to earn an income as a result of state health restrictions. You’ll be aware that we already have a pandemic leave payment for people who are required to isolate for a 14 day period. And they could be because they are a close contact, testing or any other number of reasons determined by the state government. The person self declares that they would normally have worked in the relevant period. The person self declares a loss of income for the relevant period. The person will not be required to use annual leave but must have sufficient, must have insufficient other appropriate leave entitlements, including special pandemic sick leave, and have exhausted those entitlements. So you don’t have to get into your annual leave but if your employer is already providing your lease for these types of purposes than it is reasonable that people would use those in these circumstances. The person self declares that they have liquid assets of less than $10,000. You can’t get it if you are receiving jobseeker or other income support. We now get to the actual announcement. Scott Morrison: We will be putting in place a national framework for circumstances where there are lockdowns imposed by state, public or health orders in areas that are defined as a commonwealth hot spot by the chief medical officer. Those arrangements will provide support for periods of time where the lockdown has been greater than seven days. So the first seven days, they are matters entirely for state and territory governments, as they wish to provide support. If a lockdown, as a result of a state public health order, continues in an area that is also defined by the chief officer of the commonwealth, then we will be providing support for payments for those affected and those affected areas. Now that could be a particular suburb, defined by postcodes. It could be an entire metropolitan area, as is indeed the case in the Melbourne metropolitan area right now. Or even more broadly, if the chief medical officer was of the view that a hot spot encompassed an entire state jurisdiction. So the commonwealth’s decision to provide that support will be based on the medical advice received by the chief medical officer of the commonwealth, which is only reasonable, given that the commonwealth has no part in the decisions made by state governments when they are coming to their view as to how they might impose their restrictions. There is a bit of mumble as Scott Morrison asks Josh Frydenberg for some papers, and then we get into it. Suddenly, the virus Morrison described as ‘insidious’ yesterday, is now something we don’t have to fear. Just take a big dose of that resilience and we’ll be fine. Morrison: We don’t have to fear this virus. We haven’t got to where we are til now by fearing this virus. The success Australia has had compared to 70 other countries around the world, both from a health perspective and from an economic perspective has been achieved because we worked together. Australians have been resilient, they’ve gone about, this been things that have been asked of them time and again that can be very demanding and come at great personal cost, and they haven’t done it out of fear, they’ve done it out of determination and resilience and strength and their good character. And that’s what we as a government continue to rely on and draw upon as we continue to make our way, our Australian way, through this Covid-19 pandemic, which as we know, continues to rage and it continues to seek out opportunities here in Australia to requite it does. But it is not something we feel, it is something we fight. Into something we address and we do it safely, effectively, collaboratively and we do it together and that is why we have had so much success to date. But the challenges keep coming, as we have seen and Victoria, as we saw earlier this year, whether it was in the Northern Beaches of Sydney or south-western Sydney, up in Brisbane, over in Perth, and now again here in Victoria, and we know that Victoria, more than anywhere, has suffered greater than any other part of the country. That is a simple fact. And they are going through that even again now. Australia has chipped in $50m to the global Covax fund – which is providing vaccine doses to developing nations. Save the Children’s Sarah Carter says there is more to be done though: There is an urgent need to ensure vaccination coverage is truly global because it is the only way to help bring an end to this pandemic. Vaccines are vital, not just to save lives but also to help make societies safe again for children. Right now, millions of children are still out of school, and run the risk of being forced to work or marry, as schools can’t open because of the pandemic. It’s simply not acceptable that the world’s poorest countries have received just 1.3% of the world’s vaccines. This crisis won’t be over for anyone until it’s over for everyone, including children. That follows activists in America calling for Australia to support a patent waiver for Covid vaccines, to improve access. Victoria’s press conference ends – we are just waiting for Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg now. Professor Allen Cheng is asked whether Victoria is just unlucky, or whether there are other factors that mean outbreaks spread further than in other states, and says: I think it is really difficult to know. We thankfully don’t have a huge sample size to say what might be different or not. I think there’s always an element of luck in this. As I said before, if you have a person in the community with infection, it depends very much on who they are. And we certainly know that 80% of people with Covid don’t transmit to anyone. 20% of them transmit at least to someone and a very small number transmit to a lot of people. So there is an element of luck to it. I think it’s always difficult to know to what extent things like the climate and these sorts of things that are outside our control have – like India and Singapore and any other countries that have different climates to Australia. So I’m not sure if that is a huge factor in this. Labor’s Penny Wong is probing the pre-flight testing regime from India repatriation flights, after more than 70 of the 150 people booked on the first flight after the travel ban was lifted were unable to travel. Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade first assistant secretary, Lynette Wood, told estimates the pre-flight testing regime is Qantas’s responsibility. The minister, Marise Payne, adds an Ausmat team with an Australian doctor was sent to India to oversee it. But that doctor only arrived on 17 May, two days after the first flight. Wong asks if that’s because the first flight went so wrong – and claims that Wood nodded but it won’t be picked up by Hansard. Payne said the doctor went on advice from the chief medical officer. Wong is now probing whether Dfat knew that Qantas’s provider of pre-flight testing had subcontracted to a lab that had its accreditation revoked. Wood said the department became aware of this from media reports. Dfat was aware of the 70 passengers who were unable to fly before the media – so that’s something! Wood said the “large number” of positives caught their attention, and that caused them to ask the CMO, who advised them to send a public health officer to check the system was “as robust as possible”. Wood said “as a consequence of the first flight Qantas decided to change the laboratory it was using”. Dfat is not able to say how many of the 70 have made it back to Australia, they’ve taken it on notice. Dipping out of the Victorian press conference now – The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the foreign minister, Marise Payne, were not consulted about using the Biosecurity Act to pause travel from India to prevent escalating Covid-19 positive cases in quarantine. Labor’s Penny Wong asked if the department was aware the government was considering the use of Biosecurity Act powers by the health minister, Greg Hunt. Dfat secretary, Frances Adamson, said: “No I was not aware.” Payne qualifies the answer by noting that the decision to pause arrivals into Australia was a “decision made at cabinet level”, made through “normal processes”, and she was present. Wong summarises that while the minister was aware of the intention to implement a pause, she was not aware the Biosecurity Act would be used. This is relevant because the Act contained the penalties of $66,000 fines or five years in prison, which became one of the most controversial aspects of the ban. Payne says to the best of her recollection Hunt did not tell her that, Dfat was told, who advised her office, which then advised her on 30 April. Payne: “The determination of the use of Biosecurity Act has from time to time been discussed at cabinet level.” Wong: “Not for this purpose.” Wong asked why the department and minister were “ridiculously out of the loop”, which Payne rejects. The ABC is reporting a two-year-old child who was in hotel quarantine after arriving from an international flight has been taken to hospital “quite unwell” with Covid. You have to check-in in Melbourne now, even if you are somewhere for less than 15 minutes (so takeaways). James Merlino: What we have seen with this more infectious and therefore quicker variant, you get a number of cases where it is quite a quick transmission or it is a transmission where the individuals don’t actually meet within that environment. So therefore the advice from public health is that we need to do away with that 15 minute period where it’s not a requirement to check-in. So if you are grabbing your takeaway coffee and you are standing for a few minutes as the barrister is brewing your coffee, you need to check-in. Asked about Victorian MPs who are campaigning against Victoria receiving any federal support, James Merlino says: I think that is disgraceful and if you talk to any Victorian business, any Victorian worker who are so disadvantaged, devastated by the lockdown that we must enter into, they would be appalled that anyone, anyone would be advocating to the federal government to ignore the needs of Victorian workers. James Merlino doesn’t criticise federal government MPs directly, but he doesn’t not criticise them either: The point I want to make here is that this is not a choice. We don’t choose to go into lockdown. There is no choice. You either run this variant to ground as we’ve heard, it is a responsibility of everyone in this media conference and communicating it to the people of Victoria, Professor Cheng today has said that it is 50% more infectious, this variant, than what we saw in 2020. It’s what Professor Sutton has said. That’s the advice from our public health team. So when we get advice from public health experts that you must go into lockdown and have a series of restrictions in order to run this to ground and ensure it doesn’t escape and become uncontrollable, that is not a choice for government, it’s not a choice for Victorians. Would Victorians want to see government just ignoring the advice from public health and saying actually we won’t go into lockdown, we won’t have restrictions because it’s all a bit too hard? That is not a choice available to us. We’ve got a responsibility to make our community safe and to make sure that people don’t get sick and people don’t die. That is our responsibility and we won’t walk away from that and it’s frankly insulting for anyone to suggest that any state or territory would choose to enter into a lockdown period to combat this virus. (Sorry for the mistaken spelling of “Alan” in Professor Allen Cheng’s name in previous posts – I have been fighting with the autocorrect all morning and missed those ones). Asked if he spoke about an alternative purpose built quarantine facility during his phone call with Scott Morrison, James Merlino says yes, but it was brief: It is something we are waiting for, in terms of a definitive answer from the federal government ... The whole purpose of our proposal for an alternative quarantine facility, not just in Victoria but elsewhere, the whole purpose of an alternative quarantine, a Howard Springs-like facility, is that we make our quarantine system safer. The whole purpose is to ensure that we lower the risk in hotel quarantine. It would be completely and utterly unacceptable to all Victorians if we have a model that does not lower risk in hotel quarantine. Hotels are built for tourists. We need a purpose-built facility for our highest risk travellers. Whether it is from where they come from or who they are, we need a system where our highest risk individuals go to a facility that is purpose-built. That is a line that we will not cross. We will not accept a model that doesn’t lower risk in hotel quarantine and has an indefinite capacity increase in our hotel quarantine system. This is all about making our state and our nation safer. So that is the key thing, the key thing in terms of the negotiations and the discussions around state and federal officials, in terms of my discussions with the prime minister and others. We need to lower the risk in hotel quarantine. We need to have the highest risk individuals going to a purpose-built facility. Scott Morrison will hold his press conference at 12.45 James Merlino: I want to take you through some statistics. I said yesterday that only 2% of our population is fully vaccinated. Only 2%. Only two out of 10 people have received their first vaccine. There are countries around the world where they have got fully vaccinated populations well over 50%. In England, they are almost a 50%. In the United States, they are at something like 52%. In Israel it is 57%. There are countries around the world that are easing restrictions and getting on top of the pandemic because they have rolled out the vaccine program. We are at 2%. Nationally, we have been woefully, painfully slow. So when we get advice from public health that we need a lockdown it is a lockdown in an environment where only 2% of our population is fully vaccinated. James Merlino: There are a lot of things we are waiting for when it comes to the Morrison government. We are waiting for a definitive decision on alternative quarantine. We are waiting on whether they are going to support Victorian workers or not. We are waiting on more supply of the vaccine. There are a lot of things we are waiting for and the point I would make is the only way, the only way out of this pandemic is the successful rollout of the vaccine. The vaccine is our enemy ... sorry, I will start again. Here we go, that will run tonight. The virus, the virus is our enemy and the virus doesn’t sleep. The virus mutates, the virus thinks that this is a race. James Merlino says he had construction conversations with Scott Morrison overnight about financial support for Victoria, but he will not pre-empt any announcement from the federal government. James Merlino on whether the lockdown could end earlier: As the professor [Cheng] said today and Brett Sutton said yesterday, it is a day by day analysis about how we’re tracking and if we can do things earlier we will, but the advice from public health has been we need a further seven days in Melbourne to chase this down to the end, to follow this outbreak because we cannot afford to let this outbreak loose in Victoria and beyond our state borders. We have got to drive this to ground and that is why the advice of public health is we need those seven days. Is James Merlino worried about Melbourne residents heading to regional Victoria tonight, to avoid another week of lockdown? I’m not too worried, to be honest. The settings that we have in place, whether it is the 10 kilometre limit that will apply for people living in Melbourne, the additional patrols that Victoria police have, the requirement on regional businesses to ensure that people and patrons coming into their shops are living in regional Victoria or have a reason to be in regional Victoria. I think for all those reasons I am not expecting too much there. It is still not clear which member of the family who travelled from NSW’s south coast back home to Melbourne had Covid first. NSW has extended its exposure sites as a precaution, but Cheng says authorities are still trying to work it out. Was it reasonable to compare the infectiousness of this strain to the measles? Allen Cheng: R-0 is the reproductive number when there is no controls in place, so we think for the virus that we had last year, it is probably about 2.5, that figure for the UK variants, the Alpha strain is probably about 3.75 and for the Delta strain which is not the one that we have here, it is probably about in the order of five, but that’s when you don’t have anything, any controls over the virus. Even before all of this, despite, we didn’t have lockdown, people were still behaving in a way that they weren’t interacting as much with each other and taking care, and so that probably was suppressing the virus to some extent but it was still able to grow, so they are effective, but the effective reproductive number in that situation was about 2.5. And then as we’ve tightened up even just before the lockdown, we think that the R effective was 1.1 to 1.3. We think now with everything we’re doing now, probably it is below one and the national modelling expert estimates at about 0.69. There is a range of uncertainty about that but that is lower than one and it is encouraging to say that, it won’t spread widely but variously [changes] with contact tracing. Professor Allen Cheng: It is more infectious, in the sense that more people get infected for every case, so I think that is accurate to say that. The other thing I think that there may be some confusion over is, we have talked about the serial interval, so this is the time between when the first person gets sick to the time that the next person they get it to get. That time is actually shorter when it’s good contact tracing, because people are not transmitting on the 10th day of their illness, we cut of the transmissibility so that development is shorter. So that as a sign of good contact tracing and the fact that we can pick up transmission through relatively short interactions. Asked about the debate over the Kappa strain and how contagious it is compared to other strains (some of the language around it has been a bit loose) Allen Cheng says: There are two parameters there. It is not really controversial to say that these variants have been shown to be more infectious. The way that is looked at is is it enclosed areas - what is the attack rate in households? What proportion of people get infected? For the variance, including the [Kappa] variant we are dealing with at the moment, it has shown to be higher than the strain we were dealing with last year. The other thing we have seen is that people – like the case that we had today where we linked it [to a shopping centre] there are certainly people that have been strangers to each other and caught the infection from each other and we know that they are not, you know, shows us that this is a very infectious virus. It is possible that from our contact tracing that we are taking travel histories from everyone and that we are picking up some of these cases that way, so that reflects contact tracing as well. Asked about reports of a shortage of the Pfizer vaccine in Victoria, professor Allen Cheng says: We are still vaccinating at the moment. In times of forward bookings, there is a shortage, but I am not sure exactly when that supply will become available. We are trying to do the best we can with the supply we have. ...We would always welcome any state that wanted to give their vaccine to us, but that is a national matter. ...There is a small stockpile and we are using those at the moment. I could not give you the exact figures, but clearly there has been a surge in demand for vaccines and there is not the supply to be able to meet that at the moment. Allen Cheng says he thinks over the last few weeks, authorities have tested about 5% of all Victorians. Is there a possibility Melbourne could come out of the lockdown earlier? Professor Allen Cheng: We are reviewing this every day. Today is not that day, but we are keeping a close eye on things and it really depends on, particularly, the number of cases that you have community exposure and with the lockdown and contact tracing and so on that number should decrease. One thing we have been able to do - as of this morning, we had linked one of those mystery cases to another case, so there are now three unlinked cases. That is the case in Whittlesea, the case in Maidstone, the family reported yesterday - whichever the first case was there - there was one other case that lives in the South Melbourne area, and we now, as of this morning, have managed to link that person to another case from an exposure site. ...I do not have full details but I understand they were at a shopping centre at the same time and the same place. So, in case you missed it, regional Victoria will come out of lockdown at midnight. Professor Allen Cheng is at this press conference. He goes through the cases: One is a child of a previously identified case in Whittlesea. One is a staff member from a port Melbourne workplace. As the facility announced yesterday, one person is in their 90s who is a resident at Arcare Maidstone. That brings the number of cases that are linked to that facility to five - four within the facility. Our thoughts are with the Arcare community. We have great faith in the Arcare management and the Western public health unit to help the facility manage this outbreak and protect residents and staff. Just breaking in for a moment – Scott Morrison will hold a press conference very soon. So we can expect some sort of announcement on support for Victoria soon. James Merlino: I want to thank all Victorians for three things in particular: First, going out and getting tested. It was a record date for tests yesterday. Over 57,000 people received a test that is an incredible effort and I want to thank all Victorians. Second, for getting vaccinated. It was a record day for vaccinations with over 23,000 administered at state sites. Third, doing the right thing over the last seven days and for doing the right thing over the next seven days. We do not do this because we want to. We do not do this because it is a choice. We do this because we have to. James Merlino has confirmed three new cases for Victoria – all are primary contacts of confirmed cases. The change in restrictions for Greater Melbourne will come in at midnight - but lockdown remains. Regional Victoria will come out of lockdown. Social distancing restrictions will remain, but people can once again come out of their homes. We are still waiting to find out what support the federal government plans to offer Victoria, but it is clear the Victorian government isn’t too pleased with how discussions have been going. Throughout the process, Victoria has maintained income support is the job of the federal government. So disaster relief payments (where the commonwealth and states go 50/50) is not exactly what the Victorian government is calling for. Victoria has announced $459m in support for business and industry so far this lockdown ($250m in an original announcement and $209m yesterday) and now wants the federal government to stump up the income support. We know that is not something the federal government wants to do - it’s heading towards disaster relief, if anything, so this has some way to play out. We’re at the stage of equating particular areas with an entire state. The issue isn’t who didn’t get it. It’s who needs it. Again, we are 18 months into a pandemic, with lockdowns so expected they form a major part of the federal budget assumptions, and no plan of when to enact support when those lockdowns happen. The reason Josh Frydenberg and the government keep adding ‘per capita’ on when they are talking about support Victoria received during the height of the pandemic is because, in raw figures, NSW received more. That’s fine - everyone deserves a slice of the pie, and we are a federation, we’re all supposed to help each other out. But things happen. Disasters happen. No one wants a lockdown. It doesn’t bring the Victorian government any kudos to lockdown an already traumatised population. People need to be able to live, and all this political bunfight is doing is increasing anxiety about how exactly they are going to do that. The Victorian presser will be held at 11.40 today. We’ll find out whether regional Victoria will be able to ease out of restrictions, as planned. Activists in the US have held a vigil in California, remembering those who have died from Covid – and calling on the Australian government to support “policies needed to increase global access to vaccines and treatments”. Elias Visontay may be on leave – but he is every vigilant and sent me through this: The vigil came just days before a major international meeting where governments will discuss waiving intellectual property rights to enable more Covid vaccine, diagnostic and treatment production. The government of Australia is one of the last holdouts to not come out in full support of the waiver. “Ending a global pandemic requires global solutions. While Californians increasingly have widespread access to COVID vaccination, huge numbers of people around the world aren’t expected to have access to a vaccine for years unless global production is dramatically increased,” said Will Jamil Wiltschko of the California Trade Justice Coalition. “We’re calling on the government of Australia to stand with the more than one hundred countries around the world in supporting the intellectual property waiver that’s needed for COVID vaccines and treatments to be produced in as many places as possible as quickly as possible.” The United States, Russia and China recently announced their support for a TRIPS waiver for COVID vaccines, joining over 100 other nations who had earlier backed the concept. Australia is increasingly isolated as one of the only countries that has not come out in favour of the waiver. The Greens senator Janet Rice has been questioning the foreign minister, Marise Payne, about why Australia hasn’t imposed more sanctions on Myanmar’s military regime. Payne replies that it is still the Australian government’s position that sanctions would be counter-productive although the position is constantly under review. Asked about 397 civil society groups that have called for Australia to impose sanctions, Payne said Australia “certainly respects the perspective those organisations bring” but Australia “must make our decisions on a range of factors”. Payne said Australia “respects the decisions of partners who have imposed sanctions” - such as the US and EU - but earlier noted that no countries in the region had chosen to do so. NSW Health has released its update: NSW recorded no new locally acquired cases of COVID-19 in the 24 hours to 8pm last night. Two new overseas-acquired cases were recorded in the same period, bringing the total number of cases in NSW since the beginning of the pandemic to 5,401. There were 18,672 tests reported to 8pm last night, compared with the previous day’s total of 21,551. NSW Health administered its highest-ever number of vaccines in one day, giving 14,595 vaccines in the 24 hours to 8pm last night, including 5,496 at the vaccination centre at Sydney Olympic Park. The total number of vaccines administered in NSW is now 1,377,812, with 461,855 doses administered by NSW Health to 8pm last night and 915,957 administered by the GP network and other providers, to 11:59pm on Tuesday 1 June 2021. Labor has accused the Morrison government of “hiding” outsourced research into jobseekers after a contract with Boston Consulting Group cost about three times initial internal estimates. Documents released to Guardian Australia under FoI show that a damning Boston Consulting Group mid-term review of the Disability Employment Services program was expected to cost between $1m and $1.5m. But the short-term contract agreed last year cost $3.3m, which Department of Social Services officials have subsequently said was amended to add $1.7m for “additional research”. Mystery surrounds the content of the research and Senate estimates heard on Thursday that Boston Consulting Group did not provide a report for the research. Officials said it was for “high-end” data analysis of the impact of Covid-19 on income support recipients. “There’s nothing you can show us that you got for it ... It’s more than the price of [Disability Employment Services review],” said the Labor senator Katy Gallagher. She said: “It looks like you’re hiding research into a contract for something else.” I can’t see how $1.76m of research, which is more than the report that you’ve commissioned, lines up ... It looks like you’ve outsourced to Boston Consulting Group what you should do on jobseeker. Officials insisted the additional $1.7m was added to the Boston Consulting Group contract within procurement rules. The department had sought advice on the matter. They also noted there was pressure on the department at the time due to the pandemic. The department agreed to provide more details about the research on notice. Kathryn Campbell, the department secretary, said it was “not the case” the department had hidden the research in another contract. Catherine Rule, another deputy secretary, also apologised for telling Senate estimates last year the Des review made no recommendations. The report, obtained by Guardian Australia under FoI, made more than 60 recommendations. Rule said she had not meant to “mislead” but had been referring to recommendations to government. The Greens senator Rachel Siewert said that response was “too cute”. Here is some of how Mike Bowers has seen the morning: It is chilly in Canberra today. Frankly though, I would have gone with an oodie. We were given a tip yesterday that home affairs staff working in Belconnen had been told to work from home while they waiting on the results of a Covid test from a Melbourne visitor last week. The department got back to us late last night: The Department can confirm that an all staff message was issued this afternoon (2 June) regarding COVID-19 precautions that have been implemented in one of our worksites. These precautions have been implemented out of an abundance of caution in light of the unfolding COVID-19 situation in Victoria and New South Wales. Bob Katter has announced he will write to Joe Biden over a US plan to ban kangaroo imports. I am sure President Biden is waiting by the mailbox for that one. Here is that whole “Frank Sinatra” approach quote from Scott Morrison to the miner’s council dinner at parliament last night. (It includes when he mixes up My Way with New York, New York. Also, Sinatra was a Democrat, so not sure he’d be in support of a conservative government, but whatever. Then there was the whole 1974 strike Sinatra caused after he disparaged female journalists, that Bob Hawke and a bottle of brandy had to step in to solve – Sinatra and Australia don’t exactly have the greatest history is what I’m saying.) Now, I want Australia to show the world how resource manufacturing and heavy industries can work in a low emissions and indeed a net zero economy when it comes to emissions. I call this the Frank Sinatra approach. We’re going to do it our way in Australia, the Australian way. If we can do it in the Pilbara, if we can do it there, we can do it anywhere, as Frank used to sing about New York. And this is the approach we have to take, Australia is going to lead the world in low emissions production in the resources sector. And the very sector, the very sector, that many far from here might suggest, might suggest that is a reason why Australia, they would allege, is not making the commitments that are necessary. Quite the reverse will be proof. In the resources sector, you will demonstrate, as you already are, how Australia will be successful in the new energy economy in adapting in new technologies, in new fuels, in new methods, in new partnerships, in new supply chains. You will demonstrate, in fact, the resources sector, in my view, will be the pin-up industry in this country for how Australia will be not just making commitments as many will want to do, but importantly are meeting those commitments and beating those commitments. Australia has already reduced emissions by over 20% on 2005 levels. Over 20%. That’s a fact. That is something that you have helped achieve. And the commitments that we’ve made out to 2030, you will help us meet. And more than help us meet it, I think you will showcase how Australia is beating them. And so the very industry that many have sought to use to try and talk Australia down when it comes to these issues, is the very industry that will prove Australia is a leader when it comes to new energy, that Australia is a leader in job generation and job creation. The Australian way, which says we can make these commitments and not forsake our heavy industries, not forsake our mining industries*. And most importantly, not forsake the people of regional Australia, who others would seek to have us ignore for the sake of pursuing those commitments. We believe both can be achieved and will be achieved, because I have great confidence in the skills and capacity of the resources sector to achieve that. We want to produce amongst the cheapest green hydrogen** in the world by 2030 and 2050. *This is not what the largest economies in the world are saying, including those countries Australia will be speaking to at the G7 **Hydrogen is only green when it comes from renewable sources. Gas is not a “green” energy source It’s 3 June – an exceptionally important day in Australian history: Labor’s Penny Wong has established that the foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, did not ask how many unaccompanied Australian minors are stranded in India. Payne explained that the department works with families on a case-by-case basis, that numbers change daily, and it “wasn’t working with a total” in that category. Wong presses – yes – but you didn’t ask? Payne replies: The answer is the children are dealt with in the family context. We were aware of the whole number of people in India, plus the vulnerable group. It’s not dealt with in the way you are asserting. Eventually, Payne concedes, saying “no”, she had not asked for a specific number of unaccompanied minors. Wong is now asking whether children were given priority to return on repatriation flights. Officials answer yes, to the extent they’re wanting to fly imminently. But only five children returned from India in the last three repatriation flights in the last week. In case you missed this yesterday, here’s what Scott Morrison will be taking in terms of talking points, when he heads to the G7 (and G7 adjacent countries) meeting later this month: And from AAP, here is what Morrison told mining executives about that meeting: The prime minister addressed mining executives ahead of the G7 summit in Cornwall. “I sort of call this the Frank Sinatra approach – we’re going to do it our way in Australia,” he said in Canberra on Wednesday night. “And if we can do it in the Pilbara, if we can do it there, we can do it anywhere.” All members of the G7 forum are committed to reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050, driven by deep emission reductions this decade. Australia, which will observe the conference from the sidelines, has not committed to the carbon target. “I want Australia to show the world how resource manufacturing and heavy industries can work in a low emissions and indeed a net-zero economy when it comes to emissions,” Mr Morrison said. Anne Ruston, the social services minister, is facing Senate estimates and being she’s tightlipped about potential support for Victoria. Ruston is responsible for the social security system, including payments like jobseeker. But disaster payments, which are being floated as a possible option, sit within the Department of Home Affairs. Ruston is not giving much away. She’s noted the comments from the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, this morning, who says the government is considering options. Asked by the Greens senator Rachel Siewert when an announcement will be made, Ruston says she will not pre-empt this. Siewert says: You accept that people will be getting desperate right now? Particularly those casual workers that are living literally from pay cheque to pay cheque, and they’re not able to work. Ruston says the situation in Victorian is of “great concern”. She repeatedly says people who need support should “test their eligibility” for existing payments such as jobseeker, though estimates hears that many affected by the lockdown will be unlikely to qualify. There has been a fiery exchange between Penny Wong and Marise Payne stemming from the discussion about stranded Australians in Senate estimates. Wong prosecutes Labor’s increasingly prominent argument about the federal government’s lack of leadership. She says the consequences are “Australians are less safe, we have more lockdowns” because Scott Morrison and others in government do not want to take responsibility for a safe system of national quarantine. Payne says “hundreds of thousands of Australians have returned to this country” since the start of the pandemic. Wong is unimpressed: There’s always a lot of words, lots of polysyllabic sentences, but the substance is your government walked away from its responsibility for safe national quarantine and you refuse to face up to the consequences of that. Payne counters: Senator, the substance is that 500,000 Australians have returned to this country in the midst of a global pandemic and that has been an extensive undertaking. And that is not to detract from the challenges that families and communities have dealt with through this process, not at all. Payne rebukes Wong for refusing to acknowledge the work of Dfat consular officials around the world have put into this difficult challenge, adding: “Your refusal to acknowledge that is, I think, most unfair.” The Liberal chair, Eric Abetz, has heard enough. He alludes to Dfat secretary Frances Adamson’s forthcoming appointment as South Australian governor: Ms Adamson, I trust Government House is going to be quieter than what you are being submitted to at the moment. Can I encourage you to go back to questions and answers. The Dfat session of Senate estimates has turned to the plight of the number of “unaccompanied minors” among the Australians who wish to return from India. Readers will recall that this was a big issue at the Covid committee on 7 May, when officials said there were “173 clients registered as under 18 in India outside a family group – that is, they’re on their own and seeking to return to Australia”. That number has now risen to 209 minors, according to today’s testimony. Lynette Wood, first assistant secretary, is not pleased with the terminology that has been used. They are not unaccompanied minors, she says, adding: A minor is only unaccompanied if they get on a plane by themselves. While these children may be in India without their parents, they are still staying “with family members or guardians”, Wood says. The Labor Senate leader, Penny Wong, replies: You don’t want to say unaccompanied because it sounds bad. Wood says that in Dfat’s registration platform, the category is described as “minors registered as single travellers”. Wong wants to know whether anyone from the minister’s office or the department had a discussion with her about not using the term unaccompanied? No. Wong then observes: To the people whose kids are over there, to have you sit there and quibble with the phrase unaccompanied minor … it’s pretty hard for people to hear. A few more responses to questions in this current bunch of questions: How many Australians in India have died from Covid-19? Dfat is aware of two. How many facilitated flights have landed in Australia since travel ban lifted on 15 May? Eight flights have landed, three to Howard Springs and one each into Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth. A further five facilitated flights are scheduled before the end of June – three from India and two from Europe. Labor backbencher Julian Hill is emerging as one of the opposition’s leading attack MPs. The Victorian MP is who is sent out when Labor has a message it wants attention for. Here’s today’s serve for Scott Morrison: I’ll bet my bottom dollar there’s no doubt that in the next couple of days, he’ll panic, he’s getting desperate. I think even he at some level realises the failure the mess that he’s making. He’ll make some kind of announcement saying, “Oh, well, we’ll build a purpose-built quarantine facility.” Well, he’s had on his desk a report for eight months telling him to do this and he’s done nothing. Jane Halton yesterday called him out for this. How can anyone trust anything this prime minister says now? Frankly, he’s a bullshit artist. He told us last year, “Don’t worry. There’ll be 4 million people vaccinated by the end of March.” He said, “Don’t worry, we’ve got aged care.” Well, when this outbreak started in Victoria, we found that 40% – only 40% – of aged care residents had been fully vaccinated; 29 homes they hadn’t even turned up for the first dose; 2% of people in disability care vaccinated. Now it sounds like I’m getting a bit personal with the prime minister. And, I am. I don’t like him. I don’t trust him. I don’t think he’s good at his job. He is a very cunning politician, but he is a failure – an absolute failure – as a leader. He failed the country on bushfires. He’s failed on hotel quarantine. He’s failing on vaccines. And now he’s failing Victoria. This bullshit artist is abandoning Victoria in our hour of need. You can expect an announcement on financial assistance for Victorian workers sometime today: The number of Australians stranded overseas now stands at just over 35,000, officials have told a Senate estimates hearing. Lynette Wood, first assistant secretary, said 35,128 Australians were registered with Dfat as wishing to return home as of 28 May, including 4,260 identified as vulnerable. India, the UK, the US, the Philippines and Thailand are the top five countries where they are located. Wood said the number registered in India was 10,994, including 1024 classified as vulnerable. About a month ago we were told the number of Australians registered as wishing to return from overseas stood at 34,500. The social services minister, Anne Ruston, has apologised for a privacy breach that saw a victim’s private and harrowing details of institutional child sexual abuse uploaded to another survivor’s MyGov account. The case was reported by the Ten Network last night. Asked about the case by the Labor senator Jenny McAllister, Ruston said the department was doing its best to ensure such a breach did not happen again: I can only apologise for what’s happened. “It just strikes me that this is a significant breach,” McAllister said. Ruston said she was happy to speak to the survivor if they wanted. The Department of Social Services has launched an internal investigationr. Josh Frydenberg has been doing the media rounds this morning, laying the groundwork for the federal government providing some sort of financial support for Victorian workers facing two weeks with no pay due to the lockdown, but not actually committing to it as yet. The government doesn’t want to set a precedent where states could potentially find it easier to order lockdowns (which is not something the federal government has ever wanted) so you’ll hear a lot about “principles” and “national standards”. National cabinet meets tomorrow. Eighteen months into the pandemic and there is still not a framework for what would trigger the sort of financial support people need when lockdowns occur – even though the federal budget is built on the assumption there will be more lockdowns. The foreign affairs estimates hearing has begun with bipartisan praise for Frances Adamson, the Dfat secretary who will soon leave the department to take up the role of South Australian governor. The Liberal party chair of the committee, Eric Abetz, and Labor’s Penny Wong both acknowledged it would be her last estimates session and thanked her for her service under both sides of government. Wong thanked Adamson for respecting parliament and the estimates process – an attitude Wong said was not universal. Adamson was the first woman to serve as Dfat secretary and the first woman to be Australian ambassador to China. The foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, described Adamson as an “exceptional diplomat and public servant”. In an opening statement, Payne provided a broader overview of Australia’s foreign policy priorities. Payne said Australia’s focus had been “strong engagement” with its neighbours on vaccines, with the provision of 200,000 doses manufactured in Australia to Pacific nations and Timor-Leste. She said Australia welcomed the comprehensive report into the pandemic co-led by the former New Zealand prime minister Helen Clark. Payne has met with Clark in New Zealand and she said they were positively disposed to seeing constructive further investigations into the matter. Payne said multilateral organisations needed to evolve; Australia was working with partners to push for reform of institutions including the World Health Organization and World Trade Organization. We don’t yet have an update on the number of stranded Australians (Adamson said the government had facilitated eight flights from India in last three weeks), but it will come up in questioning. Payne said: The pandemic continues to present us with enormous challenges … that does affect our consular support as well. Also in estimates today is the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. There are still thousands of Australians stranded overseas, including Australians trying to get home from India. Daniel Hurst will bring you those updates. It is important to note that despite Victorian government officials’ claims that the kappa variant in Melbourne is a “beast” spreading in ways not seen before including “low contact” and “fleeting” contact, the World Health Organization does not classify the variant in Melbourne – dubbed the kappa variant – as a variant of concern (VOC). Kappa is at the moment graded a variant of interest (VOI). VOC have increased transmissibility, virulence or change in clinical disease, and a decreased effectiveness of public health and social measures. VOIs, such as Kappa, are those shown to cause community transmission in multiple clusters and have been detected in multiple countries, but have not yet necessarily proven to be more virulent or transmissible. I’ll bring you some of Luke’s observations – there is no one better covering these issues across the nation right now: While the federal government waits to say whether it will provide financial support to Victorian workers who are facing two weeks without pay because of the lockdown (Brisbane’s lockdown was three days and was only in the city – it was pretty much situation normal in the rest of Queensland, and WA locked down the Perth and Peel region for just three days, so comparing what Victoria is going through to those earlier lockdowns is ridiculous) it’s worth taking a look at the language government ministers are using. Here was David Coleman on the ABC yesterday when he was asked about it: The provision of support to Victoria since Covid has been immense: $45bn from the Commonwealth, the highest provision per capita of anywhere in Australia, and in addition to the $13bn of support that the Victorian state government has provided itself, so there’s already been an enormous amount of support. Coleman had a year’s paid personal leave from December 2019. He was able to deal with what he had to deal with because he had ongoing financial support. He didn’t have to worry about paying bills while he dealt with issues. No one should hold that against him – that is the system we should have. But it should also be applied across the board. A week’s pay matters. A lot. Two weeks; pay can be the difference between maintaining housing or not. It once took me six months to catch up financially after I lost two weeks’ pay due to illness while a casual worker. I was lucky I could do it. Many aren’t. This wait is doing no one any good. I am assuming one of these is the second aged care resident at the Arcare Maidstone facility we learnt about late yesterday afternoon. These results are from more than 57,500 tests. I know I have said this all week, but Victoria – you do us all proud. Estimates continued last night. Here are two sides of one exchange, when Liberal NSW senator Hollie Hughes was determined to have how proud she was of NSW’s “gold standard” on the record as CMO Prof Paul Kelly gave an update on Victoria’s situation. Hughes tried to talk about the “failure we are seeing in [Victoria’s] hotel quarantine”, sparking a ruckus as the non-government senators reminded her this outbreak stemmed from a breach in South Australia’s hotel quarantine. “We know Victoria is winning one race and that would be the lockdown race,” Hughes finished. AAP has the latest on the NSW exposure sites: More alerts have been issued for possible COVID-19 exposure sites by NSW Health as almost 250 people remain in isolation on the South Coast. Alerts were issued on Wednesday night for venues in Gundagai, Goulburn, Jervis Bay, Huskisson and Vincentia that were visited by a Melbourne family of four last month, who were later diagnosed with COVID-19 after returning home. The father had symptoms on May 25 after driving back to Melbourne on May 24. He tested positive on Monday, nearly a week later, as did his wife and children. There have been no cases recorded in NSW but several new testing facilities on the South Coast have been testing locals amid concerns the virus could have spread. The results of some of those tests should be known on Thursday. Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant on Wednesday said NSW Health was working with Victorian authorities to determine who in the family contracted the virus first. “If this gentleman was the source for those individuals, then they were not potentially infectious when they were in NSW, and clearly if the reverse is the case that may take back the exposure period,” she told reporters. Already 243 people have been instructed to get tested and isolate while they await further instructions from NSW Health. “We’ve asked [them] to stop and stay until we actually really understand and do a full assessment of the risk,” Dr Chant said. Victorian authorities believe the strain circulating in the state is much more infectious than previous variants, capable of transmitting between strangers with very minimal contact. Those concerns prompted the Victorian government to extend the lockdown for Greater Melbourne for at least another seven days until midnight on June 10. However, Dr Chant downplayed those fears, saying NSW has also had occasions of transmission with very minimal contact. Premier Gladys Berejiklian said the scare is a reminder of the urgent need for people to get vaccinated, and for testing rates to remain high. “They know the drill when there are cases in other parts of Australia,” Ms Berejiklian said. “We’ve seen more than 21,000 people come forward in the last 24 hours in NSW and get tested – that’s outstanding.” Josh Frydenberg said a decision on a dedicated quarantine facility in Victoria is just “days” away: Obviously, you’re talking large sums of money and talking through the details of the location, because more than one location was put forward. And obviously, we’ve had conversations with the state government there. And it’s important to understand that that designated facility in Victoria would be over and above the existing hotel quarantine quarantine facility that exists in important and other states … Well, days. That’s how I would put it. And obviously, the prime minister and my cabinet colleagues have been discussing these matters. Again, Josh Frydenberg is not ruling out support – but he is not announcing it either: Other states went through short-term lockdowns – namely Queensland and Western Australia. They didn’t ask for extra support*. They didn’t receive extra federal support and that was after the end of jobkeeper. But now that the lockdown has been extended, then we obviously are considering the implications of that and we do understand the need that Victorian families and businesses have right now. And hopefully, when the details of those, the easing of restrictions are announced by the state government, that that will come as some relief, particularly to regional Victorians, because you’ve got a situation in a regional city like Mildura who are probably watching your show today. More than 50,000 people. Cases where there wasn’t one for 13 months and yet they were subject to the same restrictions and lockdown at the people in inner Melbourne. So all those responses and decisions by the state government really do need to be proportionate to the challenges that we face. *This is not comparing apples and apples. Brisbane was locked down for THREE days Josh Frydenberg is on ABC News Breakfast, where he is talking around the idea of a one-off payment for Victorian workers but not going into any details: Well, the pandemic is not over, and neither is the support from the Morrison government. Last night I had a constructive conversation with my Victorian counterpart, treasurer Tim Pallas. The prime minister spoke to the acting premier, James Merlino. We recognise that with the extension of the lockdown, Victorian families and businesses are doing it tough, as you know. In Victoria, people have been subject to now a fourth lockdown, something that other states have been spared, and the Morrison government has been there for not just Victorians but for Australians from day one of this crisis, and will continue to provide that support. So, we’ll stick to the principles that have guided us to date with our economic support packages, namely that it will be temporary, that it will be targeted, that they will be measured and that they’ll be using existing systems. And we’ll have more to say about that in due course. Which is pretty much what he was saying yesterday as well. Paul Karp has taken another look at the sports rorts affair: Sport Australia’s claim in court that it provided final approval of $100m of grants in the sports rorts program has been undercut by evidence to the Senate inquiry that Bridget McKenzie overturned decisions and gave permission to vary grants. Minutes from Sport Australia’s finance audit and risk committee revealed that in December 2018 it believed the then-sport minister had “overturned” its recommendations, a “variation in the approval process” that it noted as a risk. But in the federal court, where it is defending the legality of the program against Beechworth Lawn Tennis Club, Sport Australia claimed it retained the final say on which applications would be approved for funding. It will be a little while before Daniel Andrews is back at work. But the tweet threads are back. The Victorian premier is still on medical leave but has tweeted out his thoughts on lockdown: Geriatric millennials and Gen X, your time has come in the ACT. It’s the last day of parliament for parliament (but it will be back in a week) and estimates continue, but everyone is waiting to see how the federal government will respond to Victoria’s extended lockdown, given that workers are now facing two weeks without pay. Acting premier James Merlino had talks with Scott Morrison overnight, while Josh Frydenberg spoke with his Victorian counterpart Tim Pallas. We know jobkeeper is out. But disaster-style payments, which already exist for states and territories when natural disasters strike, is one option. Which makes sense. Losing even a week of pay without notice is a disaster for a lot of people. Rent, loans and utilities all still need to be paid, even in a pandemic. Plus, people need to eat. We’ll be hearing from Frydenberg soon. It’s been a long week for millions of people, so hopefully we’ll have answers for you soon. Victorians have responded to the latest outbreak by getting vaccinated in record numbers but, as Christopher Knaus reports, the commonwealth hasn’t increased vaccine supply to Victoria in response. That has led to people being turned away, including aged and disability care workers, who are trying to work out their own vaccinations, given that the only way they can receive that at their work is if there are leftover doses from those supplied for residents. We should find out today whether restrictions ease in regional Victoria but it’s another long week for Melbourne residents after the lockdown was extended for seven more days. We’ll bring you all the news on that as well as what’s happening in and around parliament. Mike Bowers and his cameras are already working away, and you have Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin and Paul Karp with you ferreting out all the news in Canberra.

Speaking at the Universities Australia conference, Tudge said he hoped international students could return in “small pilot programs” this year, describing a recent proposal from South Australia to bring back a small group of international students as “promising”. Speaking at the conference for the first time as education minister, Tudge also said the government would consider drafting legislation to force universities to sign up to a free speech code. While universities face losses estimated at more than $2bn in 2020-21 and slashed thousands of jobs due to border closures affecting international students, Tudge said on Thursday morning there was “relative positive news” on enrolments. “The impact on enrolments, at least on aggregate, has not been as great as what we might have initially expected,” he said. “I looked at the most recent figures last night, and they show that international student enrolments at university are down only 11% at this point in time compared to the same point in time in 2019. “And now with international students comprising about 27% of all university revenue, that means … you’ve had a loss of about 3% of revenue compared to 2019 figures.” Tudge acknowledged these were “aggregate numbers” and some universities would have suffered more. He also acknowledged “commencement figures of international students are very significantly down”. “I appreciate that lower enrolments this year have an impact over multiple years,” he said. Other data however suggests the number of new international students has nearly halved since 2019, including a 43,000 drop during the pandemic, between 2020 and 2021. More than 17,000 people lost their jobs at Australian universities during the pandemic, as public universities were not able to access jobkeeper. A recent report from Victoria University’s Mitchell Institute also found that not having international students in Australia, where they spend on retail and accommodation, would cost the broader economy nearly $20bn by next year. International students have been able to enrol at Australian universities even as borders remain closed, with many studying online remotely. Tudge told the conference, a gathering of vice-chancellors, university staff and educators, two small pilot programs in South Australia and New South Wales could bring international students back within months. However, he made no promises on when large numbers of students would return. “When will the borders open? And when will we receive larger student numbers returning? I can’t answer that question,” he said. “I don’t think anyone can say with any certainty … The budget assumption is that we’ll have large numbers of international students back again at the second half of 2022. My hope is that we’ll have smaller-scale pilots of international students in the next few months. And I received a a proposal from South Australia just last Friday, and it looks promising. NSW is also likely to propose to provide a proposal very shortly.” Both the SA and NSW plans would require federal government approval before they can go ahead. The SA plan would quarantine students in buildings at Parafield airport, outside of the hotel quarantine system. NSW would quarantine students in empty student accommodation, also outside of the hotel quarantine system, with one 600-bed site already earmarked. Tudge said the government wants to see 10 million international students studying for Australian qualifications, either online or in person, within 10 years. But he said universities should work to diversify to reduce reliance on China and India, which account for 55% of current international students. “Not only does this limit the diversity of perspectives in classrooms, but it also lowers the resilience of our universities to changes in global demand,” he said. “So I’m asking you to please think deeply about how we can do this.” But the minister also called on universities to start prioritising Australian domestic students, including “a return of the previous face-to-face learning where Covid rules allow”. “Public universities were initially established for one purpose, and that was to educate Australians,” he said. Tudge said he had heard from “too many” students and parents who wanted more face-to-face learning. “When you look at the student experience surveys based on last year’s experience, they weren’t great,” he said. “And we understand there were obvious reasons for that. “But I am still hearing from too many students directly, or their parents, and I hear this all the time, who tell me that their usual student experience has still not returned. They may have got only one contact hour per week – despite the fact that when they enrolled in the particular course, there was an expectation that this was a course which had tutorials and lectures in person. “This must start with a return of the previous face-to-face learning where Covid rules allow. Clearly that can’t happen in Victoria right now.” Tudge concluded his remarks by asking universities to sign up to the French model code on free speech – a voluntary code developed by former high court chief justice Robert French after the government set up an inquiry into university freedom of speech. The minister said eight universities had not yet signed up to the code, and threatened “all options”, including legislation, to enforce it. “I want to see the model code implemented fully this year – with no more excuses,” he said. “You’re all committed to do this. And if it comes apparent that universities remain unable or unwilling to adopt the model code, we will be examining all options available to governments to enforce it, which may include legislation.” Tanya Plibersek will also address the conference on Thursday, pledging to restore Australia’s universities “to their rightful place” if Labor wins the next federal election. The shadow education minister will say that universities would have access to Labor’s $15bn national reconstruction fund to “translate your brilliant discoveries and inventions into new Australian businesses and new Australian jobs”. While Labor is yet to address funding for the sector substantively, Plibersek’s speech also contains a hint on uncapping places. She will note access to places is a “growing problem” that Labor will work with the sector to resolve because “every Australian kid who works hard and gets the marks should have a chance to go to university – if they want to”.","charCount":"6661","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/naaman-zhou\">Naaman Zhou</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2021/jun/03/melbourne-lockdown-covid-victoria-restrictions-coronavirus-rules-covid19-explained-5km-radius-masks-compulsory-exercising-home-gatherings-what-you-need-to-know","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-03T02:05:04Z","webTitle":"Covid Victoria lockdown restrictions: Melbourne and regional Vic new coronavirus rules explained","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/jun/03/melbourne-lockdown-covid-victoria-restrictions-coronavirus-rules-covid19-explained-5km-radius-masks-compulsory-exercising-home-gatherings-what-you-need-to-know","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2021/jun/03/melbourne-lockdown-covid-victoria-restrictions-coronavirus-rules-covid19-explained-5km-radius-masks-compulsory-exercising-home-gatherings-what-you-need-to-know","fields":{"headline":"Covid Victoria lockdown restrictions: Melbourne and regional Vic new coronavirus rules explained","standfirst":"<p>New Victorian Covid-19 restrictions have been announced in response to a growing number of cases in the Melbourne coronavirus outbreak.

Childcare, early learning centres and kindergartens are still open. In regional Victoria face-to-face learning returns for all year levels. Can I dine in at a restaurant or cafe? Not in Melbourne. Restaurants, cafes and pubs will be open for takeaway only. In regional Victoria, it is open for seated service only, with a maximum patron cap of 50 people, group sizes of a maximum of 10 people and density of one person per four square metres. Are the shops open? In Melbourne, essential retail, such as supermarkets, petrol, pharmacies, bottle shops and banks, will be open. But other shops will be open only for click and collect. In regional Victoria, retail can open with a density of one person per four square metres. Across Victoria all venues are now required to make people sign in to the Service Vic QR code app. What about weddings, funerals and religious services? In Melbourne, only 10 people will be allowed to attend funerals in person. No weddings are allowed unless for end-of-life or deportation reasons. No religious activities are allowed in-person beyond five people. In regional Victoria, weddings can have 10 people. Funerals can have no more than 50 people, but children under 12 months do not count in this cap. What about aged care and hospitals? Across Victoria, no visitors are allowed at aged care facilities except for limited reasons. There will be no visitors to hospitals allowed except for end of life, if you’re a partner during the birth of your child, or a parent accompanying a child. Can I go and get vaccinated? Getting vaccinated is one of the reasons people who are eligible to receive the jab can leave home. The Victorian government has expanded the eligibility to include those aged between 40-49 for state-operated vaccination sites. People in this category can now call the hotline on 1800 675 398 to book an appointment. What about heading back to the office? In Melbourne if people can work from home they must work from home. In regional Victoria, if people can work from home they must work from home, but workplaces can have up to 50% of staff in the office, or maximum 20 people, whichever is greater.

A summer of freedom. A summer of joy. A summer of get-togethers and celebrations. An all-American summer that this country deserves after a long, long dark winter that we have all endured.” Biden has set a goal of having 70% of American adults at least partially vaccinated by July 4.</li> \n   <li><strong>Biden met with Shelley Moore Capito to discuss Senate Republicans’ latest infrastructure proposal. </strong>The White House said the two had a “constructive and frank” discussion on infrastructure legislation.

But, on graduation day, “in light of recent events, it feels wrong to talk about anything but what is currently affecting me and millions of other women in this state,” she said, her voice shaking as she began. </p> \n  <p>“Starting in September, there will be a ban on abortion after six weeks of pregnancy, regardless of whether the pregnancy was the result of rape or incest,” Smith said. </p> \n  <p>The state’s governor, Greg Abbott, signed into law a bill last month a near-total ban on abortions, prohibiting the procedure at six weeks, when most people do not even know that they are pregnant. The extreme ban also allows private citizens to sue any abortion provider or anyone who “aids and abets” an abortion that violates the restriction – opening the floodgates to harassment and frivolous lawsuits. </p> \n  <p>“I have dreams, hopes and ambitions,” Smith said. “Every girl here does. We have spent our whole lives working towards our futures, and without our consent or input, our control over our futures has been stripped away from us.”</p> \n  <p>“I am terrified that if my contraceptives fail me, that if I’m raped, then my hopes and efforts and dreams for myself will no longer be relevant,” she added. “I hope you can feel how gut-wrenching it is, how dehumanizing it is, to have the autonomy over your own body taken from you.”<br></p> \n  <p>The speech has been viewed hundreds of thousands of times on TikTok. </p> \n  <p>Smith <a href=\"https://www.dmagazine.com/frontburner/2021/06/lake-highlands-high-valedictorian-pulls-switcheroo-on-commencement-speech/\">told</a> D Magazine that the viral fame has felt “weird for me personally,”, though she’s pleased that the issues she raised are getting attention.

Capito, of West Virginia, has been leading Republicans’ talks with the Biden administration. But it’s unclear whether the two parties can reach a compromise on infrastructure. Republicans responded to Democrats’ sweeping $1.7tn proposal with a $928bn counteroffer.

She had a writing background, was having trouble finding work in New York City, and thought she could make some money while looking for a better fit.</p> \n  <p>By the time she left less than a year later, Susan said, she was drinking to excess because of work stress, had trouble sleeping and had, at one point, cracked her tooth clenching her jaw while listening to hours of talking on the police scanner. As her mental health declined, her bosses at Citizen were not supportive, Susan said.</p> \n  <p>“They don’t even know what is going on in our ears,” said Susan, who the Guardian is identifying by a pseudonym due to fear of repercussions from the company.<em> </em>She recalled feeling regularly pressured to keep up appearances, despite the increasingly distressing content workers like her were moderating.<br></p> \n  <p>“The job is akin to most internet moderation, but in some ways it is worse because you are looking at videos directly from the scene of a bloody crash, often near where you live,” she said. “You are listening to the most insane shit.”</p> \n  <p>Citizen uses location data to feed <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/citizen/\">millions of users</a> local crime information that it collects via police scanners.

A summer of freedom. A summer of joy. A summer of get-togethers and celebrations. An all-American summer that this country deserves after a long, long dark winter that we have all endured.” Biden has set a goal of having 70% of American adults at least partially vaccinated by July 4.</li> \n   <li><strong>Biden met with Shelley Moore Capito to discuss Senate Republicans’ latest infrastructure proposal. </strong>The president and Capito, who is leading the Republican negotiating team, discussed the state of infrastructure negotiations for about an hour.

A cafe in the town of Mendocino made headlines after announcing it will charge customers a $5 fee if they order while wearing a mask.

Announcing his administration’s “month of action” to increase coronavirus vaccinations by July 4, Biden said, “America is heading into a summer dramatically different from last year’s summer. A summer of freedom. A summer of joy. A summer of get-togethers and celebrations. An all-American summer that this country deserves after a long, long dark winter that we have all endured.” Biden has set a goal of having 70% of American adults at least partially vaccinated by July 4. Biden met with Shelley Moore Capito to discuss Senate Republicans’ latest infrastructure proposal. The White House said the two had a “constructive and frank” discussion on infrastructure legislation. But it’s unclear whether a compromise will be possible. Republicans responded to Democrats’ sweeping $1.7tn proposal with a $928bn counteroffer that lacked many provisions that Biden has championed. The Israeli opposition leader has told the country’s president that he can form a government. The announcement from Yair Lapid marks a crucial step toward bringing an end to 12 years of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s leadership, but lawmakers still have to vote on the deal, which may happen as soon as next week. The White House said Biden and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, will discuss recent ransomware attacks on major companies when they meet in Switzerland later this month. Administration officials have previously indicated that they believe the attacks on Colonial Pipeline and JBS were carried out by criminal groups based in Russia. “President Biden certainly thinks Putin and the Russian government have a role to play in stopping these attacks,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said. The NAACP president, Derrick Johnson, will meet with West Virginia senator and key Democratic holdout on a sweeping voting rights measure Joe Manchin. Manchin has called the Democratic For the People Act “too darn broad” and partisan. The sweeping bill would expand ballot access, nullify some voting restrictions enacted by Republicans, and establish support for District of Columbia statehood, among other things. Donald Trump shuttered his blog, “From the Desk of Donald J Trump,” after less than a month. According to the Washington Post, the former president was displeased by the blog’s low readership numbers and the ridicule it attracted after debuting last month. – Joan E Greve and Maanvi Singh Nasa is returning to Venus for the first time in more than three decades to gain a better understanding of the history of what scientists believe could have been the first habitable planet in the solar system. Plans for two separate and ambitious deep space missions to Earth’s nearest neighbour were announced on Wednesday by the head of the US space agency, Bill Nelson. Launches were targeted for a 2028-2030 time frame, he said. Nasa has set aside $1bn (£700m) in developmental funding for the two ventures, which will be the first US exploration of the planet since 1989. The Magellan spacecraft that managers sent plunging into the oblivion of Venus’s atmosphere in 1994 at the end of its five-year mission provided never-before-seen imagery of the planet’s cratered and volcanic surface that Nasa now seeks to research further. “It is astounding how little we know about Venus, but the combined results of these missions will tell us about the planet from the clouds in its sky through the volcanoes on its surface all the way down to its very core,” Tom Wagner, lead scientist of Nasa’s discovery program, said. “It will be as if we have rediscovered the planet.” The first mission selected by the space agency from a shortlist of four concepts first announced in February 2020 is Davinci+ (deep atmosphere Venus investigation of noble gases, chemistry and imaging).

The Caspar Star Tribute reports: Cheney had never previously spent any money on security services during the first quarter of non-election years. And over her past three House campaigns combined, she spent less than $2,000 on security services and never more than $1,012 in a single campaign. “We don’t comment on security,” said Jeremy Adler, Cheney’s director of communications. Cheney’s security was notably heavier than in the past when she visited the Star-Tribune’s office last week. Cheney was ousted from House Republican leadership after she refused to support the Trump lie that he actually won the 2020 elections, and condemned Trump supporters’ 6th January attack on the captiol. Paxton Smith, the valedictorian of Lake Highlands high school’s class of 2021, went off-script in her graduation speech. School administrators had signed off on her pre-written address on how TV and media have shaped her worldview. But, on graduation day, “in light of recent events, it feels wrong to talk about anything but what is currently affecting me and millions of other women in this state,” she said, her voice shaking as she began. “Starting in September, there will be a ban on abortion after six weeks of pregnancy, regardless of whether the pregnancy was the result of rape or incest,” Smith said. The state’s governor, Greg Abbott, signed into law a bill last month a near-total ban on abortions, prohibiting the procedure at six weeks, when most people do not even know that they are pregnant. The extreme ban also allows private citizens to sue any abortion provider or anyone who “aids and abets” an abortion that violates the restriction – opening the floodgates to harassment and frivolous lawsuits. “I have dreams, hopes and ambitions,” Smith said. “Every girl here does. We have spent our whole lives working towards our futures, and without our consent or input, our control over our futures has been stripped away from us.” “I am terrified that if my contraceptives fail me, that if I’m raped, then my hopes and efforts and dreams for myself will no longer be relevant,” she added. “I hope you can feel how gut-wrenching it is, how dehumanizing it is, to have the autonomy over your own body taken from you.” The speech has been viewed hundreds of thousands of times on TikTok. Smith told D Magazine that the viral fame has felt “weird for me personally,”, though she’s pleased that the issues she raised are getting attention. She also urged people to vote, “and to stay involved in local elections because those have more power than I think the media gives them credit for”. The White House said Joe Biden and Republican senator Shelley Moore Capito had a “constructive and frank” discussion on infrastructure legislation. “This afternoon, the president hosted senator Capito for a constructive and frank conversation in the Oval Office about how we can drive economic growth and benefit America’s middle class through investing in our infrastructure,” the White House said in a statement. “The two agreed to reconnect on Friday,” according to the White House. The president did not take questions from reporters following the meeting. Capito, of West Virginia, has been leading Republicans’ talks with the Biden administration. But it’s unclear whether the two parties can reach a compromise on infrastructure. Republicans responded to Democrats’ sweeping $1.7tn proposal with a $928bn counteroffer. Opposing the Democrats’ proposed increase of corporate tax rate to at from 21% to at least 25%, Republicans instead suggested that their plan could be funded by repurposing coronavirus relief funds. The Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, said Democrats would seek to pass an infrastructure bill with or without Republican support this summer. Susan, a former employee for the crime app Citizen, applied for a job curating the platform’s content and notifications in 2019 “in a pinch”. She had a writing background, was having trouble finding work in New York City, and thought she could make some money while looking for a better fit. By the time she left less than a year later, Susan said, she was drinking to excess because of work stress, had trouble sleeping and had, at one point, cracked her tooth clenching her jaw while listening to hours of talking on the police scanner. As her mental health declined, her bosses at Citizen were not supportive, Susan said. “They don’t even know what is going on in our ears,” said Susan, who the Guardian is identifying by a pseudonym due to fear of repercussions from the company. She recalled feeling regularly pressured to keep up appearances, despite the increasingly distressing content workers like her were moderating. “The job is akin to most internet moderation, but in some ways it is worse because you are looking at videos directly from the scene of a bloody crash, often near where you live,” she said. “You are listening to the most insane shit.” Citizen uses location data to feed millions of users local crime information that it collects via police scanners. The app made headlines earlier this month for offering $30,000 to anyone who could find a man accused of starting a California wildfire, raising a number of ethical concerns. But former employees say the episode is far from the only troubling one at the company, and that the startup has long been a toxic place to work. “The job is very hard, it’s very traumatic, and it takes a lot of skilled labor,” Susan said. “It attracts a creative, smart, empathetic person. But there is a disconnect between that and the bosses who don’t appear to care about our wellbeing at all.” Citizen disputes the claims. “Our employees are our lifeblood,” a Citizen spokesperson said, adding that the company “takes great care to prioritize their health and wellbeing”. Read more: NAACP president Derrick Johnson will meet with West Virginia senator and key Democratic holdout on a sweeping voting rights measure Joe Manchin. Johnson, who is set to meet with Manchin next Tuesday, along with representatives of other voting rights groups, said he “looks forward to a robust and productive conversation”. “We must do everything we can to protect the American people’s sacred right to participate in the democratic process. Our vote is our voice, and we will not be silenced,” the NAACP said. Manchin has called the Democratic For the People Act “too darn broad” and partisan. The sweeping bill would expand ballot access, nullify some voting restrictions enacted by Republicans, and establish support for District of Columbia statehood, among other things. The centrist senator has also been one of the top defenders of the filibuster, a procedural obstacle that makes it impossible to pass most bills through the Senate without a 60-vote supermajority. Even if Machin voted for the Democrats’ voting rights bill, with the filibuster in place, in an evenly divided chamber, the party would have to win over at least 10 Republicans in order to pass the legislation – something that’s highly unlikely to ever happen. That’s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here’s where the day stands so far: Joe Biden promised Americans a “summer of freedom” as he urged more people to get vaccinated against coronavirus. Announcing his administration’s “month of action” to increase coronavirus vaccinations by July 4, Biden said, “America is heading into a summer dramatically different from last year’s summer. A summer of freedom. A summer of joy. A summer of get-togethers and celebrations. An all-American summer that this country deserves after a long, long dark winter that we have all endured.” Biden has set a goal of having 70% of American adults at least partially vaccinated by July 4. Biden met with Shelley Moore Capito to discuss Senate Republicans’ latest infrastructure proposal. The president and Capito, who is leading the Republican negotiating team, discussed the state of infrastructure negotiations for about an hour. The meeting comes almost a week after Capito and her group called for spending $928 billion on infrastructure over the next eight years, far less than what Biden has proposed. The Israeli opposition leader has told the country’s president that he can form a government. The announcement from Yair Lapid marks a crucial step toward bringing an end to 12 years of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s leadership, but lawmakers still have to vote on the deal, which may happen as soon as next week. The White House said Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin will discuss recent ransomware attacks on major companies when they meet in Switzerland later this month. Administration officials have previously indicated that they believe the attacks on Colonial Pipeline and JBS were carried out by criminal groups based in Russia. “President Biden certainly thinks Putin and the Russian government have a role to play in stopping these attacks,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said. Donald Trump shuttered his blog, “From the Desk of Donald J. Trump,” after less than a month. According to the Washington Post, the former president was displeased by the blog’s low readership numbers and the ridicule it attracted after debuting last month. Maanvi will have more coming up, so stay tuned. The step by Yair Lapid does not immediately end Benjamin Netanyahu’s 12-year stretch in power or conclude a political deadlock that has brought four snap elections since 2019. Before that happens, lawmakers will need to vote on the deal, which is expected next week. Then there will be a swearing-in. Until that happens, Netanyahu is expected to continue his attempts to get any lawmakers to defect so Lapid does not have a 61-seat majority in the 120-seat Knesset. Under the proposed deal, Lapid will not immediately take high office. Instead, his political rival and far-right politician Naftali Bennett, whose support was vital to the coalition’s success, will become prime minister for the first two years. The Israeli opposition leader has told the country’s president that he can form a government, a critical step that places Benjamin Netanyahu in his most precarious political position for more than a decade. After days of frenetic negotiations, Yair Lapid told President Reuven Rivlin on Wednesday that he has the support of a majority of opposition parties for what has been dubbed a “government of change” – a mix of bitter ideological rivals united by a shared desire to oust Israel’s longest-serving leader. “I am honoured to inform you that I have succeeded in forming a government,” Lapid told the president in a letter. He added: “I commit to you Mr President, that this government will work to serve all the citizens of Israel including those who aren’t members of it, will respect those who oppose it, and do everything in its power to unite all parts of Israeli society.” Crucially, Lapid secured backing from powerful far-right Jewish politicians, but also a small party of Arab Islamists who signed roughly two hours before the deadline. In doing so, the United Arab List became the first party from the country’s sizeable Arab minority to ever join a government. Its leader, Mansour Abbas, is a pragmatist and has sought greater resources and rights for Palestinian citizens of Israel. Joe and Jill Biden will soon leave Washington to spend a couple of days at their Rehoboth Beach home, where they will celebrate the first lady’s 70th birthday. The AP reports: President Joe Biden and his wife were heading to their Delaware beach house Wednesday evening to help the first lady celebrate that personal milestone on Thursday. The trip makes for a rare midweek getaway from the White House by a president. It will also be the president’s first visit to the couple’s Rehoboth Beach home since he took office in January. The Bidens were expected to be back at the White House on Friday. A Daily Mail reporter noted today that Biden-inspired artwork has been popping up in the Rehoboth Beach area, where the first family has owned a house since 2017. Joe Biden’s meeting with Republican Senator Shelley Moore Capito to discuss a potential infrastructure deal concluded after about an hour. The press was not allowed into the meeting, but the White House will likely soon release a readout of the discussion between the president and Capito, who is leading the Republican negotiating team. Stay tuned. Erin McCormick reports for the Guardian from Berkeley, California: Rural northern California is seeing a troubling rise in Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations, an alarming trend that comes as residents and businesses continue to protest against safety measures and vaccinations – with one Mendocino cafe threatening to charge customers $5 for wearing a mask. While the region makes up a small proportion of the state’s population, the growth in its caseload has been considerable, and comes at a time when the state overall is enjoying some of the lowest rates of Covid in the country. After largely avoiding the worst of the pandemic, a block of far northern California counties now leads the state with nearly 40 cases per 100,000 residents over the past week, according to statistics maintained by the Los Angeles Times. Tehama county ranked the highest in the LA Times case ratings with 139 cases per 100,000 residents. Meanwhile 10 of the 21 total Covid deaths in nearby Siskiyou county have occurred since the beginning of May. The region has long been one of the most forceful in its pushback against measures such as masks, business restrictions and vaccine mandates – and the protests have only continued to gain steam. A cafe in the town of Mendocino made headlines after announcing it will charge customers a $5 fee if they order while wearing a mask. It also threatened to charge $5 to anyone “caught bragging about your vaccine”. Donald Trump ordered his blog shuttered because of its poor readership and the ridicule it was attracting, one adviser to the former president told the Washington Post. The Post reports: Former president Donald Trump’s blog, celebrated by advisers as a ‘beacon of freedom’ that would keep him relevant in an online world he once dominated, is dead. It was 29 days old. Upset by reports from The Washington Post and other outlets highlighting its measly readership and concerns that it could detract from a social media platform he wants to launch later this year, Trump ordered his team Tuesday to put the blog out of its misery, advisers said. On its last day, the site received just 1,500 shares or comments on Facebook and Twitter — a staggering drop for someone whose every tweet once garnered hundreds of thousands of reactions. Trump still wants to launch some other platform — timing not yet determined — and didn’t like that this first attempt was being mocked as a loser, according to a Trump adviser who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk frankly about the former president’s plans. The blog was clearly meant to help Trump amplify his political message after he was suspended from Twitter and Facebook for inciting the January 6 insurrection. However, the page did not have the kind of interactive features available on all major social media platforms, so users were unable to directly respond to Trump’s statements. That unsuccessful dynamic seems to have led to the blog’s early demise. Joe Biden’s meeting with Republican Senator Shelley Moore Capito has now started, according to the latest White House press pool report. The president and the senator are expected to discuss the latest infrastructure offer from Capito and her group of fellow Republicans, who have been negotiating with the White House in recent weeks. Republicans have proposed spending $928 billion on infrastructure over the next eight years. However, only $257 billion in that proposal is considered new funds; the rest is baseline spending, meaning money that was already going to be used on infrastructure projects because of existing policies. In contrast, Biden has proposed spending $1.7 trillion over baseline spending levels on infrastructure. So the two sides remain far apart in their negotiations, and this meeting will likely determine whether any bipartisan deal can be reached. Following on from news out of the White House press conference earlier that Joe Biden will directly bring up with Vladimir Putin of Russia the subject of ransomware attacks on US entities perpetrated by Russian criminal gangs, there was a shouted question at the end of the US president’s address on Covid-19. The G7 meeting begins in the UK mid-month. It’s been a lively morning in US political news and there’s more to come so do stay tuned. Joe Biden is meeting at the White House now with West Virginia Republican Senator Shelley Moore Capito in a late push for a bipartisan deal on infrastructure legislation. Here are the other main events of the day so far: US president Joe Biden touts the prospect of a “summer of freedom” but urges those reluctant to get vaccinated against coronavirus. Biden will directly discuss the rash of ransomware cyber attacks on US entities, from local government computer systems, to a gas pipeline to the biggest US meat processing company, when he meets with Russian president Vladimir Putin at the upcoming G7 talks in Britain. Donald Trump has shuttered the blog that he started less than a month ago, a senior adviser to the former president said. Katie Hobbs, Arizona’s top election official who became one of the leading voices beating back conspiracies about the 2020 election, announced she was seeking the Democratic nomination for governor in her state. Joe Biden outlined his administration’s new efforts to make it easier than ever for Americans to get their coronavirus vaccinations. Among other initiatives, four of the largest US childcare providers will offer free childcare for caregivers who are getting the vaccine or recovering after their shot. Pharmacy chains across the country, including Albertsons, CVS, Rite-Aid and Walgreens, will also offer extended hours from now until July 4 to make it easier to get vaccinated. The president emphasized that the vaccines will allow Americans to enjoy a summer where they can safely gather with loved ones without fear of the virus. “America is heading into a summer dramatically different from last year’s summer,” Biden said. “A summer of freedom. A summer of joy. A summer of get-togethers and celebrations. An all-American summer that this country deserves after a long, long dark winter that we have all endured.” Biden also noted that Americans are lucky to have such easy access to the vaccines, saying, “All over the world, people are desperate to get a shot that every American can get at their neighborhood drugstore.” Joe Biden emphasized that getting vaccinated is not a “partisan act,” encouraging Americans of all political leanings to get their shots. The president also specifically urged younger Americans to get their vaccines, as their vaccination rates have lagged behind those of older Americans. “We need people under 40 to step up,” Biden said. Joe Biden is now delivering remarks at the White House to outline his administration’s planned efforts over the next month to get more Americans vaccinated against coronavirus. The Biden administration announced this morning that it is launching a “month of action” to encourage Americans to get vaccinated. Among other initiatives, the month of action includes a nationwide tour by Kamala Harris and a partnership with Black-owned barbershops and beauty salons to spread information about vaccines. The president noted that 52% of American adults are now fully vaccinated. He has set a goal of having 70% of American adults at least partially vaccinated by July 4. “It’s clearer than ever — the more people we get vaccinated, the more success we’re going to have in our fight against this virus,” Biden said. Jen Psaki told reporters that at least some of Joe Biden’s afternoon meeting with Republican Senator Shelley Moore Capito to discuss infrastructure negotiations would be one-on-one, without additional staffers present. The White House press secretary’s briefing has now ended, and Biden will soon deliver an update on the country’s vaccine distribution efforts. His administration has already announced a “month of action” to get more Americans vaccinated before July 4. Jen Psaki said that Vice-President Kamala Harris requested to become the Biden administration’s point person on strengthening voting rights in the US. “She actually asked to run point and lead on voting rights,” the White House press secretary said. Joe Biden announced yesterday that Harris would take the lead on voting rights initiatives as congressional Democrats work to advance the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. “I’m asking Vice President Harris to help these efforts and lead them, among her many other responsibilities,” Biden said in Tulsa. “With her leadership and your support, we’re going to overcome again, I promise you. But it’s going to take a hell of a lot of work.” The announcement came as Republican legislators in dozens of states advance bills that would restrict voting access, as the Guardian’s Sam Levine has extensively reported on. Jen Psaki appeared to downplay Joe Biden’s veiled criticism of Democratic senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema in his speech yesterday on the Tulsa race massacre. Commemorating the 100th anniversary of the massacre in Tulsa, the president touched on the hurdles in advancing his legislative agenda because of Democrats’ narrow majorities in both chambers of Congress. “I hear all the folks on TV saying, ‘Why doesn’t Biden get this done?’” the president told the Tulsa crowd. “Well, because Biden only has a majority of, effectively, four votes in the House and a tie in the Senate, with two members of the Senate who vote more with my Republican friends.” The White House press secretary claimed that Biden’s comment was only meant to reflect the difficulty of discussing complex policy negotiations in a television format. “I don’t think he was intending to convey anything other than a little bit of commentary on TV punditry,” Psaki said. Jen Psaki was asked about the ransomware attack on the meat-processing company JBS, which forced its US factories to halt operations. The incident came weeks after another ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline disrupted gasoline supply in several east-coast states. The White House previously said the hackers were most likely a criminal group based in Russia, and Psaki said Joe Biden will discuss recent cyber attacks when he meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin in two weeks. “President Biden certainly thinks Putin and the Russian government have a role to play in stopping these attacks,” Psaki said. The White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, is now holding her daily briefing with reporters. Psaki opened the briefing by reiterating the administration’s announcement that it is launching a “month of action” to get more Americans vaccinated by July 4. The month of action will involve an “all of America sprint” to reach Joe Biden’s goal of having 70% of American adults at least partially vaccinated by July 4, Psaki said. As of today, 63% of American adults have received at least one coronavirus vaccine dose, according to the White House. The Biden administration has announced a new series of initiatives aimed at encouraging more Americans to get vaccinated against coronavirus, as the president looks to have 70% of Americans at least partially vaccinated by July 4. The White House announced that four of largest US childcare providers will offer free childcare for caregivers who are getting the vaccine or recovering after their shot. Pharmacy chains across the country, including Albertsons, CVS, Rite-Aid and Walgreens, will also offer extended hours from now until July 4 to make it easier to get vaccinated. Vice-President Kamala Harris is launching a “nation-wide tour to reach millions of Americans who still need protection against the virus”. “The Vice President’s travel will be anchored in the South, and the First Lady, the Second Gentleman, and members of the Cabinet will also join the Administration’s tour to communities across the country,” the White House said in its factsheet about the new initiatives. The administration is also partnering with Black-owned barbershops and beauty salons to start “Shots at the Shop,” which will allow the businesses to share vaccine information with their customers. “The ‘Shots at the Shop’ initiative will invite participation from across the country, with a particular focus on supporting shops in some of the hardest-hit localities still experiencing significant gaps in vaccination rates,” the White House said. Joe Biden will likely tout all these new developments when he delivers an update on vaccine distribution efforts this afternoon. The Guardian’s Sam Levine reports: Katie Hobbs, Arizona’s top election official who became one of the leading voices beating back conspiracies about the 2020 election, announced Wednesday she was seeking the Democratic nomination for governor in her state. Arizona, where Donald Trump narrowly lost to Joe Biden in November, has become a focal point for conspiracy theorists who falsely believe the election was stolen. After the election, Hobbs beat back baseless claims of fraud and ensured that the state’s presidential electors were certified for Biden to properly reflect the outcome of the popular vote. “We had a job to do, and that job was simple: Count every vote. When you’re under attack, some would have you believe you have two choices: To fight or give in. But there’s a third option: Get the job done,” Hobbs said. “The other side isn’t offering policies to make our lives better. They’re offering conspiracies that only make our lives worse.” In recent months, Hobbs, elected to her office in 2018, has taken on a leading role in monitoring and calling out a GOP-led review of 2.1m ballots cast in Maricopa county, the most populous in Arizona. She has drawn attention to shoddy practices auditors are using and monitors deployed by her office have regularly noted significant problems in procedures. A compilation of notes published by Hobbs’ office on Tuesday, for example, detail security lapses, technological glitches, and confusion about who is in charge. The details revealed by her office have underscore how unprofessional the audit is. Hobbs’ entrance in the governor’s race will likely bring even more attention to who her successor will be. Mark Finchem, an Arizona legislator who is a prominent advocate of the Stop the Steal movement, is already seeking the Republican nomination. House speaker Nancy Pelosi has reportedly told Democrats that multiple options remain to launch an expansive review of the Capitol insurrection, after Senate Republicans killed the bill to form a bipartisan commission to study the attack. NBC News reports: During a conference call with members of the House Democratic Caucus, Pelosi detailed options, including the potential the Senate could vote a second time and try to overcome the Republican filibuster, according to two sources who were on the call. She shot down a suggestion raised by some House Democrats that President Joe Biden could form a presidential commission, calling it not a workable idea, one source on the call said. A presidential commission would need Congress to grant subpoena power and allocate funding. Both chambers would have to vote to approve, which looks unlikely after the Senate Republicans’ filibuster last week. Republicans successfully blocked the commission bill from advancing last week, after only six Republican senators voted with Democrats to start debate on the legislation. Democrats needed 10 Republican votes to overcome the filibuster of the bill. The US secretary of state has warned leaders of Pacific countries about “threats to the rules-based international order” and “economic coercion”, in what appears to be a veiled swipe at China’s growing influence in the region. Antony Blinken was addressing leaders and their delegates from 11 Pacific countries and territories including Fiji, Solomon Islands, Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, French Polynesia, Palau and Marshall Islands as part of the Pacific Islands Conference of Leaders, which is held in Hawaii. Blinken reiterated US support for Pacific island nations as they face the “shared challenges that we have to confront together”, including Covid-19 and the climate crisis. But the main focus of his televised address was China’s growing influence in the region. “Economic coercion across the region is on the rise. The US is all for more development and investment in the islands, but that investment should adhere to international standards for environmentally and socially sustainable development and should be pursued transparently, with public consultation,” he said. “And every country, no matter its size, should always be able to make choices without fear of retribution.” The CDC’s decision to loosen mask requirements has not led to any noticeable increase in the spread of coronavirus, as the number of new cases in the US has continued to fall in the past few weeks. Meanwhile, the number of first-shot vaccine appointments has leveled off in recent weeks after a worrisome decline in the month leading up to the mask announcement. The New York Times explains: First, new Covid cases have continued to decline at virtually the same rate as during the month before the C.D.C. announcement, which came on May 13 ... Overall, daily new cases have fallen by almost 75 percent since mid-April and by more than 90 percent from the peak in January. ... On the other hand, the C.D.C.’s change has had a noticeable effect on behavior in a positive way. ... For the previous month, the number of daily shots in the U.S. had been falling, as the country began to run out of adults who were eager to be vaccinated. With a few days of the mask announcement, the decline leveled off. The White House shared the New York Times piece in an email with reporters, and Joe Biden will likely tout the encouraging trends when he delivers an update on vaccination efforts this afternoon. Donald Trump has shuttered the blog that he started less than a month ago, a senior adviser to the former president said. Jason Miller told CNBC that the page “From the Desk of Donald J. Trump” had been deleted from the former president’s website and “will not be returning”. “It was just auxiliary to the broader efforts we have and are working on,” Miller said in an email to CNBC. “Hoping to have more information on the broader efforts soon, but I do not have a precise awareness of timing.” The blog, which debuted last month, was a clear effort by Trump to amplify his message despite his social media bans, which were put in place after he incited the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol. However, the blog never gained much traction, in part because of readers’ inability to reply to Trump’s statements, as they would do on Twitter or Facebook. Twitter also suspended an account that pulled content from Trump’s blog, @DJTDesk, because the social media company said it violated the platform’s ban evasion policy. Portable microwave weapons capable of causing the mysterious spate of “Havana Syndrome” brain injuries in US diplomats and spies have been developed by several countries in recent years, according to leading American experts in the field. A US company also made the prototype of such a weapon for the marine corps in 2004. The weapon, codenamed Medusa, was intended to be small enough to fit in a car, and cause a “temporarily incapacitating effect” but “with a low probability of fatality or permanent injury”. There is no evidence that the research was taken beyond the prototype phase, and a report on that stage has been removed from a US navy website. Scientists with knowledge of the project said that ethical considerations preventing human experimentation contributed to the project being shelved – but they said such consideration had not hindered US adversaries, including Russia, and possibly China. “The state of that science has for the most part been, if not abandoned, pretty much left fallow in the United States – but it has not been fallow elsewhere,” said James Giordano, professor of neurology and ethics at Georgetown University Medical Center. In case you missed it last night: A Democratic candidate won the special election to fill Interior Secretary Deb Haaland’s open House seat. Democratic state legislator Melanie Stansbury defeated Republican state senator Mark Moores by about 25 points, delivering a resounding victory for Democrats after the party’s poor performance in a Texas special election last month. Delivering a victory speech in Albuquerque, Stansbury said, “This moment is not just about standing up, but about leaning into the moment and bringing fundamental change to our politics and to our country.” Stansbury’s win will help to slightly bolster Democrats’ very narrow majority in the House. Once Stansbury is seated to represent New Mexico’s 1st District, Democrats will have a 220-211 advantage over Republicans. The margin of Stansbury’s victory was also encouraging to Democrats, given that Joe Biden carried the New Mexico district by 23 points in November. Haaland also won reelection to her seat by 16 points last year. Stansbury’s ability to improve upon Biden and Haaland’s numbers gave some Democrats hope that they can hold off a wave of Republican victories in next year’s midterms. However, the midterms are still about a year and a half away, so time will tell. The Guardian’s Sam Levine reports: For nearly five months, Democrats in state legislatures across the country have been scraping to do everything they can to stop an unprecedented onslaught of new voting restrictions from Republicans. They have given searing speeches on the floors of state legislatures. They have supported protests and even gotten arrested demonstrating against the bills. They have filed lawsuits challenging new restrictions almost immediately after they were signed into law. But despite their efforts, Democrats have not been able to stop sweeping new voting restrictions from going into place in states such as Arizona, Georgia, Florida, Iowa and Montana, where Republicans have used their legislative majorities to ram through the bills. But late on Sunday night something different happened in Texas. With Republicans on the verge of passing one of the most restrictive new voting laws in the country, Democrats in the state house of representatives walked out of the legislature, denying Republicans a quorum and killing the legislation. Governor Greg Abbott has fumed over the development and has pledged to call a special session to pass the bill. Be sure to read the fine print on the Anheuser-Busch vaccine giveaway: only 200,000 participants will get money to buy a free round after the US hits Joe Biden’s vaccination goal. And it may be a round for one person, as the beer company is only giving winners a $5.00 virtual debit card to purchase an Anheuser-Busch product. Those who want the chance to win one of the debit cards will also have to create a My Cooler Rewards account and upload a “picture of your favorite place to grab a beer”. Joe Biden will also deliver an update this afternoon on his administration’s efforts to get Americans vaccinated against coronavirus. The speech comes one month before July 4, Biden’s deadline to get 70% of American adults at least partially vaccinated for US Independence Day. The president is expected to announce a new partnership between the White House and the beer company Anheuser-Busch to encourage Americans to get their vaccines. The CEO of Anheuser-Busch said in an announcement this morning that the company will “buy Americans 21+ a round of beer when we reach the White House goal”. “We pride ourselves on stepping up both in times of need and in times of great celebration, and the past year has been no different,” said CEO Michel Doukeris. “As we look ahead to brighter days with renewed optimism, we are proud to work alongside the White House to make a meaningful impact for our country, our communities and our consumers.” The “Let’s Grab A Beer” initiative is only the latest in a string of US efforts to incentivize vaccinations. Perhaps most notably, the state of Ohio has been distributing $1 million lottery prizes to a handful of new vaccine recipients. Greetings from Washington, live blog readers. Joe Biden will meet this afternoon with Shelley Moore Capito, the senator who has been leading the Republican team negotiating with the White House over a potential infrastructure bill. The meeting comes almost one week after Capito and her fellow Republicans introduced their latest counteroffer, which proposed spending $928 billion for infrastructure projects over the next eight years. That offer was still a far cry from what Biden has called for spending. Of the $928 billion in Republicans’ plan, only $257 billion is considered new money, while the rest was baselines spending, meaning the funds that were already going to be used on infrastructure projects over the next eight years because of existing policies. In contrast, the president has proposed investing $1.7 trillion over baseline infrastructure spending, which is still less than the $2.25 trillion that he originally called for. So Democrats and Republicans remain miles apart on infrastructure, and Biden has signaled that he is ready for the negotiations to come to a close. “I told [Capito] we have to finish this really soon,” Biden said last Thursday. “We’re going to have to close this down soon.” The blog will have more details on the meeting coming up, so stay tuned.","charCount":"42053","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/maanvi-singh\">Maanvi Singh</a>  and <a href=\"profile/joan-greve\">Joan E Greve</a> in Washington"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2021/jun/02/texas-valedictorian-graduation-speech-abortion-ban","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-03T00:48:51Z","webTitle":"Texas valedictorian goes off-script to slam abortion ban: ‘it’s dehumanizing’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jun/02/texas-valedictorian-graduation-speech-abortion-ban","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2021/jun/02/texas-valedictorian-graduation-speech-abortion-ban","fields":{"headline":"Texas valedictorian goes off-script to slam abortion ban: ‘it’s dehumanizing’","standfirst":"<p>PaxtonSmith criticized the near-total ban on abortions signed into the state’s law in May, which makes no exception for rape or incest</p>","trailText":"PaxtonSmith criticized the near-total ban on abortions signed into the state’s law in May, which makes no exception for rape or incest","byline":"Maanvi Singh","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cd8a6aca37e48b95113787b1688c99925a1c0bc0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd8a6aca37e48b95113787b1688c99925a1c0bc0/0_95_5171_3103/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thousands of protesters rally outside the Texas state capitol on 29 May after a new bill outlawing abortions was signed.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thousands of protesters rally outside the Texas state capitol on 29 May after a new bill outlawing abortions was signed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sergio Flores/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>The valedictorian at a Texas high school went off-script while delivering her graduation speech, criticising the state’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/19/texas-abortion-ban-law-greg-abbott\">extreme abortion ban</a> in an address that has since been widely shared on social media.</p> <p>School administrators had signed off on Paxton Smith’s pre-written speech on how TV and media have shaped her worldview.

Agency (EMA) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/28/covid-german-children-12-16-pfizer-vaccine-next-month\">approved the use of Biontech/Pfizer in children aged 12 to 15 on Friday</a>, and the government has also given the green light for its use from 7 June, the standing committee on vaccination, Stiko, which reports to the ministry of health, has still to make its recommendation.</p> \n  <p>The chair of Stiko, Thomas Mertens, has urged people to be patient, telling a <a href=\"https://www.ndr.de/nachrichten/info/podcast4684.html\">weekly podcast </a>dedicated to coronavirus developments, now on its 91st episode, that the vaccine is “no liquorice sweet” but a medical intervention.</p> \n  <p>“The decision as to whether Stiko recommends that all children between the ages of 12 and 16 be vaccinated against coronavirus must be based only on the best available evidence basis,” he said. </p> \n  <p>He stressed however, that Stiko would recommend the use of the vaccine on children with pre-existing conditions. </p> \n  <p>Mertens said the data provided by the vaccine makers resulting from their clinical studies of the mRNA vaccine were so far insufficient to recommend its use on all children. </p> \n  <p>“The number of vaccinated children in the study is simply too small in order to be able to make a reliable statement about its safety in this age group.” </p> \n  <p>Out of 1,100 children who took part in the study, about 14 of them suffered a severe reaction. </p> \n  <p>Mertens said other factors had to be taken into account when deciding whether to recommend the jab, such as a child’s risk of getting sick without a vaccine, as well as the question of herd immunity in the wider population. </p> \n  <p>Mertens said the decision was not an easy one, despite the millions of children who have already been vaccinated in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news\">US</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel\">Israel</a>. </p> \n  <p>“It’s not like offering the children a liquorice sweet,” he said. “This is a medical intervention”. </p> \n  <p>He added it

<div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/germany\">Germany</a> </strong>is slowly beginning to open up again with the government’s disease control agency, the Robert Koch Institute confirming that a third wave of the virus has been broken, and the number of new infections is lower than at any time since the autumn.</p> \n  <p>Almost a fifth of all Germans have now been fully vaccinated, and about 900,000 to 1m jabs are being administered every day.</p> \n  <p>But caution is being urged as virologists say until 70% of the population have received two jabs, the situation remains fragile.</p> \n  <p>Among the much-awaited restriction easing measures taking place in Berlin from Friday are the reopening of gyms and swimming pools as well as restaurants and bars, though establishments with service both inside and out will have to demand a negative result from customers if they wish to open both areas.</p> \n  <p>The obligation to make an appointment before going shopping, so-called “<em tabindex=\"-1\">Termin Shopping</em>”, will be dropped, though mask wearing will remain the rule, including on public transport.</p> \n  <p>Despite the fact that 500 people are now allowed to meet for cultural or sporting events in the open air, 100 inside, Stephan Hengst from the Berlin Music Commission has criticised the suddenness of the announcement, saying club operators and musicians have been given little notice to be able to organise events.</p> \n  <p>Companies must continue to allow their employees to work from home wherever possible which the German Trade Union Association, DGB, has insisted is necessary. </p> \n  <p>“As long as a majority of the population is not fully vaccinated, employers must not be allowed to shirk from their responsibilities,” the DGB’s head, Reiner Hoffmann, said.</p> \n  <p>But the head of the German Association of Employers (BDA), Steffen Kampeter, has insisted companies and employees should be relied upon to make the right decision as to whether they should return or not, with regular testing and the option to continue in home office necessary measures to help manage the coming weeks and months.</p> \n  <p>From Monday, about 6,000 company doctors are expected to boost the vaccine campaign when group prioritisation rules are lifted. </p> \n  <p>Having received an initial contingent of 700,000 doses, they have said they expect to be able to carry out around 5m vaccinations every month.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time

We’ll be back in a few hours. In the meantime, you can catch up with all our pandemic coverage here. Antibiotic use was “very high” among Covid-19 hospital patients in the UK during the first wave of the pandemic even though confirmed bacterial infections were rare, scientists have found. Antibiotics are medicines used to treat some types of bacterial infections and do not work on viral diseases, such as Covid-19. New analysis, published in the journal The Lancet Microbe, shows that, between February 6 and June 8 2020, 85% of coronavirus patients received one or more antibiotics during their hospital stay, while 37% were prescribed the drugs prior to admission. It suggests many ill Covid-19 patients who did not have a bacterial infection were being unnecessarily treated with medicines that kill bacteria. The scientists say that giving antibiotics to Covid-19 patients who do not have a bacterial co-infection risks worsening global antimicrobial resistance - which occurs when bacteria no longer respond to the drugs made to kill them. They recommend that antibiotic use should be more evidence-based (known as antimicrobial stewardship), while adding that medics should restrict prescribing these drugs unless tests confirm a bacterial infection, PA reports. US secretary of state Antony Blinken said president Joe Biden could announce this week Washington’s plan for distributing 80 million coronavirus vaccines globally, Reuters reports. “I want you to know as well that in a few short days ... possibly as early as tomorrow, the president is going to announce in more detail, the plan that he’s put together to push out 80 million vaccines, around the world,” said Blinken at a gathering at the U.S. Embassy in Costa Rica. Authorities in Australia have released a list of public exposure sites in New South Wales visited by a confirmed case of Covid-19. Here are the current coronavirus hotspots, Covid exposure sites, venues and case location alerts and what to do if you’ve visited them. The new White House science adviser wants to have a vaccine ready to fight the next pandemic in about 100 days after recognising a potential viral outbreak. Eric Lander told The Associated Press: “This is a moment in so many ways, not just health, that we can rethink fundamental assumptions about what’s possible and that’s true of climate and energy and many areas.” Brazil registered 2,507 Covid-19 deaths on Wednesday and 95,601 additional cases, according to data released by the country’s health ministry. The South American country has now registered 467,706 total coronavirus deaths and 16,720,081 confirmed cases, Reuters reports. Amazon is testing its front-line staff in Britain for coronavirus variants and feeding the data to public health officials, including in hotspots where a strain first found in India is spreading fast, Reuters reports. The retail giant opened Covid-19 testing labs in the UK and the US last year to provide voluntary testing for staff and can now also test for variants in Britain, where scientists have pioneered sequencing coronavirus genomes. Luke Meredith, director of the Amazon Diagnostic Laboratory in Britain, said the company was open to offering the same service in the US and did not rule out making its testing programme available to the UK public. “It’s very important that we acknowledge the fact that variants can transmit in different ways, they have different responses to vaccines, they may have different impacts on people’s health,” he told Reuters. “This is a learning phase.” The UK’s vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi, pressed about the dropping of restrictions on June 21, told ITV’s Peston programme: “At the moment there’s nothing in the data to suggest that we need to move the road map. “We’ve been straight with people, as both the Prime Minister and the Health Secretary have said, on June 14 we will share with the nation all the data that we’d have gathered. “The next 12 days are going to be really important to see what the virus is doing. We’ve got a very large-scale surveillance infrastructure in place in terms of waste water surveillance and large-scale testing.” On giving vaccines to children, Zahawi said: “Some children do get serious Covid and long Covid, but on the whole you’ll be vaccinating to protect families, the community and public health.” Romania has started administering Covid-19 vaccines to young teenagers aged 12 to 15, after the European Medicines Agency approved use of the Pfizer jab last week for that age group in the 27-nation European Union Associated Press reports: National vaccination committee chief Valeriu Gheorghita said more than 2,100 appointments were made for children in the past 24 hours via the online national booking platform. Vaccination centres will also accept no-appointment walk-ins, he said, speaking at the inauguration of a children’s vaccination centre in the capital, Bucharest. “By authorising the vaccination of those between 12 to 15 years old, we bring an important advantage especially for kids with chronic diseases or other conditions which make them vulnerable to serious illness,” Gheorghita said. Sir Kevan Collins has quit as the education catch-up tsar over his fears the UK government’s 1.4 billion fund to help children recover missed lessons “falls far short of what is needed”. It has been reported that he called for 15 billion of funding and 100 extra hours of teaching per pupil, rather than the 1.4 billion additional fund announced by the government. In his letter to the prime minister, Sir Kevan, who has resigned after just four months of being the education recovery commissioner, states: “One conservative estimate puts the long-term economic cost of lost learning in England due to the pandemic at 100 billion, with the average pupil having missed 115 days in school. “In parts of the country where schools were closed for longer, such as the North, the impact of low skills on productivity is likely to be particularly severe.” He warns the current package of support is “too narrow, too small and will be delivered too slowly” and the pandemic has already wreaked the greatest damage to children from disadvantaged backgrounds. An announcement from the US president: Argentina’s largest oil workers union said on Wednesday that it would call a strike if the government does not allow it to privately purchase Covid-19 vaccines amid a second wave of infections, Reuters reports. The Rio Negro, Neuquen and La Pampa Private Oil and Gas Union, representing 24,000 workers, many of them in the Vaca Muerta shale oil formation, said it would wait for government authorization until the end of next week. If permission to purchase vaccines is not granted, it said it would call a strike. “Next Friday the 11th, if there are no answers to our request, we are going to withdraw from our jobs to protect the health of all our colleagues,” the union’s leader, Guillermo Pereyra, said. France will start vaccinating teenagers from age 12 with the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine on June 15, the government said. Mexico reported 3,269 new cases of Covid-19 in the country and 306 more fatalities, Reuters reports. It brings the total to 2,423,928 infections and 228,146 deaths, according to health ministry data released on Wednesday. Spanish regions with a low Covid infection rate will be allowed to reopen nightlife before herd immunity is achieved, which is expected by mid-August, the health minister said. The Canadian province of Ontario will keep schools closed for in-person learning until the new school year starts in September, premier Doug Ford announced. Germany plans to pay vaccine manufacturers an annual reservation fee to build up reserve capacity of around 600-700m doses per year to help it fight future pandemics, the health minister said. Colombia has began what its government called a gradual opening of its border with Venezuela after a 14-month closure intended to curb the spread of the coronavirus. In Germany, the Robert Koch Institute has confirmed that a third wave of the virus has been broken. EU governments have agreed to add Japan to their small list of countries from which they will allow non-essential travel, it was reported earlier. France will start vaccinating teenagers from age 12 with the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine on June 15, the government said. France, which began vaccinations late last year with priority given to care home residents, has gradually been widening eligibility by lowering age thresholds and removing conditions such as profession or state of health. From May 31, Covid-19 vaccines were made available to everyone over 18. President Emmanuel Macron told reporters earlier on Wednesday that from June 15, young people aged 12 to 18 will be allowed to get a Covid-19 vaccine from June 15. AstraZeneca Plc is in talks with the US government to shift production of its Covid-19 vaccine from a Baltimore plant to a factory owned by Catalent Inc , the New York Times reported. AstraZeneca has been on the lookout for an alternative production site after the US government stopped it from making use of the Baltimore plant owned by Emergent BioSolutions Inc after workers accidentally contaminated a batch of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s vaccine. The British drugmaker’s vaccine has not been approved in the US. Countries and private donors have pledged nearly $2.4 billion to the COVAX vaccine-sharing plan, intended to make vaccines more available to people in poorer nations, Reuters reports. The announcements, ranging from $2,500 from island nation Mauritius to millions of dollars and doses from wealthier countries, came during a video summit hosted by Japan and the GAVI Vaccine Alliance, which leads the COVAX facility alongside the World Health Organization. Australian prime minister Scott Morrison said his country was giving a further A$50 million ($39 million) to COVAX. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation later announced a $50 million commitment to COVAX. Mexico reported 3,269 new cases of Covid-19 in the country and 306 more fatalities, Reuters reports. It brings the total to 2,423,928 infections and 228,146 deaths, according to health ministry data released on Wednesday. Separate government data recently published suggests the actual death toll is at least 60% above the confirmed figure. Here is a quick recap of all the main Covid updates from around the world: Spanish regions with a low Covid infection rate will be allowed to reopen nightlife before herd immunity is achieved, which is expected by mid-August, the health minister said. The Canadian province of Ontario will keep schools closed for in-person learning until the new school year starts in September, premier Doug Ford announced. Germany plans to pay vaccine manufacturers an annual reservation fee to build up reserve capacity of around 600-700m doses per year to help it fight future pandemics, the health minister said. Colombia has began what its government called a gradual opening of its border with Venezuela after a 14-month closure intended to curb the spread of the coronavirus. In Germany, the Robert Koch Institute has confirmed that a third wave of the virus has been broken. EU governments have agreed to add Japan to their small list of countries from which they will allow non-essential travel, it was reported earlier. Spanish regions with a low Covid-19 infection rate will be allowed to reopen nightlife before herd immunity is achieved, which is expected by mid-August, the health minister has said. Regions with a 14-day notification rate of infections below 50 cases per 100,000 people will be able to open discos and clubs until 3 am, although some restrictions will continue, Reuters reports. It was not clear whether dance floors will be allowed and the party group - a maximum of six people inside - has to remain masked, according to local media. “A gradual and progressive return to normality is needed. Lessons must be learned”, the health minister, Carolina Darias, told journalists. Health standards are in the hands of the regions in Spain, although according to the minister, this agreement is binding. Madrid, where bars and restaurants are already open until 1am despite being one of the top five regions with the highest infection rates, rejects the criteria and wants more flexibility. Spain’s overall infection rate fell to 118.5 cases per 100,000 on Wednesday, nearly halving since the end of April, but only the Balearic islands, Valencia and the North African enclave of Ceuta meet the sub-50 requirement. The US had administered 296,912,892 doses of Covid vaccines in the country as of Wednesday morning and distributed 366,977,535 doses, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Those figures are up from the 296,404,240 vaccine doses the CDC said had been administered by 1 June out of 366,317,045 doses delivered, Reuters reports. In France, the number of new Covid cases held below 10,000 for the second day in a row on Wednesday, as pressure on hospitals eased further and the daily death toll dropped sharply from last week. Reuters reports: The number of new infections is usually well below 10,000 on Mondays or the day after a public holiday, due to data reporting lags. But on Wednesday, the health ministry reported 8,743 new cases, down from 9,848 on Tuesday and the first time since September that new cases were below 10,000 two days running. On Monday, there were just 1,211 new cases, the lowest level for a Monday since mid-August. The ministry also reported that the number of people in intensive care units with Covid-19 fell by 71 to 2,754, getting closer to the 2021 low of 2,582 set on 7 January, and down from a 2021 high of 6,001 at the end of April. The Canadian province of Ontario will keep schools closed for in-person learning until the new school year starts in September, premier Doug Ford has announced. Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, took schools back to online learning in April as the third Covid wave threatened to overwhelm hospital and healthcare systems. The decision to keep schools closed “was a hard choice to make, but I will not - and I repeat, I will not - take unnecessary risks with our children right now,” Ford said, citing the increased danger posed by variants to younger people. But Ford also said that the province could begin its planned three-step reopening plan sooner, if the chief medical officer gave his blessing, Reuters reports. The province announced in May that it would start slowly reopening restaurants and retail during the week of 14 June if certain vaccination targets were met. Facing questions of whether he was choosing the economy over schools, Ford said not enough teachers and students were vaccinated to make reopening schools safe. In Australia, Melbourne GPs say they are being forced to turn away huge numbers of vaccine-seeking locals, including busloads of vulnerable residents from care facilities, because the commonwealth’s supply of doses has not increased to match the explosion in demand. The latest outbreak has caused a huge increase in demand for the Covid-19 vaccine in Victoria, and the state is now recording daily vaccination numbers of above 20,000, up from the roughly 2,600 doses administered on 24 May. The demand has inundated local GPs, who say their supplies of vaccine doses are evaporating almost immediately. My colleague Christopher Knaus has the full story here: Canada’s chief medical officers have said the country should seek to administer second Covid vaccine doses as soon as possible as inoculation supply rises and variants spread, according to a statement. As Reuters reports, Canada delayed second doses for up to 16 weeks as it pushed to get first shots into peoples’ arms. Now almost 60% of adults have received a first dose, while less than 6% are fully vaccinated. In a joint statement, the chief medical officers from each province and territory: Given Canada’s current and projected vaccine supply, second doses should be offered as soon as possible, with priority given to those at highest risk of severe illness and death from Covid-19. Urban crime ranging from vehicle theft and burglary to robbery and assault fell substantially during Covid lockdowns as stay-at-home orders around the world cleared the streets and ensured more houses were occupied in the daytime. An analysis of crime reports from 27 cities in Europe, Asia and the Americas found overall urban crime fell by more than a third while lockdowns were in place and then steadily climbed back up when restrictions were lifted. Robberies fell on average by 46%, and vehicle theft and daily assaults were down 39% and 35% respectively. Burglaries dropped by 28% overall, while more minor crimes such as pickpocketing and shoplifting fell by about 47% across the countries studied. Manuel Eisner, a professor of criminology at the University of Cambridge, said the declines were sharp but short-lived, with the lowest crime rates reported two to five weeks after lockdowns came into force. “After that, the figures start to creep up again,” he said. Ian Sample, the Guardian’s science editor, has the latest here: Argentina will begin to produce the Sputnik V Covid vaccine locally after test batches from the South American country passed quality tests conducted by Russia’s Gamaleya Institute, the health minister Carla Vizzotti has said. In April, Argentine firm Laboratorios Richmond produced test batches of the vaccine, with plans to scale up once Russia had carried out quality inspections. Vizzotti told reporters: The Gamaleya Institute has confirmed the quality control of three consecutive batches of component one and three consecutive batches of component two. Yesterday, we were informed that the quality control was satisfactory and that we are going to advance in the import of antigens of component 1 and 2 so that Argentina is part of the Sputnik V vaccine production chain. The announcement comes as Argentina battles a harsh second wave of infections. The virus has left 78,733 dead and 3.8m infected in Argentina since the start of the pandemic last year, Reuters reports. The EU has delayed putting the UK on a “white list” of countries from where non-essential travel into the bloc is approved because of concerns about the rise in cases linked to the Delta variant first identified in India. Japan, which is in an extended state of emergency during which it has enjoyed a sustained reduction in infection cases, has been added to the list, diplomatic sources said. The country is due to host the Olympic Games on 23 July. The decision in principle was made during a meeting of ambassadors in Brussels on Wednesday. Sources said the UK’s status would be examined again on 14 June. Daniel Boffey, the Guardian’s Brussels bureau chief, has the full story here: Lack of effective political leadership has hampered efforts to stop the Covid-19 pandemic in Latin America, where infections are dangerously on the rise again, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) said. While the United States, Canada, and Mexico are reporting overall reductions in Covid-19 cases and deaths, new infections are increasing in the rest of the Americas, PAHO Director Carissa Etienne said. Colombia is reporting the highest rate of infections in South America, where new cases have nearly tripled in some regions, and Brazil is seeing a rise in new infections and hospitalizations, she said. But without effective leadership, Latin American countries are failing in their response to the illness. “Sadly, across our region, we’ve seen misinformation about Covid-19 sow doubt on proven health measures, often in the context of political disputes,” Etienne said in a briefing. “By stoking controversy where there is none, our leaders are sending mixed messages to the public and standing in the way of effective measures to control the virus,” she said. Of greatest concern now is Haiti, where despite sharp increases in cases, hospitalisations, and deaths, public health measures required to stop transmission are being largely ignored by the population, Etienne said. Britain is in talks with AstraZeneca for additional doses of its Covid-19 vaccine that will have been modified to better target the Beta coronavirus variant first identified in South Africa, health minister Matt Hancock said. Britain has previously secured 100 million doses of the vaccine, developed at the University of Oxford and licensed to AstraZeneca. “We’ve started commercial negotiations with AstraZeneca to secure a variant vaccine: future supplies of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine that have been adapted to tackle the B.1.351 variant first identified in South Africa,” Hancock said in a speech at the university. Italy has reported 62 coronavirus deaths and 2,897 cases, according to the latest data. The United States, Canada, and Mexico are reporting overall reductions in Covid-19 cases and deaths, though overall new infections are on the rise again in the rest of the Americas, the head of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), Carissa Etienne, said. Colombia is reporting the highest rate of infections in South America, where new cases have nearly tripled in some regions, and Brazil is seeing a rise in new infections and hospitalizations. Despite sharp increases in cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in Haiti, public health measures required to stop transmission there are being largely ignored by the population, Etienne warned. Britain reported a further 4,330 cases of coronavirus and 12 more deaths within 28 days of a positive test, according to official data. The total number of people to have received the first dose of a vaccine stood at 39,585,665, the figures showed. Japan’s prime minister announced Wednesday an additional $800m contribution to the U.N.-backed initiative to provide COVID-19 vaccines to poor countries, a four-fold increase of Japanese funding for the COVAX program. The pledge by prime minister Yoshihide Suga comes as his government attempts to accelerate vaccinations in Japan, one of the world’s least inoculated countries, only about 50 days before it hosts the Olympics amid a continuing surge in infections. He spoke as Japan co-sponsored a fundraising event for COVAX with Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which helps run the program. The program managers are seeking about $2bn more to reach a target of $8.3bn for its effort to fund free vaccines for low- and middle-income countries around the world. Global airline body IATA increased pressure on governments to ease travel restrictions on Wednesday, pointing to UK testing data that showed low incidence of Covid-19 in arriving passengers, Reuters reports. “These data tell us we can do better,” IATA Director General Willie Walsh said, citing a 2.2% positive rate among 365,895 tests carried out in February-May, according to the NHS figures. Germany plans to pay vaccine manufacturers an annual reservation fee to build up reserve capacity of around 600-700m doses per year to help it fight future pandemics, health minister Jens Spahn has said. The government plans to launch a call for tenders for so-called pandemic preparedness contracts with a five-year term so that vaccine doses “can be activated quickly if the worst comes to the worst,” Spahn told a news conference. Manufacturing setbacks and an over-reliance on EU approval for supplies slowed Germany’s rollout of Covid vaccines. It wants to boost domestic production to ensure it is not deprived of shots in future pandemics, Reuters reports. The stand-by contracts will help maintain know-how acquired during the pandemic so that next time “we don’t have to ramp up production from zero to 100,” Christoph Krupp, head of the vaccine production task force told reporters. “We want to bet on several companies and several vaccine types and not just one,” Krupp added. Reuters reports: Colombia on Wednesday began what its government called a gradual opening of its border with Venezuela after a 14-month closure intended to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Colombia, whose porous border with Venezuela extends roughly 1,380 miles (2,220km), has been the chief destination for Venezuelans fleeing their country’s social and economic crisis. The two countries do not maintain diplomatic relations. The gradual opening of river and land crossings was authorised starting at midnight on Wednesday, according to a resolution published by the Andean nation’s interior ministry. The interior ministry said biosecurity measures in light of the Covid-19 pandemic established by Colombia’s health ministry must be followed during crossings. Colombia closed its borders in March 2020. Rodrigo Duterte, president of the Philippines, has appealed to the public to get vaccinated against Covid-19, after data showed the government was far behind its immunisation targets, Reuters reports. In a televised address, Duterte said: I invite all our countrymen to be vaccinated at the earliest possible opportunity because this is the most, if not the only way, effective way, to defeat the Covid-19 pandemic. Let us all keep in mind that the vaccine will not only protect you from the virus, it will also protect your loved ones, especially the sick and elderly. John Wong, a data analyst on the government’s Covid taskforce, said that in the three months since early inoculations started, just 14% of senior citizens and 8% of people with health conditions had received first doses of a vaccine, short of the 21% target. Wong attributed the slow rollout to limited vaccine supplies, vaccine hesitancy and accessibility problems. As Reuters reports, the chairman of the Gavi vaccine alliance, Jose Manuel Barroso, has said that a pledging summit secured nearly $2.4bn, bringing total contributions nearly to $9.6bn for the Covax dose-sharing programme to buy vaccines and deliver them to poorer nations (see earlier post). Egypt aims to vaccinate 40% of its population against Covid-19 by the end of this year, the prime minister said in a televised address. By the end of Wednesday, 2.5 million people will have been vaccinated from a total of 6 million who signed up on the government’s registration platform, Reuters reported Mostafa Madbouly as saying. The first batch of locally made vaccines will be ready in July, Madbouly added. A debate over whether children in Germany should be vaccinated is showing no signs of letting up. Whilst the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved the use of Biontech/Pfizer in children aged 12 to 15 on Friday, and the government has also given the green light for its use from 7 June, the standing committee on vaccination, Stiko, which reports to the ministry of health, has still to make its recommendation. The chair of Stiko, Thomas Mertens, has urged people to be patient, telling a weekly podcast dedicated to coronavirus developments, now on its 91st episode, that the vaccine is “no liquorice sweet” but a medical intervention. “The decision as to whether Stiko recommends that all children between the ages of 12 and 16 be vaccinated against coronavirus must be based only on the best available evidence basis,” he said. He stressed however, that Stiko would recommend the use of the vaccine on children with pre-existing conditions. Mertens said the data provided by the vaccine makers resulting from their clinical studies of the mRNA vaccine were so far insufficient to recommend its use on all children. “The number of vaccinated children in the study is simply too small in order to be able to make a reliable statement about its safety in this age group.” Out of 1,100 children who took part in the study, about 14 of them suffered a severe reaction. Mertens said other factors had to be taken into account when deciding whether to recommend the jab, such as a child’s risk of getting sick without a vaccine, as well as the question of herd immunity in the wider population. Mertens said the decision was not an easy one, despite the millions of children who have already been vaccinated in the US and Israel. “It’s not like offering the children a liquorice sweet,” he said. “This is a medical intervention”. He added it was extremely rare for children to have a severe bout of coronavirus and that also had to be part of the equation. The European budget airline Wizz Air plunged to a €576m annual loss as it warned 2021 would be a “transition year” with further losses to come until travel restrictions are fully lifted. The carrier’s revenue slumped by 73% in the 12 months to the end of March, the period covering the first year of Covid-19, and it carried 10m passengers, a 75% fall compared with a year earlier. The airline said it had carried more than 830,000 passengers in May, while its planes were two-thirds full. József Váradi, the chief executive, said: We expect [this] to be a transition year where we will experience a slow but gradual recovery, mostly subject to the pace of vaccinations globally including in Europe. You can read the latest by my colleague Joanna Partridge here: Australia and European countries have announced fresh contributions to the Covax doses-sharing mechanism, in an attempt to widen vaccination of people in low and middle income countries. Australian prime minister Scott Morrison said that his country was making a further $50m donation to the Gavi vaccine alliance’s Covax facility, bringing its total to $130m. Pedro Sánchez, Spain’s prime minister, who announced a donation of 15m doses and $61m, said: “Only by leading by example we will be effective in preaching solidarity.” Sweden, Austria and Luxembourg were among other countries to also announce new donations, Reuters notes. Germany is slowly beginning to open up again with the government’s disease control agency, the Robert Koch Institute confirming that a third wave of the virus has been broken, and the number of new infections is lower than at any time since the autumn. Almost a fifth of all Germans have now been fully vaccinated, and about 900,000 to 1m jabs are being administered every day. But caution is being urged as virologists say until 70% of the population have received two jabs, the situation remains fragile. Among the much-awaited restriction easing measures taking place in Berlin from Friday are the reopening of gyms and swimming pools as well as restaurants and bars, though establishments with service both inside and out will have to demand a negative result from customers if they wish to open both areas. The obligation to make an appointment before going shopping, so-called “Termin Shopping”, will be dropped, though mask wearing will remain the rule, including on public transport. Despite the fact that 500 people are now allowed to meet for cultural or sporting events in the open air, 100 inside, Stephan Hengst from the Berlin Music Commission has criticised the suddenness of the announcement, saying club operators and musicians have been given little notice to be able to organise events. Companies must continue to allow their employees to work from home wherever possible which the German Trade Union Association, DGB, has insisted is necessary. “As long as a majority of the population is not fully vaccinated, employers must not be allowed to shirk from their responsibilities,” the DGB’s head, Reiner Hoffmann, said. But the head of the German Association of Employers (BDA), Steffen Kampeter, has insisted companies and employees should be relied upon to make the right decision as to whether they should return or not, with regular testing and the option to continue in home office necessary measures to help manage the coming weeks and months. From Monday, about 6,000 company doctors are expected to boost the vaccine campaign when group prioritisation rules are lifted. Having received an initial contingent of 700,000 doses, they have said they expect to be able to carry out around 5m vaccinations every month. EU governments have agreed to add Japan to their small list of countries from which they will allow non-essential travel, while holding off until at least mid-June for British tourists, EU sources have confirmed. Reuters reports: Ambassadors from the EU’s 27 countries approved the addition of Japan at a meeting on Wednesday, with the change to take effect in the coming days. EU countries are recommended gradually to lift travel restrictions for the current seven countries on the list- Australia, Israel, New Zealand, Rwanda, Singapore, South Korea and Thailand. Individual EU countries can still opt to demand a negative Covid-19 test or a period of quarantine. The EU last month eased criteria for adding new countries to the list, by changing to 75 from 25 the maximum number of new Covid-19 cases per 100,000 people in the previous 14 days. Britain met that revised target but was left off the list because of an increase in Covid-19 cases arising from an infectious coronavirus variant first identified in India. South Australian health authorities have warned AFL fans not to touch the ball if it flies into the crowd during Adelaide’s home game against Collingwood, sparking puns about possible “airborne transmission” of Covid. The Melbourne-based Magpies have been granted a special exemption to travel to South Australia for Saturday’s twilight clash with the Crows at Adelaide Oval, which has been operating with full-capacity crowds since early May. South Australia’s chief public health officer, Prof Nicola Spurrier, on Wednesday defended the decision to allow the team to visit despite the border being closed to Victoria amid the state’s growing Covid-19 cluster. Spurrier described the exemption as a “special situation”, saying the risk was “negligible” because the team was already in quarantine at home in Melbourne along with their families or housemates.

Its director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesuis, is speaking at the Gavi Covax summit. Vietnam’s health minister has said that Russia has agreed to provide it with 20m doses of its Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine this year, Reuters reports. The south-east Asian country approved the Russian vaccine in March but has stepped up its procurement push after being hit by its biggest outbreak so far, although its overall cases and fatality numbers remain relatively low. “Vietnam is trying to get access to Covid-19 vaccine sources to speed up its vaccination rollout at the earliest,” health minister Nguyen Thanh Long said in a statement announcing the Sputnik V agreement. At least 220 million people globally are expected to remain unemployed this year, well above pre-pandemic levels, with a weak labour market recovery exacerbating existing inequalities, the International Labour Organization (ILO) has said. The UN agency forecast the outlook improving to 205 million unemployed next year – still well above the 187 million recorded in 2019 before the onset of the pandemic, Reuters reports. According to ILO models, that equates to a global unemployment rate of 6.3% this year, falling to 5.7% next year but still up on the pre-pandemic rate of 5.4% in 2019. In a report, World Employment and Social Outlook: Trends 2021, the ILO said: Employment growth will be insufficient to make up for the losses suffered until at least 2023.

Checkpoints between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides of Cyprus are to reopen on Friday, the United Nations has said, marking the first time restrictions have been eased since December 2020 because of the pandemic. Cyprus is split between its Greek and Turkish Cypriot populations, with a number of designated checkpoints controlling movements between the north and south of the island. “The reopening of all crossing points will facilitate free movement, promote people to people contacts, build trust and have an overall positive socio-economic impact across the island for the benefit of all Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots,” the United Nations mission on Cyprus, UNFICYP, said in a statement. Reuters report that a committee of health experts from both sides would be assessing the situation on a bi-weekly basis. Vehicle and pedestrian crossings have been subject to on-and-off closures since February 2020, when the Greek Cypriot side shut the checkpoints for the first time in decades as a precaution to quell the spread of the virus. Under present circumstances, people who cross will require a seven-day negative antigen test or PCR test, the peacekeeping mission said. Rural northern California is seeing a troubling rise in Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations, an alarming trend that comes as residents and businesses continue to protest against safety measures and vaccinations – with one Mendocino cafe threatening to charge customers $5 for wearing a mask. While the region makes up a small proportion of the state’s population, the growth in its caseload has been considerable, and comes at a time when the state overall is enjoying some of the lowest rates of Covid in the country. After largely avoiding the worst of the pandemic, a block of far northern California counties now leads the state with nearly 40 cases per 100,000 residents over the past week, according to statistics maintained by the Los Angeles Times. Tehama county ranked the highest in the LA Times case ratings with 139 cases per 100,000 residents. Meanwhile 10 of the 21 total Covid deaths in nearby Siskiyou county have occurred since the beginning of May. The region has long been one of the most forceful in its pushback against measures such as masks, business restrictions and vaccine mandates – and the protests have only continued to gain steam. A cafe in the town of Mendocino made headlines after announcing it will charge customers a $5 fee if they order while wearing a mask. It also threatened to charge $5 to anyone “caught bragging about your vaccine”. “It’s about time the proponents of these ineffective government measures start paying for the collateral damage they have collectively caused,” the cafe owner Chris Castleman told NBC News. He also offered a 50% discount to customers who threw their masks in the trash. George Rutherford, a professor of epidemiology at the University of California, San Francisco, said the current situation feels inevitable. “I was waiting for this to happen,” he said, adding that the outbreaks mirror trends occurring in southern and eastern Oregon, just north of California’s border. “It shows you where vaccination is lagging and transmission is taking place.” Read more of Erin McCormick’s report from Berkeley: ‘Waiting to happen’: the California region where masks are taboo - and cases are rising The World Health Organization has approved the Sinovac Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use – the second Chinese vaccine to receive the WHO’s green light. The WHO said the emergency use listing gives countries, funders, procuring agencies and communities assurance that the vaccine has met international standards. Last month Sinopharm became the first Chinese vaccine to be approved by the WHO. The GAVI vaccine alliance is in talks with Sinovac to expand the Covax dose-sharing portfolio available to poor countries following the WHO approval. India has reported 132,788 new cases over the past 24 hours, and an additional 3,207 deaths. China has reported 24 new cases, including 10 domestic cases all in Guangdong province where authorities have imposed localised lockdown measures to control an outbreak. International flights to Vietnam’s two biggest cities are to resume, reversing a short-lived ban imposed over fears of a new coronavirus wave. AstraZeneca has said it would soon provide Thailand with 1.8m doses of locally manufactured Covid-19 vaccine, the first of multiple batches this month, just days out from the launch of its mass vaccination drive. Germany’s top diplomat in Taipei has said his government has been helping in talks between Taiwan and drugmaker BioNTech to supply Covid-19 vaccines, after Taiwan said a deal fell apart earlier this year due to Chinese “intervention”. Taiwan announced 372 new cases and 12 deaths in its latest daily update. Poland will raise the limit for the number of guests at large gatherings such as weddings to 150 from 50 from 6 June. People who have been vaccinated against the coronavirus will not be counted as part of this limit Russia’s single-dose Sputnik Light vaccine has been approved for use in Mauritius. Russia’s third vaccine, CoviVac, is more than 80% effective, according to preliminary data. Mexico has revised its death count, adding 4,272 fatalities. The clinical review of past deaths, by a team of doctors and nurses, is largely a record-keeping exercise. The Victorian government in Australia will now require people to check in at retail stores and supermarkets regardless of the length of time they spend in the store, as new data reveals a huge increase in check-ins to the Service Victoria app once the state forced businesses to begin using it. The Victorian government in Australia will now require people to check in at retail stores and supermarkets regardless of the length of time they spend in the store, as new data reveals a huge increase in check-ins to the Service Victoria app once the state forced businesses to begin using it. As part of the extension of the lockdown in Melbourne, the acting premier, James Merlino, announced on Wednesday that supermarkets and retailers would be required to make everyone check in when they entered into the store. Previously it was only a recommendation. After the state recorded a number of Covid-19 transmissions at retail stores where the contacts had “fleeting” contact, Victoria’s chief health officer, Prof Brett Sutton, said the change was to ensure records of everyone at potential exposure sites were complete. “We are in a position now where the Victorian community is motivated to do the right thing and they understand the importance of contact tracing in this space,” he said. “And even though we have been doing really well in identifying people at all exposure sites, I think everyone recognises that we have to do absolutely everything in our power to be able to chase down every single person who may be exposed because it is that one person who is not found who may be the one who spreads it.” The Victorian government launched its Covid QR-code check-in app, Service Victoria, at the end of November 2020 but continued to allow hospitality venues to to use their own QR-code systems to record people visiting. Read more of Josh Taylor’s report here: Victoria makes Covid check-in mandatory at shops after transmissions from ‘fleeting’ visits Drugmaker AstraZeneca has said it would soon provide Thailand with 1.8m doses of locally manufactured Covid-19 vaccine, the first of multiple batches this month, just days out from the launch of its mass vaccination drive. The announcement in a joint statement by AstraZeneca and Siam Bioscience, a firm owned by Thailand’s king, comes amid public anxiety about vaccine supplies, as the country suffers its most severe outbreak so far. The statement did not say whether the Thai plant would make all 6m doses that Thailand’s government has promised would be available this month. Reuters report that the government’s immunisation drive starts on Monday and relies almost entirely on its reserved 61m doses of AstraZeneca vaccine, the majority of which it said would come from Siam Bioscience, which is making vaccines for the first time. Questions about Siam Bioscience meeting production targets are sensitive because King Maha Vajiralongkorn is its sole owner. Insulting Thailand’s monarchy is a crime punishable by up to 15 years in prison. Thai health minister Anutin Charnvirakul said on Wednesday the promised 6m doses would come this month “as planned”, but did not specify delivery dates or how many would be sourced locally. “We will get AstraZeneca vaccine. It may come from wherever, but all AstraZeneca just the same. It could be made in Thailand or imported from overseas. It depends on AstraZeneca’s supply chain,” Anutin told reporters. A one-liner from Reuters here that Russia’s single-dose Sputnik Light vaccine against Covid-19 has been approved for use in Mauritius, Russia’s RDIF sovereign wealth fund, which markets the shot internationally, said today. Germany’s top diplomat in Taipei has said his government has been helping in talks between Taiwan and drugmaker BioNTech to supply Covid-19 vaccines, after Taiwan said a deal fell apart earlier this year due to Chinese “intervention”. China denied that accusation. But a war of words escalated after Taiwan rejected Beijing’s offer to supply it with shots made by Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group, which holds a contract to sell them in Greater China. In a Facebook post in Chinese on Wednesday, Thomas Prinz, Germany’s de facto ambassador to Taiwan, said they had “noticed the recent controversy regarding vaccine acquisition”. “Please believe that the German government, especially federal economy minister Altmaier himself, have made great efforts in the continuous communication and coordination between Taiwan and BioNTech,” he said, adding that whether a contract is eventually signed would depend on the two parties, report Reuters. “If the parties to the contract can reach a consensus, the federal government is naturally happy to see it happen.” Nicola Slawson has opened up our UK live blog for the day, which is immediately leading with the debate over the government’s plan for post-pandemic “catch-up” education provision in England. You can follow that with her here: I’ll be continuing here with the latest coronavirus developments from around the world. My colleague Frances Ryan writes for us this morning about how transformational being able to work from home has been life-changing for disabled people, and says don’t take it away now: At the start of the first lockdown, I reported that society was opening up to millions of disabled and chronically ill people as “virtual living” became the norm – from Zoom job interviews and streamed gigs and theatre to NHS phone appointments. But just as it took the non-disabled public to experience a dose of what disabled people have for years before access was improved, the fear is that any gains made during the pandemic will be discarded now that the wider public no longer need them themselves. Take work for example. The shift to working at home over the past year brought new opportunities to those previously excluded from the workforce. As one woman with agoraphobia told me: “Lockdown has opened my world” – it allowed her to get a job from her front room. But as ministers and some employers push for a return to the office, many disabled workers are worried their hard-won progress will go backwards. A research scientist with endometriosis and IBS told me her employer has already stopped letting her work from home full-time, even though her job can be done remotely. “The office is ‘going back to normal’ and they don’t want us at home even though I can do a better job [here],” she said. The Zoom pub quiz became a cliche of lockdown, but what many of us did informally with friends was also replicated by companies, with art exhibitions streaming online or bars running virtual club nights. As venues open back up, I’m hearing from scores of disabled people losing out.

The main Covid focus in England today hasn’t been the pandemic itself, but government proposals to help pupils “catch-up” on learning they may have missed. The package has been roundly criticised, as Haroon Siddique reports: The £1.4bn announced for the post-pandemic catch-up programme for pupils in England is “pitiful” and a fraction of that committed by other countries to help children’s education, a school leaders’ union has said. Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), hit out at the government on Wednesday as it faced scrutiny over why the money is about a 10th of the £15bn total understood to have been recommended by the education recovery commissioner, Sir Kevan Collins. Barton said the government package was “dispiriting” and accused the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, of having lower ambitions for children than those of his union’s members. “It’s pretty pitiful, only yesterday we were hearing stories about extending the school day and even if some people disagreed with it, at least there was a sense of ‘let’s do something radical, let’s do something different’,” he told Sky News. “Today’s announcement essentially equates to £50 per head, you compare that with the USA which is putting £1,600 per head, per young person, or the Netherlands, £2,500 per head. So what is it about those children in the Netherlands or the USA that makes them worth more than our government seems to say? It’s time to stop the rhetoric I think and start the action on behalf of children and young people.” During a series of interviews of Wednesday, Williamson struggled to explain the discrepancy between the announced government spending and that recommended by Collins, who was appointed in February by Downing Street to lead efforts to make up for the damage done by the coronavirus pandemic, particularly to pupils from more deprived backgrounds.

People who have been vaccinated against the coronavirus will not be counted as part of this limit, Reuters report that Adam Niedzielski told a news conference. Many countries in the world have been looking on enviously at the very small number of cases in Australia over recent months, but a new cluster has left people asking questions about the country’s approach. Michael Toole writes for us this morning: Just two weeks ago, Australians were living in a Covid-19-free environment that was unthinkable this time last year. Even in Melbourne, people were once again meeting family and friends at cafes, pubs and cinemas. Football games were played in front of packed stadiums. But that came to an abrupt halt when a new cluster of cases was identified in Melbourne early last week. This outbreak has now grown to 60 known cases across the greater metropolitan area, including several aged care workers and two residents. Genomic sequencing links all these cases to a man who was infected while staying in an Adelaide quarantine hotel. As Melbourne moves into a second week of lockdown, it’s worth asking why we’re back in this all too familiar situation. Two issues that loom the largest in explaining how we got here are a hotel quarantine system that clearly doesn’t work as well as it could, and a more concerning virus variant that seems to have taken full advantage of the time it circulated undetected from the Wollert man to case number five – the key piece of rotten luck in this outbreak. Add to that a painfully slow rollout of vaccines and, deeply worryingly, the related lack of attention to the safety of aged care home residents and staff. Read more here: Michael Toole – Australia is in a race against Covid-19. I’m waiting to hear the starting gun International flights to Vietnam’s two biggest cities are to resume, AFP reports, reversing a short-lived ban imposed over fears of a new coronavirus wave. The Civil Aviation Administration of Vietnam on Monday announced a temporary suspension for international passenger arrivals at Hanoi’s Noi Bai airport from 1-7 June. A similar decision was in force for the airport in commercial capital Ho Chi Minh City until 14 June, as the country struggles to contain a virus outbreak in more than half of its territories. But today the aviation authority told airports and airlines that it had reversed the suspension, without mentioning a timeframe or giving an explanation. Vietnam has managed to keep infection rates low, but cases have more than doubled in the past month and now stand at more than 7,500, with 48 deaths. With less than two months left until the start of the Tokyo Olympic Games, Japan’s Asahi Breweries still doesn’t know whether fans will be allowed into stadiums to buy its beer. Japan has scaled back its Olympic plans amid the pandemic and a slow national vaccine rollout. Foreign spectators won’t be allowed in the country and organisers have yet to decide how many domestic spectators, if any, can attend. More than 60 Japanese companies together paid a record of more than $3bn to sponsor the Tokyo Games, an event most Japanese want cancelled or delayed again. Sponsors paid another $200m to extend contracts after the Games were delayed last year. Many are uncertain how to proceed with advertising campaigns or marketing events, according to 12 officials and sources at companies directly involved in sponsorship who spoke to Reuters. Asahi has the exclusive rights to sell beer, wine and non-alcoholic beer at the stadiums, but even if spectators are allowed, the Tokyo government has no plans to allow alcohol at its public viewing sites outside venues, a representative said. Sponsors have grown frustrated with what they see as slow decision-making and have complained to the organisers, Eimi Yamamitsu and Maki Shiraki report. “There are so many different scenarios that we can’t prepare,” said the source. Some domestic firms, worried about opposition to the Games, have called off plans for commercials featuring Olympic athletes or supporting Japanese national teams, said a person with direct knowledge of the matter. “I’m worried that by airing Olympic ads, it could be negative for the company,” said a source at a domestic sponsor. “At this point, no amount of publicity we could get would make up for what we paid.” Some top-tier global sponsors, whose contracts run until 2024, are scaling down Tokyo promotions and deferring budgets for Beijing in 2022 or Paris in 2024, said a second person with direct knowledge of the matter, and the employee of the sponsor company who was briefed on the issue. But domestic sponsors don’t have another Olympics. “That’s why we can’t simply quit,” said the source at the domestic sponsor. Bit of a reporting chain here, but Reuters is quoting Interfax saying that Russia’s third vaccine against Covid-19, CoviVac, is more than 80% effective according to preliminary data. The Chumakov Centre could produce six times more than the previously planned 10m doses of the vaccine a year, Interfax added. Australia’s Covid vaccination programme has lacked urgency at every stage, with the government forced to revise its own targets and never seeming to meet its own goals. Victoria’s latest outbreak has exposed Scott Morrison government’s failure to successfully get the vaccine out to even the most vulnerable in the community. The outbreak has hit unvaccinated aged care workers, despite federal promises they would be vaccinated by March. Along with mixed messages about the urgency of getting Australia vaccinated, the Morrison government became mired in a debate about whether Australia’s coronavirus vaccination rollout is or is not a race. Our multimedia team has put together this video report: Taiwan has announced 372 new cases of Covid-19 and 12 deaths in its latest daily update. The CECC also announced 177 cases across the preceding five days from the backlog of test results. The number is a significant increase from yesterday, when 262 new cases were reported, with just 65 from the backlog. The backlog is clearing, authorities have assured, but in the meantime it has continued to cause problems in analysis of trends and response measures. Health and welfare minister Chen Shih-Chung said it wasn’t clear if today’s rise was due to an increase in cases or faster reporting times, local media said. Chen also gave some updates about Taiwan’s vaccination process – a complicated issue, which involves accusations of geopolitical interference as well as of government bungling. The government has procured around 1m doses so far for 23.5 million people, and has ordered tens of millions more – a significant proportion of which are domestically produced vaccine candidates in trial stage. Chen told the media he hopes that once they have enough supply, they will be able to administer 1m doses per week, through Taiwan’s 300 hospitals, 800 clinics and 200 other locations. According to local media he said any businesses with more than 1,000 employees can host a vaccination stop. Chen said the government hopes to have 60% of the population receive at least one dose by October. It’s potentially a tall order, requiring about 14m doses. Currently Taiwan has received 850,000 doses, a mix of AstraZeneca and Moderna. It has ordered about 4.5m more from Moderna, 9.2m from Astrazeneca, and 4.7m via Covax, but the imminent arrival of any of these is far from confirmed given the aforementioned complications and global shortages. Another 10m have been ordered via two Taiwan producers, but these vaccines are still in trial stage. Producers have said they intend to apply for emergency use this month – international approval likely a long way after that. In the UK, Labour’s opposition spokesperson on education, Kate Green, has called for more support for extra-curricular activities in schools as part of the Covid catch-up package being proposed by the government. She told BBC Breakfast: “What we’re proposing is that there should be a range of measures in a package of support for children and young people. “Yes more time for small group tutoring and catching up on lost learning, but children can’t learn well if they’re worried, if they’re anxious, if they’re not having time to play and develop. “So we’re also suggesting support for extra-curricular activities, play, drama, art and so on, and of course in putting in mental health support in schools.” PA Media reports she added: “Children need some time to relax and enjoy life, over the summer and into the new school year we think the important thing is to make sure the fabulous facilities that schools have, the sports fields, the art rooms, the music rooms and so on, can be used for out-of-school activities too. “So we’re talking about school being open for longer but not for lots of extra formal learning, we don’t want children doing maths at five and six in the evening when they’re really tired.” Somewhere, someone in the UK government wrote “education” on their media grid for today, and so education minister Gavin Williamson has been sent out on the airwaves with details of plans to help pupils in the UK catch-up with schooling they may have missed during the pandemic. He has endured quite a torrid time in a somewhat bad-tempered appearance on Sky News, where at one point he was told that the presenter hates doing shouty, repetitive interviews, but that the minister just wasn’t answering the questions. In particular, he was pressed over the discrepancy between the money offered – £1.4bn – and the amount that catch-up tsar Sir Kevan Collins has said is needed to increase education opportunities – £15bn. PA Media quotes Williams as saying: “It is a lot of money and it builds on £1.7bn that we’ve already committed in terms of actually delivering for children – it is an extra 100m hours of tutoring. “It is making sure that children who need that help, who need that support, that we’re delivering that tutoring revolution to help them get it. “But we recognise it is part of a process. Over the past 12 months, we have already announced a previous £1.7bn worth of additional funding and we are looking at a whole raft of additional ideas for how we can continue to support our children, making sure none of them are left behind. “We have been working very closely with Sir Kevan Collins and actually the interventions around tutoring, driving up teaching quality, these are very much built on the work we’ve been doing together, recognising how incredibly important it is that we take on these interventions in order to help children.” There’s more detail on the government plans here from my colleagues Peter Walker and Rachel Hall, who write that: Pupils will be offered an extra 100m hours of tuition under post-pandemic catch-up plans unveiled today – but the government faced immediate criticism of the £1.4bn programme, with its own tsar warning “more will be needed”. After months of unprecedented school closures, £1.4bn will be spent on up to 6m sets of 15-hour tutoring courses for disadvantaged pupils as well as an expansion of an existing fund for helping 16- to 19-year-olds with subjects such as English and maths, the Department for Education (DfE) said. There is also provision for extra training and support for teachers, and funding to allow some year-13 students to repeat their final year if it was badly affected by the pandemic. It gave no immediate verdict on mooted plans to extend schools days by 30 minutes. This idea, criticised as misplaced by some teaching unions, will be the subject of a separate review due to report later in the year. Today’s WorldView email from the Washington Post by Ishaan Tharoor makes for quite bleak reading. He writes that while in the US, life is returning to normal, the pandemic is getting worse, even when it seems like it’s getting better: The pandemic is hardly in retreat elsewhere. The emergence of more virulent variants and the slowness of vaccination efforts in many places outside the West have contributed to deadly new waves. Coronavirus case counts worldwide are already higher in 2021 than they were in 2020. Southeast Asia, once a bastion of resistance to the virus, is in the grip of a harrowing spike in infections. Cases in Thailand and Vietnam rose dramatically over the past month. Malaysia is now registering more new infections per million people than any medium- or large-size country in Asia, surpassing India. In Africa, concerns are growing over the possible arrival of a new wave powered by a more transmissible variant of the virus, with the health systems in many countries at risk of being quickly subsumed by a surge of infections. A recent study found that the continent has the world’s highest death rate of patients critically ill with covid-19, thanks to limited intensive care facilities and reserves of vital medical supplies like oxygen. In parts of Latin America, the virus rages on, largely unabated. Peru, according to its own government-adjusted data, now has the worst covid-19 mortality rate per capita in the world. Even in East Asia, where a handful of nations set the gold standard in preventing community spread, the virus is on the march. Taiwan has seen an explosion of cases over the past month. In Japan, which still intends to host the Summer Olympics, numerous areas including Tokyo remain under a state of emergency.

He’s worried that if face coverings and social distancing requirements continue on public transport in England after they have been dropped in other settings, it will stigmatise the use of buses and trains. He said: We need to see public transport moving at the same pace as the rest of the country. If you no longer have to wear a face covering in certain situations such as hospitality and retail but you do on public transport, we think that would undermine confidence in public transport. If people have this view that going on a bus or a coach carries a greater risk of catching Covid, in the longer term that will encourage people to use their car. Good morning, it is Martin Belam here taking over in London, where this morning the mayor Sadiq Khan has been warning fans of Scottish football not to travel if they don’t have tickets when England and Scotland face each other at Wembley on 18 June. Khan joins the Scottish government and Scottish Football Association (SFA) to ask fans not to travel to the city unless they have a ticket, or a safe place to watch the match. He said: “I am so excited for Euro 2020 and one of the games that I am looking forward to the most is England’s match with Scotland at Wembley. “I have some amazing memories of England v Scotland games in the past and I love the atmosphere that Scottish fans always bring to major football tournaments. “However, I am today urging all fans to only come to London if you have a ticket for the match or if you have arranged a safe place to watch it from, in compliance with Covid-19 guidelines.” He added: “I want to be completely clear that Scottish fans will not be able to access their traditional Trafalgar Square base, as it will be used as a socially-distanced fan zone for key workers who are helping our city through the pandemic. “Due to Covid regulations there are no alternative sites for fans to gather in large numbers in central London.” Here’s how UK media reported the great news on Tuesday of zero Covid-related deaths in the country for the first day since the pandemic began. Many papers suggest that the first day without a single Covid death for 10 months means the complete easing of lockdown restrictions will go ahead in England as planned on 21 June. Mexico has revised its death count, adding 4,272 fatalities. The clinical review of past deaths, by a team of doctors and nurses, is largely a record-keeping exercise, AP reports. Mexico’s government has long acknowledged that the true death toll from the pandemic is far higher than the current total of 227,840, due to low testing capabilities. Many Mexicans have died at home, or never been tested. As well as the medical team-led reviews, another process also provides adjusted figures. The computerised search of death certificates for Covid-related symptoms has suggested more than 350,000 have died, which would give Mexico one of the highest per-capita fatality rates in the world. Reuters: A shipment of coronavirus vaccines to North Korea via the global Covax sharing programme that was expected for late May has been delayed again amid protracted consultations, South Korea’s unification ministry said on Tuesday. Covax, which secures vaccines for poor countries, has said it will provide nearly 2 million doses of AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine to North Korea. “Countries that want Covax support are required to hold various consultations and submit some documents including an inoculation plan,” a ministry official said. “But in North Korea’s case, such consultations have been prolonged and it appears that the shipment will be made later than initially planned.” Insular and secretive North Korea has not commented on any consultations on vaccines. It has not officially confirmed any Covid-19 infections, although Seoul officials have said an outbreak there cannot be ruled out as the North had trade and people-to-people exchanges with China before closing its border early last year. The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) alliance, which co-leads Covax with the World Health Organization (WHO), said work is ongoing and discussions continue with North Korea, but no shipment date was finalised. GAVI said last month that shipments have not been made to North Korea due to its lack of “technical preparedness” and global supply shortages but could be expected later this year. In a statement last week to the ongoing WHO annual assembly, North Korea accused unspecified countries of dominating vaccine supplies and causing a global “bottleneck” due to “national egoism.” “Some countries are procuring and storing the vaccines more than their needs ... when other countries can’t even procure it,” it said. In the last few hours a few countries have reported updated daily case numbers. India has reported 132,788 new cases over the past 24 hours, and an additional 3,207 deaths. Health ministry data says the country’s infection tally is about 28.3 million, with more than 335,000 deaths. In Germany, the Robert Koch Institute has said 4,917 new cases has brought the country’s total to 3,687,828, and an additional 179 fatalities has raised the death toll to 88,774. China has reported 24 new cases, including 10 domestic cases all in Guangdong province where authorities have imposed localised lockdown measures to control an outbreak. It also reported seven asymptomatic cases in Guangdong, which are counted separately. Via AFP: The World Health Organization has approved the Sinovac Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use – the second Chinese vaccine to receive the WHO’s green light. The UN health agency signed off on CoronaVac, a two-dose vaccine developed by the Beijing-based firm which is already being deployed in several countries around the world. The WHO said the emergency use listing (EUL) gives countries, funders, procuring agencies and communities assurance that the vaccine has met international standards. Last month Sinopharm became the first Chinese vaccine to be approved by the WHO. The organisation has also given EUL status to vaccines being made by Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and the AstraZeneca jab being produced in India, South Korea and the EU, which it counts separately. WHO’s listing paves the way for countries worldwide to approve and import a vaccine for distribution quickly, especially those states without an international-standard regulator of their own. It also opens the door for the jabs to enter the Covax global vaccine-sharing facility, which aims to provide equitable access to doses around the world, particularly in poorer countries. Currently only AstraZeneca and some Pfizer jabs are flowing through the scheme. Read more here: Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s continuing rolling coverage of the pandemic. You can catch up on the previous live blog here, or see below for a quick roundup of the past 24 hours. The Australian state of Victoria has extended its lockdown for another seven days as it works to control an outbreak in Melbourne. The UK has enjoyed a day without a single reported Covid death for the first time since the pandemic began. India said it is aiming to triple capacity to 10 million jabs per day by July to avert another wave of Covid-19 infections as deadly as the outbreak suffered since April. A Brazilian Supreme Court judge has given president Jair Bolsonaro five days to submit information regarding the government’s decision to host the Copa America football tournament despite the nation’s ongoing struggles with Covid-19. A decrease in local Covid-19 vaccine production has slowed the pace of Brazil’s inoculation drive and contributed to a growing number of people not taking their second doses, according to the latest data from the Fiocruz biomedical institute. Heathrow airport in London has begun processing arrivals from red list countries in a dedicated terminal following concerns about them mixing with other passengers. Travellers arriving from red list nations on direct flights are being taken to Terminal 3. Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa called on faster delivery of vaccines to poorer countries, including by waiving patents on vaccine development. Peru has revised its official Covid-19 death toll to 180,764, nearly triple the previous official figure of 69,342, following a government review that shows the severity of the outbreak in the country. The World Health Organisation has recommended a new set of names for the coronavirus “variants of concern”, which will be known by letters of the Greek alphabet. Alpha is the new name for UK/Kent (B.1.1.7), Beta for South Africa (B.1.351), Gamma for Brazil (P.1) and Delta for the variant first detected in India (B.1.617.2). Malaysia has begun a tough nationwide lockdown to battle a worsening coronavirus outbreak. Of almost 2,800 deaths from Covid-19 recorded in the country of 32 million since the start of the pandemic, over 40 percent were in May alone. Israel announced it will begin phasing out coronavirus-related payments to the unemployed and Ireland announced similar steps later this year while maintaining other income and business supports as the economy fully reopens. The Coachella music festival will return to the US in April 2022 after being repeatedly delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic, organisers have announced.","charCount":"73502","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/yohannes-lowe\">Yohannes Lowe</a> (now); <a href=\"profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a> and <a href=\"profile/helen-davidson\">Helen Davidson</a> (earlier)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2021/jun/02/china-communist-party-happiness-xi-jinping-negative-image","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-02T23:14:14Z","webTitle":"China Communist party ‘striving for people’s happiness’, says Xi Jinping, in call for charm offensive","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/02/china-communist-party-happiness-xi-jinping-negative-image","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/jun/02/china-communist-party-happiness-xi-jinping-negative-image","fields":{"headline":"China Communist party ‘striving for people’s happiness’, says Xi Jinping, in call for charm offensive","standfirst":"<p>China must tell the world a better story about itself, says president, as he seeks stronger ‘international voice’</p>","trailText":"China must tell the world a better story about itself, says president, as he seeks stronger ‘international voice’","byline":"Helen Davidson in Taipei","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c9a1b00471c0d15585b3d11b868ebeae51b6da49\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c9a1b00471c0d15585b3d11b868ebeae51b6da49/0_184_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Xi Jinping: ‘We should help the foreign people realise that the Communist party really strives for the happiness of the Chinese people.’\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Xi Jinping: ‘We should help the foreign people realise that the Communist party really strives for the happiness of the Chinese people.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Xinhua/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>China needs to improve the way it tells the world stories about itself, and convince people the ruling party is striving for the happiness of all Chinese people, Xi Jinping has said.</p> <p>The Chinese president’s comments to a Communist party meeting on Tuesday come amid the country’s growing isolation in the global community, and tension with international media, largely driven by international concerns over human rights abuses.</p> <p>Suggesting continued concern over Beijing’s negative image, Xi said it was crucial that China develop a stronger “international voice” which matches its national strength and global status, to present a “true, three-dimensional and comprehensive China” to the world, according to state news agency <a href=\"http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2021-06/01/c_139983105.htm\">Xinhua</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/01/wuhan-coronavirus-lab-leak-covid-virus-origins-china\">If the Wuhan lab-leak hypothesis is true, expect a political earthquake | Thomas Frank</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“We should strengthen the propaganda and interpretation of the Communist party of China, and help foreign people realise that the Communist party of China [CCP] really strives for the happiness of the Chinese people,” the report cited Xi as saying.

Henderson, who has not played since February because of a groin injury, was unavailable against Austria after feeling discomfort yesterday morning. “With Jordan we had hoped to involve him today,” Southgate said. “This morning he wasn’t so happy with how he felt. We’ve scanned him just to be certain. There’s no problem on the scan so he’ll be able to resume training but we’ve taken the decision to leave him out of the game.” Jack Grealish, who has just returned from injury, needed ice on his shin after being substituted. “I’ve had an injury recently so to get 70 minutes under my belt was a perfect week,” the playmaker said. “It’s not shin splints, it’s a bit of stress on my shin. I’m not concerned. I still need to keep on top of it, to heal it after the games, so that’s why I put the ice on it.”","charCount":"3496","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/jacob-steinberg\">Jacob Steinberg</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2021/jun/03/western-australia-gas-project-would-create-more-emissions-than-adani-and-damage-indigenous-rock-art","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-02T23:03:14Z","webTitle":"Western Australia gas project ‘would create more emissions than Adani and damage Indigenous rock art’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/jun/03/western-australia-gas-project-would-create-more-emissions-than-adani-and-damage-indigenous-rock-art","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2021/jun/03/western-australia-gas-project-would-create-more-emissions-than-adani-and-damage-indigenous-rock-art","fields":{"headline":"Western Australia gas project ‘would create more emissions than Adani and damage Indigenous rock art’","standfirst":"<p>Woodside’s proposed Scarborough development is equivalent of 15 coal-fired power plants, environment experts say</p>","trailText":"Woodside’s proposed Scarborough development is equivalent of 15 coal-fired power plants, environment experts say","byline":"Adam Morton Environment editor","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7116a342811dd9b4647d6ea7bfbb1396397ab0c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7116a342811dd9b4647d6ea7bfbb1396397ab0c5/0_187_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Part of the LNG projects in the north of Western Australia.

Released on Thursday, the report suggested the development could lead to lifetime emissions equivalent to that released by 15 coal-fired power plants.

The project’s major proponent, Woodside, said there had been many opportunities for interested parties to comment on the proposal over the past two-and-a-half years. Through a spokesperson, the company said the development had been referred separately to state and commonwealth authorities as required. The federal Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment found in August 2019 the pipeline works did not have to be assessed under national conservation laws, and the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environment Management Authority had approved the development of the gasfield in April 2020. At a state level, the Environment Protection Authority (EPA) last year approved the pipeline construction in WA waters near the shore and found the expansion of the processing facility was only a minor change to previous approval decisions and did not require a full assessment. The spokesperson said Woodside was awaiting final approval from the WA environment and climate action minister, Amber-Jade Sanderson. If approved, a final investment decision on the $11bn development is expected later this year.

He said the EPA should be asked to carry out a full independent assessment of the entire project. He said not to do so would be “reckless in the extreme”, citing a recent major report by the International Energy Agency that found all fossil fuel expansion should end now if the planet is to meet the goals agreed in Paris. The conservation council’s president, former Labor premier Carmen Lawrence, said many of the circumstances that led to Rio Tinto destroying an Aboriginal heritage site at Juukan Gorge applied to the Scarborough development. “It is now clear that pollution from gas processing on the Burrup is having a significant effect on the Murujuga rock art,” she said. “Allowing further expansion of gas processing on this site will increase both the duration and severity of these impacts and this must be assessed carefully before any further decisions are made, not as an afterthought. The conservation council has launched a supreme court challenge to the processing of gas from Scarborough at an expanded Pluto processing facility, and appealed the approval of the nearshore pipe development.

later case whether the Anglo-Swedish pharmaceuticals company broke its contract with the EU, heard the commission argue on Wednesday that an “urgent need” for the shots warranted an emergency order.</p> <p>AstraZeneca supplied only 30m of the 120m Covid-19 vaccine doses it was scheduled to deliver to the bloc by the end of March, and the commission says the company is on course to deliver 70m of a promised 180m in the second quarter.</p> <p>The commission’s lawyer, Rafaël Jafferali, told the court the company now expected to deliver the full 300m doses in its contract by the end of December, but added: “With a six-month delay, it’s obviously a failure.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a

pandemic’s first declared case.</p> <p>The newspaper also said researchers had collected samples seven years earlier from a mine in southwestern China, where miners had contracted a mysterious illness from a new, bat-borne coronavirus.</p> <p>Repeating an earlier denial of the report, Zhao Lijian, spokesman for China’s foreign ministry, accused the US of “spreading conspiracy theories and disinformation such as a laboratory leak”.</p> <p>The theory that the killer virus leaked from a Chinese lab was originally fuelled by, among others, the administration of former US president Donald Trump.</p> <p>Zhao said it was “disrespectful” to the WHO probe to revive the theory, and risked an “undermining of global solidarity to fight the virus”.</p> <p>Fauci had said: “I am not convinced about that, I think we should continue to investigate what went on in China until we continue to find out to the best of our ability what happened.

The cases have been detected in North, Central and South America, as well as the Caribbean, though no community transmission has been associated with this variant, Sylvain Aldighieri, PAHO’s incident manager, said in a briefing from Washington. The number of Covid patients in intensive care units in France fell by 19 to 3,330 on Wednesday, the health ministry reported, according to Reuters. The overall number of people in hospital with the virus was 837, a fall of 18,593. The health ministry also reported 144 more Covid deaths in hospitals on Wednesday, slightly higher than the 141 reported a week ago. This is Damien Gayle taking the reins on the live blog for a little bit, while Mattha has a break A French court has found four students guilty of inciting racial hatred online by posting anti-Asian tweets blaming Chinese people for the spread of coronavirus. AFP reports: The four, aged between 19 and 24 and without criminal records, were sentenced to two days of civic education by the Paris criminal court, and ordered to pay €250 euros to each of the seven plaintiffs and up to 1,000 euros in fines. A fifth accused student was found not guilty. The students posted the tweets after president Emmanuel Macron announced a second round of strict stay-at-home rules on 29 October. The four were found guilty of “public incitement, not followed by acts, to commit a voluntary offence against the integrity of a person because of their origins”, the verdict read. Soc Lam, a lawyer for the Association of Young Chinese People in France, said the ruling was a welcome sign the courts were taking online hate speech seriously. The coronavirus pandemic has led to “new dimensions of anti-Asian racism,” according to study last year by France’s Institute of National Demographic Studies (INED). Critics have accused police of neglecting to address threats against France’s Chinese community. Switzerland is to re-open indoor restaurants and people will no longer be required to work from home, the government has announced, saying it was lifting restrictions faster than previously planned. AFP has the story: Switzerland said its fourth wave of easing coronavirus measures would take place on Monday, with the wealthy Alpine nation moving to a stabilisation phase in managing the pandemic, as it eyes completing the vaccination of high-risk groups by the end of May. “The Federal Council is going further than proposed,” the government said in a statement. “In so doing, it is responding to the improved epidemiological situation.” The government said the requirement to work from home was now being downgraded to a recommendation, while public and private gathering limits were being raised. “As of Monday, restaurants will once again be able to serve guests indoors,” the statement announced. Up to four people will be allowed at a table, though contact details will have to be recorded. Masks will have to be worn when moving around inside, and the 11:00 pm curfew is being lifted. Outdoor dining reopened in April. “Working from home will be a recommendation rather than a requirement for businesses that carry out weekly testing. A return to the office should be gradual,” the government said. At public events, up to 100 people will be allowed to gather indoors and up to 300 people outdoors (up from 50 and 100 respectively), up to a maximum of half of the capacity of venues. At private gatherings, 30 people will be able to meet indoors, and up to 50 outdoors - up from 10 and 15 respectively. Johnson &amp; Johnson’s single-shot Covid vaccine is to be limited in Belgium to people aged 41 and over, authorities have said following the death of a woman who received the jab. AFP has the full story: The country’s inter-ministerial health body focused on the pandemic said that restriction will be “provisionally” applied pending further guidance from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on Johnson &amp; Johnson’s Janssen vaccine. The move underlined the level of caution EU countries are showing to Covid vaccines, particularly the two adenovirus ones made by Johnson &amp; Johnson and by AstraZeneca. Those two have suspected links to very rare but very serious instances of blood clots coupled with low platelet levels which were seen in several deaths. Last month the EMA drew a link between rare blood clots and AstraZeneca and Johnson &amp; Johnson jabs but stressed that the benefits of the vaccines outweighed the risk. Several EU countries have restricted the use of AstraZeneca’s vaccine to older people, typically over 55 or 60. Austria is phasing it out and plans to stop using it in June. Denmark has dropped the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine from its national vaccination programme altogether. Non-EU member Norway, which has dropped AstraZeneca, is offering Johnson &amp; Johnson only to volunteers. In Belgium, the death of the woman - said to be aged under 40 and vaccinated through her employer outside of the country - was the “only case” identified, the inter-ministerial body said in a statement. The woman died on Friday after being admitted to hospital with “severe thrombosis and a deficit of blood platelets”, it said. Mexico will tomorrow receive more than 2.2 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine as part of the global Covax vaccine-sharing plan, foreign minister Marcelo Ebrard has said. The global programme - co-led by the GAVI vaccine alliance and the World Health Organization (WHO) - aims to provide vaccines for low and middle income countries but has experienced delays amid worldwide vaccine shortages after pharmaceutical companies fell short on their pledges. Ebrard said Covax has informed Mexico that 2,229,600 doses will arrive from Amsterdam. “This will ensure the [supply of] doses for people 50 years of age and over,” Ebrard said on Twitter. Whistleblower protection groups have urged the World Health Organization to launch an independent review into the case of an Italian researcher who reported being pressured to falsify data in a now-spiked WHO report into Italy’s coronavirus response. AP has the story: The groups, including Transparency International, Whistleblowing International Network and some 30 other public health and anti-corruption groups, sent an open letter to the president of the World Health Assembly. The assembly, WHO’s highest decision-making body, is made up of all WHO member states and is meeting this week. In the letter, the signatories called for the UN agency to commit to reforming its whistleblowing protection policy. They said the Italian researcher, Dr Francesco Zambon, had suffered retaliatory treatment for having reported the incident within WHO’s internal ethics system. Zambon resigned in March, saying he had been isolated and marginalised after he complained internally, and then publicly, about the scandal. Zambon has said he was pressured by a then-assistant director general, Dr Ranieri Guerra, to falsify data about Italy’s preparedness going into the pandemic in a report he and other researchers were writing to help other countries prepare as Covid-19 swept across the globe last year. Emails and drafts of the report show Guerra wanted the report to say that Italy had “updated and reconfirmed” its pandemic preparedness plan in 2016. Zambon says Italy’s plan dated from 2006 and refused to make the change. The report was published May 13, 2020, but was taken down from the website a day later, after WHO’s Beijing office flagged politically sensitive problems with a timeline about the virus’ origins in China. Zambon says he corrected the timeline and had the report reprinted, but WHO never re-posted it or distributed it. Spanish prime minister Pedro Sanchez has discussed opportunities for China to co-invest in projects financed by EU pandemic recovery funds with Chinese president Xi Jinping. Earlier today, Hungary approved a bill essential to the green-lighting of EU’s recovery fund, bringing the bloc a step closer to putting the deal into operation. Reuters reports that regulators in Brussels and Washington have been wary of China’s increased clout in Europe and frown upon Chinese investment in critical infrastructure. But the Spanish government said in a statement Sanchez had told Xi he was confident that common ground could be found to ratify a long-awaited investment agreement between Beijing and Brussels, and suggested Spain could play a constructive role in strengthening Sino-EU relations. With Spain due to receive some €140 billion in pandemic recovery funds in the coming years, Sanchez pointed to investment opportunities in the “green transition, electric mobility, circular economy and digitalisation”. Reuters also reports that ahead of the first disbursement of the EU cash, Spain has also been courting Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds to co-invest on major projects. Last year, the government passed a decree giving it a veto on foreign acquisitions of stakes bigger than 10% in Spanish companies deemed strategic. Thailand is modifying its immunisation strategy to target worst-hit areas and sectors where clusters are most likely to emerge, officials have said. Reuters has more: The strategy prioritises the epicentre Bangkok and nearby provinces, tourism hotspots, construction camps and potential spreaders, like public transport workers, the government’s COVID-19 taskforce said. Thailand reported a daily record 41 deaths today, bringing overall fatalities to 873, about 90% of which were during the current outbreak that started early in April. The outbreak is also responsible for the bulk of its total 137,894 cumulative cases. Thailand is due to start mass vaccinations next month and of its than 66 million people, only 2.5 million have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine, mostly the Sinovac brand. Thailand has reserved 61 million locally-made AstraZeneca vaccines for its main drive. Vaccine distribution had earlier been based on reservations made by provincial health authorities, some with low cases numbers, said taskforce spokesman Taweesin Wisanuyothin. The health ministry said two doses of Sinovac vaccine had reduced the risk of infection by 83.3%, according to its study on the holiday island of Phuket, where 22% of the population has received both required doses. Perhaps conveniently for an incumbent candidate, Zambian president Edgar Lungu has banned campaign rallies ahead of elections scheduled for 12 August, saying large gatherings risked spreading the Covid-19 virus. True, of course, though the virus travels exponentially faster indoors – where the supermajority of transmissions are believed to occur. Also, he made the comments at a gathering of hundreds of supporters. Reuters reports: Opposition parties have pilloried Lungu’s handling of the crisis. Last year, police shot dead two people after the main opposition party leader was summoned for police questioning over a decade-and-a-half old fraud allegation. Speaking at the launch of his own campaign in the capital Lusaka, clad in dark green jumper and cap representing the ruling Patriotic Front (PF) colours, Lungu told the hundreds of party supporters gathered that he would not hold public rallies, and expected opposition parties to do the same. “Therefore, in my capacity as head of state and the government, I hereby direct the police service and the ministry of health to ensure enforcement of the Covid-19 pandemic health regulations and guidelines without fear or favour,” Lungu said. “What will it benefit you to be holding rallies, but then sacrifice the lives of our citizens and voters to Covid-19 and death?” The southern African nation has recorded more than 93,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19, with more than 1,200 deaths. Opposition leader Hakainde Hichilema’s spokesman, Anthony Bwalya, told Reuters the party would go ahead with its campaign rallies, saying Covid-19 cases had subsided. “President Lungu is being hypocritical, because the gathering outside the conference centre where he launched his campaign was more like a rally,” Bwalya said. Tunisia is counting on Russians and eastern Europeans to help rejuvenate its tourist sector, hit hard by the pandemic and leaving employees in the sector facing severe poverty, AFP reports. “The need to work is stronger than the fear of being contaminated,” said lifeguard Aymen Abdallah, glancing at a half-empty beach in the Mediterranean resort of Sousse where Russians are making a comeback. “If we don’t work, we’ll starve to death.” The lifeguard is relieved to be back at work after an idle eight months. But “normally, the beach would have been full at this time”, he sighed. The North African country reopened its borders to tour operators in late April but then ordered a new week-long partial lockdown at the start of May because of a spike in coronavirus cases. Up to 10 flights a week, mostly from Russia and eastern Europe, have in the past month been touching down at Enfidha, an airport serving Tunisia’s tourism towns. But revenues are down more than 60 percent on 2019, before the pandemic hit. Hotels are authorised to operate at 50 percent of capacity but are struggling to reach that level. “There’s not much profit with just 30 percent hotel occupancy,” lamented Adel Mlayah, deputy director of the high-end Mouradi Palace in Sousse. The hotel normally employs at least 260 staff, but this year no more than 120 are working. While visitors from most West countries are deterred from travel by their governments, those from Russia, the Czech Republic and Poland appeared to have few such qualms. Slovakia has become the second EU country to authorise the use of the Russian-made Sputnik V Covid vaccine, which has not yet been approved by the bloc’s drug regulator. The Slovak government asked health minister Vladimir Lengvarsky to make the jab available by 7 June. Slovakia has 200,000 doses of Sputnik V vaccine in stock but had not allowed its use until now. Hungary is the only other EU nation to use Sputnik V. A secret deal for Slovakia to purchase 2 million Sputnik V shots orchestrated by then-prime minister Igor Matovic triggered a political crisis in March that resulted in the Slovak government’s collapse. Further extraordinary and incendiary claims are continuing to come out from the UK parliamentary committee hearing where the prime minister’s former chief aide Dominic Cummings is giving evidence. The latest allegation is that Boris Johnson said in July: “Chaos is not bad. Chaos means that everyone has to look to me to see who’s in charge.” Here’s our latest coverage, and a link to Andrew Sparrow’s live blog: A “massive anti-vaccination campaign” has been cited by the European Commission as a reason for social media platforms to intensify their factchecking and revise the internal algorithms that can amplify disinformation. France will impose a compulsory quarantine on travellers arriving from the UK because of growing concerns over the spread of the Indian variant of the coronavirus, the government’s spokesman has said. Gabriel Attal told reporters at the end of the cabinet meeting this morning that the government would announce the date when the widely expected decision would come into effect “in the coming hours”. France requires travellers from 16 countries, including Brazil, India, Argentina and Turkey, to undergo a compulsory 10-day period of self-isolation, with a fine of €1,500 in the event of non-compliance. Germany on Saturday banned all travellers from Britain from entering its territory from midnight on 23 May from Sunday after designating the UK as a “virus variant area of concern”. German citizens and residents and their spouses and children are exempt from the measure, along with people travelling for urgent humanitarian reasons, but everyone arriving from the UK must now quarantine for two weeks. even if they test negative. The Associated Press has this dispatch from the Turkish city of Mardin, where so-called “vaccination persuasion” teams are working to promote inoculation against Covid among vulnerable people amid apparent reluctancy. In the medieval Turkish city of Mardin, Medine Ereli calls out to a team of medical workers walking along the town’s cobblestoned main street. Her 59-year old husband refuses to get vaccinated, she tells the doctor and nurse, before leading them to Enver Ereli, who’s on the job as a municipal sanitation worker. The mobile door-to-door units – equipped with coolers carrying vaccine vials – have been operational in several Turkish provinces since April. At local health offices, more government workers reach people by phone in an attempt to change their minds. Health minister Fahrettin Koca says 84% of the population age 65 and above who are eligible to be vaccinated have so far received Covid-19 shots. The government aims to bring that figure above 90%. In Mardin, the team talked Ereli into getting his shot and the nurse administered the first jab while he sat down on a nearby ledge. “I was afraid of getting sick and of being paralysed. But then the medical teams told me it was for my benefit and I believed them and got vaccinated,” Ereli said. A Belgian judge has begun hearing an urgent European Commission request for a court order requiring AstraZeneca to deliver millions more vaccines to the bloc, in a case that may reflect the EU’s anger more than its need for doses. The court, which will examine in a later case whether the Anglo-Swedish pharmaceuticals company broke its contract with the EU, heard the commission argue on Wednesday that an “urgent need” for the shots warranted an emergency order. AstraZeneca supplied only 30m of the 120m Covid-19 vaccine doses it was scheduled to deliver to the bloc by the end of March, and the commission says the company is on course to deliver 70m of a promised 180m in the second quarter. The commission’s lawyer, Rafaël Jafferali, told the court the company now expected to deliver the full 300m doses in its contract by the end of December, but added: “With a six-month delay, it’s obviously a failure.” Bahrain is to close shopping malls, restaurants and coffee shops for two weeks starting from tomorrow as part of efforts to contain the spread of the coronavirus, state TV reported. Beauty salons, spas and barber shops will also close and no event or conference should be held during this period, it said, citing the national committee to combat the pandemic, Reuters reports. China has accused the US of “spreading conspiracy theories and disinformation” as Anthony Fauci said he was no longer convinced the coronavirus originated naturally – propelling the theory that it emerged from a Wuhan laboratory back into mainstream debate. AFP reports: Led by the US, pressure is mounting for a new probe into the origins of Covid-19 after a World Health Organization (WHO) mission to China, beset by delays and dogged by political baggage, returned inconclusive findings. The Wuhan Institute of Virology has returned to the spotlight after a report in The Wall Street Journal, citing US intelligence, said three lab workers there were hospitalised in November 2019 with coronavirus-like symptoms, a month before the pandemic’s first declared case. The newspaper also said researchers had collected samples seven years earlier from a mine in southwestern China, where miners had contracted a mysterious illness from a new, bat-borne coronavirus. Repeating an earlier denial of the report, Zhao Lijian, spokesman for China’s foreign ministry, accused the US of “spreading conspiracy theories and disinformation such as a laboratory leak”. The theory that the killer virus leaked from a Chinese lab was originally fuelled by, among others, the administration of former US president Donald Trump. Zhao said it was “disrespectful” to the WHO probe to revive the theory, and risked an “undermining of global solidarity to fight the virus”. Fauci had said: “I am not convinced about that, I think we should continue to investigate what went on in China until we continue to find out to the best of our ability what happened. Certainly, the people who investigated it say it likely was the emergence from an animal reservoir that then infected individuals, but it could have been something else, and we need to find that out. So, you know, that’s the reason why I said I’m perfectly in favour of any investigation that looks into the origin of the virus.” Pakistan has opened up its vaccination campaign to everyone aged 19 or older as it moves to protect more of its 220 million people. Reuters reports: Pakistan has had to deal with vaccination hesitancy and a shortage of vaccine supplies and had limited shots to people aged 30 or over. But with purchases and donations from China and allocations from the World Health Organisation and the GAVI Vaccine Alliance, it has now secured more than 18 million doses and is keen to get them out into the population. “We decided to open up vaccination registration for all 19 years and above,” Asad Umar, minister in-charge of supervising anti-COVID operations, said in a post on Twitter. People can sign up from Thursday, he said. “So now registration will be open for the entire national population which is approved by health experts for Covid vaccination,” Umar said. Pakistan has reported more than 900,000 coronavirus infections and some 20,465 deaths. Today, authorities reported 2,724 new infections and 65 deaths in the previous 24 hours. Pakistan has administered 5.3 million vaccine doses with supplies from three Chinese companies - Sinopharm, Sinovac and CanSinbio - and the Oxford-AstraZeneca shots. UN humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock has called on warring parties to focus together on the true fight of our lives” against “a common enemy: Covid-19.” AP reports: While there were some positive responses to the pandemic, Lowcock said deadly conflicts continued and emerged or got worse including in Ethiopia, Mozambique and between Armenia and Azerbaijan, contributing to a rise in the number of people forcibly displaced in 2020. “At the same time, insecurity, sanctions, counter-terrorism measures and administrative hurdles hindered humanitarian operations,” he said, and the pandemic made aid deliveries more difficult because of suspended flights, border closures, quarantine measures and lockdowns. Lowcock noted “multiple reports of atrocities” against civilians caught in conflicts during the pandemic. “By the end of 2020, nearly 100 million people faced crisis or worse levels of acute food insecurity as a result of conflict,” he said. “That was up from 77 million the year before,” he said. Lowcock also cited the impact of conflicts on civilians in urban areas from explosive devices, on farmers from the destruction of agricultural land, and on entire populations from attacks on medical care. “Last year, attacks on health care across 22 conflict-affected countries killed 182 health workers,” with the highest numbers losing their lives in Burkina Faso, Congo, Somalia and Syria, he said. In a two-month period this year, Lowcock said, 109 violent incidents against health care were documented in Myanmar, where a military coup took place on 1 February, “accelerating the collapse in the public health-care system when many people needed it most.” Taiwan has accused China of hindering its efforts to obtain Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines from Germany amid a rise in coronavirus cases. Today, president Tsai Ing-wen explicitly accused China of being a stumbling block to getting Pfizer shots. “We had almost completed the contract-signing with the German manufacturer at one point but it has been delayed till now because China has interfered,” Tsai said in a post on her Facebook page. Back in February, Taiwanese officials hinted China was causing difficulties, but officials steered clear of explicitly naming Beijing, which works to keep the island diplomatically isolated. Tsai’s administration has not detailed why it believes China has been a stumbling block and Beijing has previously denied putting up roadblocks. Pfizer-BioNTech’s distributor for the Greater China region - which includes Taiwan - is Fosun Pharma based in Shanghai. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said “Taiwan’s access to vaccines from the mainland is smooth,” without elaborating further. “We don’t recognise this so-called president, she is only the leader of a region of China,” he added. Taiwan – population 23.5 million – has so far only received some 726,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine via the Covax global sharing scheme and from the manufacturer itself. Cases have swiftly risen to 6,000, while deaths have tripled to 46 after an outbreak among airline pilots spread. The government has since brought in strict social distancing restrictions, including closing public venues and schools, until 14 June. Indian doctors have questioned the free distribution of an ayurvedic medicine to Covid patients by the state of Haryana as the maker of the herbal concoction which has not undergone large clinical trials faced criticism. The news comes after the state of Goa announced it would give anti-parasitic drug Ivermectin to all adults due to claims, which have raised some eyebrows – not least at the World Health Organisation – that it may help combat the virus. Reuters has the full story: The northern state, which is ruled by prime minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janta Party, said this week it would hand out Coronil to Covid-19 patients. The ayurvedic medicine was launched by yoga guru Baba Ramdev’s company Patanjali Ayurved last year. The government later said the consumer goods company co-founded by Ramdev, who has a large following in India, could not market the drug as a cure, and it needed to market it as an immunity booster. There is no scientific basis to Coronil’s use in treating Covid-19 patients, said Ajay Khanna, the state secretary of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) in Uttarakhand, where Patanjali is headquartered. One small study suggests it could be effective, but experts have said further research would be required to support any such claims. Ayurveda is an ancient Indian system that includes medicines, meditation, exercise and dietary guidelines practiced by millions of adherents. Hungary has approved a bill essential to the green-lighting of EU’s recovery fund, bringing the bloc a step closer to putting the deal into operation. Reuters has the story: The 27 EU nations made an unprecedented agreement last year to jointly borrow €750 billion euros for the fund. But all 27 must ratify a decision to raise the upper limit for national contributions for the plan to go ahead. Until today, Hungary was one of a handful yet to do so. Nationalist prime minister Viktor Orban, who has been in power for over a decade, has often been at loggerheads with Brussels over curbs on independent media, academics, courts and NGOs, as well as his restrictive approach to migration. However, tens of billions of euros worth of funds flowing from the EU into Hungary have helped his government boost GDP growth and will continue to be crucial as the economy rebounds from last year’s recession. Orban has also used public spending to strengthen a loyal business elite, partly using billions of euros worth of EU funds. Hungary, the only EU country to have approved and deployed Russian and Chinese vaccines before the European Medicines Agency has approved them, has vaccinated over half of its 10 million citizens, and has reopened most the economy. Other EU states yet to sign off on the EU recovery fund deal are Romania, Austria and Poland. Hello to everyone reading, Mattha Busby here taking over. Do drop me a line on Twitter with any tips or thoughts. The European Medicines Agency will announce on Friday whether it has approved the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus jab for 12- to 15-year-olds, the regulator has said. If approved, it will be the first vaccine to get the green light for young people in the 27-nation European Union. The US and other countries have called for a more in-depth investigation of the pandemic origins, after an international mission to China earlier this year proved inconclusive. France has set up extra Covid testing centres after a cluster of around 50 people in Bordeaux were found to be positive with a new virus variant described by the regional health authority as “very rare”. India’s total coronavirus infections crossed 27 million on Wednesday, swelled by 208,921 new cases over the last 24 hours, while daily deaths from Covid-19 rose by 4,157 The Maldives will restrict movement to curb a surge in coronavirus infections that is putting pressure on the island’s healthcare facilities. Taiwan has reported its highest daily number of Covid-19 fatalities, with 11 deaths recorded on Tuesday, and tightened restrictions on the population. In Germany, the rate of infections continues to fall, reaching a seven-month low. AstraZeneca and Nipro Corp have signed an agreement to supply the British-Swedish company’s Covid-19 vaccine in Japan. The United Arab Emirates said vaccinations against Covid-19 will be mandatory for people attending all “live events” from 6 June. Easily the biggest news draw domestically at the moment on Covid is Dominic Cummings explaining what he thought were the failings of the UK government to prepare. You can follow that live with Andrew Sparrow here: I’ll be back tomorrow, Mattha Busby will be here shortly to lead you through the rest of the day’s global Covid news. The economic impact of Covid has not been evenly distributed in the US, as Alexandra Villarreal reports for us: Over the first two months of the health crisis, the number of active Black, Latino and Asian business owners plummeted by 41%, 32% and 26% respectively, versus just 17% for white entrepreneurs. That outsized toll has lasted well into 2021, when half of small and mid-sized minority-owned businesses couldn’t pay all of their April rent on time, according to a recent poll. And, even as the country reopens, more than a third of Black entrepreneurs say conditions are getting worse for their small businesses, while 37% fear “they may not survive the next three months”, a spring survey by Small Business Majority found. “We need to start thinking about the recovery – how we actually build back the minority-owned businesses that we lost,” said Carlos Fernando Avenancio-León, an assistant professor of finance at the University of California, San Diego. Many business people of color went into the pandemic already at a disadvantage, with lower annual revenues than their white counterparts and dismal access to funding opportunities. Black and Hispanic entrepreneurs are also less likely to have emergency savings tucked away, plus they have fewer stocks and other liquid assets to help them weather an economic downturn. Read more of Alexandra Villarreal’s report here: ‘Permanent damage’: can minority-owned businesses recover from pandemic’s toll? The European Medicines Agency will announce on Friday whether it has approved the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus jab for 12- to 15-year-olds, the regulator has said. AFP reports that if approved, it will be the first vaccine to get the green light for young people in the 27-nation European Union. Pfizer is currently authorised for people aged 16 and older. The EMA will give a briefing on Friday to “cover the outcome of the extraordinary meeting of EMA’s human medicine committee … to discuss the paediatric indication for Comirnaty”, it said in an email. Comirnaty is the brand name for the vaccine developed by US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and the German research firm BioNTech. The US Food and Drug Administration has already authorised Pfizer for 12- to 15-year-olds. EMA chief Emer Cooke said earlier this month that the Amsterdam-based watchdog was fast-tracking the approval for young people, which was originally expected in June. She told European newspapers on 11 May the regulator had received Pfizer-BioNTech data and “we’ve been promised data from clinical trials and the study carried out in Canada within the next two weeks, and we are going to speed up our evaluation”. Nectar Gan and James Griffiths at CNN have a little more on the information war being waged by China as there are growing calls for a more thorough investigation into the origins of the novel coronavirus. They write: After facing fierce attacks from Republicans, top US infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci now has a new critic: Chinese state media. “US elites degenerate further in morality, and Fauci is one of them,” was the headline of a blistering opinion piece penned by Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of the state-run Global Times this week. In the article, Hu accused the top US infectious disease expert of “fanning a huge lie against China” by hyping the theory that the coronavirus was leaked from a Wuhan lab. Another article in the Global Times declared that Fauci had “betrayed Chinese scientists.” The anger is centered on Fauci’s remarks this month that he is no longer convinced the Covid-19 pandemic originated naturally. “I think we should continue to investigate what went on in China until we continue to find out to the best of our ability what happened,” said the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at a fact-checking symposium on 11 May. Fauci’s comments were followed by a Wall Street Journal exclusive, citing a US intelligence report, that said three researchers from the Wuhan Institute of Virology became sick enough in November 2019 that they sought hospital care. Unsurprisingly, China has vehemently refuted the report. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said the report was “totally inconsistent with the facts” and a director at the lab called the report “a complete lie.” Read more here: CNN – Chinese state media is turning on Fauci amid Wuhan lab controversy The Maldives will restrict movement to curb a surge in coronavirus infections that is putting pressure on the island’s healthcare facilities, officials said. Tanvi Mehta reports for Reuters that people will be allowed out for a few hours each day for essential supplies and a strict curfew will be in place from 4pm to 8am the next day, the Health Protection Agency said. The restrictions come as the Indian Ocean island has seen a rise in cases and is struggling with a shortage of medical staff, many of whom come from India which is battling its own deadly wave of infections. “Especially due to the situation in India, which is traditionally the biggest source country, we are finding it difficult to hire new medical professionals to deal with the increased caseload,” Mabrook Azeez, the spokesman for the President’s Office told Reuters. The Maldives reported 1,004 fresh cases on Tuesday with a tally of 58,345 total infections, according to the health agency, with cases concentrated in the capital Male. Last week, daily cases hit a record 2,194, setting off alarm in the tropical island chain with a population of a little over half a million. President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih said the country had erred in lifting curbs on public movement. “The easing of restrictions in April was not right. I don’t think those decisions were good enough. However, I am not going to put that responsibility on anyone,” he told reporters. The country held local council elections in April during which public meetings were held. Family gatherings and congregation alto took place in mosques during the holy month of Ramadan. Andrew Sparrow has just launched our UK live blog for the day which you imagine will be wall-to-wall Dominic Cummings and how the UK government prepared – or didn’t – for the pandemic. I’ll be continuing here with leading international developments on the coronavirus. In Germany, the rate of infections continues to fall, reaching a seven-month low. The country’s disease control agency today reported 46.8 new infections per 100,000 people within the space of seven days, the incidence rate dropping below 50 for the first time since October. Overall, Germany only recorded 2,626 new infections on Tuesday, though a lag in reporting due to a bank holiday could also be a factor behind the latest drop in numbers. Leading coronavirus expert Christian Drosten has attributed the drop in numbers largely to lockdown measures in the spring and the progress of the vaccination campaign, arguing it was easy to overestimate the impact of the summery temperatures. “Once cannot assume that the temperatures will take care of this thing”, Drosten told broadcaster NDR. France has set up extra Covid testing centres after a cluster of around 50 people in Bordeaux were found to be positive with a new virus variant described by the regional health authority as “very rare”. Although the new strain has been called the “Bordeaux variant”, Prof Patrick Dehail, scientific and medical advisor to the local health authority, says it is actually a mutation of the B.1.1.7 first detected in Kent, known locally as the “English variant”. It has been picked up before now, but this is the first time it has created such a large cluster. Many of those who tested positive were students at a school in the Bacalan district of the city and their parents. None of them has been hospitalised and Dehail said they showed “the usual symptoms or no symptoms”. He added that all the vaccines being delivered in France – PfizerBioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca and Janssen – covered this variant. About 80% of all new Covid cases in France are the “English variant”, a more contagious variation of the original coronavirus. The UK’s health secretary Matt Hancock prioritising publicising vaccines rather than speculating about Dominic Cummings while out on his morning run here. AstraZeneca and Nipro Corp have signed an agreement to supply the British-Swedish company’s Covid-19 vaccine in Japan. Nipro said the contract was for filling the shot into vials and packaging it, due to start next month. Japan’s government has agreed to acquire 120m doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccine, enough for 60m people. The shot was officially approved in Japan on Friday along with the one developed by Moderna. Japan started its inoculation drive in mid-February, later than most major economies and using imported doses of the shot developed by Pfizer/BioNTech. The Moderna vaccine went into use this week with the opening of mass vaccination centres. But there are, Reuters report, no immediate plans to use AstraZeneca’s shot in Japan, amid lingering concerns raised internationally over blood clots. China’s official vaccination figures continue to dwarf the efforts of others. Reuters report that China administered about 19.5m Covid-19 vaccine doses on 25 May, bringing the total number of doses administered to 546m, according to data released by the National Health Commission on Wednesday. AFP has a despatch from Kinshasa, capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, this morning, where it says residents are still banking on “God’s protection” from Covid. When the coronavirus arrived from Europe in sub-Saharan Africa’s second largest city in March 2020, residents feared the worst. “Covid should have devastated us. But so far, we have been spared,” said Aimee Rugambo, a nurse at a government Covid treatment centre at Vijana hospital. “God is in control! He protected us.” But she added: “We must tell people that Covid exists. It is in Kinshasa, and it kills.” Official national figures show 30,862 cases since March 2020, the vast majority in Kinshasa (21,284), and 779 deaths. The figure, if credible, is negligible in a gigantic country that has suffered war and suffering for the past three decades. “We will never know the number of infected or dead from corona – most are not tested,” a Congolese journalist noted. “It’s too complicated or too expensive.” Grappling with so many other scourges on a daily basis, “you only go to the hospital if you are seriously ill”, he said. Vaccination is free and open to all, but the campaign is not taking off. Last weekend, only 11,000 people were reported vaccinated in Kinshasa, of a national total of 14,434. “People are sceptical,” lamented Wamba Nice, director of the Vijana hospital. “Many are afraid, mainly because of the rumours on social networks.” Only two people showed up for the jab at the Vijana treatment centre, both from the Indian subcontinent, who declined to speak. The day before, no one came, but for now it is mainly foreigners who are benefiting from it. “Few people come … it’s a shame,” Dr Nice said, fearing that some doses will have to be destroyed because they have gone beyond their expiry date. Both Conservative transport minister Grant Shapps and Labour’s shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy have been on BBC Breakfast this morning in the UK. Of Dominic Cummings, Nandy said: What will be important today is whether Dominic Cummings comes armed with evidence. Either the prime minister is lying, or the prime minister has appointed someone to one of the most senior positions in government who himself is a liar, who made key decisions about Covid and who the prime minister stood by, even when he broke the lockdown rules himself. Either way, this does not reflect well on the prime minister’s judgment or his character. Shapps wasn’t particularly flattering either, according to PA Media. Asked whether Cummings was a “trusted adviser”, Shapps said: “He was certainly an adviser of the government. It’s for others to decide the trusted part of it.” Shapps also accepted that Cummings’ actions last year had damaged the government’s messaging on Covid restrictions. He said: “I accept it was a moment which actually in the public’s mind undermined the wider messages and I accept that.” Taiwan has reported its highest daily number of Covid-19 fatalities, with 11 deaths recorded on Tuesday, and tightened restrictions on the population. All fatalities were people aged over 50, with nine connected to the Wanhua cluster in Taipei city. At a press conference a short time ago, the central epidemic command centre also reported an uptick in daily case numbers, as well as hundreds more positive cases from the past few weeks discovered as they process a backlog of test results. There were 302 new local cases reported today, and 333 added to previous days’ totals. While cases are now in every county, the vast majority of the new cases and all but eight of the delayed cases are in the northern cities of Taipei and New Taipei. The updated figures for the past week show daily figures peaked on 17 May with 526 cases. It also revealed delays are still significantly affecting current reporting, with 92 new cases added to yesterday’s total. Health and welfare minister Chen Chih-Shung said the level 3 alert restricting people’s social movements had been effective but needed to be tighter in light of the continuing daily case cases. He said all restaurants must now offer takeaway only (a rule already enforced by several city governments), and all wedding, funerals and religious services were cancelled. He also pledged tougher enforcement and punishment for people not wearing masks outside, and recreation businesses operating when they’d been told to close. Asked about continuing suggestions from health experts that tighter restrictions or lockdowns were necessary to control the outbreak, Chen said they wanted to prevent “Covid fatigue” “Secondly, it is too costly for our economy to halt all activities. What I can say is that we have been working closely with the Ministry of Economic Affairs to provide a smooth base of operation for crucial industries,” he said. Transport minister Grant Shapps is the man out and about on the UK media this morning fronting up the government’s pre-damage limitation operation ahead of Dominic Cummings’ appearance this morning – that session starts at 9.30am by the way. You can expect a steady drip, drip, drip of quotes from Shapps this morning as he goes round TV and radio studios. Already he has dismissed it as a “sideshow”. PA Media notes that on Sky News, Shapps has said “I’ll leave others to determine how reliable a witness to all this he is. He was there at the time, what his motives would be I will leave to others.” Shapps definitely appeared to think Cummings was a credible and reliable witness this time last year. After weeks of slow bookings at the mass vaccination hubs in Melbourne, Australia, there were long queues outside the two hubs in the CBD on Wednesday as the city faced yet another Covid-19 outbreak and the prospect of more restrictions. For weeks the mass vaccination hub at the Royal Exhibition Building in Carlton had been relatively idle, with few of those in the eligible phases, such as those over the age of 50, turning up to get the AstraZeneca vaccine. But a day after Victoria recorded six new Covid cases in Melbourne’s northern suburbs linked to a man who caught the infection from hotel quarantine in South Australia, the queue was stretching down the side of the building, with about 100 people waiting by mid-morning. “I assume a lot more people turned up today because of what’s going on in Melbourne,” said Nick, who waited in the queue for his jab for 40 minutes past his appointment time. “I actually live nearby, and I come around here quite often, and it’s been quite empty … but it seems like people are getting fired up a bit, which is good.” Read more of Josh Taylor’s report here: Melbourne’s vaccination hubs see long queues as city responds to Covid outbreak Right now now on the NHS England website it looks like you qualify to book a jab if you are: aged 30 and over will turn 30 before 1 July 2021 That’s in addition to the other categories: people at high risk from Covid-19 (clinically extremely vulnerable) people who live or work in care homes health and social care workers people with a condition that puts them at higher risk (clinically vulnerable) people with a learning disability people who are a main carer for someone at high risk from Covid-19 You can book your shot here.

Our political correspondent Aubrey Allegretti writes: On the eve of the evidence session, Cummings continued to add to a 63-tweet long thread on Twitter, claiming one of the “worst failings” last year was the “almost total absence of a serious plan for shielding/social care” and adding: “There was widespread delusion we HAD a great plan. It turned out to barely exist.” He also hinted he plans to shine a light on an alleged but firmly denied government strategy of “herd immunity”, meaning enough people gaining resistance to a virus that it no longer spreads unchecked. He has also promised to provide a “crucial” document on Covid decision-making to the health and science committees chaired by two Tory MPs, Jeremy Hunt and Greg Clark. Whether the public will pay as much heed to a man whose pandemic contribution will mainly be remembered for his flight from London during lockdown remains to be seen.

Here’s some news that may significantly alter life for tourists and the attractiveness of business hub Dubai – the United Arab Emirates said vaccinations against Covid-19 will be mandatory for people attending all “live events” from 6 June. The policy applies to all sports, cultural, social, arts exhibition, activities and events, a spokeswoman for the ministry of health said late on Tuesday. Attendees must also present a negative Covid-19 PCR test taken at least 48 hours before the event. The policy also appears to apply for weddings of up to 100 people. Reuters report that the country’s vaccination campaign has consistently been one of the fastest in the world and the UAE said more than 78.11% of the eligible population over 16 years old had now been vaccinated. It wasn’t specified if this was one or two doses. That’s it from me, Helen Sullivan, for today. Thanks for following along – and stay tuned for more updates from my esteemed colleague Martin Belam. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 2,626 to 3,656,177, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Wednesday. The reported death toll rose by 270 to 87,726, the tally showed. Lockdowns in some of the world’s poorest countries have seen schools close, households lose their incomes, and, in some cases, a growth in domestic abuse. The result, according to a report, has been a rise in child labour, as children like Gopal have found themselves in often precarious and exploitative work, with long hours, low pay, and scant regard for safety. Jo Becker, director at Human Rights Watch (HRW), which co-published the report with the Initiative for Social and Economic Rights in Uganda and Friends of the Nation in Ghana, said: “The key driver is the economic situation that so many families are facing because they have lost jobs, they have lost income. The lockdowns in many countries have really dealt a blow.” The Guardian’s Lizzy Davies and Pete Pattisson report: India’s total coronavirus infections crossed 27 million on Wednesday, swelled by 208,921 new cases over the last 24 hours, while daily deaths from Covid-19 rose by 4,157, Reuters reports. The South Asian country’s overall caseload is now at 27.16 million, while total fatalities are at 311,388, according to health ministry data. The US and other countries have called for a more in-depth investigation of the pandemic origins, after an international mission to China earlier this year proved inconclusive. Addressing the World Health Organization’s main annual meeting of member states in Geneva, representatives from several countries stressed the continued need to solve the mystery of how Covid-19 first began spreading among humans. “We underscore the importance of a robust comprehensive and expert-led inquiry into the origins of Covid-19,” US representative Jeremy Konyndyk told the meeting on Tuesday. Australia, Japan and Portugal were among other countries to call for more progress on the investigation, while the British representative urged for any probe to be “timely, expert-driven and grounded in robust science”. Determining how the virus that causes Covid-19 began spreading is seen as vital to preventing future outbreaks: The coronavirus variant first detected in India has now been officially recorded in 53 territories, a World Health Organization report showed Wednesday, AFP reports. Additionally, the WHO has received information from unofficial sources that the B.1.617 variant has been found in seven other territories, figures in the UN health agency’s weekly epidemiological update showed, taking the total to 60. The report said B.1.617 had shown increased transmissibility, while disease severity and risk of infection were under investigation. Globally over the past week, the number of new cases and deaths continued to decrease, with around 4.1 million new cases and 84,000 new deaths reported - a 14 percent and two percent decrease respectively compared to the previous week. The WHO’s European region reported the largest decline in new cases and deaths in the past seven days, followed by the southeast Asia region. The numbers of cases reported by the Americas, Eastern Mediterranean, Africa, and the Western Pacific region were similar to those reported in the previous week. “Despite a declining global trend over the past four weeks, incidence of Covid-19 cases and deaths remain high, and substantial increases have been observed in many countries throughout the world,” the document said. Hello and welcome to today’s live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. The coronavirus variant first detected in India has now been officially recorded in 53 territories, a World Health Organization report showed Wednesday. Additionally, the WHO has received information from unofficial sources that the B.1.617 variant has been found in seven other territories, figures in the UN health agency’s weekly epidemiological update showed, taking the total to 60. Meanwhile the United States and other countries have called for a more in-depth investigation of the pandemic origins, after an international mission to China earlier this year proved inconclusive. Here are the other key recent developments: At least 77,000 hospital staff in England caught coronavirus during the pandemic, while there were nearly a quarter of a million absences for Covid-related reasons, Guardian research has revealed. The number of people with Covid-19 in intensive care units in France fell by another 49 to 3,447 on Tuesday, while the overall number of people in hospital with the virus fell by 271 to 19,430. The Biden administration has reaffirmed its support for Tokyo’s plan to hold the Olympic Games this summer despite a new wave of coronavirus cases and the US urging its citizens to avoid all travel to Japan. Poland will launch a lottery with prizes of as much as 1m zlotys ($273,000) to encourage people to get vaccinated against Covid-19, the minister in charge of the immunisation programme has said. UK trade with the EU collapsed by nearly a quarter at the start of 2021 compared with three years before as Brexit and Covid-19 disruption hit exports, while China replaced Germany as the biggest single import market, according to official figures.","charCount":"53920","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/damien-gayle\">Damien Gayle</a> (now); <a href=\"profile/mattha-busby\">Mattha Busby</a>, <a href=\"profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a>  and <a href=\"profile/helen-sullivan\">Helen Sullivan</a> (earlier)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/live/2021/may/26/uk-covid-news-live-dominic-cummings-boris-johnson-covid-evidence-pmqs","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-26T16:32:21Z","webTitle":"Dominic Cummings says Boris Johnson was ‘unfit for the job’ of PM during Covid crisis – live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2021/may/26/uk-covid-news-live-dominic-cummings-boris-johnson-covid-evidence-pmqs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/live/2021/may/26/uk-covid-news-live-dominic-cummings-boris-johnson-covid-evidence-pmqs","fields":{"headline":"Dominic Cummings says Boris Johnson was ‘unfit for the job’ of PM during Covid crisis – live","standfirst":"<p>PM’s former adviser says he heard Boris Johnson say <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2021/may/26/uk-covid-news-live-dominic-cummings-boris-johnson-covid-evidence-pmqs?page=with:block-60ae59dc8f088d8c31789cd1#block-60ae59dc8f088d8c31789cd1\">he would rather see ‘bodies piled high’</a> than order lockdown in autumn and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2021/may/26/uk-covid-news-live-dominic-cummings-boris-johnson-covid-evidence-pmqs?page=with:block-60ae428d8f088d8c31789b26#block-60ae428d8f088d8c31789b26\">admits Durham trip was disaster</a></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/may/26/dominic-cummings-covid-chaos-no-10-like-out-of-control-movie-boris-johnson\">Thousands died who didn’t need to, Cummings tells MPs</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/may/26/covid-bereaved-react-to-dominic-cummings-evidence\">‘Upsetting and bleak’: Covid bereaved react to Cummings evidence</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/may/26/dominic-cummings-says-he-did-not-tell-whole-truth-about-journeys-to-durham-barnard-castle\">Cummings says he did not tell whole truth about journeys to Durham</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/may/26/matt-hancock-should-be-sacked-for-lying-says-dominic-cummings\">Matt Hancock should be sacked for lying, says Dominic Cummings</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/may/26/uk-government-failed-public-on-covid-response-says-dominic-cummings\">UK government failed public on Covid response, says Cummings</a><br></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/may/26/dominic-cummings-evidence-to-mps-on-covid-crisis-fact-checked\">Fact-checked: Dominic Cummings’ evidence to MPs on Covid crisis</a></li></ul>","trailText":"PM’s former adviser says he heard Boris Johnson say he would rather see ‘bodies piled high’ than order lockdown in autumn and admits Durham trip was disaster","byline":"Andrew Sparrow","main":"<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"c751b094-8e87-4dda-b502-5262cf4c92c3\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8LFS3FaRs_s?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>","body":"<div id=\"block-60ae76b18f08d486a7713d71\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-05-26T16:28:52.364Z\">5.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Jeremy Hunt</strong>, chair of the health committee, and <strong>Greg Clark</strong>, chair of the science committee, has said their joint inquiry into coronavirus may publish documents from Dominic Cummings following the hearing today.

Wickham writes:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The revealing messages were last night circulating throughout Whitehall and call into question Cummings’ current claims to have sought transparency and honesty while, he alleges, government ministers “lied” about herd immunity. The WhatsApps clearly show that, at the beginning of the pandemic in March last year, Cummings directly told his colleagues to publicly deny herd immunity was the government’s policy, and instead agreed they should argue it was a secondary long-term effect of the “mitigation” policy pursued by the government at the start of the crisis.</p> \n   <p>Cummings’ direct order to ministers to deny that herd immunity was their policy could mean one of two things: That herd immunity either never was the government’s main strategy, meaning his tweets over the past few days are wrong, or that it was but he nonetheless instructed ministers to lie, detonating his supposed claims to be pursuing transparency and seriously undermining his credibility ahead of today’s select committee appearance. If Cummings’ tweets of the past few days are to be believed, these messages show he was guilty of the exact thing he is now accusing ministers of doing.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This should come as no great surprise. Downing Street has always denied that “herd immunity” was its strategy - even though Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser, said the opposite in a TV interview - and at the time the No 10 head of communications, Lee Cain, was effectively under Cummings’ line management, so Cummings must at least have acquiesced in the denials.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-60ae00e68f08d486a771357b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-05-26T08:13:16.204Z\">9.13am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Rather than saving up all his anti-Johnson allegations for the hearing, Dominic Cummings seems to have been briefing them out liberally all week - a bit like the Treasury ahead of a budget.

Cummings said that he would provide the MPs with evidence to back up his claims about Matt Hancock being a liar. Hunt and Clark said: As part of our joint parliamentary inquiry into lessons learnt from the Government’s response to the pandemic, it has been important to hear about decisions taken by Downing Street at the outset to deal with the threat from Covid-19. We will review the evidence given by Dominic Cummings today and will publish relevant documents we accept as evidence in due course. Matt Hancock will appear before us next month when we will have a further opportunity to explore steps taken by ministers and the outcomes. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has issued a generalised statement rejecting Dominic Cummings claims about him. A spokesman for Hancock said: At all times throughout this pandemic the secretary of state for health and social care and everyone in DHSC has worked incredibly hard in unprecedented circumstances to protect the NHS and save lives. We absolutely reject Mr. Cummings’ claims about the health secretary. The health secretary will continue to work closely with the prime minister to deliver the vaccine rollout, tackle the risks posed by variants and support the NHS and social care sector to recover from this pandemic. This statement does not address the specifics of the multiple allegations against Hancock (eg, see 11.04am, 12.27pm, or 1.06pm). But it is understood that Hancock will take the No 10 press conference tomorrow where he will be able to address these points in detail. Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, is also saying what was said by Dominic Cummings strengthens the case for the inquiry starting early. Boris Johnson has said the inquiry will start next spring (although he has not defined what he means by starting, and whether this means public evidence sessions will begin then). Sir Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, says Dominic Cummings’ evidence reinforces the need for the Covid public inquiry to start immediately.

Matt Hancock, the health secretary, will have a chance to respond to what Dominic Cummings has said about him in the Commons tomorrow, because Labour has tabled an urgent question for him. Greg Clark goes again. Q: Do you accept from the evidence you should have done more to promote the case you became convinced of earlier? Cummings accepts that. Q: You edited your blog to make it look better in hindsight. Is that what you are doing here? Cummings does not accept what Clark says about his blog. He says it was outsiders who alerted him to the problems. He sought advice from outsiders. But the media then criticised him for trying to influence Sage. He says his sense was that the system was failing. Clark thanks Cummings for being very generous with his time. Matt Hancock will be giving evidence two weeks tomorrow, he says. After that the two committees will reflect and publish their report. And that’s it. That lasted just over seven hours. I will be posting reaction and analysis. A summary would probably take another seven hours, but there are already extensive news reports on our website, plus analysis. You will find them all here. Jeremy Hunt gets his own final question. Q: It was not until 11 March that you advised the PM to change course. It took time to set up test and trace. And you did not win the argument on the timing of the second lockdown. Did you do your job properly? Cummings says there are many thousands of people in the country who could do the job better than him. Greg Clark says it is time to conclude. But he has some final questions (often the best ones). Q: What are he key lessons we should learn? Cummings says scientific advice should be more open. There is an obvious question about responsibility, he says. He says normally the division of responsibility works. But that won’t work with a big challenge like this. He says the Whitehall policy of diffusing responsibility is “intrinsically hostile to high performance management”. He says 99% of civil service jobs should be open by default. There are so many brilliant people in this country. But the civil service only recruits internally. It’s “crackers”, he says. The system should be open, so we can get the best people into the best jobs. He says he knows many senior people agree with him. But parts of Whitehall will fight this to the death. And his other recommendation is to think hard about incentives. People are not incentivised to tell the truth, or to think through hard problems, or to deliver. Instead people are incentivised to keep their heads down. He says people who are good at delivery are not rewarded. Here is some comment from journalists and commentators on what Dominic Cummings has been saying about Rishi Sunak. From the FT’s Robert Shrimsley From the New Statesman’s Jeremy Cliffe From Sam Feedman, a former government policy adviser Q: You spoke about people saying the UK could not follow Asian countries because “Asians all do what they’re told, so it won’t work here.” Who said that and who was promoting that outdated racist stereotype? Sarah Owen, who asks this, is British Chinese. Cummings says he does not want to reveal private conversations. But he says there is a problem with the UK’s refusal to learn from other countries. Q: Is Boris Johnson a fit and proper person to get us through this? No, says Cummings. Q: Some people will be thinking you are betting on a Rishi Sunak administration? Cummings says everyone, including his wife, thinks the less everyone hears from him in the future, the better. Q: You have been very supportive of Rishi Sunak, the chancellor. Cummings says there were powerful voices in the Treasury who were worried about the first lockdown. But he says the chancellor never tried to stop it. He says he does not remember it being discussed in cabinet. Or it was not discussed in a meaningful way. They were Potemkin meetings, he says. He did not attend meetings because he had better things to do. Q: Is Michael Gove culpable in any of the procurement chaos? (In the past Gove and Cummings were very close. Cummings worked for him as an adviser when Gove was eduction secretary.) Cummings says he does not think Gove played a major role. The Cabinet Office was not responsible for procurement. Sarah Owen (Lab) goes next. Q: Will you publish the evidence you have to back up claims that Matt Hancock lied? Cummings says he will think about it. But he says he is wary of publishing private messages. Greg Clark says, if Cummings has accused someone of lying, he should publish the evidence. Owen suggests Cummings could just share his evidence with the committee. Cummings says he will take some advice on this. Cummings says he was tempted to resign last summer. But various people said he should stay because Covid was going to get worse in the autumn. He says people said he should try to stay “to control the shopping trolley [Boris Johnson]”. This is from Nick Boles, the former Conservative MP. Cummings says Boris Johnson was told he should keep Matt Hancock as health secretary so that he could sack him when the public inquiry happened. He says his own view was that waiting was a mistake, because keeping Hancock in place would give him more time to mess things up. UPDATE: Cummings said: It’s definitely the case that the prime minister was told that, contrary to my view ... I said sack him, I said sack him almost every week, sometimes almost every day. He was told though that you should not sack him, you should keep him there because he’s the person you fire when an inquiry comes along. My counterargument to that was if you leave him there we’re going to have another set of disasters in the autumn, and that’s the critical thing. Cummings says Dominic Raab has not got enough credit for how he handled the situation when Boris Johnson was ill. He says he also thinks Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, did a brilliant job. Paul Bristow (Con) asks about a social media post saying Cummings is a “disingenuous little fucker” because the main reason for his decision to leave Downing Street was his failure to get his allies into key positions. Cummings does not accept that. He says he works well with some people, and has built teams. He says much of what is said in him about the media is not true. Cummings says in late September he should have told Johnson that if Johnson did not order a lockdown, he would resign and hold a press conference and say the decision was going to cost thousands of lives. He says he does not know if this would have worked. But he apologises for not trying. Cummings says his decision to quit No 10 was linked to Carrie Symonds, the PM’s partner, trying to change various Downing Street appointments. In particular, he says she was trying to change the outcome of one official hiring process in a way that was “completely unethical”. But he says his relationship with the PM had deteriorated. “Fundamentally I regarded him as unfit for the job,” says Cummings. UPDATE: Cummings said: My resignation was definitely connected to the fact that the prime minister’s girlfriend was trying to change a whole bunch of different appointments at Number 10 and appoint her friends to particular jobs. In particular she was trying to overturn the outcome of an official process about hiring a particular job in a way which was not only completely unethical but was also clearly illegal. I thought the whole process about how the prime minister was behaving at that point was appalling and all that was definitely part of why I went. These are from the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group, which has been campaign for a public inquiry to start now. This is what Downing Street said earlier about the claim that Boris Johnson proposed getting injected with coronavirus live on TV. (See 9.55am.) Asked if this was true, the PM’s spokesperson told journalists at the lobby briefing: I don’t plan to get into various allegations and claims that have been made today, our focus is on recovering from the pandemic, moving through the road map and distributing the vaccines. Cummings says he was not surprised that the government delayed putting India on the red list. Carol Monaghan (SNP) asks how a previous PM would have dealt with this. Cummings says if you took “anybody at random from the kind of top 1% competent people in this country” they would do things differently. Q: Was it arrogance or complacency? Cummings says Boris Johnson is misunderstood. People think that after he fell ill, he took it more seriously. But he thought that the first lockdown was a mistake. And he thought he had been gamed into ordering it. There’s a great misunderstanding people have that because it nearly killed him therefore he must’ve taken it seriously. But in fact after the first lockdown his view was ... he was cross with me and for others with what he regarded as basically pushing him into the first lockdown. His argument after that happened was, literally quote, ‘I should’ve been the mayor of Jaws and keep the beaches open’. That’s what he said on many, many occasions. He didn’t think in July or September, thank goodness we did the first lockdown, it was obviously the right thing to do, etc, etc. His argument then was we shouldn’t have done the first lockdown and I’m not going to make the same mistake again. He also essentially thought that he’d been gamed on the numbers in the first lockdown and thought the NHS would somehow have got through. Q: Did you hear him say that he would rather see the bodies pile high than order another lockdown? Cummings says there are different versions of this. There was a version in the Sunday Times that was not correct. But he says the BBC version was correct. He says: “I heard that in the PM’s study.” He says this was at a different point. This was on 31 October. Here is the BBC version of the story. And this is how it starts: Boris Johnson said he would rather see “bodies pile high” than take the country into a third lockdown, sources familiar with the conversations have told the BBC. The remarks were said to have been made last autumn, just as England went into a second lockdown. This piece of evidence from Cummings is important because Johnson specifically denied saying this, or anything to this effect, in the House of Commons. Cummings is the first on-the-record witness to contradict him. Cummings says all credible people, in his opinion, were pushing for a lockdown at this point. But the PM was just taking his own advice. He says the cabinet was not asked. He says he has been very critical of Matt Hancock, but Hancock agreed with Cummings at this point. The hearing is now resuming. The next session will focus on what happened in the autumn, ahead of the second lockdown. Dominic Cummings says Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser, advised a short, sharp lockdown. The PM refused to agree to that. But eventually the government did lock down, at the end of October. He says Vallance and Prof Chris Whitty, England’s chief medical officer, came to No 10 proposing a lockdown lasting two weeks or more. He says Whitty had said previously that, once schools went back in September, R, the reproduction number, would rise above 1. He says over the summer he and others had told the PM not to tell everyone to go back to work. But the PM’s priority was the economy. He says there was a long discussion on a Friday near the end of September when the PM said no. Cummings proposed a meeting on Monday 21 September, looking at the predictions for what the data would say at the end of October. But he says by this stage the PM was listening to people saying there was already herd immunity in the population. He says Vallance and Whitty gave their views. Prof Carl Heneghan and Prof Sunetra Gupta, both from Oxford and both sceptical about lockdown, spoke. And Prof John Edmunds from Sage spoke too. Edmunds said they should learn the lessons from March. But Cummings says the PM still was not convinced by the need for the lockdown. As my colleague Claire Phipps points out, Dominic Cummings did mention threats to his family as one of the reasons for his lockdown-busting trip to Durham last year - contrary to what he implied earlier. He is an extract from what Cummings said at his Rose Garden press conference last year. At the Downing Street lobby briefing the prime minister’s spokesperson refused to deny the claim that Boris Johnson considered sacking Matt Hancock in April last year. (See 12.51pm.) Asked about the claim, he said: I don’t plan to get into every allegation or claim made today. At all times the prime minister and the health and care secretary have been working closely to protect public health during the pandemic. That’s been the case throughout and continues to be so. Asked if the PM still has confidence in Hancock, the spokesperson said: Yes, the health secretary has been working closely with the prime minister throughout and has been fully focused on protecting the health and care system and saving lives. Jeremy Hunt has now adjourned the evidence session until 3.05pm. He says they have one more theme to cover - what happened in September, ahead of the second lockdown. This is the topic on which Cummings’s evidence may be the most damning. This is from Yvette Cooper, the Labour MP who chairs the Commons home affairs committee, on what Cummings said about border policy. (See 1.12pm.) James Davies (Con) starts his questioning by saying Cummings is now into his sixth hour of evidence. Q: Are there lessons to be learnt from how well the vaccine taskforce worked. Cummings says the key thing is that people knew who was responsible. The taskforce was simple. Kate Bingham picked a good team. This is from the Labour MP Barbara Keeley, who questioned Cummings about care homes earlier. (See 1.23pm.) Cummings says he has heard from people still in government that the vaccine programme is not working so effectively now because Kate Bingham is no longer involved. Cummings says the companies making mRNA vaccines could create them in hours. He says human challenge trials should have been set up much more quickly to test them. I’ve been beefing up some of the earlier posts with direct quotes from Cummings’ evidence. To get the updates to appear, you may need to refresh the page. Cummings says at one point the Department for Health was about to sign a “duff contract” on AstraZeneca that would not have given the government rights. He credits Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser, for blocking this. Sultana is now asking about contracts to Tory donors. Cummings says early on he was concerned that the procurement system was too slow. He says there needs to be a legal, proper fast-track process. He says people like him were saying the government should just requisition planes from airline and fly them to China to get PPE. But no one know if that was legal, or if the government would be sued. He says a system should be in place so that, in an emergency, the government could just press the panic button, and activate systems like this. Q: Do you support calls for a statutory, judge-led inquiry? Cummings says it does not necessarily need to be headed by a judge. But he says he wants a statutory inquiry, starting before next speaking. He says “tens of thousands of people died who didn’t need to die”. There is no excuse for delaying, he says. UPDATE: Cummings said: Tens of thousands of people died who didn’t need to die. There is absolutely no excuse for delaying that because a lot of the reasons for why that happened are still in place now. Look at the whole debate about variants and whatnot - this has to be honestly explained. If No 10 today won’t tell the truth about the official plan which they briefed the media about and described on TV a year ago, what on earth else is going on in there now? ... There is absolutely no excuse for a delay and the longer it is delayed, the more people will rewrite memories, the more documents will go astray, the more the whole thing will just become cancerous. Labour’s Zarah Sultana goes next. Q: Did the PM acknowledge that the herd immunity plan could lead to 500,000 deaths. Was he okay with that? Cummings says the possible death tolls were revealed on the documents that he tweeted out earlier this week. But this option was clearly intolerable, he says. Cummings says in March he started getting calls from people who said mRNA vaccines could smash the conventional wisdom (and deliver a vaccine more quickly). He says Sir Patrick Vallance backed this approach, and taking it out of the Department for Health. And Boris Johnson agreed this “in 90 seconds”, he says. Hunt says, having focused on what went wrong, they now want to ask about what was successful - the vaccine programme. Why did it go so well? Cummings says Kate Bingham, who has in charge of the vaccine taskforce, had clear responsibility. And she had the “strength of character” not to be pushed around. And she reported directly to the PM, not to the Department for Health. Jeremy Hunt says people find Cummings’ story about going to Barnard Castle to check his eyes implausible. Cummings says, if he were to invent a story, he would have invented a better one. A few days before that trip he was in bed writing his will because he thought he might die. Q: But if you were testing your eyesight, wasn’t it odd to take your wife and child in the car? Cummings says it did not feel crazy at the time. He was just driving down the road to see how it went. UPDATE: Cummings said: If I was going to make up a story I would have come up with a hell of a lot better one than that one right? It’s such a weird story. The truth is only a few days before then I had been sitting in bed writing a will, what to do if I die. I tried to explain this all at the time, it seemed to me like, okay if you’re going to drive 300 miles to go back to work the next day then pottering down the road for 30 miles and back to see how you feel after you have come off what you thought might be your death bed didn’t seem crazy to me at the time. Cummings says the real problem was the the PM would not come up with a policy and stick to it. He was changing his mind every time the Daily Telegraph wrote a leader on the subject. He was “just like a shopping trolley smashing from one side of the aisle to the other”. Cummings says although he was probably right not to resign in March last year, he was “definitely wrong” not to resign in September. He says the press may have under-estimated his influence between July and December 2019. But after that they “massively exaggerated” his influence, he says. If I could have clicked my fingers and done things, there would have been a serious border policy, masks would have been compulsory, Hancock would have been fired, we’d have done dozens and dozens and dozens of things. He says the problems was that he and Boris Johnson just fundamentally disagreed on Covid. Fundamentally the prime minister and I do not agree about Covid. After March he thought that the lesson to be learned is we shouldn’t have done a lockdown, we should have focused on the economy, it was all a disaster, ‘I should have been the mayor in Jaws’. I thought that perspective was completely mad. I had very little influence on Covid stuff, I mean I tried, I made arguments, but as you can see on pretty much all the major arguments I basically lost. And the PM’s girlfriend, Carrie Symonds, was “desperate to get rid of me”, Cummings says. Q: Why did you not reveal your concerns about Covid policy to the media? Cummings says it was because he wanted to change policy within government. James Davies (Con) is asking the questions now. Q: Why did you not apologise last year? Cummings says there were multiple things going on. He says he thinks his behaviour was “perfectly reasonable”. So that is why he did not want to apologise. He did not see it as a mistake. But he was only telling part of the story. It was a complete disaster. He says the security problems recurred. He says twice more he had to move his family out of the house. He says the story about him returning to Durham again is false. But he says his family did move out. He discussed that with the police, he says. Q: Why has it taken you this long to explain this? Cummings says he does understand people’s anger about this. He says his own uncle died in hospital with Covid around this time. Q: Why were you targeted so much by the media? Cummings says he has never complained about the media, or threatened to sue them. But if you have said as many critical things about the media as he has, then they will criticise you. He says he also wanted to change the way No 10 deals with the media. He says Downing Street traditionally operated as a “press answering service”. He says the PM was happy with that. But Cummings says he wanted to change that, and diminish the importance of the media. Jeremy Hunt says threats are totally unacceptable. But one thing he did not understand. If he moved his family out of London for security reasons, why did he move them back? Cummings says he was very ill. He thought he might die. If it was up to him, he would have left his family in Durham. But he was quite ill, and his wife was worried about what might happen if he collapsed alone in the house. He says he was under pressure to return to work because the government was in free fall. His wife insisted on returning to London with him. Evans asks about Cummings’ trip to Durham, and Barnard Castle. Cummings says there is information about this not in the public domain. He says in the autumn of 2019 he had to leave home for a few weeks because he was receiving threats. And he says there was another incident when his wife was in the house alone, and there were people outside making threats. He says that at that point he discussed this with officials in government, and he agreed to move his family out of London. After it emerged that he had left London, he had to hold the press conference. He says he made a terrible mistake. He decided it was best not to discuss the security issues affecting his decision to leave London because he thought that would just make the situation worse. He says that this was a mistake. This is from Prof Christina Pagel, head of the clinical operational research unit at University College London and a member of Independent Sage, an expert group that has been making Covid recommendations as an alternative to the official Sage. Luke Evans (Con) is asking the questions now. Q: How would you rate government communications in this? Cummings says some of the best people in the world were working on communications. The problems were “bad policy, bad decisions, bad planning, bad operational capability”. He goes on: It doesn’t matter if you’ve got great people doing communications. If the prime minister changes his mind 10 times a day, and then calls up the media and contradicts his own policy, day after day after day, you’re going to have communications disasters. As an example, he says Boris Johnson was warned by his head of communications, Lee Cain, not to pick a fight with Marcus Rashford over school meals. But Johnson ignored that advice, and had to back down twice. Q: It has been reported that the PM said he was not worried about the pandemic because it was only killing 80-year-olds. Cummings says it is clear there was no proper plan for care homes. It was catastrophic. Like all of these things, it was not deliberate. It was a function of the fact that the system was just completely overwhelmed. On the point about 80-year-olds (see 12.12pm), he says this was an issue in September. The hearing will get on to September later. Barbara Keeley (Lab) is asking the questions now. Q: Why was there no plan to protect people in care homes? Cummings says they were told in No 10 that people would be tested before being sent back to care homes and they were told there was a shielding plan. Neither of those things was correct. He says some people from the Cabinet Office, the government digital service and the communities department then got together to get the government data systems to talk to each other, so that they could produce a plan for shielding. Q: What about social care? It was reported that in February you described the government’s plans as herd immunity, protecting the economy, and it being too bad if some old people died. Cummings says that quote came from a Sunday Times story (paywall) that was wrong. He never said that. And the story mentioned a meeting that never took place. He says it led to people coming to his home threatening to kill him. The journalist involved later said it was the worst professional mistake of his career, he says. Cummings says “there was no proper border policy because the prime minister never wanted a proper border policy”. After April, though, it’s a completely different story, once we’ve switched to plan b. Fundamentally, there was no proper border policy because the prime minister never wanted a proper border policy. Repeatedly in meeting after meeting I and others said all we have to do is download the Singapore or Taiwan documents in English and impose them here. We’re imposing all of these restrictions on people domestically but people can see that everyone is coming in from infected areas, it’s madness, it’s undermining the whole message that we should take it seriously. At that point he was back to, ‘lockdown was all a terrible mistake, I should’ve been the mayor of Jaws, we should never have done lockdown 1, the travel industry will all be destroyed if we bring in a serious border policy’. To which, of course, some of us said there’s not going to be a tourism industry in the autumn if we have a second wave, the whole logic was completely wrong. He says Johnson was also being influenced by the Daily Telegraph’s “stupid campaign” on this topic, and Tory MPs were “going crackers” about this too. He says in the early stages of the pandemic Johnson was not prioritising the economy over health. But after April it was a different story. That was when he was opposing border controls, Cummings says. Q: The English death figures were very high partly because untested people were sent back into care homes. How was that decision taken? Cummings says he found this shocking. When they found out in April this was happening, the PM said a less polite version of “What on earth is happening?” Matt Hancock had said in the cabinet room in March that people would be tested before they went back to care homes. The government claimed that it had put a shield around care homes. That was “complete nonsense”. Quite the opposite happened, he says. UPDATE: Cummings said: We were told categorically in March that people would be tested before they went back to homes, we only subsequently found out that that hadn’t happened. Now while the government rhetoric was we have put a shield around care homes and blah blah blah, it was complete nonsense. Quite the opposite of putting a shield around them, we sent people with Covid back to the care homes. Cummings says, if the government had been putting money into lateral flow tests in April, then September would have been very different, because millions of tests would have been available. Q: Why did you not threaten to resign to get your own way? Cummings says he thought about it. He says that, in the week of 16 March, he spoke to people about how if policy did not change, he would resign and hold a press conference saying that thousands of people would die. He says he he had a conversation with Johnson in July 2020 when he said he would leave by the end of December. He says he told Johnson the whole system was “chaos” and that he thought Johnson was more frightened of Cummings having the power to stop the chaos than he was of the chaos itself. He also told the PM he was fed up of working with people like Matt Hancock. Cummings says Johnson laughed and said that Cummings was right. He says Johnson said: You’re right, I am more frightened of you having the power to stop the chaos around than the chaos. Chaos is not bad. Chaos means that everyone has to look to me to see who’s in charge. Labour’s Graham Stringer is asking the questions now. Q: You have described Matt Hancock as a serial liar and disgraceful. Why did the PM not take your advice and sack him? Cummings says Boris Johnson came close to getting rid of him in April. Q: So why did Johnson keep him? Cummings says that would be speculation. There was no good reason for keeping Hancock, he says. Q: Why do you think compliance with self-isolation was not higher? Cummings says one of the problem was the science advice being given to the public. He says the government too much focus on hand washing, and not enough on ventilation. And he says the government did not promise to compensate people for any salary they lost. Back in the hearing Cummings says Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, told Boris Johnson that the cabinet system was not set up to deal with a minister like Matt Hancock who repeatedly lied in meetings. Hunt says that is a serious allegation. He says Hancock himself will be giving evidence to the committee next month. My colleagues Ben Quinn and Peter Walker have been fact checking some of Dominic Cummings’s claims during the hearing so far. Cummings says that, when they were trying to set up the test and trace system, Matt Hancock, the health secretary, interfered. He says that was because he wanted officials to focus on work that would help him meet the target for reaching 100,000 tests per day that he had set. He said Hancock should have been sacked for this alone. It was “criminal, disgraceful behaviour that caused serious harm”, he says. UPDATE: Cummings said: In my opinion, disastrously, the secretary of state had made, while the prime minister was on his near death bed, his pledge to do 100,000 by the end of April. This was an incredibly stupid thing to do because we already had that goal internally. What then happened when I came back around the 13th was I started getting calls and No 10 were getting calls saying Hancock is interfering with the building of the test and trace system because he’s telling everybody what to do to maximise his chances of hitting his stupid target by the end of the month. We had half the government with me in No 10 calling around frantically saying do not do what Hancock says, build the thing properly for the medium term. And we had Hancock calling them all saying down tools on this, do this, hold tests back so I can hit my target. In my opinion he should’ve been fired for that thing alone, and that itself meant the whole of April was hugely disrupted by different parts of Whitehall fundamentally trying to operate in different ways completely because Hancock wanted to be able to go on TV and say ‘look at me and my 100k target’. It was criminal, disgraceful behaviour that caused serious harm. Jeremy Hunt (Con), chair of the health committee, is asking the questions. Q: Why did it take two months to set up a system? Cummings says the core of government “essentially fell apart” early in the crisis. The Dominic Cummings hearing has resumed, and they are now talking about testing. Cummings says in March it was assumed that the UK would not be able to run an Asian-style test and trace system. He says he and others, including Sir Patrick Vallance, pushed against that. He says they realised they would have to build a test, track and trace system from zero. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminter, says Dominic Cummings apologised this morning. Like Starmer, he quotes Cummings’ opening apology. (See 9.36am.) If even a “disgraced figure” like Cummings can apologise, shouldn’t Johnson do the same? Johnson says he is truly sorry for what happened. But the government acted with the intention of saving lives, he says. And it followed the best advice. Blackford asks when the PM will accept responsibilities for the failings of his government. Johnson says he takes responsibility. He has set up an inquiry, he says. Starmer urges the government to bring forward the official inquiry. Johnson says that will not be a good use of officials’ time. You can watch a live stream of PMQs here: Starmer says there is a pattern of behaviour here: lack of planning, poor decision-making and a lack of planning. He says it is alleged Johnson said Covid was only killing 80-year-olds when he resisted the second lockdown. Did the PM use those words, or words to that effect? He says not having a lockdown last autumn was one of the government’s biggest errors. Johnson says this will be a matter for the inquiry. There was a circuit breaker in Wales. Starmer says the Cummings evidence has got to Johnson. He says Cummings accused Matt Hancock of misleading colleagues. Did the cabinet secretary tell him he had lost faith in Hancock’s honesty? No, says Johnson. He says people want the government to focus on reopening the economy. That would be much more profitable line of inquiry for Starmer, he says. Starmer says Cummings says Johnson dismissed this as “another scare story, like the swine flu”. Will the PM apologise for being complacent? Johnson says no one can accuse the government of being complacent about the threat posed. Labour has flip-flopped, he says. Meanwhile the government has got on with the job. Sir Keir Starmer starts by saying Dominic Cummings said the government failed when the public needed it most. Does the PM agree? Johnson says handling the pandemic has been one of the hardest things for government. It has tried to save lives, and followed the best scientific advice. Starmer says a year ago Johnson praised Cummings. Now Cummings says ministers fell “disastrously short”. Does the PM accept that, and that his inaction led to needless deaths? No, says Johnson. He says the inquiry will look at this. He says Starmer is “fixated on the rear-view mirror”. He says everyone over 30 can now come forward for a vaccination. The Cummings hearing is taking a short break, just as PMQs starts. Boris Johnson begins by paying tribute to the former MP Mike Weatherley. In the Commons chamber PMQs is about to start. The Cummings hearing is due for a short break soon, but for a while I may be flitting between one event and the other, posting the most interesting exchanges. Greg Clark is asking the questions again. Q: Were you part of No 10 groupthink? Or did you know it was wrong, but felt too junior to protest? Cummings says, although the original plan looked terrible, one big peak looked better than another peak in the winter. There was a better alternative. But he says people did not start discussing that until 12/13 March. Until then, people thought the alternative approach (lockdown) was possible. And even after that there were people on Sage who thought the lockdown policy was a mistake. The scientists were still arguing about that at the meeting on 18 March. Cummings says he does not think of himself as a whistle-blower. He thinks “it’s a disaster that I acted too late”. But he was frightened of acting, he says. He says he was asking himself if he hit the panic button, and persuaded the PM to change, whether he would be responsible for thousands of deaths. UPDATE: Cummings said: I think it’s a disaster that I acted too late. The fundamental reason was that I was really frightened of acting. If you’ve got an official plan, you’ve got all the Sage advice, you’ve got the Cabinet Office, the cabinet secretary, everyone saying you’ve got to do this and if we don’t do it and if we try and do something different and stop it now it’s going to many times worse in the winter, I was asking myself in that kind of two-week period if I hit the panic button and persuade the prime minister to shift and then it all goes completely wrong, I’m going to have killed god knows how many hundreds of thousands of people. I only had the confidence to do that once I knew that people who are much smarter than me had looked at it and said basically the Sage groupthink is wrong, the DH groupthink is wrong, we’ve got to change course. I apologise for not acting earlier and If I had acted earlier then lots of people might still be alive. Q: Are you here to settle scores? Cummings says he was invited to give evidence. He says the relatives of people who died deserve the truth. Q: Why did you go into No 10? Was it for your agenda or the PM? Cummings says there would have been a crisis if Brexit had not been implemented from the second half of 2019. He says reasonable people can take different views on Brexit, but there was a crisis in 2019. He says “God only knows” what would have happened if Covid had struck then (when parliament was deadlocked). Cummings says, if you had dropped Bill Gates or some of the most competent people in the world, into No 10 in early March they would have found it a complete nightmare. He says there is no doubt that Boris Johnson made “some very bad judgments and got some very serious things wrong”. But he also says Johnson was “extremely badly let down by the whole system”. He says he played a role in that. UPDATE: Cummings said: I have been critical of the prime minister. But ... if you dropped, you know, Bill Gates or someone like that into that job on the 1st of March, the most competent people in the world you could possibly find, any of them would have had a complete nightmare. There is no doubt that the prime minister made some very bad misjudgments and got some very serious things wrong. It’s also the case, there’s no doubt, that he was extremely badly let down by the whole system. And it was a system failure, of which I include myself in that as well, I also failed. Aaron Bell (Con) is asking the questions now. Q: If you knew there was no plan, what were you doing in the first two weeks of March when you could have been drawing one up? Cummings says, from about 25 February, he was having meeting after meeting, trying to find out what was going on. He says the meeting with Helen MacNamara was focused on the NHS. (See 10.32am.) At that point there was not even a plan to bury all the bodies. Asked about the No 10 data system, Cummings says originally he was just using the white board featured in his tweet this morning. Simon Stevens from the NHS came in with figures for people in intensive care. Cummings says he would write them on the white board, and then get his iPhone out to work out the doubling time. Cummings says the civil contingencies secretariat in the Cabinet Office “completely collapsed” under the pressure of what was happening. They did not have the people, they did not have the skills and they did not have the data, he says. He says the whole way the Cabinet Office handles national security issues needs to be changed. He also says the Cobra system does not work. He says people cannot take phones or laptops into the meetings. That is to stop people like the Russians spying. But it did not work for Covid, he says, because people with laptops with the relevant data were not allowed in. The last Cobra meeting he attended was a Potemkin meeting. He says the devolved authorities were there. But people know that, as soon as it was over, Nicola Sturgeon was just going to go out and announce what she wanted to do anyway. Cummings says that one problem with Whitehall is that ministers cannot fire officials. He says it would be better to have some sort of “dictator” in charge. If he had been prime minister, he would have put Mark Warner (his data scientist colleague) in charge of everything, giving him “kingly authority” over Whitehall. The Telegraph’s Gordon Rayner points out that it is going to be a long day. Cummings says he thinks there needs to be a thorough review of risk register planning. As an example, he cites the plans for a terrorist anthrax attack. He says he is concerned the plans are not as robust as they should be. Greg Clark is asking the questions now. Q: Did you engage in unauthorised briefings? Cummings says generally he did not engage with the media. He says that drove the media mad, because in the past people in his position had not done that. But he says he did speak to Laura Kuenssberg, the BBC’s political editor, in 2020. That was because of the special status of the BBC, he says. He says he generally spoke to her every three or four weeks. As an example, he says on 18 March there were rumours of a London-only lockdown, with the military involved. He spoke to Kuenssberg to tell her this was not true. Q: Were your briefings unauthorised? Cummings says they were, in the sense that he did not get permission from the PM first. Clark asks if Cummings will release his messages to journalists. Cummings says he does not see why people should have to reveal all their dealings with journalists. Q: But you have committed to publishing other messages? If these briefings were designed to be helpful, will you share them with the committee? Cummings says most of these dealings were conversations, so there is nothing to share. He says if all dealings with journalists were to be published, that would be a very big change. He asks Clark if he would publish all his WhatsApp messages to journalists. Clark says Cummings is the one talking about transparency. So will you share your text messages. Cummings says he may have very little. That will make it easier, says Clark. Cummings says anything with a direct bearing on decisions made and mistakes made he might share. Clark says the committee can be the judge of that. Cummings says he will not hand over his phone. But he will share some messages with the committee. He also says journalists themselves expect these changes to be private. Clark says the committee will rely on his candour. Cummings says he will need to check the messages for the public inquiry anyway, so he will see what he can do to help. Cummings says that at the last election people had a choice between a government led by Boris Johnson or Jeremy Corbyn. He says any system that presents people with a choice like that has gone “extremely badly wrong”. There are thousands of people who could provide better leadership, he says. He also says it is “crazy” that someone like himself was able to have so much power. And it was “crackers” that Johnson was in there too, he says. It is completely crazy that I should have been in such a senior position in my personal opinion. I’m not smart. I’ve not built great things in the world. It’s just completely crackers that someone like me should have been in there, just the same as it’s crackers that Boris Johnson was in there, and that the choice at the last election was Jeremy Corbyn. He says the political parties need to ask themselves about why they present the public with choices like this. And he says Whitehall needs to explain why people out of their depth reach senior positions. This is from Johnny Mercer, who resigned recently as a defence minister complaining that “almost nobody” told the truth in Boris Johnson’s government. I’ve been beefing up some of the earlier posts with direct quotes from Cummings’ evidence. To get the updates to appear, you may need to refresh the page. Greg Clark asks Cummings for proof that Matt Hancock lied. Cummings says: There are numerous examples. I mean in the summer he said that everybody who needed treatment got the treatment that they required. He knew that that was a lie because he had been briefed by the chief scientific adviser and the chief medical officer himself about the first peak, and we were told explicitly people did not get the treatment they deserved, many people were left to die in horrific circumstances. Clark asks for another example. Cummings says just before he and the PM fell ill, Hancock had told them in the cabinet room that everything was fine with PPE. It wasn’t. Later, when challenged about this, Hancock blamed Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, and the chancellor. He claimed it was not his fault. Cummings says after that meeting the cabinet secretary said he had lost confidence in Hancock’s honesty in these meetings. Clark asks Cummings if he has a note of this. Cummings says he does, and that he will supply it to the committee. Cummings says there was no plan for fulough. A document was published on 3 March for Covid. He says when they received the document, Ben Warner read it and said it was a press release. But that document was supposed to be the plan. He says No 10 were operating on “false assumptions” (because they assumed plans existed which did not). There was no plan for shielding, he says. He says officials did not originally want to set up a phoneline because they thought it would be swamped. He says the plan was put together by Oliver Lewis in two all-nighters. On shielding, on March 19, I pulled all the officials in on shielding to say where is the plan on shielding? Not only was there not a plan, lots of people in the Cabinet Office said we shouldn’t have a plan, we shouldn’t put out a helpline for people to call because it will all just be swamped and we don’t have a system. The shielding plan was literally hacked together in two all-nighters after the 19th, I think, Thursday the 19th. Q: Why did you call the health department a smoking ruin? And did you hear the PM talk about bodies piling up? Cummings says the department’s procurement system was “hopeless”. He says it was turning down ventilators because they were too expensive. He recalls a meeting where he was told it would take months for PPE to arrive. When they were asked why, they said because it was shipped (from China, presumably). When asked why they were shipping it, not flying it in, he says they said that was how they always did it. Rosie Cooper (Lab) is asking the questions now. Q: Why did you not publish the Sage papers? Cummings says Sir Patrick Vallance was in favour of publication, “as you would expect from a good scientist”. Prof Chris Whitty thought the same, and so did Sage. But at that point they were in a crisis, he says. They did not discuss publishing the Sage documents until the week of 9 March, when they were already “dangling over a cliff”. Cooper says Cummings might want to discuss the claim that the PM was willing to see bodies pile up. But she goes on to ask how Cummings rates the performance of the Department for Health. Cummings says there were many brilliant people at middle and junior levels, but they were let down by the leadership. He says Matt Hancock should have been fired for at least 20 things, “including lying to everybody in multiple occasions in meeting after meeting in the cabinet room and publicly”. He says the cabinet secretary also told the PM Hancock should be fired, as did other senior people. UPDATE: Cummings said: Like in much of the government system, there were many brilliant people at relatively junior and middle levels who were terribly let down by senior leadership. I think the secretary of state for health should’ve been fired for at least 15, 20 things, including lying to everybody on multiple occasions in meeting after meeting in the cabinet room and publicly. There’s no doubt at all that many senior people performed far, far disastrously below the standards which the country has a right to expect. I think the secretary of state for health is certainly one of those people. I said repeatedly to the prime minister that he should be fired, so did the cabinet secretary, so did many other senior people. Cummings says in February and early March Boris Johnson, and others, thought the most serious threat was to the economy, not to public health. And he says people also thought they had more time than they did, because Covid was not expected to peak until June. UPDATE: Cummings said: The prime minister’s view, throughout January, February, March, was - as he said in many meetings - the real danger here is not the disease, the real danger here is the measures that we take to deal with a disease and the economic destruction that that will cause. He had that view all the way through. In fact, one of the reasons why it was so rocky getting from the 14th, when we suggested plan B to him, to actual lockdown was because he kept basically bouncing back to ‘we don’t really know how dangerous it is, we’re going to completely destroy the economy by having lockdown, maybe we shouldn’t do it’ ... Now, there have been lots of reports and accusations that the chancellor was the person who was kind of trying to delay in March. That is completely, completely wrong. The chancellor was totally supportive of me and of other people as we tried to make this transition from plan A to plan B. Cummings says what happened was “a classic historic example of groupthink”. The more people criticised the plan, the more people on the inside took the view that others just did not understand. He says part of his job was to challenge things. He did do that, but he obviously did not do that early enough. If the process had been opened up early to scrutiny by smart people, “we would have figured out at least six weeks earlier that there was an alternative plan”. People would have realised the original plan was “complete garbage”, he says. Cummings says there was a meeting where Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, told Boris Johnson that he should go on TV and explain that the herd immunity plan was like chicken pox parties. Cummings says he told Sedwill not to use that analogy. Sedwill queried why. Cummings says he said coronavirus was not like chicken pox, it was spreading exponentially, and thousands of people were dying. UPDATE: Cummings said: We are sitting in the prime minister’s office, the Cabinet were talking about the herd immunity plan. The cabinet secretary said ‘Prime Minister you should go on TV tomorrow and explain to people the herd immunity plan and that it’s like the old chicken pox parties, we need people to get this disease because that’s how we get herd immunity by September’. I said ‘Mark [Sedwill], you have got to stop using this chicken pox analogy, it’s not right’ and he said ‘why’ and Ben Warner said ‘because chicken pox is not spreading exponentially and killing hundreds of thousands of people’. To stress, this wasn’t some thing that cabinet secretary had come up with, he was saying what the official advice to him from the Department of Health was. Hunt puts it to Cummings that it was a “massive failure” on his part taking so long to advise the PM that they needed to change course. Cummings says that that was a “huge failing”. I bitterly regret that I didn’t hit the emergency panic button earlier than I did. In retrospect, there’s no doubt that that I was wrong not to. He says it is clear they should have locked down “in the first week of March at the latest”. UPDATE: Cummings said: In retrospect it is clear that the official plan was wrong, it is clear that the whole advice was wrong, and I think it is clear that we obviously should have locked down essentially the first week of March at the latest. We certainly should have been doing all of these things weeks before we did, I think it’s unarguable that that is the case. Q: On 16 March the PM said people should stay at home. But pubs were not closed. Did you want to go further? Cummings says he wants to explain what happened from Thursday 12 March. At 7.48am he sent a message to the PM. He quotes it. He told the PM the Cabinet Office was “terrifyingly shit”. He says the PM should tell people that day with symptoms to stay at home. But he says the PM was then told that President Trump wanted the UK to join a bombing campaign later. So that took up a lot of attention, and the Covid Cobra meeting was delayed. He says that day the Times ran a story about the PM and the girlfriend and his dog. The PM’s girlfriend wanted the press office to focus on that. She was “going crackers about something completely trivial”. He says, when the Covid meeting did go ahead, they decided to go ahead with household quarantine quite quickly. The attorney general ruled out joining in the US bombing campaign. That night he sat down with Ben Warner and his brother Mark and they discussed how the plan was flawed. On Friday 13 he says he spoke to Sir Patrick Vallance. They discussed how, with the government’s plan, the NHS would be swamped. That night he sat with Ben Warner in the No 10 study and discussed an alternative plan. This is the one he has tweeted. He says at that point Helen MacNamara, the second most powerful civil servant, came in. She said she had been speaking to a Department of Health official who said that there was no plan and that the government was in trouble. She said they were “absolutely fucked”, he says. She said the country was heading for disaster. She realised that Cummings and Warner had come to the same conclusion. He says on Saturday 14 March he told the PM they would have to lock down. But there was no plan for lockdown, he says. Cummings says it was assumed at this point that the British public would not accept a lockdown, and that they would not accept Asian-style track and trace systems. But both assumptions were false, he says. Those two assumptions were completely central to the official plan and were both obviously, completely wrong. Q: You tweeted your picture of plan B this morning? You spoke to the PM on the Saturday 14 March. Was that when you first told the PM the plan was wrong? No, says Cummings. He says Ben Warner’s brother, who worked in the health department, had alerted him earlier to the problems with the official plan. He says on the night of Wednesday 11 March he texted a group, including the PM, that the risks of delay were too high. He quotes from a text he sent. In the message, he said there would be “massive pushback” if the government delayed starting social distancing. In the message he proposing acting more quickly. He says he wanted the government to announce on 12 March that people should stay at home, and quarantine measures too. Cummings says, around 5 March, he was reluctant to abandon the official plan. He says he did not advise the the sports events planned for then should be cancelled. At the time the advice was that those events might not be that bad for transmission, and that cancelling the events might be counter-productive, because people would go to pubs instead. He says no one in the Department for Health drew the logical conclusion - which is that pubs should have been closed too. Jeremy Hunt (Con), the health committee chair, is taking over now. They turn to herd immunity. Cummings says the term can mean different things. The original thinking was: the disease would spread, vaccines would not be available in 2020 .... that was wrong, says Cummings; vaccines could have been obtained earlier. So the logic originally was: Covid would arrive, and there would be a sharp peak. Measures should be introduced to push the peak down, so the NHS could cope. In response to questions about the Chinese lockdown strategy, the argument was: in China suppressing the virus will generate a second peak in the winter, when the NHS is already under pressure. And they argued the public would not accept a lockdown, he says. He says the choice then became one between: a bad, single peak; or two peaks, with the second one in the winter, which would be worse. He says no one wanted this to happen. But they thought this was inevitable, and they thought the choice was herd immunity by September after a single peak, or herd immunity in January 2021 after a second peak. That is why people started talking about it, he says. That was the assumption until Friday 13 March. Q: So when Matt Hancock said on 15 March that there was a plan, and herd immunity was not part of it, was that wrong? Cummings says that was “completely wrong”. He says no one wanted this to happen. But it was seen as an “unavoidable fact”. He says he is “baffled” as to why No 10 is now denying this. Q: Why did you change your blog to make it look as thought you had anticipated coronavirus? Cummings says a lot of these stories are false. He did not change a single letter of what he wrote. But in May last year he says he thought the issue of a lab leak in China would become a huge issue, because President Trump would use it in the US election. So he went back to an article he quoted in the blog. He had half-remembered, half-forgotten it, he says. So he posted a fuller quote in his blog. That was because he wanted people to know that this was not a new issue. Not a single word of what he wrote changed, he says. All he did was included a longer quote from an article quoted in the original. Q: That was an intense period? Did you have the time to be editing old blog posts? Cummings says he thought this would become a huge issue. He wanted people to know that people were warning about this earlier. He says, given he has written so many tens of thousands of words on his blog, he did not think people would be so interested. He says now there is more interest in Wuhan, in the light of the story about people from their lab getting ill in late 2019. Cummings says he was not an expert in the science involved. “I’m not a smart person,” he claims. That is why he got involved. In the early stages a lot of it was doing “above my head”, he says. That is why he sent Ben Warner, a scientist, to the meetings. Cummings says if Johnson had attended a Cobra meeting, and said it was just like swine flu and that he wanted Chris Whitty to inject him with coronavirus live on TV, that would not have helped. Greg Clark, who is asking the questions, does not pursue the allegation, but persists with questions about why Cummings was not able to get people to respond. UPDATE: Cummings said: Certainly, but the view of various officials inside Number 10 was if we have the prime minister chairing Cobra meetings and he just tells everyone ‘it’s swine flu, don’t worry about it, I’m going to get Chris Whitty to inject me live on TV with coronavirus so everyone realises it’s nothing to be frightened of’, that would not help actually serious panic. Q: Did you go to the early Cobra meetings? Cummings says he does not think so. Q: Were you stopped from going? Cummings says he sent Ben Warner, a data scientist, and the PM’s health adviser to those meetings. Q: Were you at any Cobra meetings in February? Cummings says he doesn’t remember. Q: Did you advise the PM to go? No, says Cummings. Q: Why not? Cummings says it was a better use of his time not to go. Q: So Cobra was a waste of time? No, says Cummings. He says Warner was a scientist, so he was a better person to go. he says he personally was briefed one to one by Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser, and Prof Chris Whitty, its chief medical adviser. Another problem was that Cobra meetings “leaked all the time”, he says. He says he preferred to have sensitive discussions elsewhere. Q: So the most sensitive meeting in Cobra leaks? Yes, says Cummings. He says that happened with Brexit meetings. Q: Did you need to book meetings with the PM? Cummings says he just went into the PM’s office. Sometimes he wrote notes, but mostly he just spoke to him. He says he wrote a note to the PM in February, but not January. Q: Do you have a copy? Cummings says if he does, he will give it to the committee. Q: Did you use text and WhatsApp? Cummings says yes. He has copies of some of these messages, and he says he will share them with the committee. Cummings says he had a general chat with Boris Johnson about this in January. But the government did not act as if this was the most important thing, in January or in February. In January “not very much” of his time was devoted to this. In February more time was devoted to it - less than half of the time in the first half of February, but more than half after that, and 90% by the last 10 days. But, he says, the government was “not operating on a war footing” on this in February. Lots of people were “literally skiing”. Q: Were you operating on a war footing? Cummings says the PM “went on holiday for two weeks”. (Boris Johnson was at Chevening at the time. No 10 has always denied he was on holiday. They claim he was working.) Cummings issues another apology, saying he should have “hit the panic button” more than he did. Cummings says on 25 January he sent a text to Matt Hancock, the health secretary, about coronavirus. He asked what what been done to prepare for something like an Ebola outbreak. He says Hancock told him they had full plans, and that they were stress testing. Cummings says he replied: “Great”. He told Hancock he was reading about what the CDC was doing in America. He says he would like to apologise for the fact that he did not follow up on this and push it “in the way that I should have done”. At No 10 they were told a pandemic like this was top of the risk register. He says it is “tragic” that someone like him, used to running “red teams”, did not take the same approach to this. He says if he had taken a Saturday to look at the plans properly then, he would have realised that the plans were “completely hollow”. UPDATE: Cummings said: I would like to stress and apologise for the fact that it is true that I did this but I did not follow up on this and push it the way I should’ve done. We were told in No 10 at the time that this is literally top of the risk register, this has been planned and there’s been exercises on this over and over again, everyone knows what to do. And it’s sort of tragic in a way, that someone who wrote so often about running red teams and not trusting things and not digging into things, whilst I was running red teams about lots of other things in government at this time, I didn’t do it on this. If I had said at the end of January, we’re going to take a Saturday and I want all of these documents put on the table and I want it all gone through and I want outside experts to look at it all, then we’d have figured out much, much earlier that all the claims about brilliant preparations and how everything was in order were basically completely hollow, but we didn’t figure this out until the back end of February. Q: In your No 10 press conference last year you said you had warned of coronavirus for some time. You said you had mentioned this previously on your blog. So, when Wuhan declared an emergency, did you think you had thought about this in advance. Dominic Cummings says senior ministers and senior advisers like him “fell disastrously short of the standards the public had a right to expect in a crisis like this”. He starts with an apology for the mistakes made, and for his own mistakes. He says: “When the public needed us most, the government failed.” UPDATE: Cummings said: The truth is that senior ministers, senior officials, senior advisers like me fell disastrously short of the standards that the public has a right to expect of its government in a crisis like this. When the public needed us most the government failed. I would like to say to all the families of those who died unnecessarily how sorry I am for the mistakes that were made and for my own mistakes at that. Greg Clark (Con), chair of the science committee, opens the hearing. He says Matt Hancock, the health secretary, will give evidence to the joint inquiry on 10 June. After that the two committees doing the inquiry will publish their report. One of the problems that Dominic Cummings faces is that, while it is easy to believe that the government’s handling of coronavirus last year was seriously flawed (the evidence for that is clear, and even Boris Johnson himself as said many mistakes were made), given that he was supposedly the most powerful aide in Downing Street for much of that time, he cannot escape all responsibility. In his London Playbook briefing this morning Alex Wickham says WhatsApp messages are circulating in Whitehall that “blow apart Cummings’ central claim — made in his epic Twitter thread over the past few days — that he has sought to expose government ‘lies’ over its alleged policy of herd immunity during the virus’ first wave”. Wickham writes: The revealing messages were last night circulating throughout Whitehall and call into question Cummings’ current claims to have sought transparency and honesty while, he alleges, government ministers “lied” about herd immunity. The WhatsApps clearly show that, at the beginning of the pandemic in March last year, Cummings directly told his colleagues to publicly deny herd immunity was the government’s policy, and instead agreed they should argue it was a secondary long-term effect of the “mitigation” policy pursued by the government at the start of the crisis. Cummings’ direct order to ministers to deny that herd immunity was their policy could mean one of two things: That herd immunity either never was the government’s main strategy, meaning his tweets over the past few days are wrong, or that it was but he nonetheless instructed ministers to lie, detonating his supposed claims to be pursuing transparency and seriously undermining his credibility ahead of today’s select committee appearance. If Cummings’ tweets of the past few days are to be believed, these messages show he was guilty of the exact thing he is now accusing ministers of doing. This should come as no great surprise. Downing Street has always denied that “herd immunity” was its strategy - even though Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser, said the opposite in a TV interview - and at the time the No 10 head of communications, Lee Cain, was effectively under Cummings’ line management, so Cummings must at least have acquiesced in the denials. Rather than saving up all his anti-Johnson allegations for the hearing, Dominic Cummings seems to have been briefing them out liberally all week - a bit like the Treasury ahead of a budget. The BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg has a new one this morning. Dominic Cummings has been tweeting all week ahead of his evidence today - you can read his mammoth Twitter feed here - and this morning he has topped it up, with a picture of a white board in Downing Street, where on Friday 13 March No 10 staff started drawing up plans for a lockdown. Until then the plan had been for “mitigation”, a softer approach to protecting the public, which is often characterised as the “herd immunity” strategy. On Monday 16 March Boris Johnson announced what was effectively a soft lockdown - he told people to stay at home - and a week later the full, statutory lockdown was announced. As the Labour peer Steward Wood points out, there is a chilling question on the white board: “Who do we not save?” Good morning. Today we are going to get what is probably the most eagerly-anticipated select committee hearing in the Commons since Rupert Murdoch turned up 10 years ago to answer questions about phone hacking. This morning’s attendee is another sometime hate figure for liberal, progressive Britain, although Dominic Cummings is now primarily seen as a Covid whistleblower and a figure hell-bent on damaging Boris Johnson’s premiership, rather than the Vote Leave mastermind who was largely responsible for putting him in No 10 in the first place. Here is my colleague Aubrey Allegretti’s preview story head of the hearing. Here is a background from Aubrey on what to expect. And here is a more brutal take from my colleague Marina Hyde, who says “the level of self-mythologising indulged in by Cummings and his capos has been off the scale”. Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, was doing the morning media round for No 10 this morning and on Times Radio he rubbished Cummings using the nickname that Boris Johnson uses to describe Sir Keir Starmer, “Captain Hindsight”. Given that Starmer has had a much better record than Johnson at anticipating the need for lockdown measures, that might not be as effective a put-down as Shapps thinks. But Shapps also cast doubt on Cummings’ reliability. He told BBC Breakfast: I will leave it to others to judge how reliable a witness that former adviser happens to be. Asked if Cummings was a “trusted adviser” to the PM when he worked in Downing Street as Johnson’s chief strategist, Shapps replied: He was certainly an adviser of the government. It’s for others to decide the trusted part of it. Here is the timetable for the day. 9.30am: Dominic Cummings starts giving evidence to a joint hearing of the Commons health and science committees. 12pm: Boris Johnson faces Sir Keir Starmer at PMQs. 1.30pm: Downing Street is expected to hold its daily lobby briefing. Today I will be mostly focusing on what Cummings says. For global coronavirus news, do read our global live blog. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can’t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.

The facility is a transit control center that stores trains and has a maintenance yard. A spokesperson for the Valley Transportation Authority did not immediately respond to multiple requests for comment. A shooting at a railyard in San Jose, California, has left multiple people dead and several others injured, a spokesperson for the Santa Clara County sheriff’s office said. The spokesperson would not say the exact number of victims, but he confirmed to reporters that there were “multiple injuries and multiple fatalities” from the shooting. The victims include Valley Transportation Authority employees. The mayor of San Jose, Sam Liccardo, previously said on Twitter that the shooter is now dead and the facility has been evacuated. He said more information would be made available in about 30 minutes. California Governor Gavin Newsom also said in a tweet that he is closely monitoring the situation and remains in contact with local law enforcement officials. Second gentleman Douglas Emhoff will travel tomorrow to Albuquerque, New Mexico, the White House has just announced. According to Politico, the vice-president’s husband is traveling to the state to campaign for Melanie Stansbury, the Democratic congressional candidate who is running to fill Interior Secretary Deb Haaland’s seat in the House. Politico reports: The second gentleman will be heading to New Mexico to campaign with Democratic congressional candidate Melanie Stansbury ahead of the special election on Tuesday, according to two sources with knowledge of the planning. An administration official says the event will take place on Thursday. ... This won’t be the first political event for Emhoff who joined DNC Chair Jaime Harrison in March for the latter’s first virtual fundraiser. It is, however, his first campaign event since the November election. Emhoff is no stranger to the trail. He was a mainstay of Vice President Kamala Harris’ primary bid and did solo events during the general election after she joined the Biden ticket. Joe Biden endorsed Stansbury in a statement yesterday, saying she has “the grit and determination to deliver real results for all New Mexicans”. The seat is considered safely Democratic, given that Biden won it by 23 points in November. New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft has denied allegations he and Donald Trump attempted to pay a senator money in order to drop an investigation into a cheating scandal involving the team. According to a report published on Wednesday by ESPN, Trump met with late senator Arlen Specter in 2008 and offered him “money in Palm Beach” if he dropped his investigation into the Spygate scandal, in which the Patriots were disciplined by the NFL for filming a rival team’s coaching signals. Trump had not started his political career at the time and was well-known as the star of reality show The Apprentice. ESPN says Trump was acting on behalf of Kraft, a claim those close to the former president and the team deny. “This [report] is completely false,” Jason Miller, a senior adviser to Trump, told ESPN when asked about the story. “We have no idea what you’re talking about.” A spokesman for the Patriots also denied the allegations to ESPN. “Mr Kraft is not aware of any involvement of Trump on this topic and he did not have any other engagement with Specter or his staff,” the spokesman said via email. Specter was senator for Pennsylvania at the time and ran as a Democrat and Republican during his political career. He was also a personal friend of Trump. Trump himself has been on friendly terms with several prominent members of the Patriots including Kraft, head coach Bill Belichick and former quarterback Tom Brady. Both Brady and Belichick have distanced themselves from Trump recently. In January, following the US Capitol invasion, Belichick turned down Trump’s offer of the presidential medal of freedom. Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer said the flags around the Senate side of the US Capitol will be lowered to half-staff in honor of the late senator John Warner, who died last night at the age of 94. “On behalf of the Senate, I want to express our condolences to his family and his friends, and our gratitude for amazing service to America throughout his life,” the Democratic leader said in a floor speech moments ago. Virginia Governor Ralph Northam described the late senator John Warner as “the best of what public service and elected leadership should be”. “Virginia, and America, have lost a giant,” the Democratic governor said in a statement. “As a sailor, a senator, a statesman, and a gentleman, former U.S. Senator John Warner spent his life in public service.” Northam offered his prayers to Warner’s family members as they mourn his death at the age of 94. “John helped build up his political party and always remained an independent voice. He used that voice in the Senate to forge bipartisan compromise, knowing how and when to reach across the aisle. And he always put Virginia first,” Northam said. “Our prayers for comfort go out to his wife Jeanne, his three children, grandchildren, scores of friends, and all those who loved him.” John Warner, the longtime former Republican senator of Virginia who clashed with George W Bush over the Iraq War, has died of heart failure at 94. Reuters reports: Warner died late on Tuesday, with his wife and daughter at his side, his chief of staff, Susan Magill, said in an email to family and friends, according to a Politico report on Wednesday. The Washington Post said he died in Alexandria, Virginia. Warner was an influential voice in Congress on military policy and served in the US Senate for five terms from 1979 to 2009. He was also the sixth husband of the actor Elizabeth Taylor. A former chairman of the Senate armed services committee, Warner openly criticized President George W Bush’s handling of the Iraq war and called on him in 2007 to begin withdrawing US troops from Iraq. The decision put Warner in the center of a growing debate in Congress over the conflict. Warner spent months trying to develop an approach to US policy in Iraq that was supported by Republicans and Democrats. Lawmakers of both parties responded to the news of Warner’s death by offering admiring condolence messages to the his family. Current Virginia Senator Mark Warner, who was not related to the late senator, said of him, “John Warner was a consummate statesman and a public servant who always put Virginia before politics; who put the nation’s security before partisanship; who put the country’s needs above his own.” When deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre holds her first formal White House briefing this afternoon, she will be only the second Black woman to ever do so, according to a CBS News reporter. Alexandra Villarreal reports on how white male minority rule has overtaken US politics: From county officials and sheriffs to governors and senators, white male minority rule pervades politics in the United States, according to a new report published on Wednesday. White men represent 30% of the population but 62% of officeholders, dominating both chambers of Congress, 42 state legislatures and statewide roles across the nation, the analysis shows. By contrast, women and people of color constitute 51% and 40% of the US population respectively, but just 31% and 13% of officeholders, according to the research by the Reflective Democracy Campaign, shared exclusively with the Guardian. “I think if we saw these numbers in another country, we would say there is something very wrong with that political system,” said Brenda Choresi Carter, the campaign’s director. “We would say, ‘how could that possibly be a democratic system with that kind of demographic mismatch?’” Read Alexandra’s full report here: Today will also mark an important first at the White House. Principal deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre will be doing her first full briefing from the briefing room podium this afternoon. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Twitter, “Today is a big day in the press office and @WhiteHouse. My partner in truth--@KJP46 is doing her first full briefing from the podium today making history in her own right. But doing her real justice means also recognizing her talent, her brilliance and her wonderful spirit.” Jean-Pierre has done briefings with reporters aboard Air Force One before, usually as the president flies across the country promoting his American Rescue Plan or American Jobs Plan. But this will be her first official appearance at the briefing room podium. Reporters will be watching Jean-Pierre closely because she has been suggested as a potential successor to Psaki, who has indicated she only wants to serve as press secretary for one year. If Jean-Pierre did get the job, she would be the first Black woman to hold the post. Joe Biden has reportedly signaled to Republican senators working on infrastructure negotiations that he would be willing to accept a $1 trillion counteroffer. CNN reports: Two key GOP negotiators -- Sens. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and Roger Wicker of Mississippi -- both indicated on Tuesday that Biden has signaled openness to that price tag, a reason why they plan to make a counteroffer around that amount on Thursday, even as there are still sharp disagreements on how to pay for the massive proposal. ‘The President indicated he would accept that number,’ Wicker told CNN, referring to $1 trillion. The upcoming Senate GOP offer is a sign that negotiations with the White House aren’t over yet even as talks are teetering on the edge ahead of a Memorial Day deadline. GOP negotiators met Tuesday behind closed doors, telling reporters that they planned to offer a new infrastructure proposal Thursday that will approach $1 trillion in part because they believe the two sides could find agreement there. ‘He used that figure with us, yes,’ Capito said when asked if Biden showed a willingness to accept a $1 trillion proposal, adding that the President also suggested a package of investments over an eight-year time frame. ‘We’re responding to what he proposed.’ The White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, would not confirm yesterday whether Biden had signaled he would be comfortable with $1 trillion as the topline number for the infrastructure package. “I’m not going to read any more specifics of a private conversation,” Psaki told reporters. “But I will just reiterate that the proposal put forward last Friday, that we put out transparently to all of you, that brought the price tag down by $550 billion was directed, signed off on by the president of the United States.” Greetings from Washington, live blog readers. Senate Republicans are expected to propose a counteroffer tomorrow in the ongoing negotiations over an infrastructure package, and their plan is expected to cost around $1 trillion. “We’re going to hit a figure very close to what the president said he would accept, and it will end up being the most substantial infrastructure bill ever enacted by the federal government,” Republican Senator Roger Wicker told reporters yesterday. “And if the president gets to make the decision, he will accept it.” The new offer comes almost a week after Joe Biden proposed a smaller infrastructure bill than he had originally proposed, lowering the overall cost of his plan from $2.25 trillion to $1.7 trillion. Republicans complained that price tag was still too high for them, but Democrats have insisted the plan must include items like massive investments in green energy, which the Republican plans have largely omitted. If Biden does not like Republicans’ latest offer, Democrats could still try to pass an infrastructure bill using reconciliation, thus avoiding a Senate filibuster. But Democrats’ key 50th Senate vote, Joe Manchin, may not be on board for that, so all eyes will be on the Republicans’ as they propose their counteroffer.

But instead the speech brought accusations of “blatant Islamophobia” and staff being instructed to help students into and out of school safely following the furious response.</p> <p>Similar disputes have occurred in schools across the UK since the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/21/gaza-israel-ceasefire-biden-raab-guterres\">latest deadly violence in Israel and Gaza</a>, with questions raised over why children expressing support for Palestine are being accused of antisemitism and in some cases subjected to disciplinary action.</p> <p>During a protest at Clapton girls’ academy in east London, students sat down and chanted “free Palestine”, refusing to return to lessons. One student, Mina, said the children had decided to protest after teachers removed posters about the Palestinian struggle from the walls of the schools. </p> <p>A spokesperson for the academy said: “There was a respectful protest at the school where students raised issues related to Palestine. A small number of posters were taken down because students did not request permission to put them up beforehand.”</p> <p>In Manchester, senior leaders at Loreto college decided to close the institution after hearing about a planned protest. About 200 students went on to assemble near the gates waving flags, with members of the public joining the march.</p> <p>At Allerton Grange it is understood tensions had been bubbling for a number of days before Roper’s controversial assembly, with some pupils claiming they had lanyards bearing the Palestinian flag confiscated.</p> <p>In the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_Reece_____/status/1395885305392254976\">two-minute video</a> the headteacher describes speaking to 20 students urging them not to use symbols and flags as some people may see the flag and “feel threatened and unsafe”. He went on to add: “That flag is seen as a call to arms and seen as a message of support for antisemitism.”</p> <p>A statement was later issued in which Roper said he was “deeply sorry that a particular example I used in that assembly, referring to the Palestinian flag, has caused such upset” and promised to engage with local councillors and community representatives about the issues raised.</p> <p>The Scottish Green MSP Ross Greer said: “Imagine being a Palestinian kid at this guy’s school, being told your national flag is inherently hateful. Absolutely outrageous.”</p> <p>The author and Cambridge University academic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/priyamvadagopal\">Priyamvada Gopal</a> also reacted with dismay to the video.She said: “Young people can be taught about the evils of antisemitism, and they can learn about the Palestinian flag and its importance to a people’s struggle for self-determination.

Mike Roper, the headteacher of Allerton Grange high school in Leeds, was forced to apologise after he claimed in an assembly that some people saw the flag as a “symbol of antisemitism”. Video of the speech was posted online, going viral and prompting a backlash and protests, with extra police having to be posted outside the school. The assembly was intended, the school said, to address tensions within its multiracial student community caused by the situation in Israel. But instead the speech brought accusations of “blatant Islamophobia” and staff being instructed to help students into and out of school safely following the furious response. Similar disputes have occurred in schools across the UK since the latest deadly violence in Israel and Gaza, with questions raised over why children expressing support for Palestine are being accused of antisemitism and in some cases subjected to disciplinary action. During a protest at Clapton girls’ academy in east London, students sat down and chanted “free Palestine”, refusing to return to lessons. One student, Mina, said the children had decided to protest after teachers removed posters about the Palestinian struggle from the walls of the schools. A spokesperson for the academy said: “There was a respectful protest at the school where students raised issues related to Palestine. A small number of posters were taken down because students did not request permission to put them up beforehand.” In Manchester, senior leaders at Loreto college decided to close the institution after hearing about a planned protest. About 200 students went on to assemble near the gates waving flags, with members of the public joining the march. At Allerton Grange it is understood tensions had been bubbling for a number of days before Roper’s controversial assembly, with some pupils claiming they had lanyards bearing the Palestinian flag confiscated. In the two-minute video the headteacher describes speaking to 20 students urging them not to use symbols and flags as some people may see the flag and “feel threatened and unsafe”. He went on to add: “That flag is seen as a call to arms and seen as a message of support for antisemitism.” A statement was later issued in which Roper said he was “deeply sorry that a particular example I used in that assembly, referring to the Palestinian flag, has caused such upset” and promised to engage with local councillors and community representatives about the issues raised. The Scottish Green MSP Ross Greer said: “Imagine being a Palestinian kid at this guy’s school, being told your national flag is inherently hateful. Absolutely outrageous.” The author and Cambridge University academic Priyamvada Gopal also reacted with dismay to the video.She said: “Young people can be taught about the evils of antisemitism, and they can learn about the Palestinian flag and its importance to a people’s struggle for self-determination. We are all capable of holding more than one thought in our head at the same time, and students should not be patronised by pretending otherwise.” Ilyas Nagdee, a former NUS black students’ officer who works on race equality in education, said he had received reports of close to 100 cases of young people facing consequences for speaking up about Palestine. These included being accused of antisemitism, punished, excluded from school, threatened with a report to Prevent anti-radicalisation programme and even being visited by police.

This was never our intention – nor do we ever want to silence a particular community or point of view.”","charCount":"5070","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/kari-paul\">Kari Paul</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2021/may/26/boris-johnson-under-pressure-from-biden-and-activists-in-run-up-to-g7","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-26T15:58:21Z","webTitle":"Boris Johnson under pressure from Biden and activists in run-up to G7","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/26/boris-johnson-under-pressure-from-biden-and-activists-in-run-up-to-g7","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/may/26/boris-johnson-under-pressure-from-biden-and-activists-in-run-up-to-g7","fields":{"headline":"Boris Johnson under pressure from Biden and activists in run-up to G7","standfirst":"<p>US pushing UK hard over minimum corporate tax and swift action on global Covid vaccinations</p>","trailText":"US pushing UK hard over minimum corporate tax and swift action on global Covid vaccinations","byline":"Larry Elliott and Richard Partington","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"804056a2f392a9977ff92074eaf81cc0e439c7b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/804056a2f392a9977ff92074eaf81cc0e439c7b5/0_69_2229_1338/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson waves as he leaves Downing Street\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The UK prime minister had been hoping the summit would be a show of unity and pave the way for a successful Cop26 conference in November.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tayfun Salcı/Zuma Wire/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Boris Johnson is facing mounting pressure from Joe Biden and grass roots activists to be bolder at next month’s G7 summit amid signs that rows over vaccines and tax will dominate what the prime minister hoped would be a low-key event.</p> <p>The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, kicks off two weeks of intense international diplomacy ahead of the June gathering of the leaders of major western economies in Cornwall when he hosts a virtual meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors on Friday.</p> <p>After fractious summits when Donald Trump was US president, the prime minister had been hoping that the Carbis Bay summit would put on a show of unity and pave the way for a successful climate change deal at November’s Cop26 conference in Glasgow.</p> <p>Yet the UK government is now being pushed hard by the Biden administration in three areas: on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/may/23/sunak-under-pressure-to-back-bidens-global-corporation-tax-plan\">minimum corporate tax rate,</a> on the waiving of patents to speed up production of Covid-19 treatments in poor countries, and a G7 burden-sharing deal to fund a global vaccination push.</p> <p>Meanwhile, African countries angered at what they see as “vaccine apartheid” have issued warnings that they will adopt a tough line at the Cop26 talks unless the G7 delivers a generous funding package in Cornwall.</p> <p>“Vaccine nationalism is hindering progress on tackling the virus in Africa,” said Dr Ahmed Ogwell Ouma, deputy director, of Africa’s Centre for Disease Control, as he called on G7 countries to ensure vaccines were equitably shared. “Not doing so is a moral, political failure.

The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, kicks off two weeks of intense international diplomacy ahead of the June gathering of the leaders of major western economies in Cornwall when he hosts a virtual meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors on Friday. After fractious summits when Donald Trump was US president, the prime minister had been hoping that the Carbis Bay summit would put on a show of unity and pave the way for a successful climate change deal at November’s Cop26 conference in Glasgow. Yet the UK government is now being pushed hard by the Biden administration in three areas: on a minimum corporate tax rate, on the waiving of patents to speed up production of Covid-19 treatments in poor countries, and a G7 burden-sharing deal to fund a global vaccination push. Meanwhile, African countries angered at what they see as “vaccine apartheid” have issued warnings that they will adopt a tough line at the Cop26 talks unless the G7 delivers a generous funding package in Cornwall. “Vaccine nationalism is hindering progress on tackling the virus in Africa,” said Dr Ahmed Ogwell Ouma, deputy director, of Africa’s Centre for Disease Control, as he called on G7 countries to ensure vaccines were equitably shared. “Not doing so is a moral, political failure. I would like to call upon PM Johnson that generosity is a strategic issue. As hosts of the summit in June PM Johnson needs to take a lead.” Tasneem Essop, executive director of Climate Action Network – a coalition of 1,300 environmental NGOs, said: “If developing countries do not get urgent help on vaccines and a radical hike in climate finance to cover new investments, adaptation and damage then Boris can forget any deal in Glasgow.” Pressure on the government is also coming from a grassroots campaign – Crack the Crises – organised by 75 diverse NGOs including Oxfam, Save the Children, the Women’s Institute and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. Kirsty McNeill, of Crack the Crises said: “There’s simply no way the government can claim the Global Britain mantle without a significant ramping up of their ambition in the next two weeks. Reversing the aid cuts, agreeing to share the financial burden for vaccinating the world and working with others to secure a decent tax deal would start to look like we want to play our part for people and planet.” Whitehall sources played down the chances of a breakthrough on any of the unresolved issues at tomorrow’s meeting but Sunak is confident a face-to-face meeting of finance ministers next week will deliver a G7 deal that would ensure companies report the climate change risks to their business. This modest step is unlikely to be enough for the US Treasury secretary Janet Yellen, who is being advised by David Lipton, the former number two at the International Monetary Fund. The US is concerned that a lack of action on Covid-19 at the G7 will mean handing victory to Russia and China – both of which have supplied vaccines to poor countries – in the international vaccine diplomacy struggle. Yellen also wants a global tax deal to provide cover for the increase in US corporation tax. The plan put forward by Washington includes two main pillars: one enabling countries to tax some of the profits made by big companies based on the revenue they generate in that nation, rather than where the firm is located for tax purposes, and a second setting a minimum global corporation tax rate. The proposals are being negotiated between 135 nations at the OECD in Paris, with an aim of reaching an agreement by October after decades of stalling progress. The Biden proposals have received backing from several nations, including the other countries in the G7 – Germany, France, Italy, Canada and Japan – but not from Britain. Sunak is believed to be comfortable with agreeing a global minimum corporation tax rate, although he is prioritising an agreement on pillar one with the ambition to increase the levels of tax paid by large tech firms such as Amazon, Facebook and Google. The US had proposed a rate of 21% for a global corporate minimum, but dropped the recommendation earlier this month to 15% in an apparent bid to secure international backing. UK sources said a tax breakthrough was possible at the in-person meeting of finance ministers next week but said Sunak’s concern was that accepting the US plan would leave Britain worse off. The former prime minister Gordon Brown, who has been pushing for G7 action on tax and vaccines, said the UK would eventually bow to pressure from Washington. “ I don’t know why Britain is rejecting the US proposal for a minimum global tax rate,” Brown said. “I can only think it has something to do with protecting overseas tax havens.”","charCount":"4957","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/larryelliott\">Larry Elliott</a> and <a href=\"profile/richard-partington\">Richard Partington</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}

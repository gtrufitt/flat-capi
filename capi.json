Human beings are creatures of the imagination.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Johnson has been influenced by his grandmother’s advice that what you do is more important than how you do it, McTague writes. </strong>He says:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At Downing Street, I heard Johnson repeat a saying his maternal grandmother was fond of quoting. “Darling,” he said, mimicking her, “remember, it’s not <em>how</em> you’re doing; it’s <em>what</em> you’re doing.” Johnson said this was “the key advice.” I asked Johnson’s sister, Rachel, about it. She told me their mother was also fond of the saying. “It’s about being in the moment,” she said, rather than worrying about how things will turn out.</p> </blockquote> <p>One suspects this explains a lot ...</p> <ul> <li><strong>Johnson has described himself as a “very, very bad Christian”.</strong> McTague says:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A friend of his once told me he suspected that Johnson subscribed to a pre-Christian morality system, with a multitude of gods and no clear set of rules. I put this to the prime minister, but he dismissed the notion. “Christianity is a superb ethical system and I would count myself as a kind of very, very bad Christian,” he told me. “No disrespect to any other religions, but Christianity makes a lot of sense to me.”</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Johnson does not see himself as a nationalist, McTague says.</strong> He writes:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[Johnson] told me that he doesn’t think of himself as a nationalist, but he argued that individuals need to feel that they belong, and they shouldn’t be patronised for worrying that their traditions and connections are being eroded. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"120431185f436d77a9868a39b11ea2cb34702a05\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/120431185f436d77a9868a39b11ea2cb34702a05/0_0_6152_4101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson after receiving his second dose of vaccine last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson after receiving his second dose of vaccine last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: WPA/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60be22708f08b9889b36b9e0\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-07T13:55:24.116Z\">2.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Majority of voters want Covid inquiry to start this year, poll suggests</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More than half of voters want the public inquiry into the Covid pandemic to start either this summer (39%) or this autumn (17%), <a href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-mori/en-uk/conservatives-buoyed-positive-public-ratings-handling-pandemic\">new polling from Ipsos MORI </a>suggests.

Here are some of the other points he made.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Mitchell claimed that the pro-government briefing about his amendment being disallowed was premature, and could be counter-productive.</strong> He told the programme:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Certainly, some of the briefing that he’s already made up his mind seeks to trespass on Mr Speaker’s authority. He won’t have liked that very much. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said that his amendment was “clearly in order”, because it was allowed on the order paper, and that whether or not it was in scope (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2021/jun/07/uk-politics-live-news-covid-coronavirus-boris-johnson-vote-cuts-aid-budget-delta-variant-latest-updates?page=with:block-60bdef008f082e80569f8bba#block-60bdef008f082e80569f8bba\">11.33am) </a>was only one factor to be taken into account. </strong>He said other issues could include “parliament’s relationship with the executive” - a reference to the fact ministers proposed cutting aid spending without giving MPs a vote on the issue.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He said that, if Hoyle did allow the amendment to be put to a vote, he would not have to publish a statement explaining why he was ignoring existing parliamentary conventions. </strong>When Hoyle became Speaker, he promised to do this <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/article/lindsay-hoyle-pledges-greater-transparency-in-veiled-attack-on-john-bercow\">if he took a decision overturning standing orders or breaking “long-established” conventions.</a> Mitchell said that he had been told this decision would not cross that threshold. That suggests the advice from Hoyle’s officials is not absolute, and that it might be arguable that the amendment should be allowed.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Mitchell said Hoyle should take into account that at the 2019 election government and opposition MPs were all elected promising to keep aid spending at 0.7% of national income.</strong></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\"

Asked if it would be on top of the existing aid budget, the spokesman said: “The £10bn has been largely allocated in the spending plans already set out with regards to ODA funding, but I’m not going

The decision is related to the Commons concept of the “scope” of a bill.</p> <p>This is <a href=\"https://erskinemay.parliament.uk/section/5313/the%20scope%20of%20a%20bill/\">what Erskine May, the Commons procedural rule book, says about scope.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The scope of a bill represents the reasonable limits of its collective purposes, as defined by its existing clauses and schedules. In particular cases, difficult questions of judgment may arise. The scope of a bill, particularly of a bill with several purposes, may be wider than its long title, although the long title may help to determine the scope. Conversely, a bill with a single purpose may have a narrow scope even though the long title is apparently wide (for example, ‘a Bill to amend a certain Act’).</p> </blockquote> <p>Amendments are not allowed if they are out of scope.</p> <p>But deciding whether or not an amendment is within scope is not straightforward. An amendment to a clause may be inadmissible because it is not relevant to that clause, but it might be acceptable if tabled in a different form (as a new clause) because it is within the scope of the bill as a whole. And, as a bill goes through parliament, its scope can widen; one amendment may push the door open for others.</p> <p>And at least two stages are involved in deciding if an amendment is in scope. If it clearly isn’t, the clerks will not allow it to be tabled (printed<a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-02/0001/amend/ARIA_day_rep_0607.pdf\"> on the order paper)</a>. But getting an amendment onto the order paper does not mean it will be put to the vote because the Speaker takes the final decision ahead of the debate, on the advice of clerks. This morning they have reportedly told him the aid amendment is inadmissible. Their advice, like government legal advice, is strictly private, but one test is whether passing an amendment would change the nature of the whole bill. Passing this amendment would effectively turn the advanced research and innovation agency bill into the aid spending bill, and so getting it accepted was probably always a long shot (although the MPs behind it had no incentive to admit it).</p> <p>The Speaker can decide to over-rule the advice he gets. John Bercow did this during the Brexit process, generating huge controversy. But when Sir Lindsay Hoyle was elected to replace him, he promised to show more respect for existing convention, and said that if he ever did divert from current procedure (as Bercow did), <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/article/lindsay-hoyle-pledges-greater-transparency-in-veiled-attack-on-john-bercow\">he would publish a statement explaining why. </a>It is not something he has ever had to do.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"adcb6f1299a2eebd9d46343c181992400319d64b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/adcb6f1299a2eebd9d46343c181992400319d64b/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sir Lindsay Hoyle.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sir Lindsay Hoyle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UK Parliament/Jessica Taylor/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-06-07T10:34:02.540Z\">at 11.34am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-60bdeb228f08b9889b36b665\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-07T09:49:53.731Z\">10.49am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is my colleague <strong>Jessica Elgot</strong>’s story about the advice that the rebel amendment on aid spending should not be put to a vote.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/jun/07/tory-rebels-thwarted-in-bid-to-force-vote-on-uk-foreign-aid-cut\">Tory rebels face setback in bid to force vote on UK foreign aid cut</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60bde99d8f082e80569f8b61\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-07T09:42:09.334Z\">10.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is more on the decision from the Speaker.</p> <p>This is from the Times’ <strong>Steven Swinford.</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Steven_Swinford/status/1401830960803598337\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">A bid by more than 30 Tory MPs to reverse foreign aid cuts is highly unlikely to go to a vote<br><br>Clerks have advised amendment is &#39;completely out of scope&#39; and would set a dangerous precedent for all future spending<br><br>There is also &#39;strong legal advice against it</p>&mdash; Steven Swinford (@Steven_Swinford) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Steven_Swinford/status/1401830960803598337?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 7, 2021</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>And this is from the Telegraph’s <strong>Lucy Fisher.</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/LOS_Fisher/status/1401832657835724800\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">BREAKING: Planned Tory rebellion in Commons today aimed at reversing foreign aid cuts has been thwarted.<br><br>Clerks have determined the rebels&#39; amendment is &quot;completely out of scope&quot; of ARIA Bill &amp; their unequivocal advice is that it should not be called.</p>&mdash; Lucy Fisher (@LOS_Fisher) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LOS_Fisher/status/1401832657835724800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 7, 2021</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60bde7e88f082e80569f8b46\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-07T09:38:00.516Z\">10.38am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Tory rebellion over aid spending set to be averted as amendment ruled not in scope</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Boris Johnson no longer faces a Commons revolt tonight because the Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, has decided not to call the amendment on the grounds that it is outside the scope of the bill’s purpose, my colleague<strong> Jessica Elgot</strong> reports.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jessicaelgot/status/1401833901111320579\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Parliamentary procedure saves Boris Johnson - the aid rebellion will not happen today - the amendment is not in scope.

Tonight MPs may get the chance to vote on an amendment to the advanced research and innovation agency bill to restore the 0.7% aid spending target next year and, if they do, the Tory rebels supporting it are confident that the government will lose. That is what one of their leaders, <strong>David Davis</strong>, the former Brexit secretary, told the Today programme this morning. Asked if he was confident that that the government would lose if there were a vote, he replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Yes, I’m pretty sure.

In fact there are three outcomes that are all quite possible. They are:</p> <p>1) Ministers could “buy off” the rebels by promising to reverse the aid cut next year. They have already said that the cut (from 0.7% of national income to 0.5%) is only temporary, but there are suspicions that by this Boris Johnson means temporary in the sense that income tax was temporary when William Pitt introduced it to fund the Napoleonic War.</p> <p>2) The Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, may decide not to put the amendment to a vote. Commons officials have allowed the amendment to be tabled, which suggests that it is within the “scope” of the bill (ie, not irrelevant to the topic it covers). But that does not automatically mean it will be selected, even though a large number of MPs want it put to the vote. The Speaker also has to make a judgment about whether it is relevant to the purpose of the bill, and if he concludes that it isn’t - because it would effectively turn a science research bill into an aid spending bill - he can reject it.</p> <p>3) The government could push the amendment to the vote, and lose. Although this would be embarrassing for Johnson, there would be two consolatory bonuses: it would stop this issue overshadowing the G7 summit later this week, and it would reinforce Johnson’s claim to be a leader championing the wishes of the public <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2020/11/25/two-thirds-britons-support-cutting-foreign-aid-bud\">(voters overwhelmingly support the aid spending cut)</a> in the face of obstruction from a supposedly out-of-touch parliament.</p> <p>There are two other outcomes that are less probable.</p> <p>4) The government could push the amendment to a vote without offering any compromise - and squeak a narrow win.</p> <p>5) Ministers could abandon the bill altogether.</p> <p>The final option is highly unlikely although, given that the only person in government who was truly committed to setting up the advanced research and innovation agency was Dominic Cummings, Johnson must find the idea tempting. (One reason why he was willing to cut aid spending in the first place, despite the Tory manifesto saying it should stay at 0.7%, was because higher aid spending was a policy associated with David Cameron, another of his arch rivals.)</p> <p>Here is the agenda for the day.<br></p> <p><em>9.30am:</em> The ONS publishes figures on vaccination rates amongst the over-70s by class.</p> <p><em>10.30am:</em> Dr Bola Owolabi, director of health inequalities for NHS England, speaks at a seminar on about vaccine confidence amongst people from African, Bangladeshi, Caribbean and Pakistani backgrounds.</p> <p><em>12pm:</em> Downing Street is expected to hold its daily lobby briefing.</p> <p><em>2.30pm: </em>Matthew Rycroft, permanent secretary at the Home Office, gives evidence to the public accounts committee about the Windrush compensation scheme.</p> <p><em>2.30pm:</em> Priti Patel, the home secretary, takes questions in the Commons.</p> <p><em>2.30pm:</em> Sir Keir Starmer gives a speech to the GMB conference.</p> <p><em>After 3.30pm:</em> MPs begin debating the remaining stages of the advanced research and invention agency bill.

Tom McTague’s profile of Boris Johnson in The Atlantic is definitely worth reading in full, but for those of you who have not had time to get through all 7,000 words, here are some of the best snippets. Boris Johnson believes “people live by narrative”. He tells McTague: People live by narrative. Human beings are creatures of the imagination. Johnson has been influenced by his grandmother’s advice that what you do is more important than how you do it, McTague writes. He says: At Downing Street, I heard Johnson repeat a saying his maternal grandmother was fond of quoting. “Darling,” he said, mimicking her, “remember, it’s not how you’re doing; it’s what you’re doing.” Johnson said this was “the key advice.” I asked Johnson’s sister, Rachel, about it. She told me their mother was also fond of the saying. “It’s about being in the moment,” she said, rather than worrying about how things will turn out. One suspects this explains a lot ... Johnson has described himself as a “very, very bad Christian”. McTague says: A friend of his once told me he suspected that Johnson subscribed to a pre-Christian morality system, with a multitude of gods and no clear set of rules. I put this to the prime minister, but he dismissed the notion. “Christianity is a superb ethical system and I would count myself as a kind of very, very bad Christian,” he told me. “No disrespect to any other religions, but Christianity makes a lot of sense to me.” Johnson does not see himself as a nationalist, McTague says. He writes: [Johnson] told me that he doesn’t think of himself as a nationalist, but he argued that individuals need to feel that they belong, and they shouldn’t be patronised for worrying that their traditions and connections are being eroded. More than half of voters want the public inquiry into the Covid pandemic to start either this summer (39%) or this autumn (17%), new polling from Ipsos MORI suggests. Only 17% back spring 2022, the start date proposed by Boris Johnson, according to the survey. But this does not seem to affect the voters’ overall perception of the government. On headline voting intention, the Conservatives (44%) have a nine-point lead over Labour (35%) – up from a three-point lead last month. And the proportion of people saying the government has handled the crisis badly is now at its lowest level since last spring. Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, will announce at 3.30pm, in the Commons chamber, whether or not the aid spending amendment will be accepted. This is from the Independent’s Ashley Cowburn reports. And these are from my colleague Jessica Elgot. On the BBC’s World at One Andrew Mitchell, the Conservative former international development secretary who tabled the amendment to restore the 0.7% aid spending target next year, said that reports this morning that his amendment would definitely not be allowed (see 10.38am) were premature. Mitchell said that he met Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Commons Speaker, this morning to argue why it should be allowed and that Hoyle would not be making his decision until a meeting starting at 1.30pm. Here are some of the other points he made. Mitchell claimed that the pro-government briefing about his amendment being disallowed was premature, and could be counter-productive. He told the programme: Certainly, some of the briefing that he’s already made up his mind seeks to trespass on Mr Speaker’s authority. He won’t have liked that very much. He said that his amendment was “clearly in order”, because it was allowed on the order paper, and that whether or not it was in scope (see 11.33am) was only one factor to be taken into account. He said other issues could include “parliament’s relationship with the executive” - a reference to the fact ministers proposed cutting aid spending without giving MPs a vote on the issue. He said that, if Hoyle did allow the amendment to be put to a vote, he would not have to publish a statement explaining why he was ignoring existing parliamentary conventions. When Hoyle became Speaker, he promised to do this if he took a decision overturning standing orders or breaking “long-established” conventions. Mitchell said that he had been told this decision would not cross that threshold. That suggests the advice from Hoyle’s officials is not absolute, and that it might be arguable that the amendment should be allowed. Mitchell said Hoyle should take into account that at the 2019 election government and opposition MPs were all elected promising to keep aid spending at 0.7% of national income. The Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, has said that a third Covid wave is expected “later in the summer and into the autumn”, adding: “The more people mix and meet, the more people will fall ill.” But he said the peak would be “much flatter”. There are 97 cases of the Delta variant in Wales, with a worrying cluster in Conwy in the north. Drakeford said the government was confident the vaccination programme was breaking the link between Covid and the Alpha variant, first discovered in Kent, but he said it was less clear if the programme suppressed the Delta variant as effectively. Here is a summary of the key points from the Downing Street lobby briefing. Boris Johnson wants to stop using the term “special relationship” to discuss the alliance with the US, No 10 confirmed. (See 1.03pm.) No 10 hinted that aid spending could exceed the downgraded target of 0.5% of gross national income when the donation of coronavirus vaccines is taken into account. As PA Media reports, the PM’s spokesman said: “You can expect the PM to set out more details at the G7 this week on the UK’s plans to share surplus doses with developing countries.” Asked if it would be on top of the existing aid budget, the spokesman said: “The £10bn has been largely allocated in the spending plans already set out with regards to ODA funding, but I’m not going to jump ahead of what the PM might say later this week with regards to the commitment.” The spokesman refused to condemn football supporters who booed England players taking the knee. He said that the PM was urging people to “get behind” the England team, but that he also respected the right of people to protest peacefully. Asked whether Johnson believed that taking a knee showed support for the political aims of the Black Lives Matter movement, the spokesman said: The prime minister’s spoken on the record on this issue before. On taking the knee, specifically, the prime minister is more focused on action rather than gestures. We have taken action with things like the Commission on Racial and Ethnic Disparities and that’s what he’s focused on delivering. The spokesman said Johnson was “supportive” of Oliver Dowden’s comment this morning accusing the ECB of going “over the top” by suspending the bowler Ollie Robinson from international cricket over racist and sexist tweets posted in 2012 and 2013. Here is Dowden’s own tweet on the matter. The spokesman said data emerging this week would be crucial in deciding whether all Covid restrictions in England can be lifted on 21 June as planned. He said: There still remains that there is nothing in the data currently to suggest step 4 can’t go ahead at the earliest date. But we do need to look very closely at the data over this coming week, which will be crucial to decide and really to get a sense of the data, particularly on hospitalisations and whether or not the excellent vaccine rollout programme has sufficiently severed that link between the increase in cases, which we always expected to happen, particularly after step 3, and that subsequently leading to hospitalisations and deaths. At the briefing the spokesman seemed to place particular emphasis on the word “currently”. The spokesman said there were no plans to reduce the time between first vaccines and second vaccines for the under-50s. The spokesman did not deny reports that ministers over-ruled a recommendation from the Joint Biosecurity Centre last week for Malta to be added to the green list for travel. Boris Johnson does not like the term “special relationship” to describe the UK’s alliance with the US, Downing Street has confirmed. At the No 10 lobby briefing the PM’s spokesperson confirmed this was Johnson’s view, and did not deny that Johnson viewed the phrase as “needy” and “weak”. The claim was first made in the Atlantic profile of Johnson by Tom McTague published today. (See 12.14pm.) McTague wrote: In an early phone call with Joe Biden, an aide told me, Johnson said he disliked the phrase special relationship after the president used it. To Johnson it seemed needy and weak. Asked if this was true, the spokesperson claimed that this was a view Johnson has expressed before. He said: The prime minister is on the record previously saying he prefers not to use the phrase but that in no way detracts from the importance with which we regard our relationship with the US, our closest ally. The spokesperson did not deny that Johnson had described the phrase, which has been used by leaders from Winston Churchill onwards, as needy and weak. Asked about this, the spokesperson just repeated that Johnson preferred not to use the phrase. Asked if Johnson wanted the media to stop using the phrase, the spokesperson replied: I don’t think the prime minister would entertainment the prospect of trying to tell the media what to say. Although Johnson may have expressed reservations about the phrase before, these have never been well-publicised and it did not stop the White House using the phrase when it briefed on Joe Biden’s first conversation with Johnson after be became president. The two men will meet for the first time this week, as Johnson hosts the G7 in Cornwall, and it will be interesting to see if they can get through it without deploying the phrase again. I will post more from the lobby briefing soon. All over-18s will be offered a Covid vaccine by the start of next week, the Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, has said. Figures published today show 2.18 million people, or 86% of the adult population in Wales, have had a first dose and almost 1.25 million people have had a second dose. Take-up is higher than 90% for first doses in all people over 60; in healthcare workers; care home residents and staff and all those who are extremely clinically vulnerable. Drakeford said: I am very proud to say that Wales has one of the best Covid vaccination programmes in the world. We will make the offer of vaccination to all eligible adults six weeks ahead of schedule and we expect to reach 75% take-up across all priority groups and age groups a month ahead of target. This is a remarkable achievement and a tribute to the hard work of all those involved in the programme – to all those doing the complex work of planning behind the scenes and to the thousands of people vaccinating and helping to run the clinics across the country. We’ll hear about the fate of the Tory rebel amendment on aid spending at 1.30pm, the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg reports. There will be two statements in the Commons this afternoon before the debate on the the advanced research and innovation agency bill starts. The Atlantic’s Tom McTague has published a 7,000-word profile of Boris Johnson, partly based on multiple interviews with him. McTague has summarised some of his key findings in a Twitter thread starting here. People from Pakistani and Bangladeshi backgrounds have the lowest rates of receiving a second dose of Covid-19 vaccine among all ethnic minority groups in England, PA Media reports. PA says: Among people aged 70 and over, 82.4% of people from a Pakistani background with a first dose of vaccine were likely to have received a second dose by 9 May, along with 82.7% of those from a Bangladeshi background. The equivalent rate for people identifying as white British is 96.3%. The figures, from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), also suggest 84.0% of people identifying as black African who had received a first dose of vaccine went on to receive a second dose, along with 87.0% of those identifying as black Caribbean. These are from the BBC’s Iain Watson with the latest he’s learned on the fate of the Tory rebel amendment on aid spending. Covid-19 case rates are rising in more local areas of the UK than at any point since early January, with numbers increasing in almost all parts of north-west England, London and Scotland, PA Media reports. PA says: The figures come as health secretary Matt Hancock indicated ministers at Westminster were open to delaying the easing of restrictions in England scheduled for June 21, while the Scottish government has paused a relaxing of rules in parts of central Scotland. The rise in rates has yet to be mirrored by a steady increase in Covid-19 hospital cases, however, with the latest data showing patient numbers have climbed slightly to levels last seen at the end of May. Nearly three-quarters of local areas of the UK (283 out of 380) recorded a week-on-week rise in Covid-19 case rates for the seven days to 2 June. This is the highest proportion since 6 January. In just under half of these places (134), the rise was small enough to be in single figures. But a growing number of areas are recording sharp jumps in rates, some of them large enough to push them above the symbolic level of 100 cases per 100,000 people When using a seven-day average to flatten out fluctuations in the data, 256 of 380 local areas in the UK are currently recording a rise in rates - the highest number since 10 January. And this is from one of Hannah White’s colleague at the Institute for Government thinktank, Alice Lilly. These are from Hannah White, the parliament specialist at the Institute for Government thinktank and a former Commons clerk. Boris Johnson was calling some of the Tory MPs planning to rebel on the aid spending amendment asking them to back the government, the Evening Standard’s Joe Murphy reports. Andrew Mitchell, the Conservative former international development secretary who tabled the rebel amendment on aid, told Sky News that he had been told by the Speaker that no decision has yet been taken about whether it will be allowed. But Tory sources are briefing that Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, is being strongly advised that the amendment should be rejected. We have not had official confirmation yet that the rebel Tory aid amendment will not be allowed, but this is what is being briefed by reliable sources this morning. The decision is related to the Commons concept of the “scope” of a bill. This is what Erskine May, the Commons procedural rule book, says about scope. The scope of a bill represents the reasonable limits of its collective purposes, as defined by its existing clauses and schedules. In particular cases, difficult questions of judgment may arise. The scope of a bill, particularly of a bill with several purposes, may be wider than its long title, although the long title may help to determine the scope. Conversely, a bill with a single purpose may have a narrow scope even though the long title is apparently wide (for example, ‘a Bill to amend a certain Act’). Amendments are not allowed if they are out of scope. But deciding whether or not an amendment is within scope is not straightforward. An amendment to a clause may be inadmissible because it is not relevant to that clause, but it might be acceptable if tabled in a different form (as a new clause) because it is within the scope of the bill as a whole. And, as a bill goes through parliament, its scope can widen; one amendment may push the door open for others. And at least two stages are involved in deciding if an amendment is in scope. If it clearly isn’t, the clerks will not allow it to be tabled (printed on the order paper). But getting an amendment onto the order paper does not mean it will be put to the vote because the Speaker takes the final decision ahead of the debate, on the advice of clerks. This morning they have reportedly told him the aid amendment is inadmissible. Their advice, like government legal advice, is strictly private, but one test is whether passing an amendment would change the nature of the whole bill. Passing this amendment would effectively turn the advanced research and innovation agency bill into the aid spending bill, and so getting it accepted was probably always a long shot (although the MPs behind it had no incentive to admit it). The Speaker can decide to over-rule the advice he gets. John Bercow did this during the Brexit process, generating huge controversy. But when Sir Lindsay Hoyle was elected to replace him, he promised to show more respect for existing convention, and said that if he ever did divert from current procedure (as Bercow did), he would publish a statement explaining why. It is not something he has ever had to do. Here is my colleague Jessica Elgot’s story about the advice that the rebel amendment on aid spending should not be put to a vote. Here is more on the decision from the Speaker. This is from the Times’ Steven Swinford. And this is from the Telegraph’s Lucy Fisher. Boris Johnson no longer faces a Commons revolt tonight because the Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, has decided not to call the amendment on the grounds that it is outside the scope of the bill’s purpose, my colleague Jessica Elgot reports. Lisa Nandy, the shadow foreign secretary, told Sky News this morning that cutting the aid budget was not in the UK’s interests. She said: The government is making a real mistake, they’re about to go into the most important week in many, many months, the G7, with a major plank of global Britain in tatters. [Boris Johnson] could change his mind, he could reverse this, he could just admit that cutting global aid in the middle of a pandemic is the wrong thing to do. It’s short-sighted, it’s not in Britain’s interest and he could solve this very quickly. Gordon Brown, the former Labour prime minister, restated his opposition to the government’s cut in aid spending in an interview this morning. He told BBC Breakfast: It’s a life-and-death issue, we’re actually deciding who lives and who dies, particularly at this point where if we withdraw the money for vaccination it’s the equivalent of pulling away the needle from a kid or from an adult who is sick who needs the vaccination, a 90% cut, for example, in support for polio vaccination. There has been an all-party consensus, all parties, for 25 years that we need 0.7%, we need to play our role in the world by being one of the leaders in aid and, really, this is not the right time to pull things away because basically this is when the poorest countries need help most. Lucy Frazer, the solicitor general, was on the morning interview round on behalf of No 10 and, when asked about the prospect of ministers trying to “buy off” tonight’s planned rebellion by promising to restore the aid cuts next year (see 9.21am), she played down the prospect. When this proposal was put to her, she told the Today programme: It’s good to have the flexibility [ie, the option of spending less than 0.7% of national income on aid]. Interestingly, in the legislation as it stands [the bill enshrining the 0.7% target], it does commit to 0.7%, but it does recognise in that legislation that if the economical fiscal circumstances change, then it is open to the chancellor to change that spending. She also stressed the cut was temporary. She told Sky News: Even without the 0.7% this year we will be investing 10 billion and that is really important, but we are in the middle of a pandemic. What we’ve said is of course international aid needs to be spent but we’re going to temporarily cease the 0.7% and bring it back when fiscal circumstances allow. Good morning. Tonight MPs may get the chance to vote on an amendment to the advanced research and innovation agency bill to restore the 0.7% aid spending target next year and, if they do, the Tory rebels supporting it are confident that the government will lose. That is what one of their leaders, David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, told the Today programme this morning. Asked if he was confident that that the government would lose if there were a vote, he replied: Yes, I’m pretty sure. I am certain that there’s a majority of people who want the government to change this policy. Of course the whips do their worst. But I think they will still win. Here is my colleague Patrick Wintour’s overnight preview story. And this is what Patrick tweeted on this this morning. But that does not mean a defeat is inevitable. In fact there are three outcomes that are all quite possible. They are: 1) Ministers could “buy off” the rebels by promising to reverse the aid cut next year. They have already said that the cut (from 0.7% of national income to 0.5%) is only temporary, but there are suspicions that by this Boris Johnson means temporary in the sense that income tax was temporary when William Pitt introduced it to fund the Napoleonic War. 2) The Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, may decide not to put the amendment to a vote. Commons officials have allowed the amendment to be tabled, which suggests that it is within the “scope” of the bill (ie, not irrelevant to the topic it covers). But that does not automatically mean it will be selected, even though a large number of MPs want it put to the vote. The Speaker also has to make a judgment about whether it is relevant to the purpose of the bill, and if he concludes that it isn’t - because it would effectively turn a science research bill into an aid spending bill - he can reject it. 3) The government could push the amendment to the vote, and lose. Although this would be embarrassing for Johnson, there would be two consolatory bonuses: it would stop this issue overshadowing the G7 summit later this week, and it would reinforce Johnson’s claim to be a leader championing the wishes of the public (voters overwhelmingly support the aid spending cut) in the face of obstruction from a supposedly out-of-touch parliament. There are two other outcomes that are less probable. 4) The government could push the amendment to a vote without offering any compromise - and squeak a narrow win. 5) Ministers could abandon the bill altogether. The final option is highly unlikely although, given that the only person in government who was truly committed to setting up the advanced research and innovation agency was Dominic Cummings, Johnson must find the idea tempting. (One reason why he was willing to cut aid spending in the first place, despite the Tory manifesto saying it should stay at 0.7%, was because higher aid spending was a policy associated with David Cameron, another of his arch rivals.) Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: The ONS publishes figures on vaccination rates amongst the over-70s by class. 10.30am: Dr Bola Owolabi, director of health inequalities for NHS England, speaks at a seminar on about vaccine confidence amongst people from African, Bangladeshi, Caribbean and Pakistani backgrounds. 12pm: Downing Street is expected to hold its daily lobby briefing. 2.30pm: Matthew Rycroft, permanent secretary at the Home Office, gives evidence to the public accounts committee about the Windrush compensation scheme. 2.30pm: Priti Patel, the home secretary, takes questions in the Commons. 2.30pm: Sir Keir Starmer gives a speech to the GMB conference. After 3.30pm: MPs begin debating the remaining stages of the advanced research and invention agency bill. The amendment requiring the government to restore the 0.7% aid spending target next year may be put to a vote before 10pm.

UPDATE: I have amended the paragraph starting 2) to say the fact that the clerks allowed the bill to be tabled suggested the amendment was in scope, rather than confirmed it.

Each of the first two sets lasted more than an hour. Has Musetti got anything left in the tank? We’ll find out. On Suzanne-Lenglen, Sofia Kenin is in big trouble early on – she’s 4-0 down to Maria Sakkari in the first set. Fourth set: *Djokovic 6-7, 6-7, 6-1, 5-0 Musetti He does get on the board on his first service point – just the 10th point he’s won since claiming the second set. He works his way to 40-15, then Djokovic slaps a backhand return down the line. Deuce, then break point as a drop shot gives Musetti too much to do. He repeats the trick, and it’s five-love Djokovic. Fourth set: Djokovic 6-7, 6-7, 6-1, 4-0 Musetti* It’s another Djokovic hold to love, and Musetti hasn’t won a single point in this set yet. Fourth set: *Djokovic 6-7, 6-7, 6-1, 3-0 Musetti I know Djokovic is the world No 1, and Lorenzo Musetti is in uncharted slam territory – but I can’t recall a match turning around this fast. Musetti is broken to love again, barely able to get a racket on anything and looking completely defeated. Fourth set: Djokovic 6-7, 6-7, 6-1, 2-0 Musetti* Djokovic rattles through a service hold to love; he’s won 24 of the last 27 points. Fourth set: *Djokovic 6-7, 6-7, 6-1, 1-0 Musetti Just as Djokovic has improved, Musetti has lost his way, and he opens the fourth set with an error-strewn service game. Djokovic, giving nothing away cheaply now, powers to a break to love. It’s fair to say the momentum has shifted. In case you missed it earlier, Coco Gauff raced past Ons Jabeur to reach her first slam quarter-final. She will face the Czech, Barbora Krejcikova, who beat Sloane Stephens so comprehensively that she’s already back on court in the mixed doubles. Musetti goes long from a big Djokovic serve, and the Serb has cut the deficit in a 23-minute set. The next few games feel like they will be pivotal. Third set: *Djokovic 6-7, 6-7, 5-1 Musetti Is Musetti starting to think about the next set? Yes, would seem to be the answer, as Djokovic secures the double break. He’ll serve for the third set, which has lasted barely 20 minutes. Over on Suzanne-Lenglen last year’s finalist, Sofia Kenin, is about to get under way against Greece’s Maria Sakkari. A potential final rematch with Iga Swiatek awaits in the next round; the champion plays Marta Kostyuk in the evening game. Third set: Djokovic 6-7, 6-7, 4-1 Musetti* Djokovic has shaken off the weird funk from the first two sets and is now dominating the points. A test of Musetti’s resolve here; can he keep finding ways to trouble the world No 1? Third set: *Djokovic 6-7, 6-7, 3-1 Musetti A welcome hold for Musetti to get on the board in this third set. A word for Britain’s Alfie Hewett, who has seen off Shingo Kunieda 6-3, 6-4 in the men’s wheelchair final to win his second straight French Open, and his fifth singles slam overall. Hewett also won the men’s doubles final on Sunday with partner Gordon Reid. Chapeau, Alfie. Third set: Djokovic 6-7, 6-7, 3-0 Musetti* Djokovic looks a much tougher prospect now, his forehand cleaner and movement sharper. Musetti keeps him guessing with some elegant drop shots, but it’s a comfortable hold. Third set: *Djokovic 6-7, 6-7, 2-0 Musetti This looks more like the Djokovic we know, springing around the court, throwing his hands up theatrically as Musetti finds the baseline, and closing down a drop shot to set up break point. He takes it as Musetti fires an ambitious cross-courter wide! Third set: Djokovic 6-7, 6-7, 1-0 Musetti* (*denotes next server) A welcome, trouble-free hold for Djokovic, who hasn’t found his A-game at all so far. Diego Schwartzman comes through a three-hour slugfest with Jan-Lennard Struff, who missed seven set points in the opener and never really recovered. Next up for Schwartzman: Rafa Nadal or Jannik Sinner in the quarter-finals. Djokovic skews a half-hearted volley wide to present Musetti with five set points. He takes the second one with a serve out wide. Djokovic promptly heads to the dressing room to gather his thoughts. This is really on now! Second-set tiebreak: Djokovic 1-5 Musetti The Italian grabs an early point on the Djokovic serve, then follows it up with some absurd defensive work, and a looping lob that somehow clips the baseline. Djokovic then goes long, and Musetti is 4-0 up! Djokovic pulls one back, and should bury the next point, but he lets Musetti back in and pays the price ... It’s five-one at the change of ends. Second set: Djokovic 6-7, 6-6 Musetti It’s a nerveless love-hold from Djokovic, and we’re heading for another tie-break ... Second set: *Djokovic 6-7, 5-6 Musetti Thanks, Gregg. You would expect Djokovic to turn up the heat here, but it’s still very scrappy from the world No 1 and Musetti holds comfortably, aided by an absolute ripper of a cross-court winner that has Djokovic shaking his head in disbelief. Second set: Djokovic 6-7, 5-5 Musetti* This is a strong hold for Djokovic under intense pressure. He’s still struggling to land his first serve as regularly as he’d like but some good craft in the rallies forces his younger opponent to swipe long. A bad miss at the net by the world No 1 makes it a bit more nervy than he’d like but he holds to 30 with an overhead smash. I’ll hand back to Niall now. Thanks. Second set: *Djokovic 6-7, 4-5 Musetti Excellent again from Musetti. Djokovic pounces on a weak second serve to level the game at 30-30. Musetti responds with a deep forehand that Djokovic handles like it’s a grenade, landing it limply back centre court, where Musetti smashes it into the corner before finding another winner to take the game. Djokovic will have to serve to stay in the second set. Second set: Djokovic 6-7, 4-4 Musetti* Struff is battling to stay in the match against Diego Schwartzman on Suzanne-Lenglen. He trails 4-3 but it’s on serve. Back on Philippe-Chatrier there’s a delightful little rally at the net that Musetti wins to get back into this game at 30-30. Musetti pounces on Djokovic’s second serve to dominate the following rally before hammering an overhand winner into the corner to bring up a break point. He can’t take it though, hitting long when he was in a good position mid-rally. The world No 1 keeps his composure, sending his much younger opponent running for errands to hold. Second set: *Djokovic 6-7, 3-4 Musetti Musetti holds to 30 to get his head in front again in this entertaining second set. He varied his serve well and gave little away for Djokovic to attack. Second set: Djokovic 6-7, 3-3 Musetti* This is so good! Djokovic uses all his experience to give the 19-year-old the runaround with some feather-fingered drop shots to lead 30-0. Musetti responds with some improvisation by dinking a winner back the way it came and then a jabbed backhand past his opponent to level at 30-30. He then clatters a forehand into the corner to bring up another break point. What chutzpah! Djokovic holds his nerve though, landing three first serves to hold and level the set. Second set: *Djokovic 6-7, 2-3 Musetti But Djokovic bounces back! Musetti is wild in this game and the No 1 seed keeps his composure to break him to love. Second set: Djokovic 6-7, 1-3 Musetti* Over on Suzanne-Lenglen, Diego Schwartzman has raced into a 3-0 lead in the third set and looks like he’ll be booking his place in the quarter-finals. Back on Court Philippe-Chatrier, Djokovic has been broken again! Djokovic’s first serve was off and his second serve was a gift for Musetti, who battered it back and took control of the game. Djokovic is in real trouble. Second set: *Djokovic 6-7, 1-2 Musetti What a game that was! After going 0-30 behind, Musetti produces a wonderful drop shot and an incredible half-volley to level up at 30-30. Djokovic’s head droops and Musetti pounds his way to a 2-1 lead in the second set. Second set: Djokovic 6-7, 1-1 Musetti* Thanks Niall. Djokovic is continuing to make hard work of all he does. He hammers a lame backhand into the net to go 15-30 behind but digs deep and rallies to level up the second set by holding to 30. Second set: *Djokovic 6-7, 0-1 Musetti The teenager carries on as before in the second set, gliding in behind a drop shot and flicking it away to seal a comfortable hold. On Suzanne-Lenglen, Diego Schwartzman has taken the second set against Struff, and leads 7-6, 6-4. With that, I’ll hand over to Gregg Bakowski ... “Wow, Musetti is the real deal,” says Luke Forrester. “Still only a teenager but very much Djokovic’s equal in this match so far. Keeping this up for a best-of-five will probably be too much for him at this stage in his career but he’s a real prospect.” He has hit a lot of very stylish winners, but equally impressive has been the points where he has ground something out. He just looks very comfortable out there. Musetti wins the first set 7-6 (9-7)! Good grief. Musetti digs in, keeping himself in the rally, and then unleashes a cross-court winner. He’s taken the first set, and deservedly so. What a performance so far! First-set tiebreak: Djokovic 7-8 Musetti Djokovic saves it by a millimetre, clipping the line with an awkward, rangy forehand. On serve, Djokovic goes for a winner down the line – and misses. Another set point for Musetti, this time on serve – but Djokovic saves with a clinical drop shot. Musetti responds, scrambling through the next rally to earn a third set point ... First-set tiebreak: Djokovic 5-6 Musetti Djokovic leaves a return short and Musetti pummels it away for a winner. Can he get back on serve? He can, winning a strange point amid moon balls and mishits from Djokovic. The No 1 tries a cross-court slice but Musetti reads it, and gets a set point as Djokovic nets! First-set tiebreak: Djokovic 4-2 Musetti The Italian has an 8-0 career record in tie breaks. Can he make it nine? Djokovic edges ahead with a drop shot that spins off at a right angle, then muffs a routine return. He does enough on his next two points, on serve, to open a three-point lead. Musetti responds by ripping a backhand down the line! First set: Djokovic 6-6 Musetti Djokovic can only chuckle to himself as Musetti lands a looping cross-court winner from an impossible angle. A big serve out wide seals a hold to 15, and it’s tie-break time ... First set: Djokovic 6-5 Musetti* (*denotes next server) A lovely angled return puts Musetti 15-30 up, but Djokovic quickly closes the door. Can the Italian force a tie-break? First set: *Djokovic 5-5 Musetti (*denotes next server) At 30-all, Djokovic looks primed to pounce – but a change of pace from Musetti gets the job done. The No 1 seed not firing on all cylinders yet. First set: Djokovic 5-4 Musetti* (*denotes next server) A quickfire hold to love for Djokovic, cranking up the heat on his opponent. Over on Lenglen, Schwartzman and Struff are locked at 2-2 in the second. That one might take a while. First set: *Djokovic 4-4 Musetti (*denotes next server) Musetti races to 40-0, going for his shots and making them, but then tries to be a little too ambitious, a series of narrow misses allowing Djokovic back in. At deuce, Djokovic thinks he has this figured out – but Musetti surprises him again, grinding out two long rallies to hold. First set: Djokovic 4-3 Musetti* (*denotes next server) Musetti holds serve, playing with a flair and freedom that has Djokovic a little rattled. In the next game, a peach of a backhand volley has Djokovic applauding, but he’s less charitable on the other points, holding to 15. Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and Elena Rybakina face each other in the singles quarter-finals on Tuesday. This afternoon, they’re teaming up in the women’s doubles. It’s unusual preparation, that’s for sure. Switching focus back to Chatrier, where Djokovic is being made to work hard by Musetti. The Italian is covering a lot of ground – even stumbling over an advertising board at one point – and takes Djokovic to deuce. His variety of shots is causing problems – and he gets the break back as Djokovic sends a backhand into the net! Back on serve, Djokovic 3-2 up. Out on court 12, Alfie Hewett has taken the first set against Shingo Kunieda in the men’s wheelchair final. Hewett won the men’s doubles with Gordon Reid on Sunday, and is a set away from a double slam triumph. Schwartzman wins the first set 7-6 (11-9)! It’s just not meant to be for Struff, who had his first set points some 40 minutes ago. First, his return clips the net cord and drops the wrong side - then Schwartzman’s backhand does the same, and loops over the net. He’s won the set from 5-1 down, saving (I think) seven set points on the way. Back on Chatrier, Djokovic has taken charge of the first set, breaking Musetti to lead 3-1. Schwartzman and Struff are locked in a tie-break that either player will be sorely disappointed to lose. Both players miss set points and stay locked together at 9-9 ... Musetti holds his first service game, closing out with a hefty ace straight down the middle. Into a tie-break on Lenglen, and Schwartzman races into a 3-0 lead – then has a wobble of his own as unforced errors allow Struff back to 3-3 ... Musetti has beaten David Goffin and Marco Cecchinato, conqueror of Djokovic in 2018, on his way to the last 16. He makes quite the start here, pounding a winner down the line on Djokovic’s first service point. He takes the world No 1 to deuce but Djokovic scraps his way through, finding the power to keep Musetti on the back foot. While Djokovic and Musetti knock up on Chatrier, Schwartzman has Struff on the rack at 5-5 but the German finds an ace to hold. We could be heading for a tie-break ... Schwartzman is still scrapping away in the first set, and now has a break point at 5-3 down. Struff double-faults, the nerves a-jangling, and we’re back on serve! Next up on Philippe-Chatrier, it’s world No 1 Novak Djokovic against rising star Lorenzo Musetti. Naturally, Djokovic is the hot favourite – but his Italian opponent has beaten some big names already in his 18 months on the tour. Struff serving for the set on Suzanne-Lenglen at 5-1 up. Schwartzman saves four set points, and gets a break back with some vicious groundstrokes. Still a long way to go to rescue this first set, though ... “I’m super happy, I played really well today,” says Gauff. Asked how her family help her with life in the bubble, she says: “it’s important to have fun. We play Uno every night, and I win all the time.” Coco Gauff wants to get the job done quickly, and after holding to 30 she quickly picks up two match points against an increasingly error-prone opponent. Jabeur saves them both, and a third when Gauff sends a forehand long. A slow-motion Jabeur second serve is dispatched and Gauff digs in on the next rally to seal victory! Schwartzman under a little pressure early on, taken to a third deuce by Struff. The No 10 seed nets a scratchy slice from the back of the court, then double faults. Struff leads 3-1 in the first set. At 30-15 on her own serve, Jabeur sees the match swept away from her in three straight points. First, a poor cross-court lob drops wide; then Gauff sets up break point with a pinpoint backhand return down the line. At the net, Gauff shows great hands to clip a volley onto the line. She has a double break, and leads 6-3, 4-1. Gauff motors to 40-0 then has her first slight wobble on serve as Jabeur rallies to 40-30. Gauff gets the job done as Jabeur nets, another costly unforced error. Jabeur gets on the board with a service hold, not that Gauff will be too concerned; she has looked rock-solid on her own serve so far. On Lenglen, Jan-Lennard Struff opens with a love hold against Diego Schwartzman. The German beat Andrey Rublev on his way here, and is a dangerous opponent. Jabeur starts the second set with a double double-fault, and Gauff claims the break with a ferocious finishing volley. It gets no better for Jabeur on the Gauff serve, her drop shots chased down and her attempted passes cut out clinically. Gauff leads 6-3, 2-0 ... Out on court 12, Dylan Alcott has won the quad wheelchair men’s singles title, beating Dutchman Sam Schroder 6-4, 6-2. It’s the Australian’s third straight French Open win, and his 14th grand slam title. Next up: Britain’s Alfie Hewett takes on Japan’s Shingo Kunieda in the men’s wheelchair final. Kunieda has won this tournament seven times before, so Hewett has his work cut out. Gauff closes out the first set in style, taking it 6-3. She lost just two points on her first serve, and three on her second, in that set. Jabeur does get a drop-shot right, a lovely effort from the back of the court. It’s a rare moment of resistance in another dominant Gauff service game; the American leads 5-2 in the first set. Up next on Lenglen it’s Diego Schwarzman, who faces Germany’s Jan-Lennard Struff. The Argentinian got to the semi-finals last year before running into Rafa Nadal, who may well be waiting in the quarter-finals this time. Time to head over to Chatrier, where Coco Gauff has made a lightning start. Having broken Jabeur in the second game, she leads 4-1 and looks dominant on serve. Jabeur is relying on drop shots to turn points in her favour; it’s not working so far. Krejcikova is having quite the fortnight in Paris; she’s into the quarter-finals in the singles and doubles. “I hope you’ve been entertained,” she tells an appreciative crowd. She insists it was a close game despite the scoreline. “It’s always fun to play here ... I’m looking forward to playing another one.” Krejcikova finds her first ace, then scraps her way to match point. Stephens saves the first, but the Czech takes her next opportunity with another dominant rally. Gauff opens with a comfortable service hold on Chatrier, while Stephens takes the first two points as Krejcikova looks to serve out the match ... It looks as though Krejcikova will be waiting in the quarters for either Gauff or Jabeur; the Czech is cruising to victory over Sloane Stephens, whose unforced error count has crept over 20. Stephens tries to mix it up with a couple of nice drop shots, but as soon as she’s drawn into a rally there looks only one winner. Krejcikova breaks again, and will serve for the match. Coco Gauff walks out onto Chatrier, where she will take on Tunisia’s Ons Jabeur. Gauff won the 2018 juniors’ title here, and is targeting a first grand slam quarter-final place as a professional. Stephens’ serve is unravelling under the pressure, and Krejcikova breaks again with a punchy winner into the corner. She leads 6-2, 3-0 and this one looks over after less than an hour on court. There’s no early second-set dip from Krejcikova, who immediately breaks Stephens, then backs it up with a hold. She’s been very consistent in the longer rallies, forcing Stephens to take on risky shots that she’s not making. Krejcikova wins the first set, 6-2! Stephens holds serve comfortably but can’t make inroads as Krejcikova serves for the net. She tries a little too hard, sending two ambitious efforts into the tramlines, and Krejcikova wraps up the first set with a fine, angled volley. Stephens gets a break point but unforced errors keep costing her, as she nets twice in a row. Krejcikova dominates the next rally, and it’s 5-1. Krejcikova is an accomplished doubles player, winning multiple slams in the women’s and mixed events. She’s now making strides on the singles tour, reaching the final in Dubai, winning in Strasbourg and eliminating Elina Svitolina in the last round here. Krejcikova makes it a double break, holding steady and waiting for the erratic Stephens to blink. She sends a forehand long, and it’s 4-1 to her opponent in the first set. A very solid start from Krejcikova, who has found her rhythm quickly. She breaks after a marathon opening game, then follows up with a hold to love. Sunday saw Serena Williams and Roger Federer bow out, with Federer withdrawing before his fourth-round match against Matteo Berrettini. Ons Jabeur and Coco Gauff will begin at 11am (BST), but over on Suzanne-Lenglen, play has already started. Sloane Stephens, a former finalist here who has slipped down the rankings, is taking on world No 33 Barbora Krejcikova in a battle between two unseeded players. Court Philippe-Chatrier [25] Ons Jabeur v Coco Gauff [24] [1] Novak Djokovic v Lorenzo Musetti [3] Rafael Nadal v Jannik Sinner [18] Evening: Marta Kostyuk v Iga Swiatek [8] Court Suzanne-Lenglen Sloane Stephens v Barbora Krejcikova [10] Diego Schwartzman v Jan-Lennard Struff [4] Sofia Kenin v Maria Sakkari [17] Bonjour, tout le monde. Novak Djokovic and Rafa Nadal have successfully held off the Next Gen – but what about the Next Next Gen? Both players face teenagers today, with Djokovic up against Lorenzo Musetti before Nadal plays Jannik Sinner. Both are Italian, and both were three years old when Nadal first won the French Open in 2005. There are more slam winners in action today, in the form of Sloane Stephens (who will be on court momentarily) and Sofia Kenin, who plays Greece’s Maria Sakkari. There’s plenty of US interest, even with Serena Williams going home – not least in Coco Gauff, chasing her first slam quarter final place today. Gauff wasn’t born when Serena first won here in 2002. Life, it comes at you fast.","charCount":"21221","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/niall-mcveigh\">Niall McVeigh</a> (now) and <a href=\"profile/gregg-bakowski\">Gregg Bakowski</a> (briefly)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/live/2021/jun/07/coronavirus-live-news-spain-reopens-to-vaccinated-tourists-as-taiwan-extends-pandemic-restrictions","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-07T14:29:55Z","webTitle":"Coronavirus live news: Indian PM Modi announces free jabs for all over-18s; Norway to shorten vaccine interval","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2021/jun/07/coronavirus-live-news-spain-reopens-to-vaccinated-tourists-as-taiwan-extends-pandemic-restrictions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2021/jun/07/coronavirus-live-news-spain-reopens-to-vaccinated-tourists-as-taiwan-extends-pandemic-restrictions","fields":{"headline":"Coronavirus live news: Indian PM Modi announces free jabs for all over-18s; Norway to shorten vaccine interval","standfirst":"<p>Modi’s announcement is a<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2021/jun/07/coronavirus-live-news-spain-reopens-to-vaccinated-tourists-as-taiwan-extends-pandemic-restrictions?page=with:block-60be192c8f082ac930aecf28#block-60be192c8f082ac930aecf28\"> U-turn amid criticism of vaccine rollout</a>; Norway announces <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2021/jun/07/coronavirus-live-news-spain-reopens-to-vaccinated-tourists-as-taiwan-extends-pandemic-restrictions?page=with:block-60be05628f082e80569f8d4e#block-60be05628f082e80569f8d4e\">move to speed up rollout </a></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/jun/07/spat-at-abused-attacked-healthcare-staff-face-rising-violence-during-covid\">Spat at, attacked: health staff face rising violence during Covid</a> </li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/07/children-covid-vulnerable-host-cases-recede-us\">Children are vulnerable host for Covid as cases recede, scientists warn</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/jun/07/scientists-urge-caution-after-tony-blair-backs-uk-covid-pass\">Scientists urge caution after Tony Blair backs UK ‘Covid pass’</a> </li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul>","trailText":"Modi’s announcement is a U-turn amid criticism of vaccine rollout; Norway announces move to speed up rollout ","byline":"Lucy Campbell (now), Mattha Busby, Martin Belam andHelen Davidson (earlier)","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"542f09a7748ef3a1fc2c9e146278d5adbdeba731\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/542f09a7748ef3a1fc2c9e146278d5adbdeba731/0_64_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Students of a private school receive a Covid vaccine in Kolkata, India.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Students of a private school receive a Covid vaccine in Kolkata, India.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Xinhua/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<div id=\"block-60be2c9e8f082ac930aed090\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-07T14:29:55.557Z\">3.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In a subject close to my heart, the bosses of all airlines flying passenger services between the <strong>UK</strong> and the <strong>US</strong> have called for their governments to relax Covid-19 restrictions to reopen travel routes between the two countries, Reuters reports.</p> <p>After more than a year of restrictions, the CEOs of American Airlines, IAG unit British Airways, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and JetBlue Airways Corp said high vaccination rates in both countries meant travel could restart safely.</p> <p>The push for reopening trans-Atlantic routes on Monday comes ahead of meetings between the US president <strong>Joe Biden</strong> and the British prime minister <strong>Boris Johnson</strong> at the G7 meeting of advanced economies later this week in Cornwall, southwest England, this week.</p> <p>The pair must use those meetings to agree to restart travel, British Airways chief executive Sean Doyle said in a statement ahead of an online press conference.</p> <p>“We urgently need them to look to the science and base their judgements on a proper risk analysis, allowing us all to benefit from the protection offered by our successful vaccine rollouts,” Doyle said.</p> <p>Since March 2020, the US has barred nearly all non-US citizens who have been in the UK within the previous 14 days from entering the country.

He urged workers to take advantage of multilingual information apps.</p> <p>There are 64 aged care facilities with recorded cases, including 48 employees and more than 146 others, including residents.</p> <p>Chen said Moderna vaccines will start being distributed in Wednesday, prioritising vulnerable groups for a set period of time before widening the eligibility, as opposed to waiting until everyone in that group is vaccinated. <br></p> <p>A day after US senators flew to Taipei to announced a donation of 750,000 vaccines, Chen seems to be speaking very optimistically about Taiwan’s vaccination drive, which has so far reached about 3% of the population. The island has received just a few million doses, and has orders for tens of millions more, but that is reliant on the production of domestic vaccines still in trial stage and the clearance of global shortages.

After more than a year of restrictions, the CEOs of American Airlines, IAG unit British Airways, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and JetBlue Airways Corp said high vaccination rates in both countries meant travel could restart safely. The push for reopening trans-Atlantic routes on Monday comes ahead of meetings between the US president Joe Biden and the British prime minister Boris Johnson at the G7 meeting of advanced economies later this week in Cornwall, southwest England, this week. The pair must use those meetings to agree to restart travel, British Airways chief executive Sean Doyle said in a statement ahead of an online press conference. “We urgently need them to look to the science and base their judgements on a proper risk analysis, allowing us all to benefit from the protection offered by our successful vaccine rollouts,” Doyle said. Since March 2020, the US has barred nearly all non-US citizens who have been in the UK within the previous 14 days from entering the country. Most US travellers visiting the UK must quarantine for 10 days upon arrival. The need for a reopening is much stronger for Britain-based airlines British Airways and Virgin Atlantic which are not benefiting from a rebounding domestic market like their US peers. Hello! This is Lucy Campbell, covering the blog for the next hour while Mattha takes a well-deserved break. Please feel free to get in touch with me as I work if you have a story or tips to share! Your thoughts are always welcome. Email: lucy.campbell@theguardian.com Twitter: @lucy_campbell_ The Associated Press quotes experts that suggests US prisons, which dramatically reduced their populations to stop the spread of Covid during the pandemic, would be better off staying that way and not housing mere shoplifters. The numbers have begun creeping up again as courts are back in session and the shoplifters are back in the dock. It’s worrying criminal justice reformers who argue that the past year proved there is no need to keep so many people locked up in the US. By the middle of last year, the number of people in jails nationwide was at its lowest point in more than two decades, according to a new report published today by the Vera Institute of Justice, whose researchers collected population numbers from about half of the nation’s 3,300 jails to make national estimates. According to the report, shared with The Marshall Project and The Associated Press, the number of people incarcerated in county jails across the country declined by roughly one-quarter, or 185,000, as counties aggressively worked to release people held on low-level charges, dramatically reduced arrest rates and suspended court operations. But in most places, the decrease didn’t last long: From mid-2020 to March 2021, the number of people in jails awaiting trial or serving short sentences for minor offenses climbed back up again by more than 70,000, reaching nearly 650,000. “Reducing the incarcerated population across the country is possible,” said Jacob Kang-Brown, a senior research associate at the Vera Institute of Justice and author of the new report. “We saw decreases in big cities, small cities, rural counties and the suburbs, but the increase we see is troubling.” Norway will shorten the interval between Covid-19 vaccine doses to nine weeks from the current 12 weeks, thus speeding up the inoculation process, the health ministry has said. “We’ll have ample supply of vaccines in the time ahead,” health minister Bent Hoeie said. Norway uses vaccines made by Moderna as well as the Pfizer/BioNTech partnership, each requiring two injections. “Reducing the dose interval is part of the Institute of Public Health’s strategy to ensure that the population is fully vaccinated as quickly as possible,” the ministry said. As of today the country had fully or partly vaccinated 41.8% of all adults, according to the Institute of Public Health. In total, 27.6% of those aged 18 or older have received two doses, while an additional 14.2% got a single injection. The government is due to decide by mid-June whether to relax more of the social restrictions it has imposed to limit the spread of the coronavirus, potentially allowing bars and restaurants to stay open past midnight. A Kafkaesque situation in Portugal where British holidaymakers rushing back home before the Iberian country is added to the UK’s “amber” travel list due to concerns over rising Covid cases, are reporting issues getting pre-departure tests. The BBC quotes Angela Mantana and Craig Stanley, from Derby, who arrived for an eight-day holiday in the Algarve shortly before the directive was announced. They say it is “almost impossible” for them to return. “To say we are incensed is an understatement,” Stanley told the broadcaster. “We have been unable to get any return flights to avoid self-isolation. We now have to do a further two tests at an additional cost to the three tests we have paid for if we want to come out of isolation after five days, which isn’t satisfactory at all.” Mantana told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: It leaves us that we’ve got to finish the holiday and then go into quarantine when we get back. The implications are we are volunteers at a vaccine centre … so we’ve had to let those people down. Equally I shield an aunty who has severe medical conditions … and I’m not going to be able to do that. From 4am BST tomorrow, Portugal will leave the UK’s “green” list and those returning from the country will be required to self-isolate for 10 days and take two PCR tests. Other holidaymakers are complaining of increased flight prices, while chaotic scenes have also been reported from some Portuguese airports. Alan and Lisa Pechey, from Cambridge, who were in Lisbon, told PA Media they had spent £800 on return flights to avoid the need to quarantine. Speaking from Gatwick airport, 66-year-old Lisa said: “It was really expensive and I think the government was totally unfair to throw that at us on Thursday because it really spoiled our holiday, totally … they should have told us to watch out if we were going to Portugal so everyone would have known.” While most of the world suffered through hundreds of millions of cases and millions of deaths from Covid-19, the 23.5 million people in Taiwan largely lived a normal life, thanks to a well-documented strong and early response that saw it go 250 days without a single local case. It lobbied for inclusion in the World Health Organization’s decision-making body off the back of its undeniable success and expertise under the slogan “Taiwan can help”. But now the tables have turned and the island itself is in need of assistance, after an outbreak that started among airline staff in April spread across the island. The government appears to have been caught short by something it thought would never happen: the poster child for outbreak prevention had apparently failed to fully prepare an outbreak response. Indian prime minister Narendra Modi has said that the Indian federal government would provide Covid-19 vaccines free of charge to all adults from later this month as he faces criticism over his handling of the pandemic. Modi said in a televised address that the federal government would take over the task of vaccination from state governments. “It has been decided that from 21 June, all adults over the age of 18 will be vaccinated free,” he said. “Whether it is the poor, the lower middle class, the middle class, or the upper middle class, under the federal government programme, every one will get free vaccines.” The announcement on national television came after weeks of criticism of a bungled vaccine rollout that has covered less than than 5% of India’s estimated adult population of 950 million. Reuters reports that under the earlier policy, the federal government gave free vaccines to the elderly and frontline workers, and left state governments and private hospitals to administer doses for a fee to people in the 18-45 age group. In April, the federal government unexpectedly made provinces responsible for inoculating adults – leaving them facing huge expenses. Modi’s government’s ratings have fallen from 75% in 2019 to 51% this year, according to a survey released last week in one of the first hints that Modi’s popularity with voters may be on the decline, Bloomberg reports. His speech today came after he last addressed the nation on 20 April, when he urged states to avoid lockdowns despite the country heading towards record daily infections of more than 414,000 which subsequently placed serious strain on health infrastructure as pictures of open air mass cremations made international headlines. In a sign of how the government will frame the episode, India’s housing minister Hardeep Singh Puri tweeted: “PM Modi bails out those states who despite the clamour could not even shoulder 25% of the responsibility in India’s fight against Covid. All 18+ citizens will get free Covid-19 vaccines. Centre will bear the cost. Hopefully they will stop wastage &amp; profiteering.” “This [centralised inoculation policy] eliminates states having to compete with one another for vaccine supplies, leaving them to concentrate on distributing them rapidly to their populations,” Gautam Menon, professor of physics and biology at Ashoka University in Delhi, said. Spain has today opened its borders to vaccinated travellers from all over the world, with tourists from Germany, Ireland and Belgium seen passing through the arrival gates at Malaga airport this morning. At least 20 international flights landed in the morning at the most important tourist gateway in the southern Andalusia region, Reuters reports. “We’re thrilled, delighted. We love Spain, the sun, the food and everything about it,” said Irish holidaymaker Gillian Ford, who arrived from rainy Dublin having had her second vaccination. “You only live once so you need to get out of here and enjoy,” she said before heading off to the beaches of Marbella with her husband Edward. “I haven’t been out of Belgium for a year,” said Rose Huo, a 73-year-old Belgian who came to spend a month with her sister. “Everyone is happy I think. We are still very careful but it’s a start.” Under the new rules, Spain from Monday is allowing visitors in who have been fully vaccinated for at least 14 days. Non-vaccinated Europeans – who could previously enter Spain with a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours can now take a cheaper antigen test within the past 48 hours instead. A senior World Health Organization (WHO) official has said that talks are being held with G20 countries, including China and India, regarding financial and Covid-19 vaccine donations to the Covax dose-sharing facility. Bruce Aylward, senior adviser to the WHO director-general and the agency’s coordinator of the ACT-Accelerator, also told reporters the WHO wanted the US, EU member states, Britain, Canada and Japan to contribute doses. Aylward said that a proposal submitted last Friday by the EU to the World Trade Organization to widen Covid-19 vaccine access did not go far enough and said a waiver of patent rights “would add value”. Resisting calls for a patent waiver, the EU submitted a plan it claims would more effectively broaden supply of Covid-19 vaccines than the intellectual property (IP) rights waiver backed by the US. The EU proposals stressed limits on export restrictions and existing WTO rules allowing countries to grant licences to producers. However, Human Rights Watch said the arguments used by the EU to justify its opposition are “inaccurate, misleading, and misguided”. The European Commission claims that intellectual property (IP) is not a barrier to scaling up the manufacturing of vaccines or other health products needed for the Covid-19 response, suggesting that sharing IP would not immediately speed up manufacturing. Right now, there are manufacturers with capacity to produce additional Covid-19 vaccines and other health products at factories in Bangladesh, Canada, Denmark, India, and Israel, but they are unable to contribute because they do not yet have the right licenses. So, IP is a barrier to them. The TRIPS waiver proposal sponsors and experts at the leading science journal Nature, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) Access Campaign, the Third World Network, and others have presented many other concrete examples of how enforcement of IP rules blocked, delayed, or limited production of chemical reagents for Covid-19 tests, ventilator valves, Covid-19 treatments, and elements of Covid-19 vaccines. IP constraints have not only led to vaccine shortages but have also led to shortages of key raw materials like bioreactor bags and filters. Safety concerns about Johnson &amp; Johnson’s Covid vaccine along with overall flagging demand for vaccinations have slowed its US rollout to a crawl, leaving close to half of the 21 million doses produced for the country sitting unused. Reuters reports: Americans have largely eschewed it over the six weeks it has been back in use after a pause to investigate links to cases of a very rare, potentially life-threatening condition called thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), which involves blood clots and low platelet counts, according to data from the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and interviews with health officials and pharmacists in eight states across the country. “We went from having a waiting list to give somebody a shot to having maybe one shot a day or four shots a day,” Michelle Vargas, owner of independent Lamar Family Pharmacy in Lamar, South Carolina, said of plunging demand for the J&amp;J shot in the small rural community. “They’re concerned for their safety. I think that’s the biggest hurdle right now.” In the week ending 25 May, fewer than 650,000 Americans received the J&amp;J shot, accounting for about 5% of total vaccinations administered and down from nearly 3 million in the week leading up to the pause, CDC data shows. Demand for all the vaccines has slowed since mid-April, but the drop has been significantly steeper for the J&amp;J shot. The slowdown may mean some J&amp;J doses will expire unused at a time when global demand for any Covid-19 vaccine is high. J&amp;J doses will be among the 25 million donated by the US announced by the White House last week. The CDC and Food and Drug Administration paused use of the J&amp;J vaccine for nearly two weeks in mid-April. Regulators decided that the vaccine’s benefits outweigh the risk. The condition has also been linked to AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine. A small number of malls and residential complexes in Shanghai have been asking visitors to show proof of Covid-19 vaccination, with one shopping centre’s temporary decision to bar entry sparking a backlash on social media. Reuters has the story: A video showing a local resident arguing with security guards about the legitimacy of barring unvaccinated people at the entrance of the Pacific Life Plaza in Shanghai has been shared tens of hundreds of times on China’s Twitter-like Weibo. Several vendors told Reuters that the mall was blocking unvaccinated customers at the entrance, though people could still sneak in from the exit. The mall operator could not be immediately reached for comment. “This is too much, as this is like compulsory vaccination in disguise,” a popular microblog declared. Inoculation is voluntary in China, with officials explicitly told not to enforce compulsory jabs. Shanghai last reported a community infection on 4 February. “Isn’t vaccination voluntary, on a recommendation basis, and something that is only encouraged? Where did the plaza get the right to bar people from entry?” one said on Weibo. However, a Reuters reporter visited the mall Pacific Life Plaza late today and saw the mall is no longer barring people based on their vaccination status. Vendors at another shopping centre in Shanghai said the Sheshan Baolehui mall is asking visitors to show vaccination credentials, but not blocking unvaccinated people. Ibiza is to hold a 2,000-capacity pilot outdoor clubbing event in the upcoming weeks as the famous party hub seeks a return to nightlife. DJ Mag reports that the venue would be at 50% of its capacity, with just 500 people wearing masks allowed on the dance floor simultaneously. The Balearic government and the Ibiza Leisure Association have agreed to test an outdoor party at a to-be-confirmed location, either at the end of this month or the beginning of July. José Luis Benítez, Ibiza Leisure Association’s manager, told Tourinnews that the event could be a catalyst for a return to nightlife on the island if successful. “Nightlife will return to Ibiza,” he said. “We’ll have it very soon, but it will be different.” Those who have been vaccinated, have had Covid-19 or habe a negative PCR test taken in the last 72 hours will be allowed to attend. Drinks within indoor sections are reportedly set to be restricted to designated seating areas. Ibiza and neighbouring Formentera had 77 active cases of Covid-19, in last week of May, DJ Mag reports. There were no reported Covid deaths in more than six weeks. Slovakia has today become the EU’s second country to start inoculating people with the Russian-made Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine, after months of rows over the shot that has yet to be approved by European regulators. Then-prime minister Igor Matovic bought Sputnik V in March, saying it would speed up vaccination efforts. The country of 5.5 million bought 200,000 doses and intended to buy 2 million. The launch of vaccinations was delayed, however, amid a political crisis that erupted because Matovic had done the deal without consulting his coalition partners, who opposed using the vaccine before it had EU approval, Reuters reports. A reconstructed cabinet finally gave the go-ahead last month to give Sputnik V to those who specifically chose it. Slovak media reported that more than 5,000 people across the country have so far registered to receive Sputnik V. A total of 77,000 people were waiting for a first dose of all vaccines, according to data from one news website. In neighbouring Hungary 1 million people have received 2 doses of Sputnik V, a quarter of the total number to be fully vaccinated in the fellow EU member state. Slovakia has so far given more than 1.8 million first doses and more than 950,000 second doses of Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines. Last week, Russian president Vladimir Putin claimed that Europe has been slow to approve Russia’s Covid vaccine because of a “battle for money” and that commercial interests were being put ahead of the welfare of European citizens. India’s capital New Delhi and financial hub Mumbai today begun a gradual easing of restrictions as coronavirus infections in the country fell to a two-month low. AFP has the full story: Hospitals in the megacities – which have a combined population of some 40 million – were overwhelmed by a deadly Covid-19 wave in April and May, with severe shortages of oxygen and other critical medicines. The huge spike saw India report record-breaking numbers of cases and deaths to become the second worst-hit nation after the US with just under 29 million total infections. Authorities in Delhi and Mumbai, as well as other cities and states, imposed restrictions on movement and activities to combat the surge. “We have to stay safe from corona infection and also bring the economy back on track,” Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted Monday as some shops and malls reopened. Delhi Metro services were allowed to operate at 50% capacity. The northern city was reporting an average of 25,000 daily cases during its peak. It fell to 381 infections yesterday, officials said. Maharashtra, India’s richest state of which Mumbai is the capital, eased restrictions based on infection rates and hospital bed occupancy. In Mumbai, where the caseload soared to 11,163 in early April, there were just 794 new infections yesterday. Malls were allowed to reopen in the city with restrictions, but were reopened fully in cities with lower infection rates such as Nagpur and Aurangabad. India today reported just over 100,000 fresh infections – after several days of 400,000-plus cases in May – and nearly 2,500 deaths. Fiji has transformed its largest hospital into an emergency Covid-only facility, as the country reported a record number of new cases and a surge in the quick-spreading Delta variant, first identified in India. AFP has the story: The South Pacific island nation went a full year without recording any new community cases until April, when it was hit by a second wave of infections. Since then, numbers have steadily increased, with 83 new cases announced last night, bringing the total to 489 active infections. The surge has posed a challenge to Fiji’s under-developed health care system. Permanent secretary for health James Fong said 11 of the new cases were from unknown sources, raising the prospect of widespread community transmission in the nation of almost 930,000. “We expect more days of high numbers of confirmed cases. We sadly expect more hospitalisations as more severe cases of the disease develop,” Fong said. According to Fong, a major infection cluster was centred on Suva’s Colonial War Memorial Hospital, so it was being cordoned off and will treat only Covid-19 patients. Fiji, population 900,000, has so far administered 206,658 first doses and 4,599 second doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine nationwide. Women whose children died at UK festivals after taking drugs have urged the country’s government to support “life-saving” substance-checking services after an influential parliamentary committee warned it was concerned there would be a surge in youth drug deaths this summer without action, partly due to potentially increased risk taking after lockdown. A leading Taiwanese chip testing and packaging company has said that all its migrant employees have been suspended from working for about two weeks to contain a coronavirus outbreak. AFP has the story: At least 206 employees, mostly migrant workers, at facilities run by King Yuan Electronics Company (KYEC) in northern Miaoli county have tested positive, according to the government. The cluster is the first major outbreak in Taiwan’s semiconductor industry, which is operating at full capacity to meet a worldwide shortage of chips that power essential electronic devices. KYEC employs more than 7,000 people, including around 2,100 migrants, and counts some top international tech firms as clients, such as Intel, Qualcomm and Nvidia. KYEC said in a filing to the Taiwan stock exchange that its June output and revenue are expected to drop 30-35% due to the suspension of work. Local media raised concerns that the suspension could impact the global chip shortage as KYEC’s business is a key final step in the semiconductor supply chain. Two other tech firms in Miaoli have also reported infection clusters and suspended migrant workers. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has highlighted guidance for doctors which calls for them to avoid heparin when treating rare blood clots and low platelet counts in patients who received AstraZeneca’s or Johnson &amp; Johnson’s Covid-19 vaccines. Reuters reports that Europe’s drugs regulator, in a statement seeking to boost awareness of proper treatment, focused on guidance from the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH), which has concluded “management should be initiated with non-heparin anticoagulation upon suspicion” of vaccine-linked clotting. “For the management of suspected (thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome), especially if no local guideline is available, the taskforce recommends that healthcare professionals consider the ISTH interim guidance,” the EMA said in its statement. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening to everyone reading. It’s Mattha Busby here taking over the global coronavirus news blog from my colleague Martin Belam. I’ll be seeing you through the next few hours. Please do drop me a line on Twitter or via email (mattha.busby.freelance@guardian.co.uk) with any tips or thoughts – thanks! Police in Ireland have arrested dozens of people during clashes over three consecutive nights with rowdy crowds, raising doubts about government plans for an “outdoor summer” to curb Covid-19. Gardaí arrested 14 people in central Dublin and eight in Cork on Sunday night, bringing to more than 50 the number of people detained over the bank holiday weekend. Each evening throngs peacefully socialised outdoors, enjoying balmy weather, then clusters of young people ended up in violent confrontations with police, throwing bottles and other missiles. “Gardaí encountered significant numbers of groups of youths (teenage and younger adults) who were loitering around the city centre, not involved in outdoor dining/socialising,” said a police statement. The government has encouraged people to socialise outdoors to reduce Covid-19 transmission but large gatherings in city-centre streets, with few masks and little sign of social distancing, have dismayed health officials. City-centre businesses have complained about litter, public urinating and an intimidating atmosphere. Dublin authorities have promised to install 150 portaloo toilets and extra bins. On Monday, bars, restaurants and cafes can resume outdoor service, prompting hope this will reduce street gatherings. It is part of a wider relaxation that is allowing gyms, swimming pools and cinemas to reopen. Former British prime minister Gordon Brown has urged the G7 to act this week to make a plan to “vaccinate the world”, criticising current efforts. He told the media: “We’re not safe until everybody’s safe. It’s an act of self-interest. It’s not just an act of charity. You’ve got to have a plan to underwrite the funding, then you’ve got to get the manufacturing capacity ramped up, then you’ve got to get it in a number of different continents, and then you can vaccinate the world. It needs a plan, not just a wing and a prayer.” Spain is reopening its borders to vaccinated international travellers today, hoping to revive its tourism sector which – like everywhere in the world – has struggled severely during the pandemic. It will also allow cruise ships into its ports from today. Malta has registered no new Covid -19 cases for the first time in 11 months, but the Mediterranean island’s health minister urged people to remain careful to prevent any resurgence. Taiwan has extended its level 3 restrictions until the end of the month, as it continues to report hundreds of daily new cases, including outbreaks in aged care and among migrant worker dormitories. Police in Malaysia are using drones to detect people with high temperatures in public spaces as part of Covid prevention measures, according to local media. The Philippines will open up its vaccination drive this week to include around 35 million people working outside their homes, such as public transport staff, in a bid to help curb Covid-19 transmission and to open up the economy, officials said. India reported 114,460 new coronavirus infections on Sunday, the lowest in two months, while the death toll increased by 2,677, as parts of the country prepared to ease restrictions on movement. New Delhi and other cities are working towards allowing more businesses to operate and movement rules to be relaxed from Monday. The western state of Maharashtra, which is India’s richest and has suffered the most infections during the second wave, plans to start easing in stages a strict lockdown imposed in April. The urban population in India is getting Covid-19 shots much faster than the hundreds of millions of people living in the countryside, government data shows, reflecting rising inequity in the nation’s immunisation drive. Russia’s single-dose Sputnik Light vaccine against Covid-19 has been approved for use in the Republic of the Congo. Uganda’s president Yoweri Museveni further toughened virus curbs on Sunday night, including ordering the closure of schools, to stem a worrying rise in local transmissions. Residents of the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou will not be able to leave unless they can show that it is absolutely necessary to do so, following an outbreak of Covid-19 that has sickened dozens of people in recent days. Senegal could begin producing Covid-19 vaccines next year under an agreement with Belgian biotech group Univercells aimed at boosting Africa’s drug-manufacturing ambitions. Malta has registered no new Covid-19 cases for the first time in 11 months, but the Mediterranean island’s health minister urged people to remain careful to prevent any resurgence. “Today is the first day with zero cases since last summer,” minister Chris Fearne wrote on Twitter. “It is essential that we maintain discipline and responsibility.” Reuters report that the news came as Malta allowed bars, cinemas and theatres to reopen as part of a government timetable to progressively roll back restrictions that was announced months ago. Malta last registered zero cases on 25 July, but cases then gradually rose, to a peak at 510 in March before dropping again. They have been in single figures for weeks. The island leads the European Union in the vaccination programme, with more than half the adult population now fully vaccinated and 75% having had at least a first dose. The Times of Malta reports that as of Sunday, the country had 74 active virus cases. The official confirmation of the figures from the ministry will come at lunchtime. This is the latest from Associated Press on the situation in Guangzhou. Residents of the southern Chinese city will not be able to leave unless they can show that it is absolutely necessary to do so, following an outbreak of Covid-19 that has sickened dozens of people in recent days. Anyone who is given permission to leave must show a negative test for the virus taken in the previous 48 hours, according to rules issued by the city government that take effect Monday. The same rule applies to anyone seeking to leave the surrounding province of Guangdong. The city also is restricting indoor dining, conducting mass testing and banning residents in high-risk neighborhoods from leaving their homes. At least two districts in the city of 18 million people have been closed off entirely. Guangzhou has reported no deaths from the outbreak, but the city reported another four locally transmitted cases in the 24 hours before Monday morning, bringing its recent total to more than 100 since 21 May. While speaking of Russia, Reuters report that the single-dose Sputnik Light vaccine against Covid-19 has been approved for use in the Republic of the Congo. Russia’s daily Covid numbers are at the higher end of their usual level today. Reuters say that official figures there report there have been 9,429 new coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours, alongside a further 330 deaths. Russia’s figures have tended to be between 7,000 and 9,500 new cases every day for months now. Andrew Sparrow is back in the UK live blog hot seat today, and he’s just launched it, leading on the row over international aid cuts. He’ll be carrying Covid news there as well. I’ll be continuing here with the leading coronavirus news from around the world. Uganda’s president Yoweri Museveni further toughened virus curbs on Sunday night, including ordering the closure of schools, to stem a worrying rise in local transmissions. Schools will be closed from Monday for six weeks and most gatherings, save for weddings and funerals in small groups, were banned. Non-essential travel between districts was suspended and a 9pm to 4am curfew will remain in force until mid-July. Most shops and markets remain open, provided they comply with government health regulations, but bars remain closed. Uganda had kept its Covid-19 cases relatively low and was spared the worst of the pandemic after adopting one of Africa’s tightest lockdowns, but it eased the measures as cases dropped. However, infections have soared in recent weeks with a sharp increase in severe cases. Hospitals have been overwhelmed as all intensive care and high dependency beds are occupied, threatening to collapse the fragile healthcare system. “In this wave, the intensity of severe and critically ill Covid-19 patients, and deaths is higher than what we experienced in the first wave of the pandemic,” Museveni said in a televised address. AFP reports that Museveni explained that the east African country had recorded as many severe and critical cases of Covid-19 in a fortnight as it did in a three to four month period during the first wave. “We are concerned that this will exhaust available bed space and oxygen supply in hospitals, unless we constitute urgent public health measures,” said Museveni. The country has counted 52,935 cases of coronavirus, of which 383 have been fatal, figures believed to be undercounted as a result of low testing. The Philippines will open up its vaccination drive this week to include around 35 million people working outside their homes, such as public transport staff, in a bid to help curb Covid-19 transmission and to open up the economy, officials said. The next phase in the rollout that started in March comes after vaccines were initially targeted at health care workers, senior citizens and people with existing health conditions. Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said those eligible to join the new phase, which includes workers in the informal sector, will be able to register from Wednesday, with the country expecting more vaccines to arrive in the second half. Neil Jerome Morales reports for Reuters that the Philippines has so far received more than nine million doses, mostly supplied by China’s Sinovac Biotech, but has a long way to go to meet its goal of immunising 70 million people this year out of a population of 110 million. In order to help shore up confidence in the vaccine programme and tackle vaccine hesitancy, local celebrities were among 50 people vaccinated in an inoculation ceremony on Monday. The Philippines, which is battling one of the worst Covid-19 outbreaks in Asia, has reported 1.27 million infections and almost 22,000 deaths, with some provinces outside the capital region emerging as new hotspots for Covid-19. Taiwan has extended its level 3 restrictions until the end of the month, as it continues to report hundreds of daily new cases, including outbreaks in aged care and among migrant worker dormitories. The central epidemic command centre (CECC) has just announced 211 new cases - a drop on previous days but with a warning that testing numbers may have been lower over the weekend. An additional 26 deaths were reported. In good news, there were no new cases announced from backlogged test results, an issue that has plagued health authorities trying to analyse trends in recent weeks. Most of the new cases were in New Taipei City, with 82 recorded, plus 60 in the capital Taipei and 45 in Miaoli, where outbreaks among factory workers are causing concern, and prompting criticism of the government for failing to protect migrant worker communities – known to be a vulnerable cohort of people, after mass outbreaks in dormitories overseas during the past year. Health minister Chen Shi-chung announced new measures for when a migrant worker is found to be positive, including quarantining all close contacts. He said the labour ministry had begun inspecting the more than 1,000 dorms with more than 50 people, and was in contact with workers in need of support. He urged workers to take advantage of multilingual information apps. There are 64 aged care facilities with recorded cases, including 48 employees and more than 146 others, including residents. Chen said Moderna vaccines will start being distributed in Wednesday, prioritising vulnerable groups for a set period of time before widening the eligibility, as opposed to waiting until everyone in that group is vaccinated. A day after US senators flew to Taipei to announced a donation of 750,000 vaccines, Chen seems to be speaking very optimistically about Taiwan’s vaccination drive, which has so far reached about 3% of the population. The island has received just a few million doses, and has orders for tens of millions more, but that is reliant on the production of domestic vaccines still in trial stage and the clearance of global shortages. At the press conference he has even suggested that people may even be allowed to choose which vaccine they want if there’s enough supply in the future, according to local reporters. Senegal could begin producing Covid-19 vaccines next year under an agreement with Belgian biotech group Univercells aimed at boosting Africa’s drug-manufacturing ambitions, a source involved in funding the project told Reuters. African nations are still struggling to acquire shots. On a continent of 1.3 billion, only about 7 million people have been fully vaccinated. Univercells chief investment officer Kate Antrobus, when asked about the timeframe for the project, confirmed that it could send vaccine doses to Senegal early next year. She declined to comment on the exact date for a full vaccine production line in Senegal but of the timelines referenced she said: “I do not think they are unreasonable.” It is not clear yet what vaccine will be supplied to Senegal, but Antrobus said the site in Belgium would be able to manufacture a class of so-called viral vector Covid-19 vaccine such as those developed by Johnson &amp; Johnson, AstraZeneca, Russia’s Sputnik V and China’s Cansino. “If Covid amazingly subsides over the next year … that same capacity could be used for other viruses,” Antrobus said. Univercells also has its own Covid-19 vaccine candidate, being developed with Germany’s Leukocare and Italian firm ReiThera, which has completed phase 2 trials. It is seeking financing to carry out phase 3, which the Italian government said it is ready to fund. Talking of Sky News, former British prime minister Gordon Brown has been on this morning, urging G7 countries to come together and provide a vaccine supply for poorer nations over and above the “scratching the surface” he said was being done right now We’re not safe until everybody’s safe. It’s an act of self-interest. It’s not just an act of charity, because if the disease spreads and mutates and comes back into our country, then we all suffer, so this is something that the world has got to do together. And that’s why on Friday, when Boris Johnson meets the G7 in Cornwall, with the richest countries sitting around the table, they’ve got the chance to make a decision that will vaccinate the whole world by putting up the money that is necessary to pay for it and sharing the doses. Challenged that there were already commitments to share 100m vaccine doses from the UK, Brown retorted: That’s not a plan. You’ve got to have a plan to underwrite the funding, then you’ve got to get the manufacturing capacity ramped up, then you’ve got to get it in a number of different continents, and then you can vaccinate the world. It needs a plan, not just a wing and a prayer. If you are in the UK then there’s a familiar face back on your screens this morning – Sky News presenter Kay Burley has returned to work after being suspended for six months for breaking Covid-19 rules. Alex Green, PA Media’s entertainment reporter, reminds us that Burley was suspended from the channel in December after making “a big mistake” and “pulling” her colleagues into breaking coronavirus restrictions while celebrating her 60th birthday at a restaurant in London, which was then under tier 2 restrictions. Following an internal review in December, Sky News found that “a small number of Sky News staff attended a social event in London” where Covid-19 guidelines were breached. It said: “All those involved regret the incident and have apologised. Everyone at Sky News is expected to comply with the rules and the company takes breaches like this very seriously indeed.” The channel’s political editor, Beth Rigby, and correspondent Inzamam Rashid were also both taken off air for three months following the review. The Washington Post is leading at the moment with an overnight story that “the last mile” of the vaccination programme in the US is proving to be the hardest. They report: Plummeting vaccination rates have turned what officials hoped would be the “last mile” of the coronavirus immunization campaign into a marathon, threatening President Biden’s goal of getting shots to at least 70 percent of adults by July 4. The United States is averaging fewer than 1 million shots per day, a decline of more than two-thirds from the peak of 3.4 million in April, according to The Washington Post’s seven-day analysis, even though all adults and children over age 12 are now eligible. Small armies of health workers and volunteers often outnumber the people showing up to get shots at clinics around the country. The slowdown is national – with every state down at least two-thirds from its peak – and particularly felt across the South and Midwest. Twelve states, including Utah, Oklahoma, Montana, the Dakotas and West Virginia, have seen vaccinations fall below 15 daily shots per 10,000 residents; Alabama had just four people per 10,000 residents get vaccinated last week. Read more here: Washington Post – Vaccination rates fall off, imperiling Biden’s July Fourth goal The urban Indian population are getting Covid-19 shots much faster than the hundreds of millions of people living in the countryside, government data shows, reflecting rising inequity in the nation’s immunisation drive. In 114 of India’s least developed districts – collectively home to about 176 million people – authorities have administered just 23 million doses in total. That’s the same number of doses as have been administered across nine major cities – New Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Pune, Thane and Nagpur – which combined have half the population of the least developed districts. Reuters notes that the disparity was even stronger last month, after the government allowed private sales of vaccines for adults aged under 45 years, an offer which favoured residents of cities with larger private hospital networks. For the first four weeks of May, those nine cities gave 16% more doses than the combined rural districts, data from the government’s Co-WIN vaccination portal shows. “My friends from the city were vaccinated at private hospitals,” said Atul Pawar, a 38-year-old farmer from Satara, a rural western district of Maharashtra, India’s wealthiest state. “I am ready to pay, but doses are not available and district borders are sealed because of the lockdown.” The ministry of health and family welfare said in a statement at the weekend that reports of vaccine inequity in India were “inaccurate and speculative in nature”. “Liberalised pricing and accelerated national Covid-19 vaccination strategy ensures vaccine equity,” it said, adding that smaller cities were also getting doses like the big ones. India has administered more than 222m doses since starting its campaign in mid-January – only China and the US have administered more – but it has given the required two doses to less than 5% of its 950 million adults. Rural India is home to more than two-thirds of the country’s 1.35 billion people. While urban areas account for a disproportionately large share of the confirmed Covid-19 cases, those concerned about the spread of the virus in the countryside say statistics undercount cases in villages, where testing is less comprehensive. Police in Malaysia are using drones to detect people with high temperatures in public spaces as part of Covid prevention measures, according to local media. The drones, which can detect people’s temperatures as high as 20 metres above ground, emit a red light to alert the authorities if someone has a high reading, Bernama, Malaysia’s state news agency, reported. Malaysia entered a near total national lockdown last week in an attempt to halt rising daily infections, which had reached more than 9,000 by the end of May. Though daily cases have since fallen, the health director general, Noor Hisham Abdullah, has warned that the majority of new infections and deaths were from unknown contacts. “One of the reasons is the emergence of new variants in the community which have higher infectivity and mortality rates,” he said in a statement on Monday, urging people to stay home. Malaysian police have previously warned they will use drones to enforce earlier travel restrictions, with officers in some areas also stating they would carry out surprise home visits to ensure people were following rules. Read more of Rebecca Ratcliffe’s report here: Police in Malaysia use drones to detect high temperatures amid Covid surge Thailand kicked off a long-awaited mass vaccination campaign on Monday as the country battles its third and worst wave of the coronavirus epidemic. Reuters report that officials recorded 2,419 new Covid-19 cases and 33 deaths on Monday, bringing the total to 179,886 and 1,269 fatalities. The third wave has accounted for more than 80% of total infections so far. The government aims to administer 6 million doses of locally-made AstraZeneca and imported Sinovac vaccines this month, hoping to assuage worries about the slow roll-out and supply shortages. “The government will ensure that everyone is vaccinated,” prime minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said in televised comments after he visited an inoculation centre in Bangkok. The government plans to vaccinate 70% of Thailand’s population of more than 66 million people by the end of the year. So far, 2.8 million people deemed most vulnerable, including frontline health and transport workers, have received a first dose. But the government has come under fire from opposition politicians who accuse it of complacency and an over-reliance on the locally-made AstraZeneca doses. Good morning, it is Martin Belam here taking over the live blog in London. A US public health expert has warned that though cases of Covid-19 are at their lowest rates for months and much of the country is returning to normal life, young Americans are still “a vulnerable host” for the coronavirus. Dr Richina Bicette, associate medical director at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, told CNN children were now accounting for nearly 25% of US cases. “As adults get vaccinated and become more protected and immune,” she said, “the virus is still in the community looking for a vulnerable host and pediatric patients fit that description.” Children aged 12 and above are eligible to receive the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, one of three in US use. Federal authorities will this week debate extending vaccines to children aged 11 and under. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data shows that 52% of the US population over the age of 12 has had at least one vaccine dose and 42% is fully protected. The Biden administration wants 70% of US adults to have received at least one shot by 4 July. Deaths in the US have slowed drastically, the toll a little under 590,000. But with virus variants causing problems as other countries reopen, experts have voiced concern over slowing rates of vaccination, particularly in Republican states. Reuters: India reported 114,460 new coronavirus infections on Sunday, the lowest in two months, while the death toll increased by 2,677, as parts of the country prepared to ease restrictions on movement. New Delhi and other cities are working towards allowing more businesses to operate and movement rules to be relaxed from Monday. The western state of Maharashtra, which is India’s richest and has suffered the most infections during the second wave, plans to start easing in stages a strict lockdown imposed in April. Taiwan authorities have extended level three restrictions until the end of June. The restrictions, which have closed schools, all entertainment, public and sporting venues, and limited personal gatherings, were due to expire next week but authorities have pre-emptively extended them. After living largely Covid-free, Taiwan is experiencing its worst outbreak of the pandemic, with about 11,000 total cases and more than 260 deaths – more than 90% of them since mid-April. In a statement, Taiwan’s cabinet said the outbreak “has not yet stabilised”, and they would release more details of the extension later today. First announced on 19 May, the restrictions appear to have prevented an explosion in case numbers but have not led to a decline. Daily new cases remain in the hundreds, amid concerns over the continued lack of widespread working from home, and worsening outbreaks among employees at three factories, predominately among migrant workers who mostly live in crowded dormitories. Spain is reopening its borders to vaccinated international travellers today, hoping to revive its tourism sector which – like everywhere in the world – has struggled severely during the pandemic. It will also allow cruise ships into its ports from today. The country’s health minister, Carolina Daria, said Spain was “in the process of reclaiming its global leadership in tourism”. “Spain is a safe destination,” she said. Previously Spain allowed European visitors who have a negative PCR test taken within the previous 72 hours, but from today those visitors can take a cheaper antigen test. The three biggest tourist contingents to Spain after from the UK, France and Germany, but in a potential blow to the reopening the British government has not yet removed Spain from its list of at-risk countries, meaning any holidayers will have to quarantine when they get home. According to AFP, Spain’s Malaga airport is expecting about 20 different flights on Monday morning alone, from places around Europe such as Berlin, Lille, Frankfurt and London. Hello and welcome to today’s rolling coverage of the pandemic. Here’s a quick look at developments from the last day. China has enacted mass testing and travel restrictions in Shenzhen over new cases there, while nearby Guangzhou continues to battle the country’s first outbreak of the Delta variant, first detected in India. Taiwan has extended its level 3 restrictions until the end of June, as it continues to report hundreds of new daily cases. The US has announced 750,000 vaccines will be donated to Taiwan. The UK recorded 5,341 cases on Sunday, an increase of 2,101 on last Sunday when 3,111 cases were reported. Portugal’s prime minister has criticised Britain for removing the country from the green list, allowing travellers to visit Portugal without quarantine on return. UK ministers are ‘absolutely open’ to delaying the 21 June reopening date in England if the Delta variant worsens, the health secretary said. Sunday is the first day for 12-16-year-olds in Israel to get vaccinated, after 55% of the population have so far received two doses in the country. Morocco will reopen its airports to international traffic starting from 15 June to help the return of its nationals living abroad Staff of a senate committee investigating the handling of the pandemic in Brazil have said that the Copa America football tournament should not be held amid the world’s second-deadliest outbreak and must be postponed. Uganda’s president, Yoweri Museveni, re-imposed a strict lockdown that included the closure of schools and the suspension of inter-district travel. Victorians in Australia are being warned there is no ‘magic number’ of the people getting vaccinated before future lockdowns can be avoided.","charCount":"51842","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/lucy-campbell\">Lucy Campbell</a> (now), <a href=\"profile/mattha-busby\">Mattha Busby</a>, <a href=\"profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a> and<a href=\"profile/helen-davidson\">Helen Davidson</a> (earlier)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/live/2021/jun/07/biden-uk-trip-g7-cornwall-european-leaders-queen-putin-latest-us-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-07T14:27:36Z","webTitle":"Joe Biden gears up for trip to Europe to meet Queen and Putin – live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2021/jun/07/biden-uk-trip-g7-cornwall-european-leaders-queen-putin-latest-us-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/live/2021/jun/07/biden-uk-trip-g7-cornwall-european-leaders-queen-putin-latest-us-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Joe Biden gears up for trip to Europe to meet Queen and Putin – live","standfirst":"<ul><li>President to meet world leaders at G7 in Cornwall this week</li><li>Biden expected to affirm US’s special relationship with UK</li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jun/07/climate-crisis-to-shrink-g7-economies-twice-as-much-as-covid-19-says-research\">Climate crisis ‘to shrink G7’s economies twice as much as Covid’</a></li></ul>","trailText":"President to meet world leaders at G7 in Cornwall this week and have summit with Putin in Geneva – follow all the latest news","byline":"Vivian Ho","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"754a201b269cb688c5422883eabd93e8f1f5a247\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/754a201b269cb688c5422883eabd93e8f1f5a247/0_194_3842_2307/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Biden at the White House on Friday.

She likened them to “propaganda pushers” and “representatives of the Russian and Chinese media asking questions directed by their government.” “The things that get under my skin are when the premise of a question is based on inaccurate information, misleading information,” she said. Psaki also defended the Biden administration against criticism for holding only one presidential press conference: “That may be driven more by the media than it is by the American public,” she said. The Supreme Court has declined to review a lawsuit challenging the country’s male-only draft registration policy as unconstitutional. Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote essentially that Congress should take the lead on the issue on whether all genders should be required to register with the Selective Service System at age 18 and be considered for military service should a draft be called up again. While the Trump administration had defended the policy, Joe Biden’s acting solicitor general Elizabeth B. Prelogar had advised the court not to take up the issue because Congress was considering including women in the draft registration, the Washington Post reports. In case you missed it, Democratic West Virginia senator Joe Manchin took out a column in the Charleston Gazette-Mail on Sunday to say that he would be opposing the For the People Act. “I believe that partisan voting legislation will destroy the already weakening binds of our democracy,” wrote Manchin, who was considered a key vote to counter efforts by Republicans in state government to restrict voting rights. Reaction was swift. Manchin also used the column to reiterate his support of the filibuster, which gives 41 of 100 senators the ability to block action by the majority. Democrats have argued that Republicans have repeated used the filibuster to support minority positions - last month, they used it to block the creation of a bipartisan, 9/11-style investigatory commission on the attack on the US capitol. A study by the Center for American Progres found that Republicans used filibusters roughly twice as much as Democrats to prevent the other party from passing legislation.

The article cited an unnamed prime ministerial aide as saying that in an early call with Biden, Johnson said he did not like the phrase, used by the US president, because to Johnson it seemed “needy and weak”. Johnson’s spokesperson said: “The prime minister is on the record previously saying he prefers not to use the phrase but that in no way detracts from the importance with which we regard our relationship with the US, our closest ally.” Asked if Johnson thus believed journalists should not use the phrase, the spokesperson said: “I don’t think the prime minister would entertain the prospect of trying to tell the media what to say.” In an article for the Washington Post published on Sunday before his first foreign travel trip as president, Biden wrote: “In the United Kingdom, after meeting with Prime Minister Boris Johnson to affirm the special relationship between our nations, I will participate in the G7 summit.” Biden, Johnson and leaders from the other countries in the G7 will gather from Friday in the Cornish resort of Carbis Bay. The US president will see the Queen at Windsor Castle on Sunday. On Thursday, before the G7, he will meet Johnson in London, with the president’s official schedule also listing this event in the context of “the special relationship”. The term is credited to Winston Churchill, who used it in a 1946 lecture tour of US universities, basing the idea on both countries’ ties of culture and language, and their role in the then emerging face-off with the Soviet-led east of Europe. Numerous prime ministers and presidents have continued to use the term, but as the UK’s global status and power has declined over the decades, it has often been seen as one more important to politicians in London, if often happily indulged by friendly counterparts in Washington.","charCount":"2187","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/peterwalker\">Peter Walker</a> Political correspondent"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2021/jun/07/us-and-europe-dismiss-iaea-warning-in-hope-of-reviving-iran-nuclear-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-07T14:11:01Z","webTitle":"US and Europe dismiss IAEA warning in hope of saving Iran nuclear deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/07/us-and-europe-dismiss-iaea-warning-in-hope-of-reviving-iran-nuclear-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/jun/07/us-and-europe-dismiss-iaea-warning-in-hope-of-reviving-iran-nuclear-deal","fields":{"headline":"US and Europe dismiss IAEA warning in hope of reviving Iran nuclear deal","standfirst":"<p>UN officials unsure whether Iran building nuclear weapons but UK, France, Germany and US push for breakthrough in talks</p>","trailText":"Officials unsure whether Iran building nuclear weapons but UK, France, Germany and US push for breakthrough in talks","byline":"Patrick Wintour Diplomatic editor","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"99bbdb1d3014dca8a9cdb8c679a049e5a0d0cff2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/99bbdb1d3014dca8a9cdb8c679a049e5a0d0cff2/1036_1598_2998_1799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rafael Grossi at the IAEA board of governors meeting at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna, Austria.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rafael Grossi at the IAEA board of governors meeting at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna, Austria.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Bruna/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>The US and Europe have decided to set aside a fresh warning from the director general of the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that it is no longer possible to say with confidence whether Iran is seeking to build a bomb, as they press on with attempting to revive its nuclear deal with the west.</p> <p>Rafael Grossi says Iran is not co-operating or providing any answers to questions his agency has posed after it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/26/iran-failure-explain-uranium-traces-big-problem-iaea-un\">found nuclear particles at four undeclared sites</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/01/iran-nuclear-program-un-watchdog-unable-to-access-data-since-february\">Iran nuclear program: UN watchdog unable to access data since February</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Grossi’s findings were reported to a board meeting of the IAEA in Vienna, and are deeply awkward for the US, France, Germany and the UK, which have collectively decided that the prize of a revived nuclear deal is so great they will not act on the complaints of the UN nuclear inspectorate, even if this temporarily risks the integrity of the UN inspection process.</p> <p>The sixth round of nuclear talks is due to start in Vienna on Thursday in the hope that a brief pause to allow delegations to consult national capitals will achieve the required breakthrough; allowing the US to rejoin the nuclear deal; sanctions on Iran to be lifted and Iran itself to come back into full compliance.

Speaking to the IAEA board on Monday, Grossi said: “The lack of progress in clarifying the agency’s questions concerning the correctness and completeness of Iran’s safeguards declarations seriously affects the ability of the IAEA to provide assurance of the peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear programme.” Grossi is especially exasperated since he believed he had reached a new understanding with Iran about his inquiries after a visit to Iran was supposed to inject a new urgency into a process that has been continuing since 2018.

The prospect of stablecoins as a means of payment and the emerging propositions of CBDC have generated a host of issues that central banks, governments, and society as a whole, need to carefully consider and address.</p> <p>It is essential that we ask the difficult and pertinent questions when it comes to the future of these new forms of digital money.”</p> </blockquote> <p>The Bank adds that responses to its recent discussion paper on CBDCs has identified five key issues:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Financial inclusion</strong> should be a prominent consideration in the design of any CBDC. Any CBDC should have a high degree of accessibility to people, regardless of their geographic location in the UK, age, socioeconomic status, digital skills or disability.</li> <li>A <strong>competitive CBDC ecosystem</strong> with a diverse set of participants will support innovation and offer the best chance to deliver the benefits of CBDC. Respondents agreed the Bank should provide the minimum level of infrastructure for the system to be reliable, resilient, fast and efficient. The private sector should take a leading role in responding to the needs of the end users.</li> <li>In assessing the case for CBDC, <strong>the Bank should assess whether non-CBDC payment innovations could deliver the same benefits</strong>. An assessment of the net benefits of CBDC should therefore consider to what extent they can instead be delivered by private sector proposals.</li> <li>A <strong>CBDC should seek to protect users’ privacy</strong>. Feedback from respondents has emphasised the importance that users place on having privacy in their transactions. As with existing forms of digital payments, there are important legal compliance arrangements that CBDC would need to meet, such as anti money laundering, countering the financing of terrorism and sanctions. Subject to meeting these the Bank should therefore seek to ensure that users enjoy a strong level of privacy from any transactions associated with CBDC.</li> <li>While CBDC <strong>should “do no harm” to the Bank’s ability to meet monetary and financial stability</strong>, opportunities to meet our policy objectives more effectively should also be considered in CBDC exploration. The Bank is primarily focused on possible benefits CBDC might bring for ‘payments’. It is also considering the possible opportunities that CBDC may offer for monetary and financial stability.</li> </ol> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60bdec4f8f082e80569f8b99\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-07T10:08:43.324Z\">11.08am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Serviced office group IWG warns on profits</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4e50a47e7935550d6c3ab6e39b74d02db6125e7d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e50a47e7935550d6c3ab6e39b74d02db6125e7d/0_536_2996_1798/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Office space by provider IWG in Spaces Globe Park, Marlow, Britain.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Serviced office provider IWG has already been battered by the pandemic, and the latest Covid-19 variants will mean more pain this year.</strong></p> <p>IWG warned this morning that underlying earnings for this year would be “well below” 2020’s levels, due to the emergence of new, more infections strains such as the Delta variant.<br></p> <p>IWG had been pinning its recovery hopes on the move to flexible working - where people dividing their time between home, and a desk at one of its shared workspaces. </p> <p>But as my colleague <strong>Kalyeena Makortoff</strong> reports, ongoing lockdowns and new variants are hitting IWG’s profits.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The company, formerly known as Regus, reported a<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/mar/09/office-space-iwg-loss-covid-19-hybrid-working\"> £620m annual loss</a> for 2020, when its finances were hit by social distancing rules and work from home orders resulted in empty offices.</p> <p>The UK-listed company, which is headquartered in Switzerland, reported strong recovery in some markets including the US.

The French Competition Authority said Google had unfairly sent business to its own services and discriminated against the competition. The watchdog found that Google’s ad management platform for large publishers - Google Ad Manager - favoured the company’s own online ad marketplace - Google AdX - where publishers sell space to advertisers in real-time. Significantly, Google has agreed to change some of its global advertising practices as well as pay the fine, which could help publishers and other tech companies. CNBC has more details: The investigation found that Google gave preferential treatment to its DFP advertising server, which allows publishers of sites and applications to sell their advertising space, and its SSP AdX listing platform, which organizes auction processes and allows publishers to sell their “impressions” or advertising inventory to advertisers. Google’s rivals and publishers suffered as a result, the regulator said. Isabelle de Silva, president of the French Competition Authority, said in a statement that the decision is the first in the world “to look at the complex algorithmic auction processes by which online advertising ‘display’ operates.” Google says it has agreed on a set of commitments to make it easier for publishers to make use of data, and use its tools with other ad technologies. The FT reckons the French case could provide a blueprint for other ongoing lawsuits against the company, as it “laid out in detail” how Google dominates the world of online advertising: “Google used its vertically integrated business model in display advertising to gain an advantage over other competitors,” said Isabelle de Silva, the president of France’s Competition Authority, at a briefing on Monday. “This is the first investigation in the world that examines the display advertising space where Google is dominant, and the first time Google has agreed to a settlement with engagements. This case will be of interest to other regulators who are looking at the online ad market and technologies.” Shares in the US tech giants are pretty calm in early trading too, shrugging off the G7 tax deal agreed on Saturday. Amazon are down 0.2% (as we report today, it might not even be caught by the new clampdown). Facebook shares are also 0.2% lower, while Apple has dipped by 0.6%. Google owner Alphabet are flat, while Microsoft (whose Irish subsidiary paid no corporation tax on profits of $315bn (£222bn) due to being ‘resident’ in Bermuda) are up 0.4%. Although setting a minimum global corporation tax of at least 15%, as proposed, is progress - ending a long race to the bottom on corporate tax rate - it’s still relatively low (and less ambitious than the original Biden proposal of 21%). And it has yet to be agreed by the G20, so the battle to make global business pay their fair share continues.... Wall Street has opened rather quietly, with the main indices little-changed in at the start of the new trading week: Bloomberg is reporting that De Beers has raised some rough-diamond prices by about 10% this week, after seeing strong demand from buyers. It says the world’s top producer is cashing in on rampant demand from cutters and polishers. Here’s a flavour: The diamond industry roared back to life in the past six months, after stalling at the start of the pandemic last year. Cutting centers in India and Antwerp have been replenishing supplies after they’d been unable to buy during the worst of the crisis. At the same time, demand jumped amid surprisingly good festive sales. That’s created an opportunity for the biggest producers to rapidly escalate prices. De Beers has been increasing since the end of last year and was already back to pre-coronavirus levels. It sold more than $1.6 billion in rough gems in its first three sales of 2021, the most since 2018. The increase at this week’s sale is unusually sharp for De Beers. The miner this week increased the prices for some rough diamonds bigger than 2 carats by about 10%, with other expensive goods rising in high single digits, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified discussing private information. The company also raised the prices of some categories of smaller goods. The luxury market has been notably strong recently. Last month, Cartier owner Richemont reported strong demand for jewellery, with sales exceeding their pre-pandemic levels over the last year. The jump in UK house prices is helping to drive consumer confidence into rosier territory.... ...although not if you’re priced out of buying a property, of course. YouGov’s consumer confidence gauge, released this morning, has jumped to its highest level since April 2016. People are more upbeat about their personal finances, and confident about the future as they look beyond the pandemic. The survey found that: Outlook on job security highest on record at 118.9 Sentiment on house prices continues to improve, with retrospective measure at four-year peak Confidence among households about personal finances at record high, with measure improving by 2.7 in past month and expectations up by 1.5 points Outlook for business activity continues to improve, increasing by 3.8 points Darren Yaxley, Director of Reputation Research at YouGov, said: The growth is yet again driven by confidence in house value as property prices climb to a seven year high, but is also supplemented by huge increases in optimism for job security over the coming twelve months likely due to labour shortages. “With not a single metric decreasing this month, business activity for the past 30 days and outlook for household finances over the next 12 months are the only metrics to show little change. Despite this the metrics are still firmly in the positive showing more Britons are feeling confident than not.” Jeff Bezos is heading where no tech billionaire has gone before, with his brother alongside. The Amazon.com founder, and his brother Mark, will both travel to the edge of space next month on the first human flight operated by his rocket company Blue Origin. In an Instagram post, Bezos wrote that he’s dreamed of travelling to space since he was five: On July 20th, I will take that journey with my brother. The greatest adventure, with my best friend. The Bezos brothers will travel on the New Shepard spacecraft, along with the winner of a multimillion-dollar auction for the final seat - just a couple of weeks after Jeff steps down as Amazon’s chief executive. The flight takes 11 minutes, with the reusable suborbital New Shepard system flying more than 62 miles above Earth beyond the Kármán line (the boundary between Earth’s atmosphere and outer space). That’s high enough to experience a few minutes of weightlessness and see the curvature of the planet before the pressurized capsule returns to earth under parachutes. In the Instagram video clip, Jeff Bezos explains how the flight will be an adventure, and ‘a big deal for me’: To see the earth from space it changes you — it changes your relationship with this planet, with humanity. It’s one Earth. Mark Bezos founded private equity firm HighPost Capital and also works for an anti-poverty charity, and as a volunteer firefighter. He says he didn’t expect his brother to be on the trip - let alone both of them. Lunchtime update: The London stock market is holding its gains, thanks to a strong performance by the housebuilders. The FTSE 100 index is up 20 points, or 0.3%, at 7089 points, with Persimmon (+2.8%), Barratt Development (+2.3%) and Taylor Wimpey (+2%) among the top risers. The smaller FTSE 250 index is has gained 0.35%, with builders Crest Nicholson (+2.8%) and Redrow (+2.7%) among the risers. Construction stocks are a good gauge of UK economic confidence, and Halifax’s prediction that house prices will keep rising will be providing support too. Sophie Griffiths, market analyst at OANDA, says: While miners are trading lower, housebuilders are boosting the index after a stronger-than-expected increase in house prices. The Halifax house price index recorded a 1.3% MoM rise, ahead of the 1.2% forecast. European stock market have shaken off their earlier losses, with the Stoxx 600 now up 0.25%. Campaign group Positive Money have welcomed the Bank of England’s statement that stablecoins should face closer regulation if they become widely used in the UK. Simon Youel, head of policy &amp; advocacy at Positive Money, says users need to be protected from the risks of private money, but would benefit from a BoE-backed digital currency. “With the decline of cash and emergence of private digital currencies, we urgently need a new form of public money in the form of a central bank digital currency, to ensure that we aren’t surrendering the future of money to unaccountable private interests. “A central bank digital currency would open up access to our central bank to everyone, taking away the unique privileges enjoyed by private banks, and ending our reliance on them to manage our money and make payments.” “It is welcome that the Bank of England intends to regulate private digital currencies such as stablecoins to protect users. If stablecoins and cryptoassets are to function as money they should be regulated as such.” Tether, the biggest stablecoin, has a market value of over $60bn, and is pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. In May, it showed that 75% of Tethers were backed by “cash and cash equivalents”, with only 3% backed by actual cash [the FT has a great explanation here] The Bank of England has launched a discussion paper examining the complex, but fascinating, question of central bank digital money and the wider issues surrounding digital currency. And in it, the BoE says that “stablecoins” (digital tokens pegged to a traditional currency, but issued by private firms) should be regulated like payments handled by banks if they start to become widely used. But there’s no decision yet on whether the central bank will launch its own digital currency. In its discussion paper, the BoE says the use of stablecoins as money creates important issues. Any stablecoins that become “systemic” should be stable in value at all times and offer 1-to-1 redemption with a robust legal claim, the Bank says. Stablecoins used as money should meet equivalent standards as those provided by commercial bank money (bank deposits), it continues. Plus, any regulatory model for stablecoins should include ‘a core set of features of the current banking regime’ -- including capital requirements, liquidity requirements and support from a central bank, and a backstop to compensate depositors in the event of failure. The Bank says: New forms of digital money could be preferred by the public to commercial bank deposits, but they will endure only if they can be trusted as a store of value and as an accepted means of payment. This means that stablecoins must promise, credibly and consistently, to be fully interchangeable with existing forms of money. In other words, they must be anchored. This is essential for ensuring that users have the same confidence in stablecoins as commercial bank money. The BBC’s Faisal Islam has tweeted the key points too: The Bank says it hasn’t yet decided whether it will take the plunge and issue its own central bank digital currency, or CBDC (which chancellor Rishi Sunak has nicknamed ‘Britcoin’). But Governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, said the bank is considering it closely. “We live in an increasingly digitalised world where the way we make payments and use money is changing rapidly. The prospect of stablecoins as a means of payment and the emerging propositions of CBDC have generated a host of issues that central banks, governments, and society as a whole, need to carefully consider and address. It is essential that we ask the difficult and pertinent questions when it comes to the future of these new forms of digital money.” The Bank adds that responses to its recent discussion paper on CBDCs has identified five key issues: Financial inclusion should be a prominent consideration in the design of any CBDC. Any CBDC should have a high degree of accessibility to people, regardless of their geographic location in the UK, age, socioeconomic status, digital skills or disability. A competitive CBDC ecosystem with a diverse set of participants will support innovation and offer the best chance to deliver the benefits of CBDC. Respondents agreed the Bank should provide the minimum level of infrastructure for the system to be reliable, resilient, fast and efficient. The private sector should take a leading role in responding to the needs of the end users. In assessing the case for CBDC, the Bank should assess whether non-CBDC payment innovations could deliver the same benefits. An assessment of the net benefits of CBDC should therefore consider to what extent they can instead be delivered by private sector proposals. A CBDC should seek to protect users’ privacy. Feedback from respondents has emphasised the importance that users place on having privacy in their transactions. As with existing forms of digital payments, there are important legal compliance arrangements that CBDC would need to meet, such as anti money laundering, countering the financing of terrorism and sanctions. Subject to meeting these the Bank should therefore seek to ensure that users enjoy a strong level of privacy from any transactions associated with CBDC. While CBDC should “do no harm” to the Bank’s ability to meet monetary and financial stability, opportunities to meet our policy objectives more effectively should also be considered in CBDC exploration. The Bank is primarily focused on possible benefits CBDC might bring for ‘payments’. It is also considering the possible opportunities that CBDC may offer for monetary and financial stability. Serviced office provider IWG has already been battered by the pandemic, and the latest Covid-19 variants will mean more pain this year. IWG warned this morning that underlying earnings for this year would be “well below” 2020’s levels, due to the emergence of new, more infections strains such as the Delta variant. IWG had been pinning its recovery hopes on the move to flexible working - where people dividing their time between home, and a desk at one of its shared workspaces. But as my colleague Kalyeena Makortoff reports, ongoing lockdowns and new variants are hitting IWG’s profits. The company, formerly known as Regus, reported a £620m annual loss for 2020, when its finances were hit by social distancing rules and work from home orders resulted in empty offices. The UK-listed company, which is headquartered in Switzerland, reported strong recovery in some markets including the US. However, occupancy levels across the whole group were lower than expected due to “the prolonged impact of Covid-19, including continuing lockdown restrictions and the emergence of new variants of the virus in some markets”. “Accordingly, this will delay the anticipated recovery in our business and, given the operational gearing of the group, is expected to have a significant impact on the group’s results for 2021,” IWG said, adding that underlying earnings will come in “well below the level in 2020”. Shares in IWG have tumbled almost 13% this morning, to 319p, making it the biggest faller on the FTSE 250 index of medium-size firms. House prices are likely to continue rising for some time despite hitting a new record high in May, one of Britain’s biggest mortgage lenders has said. The monthly snapshot of the property market from Halifax showed a 1.3% jump in the cost of a home in May, taking the average selling price to a record £261,743 as homebuyers raced to complete purchases before the stamp duty holiday begins to run down at the end of this month. Halifax said almost £22,000 had been added to the average house price since May 2020, when the UK experienced the first easing of national lockdown restrictions, and the gradual reopening of the housing market after a temporary freeze. It marks a 9.5% annual increase, the fastest rate of growth in seven years. The report echoes similar findings from a survey by Nationwide last week, which showed prices rising 10.9% year on year, the fastest rate since August 2014. Here’s the full story: The average UK house price has jumped by more than £22,000 over the past 12 months, and by £3,000 in May alone, Halifax’s data shows. That puts the housing ladder further out of reach for many first-time buyers -- undermining the new 95% mortgage guarantee scheme launched this spring. Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, says: ‘Cheap borrowing and affordability is giving buyers more purchase power, which is pushing up prices. Lenders remain keen to lend and have plenty of cash to do so, resulting in ever-lower mortgage rates from sub-1 per cent. However, lenders aren’t only targeting those with big deposits or similar levels of equity in their homes, with options also increasing for first-time buyers at 95 per cent loan-to-value and the first properties being sold under the government’s First Homes initiative. This is just as well given that rising property prices are not good news for first-time buyers, and will make getting on the housing ladder even more of a struggle.’ Here’s Bloomberg’s take on the UK housing boom: U.K. house prices grew at their strongest pace in almost seven years as consumers unleashed pent-up savings to gain more space after coronavirus lockdowns, Halifax Building Society said. Prices grew 1.3% in May, driving the annual pace of growth to 9.5%, the mortgage lender said in a statement on Monday. That put the average cost of a home at £261,743 ($369,895). The report confirmed findings of Nationwide Building Society, which also showed prices growing at the fastest since 2014. The market is benefitting from a temporary tax-break on property purchases, a buildup in savings by consumers and confidence in recovery from the virus. Covid-19 travel restrictions might also keep house prices hot this summer, reckons Lucy Pendleton, property expert at independent estate agents James Pendleton. The housing market usually takes a breather over the summer months, as some potential buyers head off on holiday. But this year, most popular overseas destinations are the UK’s ‘amber’ or ‘red’ lists (meaning arrivals must quarantine), and France is restricting non-essential travel from the UK altogether. So more people will be at home...and perhaps looking to move house instead. Pendleton says: “The inability of Britons to go on holiday means there’s no distraction now from executing that ambitious move to a larger home. We’re entering a time of year when school holidays and foreign trips normally force the market to drop to a slightly slower pace. “That’s not necessarily going to happen this year and sustained, strong demand over the next few months could have ramifications when the market cools in the autumn, delivering on paper what might look like a more rapid slow down. She also argues that the relatively sluggish figures for London (annual growth of 3.1%) don’t tell the full story. House price growth in the capital is not exceptional as a whole, but it is still being powered by the same race for space that is driving the national market. Many buyers just can’t get what they want within budget after a relatively strong decade of gains. Location has become less important and space more so. UK estate agents predict that the housing market might cool slightly after May’s boom, as the stamp duty freeze is being reduced at the end of the month (from £500k to £250k). Guy Gittins, CEO of Chestertons saw “exceptional transaction volume” in May with three times more buyers than usual, and viewings running at a 5-year high for the past three months. As the Stamp Duty Holiday threshold drops to £250,000 from 30 June to 30 September and then returns back to normal levels from 1 October, we predict new buyer registrations to slightly decrease.” George Franks, co-founder of London-based estate agents, Radstock Property, says the government’s ‘meddling’ has pumped up prices. “May was a month of two halves. The first half was extremely busy as there was still a chance to purchase before the June Stamp Duty deadline. The second half of May and first week of June have been quieter, perhaps due to sunny weather, half term or everyone fleeing to Portugal. More likely, though, it is because there is no urgency as people have resigned themselves to missing the Stamp Duty deadline. “Buyers now appear to be waiting to see what happens to the market after the end of June, possibly in the hope that prices will start to fall. This is especially the case in the sub-£800k bracket. It might take a few months to see how things pan out from July onwards. It will not be as simple as reducing asking prices, or indeed offers, by £15,000, as the Stamp Duty holiday was about sentiment as much as money and the fundamentals remain strong. “I don’t believe the property market is in a bubble, but it has certainly benefited from Government meddling in the form of the Stamp Duty holiday and mortgage guarantee scheme. We’ve effectively had two years rolled into one due to Government intervention. Looking forward, the fundamentals have not changed, namely money is cheap, it’s still cheaper to own than to rent and there is a profound lack of stock.” Jeremy Leaf, north London estate agent, says the market is calming down slightly, but still “very busy on the ground”. We notice too from connected chains that activity is even stronger in areas outside London where affordability is greater. ’Those who have little chance of making the stamp duty deadline are already considering ways of negotiating their way to completing transactions. We expect activity to settle but not drastically change in the next few months.’ The UK housing boom is running particularly hot in Wales, and parts of the North of England. Halifax’s data shows that Wales has seen the biggest surge in house prices, with the average property costing 11.9% more than a year ago. Two other regions have recorded double-digit growth: the North West (+10.6%) and Yorkshire &amp; Humber (+10.2%), outpacing the average annual rise of 9.5% (the fastest since 2014). For Wales and the North West, these are the biggest percentage gains since April 2005, Halifax says, and for Yorkshire &amp; Humber its the biggest jump since June 2006. But the South of England, particularly London, are lagging. Halifax MD Russell Galley explains: This likely reflects a weakness in city prices given the shift in preference for properties with more space, whilst recent surcharges on stamp duty for non-UK residents and Brexit concerns will also have weighed on the capital’s market. UK house prices have risen to a new peak, as the stamp duty holiday and the stampede for larger houses following the pandemic continues to fuel the market. Halifax reports that the average property now costs £261,743, with annual house price inflation at its strongest level in almost seven years (on its index). According to Halifax, the average price rose by 1.3% in May alone, and was 9.5% higher than a year ago. Several factors seem to be driving prices sharply higher, Halifax says. One is the government’s extended freeze on stamp duty payments, which is reduced from £500,000 at the end of June, and ends three months later. Plus, the savings build up by more prosperous families during lockdown; rising demand for homes better suited to home-working; and a shortage of properties on the market. Russell Galley, managing director of Halifax, explains: “Heading into the traditionally busy summer period, market activity continues to be boosted by the government’s stamp duty holiday, with prospective buyers racing to complete purchases in time to benefit from the maximum tax break ahead of June’s deadline, after which there will be a phased return to full rates. For some homebuyers, lockdown restrictions have also resulted in an unexpected build-up of savings, which can now be deployed to fund bigger deposits for bigger properties, potentially pushing property prices even higher. Galley also predicts that prices could keep rising: Whilst these effects will be temporary, the current strength in house prices also points to a deeper and long-lasting change as buyer preferences shift in anticipation of new, post-pandemic lifestyles – as greater demand for larger properties with more space might warrant an increased willingness to spend a higher proportion of income on housing. These trends, coupled with growing confidence in a more rapid recovery in economic activity if restrictions continue to be eased, are likely to support house prices for some time to come, particularly given the continued shortage of properties for sale.” In London, mining stocks are under pressure following the slowdown in China’s exports. Commodities giant Anglo American (-2%), copper producer Antofagasta (-1.5%) and precious metal producer Fresnillo (-1.4%) are the top fallers. Weaker export growth could indicate less demand for raw materials such as iron ore, copper, coal, nickel and zinc. But the wider FTSE 100 is up 0.2%, or 13 points, at 7082 points. UK focused companies are in the risers, including housebuilders, banks such as Barclays (+1.9%), telecoms operator BT (+1.8%) and Royal Mail (+1.8%). Neil Wilson of Markets.com says investors are waiting for US inflation data later this week, for fresh signals as to when America’s Federal Reserve might slow its stimulus programme. The FTSE 100 is the only early riser as European equity markets opened the week broadly in the red as Chinese trade data maybe just weighed a touch with exports lower than forecast despite imports growing at the fastest clip in 10 years. In London, housebuilders led gains while basic resources stocks fell. Asian shares were mixed, US futures are slightly weaker this morning. It’s a light data docket today – all eyes on the inflation data from the US later in the week alongside the upcoming ECB meeting. Last week’s US Non-Farm Payroll report (showing fewer new jobs than expected) seemed to calm inflation worries, Wilson points out: Friday’s jobs report was something Goldilocks-like: not too cold to douse confidence in the economic recovery in the US, but also not so hot as to make the Fed take its feet off the gas too early.... Inflation remains squarely in focus and the largest potential source of investors angst and market volatility this week. April’s CPI print jumped to 4.2%, the highest since 2008. The month-on-month increase in the core reading of 0.9% was the strongest since 1982. Given this, the monthly core reading will be the main focus as it will offer a guide on just how transitory or otherwise the pop in inflation is likely to be. European stock markets have begun the new week in the red. The pan-European Stoxx 600 has dropped by 0.3%, away from last week’s record high. Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC are both down almost 0.4%. In Frankfurt, chipmaker Infineon Technologies (-1.3%) and chemicals firm Linde (-1.3%) are among the fallers, along with takeaway operator Delivery Hero (-2%) and energy firms RWE (-1.1%) and Siemens Energy (-1.6%). The bad news for manufacturers, and consumers, is that the global shortage of semiconductors won’t end soon. Singapore’s Flex, one of the world’s largest electronics contract manufacturers, has warned that it will take at least a year for supplies to catch up with demand, the Financial Times reports this morning. That would mean more delays and disruption for industries around the world, such as carmakers and technology manufacturers. And it’s likely to result in higher prices, with factories already reporting that input costs are rising extremely rapidly this year. The FT says: A rapid rebound in vehicle sales combined with a lockdown-driven boom in games consoles, laptops and televisions has left the world’s chipmakers overwhelmed by the sharp increase in demand. Singapore-based Flex has more than 100 sites in 30 countries and manufactures devices and electronics for companies including Ford, British household appliances designer Dyson, UK online grocer Ocado and US computer and printer maker HP. Its position in the supply chain makes it a large buyer of chips. Lynn Torrel, Flex’s chief procurement and supply chain officer, said that the manufacturers it relies on for semiconductors have pushed back their forecasts for when the shortage will end. “With such strong demand, the expectation is mid to late-2022 depending on the commodity. Some are expecting [shortages to continue] into 2023,” she said. The German factory orders report also shows that real turnover in manufacturing fell by 2.6% in April, compared with March. That could be another sign that supply shortages are hampering the sector, as Germany tries to return to growth after suffering a 1.8% contraction in the first quarter of 2021. Oliver Rakau of Oxford Economics tweets that bottlenecks appear to be hurting German industry: German factories have reported a drop in orders - another sign that supply shortages are causing ructions. New manufacturing orders at Europe’s largest economy dropped by 0.2% month-on-month - missing forecasts of a 1% gain (according to a Reuters poll). The weakness was driven by a drop in domestic orders, which fell by 4.3%, while overseas orders rose by 2.7% month-on-month, the Economy Ministry reported. Orders for intermediate goods (products designed to be used in a finished item) fell 1.0%, while capital goods inched by by 0.2% and new orders for consumer products rose by 1.4%. Bloomberg says it’s a sign that supply shortages and higher prices are undercutting Germany’s economic recovery, adding: Manufacturing has been a stronghold in Europe’s largest economy over the past months, benefiting from earlier recoveries in places such as China and the U.S. Lately though, businesses have run into unprecedented supply-chain issues amid shortages of parts and raw materials. Reuters also highlights how China’s export growth may have been hit by disruption at some major ports: “Exports surprised a bit on the downside, maybe due to the COVID cases in Guangdong province which slowed down the turnover in Shenzhen and Guangzhou ports,” said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, adding that turnover at ports in Guangdong will likely remain slow in June. Major shipping companies warned clients of worsening congestion at Shenzhen’s Yantian port in Guangdong province after the discovery of several cases among port staff. On the ground in Guangdong, factories have yet to report widespread capacity cuts over the outbreak but admitted efficiency issues as they tried to meet overseas demand. Chen Linsheng, COO at Anlan, a Shenzhen-based manufacturer of skincare and beauty-care devices, told Reuters while there was no impact on production, staff are now subject to a series of COVID tests and not allowed back into the factory without a negative result. “We are not allowed going out (of the city). We need to report in advance and cannot even go to Guangzhou or Foshan on our own,” said Chen, adding that a lot of meetings have moved back online. More here: China’s imports grow at fastest pace in decade as materials prices surge Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The global chip shortage, rising raw material costs and creaking supply chains are all weighing on the global economy as it tries to recover from the shock of the Covid-19 pandemic. And new trade data from China suggests these factors are now biting into growth. China’s exports slowed in May, growing by 27.9% year-on-year, down from 32.3% in April. That’s weaker than economists had expected. It suggests the sharp recovery from the pandemic may be slowing -- due to ongoing Covid-19 disruption, and deepening problems getting hold of semiconductors. Imports surged by 51.1% in May - the fastest jump in a decade. But that growth in import values was fueled by surging commodity prices in the scramble for metals and fuel, which is creating concerns about rising inflation. Iris Pang of ING says China’s car industry was hurt by the shortage of semiconductors: The main reason for the shortfall is that all export items related to semiconductor chips have slowed. Auto processing products and parts, the biggest export item, fell 4%YoY in terms of export value. This is most likely the result of the semiconductor chip shortage. Pang also points out that recent Covid-19 outbreaks are also hitting trade. which could drive up consumer prices in the shops. Since the end of May, there have been around 10 Covid cases daily in Guangdong, where most electronics factories are located. Shipments from the port in Shenzhen that process most of the electronic throughput have been affected by Covid. Port workers now have to have Covid tests and port operations have been disrupted. Some factories in Guangdong were also affected by Covid, mostly caused by workers queuing up for testing. As such we expect June trade and production data will be affected. This could push up prices of electronic goods in general and affect China’s export prices and eventually import prices in the US and Europe. Supply chains in Asia will also likely be disrupted. More here: China: Exports slow but imports jump Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, said while import prices increased at a rapid pace, import volumes probably edged down in May. “Once again, supply constraints are partly to blame – inbound shipments of semiconductors continued to drop back. So too did imports of industrial metals.” Commodity prices have dipped following the data, with traders anticipating that future demand may be slower than expected Also coming up today Experts are digesting the deal on a minimum global corporation tax rate of 15%, agreed by leading finance ministers on Saturday. The G7 also agreed that countries should have the right to tax the largest, most profitable multinationals’ profit in the locations where it is generated, a landmark moment. But Amazon could escape paying this clampdown on the “largest and most profitable multinational enterprises”, due to its low profit margins. Richard Murphy, visiting professor of accounting at the Sheffield University management school, said the 10% profits threshold was “inappropriate” because of different business models for different companies. He added that current approaches to reporting profits in each country were “easily gamed”. “This could turn out to be a false hope unless they get the detail right.” Mortgage lender Halifax’s latest house price index is expected to confirm that prices have surged around 10% in the last year.

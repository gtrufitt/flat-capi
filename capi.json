Coco Gauff kicks things off on Philippe-Chatrier against Barbora Krejcikova. At 17, she is the youngest grand slam quarter-finalist for 15 years, but you can’t help feeling that this is just another tiny milestone in what will surely be a remarkable career. </p> <p>Both players will be nervous, though. The unseeded Krejcikova beat Sloane Stephens to reach this stage but admitted afterwards that she nearly didn’t take the court in the fourth-round due to nerves. She is traditionally a doubles player, but this is the first time she has reached the last eight of a grand slam. </p> <p><em>“You know, half an hour before the match, I didn’t even want to step on the court, because I just felt really bad, and I had to lock myself in the physio room and I had to talk to my psychologist. I was actually crying. We talked about it a lot, and she told me, ‘If you can overcome this, what you feel right now, it’s going to be a huge win, and it doesn’t matter if you’re going to win on the court or lose on the court, because it’s going to be a personal win’.” I think after the first point things got a little bit better, a little bit easier. Then I broke her. I just felt like yeah, you know, I can play, I can actually play her. So I think I was just more stressed that I’m just not going to be good enough. I think that’s what happened.”</em></p> <p>We join the match with Gauff an break up at 3-0 in the first set. After a double fault on the first point of the match, Gauff has certainly come out of the traps with more authority. Perhaps with the above comments, that is not surprising. But perhaps Krejcikova will take her time to grow into the match. </p> <h2>Wednesday’s order of play</h2> <ul> <li>Coco Gauff v Barbora Krejcíkova</li> <li>Maria Sakkari v Iga Swiatek</li> </ul> <p><em>Not before 3pm BST</em></p> <ul> <li>Diego Schwartzman v Rafael Nadal</li> </ul> <p><em>Not before 8pm</em></p> <ul> <li>Novak Djokovic v Matteo Berrettini</li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-06-09T09:47:30.870Z\">at 10.47am BST</time></p>  </div>","wordcount":"798","firstPublicationDate":"2021-06-09T09:23:42Z","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2021-06-09T09:54:59Z","liveBloggingNow":"true","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/p/hmxg5","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb1fc61182fe8acab0cd6e0f4baafd59dfa30d8a/0_307_5155_3094/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","isLive":"true","bodyText":"First set: Gauff 5-4 Krejcikova* (*denotes next server) Gauff’s first ace takes her to 30-15, before another takes her to set point at 40-30.

The cap on 30 attendees was one of the restrictions the UK government roadmap touted being lifted “no earlier” than 21 June. Jenrick said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We’ve always said that the roadmap is subject to review of the data, and that is what is happening right now.

When the pandemic then hit, Cummings urged civil servants to hire the company Public First to hold focus groups on the government’s Covid-19 health messaging. Mrs Justice O’Farrell, who gave the ruling on the Cabinet Office contract with the company Public First, said: “The decision of 5 June 2020 to award the contract to Public First gave rise to apparent bias and was unlawful.” Read more of David Conn’s report for us here: Covid contract for firm run by Cummings friends was unlawful, judge rules Indonesia has reported 7,725 new coronavirus infections, the highest daily number since 26 February, data from the country’s Covid-19 taskforce showed. Reuters note that the task force also reported 170 people died from Covid on Wednesday, taking the total to 52,162. Joseph Sipalan has this despatch for Reuters from Kuala Lumpur, where he reports Malaysia’s king has started a series of meetings with leaders of political parties, amid public discontent over the government’s handling of a coronavirus crisis that has forced the nation into a third lockdown. Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin’s administration imposed strict Covid-19 measures from June 1-14 to address a surge in infections and deaths, on top of an ongoing national emergency to curb the spread of the disease. But those have led to public frustration over a perceived slow rollout of vaccinations, haphazard policymaking and uneven enforcement of coronavirus curbs that critics say royalty and elites have been allowed to skirt. Opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, who spent an hour with King Al-Sultan Abdullah, said the national emergency has done more harm than good. “We presented our view that allowing this emergency to continue will lead to losses to the country,” Anwar told reporters. “It does not help with the handling of Covid and it effects the economy, especially those in the lower rungs of society.” Muhyiddin was the first to meet with the king, ahead of his weekly cabinet meeting. Other political leaders are expected at the palace over the next few days, including ex-premier Mahathir Mohamad. In a statement, the national palace said the king has convened a special meeting of the council of rulers on Wednesday to discuss efforts to battle the epidemic during the emergency. Intensive care beds for Covid patients in Malaysia have reached full capacity [see 6.11], according to the country’s health director general, who said the country’s pandemic remained at a critical level. My colleague Sarah Marsh has a recap here of those important words from NHS Providers chief executive, Chris Hopson, that the link between Covid cases and deaths has been broken. Three people were killed in a blaze that broke out at a Russian hospital treating patients with Covid-19, authorities said, with one official suggesting a faulty ventilator was to blame. The fire broke out in the early hours of Wednesday at a hospital in the city of Ryazan, some 180 kilometres (112 miles) from Moscow, in a ward treating Covid-19 patients. The region’s governor, Nikolai Lyubimov, told state television that a ventilator in the ward had overheated and caught fire, the Interfax news agency reported. Nurses attempted to extinguish the blaze, but were unsuccessful in doing so, with some of them sustaining severe burns, the governor said. Reuters note that since the start of the pandemic, Russia has reported several fires at intensive care units that doctors said were caused by malfunctioning ventilators used to treat patients severely ill with the virus. Andrew Sparrow has begun publishing our UK live blog for the day. I suspect there will be a lot of politics in it today. I’ll continue to have top UK lines as well as the global Covid news. Russia has reported 10,407 new coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours, its highest number of daily infections since early March, taking the national tally to 5,156,250 since the pandemic began. Regular readers will note that I’ve expressed some scepticism about how Russia’s official figures basically haven’t moved for months, which doesn’t feel like how the pandemic has behaved elsewhere. Reuters said the government coronavirus task force reported 399 people had died, pushing the national death toll to 124,895. The federal statistics agency has kept a separate toll and has said that Russia recorded around 270,000 deaths related to Covid-19 between April 2020 and April 2021. Gerald Imray reports for Associated Press from Cape Town that in South Africa, which has Africa’s most robust economy and its biggest coronavirus caseload, just 0.8% of the population is fully vaccinated. Hundreds of thousands of the country’s health workers, many of whom come face-to-face with the virus every day, are still waiting for their shots. The picture is similar with other African nations. In Nigeria, Africa’s biggest country with more than 200 million people, only 0.1% are fully protected. Kenya, with 50 million people, is even lower. Uganda has recalled doses from rural areas because it doesn’t have nearly enough to fight outbreaks in big cities. Chad didn’t administer its first vaccine shots until this past weekend. And there are at least five other countries in Africa where not one dose has been put into an arm, according to the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The World Health Organization says the continent of 1.3 billion people is facing a severe shortage of vaccine at the same time a new wave of infections is rising across Africa. Vaccine shipments into Africa have ground to a “near halt”, WHO said last week. In an interview, Nkengasong called on the leaders of wealthy nations meeting this week at the G7 summit to share spare vaccines – something the US has already agreed to do – and avert a “moral catastrophe”. “I’d like to believe that the G7 countries, most of them having kept excess doses of vaccines, want to be on the right side of history,” Nkengasong said. “Distribute those vaccines. We need to actually see these vaccines, not just … promises and goodwill.” Others are not so patient, nor so diplomatic. “People are dying. Time is against us. This IS INSANE,” South African human rights lawyer Fatima Hasan, an activist for equal access to health care, wrote in a series of text messages. NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson has told Times Radio this morning that vaccines appear to have “broken” the link between infections, hospital admission and deaths in the UK, and hospitals were reporting less sick, younger patients than before. He added: “And if, and it is a big if, if Bolton has gone through its complete cycle and if others areas follow Bolton, the view from the hospital there was that they were able to cope with the level of infections. “It’s important not to just focus on the raw numbers here … you also do need to look at who’s being admitted into hospital and how clinically vulnerable and what level of acuity they’ve got. “What chief executives are consistently telling us is that it is a much younger population that is coming in, they are less clinically vulnerable, they are less in need of critical care and therefore they’re seeing what they believe is significantly lower mortality rate which is, you know, borne out by the figures. So it’s not just the numbers of people who are coming in, it’s actually the level of harm and clinical risk.” However, PA Media reports he said those people who are admitted but survive may still end up with long Covid. Taiwan has reported 274 new local cases of Covid-19 today, mostly in New Taipei city. Another 25 people have died, bringing Taiwan’s total death toll to 296. Health authorities have just given their daily update, and the numbers are higher than the previous two days but lower than last week. There are currently 2,542 people in hospital and 1,486 with milder cases in centralised quarantine facilities. More than 10% of deaths – which have skewed older in this outbreak – occurred before the patient got to hospital, Testing capacity has also increased, with the ability for 48,000 PCR tests a day, up from 27,600. Health and welfare minister Chen Shih-chung has also reminded local governments that they should be following the protocols established under alert level 3, which limits gatherings and closes some shops, but doesn’t lock people inside. He made the comments in response to reports of the Miaoli county government ordering migrant workers be kept to their dorms and not allowed out except to go to work. A growing cluster of hundreds of cases across four factories is quickly becoming the new focus of this outbreak, and there are a lot of allegations around that migrant workers – of whom there are around 430,000 in the manufacturing industry primarily living in dormitories – are being treated at a different standard to Taiwanese employees. There is some pushback on the government’s handling of this outbreak, including its preparations for the known risk of outbreaks in migrant worker dorms, and over the level 3 rules for the general public. Employers are still only encouraged to facilitate working from home, and there are wide reports that many are still making workers go in - even if not strictly necessary. Meanwhile outdoor areas are closed. Dr David Nabarro, special envoy on Covid-19 for the World Health Organization, has said British prime minister Boris Johnson’s commitment to vaccinating the entire world by the end of next year could be a “gift for generations to come”. “I am absolutely delighted that the British prime minister has made this call to action for the world to get vaccinated by the end of next year,” he told Sky News.“And he’s going to use his leadership of the G7 group of nations to make this point. “So I think like many, I am hoping that world leaders in the G7 will just say very clearly: ‘We are going to work together to make sure that the world is vaccinated adequately by the end of 2022’. That would be a gift for generations to come. And it’s the kind of leadership that really we’re expecting and hoping to see in the coming weeks.” He added: “The reality is that it will be a massive undertaking to ensure that everybody has access to a vaccine, it will be a massive undertaking to make sure that enough vaccine is available and the vaccines are constantly modified in the light of new variants emerging. But this is doable. “It’s not in the big scheme of things a massive expenditure, it just requires everybody saying we’re going to work together on this job.” Nabarro may have over-estimated not only the extent to which Boris Johnson habitually sees his grand projects through to the end – garden bridge anyone? – but also under-estimated practicalities of it. Yesterday my colleague Sarah Boseley assessed how feasible it might be… The mayor of Greater Manchester in England, Andy Burnham, has offered a rare bit of praise to the government for “surging support” into areas where there are high case numbers after health secretary Matt Hancock announced that a “strengthened package of support” will be provided for Greater Manchester and Lancashire. “We very much appreciate the help of the government. It’s a reversal of where we were last year,” he said on BBC Breakfast. “Then we were getting restrictions put on us without support. This is an approach where the restrictions are being managed nationally through the road map. We’ve been working closely with the government on this. It’s a sensible approach and we support it.” Burnham has encouraged residents in parts of Lancashire and Greater Manchester to “minimise” the number of people they watch England’s Euro 2020 match against Croatia with this weekend after a rise in coronavirus cases in the areas. PA report he said: “If you look to this weekend with the weather looking good in Greater Manchester, which is great for everybody with the football coming, we would say minimise the number of people you watch the match with. Watch it outside if you can.” Burnham has also been on the Radio 4 Today programme, where he is been making the point that surge vaccinations could provide a key route out of the local restrictions that areas of the north-west of England are being asked to follow. There’s already been some pushback on that investigation by the CMA into the refund policies of British Airways and Ryanair, as you might imagine. PA Media is reporting that a spokeswoman for British Airways said the company has issued more than 3m refunds. They added: “We continue to offer highly flexible booking policies at the same time as operating a vastly reduced schedule due to government-imposed travel restrictions, and we have acted lawfully at all times. “It is incredible that the government is seeking to punish further an industry that is on its knees, after prohibiting airlines from meaningful flying for well over a year now. “Any action taken against our industry will only serve to destabilise it, with potential consequences for jobs, business, connectivity and the UK economy.” The UK’s competition watchdog has launched action against British Airways and Ryanair over their refusal to give refunds to people during UK lockdowns, when they were “lawfully unable to fly” due to travel bans and restrictions imposed by the government. BA offered vouchers or rebooking and Ryanair only the option to rebook. The Competition and Markets Authority started an investigation in December. It said this morning it is “concerned that, by failing to offer people their money back, both firms may have breached consumer law and left people unfairly out of pocket. It is now seeking to resolve these concerns with the companies, which may include seeking refunds, or other redress, for affected customers”. This relates to “periods when it was unlawful in one or more parts of the UK for people to travel for non-essential reasons. It covers flights that were not cancelled, and does not cover any other situations”. Andrea Coscelli, the chief executive of the CMA, said: While we understand that airlines have had a tough time during the pandemic, people should not be left unfairly out of pocket for following the law. Customers booked these flights in good faith and were legally unable to take them due to circumstances entirely outside of their control. We believe these people should have been offered their money back. My colleague Julia Kollewe will have more on this as it unfolds on our business live blog: UK’s CMA launches action against BA and Ryanair over refunds – business live UK government ministers could not justify spending millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money hiring consultants to assess applicants for its £500m Covid emergency support package for charities, despite clear bid processes already existing, according to cross-party MPs. Ministers were also unable to explain why a team of political special advisers was given an unusually central role in deciding which charities would receive funding, or why some charities received cash even though their bids initially received low scores. The public accounts committee (PAC) said there was a “notable opaqueness” surrounding decisions on how funds were distributed to charities, with little clarity about how the cash was shared regionally, or what impact it had. MPs were examining the £513m allocated to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) last year to provide financial support for charities to help them meet increased demand during the pandemic. An additional £200m went to hospice charities via the Department of Health and Social Care. The PAC chair, Meg Hillier, said that it was not the first time during the pandemic “worrying smoke” had been thrown up by ministers around Covid support funding decisions, with “growing instances of the official processes overridden without adequate explanations”. “Exorbitant funds” having been spent by consultants without the impact being measured was a recurring pandemic theme, she added. “I fear one clear impact is the steady erosion of taxpayers’ trust that their money is being well spent in this national emergency.” Read more of Patrick Butler’s report here: Millions spent on consultants for Covid scheme ‘not justified’, MPs say The UK’s housing secretary Robert Jenrick is on media duties this morning, and he has said that coronavirus cases are “clearly rising” and that the government is reviewing a range of data to make a decision on the further lifting of restrictions on 21 June. PA Media reports he told Sky News: “The prime minister is reviewing the data, and more data is coming in, which is very important. We created this five-week period between the stages of the road map and that has actually proved invaluable on this occasion, because it’s a finely balanced decision. “We need to see that data of cases, which are clearly rising, but the link to hospitalisations and ultimately to death. So the prime minister is reviewing that ahead of the decision point, which is going to be 14 June – at that point of course he will let everybody know what the ultimate decision is.” He was pressed particularly on the impact on wedding planning, and the current uncertainty over how many people will be able to attend ceremonies during July. The cap on 30 attendees was one of the restrictions the UK government roadmap touted being lifted “no earlier” than 21 June. Jenrick said: We’ve always said that the roadmap is subject to review of the data, and that is what is happening right now. So whether it’s weddings, or international travel, or any of these other important topics, you always have to wait until the judgment is made on the basis of the data. I wouldn’t make plans until you’ve heard from the PM, if that’s important to you, but weddings can go ahead right now but just with the maximum 30 guests. Mongolia is the latest country to begin holding an election where Covid restrictions are in place for voting, and where the handling of the pandemic is going to be a major factor in swaying the vote. The winner will become the sixth president he vast landlocked nation of 3 million people since the peaceful transition from communism to democracy in 1992. Incumbent Battulga Khaltmaa of the Democratic party is barred by the constitution from seeking a second six-year term. Voters are required to observe social distancing, and restrictions on public gatherings have severely curtailed campaign events, prompting candidates to shift much of their outreach to voters online. Mongolia’s already ailing economy has been thrown into crisis due to the pandemic, with 69,022 cases and 324 deaths reported and the number of new local infections hitting a daily record last week. That has forced the temporary closure of markets and other enterprises in the capital of Ulaanbaatar. Pandemic-related disruptions in demand for Mongolia’s chief exports such as coal and copper are also dragging on the economy. Doctors, pharmacists and workplaces in Australia can now incentivise people to receive the Covid-19 vaccine by offering rewards including cash, prizes and complementary and alternative medicines, in a move a professor of public health and expert on drugs regulation, Prof Ken Harvey, has described as “utter craziness”. Since Covid-19 vaccines became available in Australia from February, some doctors have expressed frustration that strict rules around the promotion and advertising of medicines enforced by drugs regulator the Therapeutic Goods Administration has meant they could not promote the vaccines as freely as they would have liked, including directly to patients during consults, or on social media. The regulations are important because they prevent drugs companies and health professionals from making exaggerated claims about medicines and medical devices, and stop drug companies from advertising prescription drugs directly to consumers including through television, radio and social media. But the regulations have also made vaccine promotion difficult during the pandemic. In response, the TGA amended the rules, though only for the promotion of Covid-19 vaccines. While health professionals, corporate entities and media outlets can now communicate information publicly about TGA-approved Covid-19 vaccines, this information must be consistent with current commonwealth health messaging. Any promotion must not reference brand names such as Pfizer or AstraZeneca or any active ingredients that might identify the vaccines. The rules do not allow any statements saying vaccines do not cause harm, or any false or misleading information. Read more of Melissa Davey’s report here: Covid vaccine incentives – Australian doctors now allowed to offer cash, prizes and alternative medicines Also worth noting, the UK has not been included in a mass update of international travel warnings from the US State Department mentioned earlier [see 6.46am]. PA Media notes that the department has changed its advice for dozens of nations, including France, Spain and Italy, from “Level 4: Do Not Travel” to “Level 3: Reconsider Travel”, according to its website. The UK has been designated Level 3 since May 10. The Level 3 advice allows travel for fully vaccinated citizens, with a warning they should “avoid travel due to serious risks to safety and security”. However, the UK is still subject to a presidential decree which prohibits non-US citizens who have been in the UK in the last 14 days from entering the country. The full list can be found on the state department website here: US state department travel advisories Overnight PA’s Joe Gammie has rounded-up some more response from the travel industry on the traffic-light system being used for international travel in England – and it is not a warm welcome for it. London-based World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) said the Government must scrap the system which has “wreaked havoc” among consumers and businesses in order to save hundreds of thousands of jobs. Portugal being moved from the green to amber caught many holidaymakers by surprise and left thousands of UK tourists scrambling to get home before new quarantine rules came into force on Tuesday morning. The WTTC said that moving to a more transparent and easier to understand system will restore consumer confidence and provide a “much-needed” boost to the travel and tourism sector. It warned that a further 218,000 jobs were at “serious risk” if international travel continued to be off limits for most of the summer, on top of the 307,000 jobs which were lost in the UK sector last year. WTTC acting CEO Virginia Messina said: “It’s time the Government abandoned the hugely damaging traffic lights system. Consumers, airlines and the wider travel sector were promised a watchlist and three weeks’ notice of any changes from green to amber, and not just four days. “It has been incredibly disruptive and costly for both travel and tourism businesses and consumers. It simply hasn’t worked. What’s needed now is a watertight government policy enabling those who’ve been fully jabbed to travel freely, and not have to self-isolate on their return. “Those who are not fully vaccinated should be able to travel with proof of a negative test, like what we are seeing in the EU. The travel sector needs this now if it is to survive this summer as domestic travel alone will not save the day.” It is already clear what one of the main topics of the UK’s morning media round is going to be: presenters trying to trip up ministers over Andrew Lloyd-Webber’s claim that he was going to reopen his theatres come-what-may and is willing to be arrested over it. The composer said he may have to sell his six West End venues if the government does not remove restrictions that have forced venues to run with reduced capacities. Lloyd Webber is preparing for a production of Cinderella, which is scheduled to open for previews on 25 June ahead of its world premiere in July. “We are going to open, come hell or high water,” Lord Lloyd-Webber told the Telegraph. Asked what he would do if the government postponed lifting lockdown, he said: “We will say: ‘come to the theatre and arrest us.”’ On Sky News, Kay Burley has already been repeatedly pressing housing minister Robert Jenrick on whether Lloyd-Webber should be arrested. For a government that indulged Dominic Cumming’s trip to Durham last year, it is always tricky for a minister to flat-out state that someone should just obey the rules. I’m not sure this is the most enlightening way to tease out current government thinking on whether there will be a delay to England’s planned 21 June reopening. It may well feel like a very long morning of interviews for Jenrick. Confidence in the EU’s ability to handle crises has taken a hit from Covid-19, a major survey shows, but dissatisfaction with national political systems is even higher and most people still support EU membership and want a stronger, more cooperative bloc. The report’s authors suggested the polling should be a wake-up call for Brussels, warning that while public support for the broader European project remained high in many countries, it was fragile and would not easily survive more disappointment. Europeans were “making a distinction between the need for cooperation and solidarity at a European level, and their confidence in the EU to deliver”, they said, and were unhappy the bloc had “missed an opportunity to prove its worth”. The polling also suggested Brexit had changed Europeans’ views of the UK, with the prevailing view now seeing Britain – like the US – as a “necessary partner” to be “strategically cooperated with” rather than an ally, and one in four Germans and one in five French and Spanish respondents considering it as a rival or adversary. The report, published by the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR) on Wednesday, suggested the bloc’s poor early response to the pandemic and slow initial vaccine rollout had dealt a heavy blow to confidence in its capabilities. Read Jon Henley’s full report here: Europeans’ confidence in EU hit by coronavirus response Chinese authorities in Guangdong have taken extraordinary measures to make sure students have been able to sit the crucial gaokao college entrance exams amid an outbreak in the city of Guangzhou. From AFP: The local government has dispatched hundreds of taxis and buses to ferry students from neighbourhoods affected by the outbreak to exam venues, with state broadcaster CCTV showing footage of drivers in hazmat suits spraying down their cars. Students were split into different rooms based on their level of Covid-19 risk, with contacts of confirmed cases taking the tests in smaller groups. But infected students with mild symptoms had to take the tough exams solo in brightly lit isolation rooms in the hospital or special locations. CCTV footage showed one student sitting at a lone desk and scratching his head as he read the exam paper, a bottle of hand sanitizer on the desk and officials monitoring him on a TV screen. Other state footage showed masked examiners in protective clothing removing completed exam papers from infected students and hanging them up on a clothes-drying rack to be sprayed down with disinfectant. Provincial officials inspected testing sites in Guangzhou late last week and urged examiners to make sure “students feel comfortable, parents are at ease and society is reassured,” the local government said. Last year’s gaokao exams were delayed as schools hesitated to resume mass activities due to the coronavirus, which first emerged in the country in late 2019. Life in China has since returned almost to normal, with authorities responding to sporadic outbreaks with aggressive testing and localised quarantines. Guangzhou authorities shut down cinemas and karaoke bars across the city on Tuesday, and have locked down neighbourhoods and ordered travellers leaving the city to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test. China reported eight locally transmitted Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, all of which were detected in Guangdong province. Reuters: The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has eased travel recommendations for more than 110 countries and territories, including Japan just ahead of the Olympics. The Biden administration is forming expert working groups with Canada, Mexico, the European Union and Britain to determine how best to safely restart travel after 15 months of pandemic restrictions, a White House official said on Tuesday. The CDC’s new ratings include 61 nations that were lowered from its highest “level 4” rating that discouraged all travel to recommending travel for fully vaccinated individuals, the agency confirmed on Tuesday. An additional 50 countries and territories have been lowered to “level 2” or “level 1,” a CDC spokeswoman said. Countries ranked lowest for Covid-19 risks now include Singapore, Israel, South Korea, Iceland, Belize and Albania. Among those now listed at “level 3,” are France, Ecuador, the Philippines, South Africa, Canada, Mexico, Russia, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, Honduras, Hungary and Italy. A US pharmacist has been jailed for three years after pleading guilty to trying to spoil hundreds of doses of the Moderna vaccine because he was skeptical about them. The US justice department said on Tuesday the 46-year-old man had also been ordered to pay $83,800 in compensation to the hospital at which he worked. According to a statement from the Wisconsin eastern district’s US Attorney’s office, he pleaded guilty to two counts of attempting to tamper with consumer products with reckless disregard for the risk that another person would be placed in danger of death or bodily injury. According to justice department, in December 2020 the man deliberately removed a box of vaccine vials from a hospital refrigeration unit on two successive night shift. Moderna’s vaccine has to be stored and shipped frozen but can be stored for 30 days in standard-temperature refrigerators. The statement said the man was generally skeptical of vaccines, and the Moderna vaccine specifically. It said he had shared his beliefs with co-workers for at least the past two years. Intensive care beds for Covid patients in Malaysia have reached full capacity, according to the country’s health director general, who said the country’s pandemic remained at a critical level. Malaysia entered a near total lockdown on 1 June, after daily cases rose to more than 9,000 last month. The increase in cases has been blamed on the more infectious variants of the virus, as well as gatherings held ahead of Eid al-Fitr. Malaysia’s health director general, Noor Hisham Abdullah, said hospitals were facing a rise in severe cases of Covid, especially among older and clinically vulnerable people, who needed oxygen and respiratory assistance. “These patients need a long recovery period to heal, due to serious complications from Covid-19,” he said. The pressure placed on intensive care units, which are at 100% capacity, was very worrying, Noor Hisham said, adding some patients who needed critical care could not be placed in an ICU bed. While new infections have fallen slightly over the past two weeks, there were still 82,797 active cases under treatment and observation as of 8 June. Malaysia managed to contain the virus for much of 2020, and had recorded fewer than 500 fatalities by January. The country’s death toll has since risen to 3,536, while 627,652 cases have been recorded. Hospital morgues have been forced to use containers to cope with the rise in fatalities. Malaysia imposed a national lockdown on 1 June, shutting schools and shopping malls. Only two people from each household are allowed to go out to buy essentials or seek medical treatment within 10km of their home. The manufacturing sector, however, has been allowed to continue operating at a reduced capacity. Malaysia began its vaccination campaign in February, and 7.7% of the population has since received at least one dose Hello and welcome to the continuing coverage of the global pandemic. Here are some of the major developments in the last day. Guangzhou city in China has ordered the closures of cinemas, theatres, nightclubs and other indoor entertainment venues amid an outbreak. The US and the European Union are expected to support a renewed push into investigating the origins of Covid-19 after conflicting assessments about where the outbreak started, according to Bloomberg News. Residents of Melbourne in Australia will come out a tough lockdown on Thursday night, but will still be subject to restrictions including 25km travel limits Washington is also forming working parties with Brussels, Canada, and Mexico to determine how best to safely restart international travel. It came as the World Travel and Tourism Council said the UK government had to scrap its traffic light system for travel because it had “wreaked havoc”. Portugal will allow vaccinated US tourists into the country, Reuters reports. “We are in a position to approve the opening of non-essential travel and flights to people from the US to Portugal as long as they have a vaccination certificate,” economy minister Pedro Siza Vieira, cited by Portuguese radio Renascenca, said. Vaccine passports will be used for the first time at UK sporting events for England’s Euro 2020 group games at Wembley stadium, with those not fully vaccinated able to show proof of a negative lateral flow test taken within the previous 48 hours. World Bank president David Malpass said the institution does not support waiving intellectual property rights for Covid-19 vaccines at the World Trade Organization, claiming it is out of concern that it would hamper innovation in the pharmaceuticals sector. South Africa’s president Cyril Ramaphosa placed the country’s health minister on “special leave” over alleged links to a corruption scandal involving coronavirus communications funding. Pfizer is to begin testing its Covid-19 vaccine on a larger cohort of thousands of children under 12 years old in the US, Finland, Poland and Spain after selecting a lower dose of the shot in an earlier stage of the trial. A top White House official has urged state governors to work with the US Food and Drug Administration to extend the shelf life of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s Covid vaccine as millions of unused doses nationwide near expiration. Many thousands of vaccine doses have been destroyed in African countries after exceeding their expiry dates amid a reluctance to be inoculated and a lack of medical infrastructure, while some jabs were donated relatively late in their shelf life. Music fans flocked to the first unrestricted European festival since the pandemic began over the weekend at an event in Albania that had 10,000 attendees across four days, with everyone showing proof of a recent negative test. Washington state is to give adults a free cannabis spliff after they receive a Covid jab in an attempt to accelerate vaccination uptake through a promotion coined “Joints for Jabs” by the state’s liquor and cannabis board.","charCount":"35358","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a> (now) and <a href=\"profile/helen-davidson\">Helen Davidson</a> (earlier)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2021/jun/09/state-of-origin-2021-game-1-live-qld-queensland-maroons-vs-nsw-blues-teams-kick-off-time-start-channel-nine-townsville","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-09T09:51:23Z","webTitle":"State of Origin 2021 Game 1: Qld Maroons v NSW Blues – live!","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2021/jun/09/state-of-origin-2021-game-1-live-qld-queensland-maroons-vs-nsw-blues-teams-kick-off-time-start-channel-nine-townsville","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2021/jun/09/state-of-origin-2021-game-1-live-qld-queensland-maroons-vs-nsw-blues-teams-kick-off-time-start-channel-nine-townsville","fields":{"headline":"State of Origin 2021 Game 1: Qld Maroons v NSW Blues – live!","standfirst":"<ul><li>Updates from the series opener tonight in Townsville</li><li>Kick-off time at Queensland Country Bank Stadium is 8:10 AEST<br></li><li>Any thoughts? <a href=\"mailto:emma.kemp@theguardian.com\">Email</a> or tweet <a href=\"https://twitter.com/emmavkemp\">@emmavkemp</a></li></ul>","trailText":"<strong>Minute-by-minute report</strong>: Townsville hosts an Origin game for the first time as the Maroons and Blues go head-to-head in the series opener.

Mrs Justice O’Farrell, who gave the ruling on the Cabinet Office contract with the company Public First, said: “The decision of 5 June 2020 to award the contract to Public First gave rise to apparent bias and was unlawful.” The ruling is the first in a series of judicial review legal challenges brought by the Good Law Project (GLP) against government Covid-19 contracts awarded with no competitive tenders under emergency regulations. The government has defended the cases determinedly, initially trying but failing to have them thrown out, then refusing to limit its costs. That has put the GLP, a not-for-profit organisation that raises money through crowdfunding to support its stated mission to “use the law to protect the interests of the public”, at severe financial risk if it loses and has to pay the government’s costs. In February, the Government Legal Department notified the GLP that its costs for defending the challenge to the Public First award could reach £600,000, more than the value of the contract. Public First is run by husband and wife policy specialists James Frayne and Rachel Wolf, both of whom previously worked with Cummings and the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove. It was initially given a Cabinet Office contract last January, having been recommended to civil servants by Cummings and three other senior Johnson staff. It conducted focus groups with mostly new Conservative party voters in northern towns, about what the government’s “levelling up” promise meant to them. When the pandemic then hit, Cummings urged civil servants to hire Public First to hold focus groups on the government’s Covid-19 health messaging. The first contract, for £90,000, was below the threshold at which an open competitive tender is legally required. Internal emails disclosed for the legal action revealed that a Cabinet Office civil servant had described that work as “Tory party research agency tests Tory party narrative on public money”. The civil servant said in a witness statement that she had not meant that seriously. The second Covid-19 contract was for a maximum of £840,000 but was awarded under regulations that waived the requirements for a tender due to the coronavirus emergency. Public First was ultimately paid £564,393 for that work. The contract also included the secondment of a Public First partner, Gabriel Milland, to work in Downing Street’s Covid-19 communications operation. When the Guardian and OpenDemocracy first revealed the contract last July, the Cabinet Office said it was “nonsense” to suggest that Frayne and Wolf’s long association with Cummings was a factor in the decision. However, when the case reached a hearing in February, Cummings confirmed in a witness statement that Frayne and Wolf were his long-term friends, and that he had been instrumental in Public First being given the Covid-19 work. Cummings said he had not requested they be brought in because they were his friends, but because he believed due to his knowledge of the company that it was the only one capable of doing the work well at such short notice. “Very few companies in this field are competent,” Cummings said, “almost none are very competent, honest and reliable”.

UK’s FTSE 100 index down 30 points, or 0.4%, at 7,064 Germany’s Dax down 44 points, or 0.3%, at 15,595 France’s CAC flat at 6,549 Italy’s FTSE MiB down 58 points, or 0.2%, at 25,748 Here is our full story: IAG, which owns British Airways as well as several other carriers including Iberia, Aer Lingus and Vueling, is now the top riser on the FTSE 100 index, up 1.6% –– despite the UK competition watchdog launching action against BA and Ryanair over their refusal to give refunds to customers who were unable to travel during coronavirus lockdowns. A BA spokesperson said: During this unprecedented crisis we have issued well over 3m refunds and helped millions of our customers change their travel dates or destinations and we’re grateful to them for their ongoing support. We continue to offer highly flexible booking policies at the same time as operating a vastly reduced schedule due to government-imposed travel restrictions, and we have acted lawfully at all times. It is incredible that the government is seeking to punish further an industry that is on its knees, after prohibiting airlines from meaningful flying for well over a year now. Any action taken against our industry will only serve to destabilise it, with potential consequences for jobs, business, connectivity and the UK economy. And Ryanair said: Ryanair today welcomed the UK CMA’s update on its review of airline policies on refund requests made by UK consumers whose flights operated during periods of lockdown. Ryanair has approached such refund requests on a case by case basis and has paid refunds in justified cases. Since June 2020, all our customers have also had the ability to rebook their flights without paying a change fee and millions of our UK customers have availed of this option. Travel stocks are up this morning after the EU parliament approved vaccine passports to ease travel this summer. This has boosted the Anglo-German tour operator Tui, along with airlines IAG, the BA owner (up 2.1%), easyJet (up 1.3%) and Ryanair (up 1%). Intercontinental Hotels Group and Premier Inn owner Whitbread are also higher, by 1% and 0.5% respectively. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, says: Meanwhile, the US eased travel restrictions for 61 countries, but not the UK. Nevertheless, there is a real sense that vaccines are working to open up the US, EU and UK to travel this summer, albeit not quite how it once was. The owner of the baguette chain Upper Crust, SSP, has fallen deep into the red as it was hammered by the slump in travel over the past year due to the coronavirus crisis. The London-based snack food group, whose outlets are at train stations and airports, made a pre-tax loss of £300m in the year to 31 March, up sharply from the previous year’s £34m loss. Like-for-like sales crashed 79% as as far fewer people travelled over the past year. Like other travel and hospitality firms, SSP has been hit hard by the pandemic. It shut 2,500 outlets, put 22,000 people globally on furlough at the peak and slashed 14,000 jobs. Things are slowly improving, with 1,150 outlets open at the moment. The company expects to have up to 1,500 open over the summer, and says it has seen a gradual recovery in passenger numbers, mainly in the UK and US. In the first week of June, sales were still down 70% versus 2019, however. Like-for-like revenues are not expected to recover to pre-Covid levels until 2024. Simon Smith, the SSP chief executive, says: The recovery in domestic and leisure travel has now begun in a number of our territories, and our teams are busy re-opening units in line with passenger demand. Prior to the pandemic, SSP served one and a half million customers every day at 180 airports and 300 rail stations in 35 countries around the world and operated more than 550 international, national and local brands.

Delivering what he said was a “huge thank you”, he said: You’ve encouraged people to stick to the rules the same time as you’ve been fighting crime and you’ve each risen to an enormous challenge. Just as I could never have imagined being forced, as prime minister, to close pubs and bars and restaurants or tell people how many households could get together, I bet that policing restrictions in that way was not something you ever dreamt you would be doing. But you did it because you knew it was how we were going to protect the NHS and save lives. Johnson also said that the government had recruited 8,771 new officers and that it was 44% of the way towards the target of 20,000 extra officers by 2023. Arlene Foster, the outgoing DUP first minister of Northern Ireland, does not seem to agree with Gavin Barwell’s analysis of who is to blame for the problems with the Northern Ireland protocol. (See 8.48am.) She has posted this response to a tweet from the former Ukip MEP Patrick O’Flynn. More than 80% of adults in England and Wales would test positive for Covid antibodies, according to figures released by the Office for National Statistics this morning. The figures are lower for Northern Ireland (79.9%) and for Scotland (72.6%). Having antibodies can protect people from further infection. People acquire antibodies either through vaccination, or from being infected in the past. But antibody levels do not correspond to the total number of people vaccinated and infected in the past because over time antibody levels reduce to the point where they are no longer detected in tests. Here are the figures for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. They cover the week beginning Monday 17 May, and they are based on the results of a survey that involves tens of thousands of people being tested at random. And these charts compare the proportion of adults testing positive for antibodies (the dark blue line) with the proportion who have had one dose of vaccine (the green line) and the proportion fully vaccinated (the light green line). Lord Frost and his EU counterpart Maroš Šefčovič, vice-president of the European Commission, have started their talks at Admiralty House in London. Although it essentially one event, technically there are two meetings taking place: a meeting of the withdrawal agreement joint committee meeting (the body set up to oversee the implementation of the withdrawal agreement, including the Northern Ireland protocol); and a meeting of the partnership council (the body set up to oversee the implementation of the UK-EU trade deal, the trade and cooperation agreement). Frost and Šefčovič jointly chair both bodies. Here is the agenda (pdf) for the withdrawal agreement joint committee meeting. And here is the agenda (pdf) for the partnership council meeting. In a statement issued last night, ahead of his meeting this morning with Maroš Šefčovič, Lord Frost, the Brexit minister, urged the EU to adopt “pragmatism” and “common sense solutions” to resolve the problems in Northern Ireland. He said: I hope this will be a productive forum where we can address shared challenges by working together in the spirit of mutual trust and cooperation.

Our overriding shared priority must be to protect the Belfast (Good Friday) agreement and the peace process. I look to the EU to show flexibility and engage with our proposals so that we can find solutions that enjoy the confidence of all communities. Further threats of legal action and trade retaliation from the EU won’t make life any easier for the shopper in Strabane who can’t buy their favourite product.

Posted on Wednesday to drum up support for New South Wales in its upcoming clash with Queensland in the State of Origin rugby league, the premier’s photo was instead widely mocked for its bizarre composition and strange elements. In the image, Berejiklian can be seen standing alone in a large room with the blinds drawn, watching a small, blurred television that is largely out of frame. With her back to the camera, the Liberal leader is holding an unopened can of sugar-free Coke. She’s wearing a Blues beanie and scarf. Within minutes of it being posted on Twitter and Facebook, the premier’s photographer and social media team were immediately criticised for having created the unsettling image. The photo was published at 4pm on Wednesday – more than four hours before the game was due to start. The premier’s televisual faux pas spawned hundreds of memes and drew comparisons to a surprisingly long list of other politicians who viewed their televisions from strange angles. In 2017, the former prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, made headlines for watching the outcome of the marriage equality postal survey on an extremely low TV, mounted inside a cabinet on the floor, while he remained standing. Later that night, he somehow found another way to observe a television incorrectly, when he watched the Socceroos beat Honduras in a World Cup qualifier from a very low angle, with the TV too high. The current prime minister, Scott Morrison, has also been snapped watching rugby on a small TV somehow mounted in the corner of a room (while pointing at it) and watching the finale of Game of Thrones on a too-large bank of TVs. Australia’s high commissioner to the UK, and former attorney general, George Brandis, watched the last federal budget on a tiny laptop while seated too far away. But on Wednesday, the fact that Berejiklian was pictured entirely from behind, with none of her face visible, also raised questions as to whether it was actually the premier in the photo. A rapidly made template also enabled many to make their own memes of the premier watching other famous historical events.","charCount":"2297","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/naaman-zhou\">Naaman Zhou</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2021/jun/08/tensions-rise-over-eu-trade-row-with-uk-over-sausage-sales","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-09T09:25:20Z","webTitle":"Trade war threats will not wash with voters, Frost tells EU as row deepens","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/08/tensions-rise-over-eu-trade-row-with-uk-over-sausage-sales","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/jun/08/tensions-rise-over-eu-trade-row-with-uk-over-sausage-sales","fields":{"headline":"Trade war threats will not wash with voters, Frost tells EU as row deepens","standfirst":"<p>UK considering unilaterally extending grace periods under Northern Ireland protocol </p>","trailText":"UK considering unilaterally extending grace periods under Northern Ireland protocol","byline":"Lisa O'Carroll and Aubrey Allegretti","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9fe75abe5b866e81dcfa5e2df9d7d929bbaad9a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9fe75abe5b866e81dcfa5e2df9d7d929bbaad9a2/0_511_7662_4599/1000.jpg\" alt=\"European Commission vice-president Maros Sefčovič, centre, arrives in London to lead the negotiations from Brussels’ side\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The European Commission vice-president Maros Sefčovič, centre, arrives in London to lead the negotiations from the Brussels’ side.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tolga Akmen/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>The row between the UK and the EU over checks on sausages and other chilled foods sent from Britain to Northern Ireland has deepened, with the Brexit minister telling Brussels that trade war threats will not wash with voters.</p> <p>As a major meeting on Wednesday approached, David Frost said: “Further threats of legal action and trade retaliation from the EU won’t make life any easier for the shopper in Strabane who can’t buy their favourite product.

As a major meeting on Wednesday approached, David Frost said: “Further threats of legal action and trade retaliation from the EU won’t make life any easier for the shopper in Strabane who can’t buy their favourite product. Nor will it benefit the small business in Ballymena struggling to source produce from their supplier in Birmingham.” His comments underline the growing gulf between Brussels and London over Northern Ireland with many expecting the US president, Joe Biden, to press Boris Johnson on the issue when they meet in Cornwall at the G7 summit later on Wednesday. A report in Politico that some EU officials and diplomats had floated a back-up plan involving checks on all goods leaving the island of Ireland is said to be causing extreme anxiety in Dublin. Such a plan has echoes of the row in January when Brussels threatened to invoke article 16 of the protocol in a row over vaccines without consulting Dublin first. Lord Frost’s comments came hours after the former French European affairs minister Nathalie Loiseau, now an MEP, warned that the EU had the power to impose quotas on British exports if it continued to make unilateral decisions on how the Northern Ireland protocol was implemented. Frost was due to dine with his European Commission counterpart, Maroš Šefčovič, in London on Tuesday night before two key meetings between the UK and the EU about Northern Ireland and other Brexit issues at 8am on Wednesday. The tenor of Frost’s statement underlines the fading hope for any breakthrough agreement on the checks, which are opposed by unionists and led to violence in Northern Ireland at Easter. The UK government is reportedly considering unilaterally extending the grace periods under the protocol that give businesses in Northern Ireland time to adapt to new rules – including for the import of chilled meats such as sausages, chicken nuggets and mince from Great Britain. The grace periods are due to expire at the end of June but, according to the Telegraph, Johnson is contemplating extending them in the face of a lack of progress towards a new agreement on about 30 issues relating to checks on animals, goods and medicines. “When I meet Maroš Šefčovič later today my message will be clear: time is short and practical solutions are needed now to make the protocol work,” said Frost. Šefčovič said on Tuesday that the EU would act “swiftly, firmly and resolutely to ensure that the UK abides by its international law obligations” if the UK decided to delay checks on chilled meats on 30 June. Loiseau told BBC Radio 4 that if the UK continues to breach the protocol, then tariffs and quotas designed to regulate the import of goods into the EU by upping the price and putting a cap on numbers could be necessary. “We don’t want to reach that,” she said. “But we are warning: you signed an agreement, you have to implement it, otherwise there are measures we can take that will protect our single market … The international reputation of the UK is at stake.” George Eustice, the environment secretary, described the threat of an “outright ban” on chicken nuggets and sausages being sent from Great Britain to Northern Ireland as “bonkers”. One EU source said Loiseau’s comments regarding the threat of trade quotas being imposed on the EU reflected the fact that the Brexit relationship had been “weaponised”, with a range of remedies and penalties at the EU’s disposal that were not there in January when the withdrawal agreement involving the Northern Ireland protocol and citizens’ rights was signed and ratified by both sides. “We now have the principle of good faith in a legal agreement and if there are any problems in the trade and cooperation agreement we have legal instruments at our disposal including trade sanctions,” the source said. Northern Irish businesses are calling on both sides to stop a Brexit “blame game” and deliver urgent solutions to end growing tensions over the checks on food and goods crossing the Irish Sea into the region. The protocol has been hugely controversial in Northern Ireland, contributing to violence over Easter and fissures in the Democratic Unionist party, which is officially campaigning to have it scrapped.","charCount":"4423","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/lisaocarroll\">Lisa O'Carroll</a> and <a href=\"profile/aubrey-allegretti\">Aubrey Allegretti</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2021/jun/09/mandabi-review-ousmane-sembene-senegal","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-09T09:00:46Z","webTitle":"Mandabi review – Ousmane Sembène classic about colonialism resonates today","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/jun/09/mandabi-review-ousmane-sembene-senegal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2021/jun/09/mandabi-review-ousmane-sembene-senegal","fields":{"headline":"Mandabi review – Ousmane Sembène classic about colonialism resonates today","standfirst":"<p>Senegalese feature from 1968 tells story of a simple family man whose life is turned upside down by the money he receives from a nephew in France</p>","trailText":"Senegalese feature from 1968 tells story of a simple family man whose life is turned upside down by the money he receives from a nephew in France","byline":"Peter Bradshaw","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"131260ef4b200df09adec49bbcaf18bc0178caf1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/131260ef4b200df09adec49bbcaf18bc0178caf1/0_101_3643_2185/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Makhourédia Guèye, Isseu Niang and Ynousse N’Diaye in Mandabi from 1968.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Franc exchange of views … Makhourédia Guèye, Isseu Niang and Ynousse N’Diaye in Mandabi from 1968.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Ousmane Sembène, the “father of African cinema”, tells a tale of Jonsonian bleakness about human nature with his 1968 film Mandabi, or The Money Order, adapted from his own novella and now on rerelease.

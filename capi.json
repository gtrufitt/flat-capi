Hi, this is Kaamil Ahmed taking over the live blog until the evening. My colleague Libby Brooks has covered concerns in Scotland over the opening of a mixed fan zone for the Euro 2020 tournament starting this week. The space in Glasgow will allow 6,000 football fans to gather daily without mandatory testing. Some of the public and health experts have questioned the step considering many restrictions are still in place and cases across Scotland are still rising. Parents in particular have been voicing anger and frustration that the fan zone has been allowed to go ahead while continuing restrictions prevent them attending nursery, primary and high school leaving events as well as end of term sports days. Martin Canavan, whose daughter attends a nursery on the Southside of Glasgow, told the Guardian: “Our wee girl was in tears when we told her we couldn’t come to her nursery graduation any more. They’ve been rehearsing their song for weeks. It feels like a pretty arbitrary decision to cancel these events when thousands can watch football, and people can drink in pubs.” Pakistan has hailed the administering of 10m doses of coronavirus vaccines as an important step towards its goal of vaccinating 70 million people by the end of the year. “Thank God, we have succeeded in administering 10m vaccine doses,” the minister in-charge for Covid-19 operations, Asad Umar, told a ceremony to mark the milestone in Islamabad. “Our target is to vaccinate up to 70 million people by the end of this year,” he said of the total adult population eligible for the vaccination out of a 220-million nation. A PA Media news agency analysis is showing that the number of people in hospital with Covid-19 in England is now a fifth higher than it was at the end of the second wave of the virus, with more regions reporting a rise in patients. A total of 879 patients with Covid-19 were in hospital in England as of 8am on 8 June, according to NHS England. This is up from 776 one week earlier – a rise of 13%. It is also up 20% from a low of 730 patients on 22 May. This comes as government ministers are reviewing the latest data on Covid-19 cases and the amount of people being taken to hospital to decide whether the planned easing of social restrictions in England on 21 June will go ahead. Patient numbers are not increasing steadily, with the total sometimes falling slightly one day before jumping again the next. But even when using a seven-day average to smooth out these kinds of fluctuations, the trend is now upwards. These figures are still well below the second-wave peak, when the number of patients reached a record high average of 33,594 on 22 January. The upwards trend is also not being reflected in every region of England. Covid-19 case rates are currently rising in four out of five local areas of England – the highest proportion since early January. Public health experts have said that the country could expect to see rising case numbers as restrictions were eased – but the key metric is whether this would lead to increased hospitalisations and a repeat risk of overwhelming the NHS. Earlier today, NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson seemed very clear that vaccines appear to have “broken” the link between infections, hospital admission and deaths in the UK. Intensive care beds for Covid patients in Malaysia have reached full capacity, according to the country’s health director general, who said the country’s pandemic remained at a critical level. Malaysia’s king has started a series of meetings with leaders of political parties, amid public discontent over the government’s handling of a coronavirus crisis that has forced the nation into a third lockdown. UK housing minister Robert Jenrick has told people hoping to get married after 21 June that “I wouldn’t make plans until you’ve heard from the prime minister” over attendance numbers. The government’s roadmap had suggested the cap of 30 attendees would be lifted “no earlier” than 21 June, and many couple will have planned on that basis. NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson has told Times Radio this morning that vaccines appear to have “broken” the link between infections, hospital admission and deaths in the UK. A judge has ruled that the UK government acted unlawfully when it awarded a contract for polling the public about Covid messaging without a tender last March. The company was owned by friends of Dominic Cummings, then British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s chief adviser. The mayor of Greater Manchester in England, Andy Burnham, has offered a rare bit of praise to the government for “surging support” into areas where there are high case numbers after health secretary Matt Hancock announced that a “strengthened package of support” will be provided for Greater Manchester and Lancashire. But he urged people to “minimise” the number of people they watch England’s Euro 2020 match against Croatia with this weekend. The UK’s competition watchdog has launched action against British Airways and Ryanair over their refusal to give refunds to people during UK lockdowns, when they were “lawfully unable to fly” due to travel bans and restrictions imposed by the government. Andrew Lloyd-Webber has said he will reopen his London theatres at the end of June regardless of restrictions, inviting the government to have him arrested. Confidence in the EU’s ability to handle crises has taken a hit from Covid-19, a major survey shows, but dissatisfaction with national political systems is even higher and most people still support EU membership and want a stronger, more cooperative bloc. Three people were killed in a blaze that broke out at a Russian hospital treating patients with Covid-19, authorities said, with one official suggesting a faulty ventilator was to blame. Additionally, Russia has reported 10,407 new coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours, its highest number of daily infections since early March. Indonesia has reported 7,725 new coronavirus infections, the highest daily number since 26 February. Taiwan has reported 274 new local cases of Covid-19 today, mostly in New Taipei city. Another 25 people have died, bringing Taiwan’s total death toll to 296. Dr David Nabarro, special envoy on Covid-19 for the World Health Organization, has said British prime minister Boris Johnson’s commitment to vaccinating the entire world by the end of next year could be a “gift for generations to come”. Doctors, pharmacists and workplaces in Australia can now incentivise people to receive the Covid-19 vaccine by offering rewards including cash, prizes and complementary and alternative medicines, in a move a professor of public health and expert on drugs regulation, Prof Ken Harvey, has described as “utter craziness”. The US state department has eased travel recommendations for more than 110 countries and territories, including Japan just ahead of the Olympics. Also in the US, a pharmacist has been jailed for three years after pleading guilty to trying to spoil hundreds of doses of the Moderna vaccine because he was skeptical about them. Andrew Sparrow has our UK live blog, which will have its main focus on Brexit, PMQs and the G7 meeting today. I’ll continue to bring you the top lines from the UK on Covid as well as the rest of the coronavirus news from around the world. One of those stories today that is likely to feature in both Andrew Sparrow’s UK politics live blog, and here on our Covid blog, but a judge has just ruled that the government acted unlawfully when it awarded a contract without a tender last March to a polling company owned by friends of Dominic Cummings, then British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s chief adviser. When the pandemic then hit, Cummings urged civil servants to hire the company Public First to hold focus groups on the government’s Covid-19 health messaging. Mrs Justice O’Farrell, who gave the ruling on the Cabinet Office contract with the company Public First, said: “The decision of 5 June 2020 to award the contract to Public First gave rise to apparent bias and was unlawful.” Read more of David Conn’s report for us here: Covid contract for firm run by Cummings friends was unlawful, judge rules Indonesia has reported 7,725 new coronavirus infections, the highest daily number since 26 February, data from the country’s Covid-19 taskforce showed. Reuters note that the task force also reported 170 people died from Covid on Wednesday, taking the total to 52,162. Joseph Sipalan has this despatch for Reuters from Kuala Lumpur, where he reports Malaysia’s king has started a series of meetings with leaders of political parties, amid public discontent over the government’s handling of a coronavirus crisis that has forced the nation into a third lockdown. Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin’s administration imposed strict Covid-19 measures from June 1-14 to address a surge in infections and deaths, on top of an ongoing national emergency to curb the spread of the disease. But those have led to public frustration over a perceived slow rollout of vaccinations, haphazard policymaking and uneven enforcement of coronavirus curbs that critics say royalty and elites have been allowed to skirt. Opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, who spent an hour with King Al-Sultan Abdullah, said the national emergency has done more harm than good. “We presented our view that allowing this emergency to continue will lead to losses to the country,” Anwar told reporters. “It does not help with the handling of Covid and it effects the economy, especially those in the lower rungs of society.” Muhyiddin was the first to meet with the king, ahead of his weekly cabinet meeting. Other political leaders are expected at the palace over the next few days, including ex-premier Mahathir Mohamad. In a statement, the national palace said the king has convened a special meeting of the council of rulers on Wednesday to discuss efforts to battle the epidemic during the emergency. Intensive care beds for Covid patients in Malaysia have reached full capacity [see 6.11], according to the country’s health director general, who said the country’s pandemic remained at a critical level. My colleague Sarah Marsh has a recap here of those important words from NHS Providers chief executive, Chris Hopson, that the link between Covid cases and deaths has been broken. Three people were killed in a fire that broke out at a Russian hospital treating patients with Covid-19, authorities said, with one official suggesting a faulty ventilator was to blame. The fire broke out in the early hours of Wednesday at a hospital in the city of Ryazan, 180 kilometres (112 miles) from Moscow, in a ward treating Covid-19 patients. The region’s governor, Nikolai Lyubimov, told state television that a ventilator in the ward had overheated and caught fire, the Interfax news agency reported. Nurses attempted to extinguish the blaze, but were unsuccessful in doing so, with some of them sustaining severe burns, the governor said. Reuters note that since the start of the pandemic, Russia has reported several fires at intensive care units that doctors said were caused by malfunctioning ventilators used to treat patients severely ill with the virus. Andrew Sparrow has begun publishing our UK live blog for the day. I suspect there will be a lot of politics in it today. I’ll continue to have top UK lines as well as the global Covid news. Russia has reported 10,407 new coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours, its highest number of daily infections since early March, taking the national tally to 5,156,250 since the pandemic began. Regular readers will note that I’ve expressed some scepticism about how Russia’s official figures basically haven’t moved for months, which doesn’t feel like how the pandemic has behaved elsewhere. Reuters said the government coronavirus task force reported 399 people had died, pushing the national death toll to 124,895. The federal statistics agency has kept a separate toll and has said that Russia recorded around 270,000 deaths related to Covid-19 between April 2020 and April 2021. Gerald Imray reports for Associated Press from Cape Town that in South Africa, which has Africa’s most robust economy and its biggest coronavirus caseload, just 0.8% of the population is fully vaccinated. Hundreds of thousands of the country’s health workers, many of whom come face-to-face with the virus every day, are still waiting for their shots. The picture is similar with other African nations. In Nigeria, Africa’s biggest country with more than 200 million people, only 0.1% are fully protected. Kenya, with 50 million people, is even lower. Uganda has recalled doses from rural areas because it doesn’t have nearly enough to fight outbreaks in big cities. Chad didn’t administer its first vaccine shots until this past weekend. And there are at least five other countries in Africa where not one dose has been put into an arm, according to the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The World Health Organization says the continent of 1.3 billion people is facing a severe shortage of vaccine at the same time a new wave of infections is rising across Africa. Vaccine shipments into Africa have ground to a “near halt”, WHO said last week. In an interview, Nkengasong called on the leaders of wealthy nations meeting this week at the G7 summit to share spare vaccines – something the US has already agreed to do – and avert a “moral catastrophe”. “I’d like to believe that the G7 countries, most of them having kept excess doses of vaccines, want to be on the right side of history,” Nkengasong said. “Distribute those vaccines. We need to actually see these vaccines, not just … promises and goodwill.” Others are not so patient, nor so diplomatic. “People are dying. Time is against us. This IS INSANE,” South African human rights lawyer Fatima Hasan, an activist for equal access to health care, wrote in a series of text messages. NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson has told Times Radio this morning that vaccines appear to have “broken” the link between infections, hospital admission and deaths in the UK, and hospitals were reporting less sick, younger patients than before. He added: “And if, and it is a big if, if Bolton has gone through its complete cycle and if others areas follow Bolton, the view from the hospital there was that they were able to cope with the level of infections. “It’s important not to just focus on the raw numbers here … you also do need to look at who’s being admitted into hospital and how clinically vulnerable and what level of acuity they’ve got. “What chief executives are consistently telling us is that it is a much younger population that is coming in, they are less clinically vulnerable, they are less in need of critical care and therefore they’re seeing what they believe is significantly lower mortality rate which is, you know, borne out by the figures. So it’s not just the numbers of people who are coming in, it’s actually the level of harm and clinical risk.” However, PA Media reports he said those people who are admitted but survive may still end up with long Covid. Taiwan has reported 274 new local cases of Covid-19 today, mostly in New Taipei city. Another 25 people have died, bringing Taiwan’s total death toll to 296. Health authorities have just given their daily update, and the numbers are higher than the previous two days but lower than last week. There are currently 2,542 people in hospital and 1,486 with milder cases in centralised quarantine facilities. More than 10% of deaths – which have skewed older in this outbreak – occurred before the patient got to hospital, Testing capacity has also increased, with the ability for 48,000 PCR tests a day, up from 27,600. Health and welfare minister Chen Shih-chung has also reminded local governments that they should be following the protocols established under alert level 3, which limits gatherings and closes some shops, but doesn’t lock people inside. He made the comments in response to reports of the Miaoli county government ordering migrant workers be kept to their dorms and not allowed out except to go to work. A growing cluster of hundreds of cases across four factories is quickly becoming the new focus of this outbreak, and there are a lot of allegations around that migrant workers – of whom there are around 430,000 in the manufacturing industry primarily living in dormitories – are being treated at a different standard to Taiwanese employees. There is some pushback on the government’s handling of this outbreak, including its preparations for the known risk of outbreaks in migrant worker dorms, and over the level 3 rules for the general public. Employers are still only encouraged to facilitate working from home, and there are wide reports that many are still making workers go in - even if not strictly necessary. Meanwhile outdoor areas are closed. Dr David Nabarro, special envoy on Covid-19 for the World Health Organization, has said British prime minister Boris Johnson’s commitment to vaccinating the entire world by the end of next year could be a “gift for generations to come”. “I am absolutely delighted that the British prime minister has made this call to action for the world to get vaccinated by the end of next year,” he told Sky News.“And he’s going to use his leadership of the G7 group of nations to make this point. “So I think like many, I am hoping that world leaders in the G7 will just say very clearly: ‘We are going to work together to make sure that the world is vaccinated adequately by the end of 2022’. That would be a gift for generations to come. And it’s the kind of leadership that really we’re expecting and hoping to see in the coming weeks.” He added: “The reality is that it will be a massive undertaking to ensure that everybody has access to a vaccine, it will be a massive undertaking to make sure that enough vaccine is available and the vaccines are constantly modified in the light of new variants emerging. But this is doable. “It’s not in the big scheme of things a massive expenditure, it just requires everybody saying we’re going to work together on this job.” Nabarro may have over-estimated not only the extent to which Boris Johnson habitually sees his grand projects through to the end – garden bridge anyone? – but also under-estimated practicalities of it. Yesterday my colleague Sarah Boseley assessed how feasible it might be… The mayor of Greater Manchester in England, Andy Burnham, has offered a rare bit of praise to the government for “surging support” into areas where there are high case numbers after health secretary Matt Hancock announced that a “strengthened package of support” will be provided for Greater Manchester and Lancashire. “We very much appreciate the help of the government. It’s a reversal of where we were last year,” he said on BBC Breakfast. “Then we were getting restrictions put on us without support. This is an approach where the restrictions are being managed nationally through the road map. We’ve been working closely with the government on this. It’s a sensible approach and we support it.” Burnham has encouraged residents in parts of Lancashire and Greater Manchester to “minimise” the number of people they watch England’s Euro 2020 match against Croatia with this weekend after a rise in coronavirus cases in the areas. PA report he said: “If you look to this weekend with the weather looking good in Greater Manchester, which is great for everybody with the football coming, we would say minimise the number of people you watch the match with. Watch it outside if you can.” Burnham has also been on the Radio 4 Today programme, where he is been making the point that surge vaccinations could provide a key route out of the local restrictions that areas of the north-west of England are being asked to follow. There’s already been some pushback on that investigation by the CMA into the refund policies of British Airways and Ryanair, as you might imagine. PA Media is reporting that a spokeswoman for British Airways said the company has issued more than 3m refunds. They added: “We continue to offer highly flexible booking policies at the same time as operating a vastly reduced schedule due to government-imposed travel restrictions, and we have acted lawfully at all times. “It is incredible that the government is seeking to punish further an industry that is on its knees, after prohibiting airlines from meaningful flying for well over a year now. “Any action taken against our industry will only serve to destabilise it, with potential consequences for jobs, business, connectivity and the UK economy.” The UK’s competition watchdog has launched action against British Airways and Ryanair over their refusal to give refunds to people during UK lockdowns, when they were “lawfully unable to fly” due to travel bans and restrictions imposed by the government. BA offered vouchers or rebooking and Ryanair only the option to rebook. The Competition and Markets Authority started an investigation in December. It said this morning it is “concerned that, by failing to offer people their money back, both firms may have breached consumer law and left people unfairly out of pocket. It is now seeking to resolve these concerns with the companies, which may include seeking refunds, or other redress, for affected customers”. This relates to “periods when it was unlawful in one or more parts of the UK for people to travel for non-essential reasons. It covers flights that were not cancelled, and does not cover any other situations”. Andrea Coscelli, the chief executive of the CMA, said: While we understand that airlines have had a tough time during the pandemic, people should not be left unfairly out of pocket for following the law. Customers booked these flights in good faith and were legally unable to take them due to circumstances entirely outside of their control. We believe these people should have been offered their money back. My colleague Julia Kollewe will have more on this as it unfolds on our business live blog: UK’s CMA launches action against BA and Ryanair over refunds – business live UK government ministers could not justify spending millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money hiring consultants to assess applicants for its £500m Covid emergency support package for charities, despite clear bid processes already existing, according to cross-party MPs. Ministers were also unable to explain why a team of political special advisers was given an unusually central role in deciding which charities would receive funding, or why some charities received cash even though their bids initially received low scores. The public accounts committee (PAC) said there was a “notable opaqueness” surrounding decisions on how funds were distributed to charities, with little clarity about how the cash was shared regionally, or what impact it had. MPs were examining the £513m allocated to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) last year to provide financial support for charities to help them meet increased demand during the pandemic. An additional £200m went to hospice charities via the Department of Health and Social Care. The PAC chair, Meg Hillier, said that it was not the first time during the pandemic “worrying smoke” had been thrown up by ministers around Covid support funding decisions, with “growing instances of the official processes overridden without adequate explanations”. “Exorbitant funds” having been spent by consultants without the impact being measured was a recurring pandemic theme, she added. “I fear one clear impact is the steady erosion of taxpayers’ trust that their money is being well spent in this national emergency.” Read more of Patrick Butler’s report here: Millions spent on consultants for Covid scheme ‘not justified’, MPs say The UK’s housing secretary Robert Jenrick is on media duties this morning, and he has said that coronavirus cases are “clearly rising” and that the government is reviewing a range of data to make a decision on the further lifting of restrictions on 21 June. PA Media reports he told Sky News: “The prime minister is reviewing the data, and more data is coming in, which is very important. We created this five-week period between the stages of the road map and that has actually proved invaluable on this occasion, because it’s a finely balanced decision. “We need to see that data of cases, which are clearly rising, but the link to hospitalisations and ultimately to death. So the prime minister is reviewing that ahead of the decision point, which is going to be 14 June – at that point of course he will let everybody know what the ultimate decision is.” He was pressed particularly on the impact on wedding planning, and the current uncertainty over how many people will be able to attend ceremonies during July. The cap on 30 attendees was one of the restrictions the UK government roadmap touted being lifted “no earlier” than 21 June. Jenrick said: We’ve always said that the roadmap is subject to review of the data, and that is what is happening right now. So whether it’s weddings, or international travel, or any of these other important topics, you always have to wait until the judgment is made on the basis of the data. I wouldn’t make plans until you’ve heard from the PM, if that’s important to you, but weddings can go ahead right now but just with the maximum 30 guests. Mongolia is the latest country to begin holding an election where Covid restrictions are in place for voting, and where the handling of the pandemic is going to be a major factor in swaying the vote. The winner will become the sixth president he vast landlocked nation of 3 million people since the peaceful transition from communism to democracy in 1992. Incumbent Battulga Khaltmaa of the Democratic party is barred by the constitution from seeking a second six-year term. Voters are required to observe social distancing, and restrictions on public gatherings have severely curtailed campaign events, prompting candidates to shift much of their outreach to voters online. Mongolia’s already ailing economy has been thrown into crisis due to the pandemic, with 69,022 cases and 324 deaths reported and the number of new local infections hitting a daily record last week. That has forced the temporary closure of markets and other enterprises in the capital of Ulaanbaatar. Pandemic-related disruptions in demand for Mongolia’s chief exports such as coal and copper are also dragging on the economy. Doctors, pharmacists and workplaces in Australia can now incentivise people to receive the Covid-19 vaccine by offering rewards including cash, prizes and complementary and alternative medicines, in a move a professor of public health and expert on drugs regulation, Prof Ken Harvey, has described as “utter craziness”. Since Covid-19 vaccines became available in Australia from February, some doctors have expressed frustration that strict rules around the promotion and advertising of medicines enforced by drugs regulator the Therapeutic Goods Administration has meant they could not promote the vaccines as freely as they would have liked, including directly to patients during consults, or on social media. The regulations are important because they prevent drugs companies and health professionals from making exaggerated claims about medicines and medical devices, and stop drug companies from advertising prescription drugs directly to consumers including through television, radio and social media. But the regulations have also made vaccine promotion difficult during the pandemic. In response, the TGA amended the rules, though only for the promotion of Covid-19 vaccines. While health professionals, corporate entities and media outlets can now communicate information publicly about TGA-approved Covid-19 vaccines, this information must be consistent with current commonwealth health messaging. Any promotion must not reference brand names such as Pfizer or AstraZeneca or any active ingredients that might identify the vaccines. The rules do not allow any statements saying vaccines do not cause harm, or any false or misleading information. Read more of Melissa Davey’s report here: Covid vaccine incentives – Australian doctors now allowed to offer cash, prizes and alternative medicines Also worth noting, the UK has not been included in a mass update of international travel warnings from the US State Department mentioned earlier [see 6.46am]. PA Media notes that the department has changed its advice for dozens of nations, including France, Spain and Italy, from “Level 4: Do Not Travel” to “Level 3: Reconsider Travel”, according to its website. The UK has been designated Level 3 since May 10. The Level 3 advice allows travel for fully vaccinated citizens, with a warning they should “avoid travel due to serious risks to safety and security”. However, the UK is still subject to a presidential decree which prohibits non-US citizens who have been in the UK in the last 14 days from entering the country. The full list can be found on the state department website here: US state department travel advisories Overnight PA’s Joe Gammie has rounded-up some more response from the travel industry on the traffic-light system being used for international travel in England – and it is not a warm welcome for it. London-based World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) said the Government must scrap the system which has “wreaked havoc” among consumers and businesses in order to save hundreds of thousands of jobs. Portugal being moved from the green to amber caught many holidaymakers by surprise and left thousands of UK tourists scrambling to get home before new quarantine rules came into force on Tuesday morning. The WTTC said that moving to a more transparent and easier to understand system will restore consumer confidence and provide a “much-needed” boost to the travel and tourism sector. It warned that a further 218,000 jobs were at “serious risk” if international travel continued to be off limits for most of the summer, on top of the 307,000 jobs which were lost in the UK sector last year. WTTC acting CEO Virginia Messina said: “It’s time the Government abandoned the hugely damaging traffic lights system. Consumers, airlines and the wider travel sector were promised a watchlist and three weeks’ notice of any changes from green to amber, and not just four days. “It has been incredibly disruptive and costly for both travel and tourism businesses and consumers. It simply hasn’t worked. What’s needed now is a watertight government policy enabling those who’ve been fully jabbed to travel freely, and not have to self-isolate on their return. “Those who are not fully vaccinated should be able to travel with proof of a negative test, like what we are seeing in the EU. The travel sector needs this now if it is to survive this summer as domestic travel alone will not save the day.” It is already clear what one of the main topics of the UK’s morning media round is going to be: presenters trying to trip up ministers over Andrew Lloyd-Webber’s claim that he was going to reopen his theatres come-what-may and is willing to be arrested over it. The composer said he may have to sell his six West End venues if the government does not remove restrictions that have forced venues to run with reduced capacities. Lloyd Webber is preparing for a production of Cinderella, which is scheduled to open for previews on 25 June ahead of its world premiere in July. “We are going to open, come hell or high water,” Lord Lloyd-Webber told the Telegraph. Asked what he would do if the government postponed lifting lockdown, he said: “We will say: ‘come to the theatre and arrest us.”’ On Sky News, Kay Burley has already been repeatedly pressing housing minister Robert Jenrick on whether Lloyd-Webber should be arrested. For a government that indulged Dominic Cumming’s trip to Durham last year, it is always tricky for a minister to flat-out state that someone should just obey the rules. I’m not sure this is the most enlightening way to tease out current government thinking on whether there will be a delay to England’s planned 21 June reopening. It may well feel like a very long morning of interviews for Jenrick. Confidence in the EU’s ability to handle crises has taken a hit from Covid-19, a major survey shows, but dissatisfaction with national political systems is even higher and most people still support EU membership and want a stronger, more cooperative bloc. The report’s authors suggested the polling should be a wake-up call for Brussels, warning that while public support for the broader European project remained high in many countries, it was fragile and would not easily survive more disappointment. Europeans were “making a distinction between the need for cooperation and solidarity at a European level, and their confidence in the EU to deliver”, they said, and were unhappy the bloc had “missed an opportunity to prove its worth”. The polling also suggested Brexit had changed Europeans’ views of the UK, with the prevailing view now seeing Britain – like the US – as a “necessary partner” to be “strategically cooperated with” rather than an ally, and one in four Germans and one in five French and Spanish respondents considering it as a rival or adversary. The report, published by the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR) on Wednesday, suggested the bloc’s poor early response to the pandemic and slow initial vaccine rollout had dealt a heavy blow to confidence in its capabilities. Read Jon Henley’s full report here: Europeans’ confidence in EU hit by coronavirus response Chinese authorities in Guangdong have taken extraordinary measures to make sure students have been able to sit the crucial gaokao college entrance exams amid an outbreak in the city of Guangzhou. From AFP: The local government has dispatched hundreds of taxis and buses to ferry students from neighbourhoods affected by the outbreak to exam venues, with state broadcaster CCTV showing footage of drivers in hazmat suits spraying down their cars. Students were split into different rooms based on their level of Covid-19 risk, with contacts of confirmed cases taking the tests in smaller groups. But infected students with mild symptoms had to take the tough exams solo in brightly lit isolation rooms in the hospital or special locations. CCTV footage showed one student sitting at a lone desk and scratching his head as he read the exam paper, a bottle of hand sanitizer on the desk and officials monitoring him on a TV screen. Other state footage showed masked examiners in protective clothing removing completed exam papers from infected students and hanging them up on a clothes-drying rack to be sprayed down with disinfectant. Provincial officials inspected testing sites in Guangzhou late last week and urged examiners to make sure “students feel comfortable, parents are at ease and society is reassured,” the local government said. Last year’s gaokao exams were delayed as schools hesitated to resume mass activities due to the coronavirus, which first emerged in the country in late 2019. Life in China has since returned almost to normal, with authorities responding to sporadic outbreaks with aggressive testing and localised quarantines. Guangzhou authorities shut down cinemas and karaoke bars across the city on Tuesday, and have locked down neighbourhoods and ordered travellers leaving the city to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test. China reported eight locally transmitted Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, all of which were detected in Guangdong province. Reuters: The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has eased travel recommendations for more than 110 countries and territories, including Japan just ahead of the Olympics. The Biden administration is forming expert working groups with Canada, Mexico, the European Union and Britain to determine how best to safely restart travel after 15 months of pandemic restrictions, a White House official said on Tuesday. The CDC’s new ratings include 61 nations that were lowered from its highest “level 4” rating that discouraged all travel to recommending travel for fully vaccinated individuals, the agency confirmed on Tuesday. An additional 50 countries and territories have been lowered to “level 2” or “level 1,” a CDC spokeswoman said. Countries ranked lowest for Covid-19 risks now include Singapore, Israel, South Korea, Iceland, Belize and Albania. Among those now listed at “level 3,” are France, Ecuador, the Philippines, South Africa, Canada, Mexico, Russia, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, Honduras, Hungary and Italy. A US pharmacist has been jailed for three years after pleading guilty to trying to spoil hundreds of doses of the Moderna vaccine because he was skeptical about them. The US justice department said on Tuesday the 46-year-old man had also been ordered to pay $83,800 in compensation to the hospital at which he worked. According to a statement from the Wisconsin eastern district’s US Attorney’s office, he pleaded guilty to two counts of attempting to tamper with consumer products with reckless disregard for the risk that another person would be placed in danger of death or bodily injury. According to justice department, in December 2020 the man deliberately removed a box of vaccine vials from a hospital refrigeration unit on two successive night shift. Moderna’s vaccine has to be stored and shipped frozen but can be stored for 30 days in standard-temperature refrigerators. The statement said the man was generally skeptical of vaccines, and the Moderna vaccine specifically. It said he had shared his beliefs with co-workers for at least the past two years. Intensive care beds for Covid patients in Malaysia have reached full capacity, according to the country’s health director general, who said the country’s pandemic remained at a critical level. Malaysia entered a near total lockdown on 1 June, after daily cases rose to more than 9,000 last month. The increase in cases has been blamed on the more infectious variants of the virus, as well as gatherings held ahead of Eid al-Fitr. Malaysia’s health director general, Noor Hisham Abdullah, said hospitals were facing a rise in severe cases of Covid, especially among older and clinically vulnerable people, who needed oxygen and respiratory assistance. “These patients need a long recovery period to heal, due to serious complications from Covid-19,” he said. The pressure placed on intensive care units, which are at 100% capacity, was very worrying, Noor Hisham said, adding some patients who needed critical care could not be placed in an ICU bed. While new infections have fallen slightly over the past two weeks, there were still 82,797 active cases under treatment and observation as of 8 June. Malaysia managed to contain the virus for much of 2020, and had recorded fewer than 500 fatalities by January. The country’s death toll has since risen to 3,536, while 627,652 cases have been recorded. Hospital morgues have been forced to use containers to cope with the rise in fatalities. Malaysia imposed a national lockdown on 1 June, shutting schools and shopping malls. Only two people from each household are allowed to go out to buy essentials or seek medical treatment within 10km of their home. The manufacturing sector, however, has been allowed to continue operating at a reduced capacity. Malaysia began its vaccination campaign in February, and 7.7% of the population has since received at least one dose Hello and welcome to the continuing coverage of the global pandemic. Here are some of the major developments in the last day. Guangzhou city in China has ordered the closures of cinemas, theatres, nightclubs and other indoor entertainment venues amid an outbreak. The US and the European Union are expected to support a renewed push into investigating the origins of Covid-19 after conflicting assessments about where the outbreak started, according to Bloomberg News. Residents of Melbourne in Australia will come out a tough lockdown on Thursday night, but will still be subject to restrictions including 25km travel limits Washington is also forming working parties with Brussels, Canada, and Mexico to determine how best to safely restart international travel. It came as the World Travel and Tourism Council said the UK government had to scrap its traffic light system for travel because it had “wreaked havoc”. Portugal will allow vaccinated US tourists into the country, Reuters reports. “We are in a position to approve the opening of non-essential travel and flights to people from the US to Portugal as long as they have a vaccination certificate,” economy minister Pedro Siza Vieira, cited by Portuguese radio Renascenca, said. Vaccine passports will be used for the first time at UK sporting events for England’s Euro 2020 group games at Wembley stadium, with those not fully vaccinated able to show proof of a negative lateral flow test taken within the previous 48 hours. World Bank president David Malpass said the institution does not support waiving intellectual property rights for Covid-19 vaccines at the World Trade Organization, claiming it is out of concern that it would hamper innovation in the pharmaceuticals sector. South Africa’s president Cyril Ramaphosa placed the country’s health minister on “special leave” over alleged links to a corruption scandal involving coronavirus communications funding. Pfizer is to begin testing its Covid-19 vaccine on a larger cohort of thousands of children under 12 years old in the US, Finland, Poland and Spain after selecting a lower dose of the shot in an earlier stage of the trial. A top White House official has urged state governors to work with the US Food and Drug Administration to extend the shelf life of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s Covid vaccine as millions of unused doses nationwide near expiration. Many thousands of vaccine doses have been destroyed in African countries after exceeding their expiry dates amid a reluctance to be inoculated and a lack of medical infrastructure, while some jabs were donated relatively late in their shelf life. Music fans flocked to the first unrestricted European festival since the pandemic began over the weekend at an event in Albania that had 10,000 attendees across four days, with everyone showing proof of a recent negative test. Washington state is to give adults a free cannabis spliff after they receive a Covid jab in an attempt to accelerate vaccination uptake through a promotion coined “Joints for Jabs” by the state’s liquor and cannabis board.","charCount":"43227","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/kaamil-ahmed\">Kaamil Ahmed</a> (now); <a href=\"profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a> and <a href=\"profile/helen-davidson\">Helen Davidson</a> (earlier)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/live/2021/jun/09/brexit-northern-ireland-eu-trade-coronavirus-covid-uk-live-latest-news-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-09T11:47:50Z","webTitle":"PMQs: Boris Johnson faces questions from Keir Starmer – politics live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2021/jun/09/brexit-northern-ireland-eu-trade-coronavirus-covid-uk-live-latest-news-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/live/2021/jun/09/brexit-northern-ireland-eu-trade-coronavirus-covid-uk-live-latest-news-updates","fields":{"headline":"PMQs: Boris Johnson faces questions from Keir Starmer – politics live","standfirst":"<p>Latest updates: prime minister faces questions in Commons from Labour leader</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/08/tensions-rise-over-eu-trade-row-with-uk-over-sausage-sales\">Trade war threats will not wash with voters, Frost tells EU</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/09/covid-contract-for-firm-run-by-cummings-friends-was-unlawful-judge-rules\">Covid contract for firm run by Cummings’ friends unlawful, judge rules</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jun/09/brexit-what-is-the-northern-ireland-row-about\">Brexit: what is the Northern Ireland row about?</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/jun/09/australian-government-prepared-to-walk-away-from-uk-free-trade-deal-over-agricultural-access\">Australia prepared to walk away from UK free trade deal</a><br></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus – latest global updates</a><br></li></ul>","trailText":"Latest updates: prime minister faces questions in Commons from Labour leader","byline":"Andrew Sparrow","main":"<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a2b8a59b-ab16-4373-ac7e-c573d41a5635\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1nzCnwJYZgY?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>","body":"<div id=\"block-60c0a9bc8f08895fbfa9ff9e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-09T11:47:04.552Z\">12.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Lord Frost</strong>, the Brexit minister, has issued this statement following his talks this morning with the EU over the Northern Ireland protocol.

He said: The problem we’ve got is the protocol is being implemented in a way which is causing disruption in Northern Ireland and we had some pretty frank and honest discussions about that situation today ... There weren’t any breakthroughs. There aren’t any breakdowns either and we’re going to carry on talking. What we really now need to do is very urgently find some solutions which support the Belfast Good Friday agreement, support the peace process in Northern Ireland and allow things to return to normal. Maroš Šefčovič, Frost’s EU counterpart, is due to give his own assessment at a press conference starting at 1pm. Jacob Young (Con) asks about investment in Redcar. Will the PM visit it to see its plans for levelling up? Johnson says Young is a fantastic advocate for the town. He says when he can he will visit the town for a lemon top. And that’s it. PMQs is over. Emma Lewell-Buck (Lab) says her local hospital if facing cuts. Will the PM intervene to help? Johnson says the changes referred to be Lewell-Buck are being consulted on. He says the plans are about improving services, not downgrading anything. Claire Coutinho (Con) asks if the PM will consider the powers available to the traffic commissioner to consider the impact of HGV lorries. Johnson says he will look at this. Jonathan Edwards (Plaid Cymru) says Brexit has been a tale of betrayals. Will the steel industry be next to be betrayed? Johnson says no. He says Brexit offers opportunities for Welsh farmers to export. They will be able to do brilliantly, he says. Ian Lavery (Lab) says the north-east of England has suffered particularly badly in terms of lost learning for pupils. The government’s catch-up plans are “derisory”, he says. Parents are listening; will the PM use his privileged education background to explain how 20p a day helps kids catch up? Johnson says Lavery is wrong; the sums are huge, he says. He repeats the point about the tuition programme being the biggest in the world. Sir David Amess (Con) says the hurt felt by women who had to give up children for adoption in the 50s, 60s and 70s is still felt today. Does the PM agree they deserve an apology? Johnson agrees. He says the practices that led to forced adoption cannot now occur. He says the agencies involved in forced adoption in the past “have apologise for their role, and quite right too”. Theresa May, the former Conservative PM, asks if the PM will urgently consider the implications of the collapse of the latest Hillsborough prosecution and if he will consider if the law needs to be changed? Johnson says the government will look at this case and consider opportunities to change the law. Andrew Gwynne (Lab) says the PM has seen his ministerial standards adviser resign, his top legal adviser resign, and his education recovery adviser resign. Why does this keep happening? Johnson says he is grateful to everyone who has worked for him. David Jones (Con) says Lord Frost is doing a superb job. Does the PM agree that the Northern Ireland protocol is unsustainable as currently applied? Should the EU adopt a more pragmatic approach? Johnson says he agrees completely. He says Frost is the greatest Frost since the Great Frost of 1709. Brendan Clarke-Smith (Con) asks when councils can take back control over trespassing. Johnson says the police, crime, sentencing and courts bill contains measures to address this. He says Labour voted against it. Barry Sheerman (Lab) asks when levelling up will start. He says the PM has led a life of privilege. How will the government know it is succeeding? When will we see the evidence of this? Johnson says the government has a £640bn investment programme that, bit by bit, will transform people’s opportunity. He says his government believes talent is fairly distributed, but not opportunity. That is the difference with Labour, he claims. Colum Eastwood, the SDLP leader, asks why the PM is prioritising a deal that will benefit Australian farmers instead of agreeing to align food standards with the EU’s, which would help trade with Northern Ireland. Johnson says he wants to protect the economic and territorial integrity of the UK. Scott Benton (Con) asks the PM to ensure there is a wider plan to ensure no child loses out as a result of the pandemic. Johnson says the tutoring plan is evidence-based. And the government may increase time spend in schools. He says Labour should use their influence with teaching unions to get teachers to agree. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, says the PM will be the only leader at the G7 summit cutting aid to the poorest. He says the PM has been hiding on this issue for months. This is an government on the run, he says. Will the PM commit to a vote on the aid cuts, as demanded by the Speaker? Yes or no? Johnson says we are in very, very difficult financial times. He says Blackford should not believe “lefty propaganda”. The UK is spending £10bn on aid, he says. And £500m is being spent on girls’ education. Blackford says he has never heard Theresa May (who opposes the aid cuts) described as a leftist propagandist. He says now is the time to support one another. The PM is slashing £4.5bn from the world’s poorest. Johnson says that question was disgraceful. He says the government has contributed £1.6bn to the Gavi vaccination programme. And he repeats the point about one in three vaccines being AZ ones. Felicity Buchan (Con) asks if the government will build back better in a way that works for the whole country. Johnson says he will. Starmer says this would be more convincing if the UK was not cutting its aid budget. He asks about the Middle East peace process. It is urgent to restart it, he says. A Palestinian state seems more distant than ever. Will the PM push for a settlement, and for the end to illegal settlements? Johnson says it is common ground in the Commons that the solution is a two-state outcome. He says he has made that clear. He says Starmer is wrong to accuse the government of not being ambitious in international aid. The government is spending more than Labour ever did, he says. He says the British people know that that is the right priority for this country. And if Labour want a vote, the people had a vote on this last month. And they voted firmly in favour of the government. Starmer says Johnson cannot claim to be on the side of deprived kids if he does not support the Collins plan. “Come off it.” Turning to the G7, he says the UK must lead, and not just host. There must be a clear plan to vaccinate the world. Will the PM take the lead and do whatever is necessary to make global vaccinations a reality? Yes, says Johnson. He says the UK was one of the first countries to authorise the AstraZeneca vaccine. And one in three vaccine doses distributed around the world are AZ. That is global Britain in action. Starmer says Johnson was told if he did not back the Collins plan, the attainment gap would increase by between 10% and 24%. He asks which parts of the Labour plan the PM objects to. Johnson tells the Speaker he is entitled to draw attention to what Labour said at the last election. He says if Labour is now supporting his plan, that is a good thing. Starmer says this is a false economy. If the government does not change course, it will hold Britain back for a generation. Will the government back the Labour motion on this being put to a vote later? Johnson says Labour opposed academies and higher standards. Labour even wanted to get rid of Ofsted at the last election, he says. He claims his reforms are serious and based on evidence. Sir Lindsay Hoyle says this is PMQs, and not about the agenda at the last election. Starmer says Collins came up with a plan, but the Treasury only offered one tenth of what was needed. “So much for levelling up.” The funding is about £50 per child per year. Even with all the funding, for England it is only worth £310 over four years. But in the US they are spending £1,600 per pupil, and in the Netherlands £2,500 per pupil. Johnson says this is £3bn just for starters. And it includes the biggest programme of one-to-one tutorials anywhere in the world. He says private school children are getting personal tuition. He says he wants other children to benefit too. Sir Keir Starmer starts by offering the PM “warm congratulations” on his marriage. He asks why the PM thinks Sir Kevan Collins, his former education recovery adviser, described the government’s plan for catch-up learning as half-hearted and inadequate. Johnson says this will be the biggest tutoring programme in the world, based on the best evidence Collins could supply. Ben Bradley (Con) asks for a meeting with the PM to discuss options for the east Midlands. Johnson says Bradley already has a ministerial meeting lined up. Gavin Newlands (SNP) asks what the government is doing to stop “fire and rehire” policies. The government is not protecting workers, he says. Johnson says the government has been clear that using threats of firing and rehiring as a negotiating tactic is unacceptable. It can only be used in limited circumstances, such as to reduce job losses, he says. Boris Johnson starts by saying he is delighted to be hosting the G7 summit this week. It is the first (in person) meeting of G7 leaders since the pandemic started, he says. Gavin Barwell, Theresa May’s former chief of staff, has responded to what Patrick O’Flynn said earlier about his criticism of the government’s stance on the Northern Ireland protocol. (See 10.30am.) PMQs is about to start. Here is the list of MPs down to ask a question. Priti Patel, the home secretary, has been addressing the Police Federation conference. She started her speech by telling officers that she saw her role as being their advocate in government. She said: Nothing gives me greater pride than the work that I’ve been able to do with men and women in policing who do an extraordinary job under increasingly extraordinary circumstances. And nothing has a stronger effect on me than talking to the families of police officers who’ve been killed in the line of duty. John [Apter, the Police Federation chair] and I have a shared duty, being an advocate for police, and I’m your political advocate in Westminster. It’s my job to make sure that you have what you need to do your job. Loyalists in Northern Ireland view Brexit’s Irish Sea trade border as a manifestation of attacks on their British identity, MPs have been told. As PA Media reports, Billy Hutchinson, the Progressive Unionist party (PUP) leader, told a Westminster committee the only way to resolve issues around the Northern Ireland protocol was through political means. PA says: However, Hutchinson warned that loyalist leaders had a “very difficult” job convincing some people within their community that protests should remain peaceful, claiming the reason the trade border was not placed on the Irish land border was due to the threat of republican violence. The PUP has a long-established link with the loyalist paramilitary organisation the Ulster Volunteer Force. Hutchinson, a Belfast city councillor, told the Northern Ireland affairs committee that the European single market represented the biggest threat to his British identity. “People are angry, people misunderstood how Brexit was going to play out and people didn’t realise that Brexit would have a bigger impact in Northern Ireland than it would have in the rest of the UK,” he said. “So the protocol is a manifestation of people attacking their Britishness or taking something away.” Here is my colleague David Conn’s story on the high court ruling on the award of the contract to Public First being illegal. Adults living in the most deprived areas of England are three times more likely to be hesitant about getting a coronavirus vaccine than those in the least deprived parts, PA Media reports. PA says: One in 10 people in the most deprived parts reported vaccine hesitancy between 28 April and 23 May, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This compares with 3% of those in the least deprived areas. Overall, hesitancy levels in Britain are slightly down from the previous month, the survey of 15,173 adults aged 16 years and over found. Some 94% of adults in Britain reported positive sentiment, while 6% reported hesitancy, compared with 93% and 7% respectively between 31 March and 25 April. One in eight (13%) of those aged 16-29 reported hesitancy - the highest proportion of all the age groups and unchanged from the previous month. Black or black British adults were the ethnic group reporting the highest level of vaccine hesitancy, at 21%. Jolyon Maugham, head of the Good Law Project, says the high court has ruled that the Cabinet Office’s decision to award a public opinion research contract worth £560,000 to a company with Tory links without putting it out to tender was unlawful. The Good Law Project has written up the ruling here. And the 43-page judgment is here (pdf). And here is the conclusion from Mrs Justice O’Farrell. For the reasons set out above, the claimant’s challenge to the defendant’s decision to award a contract to Public First and the award of the contract fails on grounds 1 and 2 but succeeds on ground 3. The claimant is entitled to a declaration that the decision of 5 June 2020 to award the contract to Public First gave rise to apparent bias and was unlawful. Following hand down of this judgment, the hearing will be adjourned to a date to be fixed for the purpose of any consequential matters, including any applications for permission to appeal, and any time limits are extended until such hearing or further order. Boris Johnson has thanked police officers for their work during the pandemic in a surprise video address to the Police Federation conference this morning. Delivering what he said was a “huge thank you”, he said: You’ve encouraged people to stick to the rules the same time as you’ve been fighting crime and you’ve each risen to an enormous challenge. Just as I could never have imagined being forced, as prime minister, to close pubs and bars and restaurants or tell people how many households could get together, I bet that policing restrictions in that way was not something you ever dreamt you would be doing. But you did it because you knew it was how we were going to protect the NHS and save lives. Johnson also said that the government had recruited 8,771 new officers and that it was 44% of the way towards the target of 20,000 extra officers by 2023. Arlene Foster, the outgoing DUP first minister of Northern Ireland, does not seem to agree with Gavin Barwell’s analysis of who is to blame for the problems with the Northern Ireland protocol. (See 8.48am.) She has posted this response to a tweet from the former Ukip MEP Patrick O’Flynn. More than 80% of adults in England and Wales would test positive for Covid antibodies, according to figures released by the Office for National Statistics this morning. The figures are lower for Northern Ireland (79.9%) and for Scotland (72.6%). Having antibodies can protect people from further infection. People acquire antibodies either through vaccination, or from being infected in the past. But antibody levels do not correspond to the total number of people vaccinated and infected in the past because over time antibody levels reduce to the point where they are no longer detected in tests. Here are the figures for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. They cover the week beginning Monday 17 May, and they are based on the results of a survey that involves tens of thousands of people being tested at random. And these charts compare the proportion of adults testing positive for antibodies (the dark blue line) with the proportion who have had one dose of vaccine (the green line) and the proportion fully vaccinated (the light green line). Lord Frost and his EU counterpart Maroš Šefčovič, vice-president of the European Commission, have started their talks at Admiralty House in London. Although it essentially one event, technically there are two meetings taking place: a meeting of the withdrawal agreement joint committee meeting (the body set up to oversee the implementation of the withdrawal agreement, including the Northern Ireland protocol); and a meeting of the partnership council (the body set up to oversee the implementation of the UK-EU trade deal, the trade and cooperation agreement). Frost and Šefčovič jointly chair both bodies. Here is the agenda (pdf) for the withdrawal agreement joint committee meeting. And here is the agenda (pdf) for the partnership council meeting. In a statement issued last night, ahead of his meeting this morning with Maroš Šefčovič, Lord Frost, the Brexit minister, urged the EU to adopt “pragmatism” and “common sense solutions” to resolve the problems in Northern Ireland. He said: I hope this will be a productive forum where we can address shared challenges by working together in the spirit of mutual trust and cooperation. First among these challenges is the damaging impact the protocol is having on the ground in Northern Ireland. Businesses in Great Britain are choosing not to sell their goods into Northern Ireland because of burdensome paperwork, medicine manufacturers are threatening to cut vital supplies, and chilled meats from British farmers destined for the Northern Ireland market are at risk of being banned entirely ... Our overriding shared priority must be to protect the Belfast (Good Friday) agreement and the peace process. I look to the EU to show flexibility and engage with our proposals so that we can find solutions that enjoy the confidence of all communities. Further threats of legal action and trade retaliation from the EU won’t make life any easier for the shopper in Strabane who can’t buy their favourite product. Nor will it benefit the small business in Ballymena struggling to source produce from their supplier in Birmingham. What is needed is pragmatism and common sense solutions to resolve the issues as they are before us. This work is important. And it is ever more urgent. Good morning. Lord Frost, the Brexit minister, is holding talks this morning with his EU counterpart, Maroš Šefčovič, in an attempt to resolve the increasingly acrimonious dispute about the post-Brexit rules in place governing trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. These involve checks on some goods, and potentially some restrictions (including later this year on sausages and other chilled meats) to protect the EU single market, which includes Northern Ireland. The UK agreed to all these rules when it signed the Northern Ireland protocol. But now it is arguing that there is a need for a rethink because: a) the EU is being too “purist” in enforcing these rules; and b) the UK did not fully realise what the protocol would involve. Frost made this latter argument in an article for the Financial Times (paywall) at the weekend. He wrote: We expected to be able to operate it in a way which respected the sensitive politics in Northern Ireland — after all that was the point of making special arrangements in the first place ... We underestimated the effect of the protocol on goods movements to Northern Ireland, with some suppliers in Great Britain simply not sending their products because of the time-consuming paperwork required. This morning Gavin Barwell, who as Theresa May’s chief of staff was fully involved in the Brexit talks until the summer of 2019, said it was just not plausible for Boris Johnson to claim that he did not know what he was signing up to. Barwell told the Today programme: I don’t think the EU is ever going to think that is credible. The EU negotiating team have obviously worked very closely with the British negotiating team under both governments. They know the quality of the civil servants involved in that work, and they know that British ministers would have been have been advised in detail on the implications of what they were signing up to. So I don’t think anyone who’s involved in the process is going to find it credible that the government signed up to something and didn’t understand what the consequences of that were. Asked if he thought that the government was now only pretending that it did not realise how damaging the protocol would be when it signed it in 2019, Barwell said: It’s difficult to conceive of any other explanation. When I was working with Theresa [May], Boris Johnson was foreign secretary for a period of that time. He perfectly well understood what the previous iteration of the protocol meant in terms of regulatory checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. When the deal was published and the government brought its legislation forward, the explanatory memorandum for the bill, which explained what the bill meant, was very clear what the consequences would be. And I think he and David Frost are intelligent people. I find it inconceivable that they didn’t understand what they were signing up to. They would have been advised very clearly by the civil service about that. And I think it’s also important to consider the political context at the time. When Boris took over, he initially tried to prorogue parliament and leave without a deal. He wasn’t able to do that. So he then decided that he wanted to call an election to strengthen his position and it was clearly easier to fight that an election within an “oven-ready” Brexit deal. So I think the calculation was sign up to whatever is on offer, and then see if we can deal with anything we don’t like down the line. I think the EU have come to the same conclusion as me and that’s why they’re taking the approach that they are now. Barwell was expanding in his interview on a claim he made on Twitter on Monday. Yesterday Downing Street said Barwell’s analysis was wrong. Here is the agenda for the day. Morning: Lord Frost, the Brexit minister, and Maroš Šefčovič, his EU counterpart, co-chair a meeting of the partnership council and the withdrawal agreement joint committee, which will mostly focus on the Northern Ireland protocol. 9.30am: The ONS publishes new figures on vaccine hesitancy, and on antibody levels in the UK. 11.15am: Priti Patel, the home secretary, gives a speech to the Police Federation. 12pm: Boris Johnson faces Sir Keir Starmer at PMQs. 12.30pm: Šefčovič holds a press briefing after his meeting with Frost. After 12.30pm: MPs begin a debate on a Labour motion criticising the government’s plans to help pupils make up for the learning lost during the pandemic. It says “the current half-hearted approach risks failing hundreds of thousands of young people” and calls for a more ambitious plan. 1.30pm: Downing Street is expected to hold its daily lobby briefing.

Ranked 33 in the world, she looked every inch a top 10 player here, and definitely capable of winning her first grand slam title. </p> <p>Nerves of steel in the last game of the match. She started to go for her shots again, rather than let Gauff dictate the rallies as she has done the last three matches, and goes to 40-0 up. Three more match points down, Gauff can only hit wide and Krejcikova throws her hands in the air. Her face is more surprised than jubilant, but what a moment for the 25-year-old! Her first grand slam semi-final.

Things aren’t helped as Gauff clips one off the net to go 5-4 up and then hits an unforced error barely half-way up the net. Two set points for Gauff! Krejcikova responds, just as she has all set, two clean forehand winner just when she needed it! We’re back to 6-6 in the tiebreak!

She is often so desperate to play the Hollywood winner, which is so often is capable of hitting, but forgets to play the percentages, which of courses makes for much more entertaining tennis. Krejcikova is having issues with her ball toss, but battles back to 30-30. This feels like a microcosm of the first set. Gauff gets to set point, and despite two more ball tosses that nearly end up next to the corporate seats, Krejcikova somehow gets back to deuce. Again, Gauff gets to break point with a outrageous winner on the run, before Krejcikova saves her set with her first backhand winner of the match, landing just inside the line.

Coco Gauff kicks things off on Philippe-Chatrier against Barbora Krejcikova. At 17, she is the youngest grand slam quarter-finalist for 15 years, but you can’t help feeling that this is just another tiny milestone in what will surely be a remarkable career. </p> <p>Both players will be nervous, though. The unseeded Krejcikova beat Sloane Stephens to reach this stage but admitted afterwards that she nearly didn’t take the court in the fourth-round due to nerves. She is traditionally a doubles player, but this is the first time she has reached the last eight of a grand slam. </p> <p><em>“You know, half an hour before the match, I didn’t even want to step on the court, because I just felt really bad, and I had to lock myself in the physio room and I had to talk to my psychologist. I was actually crying. We talked about it a lot, and she told me, ‘If you can overcome this, what you feel right now, it’s going to be a huge win, and it doesn’t matter if you’re going to win on the court or lose on the court, because it’s going to be a personal win’.” I think after the first point things got a little bit better, a little bit easier. Then I broke her. I just felt like yeah, you know, I can play, I can actually play her. So I think I was just more stressed that I’m just not going to be good enough. I think that’s what happened.”</em></p> <p>We join the match with Gauff an break up at 3-0 in the first set. After a double fault on the first point of the match, Gauff has certainly come out of the traps with more authority. Perhaps with the above comments, that is not surprising. But perhaps Krejcikova will take her time to grow into the match. </p> <h2>Wednesday’s order of play</h2> <ul> <li>Coco Gauff v Barbora Krejcíkova</li> <li>Maria Sakkari v Iga Swiatek</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Diego Schwartzman v Rafael Nadal</li> <li>Novak Djokovic v Matteo Berrettini</li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-06-09T10:21:19.945Z\">at 11.21am BST</time></p>  </div>","wordcount":"2575","firstPublicationDate":"2021-06-09T09:23:42Z","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2021-06-09T11:46:18Z","liveBloggingNow":"true","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/p/hmxg5","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7a429dbfa9587c744379ae39316c889cfae40d7/0_118_3875_2325/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","isLive":"true","bodyText":"First set: Sakkari 2-2 Swiatek* (*denotes next server) Two break points down and Sakkari pulls out two pearling serves to force deuce. Sakkari has never been this far before at the French Open, and has also beaten her mother, Angeliki Kanellopoulou, in that regard, who reached the third round at Roland Garros in 1985 and 1987. Both players exchange clean winners on consecutive points, before Sakkari saves break point with a 112mph serve down the middle. It’s the second serve where the Greek is struggling, winning just 13% of her points, but she again serves a fast, first one down the T to secure a crucial hold after facing four break points. First set: Sakkari* 1-2 Swiatek (*denotes next server) Sakkari breaks straight back! Have to say that it’s been a poor start to the match, quality wise. Both are missing their mark, rather than hitting clean winners. Swiatek is normally so consistent, last year she became the first woman since Justine Henin in 2007 to win Roland Garros without dropping a set. First set: Sakkari 0-2 Swiatek* (*denotes next server) Sakkari looks really nervous and can’t seem to string together any sort of rally. Swiatek, in contrast, looks set. She looks so comfortable on clay and doesn’t mind coming to the net. It’s an easy break for the defending champion. First set: Sakkari* 0-1 Swiatek (*denotes next server) A few looseners in that first game, especially from Sakkari, who shunted a couple long and wide. In the end, an easy hold for the defending champion. These two are good mates and trained together prior to this tournament. Swiatek also hit with Nadal before Roland Garros, which can’t of harmed. Sakkari should not be underestimated though, she’s a powerful player that doesn’t mind going for her shots. There are 5,000 people inside Chatrier today, and 13,000 throughout the grounds. Sakkari elects to receive, so Swiatek will serve first. It’s around 27 degs on court in Paris, beautiful conditions, just as it is outside my London flat right now. Nobody has lost fewer games than Iga Swiatek going into this match, The defending champion remains the only grand slam winner left in the women’s singles draw. The eight seed is surely the favourite against Maria Sakkari, despite being just 20 years old. Let’s recap on last year’s triumph. For any young readers (or parents) out there … Next up on Chatrier: Maria Sakkari v Iga Swiatek. A reminder of what else we’ve got for you today later on in the men’s singles quarter-finals: Diego Schwartzman v Rafael Nadal Novak Djokovic v Matteo Berrettini I don’t realise what I have done. I just came here without a good start to a clay season. Now that I’m here in a semi-finals. I never imagined I would be here on this court, especially in singles. This is something that I never could have dreamed of. The first set was really important. Just I just wanted to enjoy it. I was always behind her a little bit but I made it somehow. The second set I was leading but then got a little bit tired. Coco is incredible. When I was 17, I was playing ITFs. She is amazing. I’m going to watch Maria Sakkari v Iga Swiatek. Right now I watch all the matches. I can’t wait to come back here tomorrow. I would play today if I could. Krejcikova deserves this. She looked shaky at the start, came through some break points in the first set when all looked lost, and has had the quality to despatch Gauff when she has been on top. Ranked 33 in the world, she looked every inch a top 10 player here, and definitely capable of winning her first grand slam title. Nerves of steel in the last game of the match. She started to go for her shots again, rather than let Gauff dictate the rallies as she has done the last three matches, and goes to 40-0 up. Three more match points down, Gauff can only hit wide and Krejcikova throws her hands in the air. Her face is more surprised than jubilant, but what a moment for the 25-year-old! Her first grand slam semi-final. A year ago, she was outside the top 100! Second set: Gauff 6-7 (6), 3-5 Krejcikova* (*denotes next server) Gauff goes to a 30-0 lead but Krejcikova pegs her back before edging a rally to take her to her fourth match point! Second serve, and Gauff bunts one up the T! The guts on this teenager! For all her poorness in this second set, the American can be clutch. A fifth match point for Krejcikova comes and goes, before Gauff closes out the game. Wow! Gauff is motoring! Can Krejcikova hold her nerve? Second set: Gauff* 6-7 (6), 2-5 Krejcikova (*denotes next server) A wonderful Krejcikova backhand down the line sets up three match points, but Gauff somehow makes it back to deuce! A mixture of Krejcikova choking on some easy baseline shots and Gauff’s gutsy plays. At 40-30 up, with Gauff stranded out wide, Krejcikova had the whole court to aim for to win the match, but she hits wide into the tramlines! And Gauff comes back to break! She couldn’t? Could she? Second set: Gauff 6-7 (6), 1-5 Krejcikova* (*denotes next server) Up until that double fault, I’m not sure how many consecutive points Krejcikova won but I would guess around a dozen. Gauff can’t win a grand slam quarter final with those numbers. A brief hiatus at 5-0 down, as Gauff briefly gathers herself – despite a couple of bad errors, including one errant volley that she shoved well long of the baseline, she aces out wide to hold her serve, and secure her first game of the second set. But Krejcikova will serve for the match. Second set: Gauff* 6-7 (6), 0-5 Krejcikova (*denotes next server) Gauff can’t a single shot in. Krejcikova races to another 40-0 lead on serve, and it is only a double fault that stops yet another hold of serve to love. Gauff is surely beaten, and Krejcikova is one game away from a semi-final at Roland Garros! Second set: Gauff 6-7 (6), 0-4 Krejcikova* (*denotes next server) The crowd try their best to get Gauff going, but the American looks on the verge of tears as she hits a double fault into the net at 0-40 down on her own serve. Her racket gets a good smashing, three separate blows on the clay leave it twisted and broken. A warning from the umpire, complete head loss from Gauff. This is easy for Krejcikova. Second set: Gauff* 6-7 (6), 0-3 Krejcikova (*denotes next server) The sound of an ambulance can be heard careering down some Parisian street outside Chatrier, and one can’t help feeling that it might be for Gauff, who is playing herself out of the tournament here. Krejcikova is doing nothing special, simply bunting it back the other end, as Gauff hits long and wide, time after time. A hold to love. Second set: Gauff 6-7 (6), 0-2 Krejcikova* (*denotes next server) Gauff is slightly wavering here. Her decision making has deteriorated, and Krejcikova is quite happy to stay in the rally with big looping shots that come down with snow on to land on Gauff’s baseline and the American is unable to use her power effectively. Clever, clever tennis from Krejcikova, who only needs one break point to race to a 2-0 lead in the second set! Second set: Gauff* 6-7 (6), 0-1 Krejcikova (*denotes next server) I still have no idea who is going to win this match. The quality of tennis in that first set ranged from top drawer to mediocre, particularly the serving. Again this looks like Krejcikova’s weakness as Gauff threatens with another break point. But Gauff looks a little too eager to capitalise on Krejcikova’s serving and she hits a return into a net before Krejcikova holds. An early mini-break for Krejcikova but she hands back the advantage with a double fault, her sixth of the set. But now Gauff does the same, her fifth double fault of the match so far. It looks very hot now on Chatrier, and I wonder if the sun is blinding the pair as they serve? Krejcikova looks set to go to a 4-2 lead in the tie-break but bins an easy shot into the net, and complains to the umpire about a call from the crowd that put her off. Will that throw the Czech off? Things aren’t helped as Gauff clips one off the net to go 5-4 up and then hits an unforced error barely half-way up the net. Two set points for Gauff! Krejcikova responds, just as she has all set, two clean forehand winner just when she needed it! We’re back to 6-6 in the tiebreak! What cajones from Krejcikova, who now forces her own set point … and she gets it with a serve out wide and forehand winner! I’m not quite sure how, but the Czech player is halfway to her first ever grand slam semi-final! First set: Gauff* 6-6 Krejcikova (*denotes next server) Gauff races to 0-30, showing a bit of patience in the rally that has been missing this set. She is often so desperate to play the Hollywood winner, which is so often is capable of hitting, but forgets to play the percentages, which of courses makes for much more entertaining tennis. Krejcikova is having issues with her ball toss, but battles back to 30-30. This feels like a microcosm of the first set. Gauff gets to set point, and despite two more ball tosses that nearly end up next to the corporate seats, Krejcikova somehow gets back to deuce. Again, Gauff gets to break point with a outrageous winner on the run, before Krejcikova saves her set with her first backhand winner of the match, landing just inside the line. What a time to pull that one out! Gauff is the one to crumble now, with two unforced errors, and Krejcikova somehow holds! To a tie-break we go! First set: Gauff 6-5 Krejcikova* (*denotes next server) Spectacular from both players, but Gauff in particular. The American gets to a drop volley, hits a clean winner with two feet fully off the ground, and then somehow scrambles to hit a sublime forehand up the line. At 40-15, she serves out the game. Absolutely ridiculous. Gauff is absolutely ridiculous. Krejcikova was powerless there but it remains on serve. First set: Gauff* 5-5 Krejcikova (*denotes next server) As simple a hold as you are ever likely to see from Krejcikova, who even threw in a slice (!!!) to change up the pace and unnerve Gauff. First set: Gauff 5-4 Krejcikova* (*denotes next server) Gauff’s first ace takes her to 30-15, before another takes her to set point at 40-30. A huge scream from the American carries around Chatrier. She is FIRED UP! But then! A wayward Gauff backhand and a double fault hands break point to Krejcikova, before Gauff bins a simple shot into the net. We’re back on serve! Really difficult to predict where this set and match is going to go. Both players are hitting aces, winners and double faults, looking equally sublime and ridiculous in the process. First set: Gauff* 5-3 Krejcikova (*denotes next server) Krejcikova beginning to win a few cheap point on her serve – she wants to keep the rallies short if she can, as Gauff’s mobility around the court is far superior. Gauff isn’t playing her best but gets to break point, and bullies her way past the Czech with a ripping crosscourt forehand. Gauff will serve for the first set! First set: Gauff 4-3 Krejcikova* (*denotes next server) It’s only when the camera focuses on Gauff’s face that we remember how young she is. She’s got to show a little bit of maturity here, having lost the last three games. Three double faults in the game don’t help her here in this game, and a couple of errant ball tosses maybe betray her own nerves. But a clever serve out wide sends Krejcikova nearly hurtling into the stands and Gauff holds to break the run of games in her favour. We’re on serve. First set: Gauff* 3-3 Krejcikova (*denotes next server) A break point down, Krejcikova fires her first ace up the T to relieve some pressure before a second ace sets up game point. Krejcikova hits a heavy ball out wide, Gauff cannot retrieve and suddenly we’re all square! First set: Gauff 3-2* Krejcikova (*denotes next server) OK, OK, looks like we’ve got ourselves a ball game. Again, Gauff shows signs of her power and accuracy in some points, but Krejcikova is growing into this match. Her baseline shots are getting deeper and fiercer and she’s looking like she’s enjoying herself now. Gauff hits long and we’re a break each at 3-2! First set: Gauff* 3-1 Krejcikova (*denotes next server) Krejcikova gets on the board with her first game and cracks her first smile of the day. It looks like the weight of the world has lifted off of her shoulders now that she knows that she won’t be bagelled. A real battling hold that, because in between a few sloppy errors, Gauff put on an exhibition of fabulous shots, from backhand winners to a deft drop volley at the net, to a wonderful scrambling defence to cover the baseline.

Now the Souths man is away and avoiding a tackle. Just as the whistle blows a melee breaks out. This pushing and shoving always makes me giggle.

Luai cuts a swathe through the Maroons’ belly, beating Kaufusi. Mitchell is there and looks for Trbojevic under the posts. It’s too easy. This is unassailable. Trbojevic and Mitchell are the Blues Brothers on a mission from God. 57 mins: What was I saying about Martin’s baptism of fire? Munster has stuck his boot in to the Panthers player and is still on the field. 54 mins: The Blues are clearly not going to leave this to chance and have their opponents pinned back on their line. Murray is off for a HIA and Liam Martin has been brought on. Tough time for a debut. Here’s Mitchell’s try. 50 mins: Latrell makes some magic, adding his own try at the left corner. NSW are having a lot of joy on the sides. Panthers teammates Cleary and Luai set it up and Trbojevic gives the ball a little kick right where Mitchell needs. Feldt is on report for attacking Murray’s head with upper arm or shoulder. Very difficult to see Qld coming back from this. 48 mins: This is becoming more aggressive. Sutton is having words with Luai. More accurately, he is repeatedly calling Luai, who is dawdling. Ofahengaue had just cleaned up Tedesco before he could take a high ball. Luai appears to have a crack and Ofahengaue ... slaps him? Luai eventually approached the ref and calls him “bro” before accepting his warning. 46mins: Munster kicks long and Tedesco scoops it up. NSW make up some ground but Haas can’t quite get an offload away. It bounces, and Cook has a fruitless crack. Bit of an opportunity here for the Maroons. 43 mins: Qld could do with a run of possession. They’ve been on the wrong end of a lot of the stats thus far and need to give this home crowd some love. Grant is on the move but tackled by Sims. Fifita is back on the field having passed his HIA. Yikes, Luai has been taken out contesting the ball in the air with Coates, who was clearly going for the ball. It was an accident and Luai is okay. 40 mins: Fittler has never clapped so hard in his coaching box, thrilled at Mitchell’s defensive stand to help the Blues off their own goal line. Now the Souths man is away and avoiding a tackle. Just as the whistle blows a melee breaks out. This pushing and shoving always makes me giggle. Apparently Murray did not like something Feldt did to Addo-Carr while he was on the ground. But it changes nothing, because the Blues lead by 14 points and have set Paul Green’s hosts a second-half task. 38 mins: Qld have six again and a good chance to close the deficit a little further. Munster takes a stab in the dark and To’o is on the ball before you can say ‘boo’ but he’s brought to ground and Qld have another set. 36 mins: Capewell is in, and boy did Qld need that just before half-time. Holmes is set quite an angle but he converts with aplomb. Trbojevic won’t be happy with the mistake that let Capewell through. Referee Sutton has just sent Cleary off the field to have his face seen to. 34 mins: Players are in the wars out there. Cleary’s cut keeps dripping and Fifita is now off for a HIA. Kaufusi drops the ball right after Qld had a six again. 32 mins: Here’s the first try from Trbojevic, who has been literally everywhere. 27 mins: Queensland are on the ropes this entire set as NSW make short passes out to the left. Gagai has tackled Sims quite low which has left his arms free for a perfect pass to To’o in space to run the last couple of steps home. Cleary has been patched up and converts on the angle. To compound the bad news for Qld is news that Welch has failed his HIA. Unsurprising given how he looked. 24 mins: This time it’s To’o in the left corner. Cook is the orchestrator, weaving through the Maroons defence and letting fly a pass which hits Tedesco and bounces backwards. He regathers and then it’s Luai, Mitchell and To’o. Cleary has blood streaming down his face. But my, Cook is so fast. He is a surf lifesaving flags champion, did you know? Mitchell slots the conversion. 18 mins: Tommy Turbo! He’s rushing forward on the right and receives a long pass, gets on the outside of a static Capewell and is in. That was too easy, and my Queensland will be feeling about that needless penalty in the lead-up when Feldt took out Addo-Carr to give NSW six again right on their line. Trbojevic has been a standout so far. 16 mins: Looks like Munster hasn’t heard a six-to-go call. Crowd must be deafening. He kicks, and gifts NSW possession. 13 mins: Luai stabs the ball into Queensland’s corner and Holmes scoops up. Feldt brings the ball to the 30m line and Cherry-Evans kicks early. Ouch. Welsh is dizzy after a head clash. He stumbles attempting to walk and a trainer accompanies him off the field for an HIA. His night should be over. 10 mins: This game is lightning fast on this hard pitch. And how different the conditions are in Townsville at 18C while Melbourne, where this was supposed to be played is 18C and rainy. DCE is penalised and Nathan Cleary does the honours to give the Blues their first two points. Probably fair – they have had the better of the opening exchanges. 5mins: Kyle Feldt has had a nice couple of touches, a Townsville man making his debut at 29 as the Maroons edge forward. Fifita is up for it though. The ball is ping-ponging around before NSW are back in position but there’s been a needless drop as they approached the 20m line. Mitchell’s pass was not amazing but Sims probably should have caught it. 2mins: NSW run through a set before Cleary gets a kick away and Welsh and Grant makes some ground. The players are out on the field and the Welcome to Country has been performed. Now it’s the anthem. Getting close. I don’t have the benefit of Gallen’s wisdom, but from where I stand NSW will be best served with a couple of settling early tries, start on the front foot and remove Queensland’s home advantage. The stadium is seriously Maroon right now, maybe the most we’ve ever seen it. Jarome Luai will be key, and I’m intrigued to see how the Panthers clique operates. As the players warm up in the sheds, former Blues captain Paul Gallen is out on the pitch offering sage words of advice. “Stick to the game plan. Give 100% effort, 100% of the time. And if all else fails, just smash them.” Thanks Gal. Here’s more on the exceptional content out of Gladys Berejiklian’s ... darkened room? Only a matter of time before she’s trending. Here is the NSW team. The Maroons should be worried about Tom Trbojevic, according to James Tedesco. Have to say I concur. Not many blue shirts in the crowd, and it looks as if Flinders St is rocking. If you thought Brissy was Queensland territory, you should see Townsville. Gould is addressing the Blues’ position on the Nine panel: “We’re fine as long as they don’t jump the fence.” Believe it or not, NSW are favourites according to the bookies. I suppose that’s keeping with tradition. Billy Slater reckoned this week that the dry ground will suit Brad Fittler’s side. Guess we’ll find out shortly. The big question mark hovering ominously over this game is, of course, how the crackdown on high hits will manifest in terms of officiating. The NRL has already stated it will instruct referee Gerard Sutton to operate in the same manner as he would an NRL game, which would mean strict penalties for high contact, accidental or otherwise. Queensland captain Daly Cherry-Evans called for a “gentlemen’s agreement” between the two states not to milk high contact. NRL head of football Graham Annesley said it was “a concern”. “It’s an issue that’s difficult to deal with,” Annesley said this week. “The match review committee does have the ability to charge players with what they might consider to be contrary conduct. “I’d like to think the vast majority of players in our game do not do that. I’ve already seen the NSW Origin coach come out and say NSW players won’t be doing that, and I’m sure Queensland is the same.” Wondering if accidental contact will result in a send-off, or will there be some room to move with players placed on report and handled afterwards? The Queensland team has landed, and Ben Hunt is 18th man. All appears as expected. Gladys is getting the party started with all her friends. State of Origin week is rarely short of drama. Past years generated at least a headline a day and enough tit-for-tat to last a lifetime let alone 3x80 minutes of rugby league. In 2020, of course, the NRL backed down on its plan to forego the national anthem (hi ScoMo!). Similarly, the build-up to game one of this series did not disappoint. Granted, it has not delivered on a Robbie-Kearns-falls-off-a-horse level, but still ... we have witnessed NSW acts of espionage to conceal a SWAP IN POSITIONS between Blues wingers Josh Addo-Carr and Brian To’o, Queensland’s “smokescreening” around Dane Gagai’s alleged tonsillitis, and Phil Gould’s deep anxiety about the high-tackle crackdown’s potential to soften Origin’s “gladiators”. Oh, ICYMI, there was also a venue change after Victoria’s Covid outbreak forced game one to be moved to Townsville. Interested to hear your thoughts. It is, in my humble opinion, an excellent decision and a real regional win that could yet set a precedent for the future. Should we be sharing the Origin love a bit more? Anyway, here we go.

Posted on Wednesday to drum up support for New South Wales in its upcoming clash with Queensland in the State of Origin rugby league, the premier’s photo was instead widely mocked for its bizarre composition and strange elements. In the image, Berejiklian can be seen standing alone in a large room with the blinds drawn, watching a small, blurred television that is largely out of frame. With her back to the camera, the Liberal leader is holding an unopened can of sugar-free Coke. She’s wearing a Blues beanie and scarf. Within minutes of it being posted on Twitter and Facebook, the premier’s photographer and social media team were immediately criticised for having created the unsettling image. The photo was published at 4pm on Wednesday – more than four hours before the game was due to start. The premier’s televisual faux pas spawned hundreds of memes and drew comparisons to a surprisingly long list of other politicians who viewed their televisions from strange angles. In 2017, the former prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, made headlines for watching the outcome of the marriage equality postal survey on an extremely low TV, mounted inside a cabinet on the floor, while he remained standing. Later that night, he somehow found another way to observe a television incorrectly, when he watched the Socceroos beat Honduras in a World Cup qualifier from a very low angle, with the TV too high.

Both these qualities make it an ideal plant-based substitute for white fish in the classic chippie supper, offering a similar delicacy of flavour and satisfying contrast of textures without the distracting saltiness of halloumi or the chew of banana flowers, which are sometimes used as fish-free alternatives instead. After posting pictures of my various attempts online, I was astonished by the vehemence of the response, to which I say, no one’s forcing you to try it, but you shouldn’t knock it until you have – after all, although tofu isn’t without its environmental concerns, few would deny that we need to be more mindful of the fish we eat and, almost as importantly, this is bloody delicious. The tofu Most recipes call for extra-firm tofu, with a few simply specifying firm. In this instance, once it’s been pressed and battered, it doesn’t seem to make a great deal of difference, though I prefer the marginally softer texture of the latter. How you treat it is of greater importance – there’s no need to simmer it with salt and lemon to “add firmness”, as the Vegetarian Society recommends, because white fish is no firmer than tofu and certainly never chewy. The same goes for the time-honoured Japanese technique of freezing and then thawing the tofu before use, so it takes on the texture of a sponge – great if you want it to absorb maximum flavour from a marinade or to develop a crisp exterior, but completely unnecessary if you want it to retain its smooth, milky magnificence within a crunchy, batter jacket. One idea that is worth exploring, however, is cutting the tofu into large flakes, to mimic the texture of fish, as suggested by Sam Turnbull of the It Doesn’t Taste Like Chicken blog, who herself adapted it from Jules The Easy Vegan, who … well, whoever came up with it, it’s both obvious, and very effective.

This is a very intense, claustrophobic black comedy whose inner anxiety is underlined by Ariel Marx’s nerve-jangling score, which seems always to be leading us to some eruption of emotional hurt. And, in fact, there are two or three moments where the buzz of conversation is suddenly stilled by the raising of voices. The film is maybe a little callow, but it’s an undoubtedly impressive and accomplished debut. • Shiva Baby is released on 9 June in cinemas and on 11 June on Mubi.","charCount":"2140","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"true","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/peterbradshaw\">Peter Bradshaw</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2021/jun/09/i-fell-in-the-water-but-it-was-worth-it-guardian-readers-on-their-most-extraordinary-bird-photographs","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-09T11:00:48Z","webTitle":"‘I fell in the water, but it was worth it!’: Guardian readers on their most extraordinary bird photographs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jun/09/i-fell-in-the-water-but-it-was-worth-it-guardian-readers-on-their-most-extraordinary-bird-photographs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/jun/09/i-fell-in-the-water-but-it-was-worth-it-guardian-readers-on-their-most-extraordinary-bird-photographs","fields":{"headline":"‘I fell in the water, but it was worth it!’: Guardian readers on their most extraordinary bird photographs","standfirst":"<p>From friendly Antarctic penguins to the rainbow plumage of a Colombian hummingbird, our readers on their favourite images – and the lengths they went to to capture them.</p>","trailText":"From friendly Antarctic penguins to the rainbow plumage of a Colombian hummingbird, our readers on their favourite images – and the lengths they went to to capture them.","byline":"Guardian readers","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9b4eadc031dc06efe6af737e766f2412f7919dec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b4eadc031dc06efe6af737e766f2412f7919dec/0_262_4307_2584/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A male mandarin duck pictured in Balloch, Scotland in January 2021.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A male mandarin duck pictured in Balloch, Scotland in January 2021.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Fraser</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<h2>‘I had all but given up hope, when I saw bright orange feathers’</h2> <p>I took this photo at the end of January in Balloch, Scotland.

At the end of January, I had heard via Facebook that there was a pair of them up the road from me. I got up early and drove to Balloch. I had all but given up hope, when all of a sudden I saw the bright orange tail feathers of the duck in between some bushes on the river’s edge.

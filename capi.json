Victoria reported five new cases of Covid-19 on Saturday from 36,362 tests on day nine of Melbourne’s fourth lockdown, including two cases linked to the so-called Delta variant – which emerged in India during its devastating outbreak. On Saturday the infectious diseases expert Prof Sharon Lewin from the Doherty Institute was asked whether she believed the West Melbourne family that caught the strain could have caught it while holidaying in Jervis Bay in New South Wales. Lewin did not rule it out as a possibility – saying there was “extensive testing” occurring in the south coast holiday town – but said it was more likely the strain emerged from someone in hotel quarantine. “My strong hypothesis is that it’s coming through an importation from overseas, through our quarantine hotels. That would be the most likely,” she said. Lewin is leading sequencing efforts in Victoria in an attempt to track down the origin of the new strain but cautioned that it was possible the source would never be known definitively. “Every effort is being made right now to look for that match, but we may not get the match,” she said. More on the Delta variant in Victoria here: Italy is expecting a 20% tourism increase over 2020 as summer travel restrictions ease, the Italian tourism federation said. The federation has said: “The 2021 summer season is showing the first signs of a sector recovery. Between June and August, 33m arrivals are forecast along with 140m nights spent in official (tourist) structures – a 20.8% rise on 2020.” Assoturismo added that the rise “would not be enough to return to pre-Covid levels” because during summer 2019, the last before the pandemic, an additional 73.5m nights were spent in the country. AFP reports that, before the pandemic, tourism had accounted for 14% of Italy’s GDP, the EU’s third-largest economy, but the Covid fallout had helped to tip the country into its worst recession since the second world war. Italy hopes to welcome 6.7m more foreign tourists this year than in 2020, but arrivals will still be down, by about two-thirds, on 2019 when the 100m mark was passed. Assoturismo president Vittorio Messina said: “After 12 terrible months, Italian tourism finally can detect concrete signs of recovery. But it is still a slow recovery, above all where foreign demand is concerned which will not be enough to pull back what was lost with the pandemic. Our hope is that end of season sales give us better results thanks to the European health passport.” While the first cruise ship set sail from Venice on Saturday, some residents protested over the return to normal, unhappy about the passage of liners throughout the historical lagoon city. Hundreds of people gathered on land and on small boats, waving flags saying “No big ships” as the 92,000-tonne MSC Orchestra departed Venice port en route for Croatia and Greece. Reuters reports: We are here because we are against this passage but also against a model of tourism that is destroying the city, pushing out residents, destroying the planet, the cities, and polluting,” said Marta Sottoriva, a 29-year old teacher and Venice resident. But port authorities, workers and the city government welcomed the departure of the Orchestra, operated by MSC Cruises, seeing it as a symbol of business kicking off after the health crisis that hit hard at the cruise industry and the wider travel sector. “We are happy to be back ... to restart the engines. We care a lot about Venice and we’ve been asking for a stable and manageable solution for ships for many years,” said Francesco Galietti, national director for the trade group Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA). Some residents have been urging governments for years to ban large cruise ships and other big vessels from passing through the lagoon and docking not far from the famed St Mark’s Square. Campaigners worry about safety and the environment, including pollution and underwater erosion in a city already in peril from rising sea waters. “The struggle is very long, I think we are against very big financial interests,” Marco Baravalle, a 42-year old researcher, and member of the No Grandi Navi (No big ships) group. He and other protesters were worried that “everything will go back to what we had before the pandemic”, he added. Italy’s government ruled in April that cruise ships and container vessels must not enter Venice’s historic centre but rather dock elsewhere. But the ban will not take effect until terminals outside the lagoon have been completed, and a tender for their construction has not been launched yet. Part of the traffic may be diverted to the nearby port of Marghera from next year. Britain’s decision to relegate Portugal to the amber travel list left Francina Pinheiro totally exasperated. “We’ve done everything by the book here,” said Pinheiro, the owner of a cafe beside Torre dos Clérigos, one of Porto’s landmark sights, as customers arrived for lunch on Friday. “We sanitise everything, we’ve reduced our table numbers. All so we can welcome our friends from overseas. And, pah, now they shut the door on us!” The usually perky Pinheiro was still shaking her head over the decision. After months in the doldrums, the sight of tourists recently returning to her pavement tables and sipping on a fino (small beer) or trying her prized bolinhos (fishcakes) had put a skip in her step. Now British visitors are set to join her American and Brazilian customers – another important source of income – in disappearing from Porto’s streets. That leaves her falling back on local customers, who, loyal as they may be, tend to content themselves with a €0.95 cup of black coffee. More of the story here: The Indian airline IndiGo reports its fifth straight quarterly loss on Saturday as the pandemic continues to keep air travel well below normal pre-Covid levels. The company reported a net loss of 11.47bn Indian rupees ($157.43m) in the three months ended 31 March, compared with 8.7bn rupees a year earlier. Reuters reports: This has been a very difficult year with our revenues slumping hard due to Covid, showing some signs of recovery during the period December to February and then slumping again with the second wave of the Covid,” IndiGo CEO Ronojoy Dutta said in a statement. The coronavirus pandemic is a period of great trial for IndiGo shareholders and staff, Dutta said, adding that the carrier was strengthening its core to emerge stronger when the sector recovers from the current situation. India’s aviation sector is reeling under losses, with air travel brought to a halt for several weeks last year. The country’s airlines are expected to lose a total of $4bn this fiscal year, aviation consultancy CAPA estimated – similar to their losses last fiscal year through to 31 March. Just as air travel in India was beginning to recover earlier this year, a second more deadly wave of the pandemic hit the nation, killing hundreds of thousands of people. Most Indian states were under lockdown in April and May, and the government has restricted airlines to fly only 50% of their total capacity. France recorded 57 new deaths on Saturday, adding to the total of 83,547 coronavirus-related deaths in hospital. The country’s health authorities also reported that were 2,525 people in ICU for Covid-19, with Saturday’s figures down by 46. Coronavirus has resulted in the deaths of at least 3,714,923 people since the outbreak emerged in December 2019, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP. So far, at least 172,499,930 cases of coronavirus have been registered. The figures compiled by AFP are based on the daily Covid-19 reports provided by health authorities in each country. The World Health Organisation estimates that the pandemic’s overall toll could be two to three times higher than official records due to the excess mortality that is directly and indirectly linked to Covid-19. Based on the latest reports, the US is the worst affected country with 597,001 deaths from 33,346,365 cases. After the US, the hardest-hit countries are Brazil, with 470,842 deaths from 16,841,408 cases, India with 344,082 deaths from 28,694,879 cases, Mexico with 228,568 deaths from 2,429,631 cases, and Peru with 185,813 deaths from 1,976,166 cases. The country with the highest number of deaths compared with its population is Peru with 564 fatalities per 100,000 inhabitants, followed by Hungary with 309, Bosnia-Herzegovina with 286, the Czech Republic with 282, and The Republic of North Macedonia with 261. Ministers from the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) trade group have agreed to speed up the transit of Covid-19 vaccines and related goods at ports, a statement on Saturday said. Reuters reports that the APEC ministers met in New Zealand, where they also agreed to consider voluntary actions to reduce the cost of vaccines to fight the pandemic. Italy has recorded 57 coronavirus deaths and 2,436 new cases, the Italian health ministry has reported. Saturday’s data is lower than the figures recorded yesterday, with 73 deaths reported on Friday and 2,557 new cases. Not including those in intensive care, patients in hospital stood at 5,193 on Saturday, down from 5,488 a day earlier. There were 20 new admissions to intensive care units, down from 22 on Friday. The total number of intensive care patients fell to 788 from a previous 836. Nearly 238,632 Covid tests were carried out in the past day, compared with a previous 220,939, the health ministry said. The UK records 13 new deaths and 5,765 new cases on Saturday, government data showed. The latest figures had also shown that 40,124,229 had now received their first vaccination shot, and 27,160,635 had received two doses. Hi, I’m Edna Mohamed; I’ll be taking you through the next few hours, if I miss anything you can message me on Twitter or drop me an email at edna.mohamed.casual@theguardian Here’s a brief summary of the major recent developments: A record 600,000 vaccine doses were administered in Italy on Friday. Citing local authorities, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that that put the country in second place in Europe for the number of people fully vaccinated. Going ahead with the UK’s planned reopening on 21 June would be “foolish” and a “major risk”, an expert on an advisory group to the UK government warned. Prof Stephen Reicher said there was enough evidence to say that one of the government’s four key tests for its road map out of lockdown has not been met. India recorded 120,529 new cases in 24 hours as its capital, New Delhi, undertook a partial easing of its lockdown. The city was preparing to deal with an infection peak of 37,000 cases a day, its chief minister said. That’s it from me – I’m handing over to my colleague, Edna Mohamed. The people of Glasgow can finally hug loved ones, meet in homes and drink alcohol indoors for the first time in months, after the city dropped to level 2 of Scotland’s coronavirus measures – alongside an easing of restrictions across the country. While the whole of mainland Scotland was supposed to move to level 1 on Monday, the city will join 13 other council areas in remaining in level 2 for another few weeks. Announcing the move on Tuesday, the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said that while the level 2 restrictions were “still tough”, they were at least “not lockdown”. She added: “We can go into each other’s homes, we can see hospitality open, stay open indoors, so there are significant steps there.” The planned scrapping of remaining restrictions in England on 21 June has been thrown into doubt with reports that the government is looking at contingency plans including a two-week delay to allow more adults to be fully vaccinated. The Telegraph and the Financial Times reported on Saturday that civil servants were drawing up contingency plans to delay the easing lockdown restrictions by two weeks, possibly to 5 July. A senior Whitehall source told the FT: A variety of options are being drawn up, including a delay to step 4 and trading off some measures against others. These are the most pressing issues likely to be covered during Hancock’s grilling: Matt Hancock, the UK’s health secretary, was calling on the government to take Covid more seriously as early as January last year, his allies have claimed, as he prepares to give his full response to explosive accusations over his handling of the pandemic. Hancock is set to undergo hours of questioning before MPs on Thursday after Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson’s former senior adviser, said the health secretary should have been fired on up to 20 separate occasions for various Covid failings. Cummings’ claim that Hancock misled the prime minister over sending untested hospital patients back to care homes – an allegation he denies – is set to be a key focus of the hearing. However, with a highly pressurised grilling in prospect, insiders sympathetic to Hancock said he had regularly been one of the cabinet ministers urging most caution on the lifting of Covid restrictions – and had also been calling for the government’s Cobra emergency committee to meet from very early in 2020. They said Hancock had been pushing for quarantine for travellers from China to the UK before official advice supported the idea – when others in government were suggesting they should be allowed to travel home immediately by train. NHS England data shows a total of 7,254,217 jabs were given to people in London between 8 December and 4 June, including 4,497,648 first doses and 2,756,569 second doses. This compares with 6,287,623 first doses and 4,477,536 second doses given to people in the Midlands, a total of 10,765,159. The breakdown for the other regions is: East of England: 4,003,822 first doses and 2,777,778 second doses, making 6,781,600 in total North-east and Yorkshire: 5,221,289 first and 3,631,836 second doses (8,853,125) North-west: 4,249,530 first and 2,954,182 second doses (7,203,712) South-east: 5,464,828 first and 3,783,734 second doses (9,248,562) South-west: 3,547,393 first and 2,632,020 second doses (6,179,413) A further 471,939 vaccine doses have been administered in England in the last 24 hours, according to NHS England data. That took the total in the country between 8 December 2020 and 4 June 2021 to 56,602,996. NHS England said 150,337 of the new administered shots were first doses and 321,602 were second doses, taking the respective totals to 33,525,485 and 23,077,511. A record 600,000 vaccine doses were administered in Italy on Friday, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports, citing local authorities. That put the country in second place in Europe for the number of people fully vaccinated. “Yesterday was marked by a record number of injections in 24 hours which touched the 600,000 mark, while the number of doses administered crossed the 37 million mark,” the government body in charge of vaccinations said on Saturday. “Italy is in second place in Europe in terms of the number of people fully vaccinated, just behind Germany and ahead of France and Spain,” it added. According to AFP, it said Friday’s record vaccinations were in part due to an increase in the number of vaccination centres, which now stood at 2,666 against 1,500 at the start of March. About 800 new centres will be opened in the coming weeks. According to official government figures, 37m vaccine doses have been administered and 12.7 million people – or nearly 24% of the population aged older than 12 years – have been vaccinated. The pandemic has claimed 126,415 lives in Italy, where the number of cases and deaths has been falling steadily in recent weeks. The government has been slowly easing Covid restrictions, relaxing a night curfew and opening up indoor dining in restaurants and bars. Progress is being made towards a deal on an intellectual property waiver for Covid-19 vaccines at the World Trade Organization (WTO), the US trade representative Katherine Tai said on Saturday. Backers of a patent waiver for Covid vaccines say it would boost vaccine production and improve delivery to poorer countries. These countries are battling surges in Covid-19 infections and struggling to access vaccine supplies as well as diagnostics, therapeutics and medical devices. Tai pointed to a revised proposal from the original proponents of the waiver, led by India and South Africa, as well as principles the EU has come up with to guide how they would like to negotiate the issues, Reuters reports. In a surprise shift in May, the US moved to supporting a patent waiver, piling pressure on opponents such as the EU and Switzerland, where many drugmakers are based. Tai told reporters before a meeting of trade ministers in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum: We’re actually really encouraged to see more WTO members come forth with proposals on what they can support at the WTO with respect to intellectual property rules at the WTO and how they apply to the Covid vaccines. The latest draft from proponents of the waiver sets a time span for a waiver of at least three years and would allow the WTO’s 164 members to determine when it ends. A huge queue has formed outside a health centre in Harrow, in London, which is offering jabs to people aged 18 and over. Belmont health centre in Stanmore, Harrow, is open on Saturday to over-18s who are still waiting for their first vaccine and who live or work in Harrow. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is being administered all day at the walk-in clinic and people do not need to be registered with the practice to get their vaccine. National eligibility criteria in England states that only those aged 30 and over are invited for their first jab, and it is understood that health officials want to prioritise that cohort in Harrow rather than younger age groups, PA news reports. But the poster advertising the walk-in centre clearly states that people aged 18 and over can come along, and the majority of people waiting appeared to be in their 20s. By mid-morning, a huge queue had formed in the area of the health centre, with the line snaking around a car park and stretching down the street. Among them were 20-year-old students Jamie Lesser and Daniel Simmons who arrived at around 8.15am. Lesser said it will be a relief to get the jab, telling the PA news agency: “If all plans go ahead, clubs are going to open in three weeks’ time and we both have plans to go out.” He said he had clubbing plans for “about five days in a row” if nightclubs open, “making up for the last year and a half”. Lesser said he found out about Saturday’s walk-in through friends in a group chat who had forwarded on information about it. He said: To be honest we weren’t intending to give up the whole of the Saturday. We were going to go to the gym fairly early … Thought we’d get here very early to avoid the queue, which hasn’t been very successful. Simmons said that as soon as he saw the chance to get the jab, he thought he would “jump on it”, adding: “I want to get it as soon as possible really.” Queueing for his jab, Chand Shah, a 25-year-old accountant, said the walk-in centre was “heavily advertised” and he thought it was a “good idea” to get the vaccine before the possible further easing of restrictions on 21 June. Asked if he expected to get his vaccine so soon, he said: “No. I was expecting August to be honest.” Shah added: “I think if you get the vaccine you feel safer.” South Korea’s respect for intellectual property rights makes it an ideal partner for the United States as it seeks to decouple its supply chains from China and forge partnerships to manufacture coronavirus vaccines, a trio of US senators said on Saturday during a visit to Seoul. The Democrat senators Tammy Duckworth and Chris Coons, and the Republican senator Dan Sullivan, were in South Korea as part of their first official overseas trip since the pandemic began. After last month’s summit in Washington between Joe Biden and South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in – who was only the second international leader to be welcomed by Biden as president – the senators said their visit was sign of the importance Washington places on South Korea’s role in countering China and shoring up global supply chains amid the pandemic. Duckworth told a group of reporters: We can trust in the legal system here, and we can trust that our intellectual property rights will be protected. South Korea is a logical partner. This is critical whether it is manufacturing [computer] chips or pharmaceuticals. A day after Biden and Moon met, the US drugmakers Moderna and Novavax entered into a deal with South Korea for its Covid-19 vaccines to be manufactured in the country, which has been seeking to secure more and faster deliveries of US-made vaccines. Here’s a brief summary of the major recent developments: Going ahead with the UK’s planned reopening on 21 June would be “foolish” and a “major risk”, an expert on an advisory group to the UK government warned. Prof Stephen Reicher said there was enough evidence to say that one of the government’s four key tests for its road map out of lockdown has not been met. India recorded 120,529 new cases in 24 hours as its capital, New Delhi, undertook a partial easing of its lockdown. The city was preparing to deal with an infection peak of 37,000 cases a day, its chief minister said. Covid-19 policies risk leaving psychological and socioeconomic scars on millions of young people across Europe, with far-reaching consequences for them and society, a wide-ranging Guardian project has revealed. Taking a snapshot, the Guardian asked five members of Europe’s Generation Z how the worst global pandemic in a century has affected their lives, what they have learned and how they see their future after the pandemic. The boss of Airlines UK has complained about a lack of transparency and consistency in the government’s changes to travel rules. Tim Alderslade, the chief executive of the industry body that represents UK carriers, said ministers had not kept to promises over a “green watchlist” that would have given travellers increased warning about a country potentially coming off the safe list. His comments came after the government decided to move Portugal out of the green list and into the amber travel category. It means people arriving in the UK from Portugal after 4am on Tuesday will need to self-isolate at home for 10 days, a change that has left holidaymakers scrambling for expensive return flights in an attempt to beat the quarantine deadline. Speaking about the “green watchlist” proposal, Alderslade told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: It would be a list of countries that were on the cusp, [where] there was a risk that they would be moving from green to amber, so passengers were aware of that, it was fully transparent and they would be taking that risk when they booked. It was entirely to stop what happened last summer when countries were moving up and down off the corridor list on a weekly basis and we saw people stranded overseas and then desperate to come home again because they couldn’t afford to quarantine. It has caused complete pandemonium because we don’t have that watchlist that we were promised by the government and I think with the taskforce, the transparency is not there, we don’t know what has to happen for countries to move from green to amber, or amber to green for that matter. Everyone aged older than 12 years in specific postcode areas of the English county of Berkshire will be offered PCR testing over the next two weeks from Monday in an effort to tackle the spread of the Delta variant. Meradin Peachey, the director of public health for Berkshire West, said a “real concern” with this variant is that if it keeps circulating there may be more mutations. She told BBC Breakfast: What’s happened in the last couple of weeks, especially in the last week, we’ve noticed that a lot of cases now coming through we can’t link to any travellers, which means we now have community transmission. She said cases are mainly among young people, with “virtually nobody over 60 or anyone who has been vaccinated” affected. She added: If the variant spreads and becomes even more, it may mutate again and the big concern is that vaccines won’t work. We really want to get people tested and isolated if they’ve got the virus, stop the spread so that we can make sure the vaccination programme works. Earlier, Dr Mike Tildesley, a member of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (Spi-M) UK government advisory panel, said ministers had a “difficult call” to make. He told Times Radio: It’s a hard one. I’m going to be annoying and sit a little bit on the fence on this, as I don’t think it’s our role as epidemiologists to call that. I think the difficult thing that we have, the difficult situation the government have, is of course if you delay that then of course you’ll get a smaller subsequent wave. I mean, that’s the case with any control policy – if you leave them in for a longer period of time then it’s going to reduce cases. But, of course, if you delay that we know that negatively impacts businesses, people’s livelihoods, and so forth. So, this is the difficult call that they have to make, and all we can do is put together as much evidence as possible and say this is what we expect to happen if you relax on 21 June, this is what we may expect if you delay that by two weeks for example, or four weeks and so on, so they have all the evidence they can to make the decision. It is clear that it would be “foolish” and a “major risk” to go ahead with the 21 June reopening, an expert on an advisory group to the UK government has said. Prof Stephen Reicher said there was enough evidence to say one of the government’s four key tests for its roadmap out of lockdown had not been met, according to the PA news agency. The member of the Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours (Spi-B), which advises the government, said the criteria about the current assessment of the risks not being fundamentally changed by new variants of concern was “not upheld” due to the spread of the Delta variant. Reicher told the news agency: I think, by the government’s own criteria, it’s quite clear that it would be foolish to proceed on the data that we’ve got at the moment. The risk would be very great indeed. And of course it’s a balance of risks but I think it would be a major risk to go further in opening up. Again, I make the point that it is about data not dates, and if you make it too much about the dates then you box yourself into a corner and I think that’s what the government has done. Marton Aszalos, a Hungarian paramedic, and Eniko Tokacs-Mathe, a vet, had to cancel their wedding twice during the pandemic and are finally getting ready for their big day this summer as restrictions are lifted. Reuters reports that the couple, who met in 2016 at a clinic where Eniko was working and Marton was then a trainee, say the emotional rollercoaster of the past 18 months has been draining but has made their relationship stronger. Eniko told the news agency: Because of the pandemic, we had to replan our wedding for the third time; both its date and the venue. The pandemic has also had a serious mental and physical affect on my fiancé as he is an ambulance officer. Reuters reports that the couple held a civil ceremony a month ago and are preparing for a wedding party with more than 100 guests in the town of Makó, near the Romanian border. Eniko is from Transylvania and many of her relatives will cross to Hungary to attend. They have been rehearsing their waltz for the wedding night, after a photo shoot on a motor boat on the Danube. Eniko said: Before, I thought my main worries would be whether we manage the lift in the dance, whether my makeup and hair would look good. But now, I am just happy and hope that all the guests and relatives can make it in health and we can celebrate together. Many couples are relieved that with 53% of Hungarians vaccinated, they can now go ahead and get married, Reuters reports. Gabor Herendi, a wedding planner, usually handles 30 to 35 weddings a year. But, in 2020, about 70% were postponed to this year. After the long wait, “energies will be multiplied”, he said. Hawaii will drop its quarantine and testing requirements for travellers once 70% of the state’s population has been vaccinated, the Associated Press reports, citing the governor, David Ige. The state will also lift its requirement that people wear masks indoors once that level has been reached. The state health department website said 59% of Hawaii’s population had had at least one dose of a vaccine and 52% had finished their dosing regimen. The AP reports: The state is using its figures, and not those provided by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to calculate thresholds for lifting restrictions. The health department director, Dr Libby Char, said that’s because Hawaii’s numbers are more accurate. She said it appeared the CDC had been counting some of Hawaii’s doses twice. Right now, travellers arriving from out of state must spend 10 days in quarantine or, to bypass that quarantine, they must show proof of a negative test taken before departure for the islands. Once 60% of Hawaii’s population is vaccinated, Ige said, the state will allow travellers to bypass a quarantine requirement as long as they can prove they were vaccinated in the US. Restrictions on travel between the islands will open up before that. Ige said that as of 15 June, people will be able to fly inter-island without taking a test or showing proof of vaccination. Also on that date, those who have been vaccinated in Hawaii may bypass quarantine when returning from a trip out of state. Russia has reported 9,145 new cases, including 2,897 in Moscow, taking the official national tally since the pandemic began to 5,117,274. According to Reuters, the government’s taskforce said 399 people had died in the past 24 hours, pushing the national death toll to 123,436. Taiwan has reported 511 new domestic cases, including 35 cases added to totals for recent days. That is up from the 472 domestic infections reported on Friday, Reuters reports. The agency also reports that Taiwan is in talks with US companies about making their vaccines, following similar talks with European firms, citing the health minister Chen Shih-chung. Taiwan, like much of the world, has been trying to speed up its vaccination programme following a spike in domestic cases, but has been stymied by global supply shortages. Chen told reporters that they previously had talks with European companies he did not name about producing their vaccines under licence. “Only recently have we started to have talks with US companies to see if it’s possible or not to carry out relevant subcontracting work,” he added, without providing details. Taiwan has ordered around 5m shots from the US firm Moderna, of which 150,000 have arrived. It has ordered 10m shots from the British-Swedish firm AstraZeneca. Taiwan, also in talks with BioNTech, blames China – which claims the island as its own territory – for blocking a deal with the German company earlier this year. Johnson &amp; Johnson said on Friday it had been in talks with Taiwan about providing its vaccine since last year. The number of confirmed cases in Germany increased by 2,294 to 3,697,927, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) shows, while the reported death toll has risen by 122 to 89,148. Mexico recorded 206 more deaths on Friday, bringing the total death toll to 228,568, its health ministry has said. Separate government data recently published suggests the real death toll may be at least 60% above the confirmed figure, Reuters has reported. Victoria, Australia’s second most populous state, has reported a small increase in locally acquired cases, as authorities hunt for the source of a new cluster of a highly infectious variant. Reuters reports: Five new local cases were reported, taking Victoria’s total to 70 in the latest outbreak, as the state capital, Melbourne, entered its second weekend of a hard lockdown, due to end on 10 June. Curbs were eased for the rest of the state on Friday. Saturday’s count was up from four new locally acquired cases on Friday. Authorities were alarmed after detecting the highly infectious Delta variant for the first time in Melbourne, sparking concerns cases could surge. There are now seven known cases in the city. The Delta variant, which has been classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as among the four variants of concern due to evidence that it spreads more easily, probably caused the latest devastating outbreak in India. Snap lockdowns, regional border restrictions and strict social distancing rules have helped Australia rein in prior outbreaks and keep its numbers relatively low at just 30,150 cases and 910 deaths. Victoria’s outbreak, which began on 24 May, has spurred people to join long queues for vaccinations following a slow rollout since February. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, said 20% of the adult population had now had a first dose of a vaccine. India’s capital city is preparing to deal with an infection peak of 37,000 cases a day in future, its chief minister has said, as the country as a whole reports 120,529 new cases over the last 24 hours. According to the Reuters agency, New Delhi’s political leader Arvind Kejriwal announced a partial easing of a lockdown, while the city is also preparing for oxygen storage capacity of 420 tons, and will set up genome sequencing labs to study coronavirus variants. Citing the federal health ministry, the agency reported 3,380 more deaths across India in 24 hours and said the tally of infections stood at 28.69 million and the death toll at 344,082.","charCount":"33971","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/edna-mohamed\">Edna Mohamed</a> (now) <a href=\"profile/kevin-rawlinson\">Kevin Rawlinson</a> and <a href=\"profile/nicola-slawson\">Nicola Slawson</a> (earlier)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2021/jun/05/battling-norrie-unable-to-derail-the-nadal-juggernaut","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-05T18:25:42Z","webTitle":"Battling Norrie unable to derail the Nadal French Open juggernaut","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/jun/05/battling-norrie-unable-to-derail-the-nadal-juggernaut","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2021/jun/05/battling-norrie-unable-to-derail-the-nadal-juggernaut","fields":{"headline":"Battling Norrie unable to derail the Nadal French Open juggernaut","standfirst":"<ul><li>Spaniard cruises to a 6-3 6-3 6-3 victory over British No 2</li><li>Nadal has now won 32 consecutive sets at Roland Garros</li></ul>","trailText":"Cameron Norrie’s run at the French Open came to an end as he lost in straight sets to Rafael Nadal in the third round.","byline":"Tumaini Carayol","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a093b50849862d527671a361d13a2b77de7f420\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a093b50849862d527671a361d13a2b77de7f420/0_246_3780_2268/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rafael Nadal eases to a straight-sets victory over Cameron Norrie at Roland Garros.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rafael Nadal eases to a straight-sets victory over Cameron Norrie at Roland Garros.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Having never stepped on to a tennis court with Rafael Nadal in the opening three years of his ATP tour career, Cameron Norrie is starting to become familiar with the best.

You know what to do! Thanks for reading this MBM, and the best of luck to Wales in Baku and, hopefully, beyond. Rob Page speaks to S4C. “There are no injuries, and we’ve got minutes into the players who needed a top-up. It’s always been about next week. We’ve got through unscathed, and we’re all on the plane on Monday looking forward to it. I have a pretty good idea [what the starting XI against Switzerland will be] so we’re pretty set with it. Barring any reactions, we have our plan. We were better in the second half, but irrespective of formations, if you do the basics right - which we didn’t do in the first half, I thought we were quite sloppy at times - it helps and we created a few chances. There was a lap of appreciation for us to say thanks to the fans for being so patient, it’s been an absolute nightmare for them. We’re all in it together, and we can’t wait.” Ben Davies speaks to Sky Sports. “It was a tough game. I don’t think everything went our way, but we’d rather it go that way now, than in the tournament. There’s a lot to work on this week, but no injuries is the most important thing. It was a proper game for a friendly, but we came through it fine. We’ve had a good few weeks of prep and we’re ready to get started in the tournament.” It was a feisty affair. Both sides could easily have had a couple of men sent packing, but the referee managed to keep a lid on it. Just about. Wales will be happy to have kept a clean sheet, one that extends their unbeaten home run to 13. They’ll also be pleased with the performance of their second-half subs: Kieffer Moore, Harry Wilson, Jonny Williams and, of course, Gareth Bale injected some much-needed sass into the performance. Neco Williams had a couple of moments as well, coming as close as anyone to breaking the deadlock. Wales will leave for the Euros in good spirits. Baku ahoy! No point using up all your goals / luck before the big event, right? 90 min +1: The game sputters out. 90 min: There will be two added minutes. 89 min: His players give it one last go. Some neat triangles are drawn down the left. Jonny Williams stands one up for Moore, who can’t quite get anything away. Wales have looked lively since the slew of substitutions. They’ve been much improved in this second half. 87 min: In his pre-match interview, Rob Page insisted this wasn’t really about the result. Nevertheless, he’s pacing around with a frown on, desperate for the winner that would see his team sent off to Baku with cheers ringing in their ears. 85 min: A rousing performance of Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau by the 6,000-strong choir. You make your own amusement when nothing else is going on. 83 min: A melee as Laci comes through the back of Jonny Williams, who springs up and squares up. A huge melee is the inevitable result. Once the comic-book cloud of dust with fists and boots poking out of it dies down, Laci is booked, along with his captain Abrashi and a slightly confused Mepham. 81 min: Another corner; Wilson’s delivery isn’t up to much this time. Wales are pressing hard for the feelgood winner. 80 min: Abrashi slides in on Johnny Williams, who springs up and performs the internationally recognised mime for Calm Down. The referee steps between them, just in case. 78 min: Moore is stopped illegally as he works his way down the right. Free kick. Wilson loops it in. Selmani punches clear, and wins a free kick for falling over, as keepers do. 77 min: Another Albanian sub, as Seferi replaces Manaj. 76 min: More changes. Jonny Williams replaces Brooks, while Bare comes on for Laci and Kallaku replaces Cekici. 74 min: In latest London Bus news, we’ve waited 73 minutes for an effort on target, now there’s been two in 60 seconds. Bale crosses from the left, Moore slaps a header straight at the keeper. 73 min: ... the ball’s worked out to Williams, who creams a shot from the edge of the D towards the top right. Selmani claims in unorthodox fashion, clawing the ball behind him then dropping to smother. That’s the first effort on target by either side. 72 min: Brooks and Wilson take turn to shoot at goal. Both efforts are blocked. Bale then makes his first contribution, winning a corner down the left. From which ... 71 min: With perfect showman’s timing, Bale comes on for Roberts. The assembled 6,000 do their level best to take the roof off the Cardiff City Stadium. 70 min: ... and they’re singing loud and long for Gareth Bale. 68 min: Harry Wilson looks in the mood for this. He drops a shoulder to shimmy his way down the inside-right channel, but doesn’t quite catch his shot, which is pulled harmlessly wide right. That’s pumped the crowd up even more, though. 66 min: Selmani goes walkabout down the right flank! He’s barged off the ball by Moore, and is pretty lucky to hear the referee’s whistle. That looked a fair charge, and Moore would have had a clear run towards an open goal. 65 min: The crowd are doing their bit. Plenty of beautiful noise. Not so much happening on the pitch right now. 63 min: So that’s taken the sting out of the game. Wales were beginning to put a bit of pressure on for the first time, too, Abrashi at one point nearly deflecting a low Roberts left-wing cross into his own net. 61 min: Substitutions galore. Wales replace Ramsey, Allen and Davies with Rodon, Wilson and Smith. Albania swap Lenjani and Balaj for Trashi and Cikalleshi. 58 min: Norrington-Davies shoves Manaj over the touchline near the dugout. Manaj clatters into his manager, who falls over. Edoardo Reja is 75 years old. The shove was clearly deliberate, though he almost certainly wasn’t trying to clean out the manager; even so, Norrington-Davies is lucky to escape with a yellow. 56 min: Ramsey picks out Brooks down the right. A lovely sliderule pass down the channel. Brooks pulls back to nobody in particular. Wales come again, Brooks this time sending a high ball into the mixer. Selmani claims on his line. 55 min: Neco Williams gets fed up of the sterile possession, and tries to blooter home from 30 yards. It’s always heading over the bar, but not by much, and there was plenty of venom behind it. He’s good fun to watch when he slips into Attack Mode. 54 min: See 52 min. 52 min: Wales ping it around for a while. All very pretty, though they never look like advancing into Albania’s final third. 50 min: A corner for Albania is half-cleared. Brooks inexplicably decides to juggle the ball on the edge of his own box, and is quickly stripped of possession. Djimsiti whistles a first-time shot miles over the bar. 49 min: A long ball down the Albanian inside-right channel. Manaj threatens to tear clear, and is caught by Davies. That looked an obvious foul, and Davies was the last man, but the referee decides to do nothing at all. Wales using up some karmic credit for the Neco Williams dismissal on Wednesday there. 48 min: With the arrival of Moore, may we direct you to this? 47 min: Ismajli steps on Ramsey’s foot. The stadium falls silent as the star midfielder stays down ... but then there’s a warm ripple of applause as he gets back up. Hopefully a sore whack, nothing more. Wales get the second half underway. They’ve replaced Ampadu with Moore, while Albania have swapped Doka for Veseli. Pre-tournament preparation. Ahead of the Euros, history buffs are advised to bone up on 60 years and 15 tournaments’ worth of action with Euro Summits: The Story of the European Championship by Jonathan O’Brien. Breezy yet comprehensive, fun but authoritative, think of it as a perfect companion piece for Cris Freddi’s famous Complete Book of the World Cup, and I can’t think of praise too much higher than that. Very enjoyable and highly recommended. There’s just enough time for Doka to take exception to a shove in the back from Norrington-Davies, keeper Selmani stepping in to keep the peace. And that’s the end of a first half in which Albania looked the more likely. Some half-time changes to come, I’ll be bound. 45 min: Williams sashays in from the right, evading a couple of challenges and getting the crowd going. Just as things look to open up, as he nears the penalty box, he miscontrols. A shame. 44 min: Bare tries to dribble out from the back but is pressed back by Brooks and Roberts. He eventually slips over and concedes a corner. It’s Wales’ first, and it’s a total non-event. 42 min: Wales establish a little more control, though only by lowering the intensity. They go nowhere as a result. 40 min: Brooks whips a ball in from the left. Ramsey slides in to meet at the near post, but can’t get his effort on target. That’s as dangerous as Wales have looked. 39 min: Ampadu hasn’t had a good game so far, but this is much better. Lenjani crosses deep from the left again, and Manaj is waiting to head home. He wins the aerial duel, nodding out for a corner, from which nothing develops. 38 min: But it all calms down quickly enough. Manaj is booked for getting involved in the thick of it, as is Brooks, who was brave in taking on the much larger Djimsiti, if nothing else. 36 min: Brooks and Djimsiti go forehead to forehead after a minor disagreement over a throw-in. A donnybrook threatens to break out. 34 min: Suddenly things open up for Wales, with Ramsey in acres on the edge of the box, screaming for the pass. Ampadu tries to feed it down the inside-right channel. Ramsey would be through on goal, but Ampadu slips and hoicks out for a goal kick. Ramsey is furious, and no wonder; that was a simple pass, and neither Welsh player was under any pressure whatsoever. A big chance spurned. 32 min: Davies tries to get something going by launching long. The keeper Selmani claims with nobody in red anywhere near him. Other than this, he’s had nothing to do. 30 min: Albania are pinging it around nicely. They look much better than their world ranking of 66 suggests. 28 min: Albania win the first corner of the match, reward for Lenjani’s deep cross, Mepham forced to head behind. Balaj can’t get a header on target, and Wales look to break through Allen. He’s shoved over cynically by Ismajli, who takes a booking for the team. That promised to be a dangerous counter. 26 min: There hasn’t been much for Wales to shout about so far, but here’s to a lovely pirouette out on the left, a dragback and spin that allows him to escape from a couple of men in one elegant move. It leads to nothing, but there’s nothing wrong with art for art’s sake. 24 min: Ampadu and Balaj clatter into each other. That’s a hefty 50-50 challenge, both men going into it at full pelt, and for a second it looks like the Welsh defender is hurt. Happily, he gathers himself and is soon up and about again. 22 min: Cekici is brought to ground by Roberts, who you suspect would be booked for the late slide in a competitive fixture. The referee merely ticks him off and awards the foul. Cekici gets up and flays the free kick deep into the stand, much to the annoyance of his manager Edoardo Reja, a friend and former team-mate of Fabio Capello at SPAL ... but we digress. 20 min: This is better, though, as Ramsey slips a ball down the inside-right channel for Brooks, who knocks the ball past Djimsiti and nearly breaks through. The Albanian defender stands firm, though, closing the door just in time. 18 min: Roberts tries to kick-start his team with some determined buzzing around as Albania play around at the back. He doesn’t achieve much, other than a block which flies back to the opposition, but his efforts draw a warm round of applause from the 6,000-strong crowd. They’ve had little else to cheer so far. 17 min: Albania should be ahead. A simple ball down the inside-right channel for Manaj. He barges Mepham out of the way with alarming ease and enters the box, only to send a rising shot well over the bar. A huge let-off for Wales, who need to wake up quicksmart. 16 min: Ampadu has had a fairly shaky start. Now he takes a throw, only to miscontrol when the ball’s returned to him. Throw to Albania. 14 min: Wales have enjoyed 66 percent of possession so far, but have done very little with it. No spark yet. 12 min: Ampadu plays a long ball down the right to nobody in particular. It bounces apologetically out of play near the corner flag. It’d have been sensational at Cardiff Arms Park. 10 min: Wales haven’t really got going yet. Albania are pressing hard, and most of the game so far has been played in the Welsh half, albeit nowhere near the Welsh box. Passing sequences at a premium right now. 8 min: Allen is bowled to the ground by Lenjani, though there’s no malice in the challenge, and the Albanian quickly apologises for his clumsiness. 7 min: Now it’s the turn of Neco Williams to get involved, unhappy with a late challenge by Lenjani. The referee might have his hands full here. 5 min: Manaj and Mepham have a brief exchange of views, causing the referee to step in and lay down the law. And here’s another sign that Albania haven’t just come to make up the numbers: Balaj puts Ampadu under some pressure, nicks the ball, and nearly scampers clear down the left. Wales swarm and put a stop to his gallop. 3 min: A long ball down the right nearly releases Brooks, but he can’t bring it down and it sails out for a goal kick. A poor first touch, which he acknowledges with an apologetic hand in the air. Shame, because Albania were very light at the back there. 2 min: A fairly gentle start to the game. Everyone’s just happy to be back. Albania kick off ... but only after everyone takes the knee. Not a boo to be heard. Wales 1, England 0. There’s no room for racism. Challenge it. Report it. Change it. Kick it out. The teams are out! Wales resplendent in dragon red, Albania forced into second-choice white. Albania’s national anthem swings along at a leisurely tempo; it would have made for good ITV closedown music back in the day. We’ll be off in a minute or two. “Ti’n gwylio’r gêm ar S4C?” writes Matt Dony. “Dylech fod yn rhugl yn Gymraeg erbyn y diwedd!” Sadly, there’ll be no Cymraeg-by-osmosis for me. I’ve panicked, bailed out, and gone over to Sky. Sori. Pre-match entertainment. A most welcome blast of Euro 2016 nostalgia, with the only football song in history, as far as we’re aware, to stir Welsh folk, electronica, early Atari video games and the sonic motif of Twiki from Buck Rogers in the 25th Century into a bubbling neo-psychedelic stew. Wales boss Rob Page speaks to S4C: “We can’t read too much into the shape or the personnel. These two friendlies were all about getting players the minutes they need. It’s all about Switzerland next week. We’re having a look at a couple of things. I want the players to go out there and enjoy themselves, it’s the last game before the start of the Euros and there are a few who will grab the opportunity with both hands, I hope, and give us an even bigger selection problem for next week. It’s great to have the fans in the stadium and hopefully we’ll put on a show for them.” We also have a Euro 2020 player guide that is shiny, fancy and ridiculously good fun. Legal disclaimer: the Guardian accepts no responsibility should you lose several hours of the day and/or get lost down many rabbit holes. The Guardian Experts’ Network is a many-splendored thing. Unique collaboration ... best media outlets on the continent ... local flavour and expertise ... you know the pack drill. We’re publishing two team guides each day in the run-up to the big kick-off, and you can have a good rummage here. Anyway, we’ve already done the team guide for Wales; in case you missed it, here it is, coming straight at you. The big news for Wales: Neco Williams has been cleared to play, despite picking up that preposterous red card against France. For detail-hungry, rule-curious completists, here’s the FAW statement: “Fifa have confirmed that as per article 27.2 of the Fifa Disciplinary Code the match falls under the jurisdiction of Uefa. Uefa Disciplinary Regulations do not legislate for sanctions related to friendly matches. The FAW have therefore sanctioned Neco Williams directly for the red card but can confirm he will be available to participate in tonight’s fixture.” Young Neco is one of only three players to keep their place in the starting XI. Chris Mepham and Joe Allen are the others who started the 3-0 defeat away to France on Wednesday. Ben Davies, Aaron Ramsey and Ethan Ampadu are back, while Gareth Bale sits on the bench, dreaming of splitting the fairway then sending a 7-iron to six feet. He might not be the only person doing that. Hey, it’s a pre-tournament warm-up, it is what it is. Wales: Hennessey, Ampadu, Mepham, Ben Davies, Neco Williams, Levitt, Allen, Ramsey, Norrington-Davies, Brooks, Tyler Roberts. Subs: Bale, Cabango, Colwill, Adam Davies, Gunter, Moore, Connor Roberts, Rodon, Smith, Ward, Jonathan Williams, Wilson. Albania: Selmani, Ismajli, Kumbulla, Djimsiti, Doka, Cekici, Bare, Abrashi, Lenjani, Manaj, Balaj. Subs: Ajeti, Cikalleshi, Harizaj, Hoxhallari, Kallaku, Laci, Ramadani, Seferi, Sherri, Trashi, Veseli. Referee: Neil Doyle (Ireland). It’s difficult to get a handle on Wales right now. Their last three matches against high-ranking big names have ended in fairly comprehensive defeats, 3-0 against England, 3-1 against Belgium, 3-0 against France. Other than that, though, they’re as dependable as they come: since the start of the 2019/20 season, their record against everyone else is played 15, won 11, drawn four. You’d expect them to see off Albania tonight, then, though this match isn’t really about the final score. What’s important is grooving everyone in, with Switzerland in the Euros looming, and welcoming everyone back: fans are allowed in for the first time since November 2019. A 6,500-strong crowd at the Cardiff City Stadium will get behind their heroes this evening, a rousing send-off ahead of the big one in Baku this time next week. Kick off is at 5pm BST.

He’s a very quick wit (and a notorious punner), and his love for cricket - stats especially - is just the right side of unhealthy obsession. He often repeats the same line at gigs: ‘Any cricket fans in today? Stick your hands up.... Great. Anyone not like cricket?... What the f*** IS WRONG WITH YOU?” Still makes me laugh. What I love is that this really is his dream job, and he’s a stand-up, podcaster, hosts the News Quiz, but really this is what he was born to do. TMS is a cuddlier, funnier, more brilliant place with him in it. And that’s the best thing, really.” </p> <p>Agreed. In the last decade or two there has been a lot of talk about modernising TMS, yoofspeak and all that.

I think a wise approach would be a fine, ban for a couple of Tests, and some form of meaningful engagement with the communities he disparaged, perhaps a combination of coaching and restorative-justice-style conversation, so he can understand the negative impact of his words and channel it into something positive.”</p> <p>I think that’s what will happen. I’ll be very surprised if he plays the second Test, which is important because it’s the last time this summer that the IPL bowlers will be unavailable. I suspect he’ll play at some stage next summer, but it’s not beyond the realms that he becomes the strangest of all one-Test wonders.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-06-05T14:50:32.236Z\">at 3.50pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-60bb8cd08f082ac930aeb36c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-05T14:43:13.576Z\">3.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>94th over: England 239-9 (Burns 107, Anderson 0) </strong>Burns celebrates his century by waving a full toss from Wagner down the ground for four.

Without holding people to account how else are we supposed to deter them? I am not sure standing back and letting boys be boys is the right way.

Sorry, this message had mutated into a ranting stream of consciousness; I’m going to have a lie down and a gin.” Ha. </p> <p>That’s a rant to relish, but perhaps putting a bit too much weight on the old career average.

Slow, slowish, quick, then quicker still, it all builds to the final act, the shoot-out on the fifth afternoon. Well, not this one. It has marched to the beat of a different drum: super-slow, super-quick, non-existent. Following yesterday’s wash-out, more than half the playing time has already elapsed, and we’ve only had an innings and a bit. The draw is such a hot favourite that if you decide to back it, you’ll have to shell out a tenner for every £3 you stand to win. </p> <p>If you are a betting person, the horse to back is surely New Zealand. Put a fiver on them and you could win £23. The rain, coming on top of Devon Conway’s dream debut, has left Kane Williamson in the driving seat. </p> <p>England, resuming on 111 for 2 and missing all their all-rounders (Stokes, Buttler, Woakes, Curran), could easily be bowled out for 250. That would take about half the day, leaving the other half for the New Zealanders to extend their lead. They could rattle up 200 by noon tomorrow, to hand England a target of about 330 in 80 overs. </p> <p>In a parallel universe, England would race to 450, bowl NZ out for 160, and win by eight wickets. All Joe Root would have to do is make 180 and then grab one of his cheap five-fors. Stranger things have almost happened.</p> <p>Play starts at 11am, as ever – the extra eight overs in the day, if we get them, will be tacked on at the end. See you shortly. <br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-06-05T09:19:36.601Z\">at 10.19am BST</time></p>  </div>","wordcount":"8452","firstPublicationDate":"2021-06-05T09:16:14Z","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2021-06-05T18:32:24Z","liveBloggingNow":"false","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/p/hktcv","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/0fc14a7c35223c72171096e6f53da89859428f46/0_62_5472_3283/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","isLive":"true","bodyText":"That’s it for today’s blog, though Ali Martin’s report will appear soon, as if by magic. Tim and I will be back tomorrow, so please join us then. Ta-ra! 30th over: New Zealand 62-2 (Latham 30, Wagner 2) Anderson’s final over is comfortably defended by Wagner, and that’s the end of day four. England were in serious trouble at 140 for six, still 238 runs behind, but they fought back excellently with both bat and ball. Rory Burns made an outstanding 132, and there were runs and wicket for the impressive Ollie Robinson. England bowled superbly in the final session and New Zealand couldn’t get away. New Zealand are the only team who can win the game, but the draw is the strong favourite. 29th over: New Zealand 62-2 (Latham 30, Wagner 2) Robinson seams another beauty past Wagner’s outside edge. He gets through his over quickly, which means there will be time for one more tonight. Wagner gets a single off the last ball to keep the strike, and Robinson finishes an outstanding day’s work: 42 with the bat, 9-5-8-2 with the ball. 28th over: New Zealand 61-2 (Latham 30, Wagner 1) We should have time for one more over after this one from Anderson, which means 10 of the scheduled 98 will be lost. That and New Zealand’s scoring rate means that England will have to do something exceptional if they are to embarrass themselves and lose this match. 27th over: New Zealand 59-2 (Latham 28, Wagner 1) Robinson now has figures of 8-4-7-2, and I’m mildly in awe of his performance since those disgusting tweets emerged. It’s bad enough to be publicly shamed; it must be even worse when you know you deserve every last bit of it, and you don’t have the option of going to ground until it blows over. It would destroy most of us, yet if anything it has made Robinson play even better. 26th over: New Zealand 58-2 (Latham 27, Wagner 1) I said earlier that Ollie Robinson could potentially become a one-cap wonder. Yeah, I think we can forget that one. 25th over: New Zealand 58-2 (Latham 27, Wagner 1) Neil Wagner has come in as nightwatchman. That was so impressive from Robinson, not just the bowling but also his awareness. Nobody else really appealed for the LBW, but he was desperate to review it. I think Root agreed out of sympathy, rather than because he thought it was it. He’s out! It was hitting the top of leg stump and Williamson has gone, having been worked over magnificently by Ollie Robinson. ANOTHER REVIEW! Robinson has another huge shout for LBW against Williamson next ball. It’s turned down but Joe Root decides to risk England’s last review. I think this will be umpire’s call, so not out. Ollie Robinson traps Kane Williamson LBW with a big nipbacker, just like he said he would before the game - but it’s overturned on review. There was a very thin inside edge, though Williamson didn’t know that. He reviewed in the hope that it was bouncing over the stumps. 24th over: New Zealand 57-1 (Latham 27, Williamson 1) The ball has gone out of shape and is going to be changed. When play resumes, Williamson gets off the mark from his 16th delivery. New Zealand’s lack of attacking intent is surprising, though I suspect it’s mainly due to the quality of England’s bowling. 23rd over: New Zealand 55-1 (Latham 26, Williamson 0) New Zealand get four leg-byes when Robinson strays onto Latham’s pads. Latham then drives a single down the ground to leave Robinson with figures of 6-4-5-1. Since you asked, That was Helenio Herrera’s dream formation, although the 1 was optional. “As ever, Millings’ Unfulfilled Promise XI is spot on, with Hick at No. 11 genius,” says Simon McMahon. “Ramprakash could be twelfth man. Stuart Broad will have more Test runs than both of them before the end of the summer. I’m not quite sure what that says about him, or them, or English cricket in the 90s, or today, but it must say something…” That’s another cracking statistic. Mind you, Shane Warne scored more runs than Keith Miller, and he fulfilled every last bit of his potential, so it’s not just an England thing. 22nd over: New Zealand 50-1 (Latham 25, Williamson 0) James Anderson replaces the relatively expensive Mark Wood (4-0-17-0). His first ball is flashed uppishly for four by Latham, not far wide of Burns at backward point. Despite that boundary, England have done really well to keep New Zealand in check this evening. 21st over: New Zealand 43-1 (Latham 18, Williamson 0) Another maiden from Robinson, this time to Williamson. His figures are 5-4-4-1, which sounds like Jose Mourinho’s dream formation. 20th over: New Zealand 43-1 (Latham 18, Williamson 0) The umpire Michael Gough gives Wood an official warning for running on the pitch in his follow through. Wood continues round the wicket, at least for now, and Latham slaps a short ball past gully for four. 19th over: New Zealand 39-1 (Latham 14, Williamson 0) A wicket maiden from Robinson, who now has match figures of 32-9-75-5. He also made a useful 42 with the bat. It’s been a uniquely bittersweet Test debut. Conway’s debut has been an unmitigated triumph. He made 223 runs from 411 deliveries, the fifth highest match total on debut - and, as Tim points out, he was not dismissed by a bowler until that 411th delivery. Ollie Robinson roars with delight after bowling Devon Conway. It was another really good delivery, which jagged back off the seam, took the inside edge and trimmed the bails. He’s a serious bowler this lad. 18th over: New Zealand 39-0 (Latham 14, Conway 23) Michael Gough has another look at Wood’s followthrough from round the wicket. He must be close to an official warning. 17th over: New Zealand 34-0 (Latham 14, Conway 19) Latham is beaten by another cracking delivery from Robinson that moves a long way off the seam. Another maiden, his second in three overs. It looks like New Zealand are going to bat normally tonight and then assess the match situation in the morning. 16th over: New Zealand 34-0 (Latham 14, Conway 19) A misfield from Lawrence, I think, gives Latham an extra run. Wood’s second over ends with a spectacular delivery that cuts Conway in half and just misses the inside edge. That’s drinks. “My sincere apologies to Brad and Brian McMillan, though I’m not sure who’d be more insulted,” writes Guy Hornsby. “I was busy checking the spelling of the surname so diligently that I subconsciously crick-o-corrected it to the burly South African legend. I’m sure Andy would’ve made a pun out of it. Yours, red-facedly, Sir Garfield Hornsby.” 15th over: New Zealand 29-0 (Latham 10, Conway 18) Conway flicks Robinson, who has switched to over the wicket, through square leg for four. He plays that shot so stylishly, with a flamingo flourish. Robinson responds smartly to beat Conway twice in three deliveries. 14th over: New Zealand 25-0 (Latham 10, Conway 14) Mark Wood is on for Stuart Broad, who bowled some jaffas in his spell of 6-1-9-0. Like Robinson, he is having problems with his follow through from round the wicket. Unlike Robinson, he doesn’t start with a maiden: a short ball is pulled round the corner for four by Latham. 13th over: New Zealand 21-0 (Latham 6, Conway 14) Ollie Robinson replaces James Anderson, who bowled an excellent spell of 6-1-11-0. He starts around the wicket to the left-handers, and after two balls Richard Kettleborough checks his follow through. That was a bit of a problem for Robinson in the first innings. He starts his spell with a maiden. I know batting hasn’t been easy this evening, but I’m surprised New Zealand have been quite so watchful. 12th over: New Zealand 21-0 (Latham 6, Conway 14) More technical problems, sorry. You’re not missing much. 11th over: New Zealand 20-0 (Latham 6, Conway 13) Latham is beaten by a jaffa from Anderson that straightens sharply and then bounces grotesquely. When Anderson goes a bit fuller, Latham drives pleasantly down the ground for a couple. New Zealand lead by 123. “Glad to see Conway is well on his way to becoming a one-innings wonder,” says Ian Copestake. “Have at thee fate.” 10th over: New Zealand 18-0 (Latham 4, Conway 13) Conway gets his first boundary, flicking Broad classily past midwicket. “Rob,” says Brian Withington. “Would the Mac Millings XI of broken dreams be coached by Peter One Moores Time? Brutal choice between Hick and Ramprakash for no. 11 slot btw.” Only Millings knows, but personally I’d give the job to John Wrong or maybe Dav Whatless. 9th over: New Zealand 11-0 (Latham 4, Conway 9) That really was a stinker of a review. CONWAY IS NOT OUT! There was an inside edge, so England are down to their last review. The ball pitched miles outside leg stump as well. That aside, he was plumb. ENGLAND REVIEW FOR LBW! Anderson implores Richard Kettleborough to give Conway out LBW. England have two reviews left - and Root chooses to go upstairs. He may soon regret that decision. 8th over: New Zealand 11-0 (Latham 3, Conway 7) Conway is having a torrid time. He survives a biggish LBW appeal from Broad, who doesn’t bother arguing for a review. Turns out it was umpire’s call on height. A flamingo flick brings Conway a single later in the over, and hints that he may have had enough of being a punchbag for Broad. The over ends with a clever offcutter from Broad that just misses the off stump as Latham offers no stroke. “Hello again Rob,” says Brad Mcmillan. “I sometimes wonder whether Brian would have been a more appropriate name for me, but I also wonder whether what little success I had with foreign girls on holiday as a teenager was because my name is actually Brad. Either way, I’ll forgive Guy Hornsby because he improved my original comment on Andy Zaltzman by mentioning the pun expertise and, well, because he’s Guy Hornsby.” Or Gary, as you should have called him. 7th over: New Zealand 10-0 (Latham 3, Conway 6) “After getting frustrated at England’s batting handing the initiative to New Zealand, I’m going to attempt to cheer myself up by jumping ship now, and watching Wales v Albania,” says Matt Dony. “I have a sneaking suspicion it might not be 100% successful. I’ll probably be back soon enough. And, whenever I do come back, I imagine Conway will be batting.” 6th over: New Zealand 8-0 (Latham 1, Conway 6) An LBW shout is caught in the throat when Conway gets a late inside-edge, and then he is rapped on the glove by another nasty delivery from Broad. He and Anderson have been superb with the new ball, reminding us that attack can be the best form of defence in the field. Latham and particularly Conway have a job on to survive, never mind score runs. ANOTHER REVIEW FOR CAUGHT BEHIND! Conway is beaten on the inside by a beauty from Broad, who thinks there might have been an inside edge. He persuades Joe Root to review, and those with experience of Stuart Broad and DRS will have an idea what happens next. Replays show Conway missed it by a long way, so this time England do lose a review. 5th over: New Zealand 8-0 (Latham 1, Conway 6) “Dearest Rob,” lies Mac Millings. “In light of your heartbreaking admission that Andy Zaltzman is ‘the man I dreamed of becoming’, please allow me to introduce my all-time Unfulfilled Promise XI: Rory Burnsout Cyril Washedup Has-been Hameed CouldaBeenAContender Sehwag David Capable Brett Likelee Lost Buttler Unfulfillip DeFreitas Prospect Utseya Prodigeetan Patel Graeme Hick LATHAM IS NOT OUT! Anderson got one to straighten sharply from round the wicket. Latham played across the line and there was a noise before the ball went through to Bracey. Joe Root reviewed with one second remaining, but replays showed the ball missed the outside edge and hit the back pad. It was actually very close to LBW, umpire’s call on point of contact, so England keep their review. ENGLAND REVIEW FOR CAUGHT BEHIND AGAINST LATHAM 4th over: New Zealand 5-0 (Latham 1, Conway 3) The new ball is doing plenty. Conway shoulders arms to a ball that lifts sharply and almost hits him in the armpit; then he is beaten, feeling for a lovely delivery that moves away off the seam. Conway nods respectfully at Broad. 3rd over: New Zealand 3-0 (Latham 0, Conway 2) Conway pulls his hand off the bat handle after being surprised by a bit of extra bounce, this time from Anderson. It’s been a quiet start to the innings, just three runs from three overs. “What’s the plan now for NZ?” says Ruth Purdue. “Assess the pitch a few overs and then tee off?” Yep, I guess so. This hasn’t been the easiest pitch on which to score quickly, though, so I don’t think it will be a sixfest. 2nd over: New Zealand 1-0 (Latham 0, Conway 1) Stuart Broad gets one to lift extravagantly outside Conway’s off stump. There have been enough hints of spin and uneven bounce to make New Zealand think they could force a fourth-innings collapse and win the game. “Hi Rob, from the 15:45 Leeds to Manchester,” says Guy Hornsby. “Can I vociferously second Brian McMillan? I’m a big Andy Zaltzman fan, ever since his early days of the brilliant Bugle, and I’ve been lucky enough to see him live a few times in stand-up. He’s a very quick wit (and a notorious punner), and his love for cricket - stats especially - is just the right side of unhealthy obsession. He often repeats the same line at gigs: ‘Any cricket fans in today? Stick your hands up.... Great. Anyone not like cricket?... What the f*** IS WRONG WITH YOU?” Still makes me laugh. What I love is that this really is his dream job, and he’s a stand-up, podcaster, hosts the News Quiz, but really this is what he was born to do. TMS is a cuddlier, funnier, more brilliant place with him in it. And that’s the best thing, really.” Agreed. In the last decade or two there has been a lot of talk about modernising TMS, yoofspeak and all that. Zaltzman had modernised it in a far subtler way, and without compromising the spirit of the thing. Zaltzman and Brian Johnston is one of the great fantasy commentary teams. 1st over: New Zealand 0-0 (Latham 0, Conway 0) It will be interesting to see how Devon Conway bats here. His 200 was a classical opener’s innings, but he also has a spectacular white-ball record so he has the ability to set up a declaration. For now Tom Latham is on strike to James Anderson, who starts with a maiden. The players are back on the field. There are still 37 overs to bowl today, so New Zealand should be well ahead by the close. “Hi Rob,” says Brad Mcmillan. “‘Twas indeed a great stat from Andy Zaltzman. I think it’s worth dwelling on him for a moment, not just to ponder his breathtaking stats-work, but his general passion for the game and, for my money, his perfection of the art of gallows humour. Appreciate his comedy isn’t for everyone, but he’s one of the quickest, funniest people I’ve ever heard, and there can surely be no doubt he’s been an absolutely brilliant addition to the BBC coverage.” As well as the one-liners and killer stats, there’s such an infectious joy to his work. He has redefined the role of the statto. Or, to put it another way, he’s the man I dreamed of becoming. Tea The innings break will today double up as a tea break. See you in 15 minutes. New Zealand lead by 103 runs They still have a chance of winning this game, and should be able to leave England with around 70 overs to survive tomorrow. It would have been a lot more but for that terrific innings from Rory Burns: 132 from 297 balls with 16 fours and one six. Tim Southee returns to the attack and needs only one ball to end the innings. Burns wafts outside off and gets a thin edge through to the keeper. He falls one short of his highest Test score, while Southee ends with admirable figures of six for 43. He’s a class act. In other news... 101st over: England 275-9 (Burns 132, Anderson 8) Anderson tries to reverse sweep Santner and almost drags the ball onto his stumps. Later in the over he hammers a long hop through the covers for four, which stirs the crowd and brings up an unlikely fifty partnership. This has been a fine comeback from 140 for six. “Is Burns the first England Test opener to score three centuries since Alastair Cook?” asks Tom van der Gucht. He is indeed. Compton, Sibley and Jennings all have two. 100th over: England 267-9 (Burns 130, Anderson 2) Still no pictures I’m afraid, but I can report that Burns a) survived a tight review for LBW and b) swept Wagner for six next ball. On an individual and team level, this really has been a mighty innings. Stat of the day, possibly the year 100th over: England 261-9 (Burns 124, Anderson 2) We’re having a few technical problems, apologies for that. I can’t be sure as the picture is coming and going, but I think New Zealand have just reviewed an LBW appeal against Rory Burns. It looked like it was missing leg. 99th over: England 261-9 (Burns 124, Anderson 2) Kane Williamson brings on Mitchell Santner to replace Kane Williamson. Anderson survives another over without too much trouble. This is the second irksome tenth-wicket partnership of the match after Devon Conway and Neil Wagner added 40 on the second day. “Wasn’t in your shift, but Tom van der Gucht’s Buttler rant might hold more weight if his career renaissance in Tests hadn’t started with some key defensive efforts against India (when Sam Curran got man of the series),” says Jimmy Ainsworth. “He showed real character, far more than England’s top order did today. And then bringing Bairstow into it... one of England’s greatest ODI batsmen for sure, but he’s spent the last three years in Tests moaning about not getting picked while forgetting where his stumps are. A lovely tribute act from poor James Bracey today, sadly.” I used to get in a tizz about Bairstow’s Test career, all that unfulfilled promise, but then I started to appreciate that England effectively swapped a good Test batsman for an all-time great one-day opener. It was a worthwhile trade. 98th over: England 261-9 (Burns 124, Anderson 2) Burns continues the post-century merriment, flicking Wagner over backward square for four. Since reaching his hundred he has scored 24 from 20 balls. 97th over: England 257-9 (Burns 120, Anderson 2) Kane Williamson brings himself into the attack, and starts with a dismal off-side wide. Burns misses a reverse sweep, with the ball slipping past Watling for a couple of byes, and then takes a single off the fifth ball. Anderson survives his one delivery without alarm. 96th over: England 253-9 (Burns 119, Anderson 2) Anderson elevates Wagner’s blood pressure with a jaunty shot behind square for two. He survives a full over, which means Burns will be on strike against Jamieson. England trail by 125. 95th over: England 251-9 (Burns 119, Anderson 0) Burns is letting his hair down. He pulls Jamieson for four, a sweetly timed stroke, steers another to third man and then laces a gorgeous cover drive to the fence. It’s not often that Kyle Jamieson goes for three boundaries in an over, not in Test cricket anyway. From the start of play to the arrival of the No11 Anderson, Burns scored 32 from 128 balls. Since then he has hit 28 from 15. “I’ve devoted quite a lot of time to mulling over the whole Robinson situation,” says Rob Wolf Petersen. “My view is that, ideally, the ECB would strike a balance between acknowledging the seriousness of the offence and recognising that it occurred a long time ago. I think a wise approach would be a fine, ban for a couple of Tests, and some form of meaningful engagement with the communities he disparaged, perhaps a combination of coaching and restorative-justice-style conversation, so he can understand the negative impact of his words and channel it into something positive.” I think that’s what will happen. I’ll be very surprised if he plays the second Test, which is important because it’s the last time this summer that the IPL bowlers will be unavailable. I suspect he’ll play at some stage next summer, but it’s not beyond the realms that he becomes the strangest of all one-Test wonders. 94th over: England 239-9 (Burns 107, Anderson 0) Burns celebrates his century by waving a full toss from Wagner down the ground for four. The speed with which the pecking order of the England batsmen changes is fascinating, especially as we’re in an Ashes year. Before this Test Burns was arguably 7th or 8th on the list; now he’s 3rd or 4th. That’s an outstanding effort from Burns on his return to the side. He edged Wagner to third man and pegged it back for a second. It’s his third Test century, his second against New Zealand, and it has ensured he won’t be the one missing out when Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler return. 93rd over: England 230-9 (Burns 98, Anderson 0) With Anderson at the crease, Burns decides it’s time to make a mad dash for his century. He cuts Jamieson for two then pulls the next ball for four. Burns was almost caught by the deep midwicket, who ran in and dived forward, but the ball bounced short and then went past him to the boundary. A single takes him to 98 and leaves Anderson with two balls to survive. He does. “I find myself like King Ethelred utterly unready to follow yet more forlorn English sporting pursuit of bang adequacy,” says Ian Copestake. “And then there’s these Test matches!” 92nd over: England 223-9 (Burns 91, Anderson 0) Burns has scored more slowly today - 32 from 128 balls. This is anything but a criticism - he and Ollie Robinson have taken some useful time out of the game. Neil Wagner vs Stuart Broad was never going to be dull. Broad pings a short ball from Wagner in the crowd - but he’s cleaned up by a fuller inswinger next ball. Wagner tests the burstability of his blood vessels, screaming with angry delight and clenching his fist towards Broad. 91st over: England 216-8 (Burns 90, Broad 4) Burns misses a hook at Jamieson, who has changed ends, and is clonked on the helmet for the second time since lunch and the fifth time in his Test career. That means a break in play for another concussion check, but he’s fine to continue. Burns then survives an optimistic shout after being hit in the box but an outswinger. Too high, probably pitched outside leg. A clip off the pads takes him into the nineties. Ashes department He’s batting at No3, which is a smart move if he wants to get back in the Test team. 90th over: England 214-8 (Burns 89, Broad 3) Neil Wagner replaces Jamieson, and his first over includes an LBW review and a dropped catch. Burns was the batter on both occasions. The LBW appeal was far too high but the catch should have been taken. Burns fenced a lifter to second slip, where Southee spilled a fairly sharp chance to his right. The ball deflected towards the first slip Ross Taylor, who threw out his left hand but couldn’t hold on. 89th over: England 212-8 (Burns 88, Broad 2) Thanks Tim, hello everyone. Burns inches closer to a hundred, pulling Southee’s first ball for a single, and that’s your lot. And with that, I’m handing over to the great Rob Smyth. Thanks for your company and correspondence, and sorry not to get round to all de emails about Bill Hargreaves’ XI. See you tomorrow. 88th over: England 211-8 (Burns 87, Broad 2) Broad hooks in the air, giving Burns a heart attack, but the ball lands safely. Meanwhile the Robinson debate continues. “Richard Horrocks’ take is somewhat short-sighted,” says Faradh Maharoof. “It’s a contradictory and convenient take to excuse bad behaviour. If the alternative is just a slap on the wrist, then how do we expect anyone to learn? Yes, those tweets were from an age ago but finding an effective way to hold him accountable is important – at the very least it sends a strong message that racism and sexism is inexcusable. Without holding people to account how else are we supposed to deter them? I am not sure standing back and letting boys be boys is the right way. Ollie was a young adult after all – and fully capable of making a judgement on what he was writing. And if he is really sorry and has really matured as an adult, why didn’t he apologise at any point over the past nine years before his England debut? “Giving people the chance to learn and grow is all well and good, but as the ECB and FIFA have shown us, it’s one thing to talk about learning from racism, and entirely another thing to hold people accountable and drive change. I’d bet one of those is better at deterring than the other.” 87th over: England 209-8 (Burns 86, Broad 1) Broad takes a quick single to get off the mark, which is more than a few others have managed in this innings. 86th over: England 208-8 (Burns 86, Broad 0) Jamieson now has 3 for 62, good stuff given that he struggled with the slope at first. He’s a very interesting bowler – halfway from Tony Greig to Courtney Walsh. 85th over: England 207-8 (Burns 86, Broad 0) Before the wicket, Burns showed that he wasn’t merely OK: that bang on the head seems to have brought back his timing, which had been missing for hours. He cracked Southee square for four to take England past 205, so this is now their highest score in eight Test innings. Mark Wood gets an inside edge, and England go back to collecting ducks. Southee has the taste for bouncers now and Burns ducks into one. It doesn’t look serious, he’s up and chatting, but the concussion checks need to be made, so the umpires call for drinks. The hour since lunch has belonged to England, but New Zealand are still well on top of the match. A bouncer, a hook, an easy catch at fine leg. Well bowled Southee, who has yet another five-for, and another line on the honours board. And well batted Ollie Robinson, who showed touches of class and bags of character. 83rd over: England 203-6 (Burns 82, Robinson 42) A single to each batsman off Jamieson. “Robinson and Archer on the same team?” says Repugned on Twitter. “Interesting nets.” Well, yes, if they didn’t already open the bowling together for Sussex. 82nd over: England 201-6 (Burns 81, Robinson 41) Burns, facing Southee, skies a pull, but gets away with it as the ball bisects two fielders and plops into the turf. A question from Nick Way. “Could Bill Hargreaves’ team also include La Buschagne?” 82nd over: England 200-6 (Burns 80, Robinson 41) Kyle Jamieson joins Southee, but he can’t make anything happen either on this slow pitch. Robinson, with his sensible head back on, waits for the bad ball and cuts it for four to bring up the 200. 81st over: England 195-6 (Burns 79, Robinson 37) Robinson is getting a bit cocky, dancing down the pitch to Southee, so the next ball is a bouncer, to sober him up. Southee finds some swing, as ever, but not the magic touch of this morning. 80th over: England 194-6 (Burns 78, Robinson 37) That’s bad luck on Santner, who will presumably not be seen for some time. It’s now time, and Tim, for the new ball. Meanwhile Geoffrey Smith picks up on Bill Hargreaves’ query about putting together an XI of players called de, D’ and so on. “Will Mike DeNness do?” Ha. Burns gives Santner the charge, misses, slips, hands BJ Watling several hours to get rid of him – and he fumbles it! 79th over: England 192-6 (Burns 77, Robinson 36) After doing the necessary, Robinson is beginning to relax. He eases Wagner past gully like Chris Woakes on a good day, then punches past cover like a proper batsman. That’s the fifty partnership, and Robinson is responsible for two-thirds of it. 78th over: England 183-6 (Burns 77, Robinson 27) A good ball from Santner, drifting in and turning away as Robinson pokes forward at thin air. But Robinson is showing us what a strong character he is – four wickets when Broad took none, 27 runs when several others got none, and most of it achieved under a big black cloud. He’ll probably be banned for the next Test, and rightly so, but he will be back and his grit, along with Jofra Archer’s elbow, could hold the key to the Ashes. Robinson chips Santner over mid-on and runs two, to get England over the line – but not yet out of the woods. 77th over: England 178-6 (Burns 76, Robinson 24) One of the two runs comes along right away, albeit in uncertain fashion, as Robinson flaps at Wagner’s stock ball – the bouncer. Burns plays and misses again, this time with a prod at a length ball that holds its line. One run to save the follow-on. Three overs to the new ball, which explains why we’ve been seeing the supporting cast. 76th over: England 177-6 (Burns 76, Robinson 23) Robinson flicks Santner to leg – and flicks short leg’s trouser leg, but safely, as whoever it is doesn’t have time to get his hands down to his shin. Burns then plays a sweep and misses, outside off. Two needed! 75th over: England 175-6 (Burns 75, Robinson 22) Wagner continues, and even he may be wondering why. There’s heavy cloud cover – get a swinger on. Burns takes a leg-bye and Robinson tries some nice decisive leaves. He’s about halfway to proving that England do have an allrounder after all. “Re Robinson,” says Daniel King, “surely people can see the disconnect between standing in a Moment of Unity with anti-discrimination shirts on, and having to explain remarks which – however long ago – are the absolute antithesis of what the ECB is trying to achieve right now.” 74th over: England 174-6 (Burns 75, Robinson 22) Kane Williamson, who usually knows what he’s doing, seems to be at sea here. He takes de Grandhomme off, which makes sense, but brings Mitch Santner on, rather than Jamieson. Robinson keeps him out. Five still needed to see off the follow-on. 73rd over: England 174-6 (Burns 75, Robinson 22) Wagner to Burns: nothing to report, except a certain amount of dogged inelegance. 72nd over: England 174-6 (Burns 75, Robinson 22) A no-ball and another single off de Grandhomme, who has also prompted a thought from Bill Hargreaves. “Can’t we get a team together with the likes of Colin de Grandhomme, Bryson Dehambeau, Basil D’Oliveira, Phil DeFreitas, et al? It could have been presided over by good old Phil de Greek, except that he’s now passed into the hands of Old Father Time.” Bill, you’re speaking my language. But I suspect we’ll need to let in people called du as well as de, De and D’. Come back, Faf du Plessis, your people need you. 71st over: England 172-6 (Burns 74, Robinson 22) From the Pavilion end it’s Wagner, who hasn’t found his mighty mojo yet. Burns takes yet another single with a prod to leg. Southee is believed to be off the field. “The cricketing world would be a less lively place,” says Abhijato Sensarma, “without the Kiwi bowling attack operating in it. There is something charming yet off-putting about them, isn’t there? Wagner, Southee, even the absentee Boult – they are the kind of killers who go around assassinating batters with a smile on their face. They’re not full-blooded pacers, but it’s nice to see a collective of their kind be charming on the field as well.” 70th over: England 171-6 (Burns 73, Robinson 22) Robinson takes advantage of Williamson’s generosity, cutting for four and again for two, which leaves only eight needed to save the follow-on. Not even England can mess that up, can they? The players are back from lunch, and the ball is in the hands of Colin de Grandhomme, which is a bonus for England. Maybe Southee’s exhausted. “Is it necessary,” asks Richard Horrocks, “to keep talking about Robinson’s tweets? I still have elderly grandparents who grew up in (and probably engaged with) very racist attitudes. Should that be dragged up too? Punishing the lad won’t deter anyone, it will just make it that much harder to connect with hearts and minds. This isn’t about judgement and punishment, but getting people to understand and giving them the chance to learn and grow. How we respond to Robinson now sends a message out to others about how they too will be received. Robinson has owned his mistake. Is that not enough?” Two interesting comments have come in on England’s predicament. “All those counties, all those posh schools and all those academies,” says Gary Naylor on Twitter, “and England end up with this top seven.” We could spend the whole afternoon unpacking that sentence. And here’s Tom van der Gucht. “Root did seem to be getting ahead of himself with his aim to win all this summer’s Tests.” You’re telling me – that was a textbook blunder. “Unfortunately, with the exception of a few players, England are a bit of a middling side at the moment. The bowling is looking to be picking up, but when you compare the batting line-up with 2010, it’s not fit to lace the drinks of Strauss, Cook, Trott, KP, Colly, Bell and Prior. Now, the team is packed with callow rookies. I know we’re lacking Stokes and Buttler, but then again is that a big loss?” Yes! “Buttler seems to have spent his entire Test career built on potential and what he could achieve. But how many times has he turned the game around in Tests? He’s played 50 matches and still trails in Prior’s wake in terms of contributions. In fact, he trails in Bairstow’s wake when you compare their records batting down the order and keeping... Sorry, this message had mutated into a ranting stream of consciousness; I’m going to have a lie down and a gin.” Ha. That’s a rant to relish, but perhaps putting a bit too much weight on the old career average. Not many batsmen have averaged more than 35 in England over the past three years, with the Dukes ball and the seaming surfaces. Stokes has been phenomenal, on and off, and Buttler has been immense lately – when not being rotated. 68th over: England 164-6 (Burns 72, Robinson 16) And that’s luncheon. Robinson has done well to steady the ship, after threatening to scupper it with those terrible tweets. And Burns is still there, albeit so becalmed that he’s being outscored by a bowler making his debut. Like his opposite number Devon Conway, Burns has seen a lot of partners come and go. So England still need 15 to avoid the follow-on. And the morning belongs to Tim Southee, who showed up a gauche middle order with a spell of exemplary swing bowling. See you in half an hour. Meanwhile, why not sign up to The Spin, if you don’t already. And Graham Hardcastle has the latest county news: It was off the pad only, as Robinson had realised. You wait ages for a mistake from Michael Gough, and then he makes two in one morning. Off the spinner, Santner, at short leg. He reviews straight away, so maybe it’s not out... 67th over: England 164-6 (Burns 72, Robinson 16) One more to each batsman as England continue to get ’em in singles. The partnership has crept to 24 and could really do with adding another 15. 66th over: England 162-6 (Burns 71, Robinson 15) Just a single off Jamieson as the cameras find a pair of small boys in T-shirts, with their dad, I presume. They must be about 9 and 11 and are busy with a scorebook, one filling it in, the other keeping a close eye on him. That was me and my brother Charlie, with our mum, when New Zealand came here in 1973. Be warned, lads: you may both become cricket writers, and one of you could end up on the OBO. 65th over: England 161-6 (Burns 70, Robinson 15) Burns nudges a single off Wagner, who is pitching it up rather than bombing him, presumably because the bombs can bring boundaries. “Whiffs of 80s and 90s nostalgia,” says Colum Fordham, “as England embark on a trademark collapse and try admirably to set up a New Zealand victory AGAINST ALL ODDS. Though writing from a surprisingly Lords-like overcast Naples, I just heard from my brother Kit in London who has been down to the graveyard with his young sons to play a bit of cricket (interesting location, I know, but apt). One of my nephews made a six and out. I’m sure he was influenced by England’s callow young middle-order batsmen. My brother has just opened another can of cider to ease the pain.” As emails go, that’s more of a novella. 64th over: England 160-6 (Burns 69, Robinson 15) Robinson gets a touch too confident, wafting at a lifter from Jamieson with the bat dangling at 45 degrees – neither one thing nor the other. He’s then beaten on the inside edge as Jamieson gets the shape back in with which he started the proceedings today. Still 19 needed to avoid the follow-on, and Robinson may have to get most of them – as Mike Atherton points out, Rory Burns has made only 10 this morning, off 60 balls. The wheel is there to be grabbed if he can manage it. 64th over: England 160-6 (Burns 69, Robinson 15) Here is Wagner, whose bowling in this game hasn’t been quite as hot as his batting. Robinson greets him with another good shot, a clip for three. “Can we talk,” says Tom King, “about that terrible Jet advert played between overs? It’s as if they’re trying to find the least crickety sound possible.” I’ll have to take your word for it, Tom. Between overs, I’m so busy stringing a sentence together, I wouldn’t hear a clap of thunder. 63rd over: England 157-6 (Burns 69, Robinson 12) So we do get a bowling change, but instead of Wagner for de Grandhomme, it’s Jamieson for Southee. His extra height induces a wacky shot from Robinson, who steps away and slashes over the slips for four. He thus becomes the fourth Englishman to reach double figures in this innings. To celebrate, he plays a much better stroke, a back-foot glide to cover point that deserves more than a single. Here endeth the masterclass. 62nd over: England 151-6 (Burns 69, Robinson 7) de Grandhomme goes back to joining the dots. Time for a burst of Neil Wagner, surely. 61st over: England 151-6 (Burns 69, Robinson 7) Williamson seems to have decided to bowl Southee all day long. For a change he tries a bouncer, which Burns pulls crisply but only for a single. In the commentary box are Ian Ward and Rob Key, and Ward is scoffing at Key’s ignorance of the fact that the Lord’s floodlights bob up and down (they’re up now, even though the sky is largely blue). Key takes it very genially, so the attempt at one-upmanship rather backfires. 60th over: England 150-6 (Burns 68, Robinson 7) de Grandhomme concedes a few singles, for once, so England make it to a minor milestone. They need another 29 to see off the possibility of the follow-on. Here’s Richard O’Hagan again. “I know that there’s a lot of 90s nostalgia around at the moment – music reviews, Euro 96 reviews and so on – but England being thrashed by NZ was one memory I really didn’t want to revisit.” 59th over: England 147-6 (Burns 67, Robinson 5) Robinson plays his first decent shot, a firm push down the ground off Southee, which is saved by a diving stop from Kane Williamson. If he’d thought about it, Williamson might have let it trickle for four, to give Southee a few more goes at Robinson. Southee could afford to concede the extra run: his spell now stands at 11-6-18-3, and it may have won the match. 58th over: England 143-6 (Burns 66, Robinson 2) Burns needs to get a move on, but de Grandhomme isn’t the bowler you’d choose for that scenario. He keeps it tight apart from a big fat no-ball. Burns has only five from his last 30 balls, so the question now is whether he can take charge. “Just done a team sprint triathlon in Leeds (I know I know, anything to get out of the house),” says Guy Hornsby. “Checked my phone after the finish to a flurry of notifications. I thought ‘it can’t be the cricket’ but... Of COURSE IT CAN. I know we’re keen on a result but.... Oh England.” 57th over: England 142-6 (Burns 66, Robinson 2) One debutant gives way to another as Ollie Robinson comes in. His first Test has been a right old rollercoaster – four wickets and one disgrace, albeit from years ago. And he nearly gets a golden duck, just saving himself from a big LBW shout by getting an inside edge. Robinson can bat, but he hasn’t shown it yet – he gets off the mark with a leaden-footed squirt through the slips. This is riveting. Another duck! Poor Bracey’s first Test innings comes to a miserable end as Southee bends one back up the slope and the bat goes some way down the wrong line. England have lost three for none in 21 balls. It’s a classic English collapse, and they still need 39 to avoid the follow-on. 56th over: England 140-5 (Burns 66, Bracey 0) Time for a bowling change, as Jamieson takes a breather and Colin de Mullet comes on. It’s a maiden from him to Burns, and that’s drinks, with New Zealand well on top. England’s grown-ups have been fine, making 108 runs for once out, while the kids are all wrong – Sibley 0, Crawley 2, Pope 22, Lawrence 0. These ducks and twos won’t do: if you’re going to struggle, at least stick around for half an hour. “You see,” says Richard O’Hagan, “this is why England picked a top-order batter at number 7. It all makes sense now.” 55th over: England 140-5 (Burns 66, Bracey 0) And here comes James Bracey, on debut. Facing the demon Southee, he leaves one that’s a little too close for comfort, then traps a full ball in the crease like a footballer. But he’s survived five balls, which is three more than Lawrence managed. Southee’s spell now: 9-6-11-2, Timmy with a strong whiff of Jimmy. Another one! Southee sends down a piece of sheer temptation, in the form of a full outswinger. And Lawrence takes the bait, giving Colin de Grandhomme, at third slip, a catch so simple that he could have held it in his mullet. 54th over: England 140-4 (Burns 66, Lawrence 0) Dan Lawrence has come in, but has only faced one ball so far. He is England’s sixth specialist batsman, something that hardly ever happened under Ed Smith – who is having rather a good game, as absent friends often do. 53rd over: England 140-4 (Burns 66, Lawrence 0) Great stuff from Southee, whose spell has been impeccable: 8-5-11-1. “I wonder,” says David Reynolds, “if any of your readers might know what ails the overseas TMS feed. To begin with, the Youtube page for Day 4 produced no sound, and now the link for it has disappeared from the BBC Cricket page. In the meantime, this Middlesex man is hoping for oodles of Surrey runs today.” Yes, he’s gone! It was a very plumb plumb, and Southee knew it. Gough is not God after all. And Pope’s promising innings turns out to be a mere cameo. The only reason to think this is not out is that Michael Gough said so, and he is hardly ever wrong. 52nd over: England 140-3 (Burns 66, Pope 22) A glance from Pope, so he gets down the other end, the better to decide who it is that Jamieson really resembles. And finally we have a commanding shot from Burns, clipping for four in front of square. He could do with a hundred here after six consecutive Tests of diddly squat. 51st over: England 135-3 (Burns 62, Pope 21) After that flurry of runs, Southee decides a maiden is required, and Burns obliges. “Jamieson just offered up one cheeky grin too many,” says Robert Cookson, “and I realised that he has more than a passing resemblance to a youthful Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson. I’m done for the day.” Kyle Jamieson thus becomes the first person ever to be likened to both B Johnson and R Redford in the same morning. 50th over: England 135-3 (Burns 62, Pope 21) Burns takes a single off Jamieson, and Pope clips a blameless ball square for four. Ebony Rainford-Brent heard him taking guard and asking for middle-and-off, which enables a shot like that – but if he misses, playing a ball on middle stump with half a bat, he’ll be plumb. Intriguing stuff. 49th over: England 130-3 (Burns 61, Pope 17) Pope, freed from the shackles of Jamieson, spots a half-volley from Southee and creams it to the extra-cover boundary. That’s the shot of the morning, not that the bar is a high one. And then it’s trumped by an on-drive off a pretty good ball, swinging out from middle-and-leg. Pope is moving the game along at a good lick, which is just what it needs. “Jamieson has something of the Tremlett about him, don’t you think?” says Kevin Wilson. “Not super quick, about Anderson or Broad pace, but he just looks huge! A lovely, flowing action too. Broad is the same height more or less but wouldn’t intimidate me half as much as Jamieson would.” Broad, right now, only intimidates coaches and people called Warner. But with a bit of luck he’ll see himself being written off and get 6 for 20 in the second innings. 48th over: England 122-3 (Burns 61, Pope 9) Another four to Pope, another thick edge off Jamieson, but with a bit more control this time. Then we get the first single of the day, as Pope nudges to fine leg. Burns, facing Jamieson for the first time, is turned around and slammed on the back pad. There’s a big appeal but the ump reckons it’s too high. Ooh – umpire’s call. On this evidence Jamieson is much like Ollie Robinson, but even more effective, because taller and that bit more experienced. 47th over: England 117-3 (Burns 61, Pope 4) With the ball moving sideways, Rory Burns – who does plenty of that himself – looks like a wicket waiting to happen. But he’s a fighter and he gets off the mark for the morning with a shovel for two off Southee. 46th over: England 115-3 (Burns 59, Pope 4) We have some runs! Four of them, to Ollie Pope, but off a thick edge – a bit of a grope from Pope. And next ball he plays and misses. How many do England need to avoid the follow-on? Another 60 or so. 45th over: England 111-3 (Burns 59, Pope 0) At the other end – running in from the Pavilion – it’s Tim Southee, and he too is swinging it round corners. Rory Burns does well to keep him out. The England players have a new word emblazoned on their chests: cinch, which is exactly what this isn’t. “Good morning,” says John Starbuck. “At this rate, we might get a man carrying his bat after all, if Burns can retain his poise and do the business.” 44th over: England 111-3 (Burns 59, Pope 0) That’s a wicket maiden and a fabulous start from Jamieson, who is finding big swing as well as steep bounce. And he looks like Robert Redford on stilts. It’s the first ball and ... Joe Root is caught at first slip! Slight doubt over whether the catch was clean, but it was - well held Ross Taylor, and well bowled Kyle Jamieson. The shot was the classic fend, off the back foot, and England have lost their only experienced batsman. The players are out there, and the sun is not – though there’s plenty of blue in the sky. There is a rhythm to a Test match, a classic structure. Slow, slowish, quick, then quicker still, it all builds to the final act, the shoot-out on the fifth afternoon. Well, not this one. It has marched to the beat of a different drum: super-slow, super-quick, non-existent. Following yesterday’s wash-out, more than half the playing time has already elapsed, and we’ve only had an innings and a bit. The draw is such a hot favourite that if you decide to back it, you’ll have to shell out a tenner for every £3 you stand to win. If you are a betting person, the horse to back is surely New Zealand. Put a fiver on them and you could win £23. The rain, coming on top of Devon Conway’s dream debut, has left Kane Williamson in the driving seat. England, resuming on 111 for 2 and missing all their all-rounders (Stokes, Buttler, Woakes, Curran), could easily be bowled out for 250. That would take about half the day, leaving the other half for the New Zealanders to extend their lead. They could rattle up 200 by noon tomorrow, to hand England a target of about 330 in 80 overs. In a parallel universe, England would race to 450, bowl NZ out for 160, and win by eight wickets. All Joe Root would have to do is make 180 and then grab one of his cheap five-fors. Stranger things have almost happened. Play starts at 11am, as ever – the extra eight overs in the day, if we get them, will be tacked on at the end. See you shortly.","charCount":"47315","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/timdelisle\">Tim de Lisle</a> and <a href=\"profile/robsmyth\">Rob Smyth</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2021/jun/05/gareth-bales-arrival-livens-up-waless-draw-with-albania-in-friendly","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-05T18:03:23Z","webTitle":"Gareth Bale’s arrival livens up Wales’s draw with Albania in friendly","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/jun/05/gareth-bales-arrival-livens-up-waless-draw-with-albania-in-friendly","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2021/jun/05/gareth-bales-arrival-livens-up-waless-draw-with-albania-in-friendly","fields":{"headline":"Gareth Bale’s arrival livens up Wales’s draw with Albania in friendly","trailText":"Gareth Bale came on as a substitute as Wales drew 0-0 with Albania in friendly warmup for Euro 2020","byline":"Ben Fisher at Cardiff City Stadium","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"43fe5053ee6f5402882f6054ad788cf3d8eb81aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/43fe5053ee6f5402882f6054ad788cf3d8eb81aa/0_162_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gareth Bale carries the fight to Albania.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gareth Bale carries the fight to Albania.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Potts/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>A humdrum stalemate against a team ranked 66 in the world does not suggest any great success is on the horizon but Wales nevertheless received a hearty send-off for the European Championship.</p> <p>Aaron Ramsey started his first Wales game since October and Gareth Bale was a late substitute but a largely experimental side struggled to penetrate Albania for long spells.</p> <p>It was hardly a sparkling performance but key players managed to add to their match fitness in an occasionally spiky friendly, with the Liverpool full-back Neco Williams coming closest to finding a breakthrough late on.

Aaron Ramsey started his first Wales game since October and Gareth Bale was a late substitute but a largely experimental side struggled to penetrate Albania for long spells. It was hardly a sparkling performance but key players managed to add to their match fitness in an occasionally spiky friendly, with the Liverpool full-back Neco Williams coming closest to finding a breakthrough late on. He lashed a powerful shot at goal from 20 yards, forcing the Albania goalkeeper, Gentian Selmani, to shuffle to his left and unconvincingly palm clear. At the other end, Wayne Hennessey, who looks set to be backup to Leicester’s Danny Ward at Euro 2020, was untested on his 96th cap for his country. The returning ‘Red Wall’ were spread around all four sides of the stadium but 6,500 supporters nevertheless produced a rousing rendition of Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau before kick-off. The first-half performance that followed was pale. Wales lacked thrust going forward and defensively they were too easily flustered, with Chris Mepham, one of three players to start this game and the defeat to France on Wednesday, among those that appeared vulnerable. The Albania striker Rey Manaj easily shook off the Bournemouth defender after finding space between Mepham and Ben Davies but blasted over. Robert Page had hinted at using Aaron Ramsey further forward and he fielded the Juventus midfielder as a false nine, a tactic Wales look set to adopt in favour of a traditional striker. Harry Wilson shone in that role against Belgium in March and played there in midweek but Ramsey appeared lost and ended up gravitating towards more familiar midfield surroundings. Every now and then Ramsey floated into pockets of space but his teammates were not on the same wavelength. The first real sight of goal came when David Brooks picked out Ramsey from the left, with the latter flicking an effort off target. No wonder there was such a hearty reception for Kieffer Moore as the striker warmed up midway through the first half and, unsurprisingly, Page tweaked things at the interval, introducing Moore in place of Ethan Ampadu, another who looked rusty. Williams, available after the Football Association of Wales cleared him to play after his ludicrous red card against France, started at right wing-back. The second half was 45 seconds old when the arena fell eerily silent. Ardian Ismajli caught Ramsey on halfway and he stayed down clutching his leg for a minute before receiving medical treatment. Those in the stands, and presumably on the touchline, feared the worst but as Ramsey rose to his feet, there was a roar of relief and he continued seemingly untroubled. How Ramsey benefited from the arrival of Moore, who provided a welcome focal point. Before departing the pitch on the hour mark, along with Ben Davies and Joe Allen, who are also continuing to build fitness following injuries in preparation for Wales’s Group A opener against Switzerland, Ramsey dropped into the No 10 position he calls home. Wilson, Matthew Smith and Joe Rodon arrived as their replacements. Then came Bale to the warmest of ovations with 19 minutes to play. It was his name on supporters’ lips after 52 seconds. “Viva Gareth Bale,” they sang. Then it was “Wales, Golf, Madrid”, an explicit nod to the infamous flag that, it is fair to say, irked those in Spain. One of Bale’s first acts was to send a delicious, arcing cross into the box for Moore but the Cardiff striker could only glance straight at Selmani. Nevertheless, Moore gave Bale the thumbs-up and Wales went on to finish with a spring in their step.","charCount":"3769","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/ben-fisher\">Ben Fisher</a> at Cardiff City Stadium"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2021/jun/05/angry-protests-in-venice-at-shock-return-of-cruise-ships","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-05T18:00:16Z","webTitle":"Angry protests in Venice at shock return of cruise ships ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/05/angry-protests-in-venice-at-shock-return-of-cruise-ships","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/jun/05/angry-protests-in-venice-at-shock-return-of-cruise-ships","fields":{"headline":"Angry protests in Venice at shock return of cruise ships ","standfirst":"<p>Ban on huge vessels passing St Mark’s Square proves to be temporary after liner docks in city for first time in 17 months</p>","trailText":"Ban on huge vessels passing St Mark’s Square proves to be temporary after liner docks in city for first time in 17 months","byline":"Angela Giuffrida","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d6dd7e9368005da78210ec4e5b404cbe8edf0126\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6dd7e9368005da78210ec4e5b404cbe8edf0126/301_220_3372_2023/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The MSC Orchestra in the Giudecca canal in Venice last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The MSC Orchestra in the Giudecca canal in Venice where in 2019 a 13-deck vessel crashed into a wharf.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: JC Viens/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Anti-cruise ship campaigners in Venice claim they were “deceived” by the Italian government as hundreds protested against huge vessels docking in the historic city’s port on Saturday.</p> <p>Residents were caught by surprise on Thursday when a cruise liner sailed into the lagoon city for the first time since the pandemic began, despite prime minister Mario Draghi’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/25/cruise-ships-kept-away-st-marks-square-venice\" title=\"\">government declaring</a> that the ships would be banned from the historic centre.

Gromit says a lot just by raising one sardonic eyebrow.” John Chesworth, chair of the Preston Partnership and the Preston Towns Fund Board, described Parks as one of the town’s most famous living Prestonians and said it was great to celebrate his achievements with the sculpture. “We very much look forward to welcoming the duo to Preston and to inviting people to come into the city centre to visit them.”","charCount":"1904","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/rhi-storer\">Rhi Storer</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2021/jun/05/in-court-of-boris-johnson-no-room-for-scrutiny-by-judges","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-05T17:30:15Z","webTitle":"Scroungers, lefty lawyers... the Tories duck scrutiny by inventing enemies | Nick Cohen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/05/in-court-of-boris-johnson-no-room-for-scrutiny-by-judges","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/05/in-court-of-boris-johnson-no-room-for-scrutiny-by-judges","fields":{"headline":"Scroungers, lefty lawyers... the Tories duck scrutiny by inventing enemies","standfirst":"<p>Abiding by judicial oversight is alien to a government that acts as if it’s above the law</p>","trailText":"Abiding by judicial oversight is alien to a government that acts as if it’s above the law","byline":"Nick Cohen","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"53e828abb9edcf95aad1492ace826455fc4eaa7d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/53e828abb9edcf95aad1492ace826455fc4eaa7d/22_0_3456_2073/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The high court ruled that the standard of living at Napier barracks was ‘not adequate’ and criticised the ‘detention-like’ setting. \" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The high court ruled that the standard of living at Napier barracks was ‘not adequate’ and criticised the ‘detention-like’ setting. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>You cannot say anything coherent without generalising, and so, and to generalise, the British will lose their rights to challenge an over-mighty and underwhelming state because they hate foreigners more than they love political accountability.</p> <p>The Johnson administration knows that as long as it portrays asylum seekers as cheats arriving in the UK illegally and their solicitors as activist “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/20/attacks-lefty-lawyers-rule-of-law-boris-johnson-priti-patel\" title=\"\">lefty lawyers</a>”, tricking the trusting public into allowing scrounging aliens to remain on our island, it can end scrutiny of its abuses of power.</p> <p>Stopping accountability is, after all, its prime purpose.

Keaton Jennings was the master builder, crafting his first red-ball century since he made 146 not out for England against Sri Lanka in November 2018. After a couple of years in the wilderness, this season he has rediscovered both touch and brio. Away he chugged, putting on 19 runs in the first 45 minutes with Luke Wells, but there were occasional boulders as well as bricks, as skimming cover drives and gleaming late cuts were plucked from the level.</p> <p><strong>Yorkshire</strong> plugged away, throwing on Dom Bess, his baggy trousers and shaggy hair a sharp contrast to Jennings‚Äô ironed creases and buttoned cuffs. Yorkshire eventually got their hands on the new ball they had been after all day, and it tookonly five overs to make a breakthrough as Jennings was caught at first slip after a partnership of 175 with Wells. One became three as Wells, then Livingstone followed. But on Lancashire went. For a while it seemed they would try for maximum batting bonus points as Dane Vilas straight drove Steven Patterson for four, then dropped to one knee and pulled him behind square, and Bess was biffed for straight sixes, with Josh Bohannon reaching the scorers‚Äô box high in the media centre. But sense soon prevailed and the grind, grind, grind returned.</p> <p>A sixth wicket stand of 125 between Ryan ten Doeschate (55) and Adam Wheater (81) rescued <strong>Essex</strong> from an unbecoming 53 for five to finish the day with a towering lead at Chester-le-Street. <strong>Durham </strong>were earlier bowled out for 99; such was the haste of their demise that Simon Harmer didn‚Äôt even get to wrap his bowling fingers around the ball.</p> <p>Saif Zaib‚Äôs 64 helped <strong>Northants</strong> to a handy first-innings lead at Hove. After a post-tea wobble, Tom Haines and Ben Brown inched <strong>Sussex </strong>ahead.</p> <p>Lewis Hill and Callum Parkinson were the only players to make their mark on <strong>Leicestershire</strong>‚Äôs first innings of 136. Martin Andersson was too much for their middle order, picking up four for 27, his best figures for <strong>Middlesex</strong>.</p> <p>Hashim Amla continued to scatter his munificence at The Oval, finishing with 173, and <strong>Surrey </strong>473, thanks to a bit of hurry-up from Rikki Clarke and Sean Abbott. <strong>Gloucestershire</strong> must now bat out two days on a turning pitch, with Amar Virdi already in the wickets shortly before rain stopped play.</p> <p>A last wicket can-can of 52 for <strong>Warwickshire</strong> between Liam Norwell and Oliver Hannon-Dalby proved a morning irritation to <strong>Nottinghamshire </strong>on a day interrupted by showers. Norwell, who had frying-panned three sixes, then nipped in to remove England-bound Haseeb Hameed for 39, Ben Duckett and, later, Ben Slater for 77.</p> <p>Ed Barnard coaxed the tail into a morning wag with another handy innings, this time of 90, as <strong>Worcestershire </strong>reached 421. On a rain-interrupted afternoon, <strong>Derbyshire</strong> lost three wickets.</p> </div>   </div>","wordcount":"2503","commentCloseDate":"2021-06-01T09:36:51Z","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2021-05-29T09:36:51Z","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2021-05-29T15:18:20Z","liveBloggingNow":"true","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/p/htfg7","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/191966b618b1ac896cc3a02bc97e542d7d7c1621/0_233_4260_2557/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","isLive":"true","bodyText":"Fatly pleased to see Dillon Pennington‚Äôs 4-44 in Derbyshire‚Äôs first-innings, followed by the first wicket of Derbys‚Äôs second innings. Have been waiting for him to have a breakthrough match ever since watching him against Surrey at New Road in September 2018. Group One Riverside: Durham 99 all out and 126-3 v Essex 182 all out and 301 Durham need 259 to win Edgbaston: Warwickshire 341 all out and 95-1 v Nottinghamshire 297 New Road: Worcestershire 421 all out v Derbyshire 270 and 16-1 Group Two Grace Road: Leicestershire 136 v Middlesex 295 and 204-8 The Oval: Surrey 473 all out v Gloucestershire 158 and 28-0 Group Three Old Trafford: Lancashire 509-9dec v Yorkshire 159 and 28-0. Hove: Sussex 175 and 298 v Northants 256 and 35-1 Northants need 183 to win Ah. Vilas has plumped for a bit of Livingstone for the last over before tea. Will it be the spin twins twirling and gurning throughout the final session? Lyth and Kohler-Cadmore have negotiated this first part of their second innings with aplomb. Yorkshire 28-0, Lyth 15; KC 12. Tea scores to follow. Derby following on at Worcester; Gloucestershire following on at The Oval. And Northants need another 194 to win at Hove, they‚Äôve already lost Ben Curran for 10. Poor Curran, averaging 14 this season in his seven games. Not a bad record. By the way, Parky is on. Middlesex suffering a scuttle of wickets, losing three for five, including Handscomb for 36. Chris Wright 5-43. And Gloucestershire too are in deep trouble. Daniel Moriarty 5-56; Amar Virdi 3-46. Gloucestershire 158-9, no, make that 158 all out. Miles Hammond last man out for 77. They must gear up again, following-on, 315 behind. Durham lose a third wicket - 104-3 - a much better effort than the first innings, but too many wickets gone, too early in the day. The bowler, ten Doeschate, the batsman Lees. 281 more needed to win. Oh, Ben Brown! Sussex now 298-9, with him 95 not out - NO - make that 95 OUT! Sussex 298, five wickets for Simon Kerrigan (horray!). Northants need 217 to win. Would it be rude to suggest that laid-back Yorkshire look in no trouble at all? A fantastic rear-guard display by Sussex led by a century from Tom Haines and a nearly-ton from Ben Brown, who is 95 not out. Sussex 298-8, a lead of 216. Saqib Mahmood does a series of bouncy tuck jumps at the top of his long, long, run. That‚Äôs just showing off. OOoof, Lyth cuts, past a diving Danny Lamb at gully. A slightly risky air to that shot. Tom Bailey stands tall at the top of his run, quick and smooth. After one over, Yorkshire are 1-0 and everything suddenly has urgency and energy. This is the fourth time Lancashire have passed 500 in Roses matches and, remarkably, their second 509-9 declared . The first, I know you‚Äôll want to know, came in 1926. 47 overs of the day left. Mahmood is run out for 0 and Lancs declare. A lovely gesture by Patterson, who shakes Bohannon‚Äôs hand and then signals to his players to let Bohannon walk back first, 127 not out, and they all clap him off. The groundsman drapes the crease in a black cloth, a funereal spectre of things to come. They‚Äôre back on at Edgbaston, Warwickshire pocketing a 44-run first-innings lead. And they‚Äôre stepping on it, at OT. Declaration not far away. Tom Bailey slams Hill into the empty seats of the party stand... oh, ... and he‚Äôs been bowled trying to whallop a repeat shot. Lancashire 506-8 Dom Bess gets a consolation wicket, Lamb for 61, but the Lancashire declaration doesn‚Äôt come. We‚Äôre not sure what they‚Äôre waiting for - 500? Another Chester-le-Street lbw - this time Scott Borthwick to Sam Cook for 29. Durham 53-2 and the pitch misbehaving. Notts all out at Edgbaston, but they‚Äôve done well to pull themselves to within 44 of Warwickshire‚Äôs first innings. . Derbyshire have lost Hudson-Prentice for 25, Critchley hanging on for 61. Hammond still there at The Oval, on 61, but Gloucestershire are in rather a hole, now 129-7, 343 behind. And that‚Äôs the hundred! A first Roses hundred, the second first-class ton of his career, off 260 balls, ten fours and a six. He punches the air, whips off his helmet and raises his bat to his whooping teammates and, round the ground, to the clapping crowd. A cracking innings, slow, quick, quick, slow, which has taken Lancashire to an utterly dominant position. Nervous 99s for Bohannon.... And a great preview of the New Zealand series, which starts on Wednesday! No jacket required at lunch at Old Trafford. On my turn of the ground I saw a couple of 99‚Äôs gingerly making their way back to their seats, a man in an MCC blazer and matching face mask, and a good handful of children. Here are the Grahams, enjoying a family outing at OT for the first time post lockdown (though Peter has been here every day the match). Happy Birthday for Monday Kian and Zavi! Seat banging and mucho applause as Danny Lamb reaches his fifty with a single off Danny Brook. Off a 142 balls in a vital seventh-wicket partnership as Yorkshire just wait for the trials ahead. An email pops up from Andrew Benton: ‚ÄúEvery time I see your name I connect in my head to a film called Ptang Yang Kipperbang, which was on Channel 4 soon after it started broadcasting (40-odd years ago now). I saw it then, as a lad, then forgot about it. Finally I checked it out and am reminded it‚Äôs about cricket (!) and more, with John Arlott providing a commentary on the adolescent protagonists life. Perhaps recommended viewing for non-match days (or the Hundred, if that flops!)‚Äú Thank you Andrew! A lovely interview by Kevin Howells with Vic Marks on the radio now. Group One Riverside: Durham 99 all out and 47-1 v Essex 182 all out and 301 Edgbaston: Warwickshire 341 all out v Nottinghamshire 274-8 New Road: Worcestershire 421 all out v Derbyshire 193-5 Group Two Grace Road: Leicestershire 136 v Middlesex 295 and 125-4 The Oval: Surrey 473 all out v Gloucestershire 113-6 Group Three Old Trafford: Lancashire 439-6 v Yorkshire 159 all out Hove: Sussex 175 all out and 241-7 v Northants 256 all out And that is lunch, as a weary Yorkshire dawdle off the field. The Lancashire lead, 280. Scores to follow. Emma Lamb has reached her hundred, 107 not out, against Western Storm; Peter Handsomb and John Simpson at the crease for Middlesex, who have lost three this morning, but have a healthy padding of 284 over Leicestershire With an over to go, Bohannon needs another eight for his century, Danny Lamb ten for his fifty. Lancs 439-6. A third wicket to Simon Kerrigan at Hove- Tom Haines out for a marvellous 103. And Gloucestershire in deep trouble at The Oval! Brathwaited 38, Hammond 44 not out, but a sorry tale otherwise of noughts and ones as the spinners weave their web : three for Virdi, two for Moriarty. Hammond not out 44 and Tattersall, on loan from Yorkshire, one. And, according to the commentators, the pitch isn‚Äôt even spinning yet. If anyone is interested, these were the thoughts of Steven Patterson yesterday. Incidentally, we think that if Derbyshire make 200, Yorkshire will have the lowest number of batting points in the country. ‚ÄúIt was an horrendous start for us (with the bat). But fair play to them, they‚Äôve played good cricket throughout and have not let us back in the game. We now find ourselves right up against it. ‚ÄúI thought Keaton Jennings and Luke Wells showed us, in a sense, how to bat on a good surface. When you get the opportunity, make it count. ‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt score at a particularly quick rate at any stage, but they made it hard work for us and ground us down. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt question the lads character and effort today. It‚Äôs a good surface and hard to get wickets on. ‚ÄúTo go at two and a half an over for the first 120 overs is a good effort and a testament to the bowlers skills. But, at the end of the day, we can‚Äôt keep expecting the bowlers to pull us out of trouble.‚Äù Happy to see Barnard and Pennington in the wickets at New Road - Derby in a bit of pickle at 148-5. Not to worry Yorkshire, but Dom Bess is just starting to find a bit of a twist on the pitch. Notts continuing to bleed wickets, now 237-7, but Sussex are on a roll. Tom Haines 94 not out, Ben Brown 54 not out. A partnership of 96 which has given Sussex a sniff of a chance of fighting for a place in Division One. Their lead over Northants, 114. Thanks to Romeo for pointing out that I‚Äôd filed some absolute gibberish about live streams (he was a lot more polite!). I‚Äôll try again: Some amazing live stream data: on day one of the Roses match, Lancashire picked up 159,000 hits via facebook and youtube, and 153,000 on day two. This is compared with an average of 150,000 over a four day match. Plus more watching on Sky. The Roses, it seems, still captures the imagination. Durham, I‚Äôm afraid to report, have lost their first wicket on their quest to make large number of runs to win. Cameron Bancroft bowled by Jamie Porter for four. Durham 9-1. Tim Bresnan pockets Joe Clarke for 61 as Nottinghamshire reach 218-5. Danny Lamb (23 not out) is not the only member of his family batting today, his sister Emma is 55 not out for Thunder against Western Storm. Essex‚Äôs innings has disintegrated with a familiar flow: another bowled and another lbw, both to Ben Raine, who finishes with 5-64. Durham need 385 to win, with five and a half sessions to get them. Aha. Some amazing live stream data: on day one of the Roses match, Lancashire picked up 159,000 hits, and 153,000 on day two. This is compared with an average of 150,000 over a four day match. Plus more watching on Sky. The Roses, it seems, still captures the imagination. And a gorgeous straight drive from Bohannon off Olivier, pushes Lancashire towards 400. Bohannon‚Äôs fifty came at last - 149 balls, seven fours, 1 six - he‚Äôs a real block or biff it boy. And I should probably mention, for those of you not watching the live streams, that the players are still taking regular sanitisation breaks. Notts have just lost their first wicket,Lyndon James for four, and Joe Clarke has passed his fourth fifty of the season. Notts 202-4. Here, we‚Äôre still waiting for Josh Bohannon to get the two runs to reach his fifty. Voices in the press box saying: ‚ÄúBohannon for England!‚Äù A slow start here, a bit of prodding and poking with a fair scattering of members on an almost humid day. Some cracking reads in the paper today: and one that I KNOW will appeal to County Blog readers: Good morning! It‚Äôs the last Saturday in May and county cricket is in bloom everywhere. Some tight games today, results could flourish at Hove and Chester-le-Street ,while Lancashire, Surrey and Middlesex will tighten the screw. Keep an eye too on the Rachael Heyhoe Flint Trophy, which starts today. This year, its second, consists of eight-teams (Central Sparks, South East Stars, Northern Diamonds, Western Storm, Sunrisers , Thunder, Southern Vipers and Loughborough Lightening) playing in a 50-over competition. Lastly, apologies for the slight delay to the blog - the dog rolled in something disgusting. Group One Riverside: Durham 99 all out v Essex 182 all out and 263-8 Edgbaston: Warwickshire 341 all out v Nottinghamshire 173-3 New Road: Worcestershire 421 all out v Derbyshire 91-3 Group Two Grace Road: Leicestershire 136 v Middlesex 295 and 57-1 The Oval: Surrey 473 all out v Gloucestershire 45-1 Group Three Old Trafford: Lancashire 350-6 v Yorkshire 159 all out Hove: Sussex 175 all out and 142-4 v Northants 256 all out On a traditionally overcast Roses Friday, the day meandered towards a crushing Lancashire lead. Keaton Jennings was the master builder, crafting his first red-ball century since he made 146 not out for England against Sri Lanka in November 2018. After a couple of years in the wilderness, this season he has rediscovered both touch and brio. Away he chugged, putting on 19 runs in the first 45 minutes with Luke Wells, but there were occasional boulders as well as bricks, as skimming cover drives and gleaming late cuts were plucked from the level. Yorkshire plugged away, throwing on Dom Bess, his baggy trousers and shaggy hair a sharp contrast to Jennings‚Äô ironed creases and buttoned cuffs. Yorkshire eventually got their hands on the new ball they had been after all day, and it tookonly five overs to make a breakthrough as Jennings was caught at first slip after a partnership of 175 with Wells. One became three as Wells, then Livingstone followed. But on Lancashire went. For a while it seemed they would try for maximum batting bonus points as Dane Vilas straight drove Steven Patterson for four, then dropped to one knee and pulled him behind square, and Bess was biffed for straight sixes, with Josh Bohannon reaching the scorers‚Äô box high in the media centre. But sense soon prevailed and the grind, grind, grind returned. A sixth wicket stand of 125 between Ryan ten Doeschate (55) and Adam Wheater (81) rescued Essex from an unbecoming 53 for five to finish the day with a towering lead at Chester-le-Street. Durham were earlier bowled out for 99; such was the haste of their demise that Simon Harmer didn‚Äôt even get to wrap his bowling fingers around the ball. Saif Zaib‚Äôs 64 helped Northants to a handy first-innings lead at Hove. After a post-tea wobble, Tom Haines and Ben Brown inched Sussex ahead. Lewis Hill and Callum Parkinson were the only players to make their mark on Leicestershire‚Äôs first innings of 136. Martin Andersson was too much for their middle order, picking up four for 27, his best figures for Middlesex. Hashim Amla continued to scatter his munificence at The Oval, finishing with 173, and Surrey 473, thanks to a bit of hurry-up from Rikki Clarke and Sean Abbott. Gloucestershire must now bat out two days on a turning pitch, with Amar Virdi already in the wickets shortly before rain stopped play. A last wicket can-can of 52 for Warwickshire between Liam Norwell and Oliver Hannon-Dalby proved a morning irritation to Nottinghamshire on a day interrupted by showers. Norwell, who had frying-panned three sixes, then nipped in to remove England-bound Haseeb Hameed for 39, Ben Duckett and, later, Ben Slater for 77. Ed Barnard coaxed the tail into a morning wag with another handy innings, this time of 90, as Worcestershire reached 421. On a rain-interrupted afternoon, Derbyshire lost three wickets.","charCount":"14224","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/tanyaaldred\">Tanya Aldred</a> at Old Trafford"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/live/2021/may/29/brentford-v-swansea-city-championship-play-off-final-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-29T15:17:40Z","webTitle":"Brentford v Swansea City: Championship play-off final ‚Äì live!","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2021/may/29/brentford-v-swansea-city-championship-play-off-final-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2021/may/29/brentford-v-swansea-city-championship-play-off-final-live","fields":{"headline":"Brentford v Swansea City: Championship play-off final ‚Äì live!","standfirst":"<ul><li>Premier League place up for grabs in 3pm BST Wembley game</li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/may/29/lincoln-michael-appleton-league-one-play-off-final-blackpool\">Ben Fisher catches up with Lincoln City‚Äôs Michael Appleton</a></li><li>And you can drop an <a href=\"mailto:barry.glendenning@theguardian.com\">email to Barry</a> or tweet <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bglendenning\">@bglendenning</a><br></li></ul>","trailText":"<strong>Minute-by-minute report: </strong>Will Brentford or Swansea reach the Premier League?

Hourihane‚Äôs delivery is over-hit and bounces wide of the far post. 53 min: Emiliano goes down after contesting a high ball with Conor Hourihane, who stands over the stricken Brentford goalscorer shouting angrily in his face. Replays confirm Emiliano shipped a blow to the back of the head and he‚Äôs fit to carry on after receiving medical treatment. 51 min: Some first half admin: EMiliano Marcondes was booked for something or other in the 22nd minute but I missed it a time of great goalscoring excitement. I mention it now because I won‚Äôt be hugely surprised if he gets a second yellow. In fact I will be astonished if both teams finish this game with 11 men on the pitch. 50 min: Jamal Lowe cuts inside from the wing, beats two defenders and sends his shot high and wide. Much better from Swansea but they‚Äôre still lacking composure. 48 min: That was a wonderful cross from Roberts, who was given the freedom of the right wing by Sergi Canos, who made no effort whatsoever to close him down. In the penalty arera, Pontus Jansson was stauesque as Andre Ayew beat him to the ball. Awful, awful defending from Brentford. 46 min: So close! Andre Ayew gets between defenders to head wide of the upright after connecting with a Connor Roberts cross from the right touchline. He should have scored!!! 46 min: Brentford kick off, with Swansea City hoping to become the only team to come from two down at half-time to win a Championship play-off final since Bolton Wanderers in 1995. No changes on either side yet. Some half-time reading ... Michael Appleton masterminded Lincoln City‚Äôs win over Sunderland in the League One play-off semi-final and should be barracked in the street for that act of heinousness. However, he is a very scary looking man, so do so at your peril. You can find out more about the Imps boss by reading this interview he did with Ben Fisher ahead of tomorrow‚Äôs final against his former side Blackpool. Peep! Brentford are on top after the opening 45 minutes, having opened their account with an Ivan Toney penalty, before making Swansea‚Äôs job a lot harder with an Emiliano Marcondaes strike to finish a blistering counter-attack. Swansea City are down but far from out ‚Äì they‚Äôve played reasonably well since going two behind. 45 min: Sergi Canos concedes a very cheap free-kick wide on the right not too far from the corner flag. Hourihane‚Äôs ball towards the far post bounces of the back of the leaping Andre Ayew, loops up in the air and bounces out of play off the cross-bar. Brentford keeper David Raya was very indecisive there. 44 min: Swansea press forward with Hourihane on the ball but he can find no way through the massed ranks of Brentford‚Äôs defence and ends up passing the ball backwards. 42 min: With so much at stake, this is a surprisingly open play-off final. The second half should be fantastic. 41 min: A kamikaze headed back-pass towards Woodman by Marc Guehi almost puts Mbeuma through on goal. Swansea recover and scramble the ball clear, but only just. 39 min: Oof! An attempted Mbeumo cross from the byline takes a deflection and loops up in the air, looks perilously like it might spin beneath the cross-bar and into the goal but goes out for a corner instead. Nothing comes of it. 38 min: Jay Fulton receives a pass in space outside the Brentford penalty area and tries his luck. His shot is blocked by Ethan Pinnock. 35 min: Following a period of frenetic first-half activity, there‚Äôs something of a lull. Swansea City have had more possession since conceding the second goal but have yet to give Brentford‚Äôs defence much to think about. 34 min: Another corner for Swansea, of course. Apologies! 33 min: Another corner for Brentford. Raya gathers this one at the far post. 32 min: Connor Roberts takes a long throw-in towards the Brentford penalty area, having been admonished by the refereee for trying to steal a few yards. Ethan Pinnock half-clears the ball but Swansea win a corner. Raya punches the inswinger clear. 30 min: Swansea City win a free-kick about 35 yards from the Brentford goal. Connor Roberts pings the ball into the penalty area, where Toney heads clear again. There‚Äôs a touch of the N‚ÄôGolo Kantes about the Brentford striker - there appears to be two or three of him on the pitch. 28 min: Free-kick for Brentford, wide on the left. Mbeumo sends the ball towards the far post but a Pinnock foul on Ayew allows Swansea to clear their lines. 26 min: Swansea City desperately need to get a foothold in this game or they could be embarrassed. Steve Cooper has just changed his team formation to the 4-3-3 most expected them to line up in from the get-go. They had, until now, been mirroring Brentford‚Äôs 3-5-2. 23 min: Let‚Äôs go back to Brentford‚Äôs second goal. They broke up field at the speed of light after defending a Swans free-kick with Bryan Mbeumo on the ball. He played the pass to Mads Roerslev in the penalty area and the Dane picked out Emiliano up in support at the back post. Using a combination of precision and power, he fired inside the upright, giving Woodman little or no chance. 21 min: Swansea are in all sorts of bother. They almost concede a third as Ivan Toney catches the bouncing ball and hits a wonderful side-footed effort from just outside the penalty area off the bar. The ball bounces down on to the line and away from goal. That is a serious let-off for Swansea City. Brentford double their lead! Emiliano smashes home to finish a sensational counter-attack. 19 min: Swansea City free-kick, wide on the right. Connor Roberts swings the ball into the Brentford penalty area, where Ivan Toney heads it clear. 17 min: Advantage Brentford in these early stages, their players seeming to have settled better of the two teams due in no small part to that early goal. Swansea look rattled and have yet to offer anything in the way of a goal threat. 14 min: Swansea City right midfielder Jay Fulton goes in hard on Vitaly Janelt down by the touchline with his studs up, but escapes a booking from referee Chris Kavanagh. 13 min: Brentford free-kick, wide on the left. Pontus Jannsson curls the ball across the face of goal but nobody can get on the end of it. 11 min: Ivan Toney scores his 33rd goal of the season to put the Bees on top. Swansea‚Äôs defenders were caught ball-watching as Mbeumo nipped between them to dart on to a perferctly weighted through ball from Canos. Woodman dived at the striker‚Äôs feet but didn‚Äôt get near the ball and brought him down instead. Toney‚Äôs penalty was excellent, beating Woodman despite the goalkeeper guessing the right way and diving at full stretch. IVAN TONEY SCORES! He strokes the ball into the bottom left-hand corner to give Brentford the lead. Freddie Woodman brings down Bryan Mbeumo as the Brentford striker got between defenders to run on to a through ball. 7 min: Now Grimes needlessly pings the ball wide from deep, perhaps pondering his good luck in not getting sent off or his bad luck in being on a card already while playing in central midfield. He‚Äôll have to watch his step. 6 min: Swansea City captain Matt Grimes gets booked for a nasty, reckless challenge on Sergi Canos. I think he‚Äôs very lucky not to get sent off for what looked a really wild lunge. 5 min: David Raya hacks the ball out for a Swansea City throw-in under pressure from their high press. 4 min: More Brentford pressurte and Kyle Naughton heads clear a cross from the right intended for Ivan Toney. 2 min: Mads Roerslav tries to steal in behind the Swansea defence and collect a throw-in at the byline. The ball sails out of play for a goal-kick. Now Swansea keeper Freddie Woodman gets his first touch . 2 min: Brentford goalkeeper David Raya gets an early touch, receiving the ball from a throw-in taken by Sergi Canos. 1 min: The ball is rolling in this play-off final with Swansea City doing the honours and despite having no dog in the fight I am a bag of nerves on behalf of all involved. Here‚Äôs hoping it‚Äôs a good one ... Not long now: The lucky 10,000 fans present erupt as the teams march out on to the Wembley sward led by their managers Steve Cooper and Thomas Frank. There are pensive faces everywhere to be seen on this grand occasion, with kick-off just a few minutes away. First, though ... the national anthems of the UK and Wales. Some pre-match punditry: ‚ÄúI never saw the Brentford I recognised in last year‚Äôs final,‚Äù says Sky Sports pundit Don Goodman, of the Bees‚Äô defeat at the hands of Fulham last season. ‚ÄúThat can‚Äôt happen again.‚Äù Twelve of today‚Äôs Brentford squad were involved in that final and it remains to be seen whether or not the experience will stand to them. Those teams: Thomas Frank names the same team that started the semi-final second leg against Barnsley, leaving Marcus Forss, who scored the late winner, on the bench. There had been talk he might come in for Bryan Mbeumo. Steve Cooper, makes one enforced change, with Connor Roberts replacing Wayne Routledge, who did his knee a serious mischief in their win over Barnsley. Good luck to him in his recovery. Brentford: Raya, Dalsgaard, Jansson, Pinnock, Roerslev, Jensen, Janelt, Canos, Marcondes, Toney, Mbeumo Subs: Daniels, Goode, Norgaard, Forss, Ghoddos, Reid, Fosu, Stevens, Bidstrup Swansea City: Woodman, Naughton, Cabango, Guehi, Bidwell, Fulton, Grimes, Hourihane, Ayew, Roberts, Lowe Subs: Hamer, Bennett, Latibeaudiere, Freeman, Manning, Smith, Dhanda, Whittaker, Cullen Today‚Äôs match officials Referee: Chris Kavanagh Assistant Referees: Daniel Cook and Sian Massey-Ellis Fourth Official: David Coote A reminder: there is no VAR in the play-off finals.

Friday, according to the Suddeutsche Zeitung newspaper, while farther north in <strong>Luebeck</strong>, prosecutors have opened a fraud probe, the WirtschaftsWoche weekly said. </p> <p>In <strong>Cologne</strong>, authorities carried out a surprise control of a testing centre, and the city of <strong>Munster</strong> has revoked the license of a company that operates around 50 testing centres. </p> <p>In an effort to boost Covid-19 testing, the German government made testing free several weeks ago, reimbursing companies up to ‚Ç¨18 ($22) for each test conducted.</p> <p>But according to a joint investigation by several media companies, the testing centres do not have to furnish any documents to prove how many people they‚Äôve tested when filing for government compensation and several have been inflating the figures. </p> <p>‚ÄúThey just have to send the number of tests [carried out], without any proof, and they are wired the money soon after,‚Äù according to a joint investigation by NDR and WDR public television and Suddeutsche Zeitung. </p> <p>As part of the effort, journalists counted the number of people who had come into the testing centres and then compared these numbers to what the establishments submitted to the government to get reimbursed. </p> <p>According to the investigation, one centre declared 422 tests, when only around 100 people had come in. Another filed for reimbursement of 1,743 tests done in a single day, when only 550 people had come in. </p> <p>The number of places offering free Covid-19 tests have mushroomed since the government introduced the free scheme - in the <strong>North Rhine-Westphalia</strong> region there are currently nearly 8,000 and the capital <strong>Berlin</strong> has at least 1,200. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-05-29T14:44:15.248Z\">at 3.44pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-60b24aac8f086d71cc15e759\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-05-29T14:09:42.105Z\">3.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Spain</strong> will allow cruise ships to dock in its ports from 7 June, the transport ministry said on Saturday, hoping to salvage the country‚Äôs battered tourism sector in time for the summer season. <br></p> <p>Reuters reports:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Spain‚Äôs maritime authorities approved the reopening because of falling Covid-19 incidence rates and an increase in vaccinations, according to an order in Spain‚Äôs state gazette published on Saturday. <br></p> <p>Spain banned cruise ships from docking in its ports in June 2020 as the pandemic ripped through Europe.

30s in <strong>England</strong> have received a coronavirus vaccine dose in a period of little over two weeks, new figures reveal. <br></p> <p>NHS England said that, since it began opening up the vaccine rollout to this age group on 13 May, about 53% of those aged 30 to 39 have been given at least one dose. <br></p> <p>Overall, more than 32 million people have been vaccinated with a first dose in England, almost three-quarters of the total adult population, while more than 20 million people have had both doses.</p> <p>People aged 30 to 31 were from Wednesday invited to get their jab, with more than 5m appointments made through the national booking service within 72 hours. <br></p> <p>The data comes as the NHS is asking people aged 50 and over, as well as those who are clinically vulnerable, to bring forward their second Covid-19 vaccination to help combat the spread of the B1.617.2 variant first identified in India. <br></p> <p>It follows the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) recommending earlier this month that the second dose interval be shortened from 12 weeks to eight for people in priority cohorts. <br></p> <p>NHS England said so far 600,000 people have been invited to rearrange their second jab through the national booking service, with around a quarter moving their appointment earlier. <br></p> <p>NHS England chief executive, <strong>Sir Simon Stevens,</strong> said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is remarkable that, in little over two weeks since people in their 30s began getting their invites, more than half have now had their first dose. <br></p> <p>This success is no happy accident but the result of months of careful planning and the sheer hard work and dedication of NHS staff. <br></p> <p>The Covid-19 vaccine is our most effective weapon against coronavirus and the best way of protecting yourself and loved ones, so, if you do one thing this bank holiday weekend, book your lifesaving jab and, crucially, if you‚Äôre contacted by the NHS to do so, bring forward your second dose of vital protection.</p> </blockquote> <p> Health secretary, <strong>Matt Hancock,</strong> said he was ‚Äúabsolutely thrilled‚Äù at the progress in the 30s age group and thanked those coming forward ‚Äúto do their bit to defeat the virus‚Äù. <br></p> <p>He said: <br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As we enjoy the reopening of pubs and restaurants again, vaccines will play a crucial role in protecting us and those around us. <br></p> <p>Vaccines are the best way out of this pandemic and I urge everybody to take up the offer when eligible. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-05-29T12:51:42.032Z\">at 1.51pm BST</time></p>  </div>

The WHO has not yet responded to the finding. India has recorded the lowest number of new daily infections in 45 days, the Times of India reports, although a further 173,790 fresh cases were logged in the country on Saturday. Malaysia reported 9,020 new coronavirus cases on Saturday, the highest daily rise since the start of the pandemic. More than half of people in their 30s in England have received a coronavirus vaccine dose in a period of little over two weeks. Infections in Germany continue to fall, with the country‚Äôs seven-day incidence now at 37.5 nationwide, down from 39.8 on Friday and 66.8 in the previous week. Victoria state in Australia has recorded five new locally acquired cases of coronavirus, with four linked to a food distribution delivery driver, as the state enters its second day of its fourth lockdown. The southern Chinese city of Guangzhou shut down a neighborhood and ordered its residents to stay home on Saturday for door-to-door coronavirus testing following an upsurge in infections. Launching a Covid immunisation programme for children should be considered only in special circumstances, leading health experts have warned. A coronavirus surge sweeping through Thailand‚Äôs prisons has thrown the spotlight on the kingdom‚Äôs overcrowded penal system, where some inmates have less space to sleep than the inside of a coffin. Scotland‚Äôs health secretary Humza Yousaf said there was ‚Äúsignificant community transmission‚Äù of coronavirus in hotspots in the city of Glasgow. Lebanon‚Äôs health authorities have launched a Covid-19 vaccination ‚Äúmarathon‚Äù to speed up inoculations around the country, including areas where turnout has so far been low. Spain will allow cruise ships to dock in its ports from 7 June, the transport ministry said on Saturday. That‚Äôs it from me, my colleague Nadeem Badshah will be taking over shortly. Prosecutors in several German regions have launched investigations of companies offering free Covid-19 tests after news reports said that some were padding their numbers to claim more money from the government. Prosecutors raided a company in the northwestern city of Bochum on Friday, according to the Suddeutsche Zeitung newspaper, while farther north in Luebeck, prosecutors have opened a fraud probe, the WirtschaftsWoche weekly said. In Cologne, authorities carried out a surprise control of a testing centre, and the city of Munster has revoked the license of a company that operates around 50 testing centres. In an effort to boost Covid-19 testing, the German government made testing free several weeks ago, reimbursing companies up to ‚Ç¨18 ($22) for each test conducted. But according to a joint investigation by several media companies, the testing centres do not have to furnish any documents to prove how many people they‚Äôve tested when filing for government compensation and several have been inflating the figures. ‚ÄúThey just have to send the number of tests [carried out], without any proof, and they are wired the money soon after,‚Äù according to a joint investigation by NDR and WDR public television and Suddeutsche Zeitung. As part of the effort, journalists counted the number of people who had come into the testing centres and then compared these numbers to what the establishments submitted to the government to get reimbursed. According to the investigation, one centre declared 422 tests, when only around 100 people had come in. Another filed for reimbursement of 1,743 tests done in a single day, when only 550 people had come in. The number of places offering free Covid-19 tests have mushroomed since the government introduced the free scheme - in the North Rhine-Westphalia region there are currently nearly 8,000 and the capital Berlin has at least 1,200. Spain will allow cruise ships to dock in its ports from 7 June, the transport ministry said on Saturday, hoping to salvage the country‚Äôs battered tourism sector in time for the summer season. Reuters reports: Spain‚Äôs maritime authorities approved the reopening because of falling Covid-19 incidence rates and an increase in vaccinations, according to an order in Spain‚Äôs state gazette published on Saturday. Spain banned cruise ships from docking in its ports in June 2020 as the pandemic ripped through Europe. A number of high-profile spreader events were linked to cruise liners around the world. ‚ÄúShipping companies will have to comply with measures established by the health ministry [...] to guarantee total security, both for cruise passengers and for the cities where they land,‚Äù the transport ministry tweeted on Saturday. It added that before the pandemic, Spain was the second most popular destination for international cruises in Europe. Spain, which was also the second most visited country in the world before the health crisis, was one of Europe‚Äôs worst-hit nations, recording over 79,000 coronavirus deaths and 3.7 million cases. Foreign tourism plunged 80% last year as a raft of restrictions brought the industry to a standstill. But with infection rates falling, vaccinations progressing, and most regions able to scrap curfews, Spain is looking towards reopening its vital tourism industry this summer. Last week Prime Minister Pedro S√°nchez announced Spain would allow people from anywhere in the world to enter the country from 7 Jun, provided they were vaccinated. Tens of thousands of protesters have begun marching through central London in opposition to vaccine passports and coronavirus lockdowns. The anti-lockdown march, the latest in a series of large protests against the government‚Äôs coronavirus measures, began at 1pm in Parliament Square and made its way north to Oxford Street. Protesters chanted ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù and sang along to Bob Marley‚Äôs Three Little Birds as the they waved placards proclaiming slogans such as ‚Äúwe know where the rabbit hole ends‚Äù. The route of the march was not disclosed before it began. Activists at the front were directing the crowd via a series of coloured smoke signals. Louise Creffield, the founder of Save Our Rights UK, one of the groups behind the protest, told the Guardian the focus was on medical freedom. She said: We‚Äôre very concerned about the track and trace being turned into vaccine passports and the increase in mandated testing. We‚Äôre campaigning for a medical freedom bill which would prevent any coercion and any discrimination for not partaking in a medical procedure, because where there‚Äôs that there can‚Äôt be fair and informed consent. Once we lose our medical freedom there is no saying if and when we will get it back and where this slippery slope could take us. We‚Äôve seen a huge amount of mission creep this year, so there‚Äôs no telling where it could go. In a Telegram post published the day before the protest, Save Our Rights UK said they planned to take the march on a different route to those in previous weeks. The post said: ‚ÄúThis won‚Äôt be a scenic walk, we will be taking our message to community areas that we haven‚Äôt hit before and WE WILL BE STAYING AT THE END LOCATION AS LONG AS POSSIBLE.‚Äù Lebanon‚Äôs health authorities have launched a Covid-19 vaccination ‚Äúmarathon‚Äù to speed up inoculations around the country, including areas where turnout has so far been low. The Associated Press reports: The daylong campaign offered AstraZeneca vaccines at 30 different centers around the country without prior appointment to encourage people over age 30 to show up. The capital Beirut was not included in the campaign. A vaccination program that started in February targeted older age groups, primarily through registration on a government-operated platform and appointments. As of Saturday afternoon, 7,700 people had been vaccinated in the push. Pictures of lines outside centers north of Beirut showed turnout was high, particularly among foreign workers, many of whom had been reluctant or unable to register on the government-operated digital platform. There were also lines in towns and villages in the east and mountains, where turnout has so far been fickle. Lebanon has managed to curb the number of new virus cases since the start of the year. The small country, reeling from a crippling economic crisis that predated the pandemic, is eager to restore economic activities. Officials want to open up businesses and tourist attractions ahead of the summer season to draw in much needed foreign currency. So far, over 700,000 people have been vaccinated in the country of 6 million. More than 530,000 have been infected with over 7,700 deaths since February 2020. Restrictions in place since the start of 2021 have eased over the last few weeks, allowing restaurants, bars and malls to reopen and receive customers until late. ‚ÄúWe are living many crises and our way to revive our economic life and restore some Lebanese social and culture norms forces us to think of greater ways for immunization in shorter periods,‚Äù Lebanon‚Äôs health minister Hamad Hassan told a local TV station. Launching a Covid immunisation programme for children should be considered only in special circumstances, leading health experts have warned. They say UK medical authorities, who are currently studying how vaccines for adolescents might be administered, should move with great care over the implementation of such a programme. They acknowledge it could help reduce outbreaks and the spread of Covid but also warn it could also raise important practical and ethical problems. Doctors would be giving vaccines for which there was limited information about possible side-effects to children who have nothing to gain from such a move, said Prof Adam Finn of Bristol University. ‚ÄúChildren transmit Covid to some extent, although they rarely suffer badly from the disease themselves. If you offer them vaccines, then you put them at risk of possible side-effects ‚Äì so there really needs to be some significant, tangible benefit to them, not just the indirect protection of adults from Covid-19.‚Äù The preparation of plans to give Covid vaccines to UK children comes in the wake of the US decision to launch such a programme and at a time when Germany has indicated it is planning a similar move. Canada and Switzerland have also approved plans, while the European Medicines Agency (EMA) last week agreed to extend approval for the use of the Pfizer vaccine on 12- to 15-year-olds. But the move to vaccinate children has been criticised by global health leaders, including the head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who earlier this month said that although he understood why some countries wanted to vaccinate children and adolescents, he urged them to reconsider. My colleague Robin McKie reports. More than half of people in their 30s in England have received a coronavirus vaccine dose in a period of little over two weeks, new figures reveal. NHS England said that, since it began opening up the vaccine rollout to this age group on 13 May, about 53% of those aged 30 to 39 have been given at least one dose. Overall, more than 32 million people have been vaccinated with a first dose in England, almost three-quarters of the total adult population, while more than 20 million people have had both doses. People aged 30 to 31 were from Wednesday invited to get their jab, with more than 5m appointments made through the national booking service within 72 hours. The data comes as the NHS is asking people aged 50 and over, as well as those who are clinically vulnerable, to bring forward their second Covid-19 vaccination to help combat the spread of the B1.617.2 variant first identified in India. It follows the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) recommending earlier this month that the second dose interval be shortened from 12 weeks to eight for people in priority cohorts. NHS England said so far 600,000 people have been invited to rearrange their second jab through the national booking service, with around a quarter moving their appointment earlier. NHS England chief executive, Sir Simon Stevens, said: It is remarkable that, in little over two weeks since people in their 30s began getting their invites, more than half have now had their first dose. This success is no happy accident but the result of months of careful planning and the sheer hard work and dedication of NHS staff. The Covid-19 vaccine is our most effective weapon against coronavirus and the best way of protecting yourself and loved ones, so, if you do one thing this bank holiday weekend, book your lifesaving jab and, crucially, if you‚Äôre contacted by the NHS to do so, bring forward your second dose of vital protection. Health secretary, Matt Hancock, said he was ‚Äúabsolutely thrilled‚Äù at the progress in the 30s age group and thanked those coming forward ‚Äúto do their bit to defeat the virus‚Äù. He said: As we enjoy the reopening of pubs and restaurants again, vaccines will play a crucial role in protecting us and those around us. Vaccines are the best way out of this pandemic and I urge everybody to take up the offer when eligible. The Duchess of Cambridge has been given her first dose of a coronavirus vaccine. A message from the 39-year-old on the Kensington Palace Twitter account said: ‚ÄúYesterday I received my first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine at London‚Äôs Science Museum. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hugely grateful to everyone who is playing a part in the rollout ‚Äì thank you for everything you are doing.‚Äù I‚Äôm Jedidajah Otte and will be taking back over now for the next few hours. If you have anything you‚Äôd like to flag you can reach me on Twitter @JedySays. Launching a programme of Covid-19 immunisations for children should be considered only in special circumstances, leading health experts have warned. Offering vaccines to children ‚Äì who ‚Äúrarely suffer badly from the disease themselves‚Äù ‚Äì could raise important practical and ethical problems, they said. Meanwhile, the head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also urged countries to reconsider vaccinating children when lower-income countries do not have enough doses to immunise vulnerable populations. In contrast, Klaus Okkenhaug, professor of immunology in the department of pathology at the University of Cambridge, said this morning that ‚Äúit would of course help for children to be vaccinated because it also reduces their opportunities to transmit this virus to their teachers‚Äù. He added that although it was ‚Äúa little bit of a fine balance because they are so unlikely to be affected by the virus‚Äù, he believes there‚Äôs ‚Äúa good argument‚Äù for vaccinating over-12s, given the ‚Äúphenomenal safety records‚Äù of some available vaccines. The organiser of the Edinburgh Fringe has said the world‚Äôs largest arts festival is ‚Äúin danger‚Äù if the Scottish government does not ease social distancing rules for venues within a fortnight. Shona McCarthy, chief executive of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe Society, called on ministers to replace the current two-metre rule with the one-metre rule used in hospitality in order to help secure the future of the 75-year-old festival. McCarthy told the Times Scotland: ‚ÄúWithin another two weeks, it‚Äôs going to be impossible for any [Edinburgh promoter] to put on anything. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a real danger for the future of the Fringe. One year of no festival was manageable, and we were able to keep it in hearts and minds and everybody still held that space in their calendar, as that annual moment for reconnection and getting together. At two years, you jeopardise the solid space the Fringe has held for 75 years.‚Äù She urged the government to ‚Äúhave that leap of faith‚Äù and trust venues to deliver services safely in the same way as the hospitality sector. The UK government appears to have abandoned its ‚Äúdata not dates‚Äù principle, an expert advising its coronavirus response has warned, adding that its reluctance to delay unlocking was leading to ‚Äúcontradictory‚Äù messaging. Prof Stephen Reicher, a psychologist on the Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours (Spi-B), joined scientists warning against the final lifting of restrictions on 21 June as cases passed 4,000 for the first time since late March on Friday. Reicher said the government had invested ‚Äúso much political capital‚Äù in particular dates that it has become difficult to diverge from them if the data suggests it is necessary. He told BBC Radio 4‚Äôs Today programme: ‚ÄúI think we are in a pickle of the government‚Äôs own making at the moment. I think the reason for that is it has departed from its own mantra of ‚Äòdata not dates‚Äô. Very quickly ‚Äòdata not dates‚Äô became ‚Äòdates not data‚Äô.‚Äù Hello, this is Clea Skopeliti taking over the blog for the next hour while Jedidajah has a break. You can message me on Twitter if you‚Äôd like to draw my attention to a story. Thanks! Indonesia will introduce a ‚ÄúWork From Bali‚Äù programme for civil servants aimed at helping to revive the island‚Äôs battered economy. Bloomberg reports: The coordinating ministry for maritime and investment affairs will start with a pilot project in Nusa Dua, once a prime location for major conferences including the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in 2013, to encourage more meetings and outbound activities on the island. ‚ÄúWe hope that with the arrival of government and state-owned company employees, the gears of Bali‚Äôs economy will start moving,‚Äù Hermin Esti Setyowati, an assistant deputy at the ministry, said in a statement on Saturday. Tourism-reliant Bali has been among the country‚Äôs hardest-hit provinces as borders remain shut, leaving its hotels and beaches empty. Its GDP shrank 9.9% in the first quarter from a year ago, following a 9.3% contraction for all of 2020. The island welcomed just 25 foreigners from January to March, compared with 1.1 million in the same period last year. The local government plans to accelerate its vaccination program with a goal of reaching herd immunity against Covid-19 by July, which could allow the island to reopen to international tourists. There is a ‚Äúgood argument‚Äù for vaccinating older children against Covid-19 given the safety records of some Covid vaccines, an expert has said. Klaus Okkenhaug, professor of immunology in the department of pathology at the University of Cambridge, told Times Radio that the decision on whether to give children coronavirus jabs was a ‚Äúdifficult question‚Äù that requires balancing wider benefits against the direct ones for children. He said: I think for a whole population it would of course help for children to be vaccinated because it also reduces their opportunities to transmit this virus to their teachers. Prof Okkenhaug said that when considering the ‚Äúdirect benefits to the children‚Äù it was ‚Äúa little bit of a fine balance because they are so unlikely to be affected by the virus‚Äù. He added: But I think given the phenomenal safety records of some of the vaccines out there, there‚Äôs a good argument for going ahead at least with older children, say 12 and above. A coronavirus surge sweeping through Thailand‚Äôs prisons has thrown the spotlight on the kingdom‚Äôs overcrowded penal system, where some inmates have less space to sleep than the inside of a coffin. AFP reports: More than 22,000 people have tested positive inside jails, where inmates living cheek by jowl have been encouraged to keep wearing their masks even while they sleep. Authorities have floated plans to give early releases to prisoners with underlying medical conditions and have announced funding for more testing and medical care in recent days. But those behind bars say they have been kept in the dark about the seriousness of the outbreak. ‚ÄúPrisoners don‚Äôt have the knowledge to protect themselves,‚Äù said Somyot Prueksakasemsuk, a high-profile activist facing charges under Thailand‚Äôs harsh royal defamation law. Somyot was bailed last month and told AFP that he had not been tested for Covid-19 once during his 10-week stint in custody. He was not worried about contracting the disease while in jail because he had no idea about the level of risk. ‚ÄúBut after this I‚Äôm so scared [for everyone still inside] ... if you are inside the prison you are at risk, it‚Äôs unavoidable,‚Äù he said. Thailand‚Äôs prison outbreak has skyrocketed from just 10 publicly announced cases a month ago and sparked growing public concern after a handful of prominent activists contracted the illness. Among them was student leader Panusaya ‚ÄúRung‚Äù Sithijirawattanakul, who helped lead a series of rallies last year demanding political reforms in the kingdom, and who tested positive after she was released on bail. The Thai prison population stood at around 311,000 earlier this year, the International Federation for Human Rights said ‚Äì more than two and a half times the system‚Äôs official capacity. Four inmates in every five are serving time for drug charges because of harsh anti-narcotics laws that can see offenders jailed for a decade for possessing just a few methamphetamine pills. Many cells are so packed with bodies that some inmates only have half a metre (less than 2ft) of space. ‚ÄúThat is less room for a body than the inside of a coffin,‚Äù justice minister Somsak Thepsutin told local media in February. Officials have tested more than 36,000 inmates in recent weeks and begun delivering Covid vaccines to inmates and prison staff. Somsak said he was examining ways to give early releases to prisoners with underlying medical conditions, possibly through a royal pardon. Even if the plan goes ahead, prisoners will still have to complete a quarantine before returning home. India has recorded the lowest number of new daily infections in 45 days, the Times of India reports, although a further 173,790 fresh cases were logged in the country on Saturday. The official death toll climbed to 322,512 as a further 3,617 Covid fatalities recorded on Saturday, according to health ministry data. Daily recoveries continue to outnumber the daily new cases for the 16th consecutive day. A total of 2,080,048 samples were tested in the last 24 hours, according to the Indian Council of Medical Research. The governing civic body of Mumbai on Friday allowed walk-in vaccination for students who have been accepted for university courses abroad and require immunisation to travel. France‚Äôs budget deficit for 2021 will stand at ‚Ç¨220bn, some ‚Ç¨47bn higher than previously estimated, Olivier Dussopt, the public accounts minister, told AFP on Saturday. The increase is ‚Äúa result of supporting measures that we‚Äôre continuing to take to support the recovery‚Äù from the devastating effects that Covid-19 shutdowns wreaked on the eurozone‚Äôs second-largest economy, he said. It is not yet clear how the revised numbers will affect the budget deficit when expressed as percentage of GDP, which was previously forecast to hit 9% this year, a postwar record. Public debt was previously forecast to reach 118% of GDP. The Covid-19 pandemic is expected to cost the French state nearly half a trillion euros over three years - ‚Ç¨158bn in 2020, an expected ‚Ç¨171bn in 2021 and a forecast ‚Ç¨96bn in 2022, Dussopt said in April. France has borrowed heavily to try to keep the economy afloat through three nationwide lockdowns, including money spent on supporting salaries of people furloughed and aid for companies struggling to stay afloat during the crisis. The southern Chinese city of Guangzhou shut down a neighborhood and ordered its residents to stay home on Saturday for door-to-door coronavirus testing following an upsurge in infections. Guangzhou, a business and industrial centre of 15 million people north of Hong Hong, has reported 20 new infections over the past week. The number is small compared with India‚Äôs thousands of daily cases but has alarmed Chinese authorities who believed they had the virus under control. The spread of infections was ‚Äúfast and strong,‚Äù the Global Times newspaper cited health authorities as saying. Saturday‚Äôs order to stay home applied to residents of five streets in Liwan district in the city centre. Outdoor markets, childcare centres and entertainment venues were closed. Indoor restaurant dining was prohibited, while grade schools were told to stop in-person tuition. People in parts of four nearby districts were ordered to limit outdoor activity. The city government earlier ordered testing of hundreds of thousands of residents following the initial infections. The government said some 700,000 people had been tested by Wednesday. China reports a handful of new cases every day but says almost all are believed to be people who were infected abroad, the Associated Press reports. The mainland‚Äôs official death toll stands at 4,636 out of 91,061 confirmed cases. On Saturday, the National Health Commission reported two new locally transmitted cases in Guangzhou and 14 in other parts of the country that it said came from abroad. Most of the latest infections in Guangzhou are believed to be linked to a 75-year-old woman who was found on 21 May to have the variant first identified in India, state media say. Most of the others attended a dinner with her or live together. That infection spread to the nearby city of Nanshan, where one new confirmed case and two asymptomatic cases were reported Saturday after people from Guangzhou were tested, according to the Global Times. Infections in Germany continue on a downward trend, according to the country‚Äôs Robert Koch Institute (RKI), with health authorities having reported 5,426 new cases within one day to the institute, down from 6,419 a week earlier. The seven-day incidence on Saturday morning stood at 37.5 nationwide, down from 39.8 on Friday and 66.8 in the previous week. Public holidays have, however, resulted in fewer people seeing a doctor, which means fewer samples are taken and fewer laboratory tests. Therefore, fewer new infections are reported. According to the RKI, 163 new deaths were recorded across Germany within 24 hours. A week ago 170 deaths from the virus were logged. The RKI has counted 3,675,296 Covid-19 infections since the beginning of the pandemic, but the actual total number is likely significantly higher, since many infections are not detected. The Philippines said on Saturday people were allowed to again go to work in Saudi Arabia, reversing a brief deployment ban after the kingdom said they would not be charged for Covid-19 tests and quarantine upon arrival. Reuters reports: ‚ÄúOur Saudi-bound workers will no longer be disadvantaged,‚Äù said labour secretary, Silvestre Bello. Flag carrier Philippine Airlines said it would accept Filipino workers on flights to Dammam and Riyadh, waiving rebooking fees for passengers who had been unable to board because of the deployment ban. Bello apologised for the ‚Äúinconvenience and momentary anguish‚Äù caused by his Thursday ban, saying: ‚ÄúI understand that the suspension order drew confusion and irritation among our affected departing overseas Filipino workers.‚Äù More than a million Filipinos work in Saudi Arabia, the most preferred destination of overseas Filipino workers in 2019, government data shows. Many Filipinos are hired as construction workers, domestic helpers or nurses. In 2020, Filipinos in Saudi Arabia sent home $1.8bn in remittances, a key support for the consumption-led economy. With more than 1.2 million cases and 20,722 deaths, the Philippines has the second-highest Covid-19 infections and casualties in south-east Asia, behind Indonesia. People should be ‚Äúvery concerned‚Äù about the spread of the Indian variant of coronavirus, but ‚Äúreassured‚Äù by the scale of the vaccine rollout, an expert has said. Professor Anthony Harnden, deputy chair of the UK‚Äôs Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), told BBC Breakfast that the variant was ‚Äúclearly more transmissible‚Äù. He said: We need to be reassured that we‚Äôre in a very different position now in that we‚Äôve got a highly vaccinated population and we just need to continue moving at speed. We do know that with this particular variant you do need two doses to offer complete protection, and so we‚Äôre very, very keen to make sure that all those, particularly higher risk groups, that‚Äôs the over-50s and those with underlying illness, receive their second vaccination as soon as feasible. The unlocking of society in England will be a ‚Äúgradual process‚Äù that requires a ‚Äúcautious‚Äù approach even if the government‚Äôs target date for removing all legal limits on social contact in the country on 21 June remains in place, he added, emphasising the need to ‚Äúlook very carefully‚Äù at what happens with the India variant in the next one or two weeks. He said: I think we need to look at that data very carefully before we completely un-lockdown. He suggested it was ‚Äúbetter‚Äù to be on ‚Äúthe cautious side‚Äù, adding: Even if we do un-lockdown, if you are in a vulnerable position, particularly if you‚Äôve not been vaccinated, you do need to carry on being cautious, even if the 21 June date goes ahead. So I think we‚Äôve all got used to living within boundaries at the moment and I think it‚Äôs not an all or none, I think it will be a gradual process even if the 21 June date goes ahead. Scotland‚Äôs health secretary Humza Yousaf said there was ‚Äúsignificant community transmission‚Äù of coronavirus in hotspots in the city of Glasgow. The city will remain under level 3 of Scotland‚Äôs restrictions until at least 5 June and Yousaf said urgent work was being carried out to understand the outbreak in south Glasgow and how the India variant arrived. He told BBC Radio 4‚Äôs Today: In a few concentrated hotspots ... we are seeing significant community transmission. The levels and the numbers of cases are continuing to rise. In other parts of the country ‚Äúlocal health teams tell us they are relatively contained outbreaks‚Äù linked to either schools or domestic clusters, but that was not the case in Glasgow. What we are seeing is it‚Äôs coming in in areas where there is a large, diverse community so therefore there is a probability the variant has come in from international travel. Therefore we are trying to get to the bottom of how it managed to get in. Victoria state in Australia has recorded five new locally acquired cases of coronavirus, with four linked to a food distribution delivery driver, as the state enters its second day of its fourth lockdown. The update brings the total number of cases from the latest outbreak in Melbourne to 35. A record 56,624 tests were conducted in the 24 hours to Saturday morning, surpassing the previous day‚Äôs record of 47,462 tests. On Saturday, the state‚Äôs Covid testing commander, Jeroen Weimar, said four of the new cases were linked to a person who tested positive on Friday. The Victorian health minister, Martin Foley, said the person was a food distribution delivery driver who visited ‚Äúmultiple stores and grocery sites across metropolitan Melbourne on 18 and 19 May‚Äù. There are now more than 150 exposure sites and more than 15,000 primary and secondary contacts who must self-isolate after coming into potential contact with a person with Covid-19. Foley said the individual ‚Äúworked during their infectious period‚Äù but they ‚Äúshowed no signs of Covid symptoms themselves‚Äù. He also thanked the food distribution company and customers for working with contact tracers. Weimar said four of the new cases announced on Saturday were household contacts of the delivery driver, including a student at Mount Ridley college in Craigieburn. He said these four people had only been in isolation for one day. The fifth case was separate, and was an employee of firm Stratton Finance who became infected at a display home in Mickleham. Late on Friday the Victorian health department announced new tier 1 exposure sites ‚Äì where people are most at risk of catching and spreading the virus. A full list of exposure sites can be found here. Foley announced what he called a ‚Äúhat-trick of records‚Äù, as the state administered a record number of tests and vaccinations over the past three days. Taiwan reported 486 new domestic Covid-19 cases on Saturday, including 166 cases added to the totals for recent days as it continues to readjust its infection numbers following delays in reporting positive tests. After successfully keeping coronavirus at bay, Taiwan is currently in the grip of its first serious outbreak. The island is desperately seeking vaccines to protect its people, and Taiwan‚Äôs neighbour China has offered to help, the BBC reported. Up until the mid-May, the country had logged only around 1,500 infections and 12 deaths, before cases began to rise sharply. On Tuesday, health minister Chen Shih-chung announced 2m vaccine doses would arrive in Taiwan in June, and 10m by the end of August. Russia reported 9,289 new Covid-19 cases on Saturday, including 3,241 in Moscow, taking the official national tally since the pandemic began to 5,053,748. The government coronavirus task force said 401 people had died of coronavirus-linked causes in the past 24 hours, pushing the national death toll to 120,807. The federal statistics agency has kept a separate count and has said Russia recorded around 250,000 deaths related to Covid-19 from April 2020 to March 2021. Malaysia reported 9,020 new coronavirus cases on Saturday, the highest daily toll since the start of the pandemic. This is the fifth straight day of record new infections, bringing the total number of cases in the country to 558,534. The country‚Äôs prime minister, Muhyiddin Yassin, has announced a nationwide ‚Äútotal lockdown‚Äù from 1 to 14 June that will apply to all social and economic areas, with only essential services and economic sectors listed by the national security council remaining in operation, ABC reports. ‚ÄúWith the latest rise in daily cases showing a drastically upward trend, hospital capacity across the country to treat Covid-19 patients are becoming limited,‚Äù Muhyiddin said in a statement. Prof Stephen Reicher, a psychologist on the UK‚Äôs Sage sub-committee advising the government on behavioural science, said ‚Äúconfusion‚Äù over the government‚Äôs approach was undermining efforts to control the pandemic. Ahead of the planned 21 June easing of restrictions in England, he said the government was in a ‚Äúpickle‚Äù because it appeared to have abandoned the ‚Äúdata, not dates‚Äù principle. He told BBC Radio 4‚Äôs Today: The data we are seeing at the moment suggests we have a problem. We don‚Äôt know how big the problem is - it might be bad, it might be very bad, we will learn in the next week or two. But the problem for the government is: on the one hand it can‚Äôt delay what it has been promising for so long, but on the other hand it is aware of the dangers of so doing. And so you see that in the fact that they are beginning to act in a rather contradictory way. They‚Äôre saying to us, for instance on travel: ‚Äòyou can travel internationally but please don‚Äôt‚Äô. They say of social contact ‚Äòyou can hug, but please don‚Äôt hug‚Äô. They say of restrictions, ‚Äòno restrictions but please don‚Äôt go in and out of the hotspots‚Äô. That contradiction, that sense of confusion, I think is undermining the response. Hello and welcome to our global coronavirus live blog. Vietnam health minister Nguyen Thanh Long said on Saturday the country has detected a new variant of the coronavirus, which is a mix of the India and UK Covid-19 variants and spreads quickly by air, online newspaper VnExpress reported. Vietnam‚Äôs latest coronavirus wave, which began about a month ago, has seen 3,595 local Covid-19 cases so far in 33 cities and provinces. He said the coronavirus responsible for the new wave is much more transmissible, especially in the air. Viral cultures in the laboratory revealed that the virus replicated itself very quickly, he added, explaining why there are so many new cases in different locations in a shorter time frame. So far, Vietnam has recorded the presence of seven coronavirus variants, including ones from the UK, India and South Africa.

Caution is needed in determining whether England‚Äôs coronavirus restrictions can be lifted next month or ‚Äúthings will get bad very, very quickly‚Äù, a professor whose argument against herd immunity helped trigger the first lockdown has warned. Sir Tim Gowers, a professor of mathematics at the University of Cambridge, told the Guardian the downside of being ‚Äúa bit more cautious‚Äù was a lot smaller than the downside of getting it wrong, as UK Covid cases rose by 4,184 on Friday ‚Äì the highest increase since 1 April. Asked about the next step in lockdown easing in England, due on June 21, Prof Gowers said he did not believe the plans were necessarily at risk, but urged caution. He said: Because Boris Johnson has made a big thing about all the steps being irreversible, I think he‚Äôs put himself in a position where once he takes a step, he‚Äôll be extremely reluctant to reverse because that would be a big U-turn, an embarrassing climbdown. So I think if that‚Äôs the way you‚Äôre going to play things, then you should be very, very cautious about every step you take ... And maybe everything [will] be OK, maybe the number of people who are vaccinated will be just enough ... ‚ÄòR‚Äô will broadly speaking stay below one even with Indian variants. But if it‚Äôs not OK, we know, because of mathematics, that things will get bad very, very quickly. Or at least, maybe it won‚Äôt look that quick to start with, but it‚Äôll grow exponentially. So it‚Äôll pick up speed and become a big problem. Read my colleague Ben Quinn‚Äôs full story here. Prof Christina Pagel, a member of Independent Sage from University College London, said reopening should be delayed a few more months.","charCount":"37872","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/jedidajah-otte\">Jedidajah Otte</a> (now), <a href=\"profile/clea-skopeliti\">Clea Skopeliti</a> (earlier)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2021/may/29/manhattenhenge-miserable-memorial-day-weather-mars-biannual-fiery-display","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-29T15:06:56Z","webTitle":"Manhattenhenge: miserable Memorial Day weather mars biannual fiery display","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/29/manhattenhenge-miserable-memorial-day-weather-mars-biannual-fiery-display","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2021/may/29/manhattenhenge-miserable-memorial-day-weather-mars-biannual-fiery-display","fields":{"headline":"Manhattenhenge: miserable Memorial Day weather mars biannual fiery display","standfirst":"<p>Forecasts of record cold temperatures produce clouds and rain in New York City, meaning fans of the sight will have to wait until July</p>","trailText":"Forecasts of record cold temperatures produce clouds and rain in New York City, meaning fans of the sight will have to wait until July","byline":"Oliver Milman in New York","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"963d81e6e65b94979fd31772005443ec6fb6e25f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/963d81e6e65b94979fd31772005443ec6fb6e25f/0_119_5673_3405/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manhattanhenge sunrise in New York City on 12 January.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Manhattanhenge sunrise in New York City on 12 January.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Hershorn/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/29/bad-photo-manhattanhenge-new-york\">Manhattanhenge</a>, a spectacular biannual sight in which the setting sun aligns perfectly with the street grid system on the island at the heart of New York City, was set to be obscured by damp and gloomy weather on Saturday ‚Äì one high-profile casualty of a disappointing forecast for the Memorial Day weekend, the traditional start of the American summer.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/29/bad-photo-manhattanhenge-new-york\">How to take a terrible photo of Manhattanhenge, in five easy steps</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Amid <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/29/weather/memorial-day-weekend-weather-forecast/index.html\">forecasts of record cold temperatures</a> across the north-eastern US, cloud and rain descended on New York City on Friday and showed no signs of lifting soon, a development likely to disappoint fans of the picturesque event.</p> <p>Manhattanhenge was also unable to draw large crowds last year, when the city was in the grip of strict pandemic-related shutdowns.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ed3c15e748b1c2aa847b4d11017679a6abc2f6a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed3c15e748b1c2aa847b4d11017679a6abc2f6a3/0_0_3382_5073/667.jpg\" alt=\"The setting sun aligns with New York architecture on 27 May.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The setting sun aligns with New York architecture on 27 May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>New Yorkers looked likely to have to wait a couple of months for their next opportunity to see the Manhattanhenge spectacle.

Amid forecasts of record cold temperatures across the north-eastern US, cloud and rain descended on New York City on Friday and showed no signs of lifting soon, a development likely to disappoint fans of the picturesque event. Manhattanhenge was also unable to draw large crowds last year, when the city was in the grip of strict pandemic-related shutdowns. New Yorkers looked likely to have to wait a couple of months for their next opportunity to see the Manhattanhenge spectacle. The sunlight will return to the perfect position on 12 and 13 July. As Manhattan is built with a 90-degree angle grid street system, with rivers on either side, a clear sightline of an aligned sun is available twice a year. The Manhattanhenge moniker is taken from Stonehenge, the neolithic monument in England which, it is believed, featured rituals in prehistoric times related to the sun as it lined up with its stone slabs. ‚ÄúIf you have a clear view across the grid of Manhattan at 8.13 tonight you‚Äôll see the sun perfectly framed by the buildings across our concrete jungle,‚Äù tweeted Jackie Faherty, an astrophysicist at the American Museum of Natural History, on Saturday.

To create 17,000 hours of TV would take an eternity. They couldn‚Äôt do it fast enough. They had to buy something. The question is how much Amazon can now exploit.‚Äù</p> <p>Much of the focus has been on MGM‚Äôs flagship property: James Bond. At 59 years old, the evergreen screen spy is the world‚Äôs second-longest running film franchise after Godzilla, and some analysts have estimated he could be worth half the near-$9bn price tag of the whole library.</p> <p>Bond is a treasure trove, unexploited beyond the 25 feature films focusing on its star, which Amazon would dearly love to develop into a Marvel- or <em>Star Wars</em>-like ‚Äúuniverse‚Äù. The only problem is that Bond is partly owned by Eon Productions in the UK, which is run by Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson, who exercise strict control over how the character is used ‚Äì even down to choosing the actor who plays him. Following the announcement of the deal, they reiterated that 007‚Äôs primary home would remain the big screen, saying: ‚ÄúWe are committed to continue making James Bond films for the worldwide theatrical audience.‚Äù</p> <p>Plans for one potential spin-off in 2002 ‚Äì a movie based on the character Jinx, played by Halle Berry in <em>Die Another Day</em> ‚Äì were scrapped the following year, while the highly successful Young Bond series of books for young adults has never made it beyond print.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7e861d50f650b2e4e3a04cffa72a474dfac3246b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e861d50f650b2e4e3a04cffa72a474dfac3246b/0_194_5122_3074/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael B Jordan, right, and Sylvester Stallone in Creed II.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael B Jordan, right, and Sylvester Stallone in Creed II.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Moviestore collection Ltd/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>‚ÄúI think the greatest opportunity is with the Bond franchise,‚Äù says John Mass at Content Partners, a Los Angeles-based investment firm that owns the rights to content including <em>Black Hawk Down</em>, <em>Olympus Has Fallen</em> and part of the <em>CSI</em> television franchise. ‚ÄúI think that ‚Äòuniverse‚Äô is probably an overused term, but I do think that there is a huge amount of intellectual property that has not been exploited. What Bond has demonstrated is that the asset, the brand, is resilient.‚Äù</p> <p>Still, beyond Bond, MGM ‚Äì which made $1.5bn (¬£1bn) last year, mostly from licensing its properties ‚Äì has an array of valuable assets ripe for further exploitation. <em>Rocky</em> has been given a new lease of life with the <em>Creed</em> series of films starring Michael B Jordan. A second Addams Family animated film is due for release this year, while a TV series is in the works at Netflix.

The deal to buy the 97-year-old Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which has an immense library of 4,000 film titles and 17,000 hours of TV programming, is designed to supercharge Amazon‚Äôs content pipeline, which is the lifeblood of any competitor in the global battle for streaming supremacy. As the streaming wars have intensified, new entrants ‚Äì such as Disney+, Sky, Comcast‚Äôs Peacock, and WarnerMedia‚Äôs HBO Max ‚Äì are increasingly refusing to license their own crown-jewel shows and films to rivals, in order to fuel their own streaming services. Amazon has not pursued an original-content strategy in the heavyweight way that Netflix has. Just 3% of its 41,000 hours of TV shows and films are originals or owned content, compared with a fifth of the 39,000-hour library at Netflix, according to Ampere Analysis. ‚ÄúIt is getting harder to get library content ‚Äì they‚Äôre not going to get shows like Friends now, they‚Äôre locked in elsewhere,‚Äù says Michael Pachter, a media analyst at Wedbush. ‚ÄúTo create 4,000 movies would take them 200 years. To create 17,000 hours of TV would take an eternity. They couldn‚Äôt do it fast enough. They had to buy something. The question is how much Amazon can now exploit.‚Äù Much of the focus has been on MGM‚Äôs flagship property: James Bond. At 59 years old, the evergreen screen spy is the world‚Äôs second-longest running film franchise after Godzilla, and some analysts have estimated he could be worth half the near-$9bn price tag of the whole library. Bond is a treasure trove, unexploited beyond the 25 feature films focusing on its star, which Amazon would dearly love to develop into a Marvel- or Star Wars-like ‚Äúuniverse‚Äù. The only problem is that Bond is partly owned by Eon Productions in the UK, which is run by Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson, who exercise strict control over how the character is used ‚Äì even down to choosing the actor who plays him. Following the announcement of the deal, they reiterated that 007‚Äôs primary home would remain the big screen, saying: ‚ÄúWe are committed to continue making James Bond films for the worldwide theatrical audience.‚Äù Plans for one potential spin-off in 2002 ‚Äì a movie based on the character Jinx, played by Halle Berry in Die Another Day ‚Äì were scrapped the following year, while the highly successful Young Bond series of books for young adults has never made it beyond print. ‚ÄúI think the greatest opportunity is with the Bond franchise,‚Äù says John Mass at Content Partners, a Los Angeles-based investment firm that owns the rights to content including Black Hawk Down, Olympus Has Fallen and part of the CSI television franchise. ‚ÄúI think that ‚Äòuniverse‚Äô is probably an overused term, but I do think that there is a huge amount of intellectual property that has not been exploited. What Bond has demonstrated is that the asset, the brand, is resilient.‚Äù Still, beyond Bond, MGM ‚Äì which made $1.5bn (¬£1bn) last year, mostly from licensing its properties ‚Äì has an array of valuable assets ripe for further exploitation. Rocky has been given a new lease of life with the Creed series of films starring Michael B Jordan. A second Addams Family animated film is due for release this year, while a TV series is in the works at Netflix. Disney+ has an upcoming series, Willow, based on the 1988 Ron Howard film, and a hybrid animated/live-action reboot of The Pink Panther is in the works. Meanwhile, the Russo brothers ‚Äì the directors of one of the biggest-grossing film of all time, Avengers: Endgame ‚Äì are on board to remake several films, starting with The Thomas Crown Affair; a third instalment of Legally Blonde is due next year; and CBS has psychological crime drama Clarice, a TV spin-off which has its roots in The Silence of the Lambs. But unlike MGM, which was forced into bankruptcy a decade ago and currently carries about $2bn in debt, Amazon has the financial firepower to supercharge the exploitation of this library. The company, which has $73bn in cash on hand and a market value of $1.6 trillion, spent $11bn on content last year and will lay out $15.5bn this year. It has reportedly spent $465m on its first TV series set in the world of Lord of the Rings, the rights for which were secured after Amazon‚Äôs founder, Jeff Bezos, reportedly told executives to ‚Äúfind a Game of Thrones‚Äù to take the fight to Netflix, the world‚Äôs leading streamer. Observers and analysts speculate at possibilities including a remake of Thelma and Louise, which celebrates its 30th anniversary this year, or reviving the late-80s series Thirtysomething. Franchises including Stargate and Tomb Raider appear ripe for a major new investment, while RoboCop is ready for new audiences following 2014‚Äôs disappointing remake. TV hits The Handmaid‚Äôs Tale and Fargo are currently locked in deals with Hulu and FX, but are also viewed as ripe for future exploitation. The only content off the table is some 2,000 classic films, including hits such as Gone with the Wind, The Wizard of Oz and Singin‚Äô in the Rain, which MGM sold to Warner Bros in 1986. ‚ÄúIn terms of production there is a lot of intellectual property that is under-exploited from a rights standpoint,‚Äù says Mass. ‚ÄúThere are loads of potential sequels, remakes and prequels in the MGM library. I‚Äôm sure MGM have done a good job with it, but the streaming wars are going on, and a new team of people at Amazon will uncover a lot more opportunities.‚Äù","charCount":"5660","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/marksweney\">Mark Sweney</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2021/may/29/damned-bastards-im-still-alive-gomorrah-author-hails-court-victory-over-mafia-threats","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-29T15:00:28Z","webTitle":"‚ÄòDamned bastards - I‚Äôm still alive‚Äô: Gomorrah author hails court victory over mafia threats","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/29/damned-bastards-im-still-alive-gomorrah-author-hails-court-victory-over-mafia-threats","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/may/29/damned-bastards-im-still-alive-gomorrah-author-hails-court-victory-over-mafia-threats","fields":{"headline":"‚ÄòDamned bastards - I‚Äôm still alive‚Äô: Gomorrah author hails court victory over mafia threats","standfirst":"<p>Roberto Saviano says that a court has shown that the crime clans ‚Äì whose threats forced him to live with a bodyguard ‚Äì are not invincible</p>","trailText":"Roberto Saviano says that a court has shown that the crime clans ‚Äì whose threats forced him to live with a bodyguard ‚Äì are not invincible","byline":"Ed Vulliamy","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c83fbce1b6b64e4c950a2ec1ecae2d24fec79fcc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c83fbce1b6b64e4c950a2ec1ecae2d24fec79fcc/55_141_5718_3431/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Roberto Saviano, at centre of a group of people, in 2014 at the trial of members of the Casalesi mafia clan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roberto Saviano, centre, in 2014 at the trial of members of the Casalesi mafia clan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ciro Fusco/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>The internationally renowned anti-mafia writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/14/-sp-roberto-saviano-my-life-under-armed-guard-gomorrah\">Roberto Saviano</a> has declared that ‚Äújournalism has been vindicated; words are vindicated ‚Äì and so am I‚Äù, after a landmark judgment in Rome over threats to his life.</p> <p>Judges ruled on Monday that a courtroom manoeuvre 13 years ago by a Camorra mafia boss and his lawyer constituted a threat to Saviano‚Äôs life, and that of a colleague ‚Äì Rosaria Capacchione, then of the Naples daily <em>Il Mattino</em> ‚Äì condemning the journalists to live ever since in the shadows, under bodyguard.</p> <p>‚ÄúMy life does not greatly change,‚Äù Saviano told the <em>Observer</em> after the verdict. ‚ÄúI will still need to keep my bodyguard.

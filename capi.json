A number of high-profile spreader events were linked to cruise liners around the world. <br></p> \n   <p>“Shipping companies will have to comply with measures established by the health ministry [...] to guarantee total security, both for cruise passengers and for the cities where they land,” the transport ministry tweeted on Saturday. <br></p> \n   <p>It added that before the pandemic, Spain was the second most popular destination for international cruises in Europe. <br></p> \n   <p>Spain, which was also the second most visited country in the world before the health crisis, was one of Europe’s worst-hit nations, recording over 79,000 coronavirus deaths and 3.7 million cases. Foreign tourism plunged 80% last year as a raft of restrictions brought the industry to a standstill. <br></p> \n   <p>But with infection rates falling, vaccinations progressing, and most regions able to scrap curfews, Spain is looking towards reopening its vital tourism industry this summer. <br></p> \n   <p>Last week Prime Minister <strong>Pedro Sánchez</strong> announced Spain would allow people from anywhere in the world to enter the country from 7 Jun, provided they were vaccinated.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2b98d51518b1e9fe7663f7212c9fd0bab9e1ae76\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b98d51518b1e9fe7663f7212c9fd0bab9e1ae76/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cruise ships are seen anchored at the Bay in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Canary Islands, Spain, on 28 April 2021.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cruise ships are seen anchored at the Bay in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Canary Islands, Spain, on 28 April 2021.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ramon de la Rocha/EPA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-05-29T14:17:50.996Z\">at 3.17pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-60b2423f8f088d8c3178ce20\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/damien-gayle\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-05-29T13:33:27.830Z\">2.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Tens of thousands of protesters have begun marching through central <strong>London</strong> in opposition to vaccine passports and coronavirus lockdowns. </p> \n  <p>The anti-lockdown march, the latest in a series of large protests against the government’s coronavirus measures, began at 1pm in Parliament Square and made its way north to Oxford Street.</p> \n  <p>Protesters chanted “freedom” and sang along to Bob Marley’s Three Little Birds as the they waved placards proclaiming slogans such as “we know where the rabbit hole ends”.</p> \n  <p>The route of the march was not disclosed before it began.

their 30s in <strong>England</strong> have received a coronavirus vaccine dose in a period of little over two weeks, new figures reveal. <br></p> \n  <p>NHS England said that, since it began opening up the vaccine rollout to this age group on 13 May, about 53% of those aged 30 to 39 have been given at least one dose. <br></p> \n  <p>Overall, more than 32 million people have been vaccinated with a first dose in England, almost three-quarters of the total adult population, while more than 20 million people have had both doses.</p> \n  <p>People aged 30 to 31 were from Wednesday invited to get their jab, with more than 5m appointments made through the national booking service within 72 hours. <br></p> \n  <p>The data comes as the NHS is asking people aged 50 and over, as well as those who are clinically vulnerable, to bring forward their second Covid-19 vaccination to help combat the spread of the B1.617.2 variant first identified in India. <br></p> \n  <p>It follows the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) recommending earlier this month that the second dose interval be shortened from 12 weeks to eight for people in priority cohorts. <br></p> \n  <p>NHS England said so far 600,000 people have been invited to rearrange their second jab through the national booking service, with around a quarter moving their appointment earlier. <br></p> \n  <p>NHS England chief executive, <strong>Sir Simon Stevens,</strong> said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It is remarkable that, in little over two weeks since people in their 30s began getting their invites, more than half have now had their first dose. <br></p> \n   <p>This success is no happy accident but the result of months of careful planning and the sheer hard work and dedication of NHS staff. <br></p> \n   <p>The Covid-19 vaccine is our most effective weapon against coronavirus and the best way of protecting yourself and loved ones, so, if you do one thing this bank holiday weekend, book your lifesaving jab and, crucially, if you’re contacted by the NHS to do so, bring forward your second dose of vital protection.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p> Health secretary, <strong>Matt Hancock,</strong> said he was “absolutely thrilled” at the progress in the 30s age group and thanked those coming forward “to do their bit to defeat the virus”. <br></p> \n  <p>He said: <br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>As we enjoy the reopening of pubs and restaurants again, vaccines will play a crucial role in protecting us and those around us. <br></p> \n   <p>Vaccines are the best way out of this pandemic and I urge everybody to take up the offer when eligible. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time

overcrowded penal system, where some inmates have less space to sleep than the inside of a coffin.</p> \n  <p>AFP reports:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>More than 22,000 people have tested positive inside jails, where inmates living cheek by jowl have been encouraged to keep wearing their masks even while they sleep.</p> \n   <p>Authorities have floated plans to give early releases to prisoners with underlying medical conditions and have announced funding for more testing and medical care in recent days.</p> \n   <p>But those behind bars say they have been kept in the dark about the seriousness of the outbreak.</p> \n   <p>“Prisoners don’t have the knowledge to protect themselves,” said <strong>Somyot Prueksakasemsuk</strong>, a high-profile activist facing charges under Thailand’s harsh royal defamation law.</p> \n   <p>Somyot was bailed last month and told AFP that he had not been tested for Covid-19 once during his 10-week stint in custody.</p> \n   <p>He was not worried about contracting the disease while in jail because he had no idea about the level of risk.</p> \n   <p>“But after this I’m so scared [for everyone still inside] ... if you are inside the prison you are at risk, it’s unavoidable,” he said.</p> \n   <p>Thailand’s prison outbreak has skyrocketed from just 10 publicly announced cases a month ago and sparked growing public concern after a handful of prominent activists contracted the illness.</p> \n   <p>Among them was student leader Panusaya “Rung” Sithijirawattanakul, who helped lead a series of rallies last year demanding political reforms in the kingdom, and who tested positive after she was released on bail.</p> \n   <p>The Thai prison population stood at around 311,000 earlier this year, the International Federation for Human Rights said – more than two and a half times the system’s official capacity.</p> \n   <p>Four inmates in every five are serving time for drug charges because of harsh anti-narcotics laws that can see offenders jailed for a decade for possessing just a few methamphetamine pills.</p> \n   <p>Many cells are so packed with bodies that some inmates only have half a metre (less than 2ft) of space.</p> \n   <p>“That is less room for a body than the inside of a coffin,” justice minister <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Somsak Thepsutin</strong> told local media in February.</p> \n   <p>Officials have tested more than 36,000 inmates in recent weeks and begun delivering Covid vaccines to inmates and prison staff.</p> \n   <p>Somsak said he was examining ways to give early releases to prisoners with underlying medical conditions, possibly through a royal pardon.</p> \n   <p>Even if the plan goes ahead, prisoners will still have to complete a quarantine before returning home.</p> \n  </blockquote>

There were tussles with police who tried to block access through one entrance to the shopping centre at about 6pm, before protesters quickly realised that another door just yards away was unguarded. Hundreds made it into the shopping centre where they stayed for about half an hour chanting “no more lockdowns” and “take your freedom back” before they were cleared by police with batons drawn, although without scenes of violence. In Sao Paulo, Brazil’s largest city, thousands of mask-wearing people blocked one the largest city’s avenues. One large balloon depicted President Bolsonaro as a vampire. Some protests, like the one in Rio, included images of former leftist president Luis Inacio Lula da Silva wearing the presidential sash. Authorities in Vietnam have detected a new coronavirus variant that is a combination of the Indian and UK Covid-19 variants and spreads quickly by air, Reuters reports. After successfully containing the virus for most of last year, Vietnam is grappling with a rise in infections since late April that accounts for more than half of the total 6,856 registered cases. So far, there have been 47 deaths. “At the present time, we have not yet made an assessment of the virus variant reported in Vietnam,” Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO Technical Lead for Covid-19, said. “Our country office is working with the Ministry of Health in Vietnam and we expect more information soon.” From the WHO’s current understanding, the variant detected in Vietnam was the B.1.617.2 variant, more commonly known as the Indian variant, possibly with an additional mutation, she said. “However we will provide more information as soon as we receive it,” Van Kerkhove added. Mexico reported 2,725 coronavirus cases and a further 383 deaths on Saturday, according to health ministry data. It brings the overall number of cases to 2,411,503 and the death toll to 223,455, Reuters reports. Holidaymakers affected by Covid lockdowns and state border closures might not be eligible for refunds from bookings company Airbnb, which no longer considers pandemic cancellations to be “unforeseen”. The change to Airbnb’s cancellations and refunds policy, introduced in October last year, means Covid is no longer considered an extenuating circumstance. Guests affected by pandemic-related transportation disruptions and border closures will be at the mercy of individual hosts’ cancellation policies. “After the declaration of Covid-19 as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization, the extenuating circumstances policy no longer applies because Covid-19 and its consequences are no longer unforeseen or unexpected,” Airbnb says on its website. A hat shop in Nashville, Tennessee that reportedly sold “Not Vaccinated” badges resembling the yellow Star of David which Jewish people were forced to wear by the Nazis has removed a post promoting the item, following extensive criticism online. Italy reported 83 coronavirus-related deaths on Saturday compared with 126 the day before, the health ministry said. The daily tally of new infections fell to 3,351 from 3,738, Reuters reports. France reported the number of people in intensive care units with Covid-19 fell by 76 to 3,028 on Saturday, while the overall number of people in hospital with the disease fell by 425 to 16,847. The UK government said a further seven people had died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19 as of Saturday, bringing the UK total to 127,775. The government also said that, as of 9am on Saturday, there had been a further 3,398 lab-confirmed cases in the UK. It brings the total to 4,480,945. Vietnam’s health minister Nguyen Thanh Long said on Saturday the country had detected a new variant of the coronavirus, which is a mix of the India and UK variants and spreads quickly by air, the online newspaper VnExpress reported. The World Health Organization has not yet responded to the finding. India has recorded the lowest number of new daily infections in 45 days, the Times of India reports, although a further 173,790 fresh cases were logged in the country on Saturday. Malaysia reported 9,020 new coronavirus cases on Saturday, the highest daily rise since the start of the pandemic. More than half of people in their 30s in England have received a coronavirus vaccine dose in a little over two weeks. Infections in Germany continue to fall, with the country’s seven-day incidence now at 37.5 nationwide, down from 39.8 on Friday and 66.8 in the previous week. Victoria state in Australia has recorded five new locally acquired cases of coronavirus – with four linked to a food distribution delivery driver – as the state enters its second day of its fourth lockdown. The southern Chinese city of Guangzhou shut down a neighbourhood and ordered its residents to stay at home on Saturday for door-to-door coronavirus testing following a fast rise in infections. Launching a Covid immunisation programme for children should be considered only in special circumstances, leading health experts have warned. A coronavirus surge sweeping through Thailand’s prisons has thrown the spotlight on the kingdom’s overcrowded penal system, where some inmates have less space to sleep than the inside of a coffin. Scotland’s health secretary, Humza Yousaf, said there was “significant community transmission” of coronavirus in hotspots in the city of Glasgow. Lebanon’s health authorities have launched a Covid-19 vaccination “marathon” to speed up inoculations around the country, including areas where turnout has been low. Spain will allow cruise ships to dock in its ports from 7 June, the transport ministry said on Saturday. Anti-vaccine protest in London descends into clashes between protesters and police. Boris Johnson and the UK government are too busy “covering their own backs” to properly counter the threat posed by the Indian coronavirus variant, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer claimed. Following Dominic Cummings’ explosive evidence about the prime minister’s handling of the pandemic, Sir Keir said “mistakes are being repeated” as the government considers whether to further ease restrictions. Writing in the Observer, Sir Keir said Johnson’s reluctance to impose a second lockdown in autumn last year meant “avoidable and unforgivable” deaths in the second wave of the virus. “The first wave we faced an unprecedented crisis. Decision making was undoubtedly difficult. Mistakes were inevitable. And the British public understand that. “But by the summer, we knew much more about the virus. “The prime minister was warned to prepare for a second wave. He did not do so. And over twice as many people died in the second wave than in the first.” Hundreds of anti-lockdown protesters invaded the Westfield shopping centre in West London on Saturday evening, at the end of a mass protest that drew hundreds of thousands of marchers at its height. There were tussles with police who tried to block access through one entrance to the shopping centre at about 6pm, before protesters quickly realised that another door just yards away was unguarded. Hundreds made it into the shopping centre where they stayed for about half an hour before the were cleared by police. The Westfield invasion came after a mass march snaking about 12 miles through London, starting in Parliament Square and reaching as far west as Hammersmith. At its height there appeared to be hundreds of thousands of people taking part. One protester, who would give his name only as Paul, from Bedfordshire, said he was taking part because he was scared about where the unprecedented crackdown on civil liberties under the pretext of fighting the pandemic would lead. “I’m frightened about our liberties. Or choice about whether we want to be vaccinated or not. Lots of people legitimately don’t have any faith in it at all.” Tens of thousands of protesters have poured on to the streets of Brazil’s largest cities to demand the impeachment of President Jair Bolsonaro over his catastrophic response to a coronavirus pandemic that has claimed nearly half a million Brazilian lives. The demonstrators turned out in more than 200 cities and towns for what is the biggest anti-Bolsonaro mobilisation since Brazil’s Covid outbreak began. Osvaldo Bazani da Silva, a 48-year-old hairdresser who lost his younger brother to Covid-19, said: “We can’t lose any more Brazilian lives. We need to hit the streets every single day until this government falls.” In Rio many marchers carried homemade placards remembering loved ones they have lost to an epidemic that has killed nearly 460,000 Brazilians, the world’s second largest official death toll after the US. “I’m here in his memory,” said Luiz Dantas, 18, clutching a photograph of his grandfather, Sebastião, who died in February aged 75. Lebanon vaccinated more than 10,000 people on Saturday as part of a day-long vaccine “marathon” organised by the health ministry to ramp up inoculation rates in the crisis-hit country. The ministry said that by 6.30pm (15.30 GMT), 10,452 people over the age of 30 received jabs of the AstraZeneca vaccine at different facilities across the country. They were allowed to enter vaccination centres on a walk-in basis from early Saturday morning in what health authorities have dubbed a vaccine “marathon”. The capital Beirut and some other parts of the country were excluded from the initiative, but outgoing health minister Hamad Hassan said there were plans for a second such event that would cover more areas, AFP reports. Hundreds of maskless protesters demonstrated against coronavirus restrictions in front of EU buildings in Brussels on Saturday, with many yelling “Freedom” and claiming Covid-19 was no worse than the flu. The protest started in a major city park and marched towards a square where EU offices, including the European Commission building, are located, AFP reports. Belgian police blocked access to the square with barbed wire and a line of 40 officers in riot gear prevented demonstrators moving closer. A water cannon idled nearby, but was not used, and the protest dispersed after around four hours. A fundraiser to create a memorial in St Paul’s Cathedral for those who have died in the Covid-19 pandemic has reached its £2.3m goal in under a month. An online book of remembrance will be installed in a portico structure within the London cathedral. St Paul’s set up the Remember Me project, an online book of remembrance for Covid-19 victims, in May 2020. More than 9,400 names have been added to the book so far, along with photographs and tributes. On its fundraising page, the cathedral said that it “hopes to create a memorial that people can go through into a tranquil space, draw breath and take a moment to remember the many individuals, loved and cherished, who have died as a result of the pandemic”. France reported the number of people in intensive care units with Covid-19 fell by 76 to 3,028 on Saturday, while the overall number of people in hospital with the disease fell by 425 to 16,847. Both numbers have been on a downward trend in recent weeks. The health ministry also reported 68 new coronavirus deaths in hospitals, bringing the total to 82,946. Thousands of people, masked and tested for the coronavirus, packed inside a Paris arena for a concert Saturday as part of a public health experiment to prepare France to host large scale events. Associated Press reports: The show at AccorHotels Arena in eastern Paris features 1980s French rock band Indochine and DJ Etienne de Crecy. But the attention was mostly on the concert-goers. The Paris public hospital authority helped organize the event to determine whether it’s safe to allow 5,000 masked people to dance together in the open pit of an indoor concert arena without social distancing. The attendees are seeing the show for free but were required to take three virus tests, two before and one after the concert. To further reduce risk, organisers only allowed people 18-45 years old without underlying health conditions to participate, according to the hospital authority. France has not allowed such music concerts since early 2020. Cultural venues were shut for most of the past 14 months as authorities tried to contain persistent surges of virus infections that filled hospitals and were linked to more than 109,000 deaths. My colleague Damien Gayle is covering the protest through London in opposition to vaccine passports and coronavirus lockdowns. The anti-lockdown march is the latest in a series of large protests against the UK government’s coronavirus measures. Large crowds of football fans took over Porto’s riverside area on Saturday ahead of the Champions League final between Chelsea and Manchester City. Some 16,500 fans will be allowed into the stadium when the match kicks off at 8 p.m. but many others travelled to support their teams from the sidelines. Dozens of packed planes touched down at the city’s airport on Saturday morning. The fans from England were largely maskless and did not socially distance, to the annoyance of some locals, Reuters reports. In Portugal, masks are still mandatory outside if people cannot observe social distancing. Ines Andrade, a 19-year-old student from Porto, was visibly upset as she watched the scenes from nearby, saying it was “revolting” to see how fans were behaving, just four months after Portugal faced its toughest battle against Covid-19. “For us, Portuguese, is it very disturbing to see these people come here and ruin everything we have tried to achieve over the last months and year.” Fans had to present a negative Covid-19 test on arrival at the airport. But there has been concern in Portugal that the event could fuel a spike in cases after authorities decided to relax coronavirus rules for the match. Portugal is on the British government’s “green” list allowing tourists to visit the country without quarantining on their return. An update from the UK’s health secretary. Germany will introduce stricter controls on the administering of coronavirus tests, health minister Jens Spahn said on Saturday, after local media reports accused some centres of accounting fraud. “There will be more random checks,” Spahn said on Twitter. “Pragmatism is necessary these days. Those who exploit that must not be allowed to get away with it.” Germany offers its citizens at least one free coronavirus test per week, with several federal states providing one free test a day. The state pays €18 (£15.46) per test. Many private test centres have been set up in recent weeks, Reuters reports. Some coronavirus test centres have been charging for more tests than they have carried out, daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung and broadcaster ARD reported this week. Prosecutors in the city of Bochum opened an investigation into one centre following the reports. Carmakers in the Indian automobile hub of Chennai, in Tamil Nadu, will be allowed to keep operating, the state government said, amid protests by workers who fear catching Covid-19 in one of the country’s hardest-hit states. Tamil Nadu authorities extended a near-total lockdown on Friday as coronavirus infections and deaths rise in the southern state, where average cases run at more than 30,000 a day, official figures show, Reuters reports. But a government order issued on Saturday said so-called continuous process industries, which include auto factories, would be allowed to function in accordance with measures such as social distancing to stem the virus’s spread. It also urged vehicle manufacturers to initiate immediate action to vaccinate all their employees within a month. Italy reported 83 coronavirus-related deaths on Saturday compared with 126 the day before, the health ministry said. The daily tally of new infections fell to 3,351 from 3,738, Reuters reports. Italy has registered 126,002 deaths linked to Covid-19 since its outbreak in February last year, the second-highest toll in Europe after Britain and the seventh-highest in the world. The country has reported 4.213 million cases to date. The number of patients in hospital with Covid-19 – not including those in intensive care – stood at 6,800 on Saturday, down from 7,192 a day earlier. The UK government said a further seven people had died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19 as of Saturday, bringing the UK total to 127,775. Separate figures published by the Office for National Statistics show there have been 153,000 deaths registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate. The government also said that, as of 9am on Saturday, there had been a further 3,398 lab-confirmed cases in the UK. It brings the total to 4,480,945. Vietnam’s health minister Nguyen Thanh Long said on Saturday the country had detected a new variant of the coronavirus, which is a mix of the India and UK variants and spreads quickly by air, the online newspaper VnExpress reported.

More than half of people in their 30s in England have received a coronavirus vaccine dose in a little over two weeks. Infections in Germany continue to fall, with the country’s seven-day incidence now at 37.5 nationwide, down from 39.8 on Friday and 66.8 in the previous week. Victoria state in Australia has recorded five new locally acquired cases of coronavirus – with four linked to a food distribution delivery driver – as the state enters its second day of its fourth lockdown. The southern Chinese city of Guangzhou shut down a neighbourhood and ordered its residents to stay at home on Saturday for door-to-door coronavirus testing following a fast rise in infections. Launching a Covid immunisation programme for children should be considered only in special circumstances, leading health experts have warned. A coronavirus surge sweeping through Thailand’s prisons has thrown the spotlight on the kingdom’s overcrowded penal system, where some inmates have less space to sleep than the inside of a coffin. Scotland’s health secretary, Humza Yousaf, said there was “significant community transmission” of coronavirus in hotspots in the city of Glasgow. Lebanon’s health authorities have launched a Covid-19 vaccination “marathon” to speed up inoculations around the country, including areas where turnout has been low. Spain will allow cruise ships to dock in its ports from 7 June, the transport ministry said on Saturday. That’s it from me, my colleague Nadeem Badshah will be taking over shortly. Prosecutors in several German regions have launched investigations of companies offering free Covid-19 tests after news reports said that some were padding their numbers to claim more money from the government. Prosecutors raided a company in the northwestern city of Bochum on Friday, according to the Suddeutsche Zeitung newspaper, while farther north in Luebeck, prosecutors have opened a fraud probe, the WirtschaftsWoche weekly said. In Cologne, authorities carried out a surprise control of a testing centre, and the city of Munster has revoked the license of a company that operates around 50 testing centres. In an effort to boost Covid-19 testing, the German government made testing free several weeks ago, reimbursing companies up to €18 ($22) for each test conducted. But according to a joint investigation by several media companies, the testing centres do not have to furnish any documents to prove how many people they’ve tested when filing for government compensation and several have been inflating the figures. “They just have to send the number of tests [carried out], without any proof, and they are wired the money soon after,” according to a joint investigation by NDR and WDR public television and Suddeutsche Zeitung. As part of the effort, journalists counted the number of people who had come into the testing centres and then compared these numbers to what the establishments submitted to the government to get reimbursed. According to the investigation, one centre declared 422 tests, when only around 100 people had come in. Another filed for reimbursement of 1,743 tests done in a single day, when only 550 people had come in. The number of places offering free Covid-19 tests have mushroomed since the government introduced the free scheme - in the North Rhine-Westphalia region there are currently nearly 8,000 and the capital Berlin has at least 1,200. Spain will allow cruise ships to dock in its ports from 7 June, the transport ministry said on Saturday, hoping to salvage the country’s battered tourism sector in time for the summer season. Reuters reports: Spain’s maritime authorities approved the reopening because of falling Covid-19 incidence rates and an increase in vaccinations, according to an order in Spain’s state gazette published on Saturday. Spain banned cruise ships from docking in its ports in June 2020 as the pandemic ripped through Europe. A number of high-profile spreader events were linked to cruise liners around the world. “Shipping companies will have to comply with measures established by the health ministry [...] to guarantee total security, both for cruise passengers and for the cities where they land,” the transport ministry tweeted on Saturday. It added that before the pandemic, Spain was the second most popular destination for international cruises in Europe. Spain, which was also the second most visited country in the world before the health crisis, was one of Europe’s worst-hit nations, recording over 79,000 coronavirus deaths and 3.7 million cases. Foreign tourism plunged 80% last year as a raft of restrictions brought the industry to a standstill. But with infection rates falling, vaccinations progressing, and most regions able to scrap curfews, Spain is looking towards reopening its vital tourism industry this summer. Last week Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez announced Spain would allow people from anywhere in the world to enter the country from 7 Jun, provided they were vaccinated. Tens of thousands of protesters have begun marching through central London in opposition to vaccine passports and coronavirus lockdowns. The anti-lockdown march, the latest in a series of large protests against the government’s coronavirus measures, began at 1pm in Parliament Square and made its way north to Oxford Street. Protesters chanted “freedom” and sang along to Bob Marley’s Three Little Birds as the they waved placards proclaiming slogans such as “we know where the rabbit hole ends”. The route of the march was not disclosed before it began. Activists at the front were directing the crowd via a series of coloured smoke signals. Louise Creffield, the founder of Save Our Rights UK, one of the groups behind the protest, told the Guardian the focus was on medical freedom. She said: We’re very concerned about the track and trace being turned into vaccine passports and the increase in mandated testing. We’re campaigning for a medical freedom bill which would prevent any coercion and any discrimination for not partaking in a medical procedure, because where there’s that there can’t be fair and informed consent. Once we lose our medical freedom there is no saying if and when we will get it back and where this slippery slope could take us. We’ve seen a huge amount of mission creep this year, so there’s no telling where it could go. In a Telegram post published the day before the protest, Save Our Rights UK said they planned to take the march on a different route to those in previous weeks. The post said: “This won’t be a scenic walk, we will be taking our message to community areas that we haven’t hit before and WE WILL BE STAYING AT THE END LOCATION AS LONG AS POSSIBLE.” Lebanon’s health authorities have launched a Covid-19 vaccination “marathon” to speed up inoculations around the country, including areas where turnout has so far been low. The Associated Press reports: The daylong campaign offered AstraZeneca vaccines at 30 different centers around the country without prior appointment to encourage people over age 30 to show up. The capital Beirut was not included in the campaign. A vaccination program that started in February targeted older age groups, primarily through registration on a government-operated platform and appointments. As of Saturday afternoon, 7,700 people had been vaccinated in the push. Pictures of lines outside centers north of Beirut showed turnout was high, particularly among foreign workers, many of whom had been reluctant or unable to register on the government-operated digital platform. There were also lines in towns and villages in the east and mountains, where turnout has so far been fickle. Lebanon has managed to curb the number of new virus cases since the start of the year. The small country, reeling from a crippling economic crisis that predated the pandemic, is eager to restore economic activities. Officials want to open up businesses and tourist attractions ahead of the summer season to draw in much needed foreign currency. So far, over 700,000 people have been vaccinated in the country of 6 million. More than 530,000 have been infected with over 7,700 deaths since February 2020. Restrictions in place since the start of 2021 have eased over the last few weeks, allowing restaurants, bars and malls to reopen and receive customers until late. “We are living many crises and our way to revive our economic life and restore some Lebanese social and culture norms forces us to think of greater ways for immunization in shorter periods,” Lebanon’s health minister Hamad Hassan told a local TV station. Launching a Covid immunisation programme for children should be considered only in special circumstances, leading health experts have warned. They say UK medical authorities, who are currently studying how vaccines for adolescents might be administered, should move with great care over the implementation of such a programme. They acknowledge it could help reduce outbreaks and the spread of Covid but also warn it could also raise important practical and ethical problems. Doctors would be giving vaccines for which there was limited information about possible side-effects to children who have nothing to gain from such a move, said Prof Adam Finn of Bristol University. “Children transmit Covid to some extent, although they rarely suffer badly from the disease themselves. If you offer them vaccines, then you put them at risk of possible side-effects – so there really needs to be some significant, tangible benefit to them, not just the indirect protection of adults from Covid-19.” The preparation of plans to give Covid vaccines to UK children comes in the wake of the US decision to launch such a programme and at a time when Germany has indicated it is planning a similar move. Canada and Switzerland have also approved plans, while the European Medicines Agency (EMA) last week agreed to extend approval for the use of the Pfizer vaccine on 12- to 15-year-olds. But the move to vaccinate children has been criticised by global health leaders, including the head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who earlier this month said that although he understood why some countries wanted to vaccinate children and adolescents, he urged them to reconsider. My colleague Robin McKie reports. More than half of people in their 30s in England have received a coronavirus vaccine dose in a period of little over two weeks, new figures reveal. NHS England said that, since it began opening up the vaccine rollout to this age group on 13 May, about 53% of those aged 30 to 39 have been given at least one dose. Overall, more than 32 million people have been vaccinated with a first dose in England, almost three-quarters of the total adult population, while more than 20 million people have had both doses. People aged 30 to 31 were from Wednesday invited to get their jab, with more than 5m appointments made through the national booking service within 72 hours. The data comes as the NHS is asking people aged 50 and over, as well as those who are clinically vulnerable, to bring forward their second Covid-19 vaccination to help combat the spread of the B1.617.2 variant first identified in India. It follows the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) recommending earlier this month that the second dose interval be shortened from 12 weeks to eight for people in priority cohorts. NHS England said so far 600,000 people have been invited to rearrange their second jab through the national booking service, with around a quarter moving their appointment earlier. NHS England chief executive, Sir Simon Stevens, said: It is remarkable that, in little over two weeks since people in their 30s began getting their invites, more than half have now had their first dose. This success is no happy accident but the result of months of careful planning and the sheer hard work and dedication of NHS staff. The Covid-19 vaccine is our most effective weapon against coronavirus and the best way of protecting yourself and loved ones, so, if you do one thing this bank holiday weekend, book your lifesaving jab and, crucially, if you’re contacted by the NHS to do so, bring forward your second dose of vital protection. Health secretary, Matt Hancock, said he was “absolutely thrilled” at the progress in the 30s age group and thanked those coming forward “to do their bit to defeat the virus”. He said: As we enjoy the reopening of pubs and restaurants again, vaccines will play a crucial role in protecting us and those around us. Vaccines are the best way out of this pandemic and I urge everybody to take up the offer when eligible. The Duchess of Cambridge has been given her first dose of a coronavirus vaccine. A message from the 39-year-old on the Kensington Palace Twitter account said: “Yesterday I received my first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine at London’s Science Museum. “I’m hugely grateful to everyone who is playing a part in the rollout – thank you for everything you are doing.” I’m Jedidajah Otte and will be taking back over now for the next few hours.

Launching a programme of Covid-19 immunisations for children should be considered only in special circumstances, leading health experts have warned. Offering vaccines to children – who “rarely suffer badly from the disease themselves” – could raise important practical and ethical problems, they said. Meanwhile, the head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also urged countries to reconsider vaccinating children when lower-income countries do not have enough doses to immunise vulnerable populations. In contrast, Klaus Okkenhaug, professor of immunology in the department of pathology at the University of Cambridge, said this morning that “it would of course help for children to be vaccinated because it also reduces their opportunities to transmit this virus to their teachers”. He added that although it was “a little bit of a fine balance because they are so unlikely to be affected by the virus”, he believes there’s “a good argument” for vaccinating over-12s, given the “phenomenal safety records” of some available vaccines. The organiser of the Edinburgh Fringe has said the world’s largest arts festival is “in danger” if the Scottish government does not ease social distancing rules for venues within a fortnight. Shona McCarthy, chief executive of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe Society, called on ministers to replace the current two-metre rule with the one-metre rule used in hospitality in order to help secure the future of the 75-year-old festival. McCarthy told the Times Scotland: “Within another two weeks, it’s going to be impossible for any [Edinburgh promoter] to put on anything. “There’s a real danger for the future of the Fringe. One year of no festival was manageable, and we were able to keep it in hearts and minds and everybody still held that space in their calendar, as that annual moment for reconnection and getting together. At two years, you jeopardise the solid space the Fringe has held for 75 years.” She urged the government to “have that leap of faith” and trust venues to deliver services safely in the same way as the hospitality sector. The UK government appears to have abandoned its “data not dates” principle, an expert advising its coronavirus response has warned, adding that its reluctance to delay unlocking was leading to “contradictory” messaging. Prof Stephen Reicher, a psychologist on the Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours (Spi-B), joined scientists warning against the final lifting of restrictions on 21 June as cases passed 4,000 for the first time since late March on Friday. Reicher said the government had invested “so much political capital” in particular dates that it has become difficult to diverge from them if the data suggests it is necessary. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I think we are in a pickle of the government’s own making at the moment. I think the reason for that is it has departed from its own mantra of ‘data not dates’. Very quickly ‘data not dates’ became ‘dates not data’.” Hello, this is Clea Skopeliti taking over the blog for the next hour while Jedidajah has a break.

Indonesia will introduce a “Work From Bali” programme for civil servants aimed at helping to revive the island’s battered economy. Bloomberg reports: The coordinating ministry for maritime and investment affairs will start with a pilot project in Nusa Dua, once a prime location for major conferences including the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in 2013, to encourage more meetings and outbound activities on the island. “We hope that with the arrival of government and state-owned company employees, the gears of Bali’s economy will start moving,” Hermin Esti Setyowati, an assistant deputy at the ministry, said in a statement on Saturday. Tourism-reliant Bali has been among the country’s hardest-hit provinces as borders remain shut, leaving its hotels and beaches empty. Its GDP shrank 9.9% in the first quarter from a year ago, following a 9.3% contraction for all of 2020. The island welcomed just 25 foreigners from January to March, compared with 1.1 million in the same period last year. The local government plans to accelerate its vaccination program with a goal of reaching herd immunity against Covid-19 by July, which could allow the island to reopen to international tourists. There is a “good argument” for vaccinating older children against Covid-19 given the safety records of some Covid vaccines, an expert has said. Klaus Okkenhaug, professor of immunology in the department of pathology at the University of Cambridge, told Times Radio that the decision on whether to give children coronavirus jabs was a “difficult question” that requires balancing wider benefits against the direct ones for children. He said: I think for a whole population it would of course help for children to be vaccinated because it also reduces their opportunities to transmit this virus to their teachers. Prof Okkenhaug said that when considering the “direct benefits to the children” it was “a little bit of a fine balance because they are so unlikely to be affected by the virus”. He added: But I think given the phenomenal safety records of some of the vaccines out there, there’s a good argument for going ahead at least with older children, say 12 and above. A coronavirus surge sweeping through Thailand’s prisons has thrown the spotlight on the kingdom’s overcrowded penal system, where some inmates have less space to sleep than the inside of a coffin. AFP reports: More than 22,000 people have tested positive inside jails, where inmates living cheek by jowl have been encouraged to keep wearing their masks even while they sleep. Authorities have floated plans to give early releases to prisoners with underlying medical conditions and have announced funding for more testing and medical care in recent days. But those behind bars say they have been kept in the dark about the seriousness of the outbreak. “Prisoners don’t have the knowledge to protect themselves,” said Somyot Prueksakasemsuk, a high-profile activist facing charges under Thailand’s harsh royal defamation law. Somyot was bailed last month and told AFP that he had not been tested for Covid-19 once during his 10-week stint in custody. He was not worried about contracting the disease while in jail because he had no idea about the level of risk. “But after this I’m so scared [for everyone still inside] ... if you are inside the prison you are at risk, it’s unavoidable,” he said. Thailand’s prison outbreak has skyrocketed from just 10 publicly announced cases a month ago and sparked growing public concern after a handful of prominent activists contracted the illness. Among them was student leader Panusaya “Rung” Sithijirawattanakul, who helped lead a series of rallies last year demanding political reforms in the kingdom, and who tested positive after she was released on bail. The Thai prison population stood at around 311,000 earlier this year, the International Federation for Human Rights said – more than two and a half times the system’s official capacity. Four inmates in every five are serving time for drug charges because of harsh anti-narcotics laws that can see offenders jailed for a decade for possessing just a few methamphetamine pills. Many cells are so packed with bodies that some inmates only have half a metre (less than 2ft) of space. “That is less room for a body than the inside of a coffin,” justice minister Somsak Thepsutin told local media in February. Officials have tested more than 36,000 inmates in recent weeks and begun delivering Covid vaccines to inmates and prison staff. Somsak said he was examining ways to give early releases to prisoners with underlying medical conditions, possibly through a royal pardon. Even if the plan goes ahead, prisoners will still have to complete a quarantine before returning home. India has recorded the lowest number of new daily infections in 45 days, the Times of India reports, although a further 173,790 fresh cases were logged in the country on Saturday. The official death toll climbed to 322,512 as a further 3,617 Covid fatalities recorded on Saturday, according to health ministry data. Daily recoveries continue to outnumber the daily new cases for the 16th consecutive day. A total of 2,080,048 samples were tested in the last 24 hours, according to the Indian Council of Medical Research. The governing civic body of Mumbai on Friday allowed walk-in vaccination for students who have been accepted for university courses abroad and require immunisation to travel. France’s budget deficit for 2021 will stand at €220bn, some €47bn higher than previously estimated, Olivier Dussopt, the public accounts minister, told AFP on Saturday. The increase is “a result of supporting measures that we’re continuing to take to support the recovery” from the devastating effects that Covid-19 shutdowns wreaked on the eurozone’s second-largest economy, he said. It is not yet clear how the revised numbers will affect the budget deficit when expressed as percentage of GDP, which was previously forecast to hit 9% this year, a postwar record. Public debt was previously forecast to reach 118% of GDP. The Covid-19 pandemic is expected to cost the French state nearly half a trillion euros over three years - €158bn in 2020, an expected €171bn in 2021 and a forecast €96bn in 2022, Dussopt said in April. France has borrowed heavily to try to keep the economy afloat through three nationwide lockdowns, including money spent on supporting salaries of people furloughed and aid for companies struggling to stay afloat during the crisis. The southern Chinese city of Guangzhou shut down a neighborhood and ordered its residents to stay home on Saturday for door-to-door coronavirus testing following an upsurge in infections. Guangzhou, a business and industrial centre of 15 million people north of Hong Hong, has reported 20 new infections over the past week. The number is small compared with India’s thousands of daily cases but has alarmed Chinese authorities who believed they had the virus under control. The spread of infections was “fast and strong,” the Global Times newspaper cited health authorities as saying. Saturday’s order to stay home applied to residents of five streets in Liwan district in the city centre. Outdoor markets, childcare centres and entertainment venues were closed. Indoor restaurant dining was prohibited, while grade schools were told to stop in-person tuition. People in parts of four nearby districts were ordered to limit outdoor activity. The city government earlier ordered testing of hundreds of thousands of residents following the initial infections. The government said some 700,000 people had been tested by Wednesday. China reports a handful of new cases every day but says almost all are believed to be people who were infected abroad, the Associated Press reports. The mainland’s official death toll stands at 4,636 out of 91,061 confirmed cases. On Saturday, the National Health Commission reported two new locally transmitted cases in Guangzhou and 14 in other parts of the country that it said came from abroad. Most of the latest infections in Guangzhou are believed to be linked to a 75-year-old woman who was found on 21 May to have the variant first identified in India, state media say. Most of the others attended a dinner with her or live together. That infection spread to the nearby city of Nanshan, where one new confirmed case and two asymptomatic cases were reported Saturday after people from Guangzhou were tested, according to the Global Times. Infections in Germany continue on a downward trend, according to the country’s Robert Koch Institute (RKI), with health authorities having reported 5,426 new cases within one day to the institute, down from 6,419 a week earlier. The seven-day incidence on Saturday morning stood at 37.5 nationwide, down from 39.8 on Friday and 66.8 in the previous week. Public holidays have, however, resulted in fewer people seeing a doctor, which means fewer samples are taken and fewer laboratory tests. Therefore, fewer new infections are reported. According to the RKI, 163 new deaths were recorded across Germany within 24 hours. A week ago 170 deaths from the virus were logged. The RKI has counted 3,675,296 Covid-19 infections since the beginning of the pandemic, but the actual total number is likely significantly higher, since many infections are not detected. The Philippines said on Saturday people were allowed to again go to work in Saudi Arabia, reversing a brief deployment ban after the kingdom said they would not be charged for Covid-19 tests and quarantine upon arrival. Reuters reports: “Our Saudi-bound workers will no longer be disadvantaged,” said labour secretary, Silvestre Bello. Flag carrier Philippine Airlines said it would accept Filipino workers on flights to Dammam and Riyadh, waiving rebooking fees for passengers who had been unable to board because of the deployment ban. Bello apologised for the “inconvenience and momentary anguish” caused by his Thursday ban, saying: “I understand that the suspension order drew confusion and irritation among our affected departing overseas Filipino workers.” More than a million Filipinos work in Saudi Arabia, the most preferred destination of overseas Filipino workers in 2019, government data shows. Many Filipinos are hired as construction workers, domestic helpers or nurses. In 2020, Filipinos in Saudi Arabia sent home $1.8bn in remittances, a key support for the consumption-led economy. With more than 1.2 million cases and 20,722 deaths, the Philippines has the second-highest Covid-19 infections and casualties in south-east Asia, behind Indonesia. People should be “very concerned” about the spread of the Indian variant of coronavirus, but “reassured” by the scale of the vaccine rollout, an expert has said. Professor Anthony Harnden, deputy chair of the UK’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), told BBC Breakfast that the variant was “clearly more transmissible”. He said: We need to be reassured that we’re in a very different position now in that we’ve got a highly vaccinated population and we just need to continue moving at speed. We do know that with this particular variant you do need two doses to offer complete protection, and so we’re very, very keen to make sure that all those, particularly higher risk groups, that’s the over-50s and those with underlying illness, receive their second vaccination as soon as feasible. The unlocking of society in England will be a “gradual process” that requires a “cautious” approach even if the government’s target date for removing all legal limits on social contact in the country on 21 June remains in place, he added, emphasising the need to “look very carefully” at what happens with the India variant in the next one or two weeks. He said: I think we need to look at that data very carefully before we completely un-lockdown. He suggested it was “better” to be on “the cautious side”, adding: Even if we do un-lockdown, if you are in a vulnerable position, particularly if you’ve not been vaccinated, you do need to carry on being cautious, even if the 21 June date goes ahead. So I think we’ve all got used to living within boundaries at the moment and I think it’s not an all or none, I think it will be a gradual process even if the 21 June date goes ahead. Scotland’s health secretary Humza Yousaf said there was “significant community transmission” of coronavirus in hotspots in the city of Glasgow. The city will remain under level 3 of Scotland’s restrictions until at least 5 June and Yousaf said urgent work was being carried out to understand the outbreak in south Glasgow and how the India variant arrived. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today: In a few concentrated hotspots ... we are seeing significant community transmission. The levels and the numbers of cases are continuing to rise. In other parts of the country “local health teams tell us they are relatively contained outbreaks” linked to either schools or domestic clusters, but that was not the case in Glasgow. What we are seeing is it’s coming in in areas where there is a large, diverse community so therefore there is a probability the variant has come in from international travel. Therefore we are trying to get to the bottom of how it managed to get in. Victoria state in Australia has recorded five new locally acquired cases of coronavirus, with four linked to a food distribution delivery driver, as the state enters its second day of its fourth lockdown. The update brings the total number of cases from the latest outbreak in Melbourne to 35. A record 56,624 tests were conducted in the 24 hours to Saturday morning, surpassing the previous day’s record of 47,462 tests. On Saturday, the state’s Covid testing commander, Jeroen Weimar, said four of the new cases were linked to a person who tested positive on Friday. The Victorian health minister, Martin Foley, said the person was a food distribution delivery driver who visited “multiple stores and grocery sites across metropolitan Melbourne on 18 and 19 May”. There are now more than 150 exposure sites and more than 15,000 primary and secondary contacts who must self-isolate after coming into potential contact with a person with Covid-19. Foley said the individual “worked during their infectious period” but they “showed no signs of Covid symptoms themselves”. He also thanked the food distribution company and customers for working with contact tracers. Weimar said four of the new cases announced on Saturday were household contacts of the delivery driver, including a student at Mount Ridley college in Craigieburn. He said these four people had only been in isolation for one day. The fifth case was separate, and was an employee of firm Stratton Finance who became infected at a display home in Mickleham. Late on Friday the Victorian health department announced new tier 1 exposure sites – where people are most at risk of catching and spreading the virus. A full list of exposure sites can be found here. Foley announced what he called a “hat-trick of records”, as the state administered a record number of tests and vaccinations over the past three days. Taiwan reported 486 new domestic Covid-19 cases on Saturday, including 166 cases added to the totals for recent days as it continues to readjust its infection numbers following delays in reporting positive tests. After successfully keeping coronavirus at bay, Taiwan is currently in the grip of its first serious outbreak. The island is desperately seeking vaccines to protect its people, and Taiwan’s neighbour China has offered to help, the BBC reported. Up until the mid-May, the country had logged only around 1,500 infections and 12 deaths, before cases began to rise sharply. On Tuesday, health minister Chen Shih-chung announced 2m vaccine doses would arrive in Taiwan in June, and 10m by the end of August. Russia reported 9,289 new Covid-19 cases on Saturday, including 3,241 in Moscow, taking the official national tally since the pandemic began to 5,053,748. The government coronavirus task force said 401 people had died of coronavirus-linked causes in the past 24 hours, pushing the national death toll to 120,807. The federal statistics agency has kept a separate count and has said Russia recorded around 250,000 deaths related to Covid-19 from April 2020 to March 2021. Malaysia reported 9,020 new coronavirus cases on Saturday, the highest daily toll since the start of the pandemic. This is the fifth straight day of record new infections, bringing the total number of cases in the country to 558,534. The country’s prime minister, Muhyiddin Yassin, has announced a nationwide “total lockdown” from 1 to 14 June that will apply to all social and economic areas, with only essential services and economic sectors listed by the national security council remaining in operation, ABC reports. “With the latest rise in daily cases showing a drastically upward trend, hospital capacity across the country to treat Covid-19 patients are becoming limited,” Muhyiddin said in a statement. Prof Stephen Reicher, a psychologist on the UK’s Sage sub-committee advising the government on behavioural science, said “confusion” over the government’s approach was undermining efforts to control the pandemic. Ahead of the planned 21 June easing of restrictions in England, he said the government was in a “pickle” because it appeared to have abandoned the “data, not dates” principle. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today: The data we are seeing at the moment suggests we have a problem. We don’t know how big the problem is - it might be bad, it might be very bad, we will learn in the next week or two. But the problem for the government is: on the one hand it can’t delay what it has been promising for so long, but on the other hand it is aware of the dangers of so doing. And so you see that in the fact that they are beginning to act in a rather contradictory way. They’re saying to us, for instance on travel: ‘you can travel internationally but please don’t’. They say of social contact ‘you can hug, but please don’t hug’. They say of restrictions, ‘no restrictions but please don’t go in and out of the hotspots’. That contradiction, that sense of confusion, I think is undermining the response. Hello and welcome to our global coronavirus live blog. Vietnam health minister Nguyen Thanh Long said on Saturday the country has detected a new variant of the coronavirus, which is a mix of the India and UK Covid-19 variants and spreads quickly by air, online newspaper VnExpress reported. Vietnam’s latest coronavirus wave, which began about a month ago, has seen 3,595 local Covid-19 cases so far in 33 cities and provinces. He said the coronavirus responsible for the new wave is much more transmissible, especially in the air. Viral cultures in the laboratory revealed that the virus replicated itself very quickly, he added, explaining why there are so many new cases in different locations in a shorter time frame. So far, Vietnam has recorded the presence of seven coronavirus variants, including ones from the UK, India and South Africa.

Caution is needed in determining whether England’s coronavirus restrictions can be lifted next month or “things will get bad very, very quickly”, a professor whose argument against herd immunity helped trigger the first lockdown has warned. Sir Tim Gowers, a professor of mathematics at the University of Cambridge, told the Guardian the downside of being “a bit more cautious” was a lot smaller than the downside of getting it wrong, as UK Covid cases rose by 4,184 on Friday – the highest increase since 1 April. Asked about the next step in lockdown easing in England, due on June 21, Prof Gowers said he did not believe the plans were necessarily at risk, but urged caution. He said: Because Boris Johnson has made a big thing about all the steps being irreversible, I think he’s put himself in a position where once he takes a step, he’ll be extremely reluctant to reverse because that would be a big U-turn, an embarrassing climbdown. So I think if that’s the way you’re going to play things, then you should be very, very cautious about every step you take ...

But no such dispensation for Chelsea - come on City!”</p> <p>Gary Byrne asks the big question: “Is John Terry in the stadium, full kit on?”</p> <p>And here’s Tim Daly: “Scott Carson is making his second appearance as a substitute keeper in a Champions League final, sixteen years on from a famous night in Istanbul.” Good spot, that. Should City win, Carson will beat the 14-year gap between brief goalkeeping appearances made by Jimmy Rimmer, who was reserve keeper for Manchester United against Benfica in 1968, then played the first nine minutes for Aston Villa against Bayern Munich in 1982 before his shoulder gave way, young Nigel Spink coming on to become the unlikely hero. If we see third-choice Carson in action tonight, it’ll be one hell of a story, one way or the other.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60b28a718f086d71cc15ea1a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-05-29T18:44:26.129Z\">7.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The pre-match thoughts of a slightly pensive Pep Guardiola ...</strong> “To have a chance to win the game, you have to attack.

We have to do it, they know it, and it’s good that they know it, because it’s their quality, their team effort that can decide this match on our side. We have gone for a little bit of height, Timo and Kai have a good feeling for each other. It is a tough choice to leave Christian Pulisic out, but we need 15 or 16 today to finish this game, hopefully in a positive way. I hope we can start strong, but finish even stronger.

For your future reference, I think a much better and more idiomatic translation into Portuguese would be ‘Temos jogo!’ (We’ve got a game!).”</p> <p>Meanwhile your memories of the 1986 Full Members’ Cup final have been flooding in, in their twos. “I was there!” writes Matthew Holt. “Pat Nevin put in about four unplayable crosses for our goals, then in the last five mins City started scoring and were only stopped by the final whistle. A repeat today please, with the ghost of Wee Pat putting in a few for Werner to finish off!”</p> <p>Our resident Fife, Angus and Perth &amp; Kinross correspondent Simon McMahon adds: “Five Scots in the Chelsea team for that Full Members’ Cup Final, including of course Johnny Marr lookalike Pat Nevin, whose autobiography, The Accidental Footballer, is excellent by the way. Billy McNeill managing City too. Billy Gilmour, the only Scottish representative on the bench for Chelsea tonight, could have a Champions League winners medal at age 19.

A shame in one respect, given the other-worldly Ataturk would have been a fitting venue for the denouement of an unearthly season … but a day on the Douro is one heck of a Plan B. Está ligado!</p> <p><strong>Manchester City are playing in their first European Cup final.</strong> It’s the end of a journey they began in 1968, when Malcolm Allison promised his and Joe Mercer’s English champions would set about Europe “as they have not been attacked since the days of the old Real Madrid … I think a lot of these European people are cowards.” Sure enough, having talked the big talk, they fell at the first hurdle against Fenerbahce. That brilliant Lee-Bell-Summerbee side brought home some European silverware in the end, winning the 1970 Cup Winners’ Cup, but that night <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2020/mar/21/chelsea-v-leeds-united-1970-fa-cup-final-replay-live\">everyone was watching the FA Cup final replay live in glorious technicolor on BBC1</a>, City’s 2-1 win over Gornik Zabrze relegated to late-night black-and-white highlights over on 2. Hapless happenstance always used to befall City back in the day.</p> <p><strong>Times change, though, and millions will be watching this evening as magisterial City finally look to make good on Allison’s words.</strong> City have scored 60 goals in their last 25 Champions League games. They’ve scored 25 in this campaign, letting in just four en route to the final. All this without a designated striker! They’re favourites tonight to win their second European bauble and their first European Cup.</p> <p><strong>Chelsea, playing in their third European Cup final, will have something to say about that.</strong> The Pensioners should have won the trophy in 2008, only for John Terry to freeze in the moment against Manchester United; they did lift it in 2012, Didier Drogba the imperious hero of the hour against Bayern Munich. Their run to the final this year has been the impressive equal of City, seeing off the new Spanish champions Atletico Madrid without too much fuss, while only profligate finishing prevented them from running up a cricket score against the famous Real Madrid. If they make it tonight, it’ll be their second European Cup and their sixth major European trophy in total, having won a couple of Europa Leagues (2013, 2019) and Cup Winners Cups (1971, 1998) in the past.</p> <p><strong>Chelsea go into this match having lost three of their last four matches, including a painful defeat in the FA Cup final, and a loss at Aston Villa which could have cost them a top-four place. </strong>Another reason City are favourites, then … until you consider their recent form against Pep Guardiola’s side: a 1-0 win in the FA Cup semi, and a 2-1 victory in the league at the Etihad.</p> <p><strong>It’s easy to make a case for either side, then, which is exactly as it should be ahead of the European Cup final.</strong> Team news and assorted blether to follow. Kick off is at 8pm (local and BST).

Commiserations to Manchester City, who will surely be back here again for another tilt at old big ears. One look over at Thomas Tuchel illustrates what a difference one single season can make. A reminder that David Hytner’s report has landed. Thanks for reading this MBM. Nighty night, and sweet dreams whoever you support, wherever you are. Pep Guardiola, deflated but gracious, speaks to BT Sport. “It was an exceptional season for us. It was an honour to be here. We are sad but it was a tight game. In the second half we were brilliant and brave but could not convert our goals because they are so fast and strong. Our players were exceptional, and maybe we will come back again one day. I did what is the best for the team. Kevin De Bruyne was injured but it happens. The ambition now is rest, but we will prepare for next season. It is the first time we were in this stage. It’s an honour to be here, and hopefully we will learn for the future.” Another trophy for Chelsea: N’Golo Kante has been named Uefa Player of the Match. No huge surprise; he was everywhere. David Hytner was at the Estádio do Dragão. His report is in. You know what to do! Chelsea’s second European Cup whisks them up the roll of honour. They’re still a ways behind 13-time winners Real Madrid, of course, but they’re now alongside some legendary names: Benfica, Nottingham Forest, Juventus, Porto. Manchester City meanwhile gain unwanted membership of the club featuring as-yet-winless finalists. Some big names in there too: among others, Fiorentina, Leeds, Borussia Monchengladbach, Roma, Arsenal, Spurs and PSG. Thomas Tuchel, blissfully spent, speaks to BT Sport. “This is unbelievable. To share it with everybody is unbelievable. I don’t know what to feel. I was so grateful to arrive a second time, but I had a feeling this was different. Somehow you could feel it, every day coming closer. The players were determined to win this, we wanted to be the stone in City’s shoe.” After three wins against City in six weeks, that quote’s a keeper, you suspect. Here’s Barney Ronay on Pep’s team selection: “A case of a man very publicly mugging himself.” Having waited patiently to see Chelsea lift the European Cup, Pep makes off down the tunnel with a wry smile etched across his face. Yet another year goes by without a third Champions League for the biggest managerial star in world football. Manchester City’s long wait to break their European Cup duck goes on too. Their fans have, pretty much to the last woman and man, left the stadium, perhaps with a view of drowning their sorrows. Sergio Aguero is still there, though, head bowed in despair as Chelsea and their fans bounce around to Blue is the Colour. Not the exit he’d dreamed of. Chelsea come up one by one, gold medals hung around their neck. Now they can touch and kiss the trophy ... then Cesar Azpilicueta gets to lift it! A small skip and a dainty jump, and then up goes the cup! Royal blue glitter, followed by blue and white fireworks, and the entire squad bounces around in wonder, preparing to take turns to lift the European Cup. The captain Cesar Azpilicueta adds: “I came after 2012 after the Champions League win and I wanted to repeat that. Tonight it is just amazing.” Then he pops off to hug his team-mates awhile. Eventually they detangle and form a guard of honour for the 2021 Champions League runners-up Manchester City. They receive their silver medals, disappointment the top note, Oleksandr Zinchenko in particular in bits. They’ve made it one step closer than ever before this year, but are still so far away. Next year, maybe. They’ll be one of the hot favourites as they go again. Chelsea are deserved winners of the 2021 Champions League. They were the better team for the vast majority of the match. N’Golo Kante ran the show. People will talk about Pep’s tinkering. Others will point to Antonio Rudiger’s block that took the unfortunate Kevin de Bruyne out of the game. Plenty to pick apart. But on the whole and in the round, Chelsea thoroughly deserve to be champions of Europe. “It’s an incredible feeling, we deserve it,” says the hero of the hour, Kai Havertz. BT Sport’s Des Kelly then points out that he’s pretty much paid back his big transfer fee. “To be honest right now, I don’t give a fuck about that, we won the fucking Champions League!” A magnificent two-swear combo with a broadcaster-baiting tariff of 5.8. As the Chelsea bench rushes en masse onto the field to celebrate, Pep warmly congratulates Tuchel. The German has done a number on him for the third time in the space of six weeks. Sergio Aguero is in tears. The fairytale wasn’t to be. Instead it’s a fairytale for Kai Havertz, who looks stunned - in a nice, mellow, stoned kind of way - as he considers his new status as Chelsea hero. An instant legend! That’s the last chance! Chelsea hold out, and have won their second European Cup! 90 min +6: Jesus battles hard down the inside-right channel. It’s a determined run. Christensen just about holds firm. The ball’s hacked out for another throw on the right. It’s flung back into the mixer. Chelsea allow it to bounce twice and can’t clear very far. Mahrez meets the dropping ball and, with Mendy on his knees, unable to respond, sends a screamer inches wide of the top right. So close to forcing extra time! 90 min +5: Another throw into the Chelsea box from the right. Stones and Dias sandwich Rudiger, who stays down for a bit. The referee may add on a bit of extra time for that over-reaction. 90 min +4: Fernandinho brings down Kante, allowing Chelsea to eat up a few more precious seconds. On the touchline, Tuchel, his temples red hot, veins at bursting point, asks the Chelsea crowd to make some more noise again. A brief, anxious roar. 90 min +3: City fling a long throw into the Chelsea box from the right. Some pinball. Chilwell hacks clear. Both teams are playing desperation football right now. 90 min +2: Jorginho goes down as though shot. He’s not been shot. He gets up as play goes on. 90 min +1: There’s also plenty of time for Chelsea to score a clincher, and with that in mind they launch a counter. It goes nowhere, but the clock ticks on. 90 min: Dias, in space on the left, fires a ball across the face of the goal. Foden tries so hard to trap and shoot on the right-hand corner of the six-yard box, but Christensen slides in to block. Then the board goes up: there will be seven added minutes. Plenty of time for City to save themselves! 89 min: Chelsea string together a series of passes deep in City territory. City can’t get hold of the ball, just when they need some precious possession. 88 min: Jesus is booked for coming through the back of Haverrtz, who takes his sweet time to bounce back up, in the classic clock-management style. 87 min: On the touchline, Thomas Tuchel turns to the Chelsea fans and energetically encourages them to make some more noise. Some arm waving, a couple of screams of COME ON, and the supporters oblige. 86 min: Walker, out on the right, sends a lovely inswinger towards Foden and Aguero, queuing on the edge of the six-yard box. Neither can meet it, and the ball flies out, wide left, for a goal kick. 85 min: James misjudges a diagonal ball, allowing Aguero to pick up possession to the left of the six-yard box. He’s got options in the middle, but floats a weak chip into Mendy’s hands. 84 min: Chelsea look comfortable again ... but there’s always one last chance in matches like this, isn’t there? 82 min: The free kick’s half cleared. Jorginho has a speculative boot from distance. Always heading wide left, but Chelsea are now 60 seconds closer to glory. “Aguero coming on sets up the potential for him to show that he can do a Panenka right,” suggests Peter Oh, as if our nerves aren’t already shredded enough. 81 min: Havertz has the chance to release Chilwell into space down the middle, but overcooks the pass in from the right. Chiwell races off after the ball, and is clipped by Walker out on the left. Free kick in a very dangerous position. 79 min: De Bruyne, towel draped over his shoulders, is taken down the steps, slowly and gingerly, towards the changing room. Such a sad sight. Meanwhile on comes Kovacic, finally getting some minutes in a Champions League final, after watching two for Real Madrid from the bench, for Mount. 78 min: Walker crosses from the right. Deflection. Corner. Mahrez takes ... and fails to beat the first man. Havertz, at the near post, heads clear. City have another new captain, by the way: the departing Sterling, having received the armband from De Bruyne, passes it on to Fernandinho. 76 min: Mount has a dig from distance. Wide left. Before Ederson can restart the game, on comes Sergio Aguero, taking Sterling’s place. A quarter of an hour to write one of the great fairytales, then. 74 min: Now City go up the other end and nearly create something, Sterling reaching the byline on the left and pulling back for Jesus ... but Chilwell gets in the road to clear. This game really is teetering in the balance. 73 min: Chelsea should be two up. They intercept and break, Havertz barging his way down the centre. He slips a pass to Pulisic, overlapping on his right. Pulisic strides into the box, draws Ederson and ... chips over the keeper but wide of the left-hand post. What a chance! 72 min: City continue to huff and puff. “Would anyone have dreamt that Fernandinho would be replacing Silva in the second half of a game that City are chasing?” asks Cameron Dunbar. “Not even saying it’s the wrong move, just a strange situation to be in. Shows you how badly Guardiola has gotten this in my opinion.” 70 min: Nothing comes from the resulting corner, then Azpilicueta is in shot again, having hurt his knee when challenging Jesus. For a second, it looks very serious, the referee responding to his screams by instantly waving the Chelsea physio on, but happily in turns out to be nothing more than some stinging post-impact pain. He’s back up soon enough. 68 min: City nearly open Chelsea up, Mount and Foden combining down the right channel, Mahrez whipping infield low and hard for Gundogan, waiting to tap in from six yards. Azpilicueta slides back and whips over the bar, a stunning intervention. 67 min: In the stand, De Bruyne presses a very large bag of ice on his left eye, which is surrounded by a Whizzer-and-Chips shiner. He’ll need a comic-book-size steak on that later. 66 min: Fernandinho’s first act is to fly into Jorginho. It’s late, but he does try to pull out at the last minute. Just a talking-to from the referee, nothing more. Then Chelsea make their second switch, replacing the erratic Werner with Pulisic. 65 min: City stroke it about, but it’s extremely sterile possession. 64 min: A second change for City, with Fernandinho coming on for Bernardo Silva. 62 min: You’ll hear more about Rudiger stepping in the way of De Bruyne, I’ll be bound. Here’s Alex Whitney: “That’s impressive: take an opposing player out of the game, but your team suffers nothing. Glorious example of how the rules of the game favour cynicism.” 60 min: Immediately from the restart, City’s new captain Sterling has a shot from the left-hand edge of the D. His effort is chested down by James. Huge appeals for a penalty, and VAR has a good, long look, but it’s nearly all chest, little or no arm. We play on. 59 min: This is awful to watch. De Bruyne has been given a proper old-fashioned shiner, and he’s extremely groggy. He can’t continue. He leaves the scene in tears, discombobulated and stunned, consumed by sorrow. Jesus comes on in his wake. 58 min: ... but De Bruyne has taken an even bigger whack, and he’s still down receiving treatment. A very worrying moment for City. “It seems like Pep has painted himself into a corner,” argues Luke Jones. “His starting lineup was heavy on attacking. But now looking at his bench, he doesn’t have a lot of great options that would be a clear improvement to their offense, unless you believe in a sentimental Aguero moment.” 56 min: Rudiger cynically checks De Bruyne, who was trying to make ground down the right. A double punishment, as he takes quite a whack as the pair collide at speed, and it’s a yellow when the defender gets back up. 55 min: Gundogan gives away a free kick out on the right, clipping Havertz’s heel. Nothing comes of the resulting set piece, but Gundogan has to be careful seeing he’s on a yellow. 53 min: Now it’s Dias’s turn to execute a world-class slide, as he pokes the ball away from Werner, who was threatening to break free down the right, chasing after James’ long pass. 52 min: De Bruyne lengthens his stride and begins to look very dangerous as he sashays down the inside-left channel. But just as he shapes to shoot, Kante comes sliding in from behind and hooks away sensationally. As good a tackle as you’ll see. 51 min: Chelsea look fairly comfortable at the moment. City haven’t created anything of note since the restart. Guardiola may be considering a change. 49 min: City knock it around but Chelsea hold their shape and there’s no way through. Eventually Walker swings in from the right but it’s an easy claim for Mendy, with nobody in sky blue sniffing around. Penny for the thoughts of Sergio Aguero. 48 min: In fact De Bruyne dummies it and leaves Foden to take instead. Foden can’t beat first man Kante, and what a waste that is. 47 min: Sterling busies himself down the left and is gently tugged by James. All’s fair in love and war, so down he goes. Free kick. De Bruyne to take. Chelsea get the second half underway. A reminder that if the teams are level after 90 minutes, it’s 30 minutes of extra time and possibly penalties. There have been no half-time changes, but there could be plenty to come: each team are allowed to make five subs, with a sixth permissible if we go to extra time. Half-time entertainment. As things stand, it’s one heck of a day for west London. Paul Doyle was at Wembley to see Brentford finally make it to the promised land of the Premier League. Here’s his take on an excellent performance from the Bees. City look a little stunned as they make their way down the tunnel, Pep having very quickly disappeared down it beforehand. Chelsea stroll off, ten feet tall. A gorgeous Kai Havertz finish is the difference; Chelsea are 45 minutes away from their second European Cup! City have some thinking to do. 45 min +1: Kante chips in cutely from the right. Werner chests down, just by the edge of the six-yard box. He turns, and shanks a dismal effort wide right. He’s been involved constantly since the get-go, impressing in every aspect other than his shooting. A big caveat admittedly, but he’s an undoubted presence up front. 45 min: Chelsea won’t want to hear the half-time whistle, but it’ll be coming in three minutes time. On the touchline, Pep looks extremely concerned. 44 min: That’s a lovely goal. Ederson had come racing out of his box, and the ball hit his arm, although he was trying to withdraw it. Havertz could also have gone over, in a cynical attempt to get the keeper sent off. So it could have been worse for City. But here we are. Silva screams at his team-mates to pick up their heads, while the Dragao erupts! Chelsea ping it around patiently ... then spring forward! Mendy passes wide left to Chilwell, who finds Mount infield. Mount spins and plays a first-time ball down the inside-left channel. Havertz races after it, though a huge gap in the City defence caused by Werner’s decoy run to the left. Ederson comes to the edge of the box, but Havertz rounds him on the left and rolls into an empty net! 40 min: Chilwell crosses deep from the left. Werner tries to cushion the ball into the path of Havertz, but the two Chelsea forwards are too close to each other, and a baroque mess ensues. Chelsea have attacked well; they’ve just been unable to find that final ball. 39 min: Poor old Silva can’t continue. He’s close to tears as he motions to the bench, then trudges off, but it doesn’t stop him making a special beeline towards his replacement Christensen, wishing him all the best. 37 min: City have enjoyed 58 percent of possession so far. No huge surprises here. Chelsea are quite happy to wait for a chance to counter, and here they come, snaffling the ball, Kante gliding upfield with options either side. He looks for Havertz down the inside-right, Zinchenko recovering and blocking. That’s a fine last-ditch tackle, though Kante should perhaps have used one of his options to the left instead. 36 min: Silva isn’t happy. It’s not his shoulder; it’s a pull in the groin. He’s feeling his Special Area gingerly, and wincing quite a lot. He’s going to continue for now, though Chelsea have sent Andreas Christensen and Kurt Zouma out to warm up, just in case. 34 min: Gundogan high-kicks Mount to the floor as Chelsea build an attack from deep. VAR has a look at a possible red-card offence, but it’s just a yellow for a kick on the knee. 32 min: Now it’s Chelsea’s turn to take a little sting out of the game with some sterile stuff at the back. After that flurry of City action, they need the breather. 31 min: Walker turns on the jets and speeds past Chilwell down the right. He almost literally sends Chilwell spinning like a top in his slipstream. What determination ... and what a cross he fizzes along the face of the six-yard box. Mahrez is inches away from sliding to connect with his toe. If he hadn’t cut his toenails last night, it was 1-0. 29 min: After a slow start, it’s safe to say City have woken up. They’re beginning to get a lot of joy down their left flank. 27 min: Sterling turns on the burners and tries to make his way past James on the outside. He nearly manages it, but James battles well to fend him off. City come again, immediately, De Bruyne slipping a pass down the left channel for Foden, who is suddenly free in the box! But only for a split second. Foden looks to pass across Mendy and into the bottom right, but his shot is blocked by an absurdly good last-ditch challenge by Rudiger, whose telescopic leg balloons the ball into the arms of his keeper. 26 min: James curls in. City clear, then swarm upfield. In a matter of milliseconds, the ball’s been shuttled back to the feet of Mendy. For all the open, fun play, neither keeper has had a serious save to make yet. 25 min: Chelsea buzz around, and eventually a frustrated Dias comes out to bowl Kante to the ground. A free kick in a dangerous position out on the right. They load the box. “I can’t but root for Thiago Silva,” begins Kári Tulinius. “While I’ve probably watched him play hundreds of matches during his long career, the image of him that always comes to mind is of him in the stands at the 2014 World Cup semi-final against Germany, helplessly watching as his Brazilian team mates gave a masterclass in inept defending. I don’t think I’ve stopped feeling sorry for him since. I hope he gets a gold medal tonight.” 23 min: Havertz finds a little space up the other end and rolls wide to the lively Chilwell, whose cross isn’t up to much. But Chelsea quickly come again, James crossing from the right, Havertz winding his neck back in the hope of heading home. Stones eyebrows clear, just in time. 21 min: So having said that, here’s some space for De Bruyne down the left, sent away by Sterling. De Bruyne reaches the byline and forces a corner, but turns out he went a little early and the flag goes up for offside. “Nearly 20 minutes gone, and I don’t think Werner’s been caught offside yet? No one saw that coming.” Matt Dony, ladies and gentlemen. He’s here all week. Try the Francesinha. 19 min: De Bruyne and Sterling combine crisply down the left, but there’s little space in which to create, and Azpilicueta is over quickly to blooter clear. A couple of City frowns already, as they struggle to make things happen in the Chelsea final third. 17 min: Both teams are pressing manically. A lot of misplaced passes as a result. A lot of highly decent first-time ones, too, though, and Chilwell finds Mount down the left. Werner is nearly sent clear with a slide down the channel, but he cuts back for Chilwell, who curls long to the far post. Kante, of all people, arrives to head high and wide. Chelsea have been excellent in these opening exchanges. 15 min: Werner could easily have had a couple of goals already, and here he is winning a corner, troubling Stones down the left and flashing towards the bottom left. The ball’s deflected out for a corner, from which ... Ederson claims and City break! De Bruyne tries to dribble into the box from the right but is stopped by Kante. This is wonderfully open, with both teams going for it. 14 min: Chelsea come at City again, Mount nicking the ball off Mahrez, Chilwell bombing down the inside-left channel. He cuts back for Werner, who tries to pass first time into the bottom left. Ederson reads him and saves. 12 min: Stones errs again, struggling to keep his balance while Werner attacks him down the right. The City defender does just about enough to keep Werner from finding the killer pass infield, but this is a shaky start by Stones. Werner, that absurd miss apart, has looked extremely lively. 10 min: Now it’s Chelsea’s turn to launch long. Stones fluffs his clearance, allowing Havertz to slide down the left and pull back for Werner, who should score from six yards, but takes a fresh-air swipe. The act of a confidence-free player. City go up the other end, countering through Sterling, but his ball inside is whipped clear by Rudiger. Good fun, this! 8 min: Ederson plays a long pass down the middle, and releases Sterling. Simple as that! Sterling can’t bring it down cleanly, allowing James, in pursuit, to block out for a corner. Had Sterling taken that in his stride, in the Suarez-versus-Newcastle style, he was in on goal. Easier said than done. Nothing comes from the corner. 7 min: Walker gets the better of Silva down the right, but the play’s pulled back for a foul. A light tug on the Brazilian defender’s shoulder. Silva holds it while grimacing in pain, but is good to continue right now. There didn’t seem too much in that, but there we are. 5 min: The start’s been a bit hectic for City’s liking, so they slow it down with some sterile possession across the back. A few early nerves need settling. 4 min: More space for Werner down the right. He scampers to the byline and pulls back for Havertz, who can’t control properly, and the ball squirts into the hands of Ederson. Chelsea will be enthused by those two early Werner bursts. 3 min: Chelsea gather themselves and launch the first attacking sortie of the evening, Werner grooving his way down the right. Stones shuts the door. 1 min: A slightly nervous start by Chelsea as they play the ball across their back line in not-particularly-convincing fashion, City pressing hard. They get away with it. Both sets of fans giving it plenty. City kick off ... but only after the knee is taken. There’s no room for racism. Challenge it. Report it. Change it. Kick it out. A smattering of boos, but they’re drowned out by a much louder wave of applause. Here come the teams! Bedlam at the Dragao, despite the limited capacity. One hell of a reception. City fans are so excited they don’t bother booing the official Uefa Champions League anthem that much. Captains Kevin De Bruyne and Cesar Azpilicueta exchange pennants. Coins are tossed, fists bumped. We’ll be off in a minute. Temos jogo! “Vamos jogar is better,” argues Tim Stappard. Another dip into the pre-match postbag. “What a day to be a Fulham supporter: Brentford in the play-off final and Chelsea in the Champions League final,” begins Richard Hirst. “Much as I grieve at Brentford being a division above Fulham, they probably deserve it after all their near misses. And my goddaughter and family are Brentford supporters, so love trumps local rivalry. But no such dispensation for Chelsea - come on City!” Gary Byrne asks the big question: “Is John Terry in the stadium, full kit on?” And here’s Tim Daly: “Scott Carson is making his second appearance as a substitute keeper in a Champions League final, sixteen years on from a famous night in Istanbul.” Good spot, that. Should City win, Carson will beat the 14-year gap between brief goalkeeping appearances made by Jimmy Rimmer, who was reserve keeper for Manchester United against Benfica in 1968, then played the first nine minutes for Aston Villa against Bayern Munich in 1982 before his shoulder gave way, young Nigel Spink coming on to become the unlikely hero. If we see third-choice Carson in action tonight, it’ll be one hell of a story, one way or the other. The pre-match thoughts of a slightly pensive Pep Guardiola ... “To have a chance to win the game, you have to attack. Of course you have to defend, we need everyone. I am sure the second half will be very different than the beginning. Chelsea play five in the back, we need specific players in that area.” ... and a relaxed, smiling Thomas Tuchel, both men talking to BT Sport. “We had some final words, but everything is said now. We have to do it, they know it, and it’s good that they know it, because it’s their quality, their team effort that can decide this match on our side. We have gone for a little bit of height, Timo and Kai have a good feeling for each other. It is a tough choice to leave Christian Pulisic out, but we need 15 or 16 today to finish this game, hopefully in a positive way. I hope we can start strong, but finish even stronger. It’s a huge opponent, a big game in Europe, and we are up for it.” A peek inside the Chelsea dressing room. City are the designated home side, but both teams will be able to play in their first-choice colours. As in the Premier League, it’s been decided there’s no clash between the sky blue of City and Chelsea’s royal hue. Petr Cech, Chelsea’s technical advisor and hero of 2012, talks to BT Sport, and appears up for this. “The last step is usually the hardest one. There is a big chance the game will go to penalties. I hope the team is ready and confident that we will win it. Manchester City are a tough team to beat. It will be an entertaining game, even though you expect it to be a tactical game.” A dip into the pre-match postbag. We’ll get to tonight’s match in good time, but first thing’s first. “As an English translator, resident in Lisbon for many years, I feel I must help with your translation of ‘It’s on’,” begins John Elliott, who may or may not have twigged that I don’t speak a word of Portuguese and was wholly reliant on Google Translate. “‘Ligado’ is ‘on’ in the sense of ‘electrically’ on or off. For your future reference, I think a much better and more idiomatic translation into Portuguese would be ‘Temos jogo!’ (We’ve got a game!).” Meanwhile your memories of the 1986 Full Members’ Cup final have been flooding in, in their twos. “I was there!” writes Matthew Holt. “Pat Nevin put in about four unplayable crosses for our goals, then in the last five mins City started scoring and were only stopped by the final whistle. A repeat today please, with the ghost of Wee Pat putting in a few for Werner to finish off!” Our resident Fife, Angus and Perth &amp; Kinross correspondent Simon McMahon adds: “Five Scots in the Chelsea team for that Full Members’ Cup Final, including of course Johnny Marr lookalike Pat Nevin, whose autobiography, The Accidental Footballer, is excellent by the way. Billy McNeill managing City too. Billy Gilmour, the only Scottish representative on the bench for Chelsea tonight, could have a Champions League winners medal at age 19. Doubt Nevin would swap his Full Members gong though.” Johnny Marr is a City fan, of course. I am The Weaver. Everyone thought Pep had given up tinkering, which hasn’t always been a successful pastime for him in this competition, but there’s a big surprise: a very attacking line-up with no holding player. Neither Fernandinho nor Rodri starts, which suggests Pep is expecting his side to enjoy the lion’s share of possession. That’s a brave call, as he’ll have to field a fair few questions should this go wrong. Ilkay Gundogan is fit after limping out of training yesterday, Raheem Sterling starts, Oleksandr Zinchenko gets the nod at left-back, and if Sergio Aguero is to be the epochal hero again, he’ll need to come on and do it as a sub. Another 94th-minute winner, anyone? Chelsea’s selection is comparatively understated. N’Golo Kante and Edouard Mendy are fit to play. Ben Chilwell is picked ahead of Marcos Alonso, while Timo Werner and Kai Havertz are the ones stationed up front alongside Mason Mount. Manchester City: Ederson, Walker, Dias, Stones, Zinchenko, Gundogan, De Bruyne, Bernardo, Mahrez, Sterling, Foden. Subs: Steffen, Carson, Ake, Jesus, Aguero, Laporte, Rodrigo, Torres, Mendy, Fernandinho, Cancelo, Garcia. Chelsea: Mendy, James, Thiago Silva, Rudiger, Azpilicueta, Kante, Jorginho, Chilwell, Mount, Havertz, Werner. Subs: Arrizabalaga, Alonso, Christensen, Pulisic, Caballero, Zouma, Kovacic, Giroud, Hudson-Odoi, Ziyech, Gilmour, Emerson Palmieri. Referee: Antonio Miguel Mateu Lahoz (Valencia). Manchester City and Chelsea have previously met in two other finals. There was the absurdity of the 2019 League Cup final, which City won on penalties but is already only remembered for the preposterous row between Maurizio Sarri and Kepa, who refused to come off. But never mind that. The big one was the 1986 Full Members’ Cup final, a nine-goal thriller that may never be topped in the eyes of a certain generation. Chelsea and City have come a long way since, but some things remain golden, no matter what. As for the managers themselves ... well, we all remember Thomas Tuchel sitting on the PSG icebox last year, his leg all bound up like the farmer in Withnail &amp; I. He’s zero for one, though by making it back immediately with Chelsea, he becomes the first man to take different clubs to the final in successive seasons. Pep Guardiola meanwhile is making his third appearance as a boss at the final, having won the thing with Barcelona in 2009 and 2011. If he makes it a hat-trick of wins today, he’ll become only the sixth coach in history to win the European Cup with two different clubs, getting his name on an elite list that so far includes Ernst Happel (Feyenoord 1970, Hamburg 1983), Ottmar Hitzfeld (Borussia Dortmund 1997, Bayern Munich 2001), José Mourinho (Porto 2004, Internazionale 2010), Jupp Heynckes (Real Madrid 1998, Bayern 2013) and Carlo Ancelotti (AC Milan 2003 and 2007, Real Madrid 2014). Throw in a couple of appearances as a player, winning in 1992 and losing in 1994 with Barca, and that’s quite the relationship with Europe’s showpiece event. This is virgin territory for nearly everyone involved (if you ignore the managers, that is). Only one member of each squad has previously played in a Champions League final, and neither has particularly happy memories. İlkay Gündoğan turned out for Borussia Dortmund in 2013, scoring from the penalty spot in their 2-1 defeat by Bayern Munich. Thiago Silva meanwhile was captain of the Paris Saint-Germain team that lost to the very same Bavarian party-poopers last year. Mateo Kovačić was there for Real Madrid in 2017 and 2018, but only looking on as an unused substitute. Chelsea fans are also enjoying their big day out. Here’s one getting the top of his head coloured in. We’re assuming, given the ITV ident craze sweeping Porto, he asked for the LWT ribbon, only to be told the artist had no orange paint. No matter: Stamford the Lion will offer plenty of protection from those harmful UV rays, because it’s been a lovely warm and gloriously sunny day in Porto. Perfect conditions for the biggest game on the calendar. Fans of both teams have been out on the Super Bock. Here’s the best-dressed one. Apt, too. Granada were prime movers in the popularisation of the European Cup, their cameras on hand to transmit the exploits of the Busby Babes, Old Trafford being just down the road. The second leg of the 1957 semi between United and Real Madrid was the first to be transmitted live in its entirety on the all-new ITV, though only in the Granada region. The first four minutes were missed; well, there were ads still to show, and the ref wasn’t in the mood to delay kick-off, a decision that would have necessitated standing around in the cold. Welcome to our live MBM coverage of the 29th Champions League final … or if we’re doing things properly, paying proper heed to history and romance, the 66th European Cup final. Had things gone smoothly, we’d be at the Ataturk in Istanbul for the latest edition of the biggest and most glamorous club match in world football, but coronavirus has put paid to that, and so everyone’s made it to the easier-to-access Estádio do Dragão in Porto instead. A shame in one respect, given the other-worldly Ataturk would have been a fitting venue for the denouement of an unearthly season … but a day on the Douro is one heck of a Plan B. Está ligado! Manchester City are playing in their first European Cup final. It’s the end of a journey they began in 1968, when Malcolm Allison promised his and Joe Mercer’s English champions would set about Europe “as they have not been attacked since the days of the old Real Madrid … I think a lot of these European people are cowards.” Sure enough, having talked the big talk, they fell at the first hurdle against Fenerbahce. That brilliant Lee-Bell-Summerbee side brought home some European silverware in the end, winning the 1970 Cup Winners’ Cup, but that night everyone was watching the FA Cup final replay live in glorious technicolor on BBC1, City’s 2-1 win over Gornik Zabrze relegated to late-night black-and-white highlights over on 2. Hapless happenstance always used to befall City back in the day. Times change, though, and millions will be watching this evening as magisterial City finally look to make good on Allison’s words. City have scored 60 goals in their last 25 Champions League games. They’ve scored 25 in this campaign, letting in just four en route to the final. All this without a designated striker! They’re favourites tonight to win their second European bauble and their first European Cup. Chelsea, playing in their third European Cup final, will have something to say about that. The Pensioners should have won the trophy in 2008, only for John Terry to freeze in the moment against Manchester United; they did lift it in 2012, Didier Drogba the imperious hero of the hour against Bayern Munich. Their run to the final this year has been the impressive equal of City, seeing off the new Spanish champions Atletico Madrid without too much fuss, while only profligate finishing prevented them from running up a cricket score against the famous Real Madrid. If they make it tonight, it’ll be their second European Cup and their sixth major European trophy in total, having won a couple of Europa Leagues (2013, 2019) and Cup Winners Cups (1971, 1998) in the past. Chelsea go into this match having lost three of their last four matches, including a painful defeat in the FA Cup final, and a loss at Aston Villa which could have cost them a top-four place. Another reason City are favourites, then … until you consider their recent form against Pep Guardiola’s side: a 1-0 win in the FA Cup semi, and a 2-1 victory in the league at the Etihad. It’s easy to make a case for either side, then, which is exactly as it should be ahead of the European Cup final. Team news and assorted blether to follow. Kick off is at 8pm (local and BST).

Why Pep? Why do it to yourself? On a soft, balmy, thrillingly boisterous night in the suburbs of Porto, the defining tactical brain of the age sent out the strongest squad in Europe to face a team that had lost three of its last four games. And yet again, he blinked. Porto is a sleepy town, the only real disturbance in the past few days some gentle English infighting.

At which point, enter the black cloud. Hello doubt, my old friend. I’ve been expecting you.</p> <p>Pep went full Pep here. When the City team dropped 10 minutes before 7pm there was a tremor of electricity around this vast, thrilling open bowl with its flying concrete roof, its cinematic sun strips. Chelsea would be fielding seven defensive players to City’s four. The starting midfield three would be Phil Foden, Ilkay Gündogan and Bernardo Silva.</p> <p>On paper there was only one real change, with Raheem Sterling in and Fernandino or Rodri absent.

Why Pep? Why do it to yourself? On a soft, balmy, thrillingly boisterous night in the suburbs of Porto, the defining tactical brain of the age sent out the strongest squad in Europe to face a team that had lost three of its last four games. And yet again, he blinked. Porto is a sleepy town, the only real disturbance in the past few days some gentle English infighting. But this was a case of a man very publicly mugging himself. This City team has been irresistible for the last five months, has found a shape, a system, a set of rhythms that have carried them though the field without breaking stride. At which point, enter the black cloud. Hello doubt, my old friend. I’ve been expecting you. Pep went full Pep here. When the City team dropped 10 minutes before 7pm there was a tremor of electricity around this vast, thrilling open bowl with its flying concrete roof, its cinematic sun strips. Chelsea would be fielding seven defensive players to City’s four. The starting midfield three would be Phil Foden, Ilkay Gündogan and Bernardo Silva. On paper there was only one real change, with Raheem Sterling in and Fernandino or Rodri absent. But with that stroke Guardiola had removed an entire position, going into a Champions League final without a single defensive midfielder. Guardiola didn’t just take the handbrake off here. He sheared it off with an angle-grinder, set about it with a mallet and hurled it out of the passenger window. Even stranger, he did this against a team strong enough to defeat City twice recently. The deepest defensive midfielder was also City’s top goalscorer. It looked muddled, a City team that was all ragu, no linguine. What about things like balance and ballast? What about safety? What about playing by the rules? And fine, if we’re not playing by the rules, how about trying it out once or twice before the biggest game of your post-Barca career? There were 16,500 people at the Estádio do Dragão but it felt like more, such was the agreeable sensory shock at being there out in all that space and light and noise. It was a feeling of vagueness that seemed to transmit to City’s players. The midfield looked like a three, then became a one with two in front for a while. It was fluid, it was loose, it was a kind of controlled whirl, the kind of rhythms that liberate players but also make huge demands of their in-game intelligence, the ability to read the flow. The first chance of the game came from a long pass down the middle from the goalkeeper. Sterling really should have controlled the ball better and had a shot. And then for a while City just kind of fell apart. Suddenly there were spaces, channels, rivulets opening up in the backline. Three times Chelsea were able to carve a way through, let down on each occasion by Timo Werner’s reverse-Terminator impression, the man who can’t be called off but repeatedly refuses to kill you. He really should have scored twice and set the day decisively one way. Throughout all this Pep was up on his feet in full crazed modernist-conductor guise, strutting left to right in skinny black match-day duds then suddenly whirling and lunging, doing rapid-fire double-handed midge-swats, pointing at things only he could see: objects, planes, holes, possibilities. And as half-time approached Chelsea scored the goal they’d been almost but not quite scoring for the past 42 minutes. It was startlingly easy, made by a single, simple pass that cut through the heart of this City formation like a hot knife through butter made specifically, and to order, without any added Fernandinho. Mason Mount, who had been busy and smart and neat all game, had so much time, too much time, the kind of time that breaks these games open. A kind of slackness had developed, a hole in City’s shared energy field. Mount picked out Kai Havertz making a wonderful driving run through the City midfield. The ball travelled 45 yards along the ground uninterrupted, straight into that rangy, eager stride, the stride of a Victorian housemaster completing a particularly rugged early morning cross country dash. There was no flesh, no obstacle, no parts of this City team to create resistance. Havertz rounded Ederson and rolled the ball into an empty net.

The pair are said to have exchanged vows in front of a small group of close friends and family, the Mail on Sunday and the Sun newspaper have reported. The ceremony had been planned for six months and a handful of church officials were involved in the preparation, according to the Sun. The 30 guests invited, the maximum number under current lockdown restrictions, are said to have been informed only at the last minute. It comes just days after reports said the prime minister and Symonds had sent save-the-date cards to family and friends for an event on 30 July 2022. The newspaper also reported that, shortly after 1.30pm, staff at the cathedral told visitors to evacuate as the building was going into lockdown. A limousine transporting Symonds, 33, arrived at the piazza outside the main west door. The couple’s year-old son Wilfred is believed to have attended the nuptials along with two official witnesses. The ceremony was reportedly carried out by Father Daniel Humphreys who had baptised Wilfred last year. One witness told the newspaper: “It was closed for about half an hour and they all came out after. It’s not very often we have weddings here, and when they came out they were all bungled into a car.” Symonds is a former press adviser to the Conservative party and masterminded broadcast coverage for the party during the 2015 general election. The marriage to Symonds is Johnson’s third. He first married at the age of 23 to Allegra Mostyn-Owen in 1987. The wedding was annulled in 1993 following claims he was having an affair with lawyer and childhood friend Marina Wheeler, whom he married in 1993. The couple have four children. They separated in 2018 and were divorced in 2020. The Northern Ireland first minister, Arlene Foster and work and pensions secretary Therese Coffey were among those to tweet their congratulations to the couple. Labour former frontbencher Jon Trickett tweeted that the wedding was “a good way to bury this week’s bad news” on Dominic Cummings’ testimony, the spread of the India coronavirus variant and the row about funding of the Downing Street flat. A Downing Street spokesperson would not comment on the reports when asked by the Guardian.","charCount":"2344","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/nadeembadshah\">Nadeem Badshah</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2021/may/30/the-psychologists-signing-up-for-psychedelic-therapy-training-amazing-things-can-happen","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-29T20:00:36Z","webTitle":"The psychologists signing up for psychedelic therapy training: ‘Amazing things can happen’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/may/30/the-psychologists-signing-up-for-psychedelic-therapy-training-amazing-things-can-happen","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2021/may/30/the-psychologists-signing-up-for-psychedelic-therapy-training-amazing-things-can-happen","fields":{"headline":"The psychologists signing up for psychedelic therapy training: ‘Amazing things can happen’","standfirst":"<p>The global renaissance of psychedelic drugs in the treatment of mental health gains further legitimacy in Australia as psychologists sign up for clinical trials</p>","trailText":"The global renaissance of psychedelic drugs in the treatment of mental health gains further legitimacy in Australia as psychologists sign up for clinical trials","byline":"Jenny Valentish","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c452f9cc2056484da772d4259d4350da02aaf952\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c452f9cc2056484da772d4259d4350da02aaf952/0_162_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dr David Spektor\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dr David Spektor will participate as a clinical psychologist in a research trial involving MDMA with PTSD sufferers and their therapy. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Hopkins/The  Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>When growing up in Yea, in rural Victoria, Campbell Townsend took a dim view of drugs.</p> <p>“My parents were born in the shadow of Nixon’s war on drugs, and I was a very simple country boy,” the psychologist says, sitting in his cottage outside Castlemaine. “I grew up with stories from my parents about friends of theirs at university going crazy just from one choof of a bong.”<br><br>Townsend’s fears persisted until he read journalist Michael Pollan’s 2018 book, How to Change Your Mind: The New Science of Psychedelic<em>s</em>.

Pant isn’t sure where the training will take her yet, though she’d like to work with a team, such as through a retreat.

The office of Jacinda Ardern confirmed to the Guardian that her country’s position had not changed – the longstanding offer to accept 150 refugees from Australia’s offshore islands each year still stood – but declined to confirm whether it was on the agenda for the New Zealand prime minister’s meeting with her Australian counterpart on Sunday. “We don’t discuss the content of bilaterals before they take place.” Ardern and Scott Morrison will meet on Sunday and Monday in Queenstown. Nine years after Australia restarted offshore processing, and more than seven years since the last asylum seeker was sent offshore, 239 refugees and asylum seekers remain held within Australia’s offshore islands processing regime: 109 on Nauru and 130 in Papua New Guinea. According to government figures, 1,223 “transitory persons” are in Australia, brought back from offshore processing islands. This cohort might also be considered – by Australia at least – as candidates for resettlement. Australia has repeatedly said it would consider resettling refugees in New Zealand only after its 2016 deal with the US was extinguished. Under the Obama-era deal – condemned as “horrible” and “disgusting” but ultimately honoured by his successor, Donald Trump – the US has agreed to take up to 1,250 refugees from Australia’s offshore system, in exchange for Australia accepting refugees from the “northern triangle” of Central America held in US-run camps. The US has so far resettled 936 refugees from Australia, and a further 258 have been provisionally accepted. That would bring the number resettled in America to 1,194, close to the deal’s cap. US sources with knowledge of the program say that despite the Biden administration increasing the size of its refugee resettlement program for 2021, there will be no additional places for refugees held by Australia. In October 2020 the secretary of Australia’s home affairs department, Mike Pezzullo, confirmed to a Senate estimates hearing that Australia would consider the New Zealand resettlement offer – to accept 150 refugees from offshore each year – once the US deal was extinguished. “The Australian government is grateful for that offer from the government of New Zealand … it’s an offer that remains under active consideration.” The home affairs deputy secretary Marc Ablong told the Senate: “We are getting close to the end of the program.

Last time Australia ran an offshore detention program, between 2001 and 2007, several hundred refugees were ultimately resettled in New Zealand. And at least one, high-profile, refugee from Australia’s most recent offshore detention regime has already resettled in New Zealand.

She meets Serena or Rybakina next. This has accelerated quickly; Pavlyuchenkova now has three match points... Suddenly Pavlyuchenkova is nearly there! She plays a terrific game to break again, a cross-court forehand winner sealing the deal, and in 90 seconds she’ll serve for the last eight. Angry Azarenka is best Azarenka and she quickly raises a break-back point only to miss her backhand return – a significant oversight – and one compounded by one into the net that hands Pavlyuchenkova advantage. A squeal follows, and seconds later the gap is two games at 4-2 while, on Lenglen, Vondrousova has taken the second set. Now then. Azarenkafinds herself with a break point which she tamely spurns, then minutes later is facing two and pulls a forehand into the net. Pavlyuchenkova leads the decider 3-2 with a breakl, while Vondrousova has consolidated to 5-2 in set two. Badosa is so good under pressure, which is to say that on those occasions, she does pretty much what she always does. She saved a couple of break pints in her previous service game and powers through three more here ... but you can only outrun opportunity for so long, and Vondrousova’s forehand gives her 4-2 in set two. I really like the look of Badosa, who has weapons and moxie; she trusts her forehand to extricate her from a break point-down situation, then unfurls a lovely backhand for advantage and quickly closes out. Girl can play. We’re on serve in both our matches currently, Badosa leading VondRoursova 6-4 1-2 with Azarenka and Pavlyuchenkova 1-1 in their decider. Dearie me; Azarenka fights back from 40-0 to 40-30, steps in to face a second serve, then well in the rally whacks a backhand long. But that works nicely for us because we now get to enjoy a decider. Azarenka 7-5 3-6 Pavlyuchenkova Badosa, meanwhile, saves two break-back points in fine style – she runs onto the ball beautifully and addresses it with power before clinching the set with a lob. Excellent work from her – she looks comfortably the superior player now. Azarenka plays a miserable game to hand Pavlyuchenkova three break points and she saves two really well ... but a very tight double ruins her good work; Pavlyuchenkova will now serve for the second set. Azarenka gets to 30-all in Pavlyuchenkova’s next service game but a pair of decent first serves snuff her out. Meanwhile, Badosa is well on top now, and at 15-40 Vondrousova hauls a forehand wide so that she’ll now serve for the first set at at 5-4. “After last night’s match, Federer said he wasn’t sure if he would play his fourth round match against Berrettini,” emails James Ferguson, “citing the fact that there is not a week off in between the French Open and Halle, where he has committed to playing. Following his lead, do you reckon I can get away with emailing my Swiss boss for a week off before our next big meeting?” I’m not sure a week is sufficient to ensure adequate preparation. Badosa is getting the measure of Vondrousova now, picking her drops and such – they’re at 3-3 – while Azarenka has recorded the fourth straight break in her match with Pavlyuchenkova so now trails 2-3 having won set one. And the Azerbaijan land of fire GP: Also going on: the final day of England v New Zealand which might just yield a positive result. Badosa breaks back immediately with the help of a double fault, while Pavlyuchenkova has broken Azarenka again to nudge in front in set two. Vondrousova’s composure is working better than Badosa’s power, and she’s just broken for 3-1. Excellent from Pavlyuchenkova, who breaks immediately in set two ... then finds herself playing deuce as she tries to consolidate. A banging forehand down the line gives Azarenka a chance to resolve things, and a really tame backhand hands her the game. Azarenka 7-5 1-2 Pavlyuchenkova A lot of people are high on Badosa, and I can’t wait to see how she does against the wily lefty behaviour of Vondrousova. Vondrousova 1-0 Badosa Azarenka is struggling here, Pavlyuchenkova sticking away at backhand at the net for a break-back point ... only to net a backhand return. But she quickly arranges another opportunity ... then spurns it, and Azarenka punishes her, upping the aggression to clinch the set principally via forehand. Azarenka 7-5 Pavlyuchenkova And there it is: Paylyuchenkova spurns various game points then tamely nets a backhand, giving Azarenka a third break of the set. She’ll serve for it in 90 while, on Lenglen, Vondrousova and Badosa are out for what should be a decent tear-up. Great news. I absolutely love Halep, and can’t wait to see her play again – we’ve missed her here. Azarenka holds easily for 5-5, and I’d not be surprised to see her break in the next game. Pavlyuchenkova started this match playing pretty much as well as she can and will be perturbed to have nothing to show for it. Still, though Azarenka has improved since then, she’ll now serve to stay in the set. Azarenka 4-5 Pavlyuchenkova Wikipedia informs me that Badosa’s favorite shot is the serve. Lovely stuff. On Chatrier, they’ve swapped breaks again; Azarenka is serving at 3-4 down. Next on Lenglen, it’s that match I mentioned below; will power and aggression of Badosa be too much for the canny, skilful Vondrousova? That’s a brilliant win and performance from Zidansek, who reaches her first Grand Slam quarter. She hung tough when she need to, then opened her shoulders at the key moments; if she keeps it up, she’ll have plenty for whichever of Vondrousova [20] or Badosa [33] she meets next. Zidansek goes wide with a forehand down the line, handing Cirstea a point to claw back one of her two breaks; again, she finds a really good serve that allows her to make deuce, and seconds later she has her first match point.... Azarenka breaks back and is starting to hum; behold Pavlyuchenkova’s behind-ear tatt. On Lenglen, Cirstea has struggled through a hold, forcing Zidansek to serve for it at 5-1. Pavlyuchenkova now leads Azarenka by a break, 3-1, while Zidansek powers through a hold that includes her first ace of a match that doesn’t have long left. At 0-5, Cirstea will now serve to stay in the competition. Zidansek has hit a vein at precisely the right time, and from 40-15 she works a point for a double break, thanks in part to a double on deuce; she takes it, and suddenly this match is nearly over. Zidansek 7-6(5) 4-0 Cirstea On Chatrier, Azarenka and Pavlyuchenkova have swapped breaks in their first two games while back on Lenglen, Zidansek does indeed get her break; she arranges three opportunities and takes the second, a lovely backhand down the line sealing the deal. Cirstea is in trouble. Zidansek 7-6(5) 2-0 Cirstea A loopy forehand drops long and suddenly, from 30-0, Zidansek is 30-40 – a terrific serve out wide quickly draws her level again, but Cirstea unloads some vicious forehands to earn a second break point; Zidansek saves it and then another before closing out. She’s played the big points well and that’s why she’s in front; I’d not be surprised to see her break in the next game. Zidansek 7-6(5) 1-0 Cirstea Again it’s Zidansek with the mini-break and at 3-5, Cirstea doesn’t have long to resolve it ... and she has even less time now, racing to the net, but when the ball’s banged at her she can only deflect it wide. Three set points it is, and though Cirstea saves the first with yet another winner, she then sends a forehand wide. That’s a tough set to lose because she was the better player; other hand, she’ll feel confident she’s got the game to win form here. Zidansek 7-6(5) Cirstea Cirstea seems to be hitting it a bit harder than Zidansek, on a regular and on special occasions, a barrage of blows – the last of them a sensational forehand cross-court on the run – putting her in front. Before the match I fancied Zidansek, but that power differential is significant – for as long as Cirstea’s radar is operational. And there we go – she bangs a forehand down the line but catches the ball a little late, wiping it just wide. But she retrieves the mini-break immediately with some lovely hands and balance at the net. Zidansek 6(3)-(3)6 Cirstea Cirstea gets 0-15 and will be vexed that she then nets a forehand return that drops into the slot. But she makes Zidansek play a low backhand right on the baseline that falls long, and the aroma of opportunity will be wafting through her nostrils. Zidansek, though, is having no such thing, her lateral movement on-point and facilitating a forehand winner punished down the line for 40-30. She can’t close out though, and Cirstea saves a succession of game-points on advantage before another backhand winner - there’ve been a few – raises her first set-point. Zidansek, though, delivers a gorgeous, nerveless forehand winner down the line – then another – and this is developing into a really good tussle. A big service winner down the middle, and we’ve got that breaker. Zidansek 6-6 Cirstea Excellent from Zidansek, rattling through an easy hold, but then Cirstea does likewise and we might be just moving to that elusive point of both players playing well at the same time; if Zidansek can muster one more hold, we’ll get to examine that premise in a breaker. Zidansek 5-6 Cirstea Cirstea holds to 30 – Zidansek is getting closer – but in 90 seconds she’ll serve under pressure, and who knows how that’ll pan out? Zidansek 4-5 Cirstea Looking down the rest of the day’s play, Tsitsipas v Carreno Busta stands out – as does any match featuring the Greek musketeer – but Azarenka v Pavlyuchenvoka and Serena v Rybakina could also be good. Zidansek and Cirstea are at different stages of their careers, the former 23 and the latter 31. But they’re a really good match for each other based on what we’ve seen so far, with Cirstea looking to have settled faster – she’s hitting beautifully from the back and showing decent enterprise at the net. Zidansek 3-4 Cirstea Chatrier Azarenka [15] v Pavlyuchenkova [31] Tsitsipas [5] v Carreno Busta [12] Williams S v Rybakina [21] Zverev [6] v Nishikori (night match) ** Lenglen Zidansek v Cirstea Vondrousova [20] v Badosa Garin [22] v Medvedev [2] Davidovich Fokina v Delbonnis Tamara Zidansek and Sorana Cirstea – both unseeded – swapped breaks in the first two games of their fourth-round match before Cirstea held. I’ve seen a fair of both over the last week, and really like how both have played, Zidansek especially – she’s dismissed Bianca Andreescu, the number six seed, and Katerina Siniakova, while Cirstea has ejected Johanna Konta and Daria Kasatkina. In other words, this should be good, and in the time I sopent writing the above, Zidansek held convincingly. Zidansek 2-2 Cirstea Morning all!

Today, all things being equal, England will draw their third consecutive Test at home for the first time since the late eighties. And though that’s mainly down to the weather, it also reflects a different approach and a greater resilience under Chris Silverwood. The Bayliss-era England might have thrown the towel in when they slipped to 140 for six; instead, Rory Burns and Ollie Robinson (with bat and ball) stalled New Zealand’s momentum to such an extent that they finished the day crawling along at two an over.</p> <p>New Zealand will resume on 62 for two, a lead of 165. With a maximum of 98 overs to bowl, they could still force victory on a pitch is becoming more uneven. But with a forecast for showers – of the meteorological rather than the middle-order kind – that looks unlikely. Madame de Stael said that one must choose in life between boredom and suffering.

Five more overs at run a ball would allow them to set a target of 306 in 68 overs, which should give them immunity against defeat. Play will resume at 1.26pm, it says here. 52.3 overs: New Zealand 169-6 (Watling 15, de Grandhomme 9) de Grandhomme pulls Anderson up and over for four. With New Zealand in one-day mode, I’m surprised England aren’t using their only white-ball bowler, Mark Wood. Not that it matters for now because the rain is getting heavier and the umpires have decided to take an early lunch. New Zealand have a handy lead of 272, and there are a maximum of 75.3 overs remaining (minus two for the change of innings). They could still win this. 52nd over: New Zealand 162-6 (Watling 15, de Grandhomme 2) The new batter Colin de Grandhomme gets off a pair by whapping a full toss for a single. New Zealand lead by 265. “Good morning Rob,” says Adam Roberts. “Your mention of Stuart B on Courtney Walsh’s knee immediately put me in mind of one of my favourite photos. My very young daughter, all golden curls and cherubic features, sitting on Michael Holding’s knee - completely oblivious to who he is - attacking him with a giant foam finger. “Which ties in nicely with today. Unexpectedly awake from 4am. I made the most of it by switching on the cricket at 5. First up is the mellifluous voice of Mikey H, explaining his late arrival at the Test because of the problems of getting out of Cayman to the UK (he had to fly through the States) - something my family is currently struggling with.” Henry Nicholls walks. He missed a reverse sweep at Root and gloved the ball into the off side, where Burns ran forward from slip and swooped to take a fine low catch. 51st over: New Zealand 159-5 (Nicholls 23, Watling 14) Some light rain is falling at Lord’s. Play continues for now, though the umpires could decide to take an early lunch. “Is it just me,” says Mark Steward, “or does Ollie Robinson look like the secret lovechild of Freddie Flintoff and Steve Harmison?” He reminds me more of Harmison when he bats, though he’s obviously more accomplished. I suppose there are many worse lovechildren to resemble. 50th over: New Zealand 157-5 (Nicholls 22, Watling 13) Root hurries through another over, and why not. 49th over: New Zealand 156-5 (Nicholls 22, Watling 12) Watling edges Anderson for four, which takes New Zealand’s lead to 259. There are still a maximum of 79 overs remaining; I’d imagine they will given England a target of around 310 in 67 overs. 48th over: New Zealand 151-5 (Nicholls 22, Watling 7) Root continues. Nicholls swipes him over mid-on for four and then misses a huge slog-sweep. Had he connected with that, no outdoor brunch on St John’s Wood High Street would have been safe. New Zealand lead by 254, and I’m starting to wonder whether England are sleepwalking into a horror movie. 47th over: New Zealand 144-5 (Nicholls 16, Watling 6) Or maybe Root came on so that Anderson can change ends, which is what he has just done. One from the over. “Finding the endless moaning about over rates on telly and radio increasingly irritating,” says Andy Moore. “Why can’t we just accept that in the modern game bowling 15 overs per hour isn’t feasible (what with reviews, drinks breaks etc)? Is there any other sport that places more importance in the time of day than the amount of play to be completed? Looking forward to the Ryder Cup concluding at 6pm sharp with America 1/2 point ahead and Justin Rose 4 up with 5 to play. Really grinds my gears.” I can see both sides of this argument. I find it hard to angry about slow over-rates, but then I haven’t paid however much to get into the ground. Your point is a good one, that there are more natural interruptions nowadays, concussion checks and the like, but equally 12 overs an hour is pushing it. Maybe 14 per hour is a more realistic target, I don’t know. 46th over: New Zealand 142-5 (Nicholls 15, Watling 5) Joe Root replaces Anderson, perhaps with England’s inadequate over-rate in mind. Five from the over. “In cryptic crossword circles, the process which you just have described about de Stael (ie divining the existence of something highbrow from something distinctly lowbrow) is known as ‘Ninja Turtling’,” says Tom Adam. “It stems from, ‘Of course I’ve heard of Donatello. He’s the one with the purple mask.’” That’s a good phrase, I hadn’t heard of that. Also, David Chase would like to discuss your description of the Sopranos as ‘distinctly lowbrow’. It’s okay, he’s in a good mood. 45th over: New Zealand 137-5 (Nicholls 11, Watling 4) I thought they might promote Colin de Grandhomme for some bish-bosh, but BJ Watling is the new batter, and he gets going with an emphatic cut for four. That was a useful cameo from Taylor: 33 from 35 balls with one four, two sixes and a comprehensive range of fresh-air shots. “Kudos to Michael Keane for not venting spleen on anyone else (the pandemic aside) for his mis-ticketing episode,” says Ian Copestake. “I wish him a very tasty lunch.” I hope it’s not egg and bacon. Ross Taylor’s eccentric innings comes to an end. He chases a deliberately wide delivery from Wood and snicks it through to Bracey, who takes a nice low catch to his right. 44th over: New Zealand 132-4 (Taylor 33, Nicholls 10) Jimmy Anderson comes on for Stuart Broad, and Taylor survives a very good-looking LBW shout. The umpire Michael Gough thought there was an inside edge, but the two noises were actually the ball hitting both pads. England have wasted all three of their reviews; had they been able to go upstairs, Taylor would have been out. “Just re-emerging from your Cricinfo link/wormhole in the 34th over,” says Jim Crane. “That 1989 Australia tour itinerary - madon! Six Tests, visits to all the counties, and then casually rounding it off with two bilateral series against Netherlands and Denmark! Imagine rocking up to an ICC board meeting in 2021 with that proposal.” It’s great isn’t it. They played a county game the day after they regained the Ashes, and the stand-in captain Geoff Marsh chose to bat first on a green mamba because, in his words, “the boys are all still pissed”. 43rd over: New Zealand 126-4 (Taylor 30, Nicholls 7) An extraordinary shot from Ross Taylor, who slogs across the line at Wood and top edges the ball high over third man for six. Taylor is so dangerous that, despite middling almost nothing, he has raced to 30 from 31 balls. “Morning Rob,” says Michael Keane. “I’m heading home from Lord’s where, on arrival at the Grace Gate, it transpired that my ticket was for yesterday. Woe is me. As a newly minted member I had thought my days of ticket tragedies were over. But for now even those of us bedecked in egg and bacon need to book a seat. Bloody global pandemic... Looks like it’s the OBO and TMS for me today then. Maybe I’ll make lunch for my better half or something. Feck.” This is mildly heartbreaking, and extremely funny. (I say that as the kind of airhead who does things like this all the time.) 42nd over: New Zealand 118-4 (Taylor 23, Nicholls 6) Nicholls goes into one-day mode, walking down the pitch to slice Broad high over the slips for four. Broad replies with another big inswinger - too big, this time, as it veers away for four leg byes. New Zealand have scored 56 from 12 overs this morning; they lead by 221. “If Friedrich Nietzsche was on comms,” says Ian Copestake, his eyebrows unintentionally betraying the extent of that if, “Zak Crawley’s cover drive would be a cue for his line that, ‘Art is the supreme task and the truly metaphysical activity in this life.’” 41st over: New Zealand 109-4 (Taylor 23, Nicholls 1) Mark Wood replaces Ollie Robinson (14-5-26-3) and beats Taylor with the first and last deliveries of the over. Two runs from it. “The 2000 Code of the Laws of Cricket was the first to use ‘fielder’, instead of ‘fieldsman’,” says Alan Tuffery. That’s interesting; I expected it to be much earlier than that. 40th over: New Zealand 107-4 (Taylor 22, Nicholls 1) That’s Broad’s 518th Test wicket, which puts him one behind Courtney Walsh, the man whose lap Broad used to sit on when he was a kid. Imagine the eight-year-old Broad’s face if you told him they would both end up with 500 Test wickets. After a mildly scandalous amount of misfortune, Stuart Broad finally gets his first wicket of the match in his 38th over. Latham, beaten the ball before, is hit on the back leg by a big inswinger bowled from wider on the crease. Michael Gough gives it out and, though Latham reviews, it’s hitting enough of leg stump for the original decision to stand. 39th over: New Zealand 106-3 (Latham 36, Taylor 22) Taylor misses another disgusting mow across the line at Robinson. But then he finally nails the shot, pinging Robinson over midwicket for a huge six. He is always dangerous, even when his bat seems to have no middle. “Hi Rob,” says Pete Salmon. “Who remembers The Professionals? We’ve been watching Bodie and Doyle at ours as our lockdown treat – just started the final series and already mourning getting to the end. Two very nice moments for OBOers recently. One, Bodie playing club cricket, moving rapidly through the nineties with a series of pull shots, and then getting bowled for 97 after being distracted by a call to duty (followed by getting changed out of his whites in the back of a speeding car, as we’ve all done at some stage). And then in last night’s episode, Doyle having to pretend he’s an intellectual. Bodie: ‘Can you keep the patter up?’ Doyle: ‘Of course, I read the Guardian.’” I’m now desperate to know what Arthur Daley made of our esteemed rag. 38th over: New Zealand 97-3 (Latham 35, Taylor 14) “Excellent Guardianista preamble reference to the French-Swiss Anne Louise Germaine de Staël-Holstein,” says Brian Withington. “She almost invented the Guardian strap line with the phrase ‘Search for the truth is the noblest occupation of man; its publication is a duty’. Apparently she is also quoted as saying, ‘The more I see of man, the more I like dogs’, so something for [redacted] readers, too.” While I’d love to flaunt my education, and perhaps explore what Nietzsche’s philosophy can tell us about Zak Crawley’s cover drive, I only know the Madade de Staël quote because Meadow mentions it in the Sopranos. 37th over: New Zealand 93-3 (Latham 34, Taylor 11) Taylor doesn’t look remotely comfortable against Robinson. He is beaten outside off stump, edges short of the slips and then hacks desperately across the line for a couple of runs. Robinson smiles at Taylor with contempt and then has a big LBW appeal turned down when Taylor misses another smear. England was their last review - it hit him miles outside off stump. That wasn’t great captaincy from Joe Root. But it was a brilliant over from Robinson, which concludes with another play and miss by Taylor 36th over: New Zealand 91-3 (Latham 34, Taylor 8) “The last day of the match will not be so drab if Ross Taylor and Colin de Grandhomme can come in and smash Anderson and co. to make a hundred-odd runs in 90 minutes,” writes Gangesh. “Chasing 300-plus in 70 overs will enthuse England, and their aggression could provide the Kiwi bowlers opportunities. So that’s a possibility Kane Williamson can explore to inject some interest in the game - provided, of course, the notorious English weather stays fine!” A repeat of the last day in 2015 would be all kinds of fun. 35th over: New Zealand 87-3 (Latham 33, Taylor 6) England would love to get Taylor early as he is somebody who can score quickly, as he shows with a cracking extra cover drive for four later. Robinson pulls his length back as a result and rips one past the edge. Lovely response. “Has anyone seen a split screen of Ollie Robinson and Josh Hazlewood bowling?” says Gary Naylor. “The more I see of the Sussex bruiser, the more I think of the Australian err... bruiser.” Hazlewood’s a bit quicker, isn’t he? But otherwise it’s an excellent comparison – forensic accuracy, sharp bounce, seam movement and a hint of malevolence. 34th over: New Zealand 81-3 (Latham 32, Taylor 1) There’s an urgency to New Zealand’s batting that wasn’t evident last night, so perhaps my assumption of a draw was premature. I can think of one precedent in particular. But it’s really not easy to score quickly on this pitch. Broad beats Latham with a stunning delivery and then has him dropped by Crawley at midwicket, a sharp two-handed chance to his right. Broad has had no luck at all in this game. “I can live with batter,” says Adrian Goldman. “What I can’t live with is that in science, sulfate is now the expected spelling, not sulphate. Beyond dismay: pretty much the end of civilisation as we know it.” I’ll see your sulfate and raise you T20 scorecards that have dot balls instead of maidens. It’s cultural vandalism. What the hell is 2-4-12-1 supposed to mean? 33rd over: New Zealand 80-3 (Latham 32, Taylor 0) In the history of Test cricket there have been 3,054 debuts, but none quite look Ollie Robinson’s: 42 runs, seven cheap wickets and a public shaming. He loses his line at the end of the over, spearing a delivery down the leg side for four byes. James Bracey was pretty gutted that it wasn’t called a wide. A third wicket for Ollie Robinson. Wagner, roughed up by a couple of good short balls, top-edged a hook miles in the air and was calmly caught by James Bracey. 32nd over: New Zealand 72-2 (Latham 31, Wagner 10) Stuart Broad gets a chance to bowl at Neil Wagner, who dismissed him yesterday and celebrated with a red-faced flourish. Broad appeals for LBW first ball, but it was going down on the angle. Wagner then cracks two boundaries, a flash up and over the cordon and a majestic flick through midwicket. I’d love to hear Broad’s internal monologue right now. “This fuss comes up regularly,” says John Starbuck. “’Batter’ is, agreed, both an Americanism (by way of the English invention of baseball) and a flour, milk and egg mixture. But think what might happen if we used ‘bowlsman’ as a standard. If we can do it with one essential element of cricket, we can do it with the other. Besides, look at the ambiguities of ‘pitch’ and ‘wicket’, which vary a lot depending on context. Language is meant to be fluid.” Test Match Special overseas link Here you are. 31st over: New Zealand 62-2 (Latham 30, Wagner 2) Ollie Robinson will open the bowling, a reward for his forensic excellence last night. He switches over and round the wicket to Latham, giving him precisely no opportunities to score. Thus, it’s a maiden. “The OED has instances ‘batter’ being used in relation to cricket going back about 200 years, so it’s not like it’s without precedent,” says Andrew Cosgrove. “Also, you don’t talk about a ‘bowlsman’ do you? Anyway, do you think England are capable of batting out two sessions for a draw?” I do, I do. A collapse wouldn’t shock me but I think it’s unlikely, especially as there are likely to be one of two rain interruptions. This is a majestic piece from Andy Bull, with a particularly brilliant intro. “I am becoming more &amp; more dismayed by the use of the term ‘batter’ in cricket,” says Ben Carter. “All the commentators are doing it. The term is BATSMAN. Are you all coordinated by someone who tells you what to say?” Yes, last month Mother Cricket gave her 475 children a collective brollocking for our sexist terminology. Seriously, though, with everything else that’s going on in the world right now, is a change of language designed to increase inclusivity really worthy of dismay? I can understand thinking it’s a bit heavy-handed, not that I’d necessarily agree, but dismay, I can’t have that. The draws are back in town. Today, all things being equal, England will draw their third consecutive Test at home for the first time since the late eighties. And though that’s mainly down to the weather, it also reflects a different approach and a greater resilience under Chris Silverwood. The Bayliss-era England might have thrown the towel in when they slipped to 140 for six; instead, Rory Burns and Ollie Robinson (with bat and ball) stalled New Zealand’s momentum to such an extent that they finished the day crawling along at two an over. New Zealand will resume on 62 for two, a lead of 165. With a maximum of 98 overs to bowl, they could still force victory on a pitch is becoming more uneven. But with a forecast for showers – of the meteorological rather than the middle-order kind – that looks unlikely. Madame de Stael said that one must choose in life between boredom and suffering. England politely request a boring last day.","charCount":"16586","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/robsmyth\">Rob Smyth</a> (now) and <a href=\"profile/timdelisle\">Tim de Lisle</a> (later)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"stage/2021/jun/06/violetta-elvin-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-06T12:14:08Z","webTitle":"Violetta Elvin obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/jun/06/violetta-elvin-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2021/jun/06/violetta-elvin-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Violetta Elvin obituary","standfirst":"Influential Russian-born ballet dancer who joined the Sadler’s Wells company in London just after the second world war","trailText":"Influential Russian-born ballet dancer who joined the Sadler’s Wells company in London just after the second world war","byline":"Judith Cruickshank","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d1ceadeb3432e5558b81bd00885d85fa43ba63aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1ceadeb3432e5558b81bd00885d85fa43ba63aa/0_386_2755_1653/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Violetta Elvin and John Field dancing in Swan Lake, 1953.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Violetta Elvin and John Field dancing in Swan Lake, 1953.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Baron/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>In 1945, when Violetta Elvin joined the Sadler’s Wells Ballet in London, she opened a new window for the dancers of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/mar/09/guardianobituaries1\" title=\"\">Ninette de Valois</a>’s company.

I just have to keep scoring runs.</p> <p>“Since I got dropped in the middle of 2018, I’ve gone away and done what I was told, which is score runs. Hopefully, if I keep getting big scores like this, I can put pressure on the people who make decisions.</p> <p>“I think I played well in that Ashes series (2017/18). That was as well as I could have played at the time.<br></p> <p>“I feel I now know my game better. Being back in the T20s and the odd ODI, I’ve learnt what I need to do to perform at that level. That’s really important.</p> <p>“You’re playing against bowlers you play against all the time, but Test cricket is a different mentality and there’s more scrutiny.

However, his eighth delivered the goods – a high tempo 72-ball knock navigating reverse swing from seamers including Saqib Mahmood.</p> <p>Labuschagne has been a shadow of the player who dominated county attacks in early 2019, yet here navigated a pitch Lancashire’s Alex Davies described as “substandard” at the close on Friday. He also posted 44 in the first innings.</p> <p>The Queenslander said: “It was nice to be out there for the winning runs. To do it the fourth innings when the ball has gone reverse, which is exciting to play against because it is something we don’t get much of in Australia in domestic cricket, was very satisfying.”</p> <p>Glamorgan’s second win came as they advanced from 137 for three overnight, chasing the fixture’s highest score. However, they still have an uphill task to claim a top two finish in Group Three ahead of Lancashire, Yorkshire and the other contenders, Northamptonshire.</p> <p><strong>Lancashire</strong>, the leaders, had hoped to take a significant step towards the top group, but they may be only four points clear of Yorkshire at the end of this round with two still to play and Scarborough to visit next month.</p> <p>Dawid Malan showed his rounded class with a serene 199 for <strong>Yorkshire</strong> as they seek victory over <strong>Sussex </strong>at Headingley. They claimed a first-innings lead of 245 midway through the evening before Sussex closed on a sturdy 38 without loss.</p> <p>In his first four-day appearance since last August, when he scored 219 in a Bob Willis Trophy draw against Derbyshire here, the left‑hander punished an inexperienced attack to move from 103 overnight before being bowled by off-spinner Jack Carson after lunch for the second 199 of his career.</p> <p>Malan, who played the last of his 15 Tests in August 2018, missed out on becoming the first Yorkshire player to score double hundreds in two consecutive innings.</p> <p><strong>Warwickshire</strong> went top of Group One with a 191-run win at <strong>Derbyshire</strong>, who were bowled out for 121 in their second innings. Oliver Hannon-Dalby took four for 24 to secure a fourth win.</p> <p><strong>Gloucestershire</strong>’s strong position at the Group Two summit has been eroded with back-to-back defeats, this latest against <strong>Leicestershire </strong>at Grace Road. The home side won by an innings and 93 as the left-arm spinner Callum Parkinson returned career-best match figures of 10 for 108.</p> <p><strong>Somerset</strong> will hope to leapfrog Gloucester with a home win over <strong>Hampshire</strong>.

Back in 40 minutes to see if Somerset and Yorkshire can whistle up a win, Essex can find the magic formula at Chelmsford and Kent and Northants can contrive something out of nothing. Chelmsford: Essex 210 v Nottinghamshire 293 and 23-1 Taunton: Somerset 360 and 409-7 v Hampshire 311 and 30-1 Canterbury: Kent 330-5dec v Northants 393 and 70-4 Headingley: Yorkshire 558 v Sussex 313 and 105-2 And at 12.58, Steve Patterson persuades the umpires to change the ball and they swap it for another, 53 overs new. Does anyone know how it works - the umpires can’t possibly have a ball for every eventuality. They can’t have 79 balls in their store-cupboard? Northants, Northants! Currently 60-4, with two for Stevens, one for Gilchrist and one for Cummins. A lead of just 123 over Kent, but Saif Zaib, who has had a smashing little season, at the crease. I didn’t realise prawn cocktail was back in vogue! My mum’s go-to starter for a 1980s dinner party. The rain forces an early lunch at Lord’s. The clouds remain high above Headingley and Sussex reach their hundred, with just two wickets lost this morning. Sussex will be quietly pleased with their morning’s work, with ten minutes till lunch. A breakthrough at Chelmsford! It be Peter Siddle, with Compton gone for 8. And an email whisks through the air from Romeo: “Hampshire need 459 to win. I wonder what the highest chase total set has been in CC history?” A quick google seems to suggest that the record remains with Middlesex, who chased 472 to beat Yorkshire by seven wickets in May 2014, with Chris Rogers unbeaten on 241. At last! Bartlett gets his hundred, Somerset pass 400 and Hampshire have a challenge. Hampshire need 459 to win. Here, 20 year old Ali Orr nestles to his fifty! With a pull down to fine leg , another Sussex half century on debut Paul Edwards tells me that since August 1 last year, Sussex have given first-class debuts to nine players in 13 games. To compare, in the BWT, Lancashire gave first-class debuts to six players. Siddle and Sam Cook with the new ball at Chelmsford; Compton and Slater just have to bat it out for some plump points for a draw. Michael Duggan asks the question: “Really don’t understand why Somerset haven’t declared – over 400 ahead on the final day. Any thoughts? Might be waiting for Bartlett to get 100 but seems very strange to jeopardise your chance of winning the match.” We were just mulling that over in the Headingley press box. Equally puzzled. They must really rate the Hampshire batting line-up, I guess. Some great livestream stats for the RHF trophy. Add the 589,000 youtube and facebook views for the Roses match last week, and a lot of people are watching a lot of cricket. Now then. So Essex are all out for 210, trailing Notts by 293. If this was last year, you’d put money on Harmer to bowl Notts out for under 100. But in 2021, the Notts-up has become something of an endangered species, and Harmer has lost his cloak of invincibility. And another! With the third ball of his morning spell, Van Zyl feathers Thompson through to Duke and has to trudge, eyes firmly on the grass back to the dressing-room. A golden duck. Sussex 60-2. A top edge! A bit of extra bounce from Bess and Tom Haines sends the ball up and into the paws of Adam Lyth. The end of a partnership of 60 between the openers, Sussex 60-1. A wicket at Chelmsford! Shane Snater is lbw to Brett Hutton for his 200th first-class wicket. Essex 195-9. Sussex pottering along much untroubled here at Headingley, which will please Lancashire no end. Ben Stokes will make his boom-back at Chester-le-Street on Friday in the T20 game against Yorkshire. Did Darren Stevens read the memo? Darren Stevens doing Darren Stevens things, pincering Emilio Gay lbw for 8, Northants 14-1. Adam Lyth gets just the one over before Dom Bess is thrown the ball. A real opportunity for the scruffy scamp today, though on a pitch that didn’t much spin yesterday. Jack Carlson, who has just been given a contract extension by Sussex, did manage to extract some turn and bounce with the wickets of Malan and Ballance. What is this sorcery? Kent have declared on their overnight 330-5: which gives Northamptonshire a second innings lead of 62 runs. Some old-fashioned declaration bowling hangs in the air. Adam Lyth bowls the first ball of the day, from the Emerald Stand end. A Sunday sprinkling of spectators, Orr and Haines the men charged with steadfast blocking. Dawid Malan , who I’m reliably informed played a perfectly-judged innings yesterday, driving particularly well before being out for 199, spoke engagingly last night: “ I’ve tried to learn from my failures at Test cricket and put that into practice in four-day cricket. “Since 2019, I think my record speaks for itself in just having that fearless approach in four-day cricket and backing my technique and way of playing. Possible Test return? “I wouldn’t be here playing four-day cricket if I didn’t want to play Test cricket again. I still feel like I’ve got a hell of a lot to give. Whether I’m good enough, that’s not my decision. I just have to keep scoring runs. “Since I got dropped in the middle of 2018, I’ve gone away and done what I was told, which is score runs. Hopefully, if I keep getting big scores like this, I can put pressure on the people who make decisions. “I think I played well in that Ashes series (2017/18). That was as well as I could have played at the time. “I feel I now know my game better. Being back in the T20s and the odd ODI, I’ve learnt what I need to do to perform at that level. That’s really important. “You’re playing against bowlers you play against all the time, but Test cricket is a different mentality and there’s more scrutiny. In my last five Tests, I probably didn’t handle that as well as I could have. Hopefully I’d be in a better position now.” Chelmsford: Essex 180-7 v Nottinghamshire 293 Taunton: Somerset 360 and 323-6 v Hampshire 311 Canterbury: Kent 330-5 v Northants 393 Headingley: Yorkshire 558 v Sussex 313 and 38-0 Marnus Labuschagne’s highest score of a difficult summer, an unbeaten 63, ended county cricket’s only remaining unbeaten record as Glamorgan chased 188 to beat Lancashire by six wickets at Sophia Gardens shortly before 12.30pm on day three. The much-vaunted Australian had not previously posted a fifty in seven Championship innings in 2021. However, his eighth delivered the goods – a high tempo 72-ball knock navigating reverse swing from seamers including Saqib Mahmood. Labuschagne has been a shadow of the player who dominated county attacks in early 2019, yet here navigated a pitch Lancashire’s Alex Davies described as “substandard” at the close on Friday. He also posted 44 in the first innings. The Queenslander said: “It was nice to be out there for the winning runs. To do it the fourth innings when the ball has gone reverse, which is exciting to play against because it is something we don’t get much of in Australia in domestic cricket, was very satisfying.” Glamorgan’s second win came as they advanced from 137 for three overnight, chasing the fixture’s highest score. However, they still have an uphill task to claim a top two finish in Group Three ahead of Lancashire, Yorkshire and the other contenders, Northamptonshire. Lancashire, the leaders, had hoped to take a significant step towards the top group, but they may be only four points clear of Yorkshire at the end of this round with two still to play and Scarborough to visit next month. Dawid Malan showed his rounded class with a serene 199 for Yorkshire as they seek victory over Sussex at Headingley. They claimed a first-innings lead of 245 midway through the evening before Sussex closed on a sturdy 38 without loss. In his first four-day appearance since last August, when he scored 219 in a Bob Willis Trophy draw against Derbyshire here, the left‑hander punished an inexperienced attack to move from 103 overnight before being bowled by off-spinner Jack Carson after lunch for the second 199 of his career. Malan, who played the last of his 15 Tests in August 2018, missed out on becoming the first Yorkshire player to score double hundreds in two consecutive innings. Warwickshire went top of Group One with a 191-run win at Derbyshire, who were bowled out for 121 in their second innings. Oliver Hannon-Dalby took four for 24 to secure a fourth win. Gloucestershire’s strong position at the Group Two summit has been eroded with back-to-back defeats, this latest against Leicestershire at Grace Road. The home side won by an innings and 93 as the left-arm spinner Callum Parkinson returned career-best match figures of 10 for 108. Somerset will hope to leapfrog Gloucester with a home win over Hampshire. Half-centuries in the second innings for Steve Davies, Tom Abell and George Bartlett secured a lead of 372 and counting. Essex and Nottinghamshire, two contenders at the top of Group One, look likely to play out a draw at Chelmsford, while Durham are far from out of the equation having won at Worcestershire chasing 86. Kent, for whom Ollie Robinson scored 120, are playing out a rainy high-scoring game with Northamptonshire at Canterbury in Group Three. That is on course for a draw assuming there is no final day contrivance. Hello! It’s a sweet June morning at Headingley, though the gateman warned that there is rain in Wakefield and it is a-heading this way.

Nero did nothing, or he played the violin (so I was taught as a child), while the city went up in flames. Blaming Christians for the fire, he had them burned alive in pits, before building a giant golden palace on the ruins. He also murdered his mother, brother, two of his wives and much of the Roman elite.</p> <p>The only surviving accounts of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/nero.shtml\">Nero</a> (37-68 AD) – by Tacitus and Suetonius, near-contemporary historians, and Cassius Dio in the second century – are almost unanimously hostile. A teenager put on the throne by his scheming mother, <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Julia-Agrippina\">Agrippina</a>, Nero is greedy, violent and homicidal. In addition to fratricide, matricide and uxoricide, he is even guilty of the unusual crime of “urbicide”, having set fire to Rome himself.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.britishmuseum.org/exhibitions/nero-man-behind-myth?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI6d7u75P08AIVTwGLCh3UUQBfEAAYASAAEgLnufD_BwE\">British Museum’s stupendous new blockbuster</a> buttonholes you at the door with the proposition that you see the show and then decide between Nero as unfairly maligned or “egomaniacal, excessive and evil”. It takes a certain effort of will not to see everything that follows as evidence. Does this coin of Nero and Agrippina’s <a href=\"https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/C_1964-1203-89\">overlapping heads</a> show him as a weak-willed mummy’s boy? Does this ivory figure of a <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Statuette_actor_Petit_Palais_ADUT00192.jpg\">tragic actor</a>, accompanied by the news that Nero played the mother-killing Oedipus on stage before the public – only think of the irony! – prove he was the narcissist of Tacitus’s telling?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The staging is superbly eventful, so that you move from pomp and circumstance straight into horrific reality</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A Roman window grating lies at foot-level before you, warped nearly out of recognition by the flames that devastated the city in AD64. The sight is a shock, particularly since it comes from the very place where the fire started, by the Circus Maximus. But it cannot tell you who – if anybody, as opposed to an accidental spark – committed the arson.</p> <p>The show starts with a coup de theatre: a long, black corridor suddenly rounds a corner to take you face to face with Nero himself, his sightless marble eyes spotlit in the darkness. This magnificent loan, from the <a href=\"http://www.museicapitolini.org/en/percorsi/percorsi_per_sale/palazzo_nuovo/sala_degli_imperatori/ritratto_di_nerone\">Capitoline Museum</a> in Rome, is probably the most famous portrait of Nero in existence. The wide, square head, thick neck and cumbersome chin, the facetious curl of the fleshy lips: he appears immediately thuggish. Though surely there’s no art to find the mind’s construction in the face.</p> <p>The likeness is both a revelation and – supposedly – a fraud. We are told that only the upper head is ancient, the rest a 1660s restoration “based on hostile accounts”. Whereupon the British Museum presents a colour photograph of a modern recreation, in which Nero is a pocked redhead with a hideous neck beard; many removes, now, from any kind of truth.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e2bd2edefdc4bde9c72a501f5665bafc207b5430\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2bd2edefdc4bde9c72a501f5665bafc207b5430/0_177_3268_4080/801.jpg\" alt=\"Bronze gladiator’s helmet, Pompeii, 1st century AD.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bronze gladiator’s helmet, Pompeii, 1st century AD.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Trustees of The British Museum</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet vigilant visitors will notice lineaments of the very same physiognomy throughout the exhibition, in coins, reliefs, bronze and marble heads. The rudiments are even there in a statue of Nero as a boy, arms lifted angelically. The Capitoline bust can hardly be so scathing if it agrees with Nero’s own triumphalist propaganda.</p> <p>The show sustains its theatre from first to last. The imperial family tree spelled out in a parade of <a href=\"https://www.bradenton.com/entertainment/article251643378.html\">lifesize statues</a>, ghostly in the gloom. Nero with a lyre (it was never a fiddle). Ceiling fragments from his golden palace, painted with gods and sphinxes. Exquisite silver horse trappings that once belonged to Pliny the Elder.</p> <p>The staging is superbly eventful, so that you move from pomp and circumstance straight into horrific reality – a colossal chain, looping heavily between neck rings, worn by slaves labouring for the Romans in Wales.

Nero did nothing, or he played the violin (so I was taught as a child), while the city went up in flames. Blaming Christians for the fire, he had them burned alive in pits, before building a giant golden palace on the ruins. He also murdered his mother, brother, two of his wives and much of the Roman elite. The only surviving accounts of Nero (37-68 AD) – by Tacitus and Suetonius, near-contemporary historians, and Cassius Dio in the second century – are almost unanimously hostile. A teenager put on the throne by his scheming mother, Agrippina, Nero is greedy, violent and homicidal. In addition to fratricide, matricide and uxoricide, he is even guilty of the unusual crime of “urbicide”, having set fire to Rome himself. The British Museum’s stupendous new blockbuster buttonholes you at the door with the proposition that you see the show and then decide between Nero as unfairly maligned or “egomaniacal, excessive and evil”. It takes a certain effort of will not to see everything that follows as evidence. Does this coin of Nero and Agrippina’s overlapping heads show him as a weak-willed mummy’s boy? Does this ivory figure of a tragic actor, accompanied by the news that Nero played the mother-killing Oedipus on stage before the public – only think of the irony! – prove he was the narcissist of Tacitus’s telling? A Roman window grating lies at foot-level before you, warped nearly out of recognition by the flames that devastated the city in AD64. The sight is a shock, particularly since it comes from the very place where the fire started, by the Circus Maximus. But it cannot tell you who – if anybody, as opposed to an accidental spark – committed the arson. The show starts with a coup de theatre: a long, black corridor suddenly rounds a corner to take you face to face with Nero himself, his sightless marble eyes spotlit in the darkness. This magnificent loan, from the Capitoline Museum in Rome, is probably the most famous portrait of Nero in existence. The wide, square head, thick neck and cumbersome chin, the facetious curl of the fleshy lips: he appears immediately thuggish. Though surely there’s no art to find the mind’s construction in the face. The likeness is both a revelation and – supposedly – a fraud. We are told that only the upper head is ancient, the rest a 1660s restoration “based on hostile accounts”. Whereupon the British Museum presents a colour photograph of a modern recreation, in which Nero is a pocked redhead with a hideous neck beard; many removes, now, from any kind of truth. Yet vigilant visitors will notice lineaments of the very same physiognomy throughout the exhibition, in coins, reliefs, bronze and marble heads. The rudiments are even there in a statue of Nero as a boy, arms lifted angelically. The Capitoline bust can hardly be so scathing if it agrees with Nero’s own triumphalist propaganda. The show sustains its theatre from first to last. The imperial family tree spelled out in a parade of lifesize statues, ghostly in the gloom. Nero with a lyre (it was never a fiddle). Ceiling fragments from his golden palace, painted with gods and sphinxes. Exquisite silver horse trappings that once belonged to Pliny the Elder. The staging is superbly eventful, so that you move from pomp and circumstance straight into horrific reality – a colossal chain, looping heavily between neck rings, worn by slaves labouring for the Romans in Wales. This assault on humanity is so displayed to hang around your own head height, casting its vicious shadow on the earth below. Five necks, strung agonisingly close together: it is the most devastating sight in the show. Later, you are confronted by a pair of gladiators’ helmets, heavy as scuttles, caged over the face, and the massive thigh protectors that tell you these fighters were never small. The scale jumps are marvellous, from muckle warrior to tiny tragic actor, shuddering in shock; from outsize Nero to miniature marble slave boy, drooping over the lantern he is supposed to hold up. Apparently, there was a market for such kitsch, which says something about the Romans. Yet if a slave committed a crime, in Nero’s time, all the other slaves in the household could be killed. Mortality is palpable, even among the gilded dinner plates. Here is the gleaming Roman jewellery left behind when highborn Romans tried to outrun death, fleeing Boudicca in Colchester.

Experts warned earlier this year that the pandemic had sent levels of eating disorders soaring as people found themselves isolated during lockdowns and were left feeling out of control. Official statistics on deaths are based on the data collected as part of civil registration, which are based on the medical certificate of cause of death completed by a doctor, or the conclusions of a coroner following an inquest. Coroner Sean Horstead recently expressed concern over a possible “significant under-reporting” of eating disorder deaths. He said in a report looking at the deaths of five women that there was a “lack of robust and reliable data” around the illness. The coroner said that while eating disorders had the highest mortality rate of mental illnesses, he was “concerned that there may also be a significant underreporting of the extent to which eating disorders have caused or contributed to deaths”. Concern about a lack of research comes amid what has been dubbed a “crisis” in the growing number of people experiencing eating disorders who cannot get timely treatment. Data analysis by the Guardian shows a huge rise in the number of men experiencing problems, with NHS Digital data showing those presenting at hospital rose from 911 in 2016 to 1,825 in 2020. Ayton said this was likely to be the “tip of the iceberg” with eating disorders among men often a “hidden issue”. Ayton said men could experience eating disorders for decades and then present at clinics. “The admissions data is really the tip of the iceberg,” she said, adding that they faced increasing body image pressure and were also affected by anti-obesity messages from the government. Separately, figures show a sevenfold increase in the number of children and young people waiting for urgent care for an eating disorder and a 158.6% increase in those waiting for routine treatment compared with the same period last year. Nokes, who as the chair of the women and equalities committee helped to produce a report highlighting the impact the pandemic has had on how people view their bodies, said coronavirus had been a trigger as “social interactions and support networks have been ripped away from people”. She added: “There is a crisis in the number of people suffering from eating disorders but there is also a crisis in their ability to access timely support services … If someone presents showing they have a problem with eating and ask for help, the worst thing to do is turn them away and tell them to wait.” The minister for mental health, Nadine Dorries, said: “I recognise just how important it is for people with an eating disorder to get the support they need and I urge anyone who needs help to come forward. “Our commitment to expanding and transforming mental health services in England is backed by an additional £2.3bn a year by 2023-24, in addition to our mental health recovery action plan, ensuring we are offering the right access over the coming years that helps people with a variety of mental health conditions, including eating disorders.”","charCount":"4921","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/sarah-marsh\">Sarah Marsh</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2021/jun/06/coronavirus-live-news-tony-blair-greater-freedoms-fully-vaccinated-uk-matt-hancock-covid-latest-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-06T11:31:36Z","webTitle":"Covid live: eradicating virus not ‘reasonable target’, says WHO official;

But in an indication of Hancock’s likely approach when he is quizzed by the same parliamentary committee on Thursday, he argued that Cummings had not in fact accused him of wrongly claiming tests were already being done in March last year – only that they would happen when testing capacity was available. Eradicating Covid-19 from the world is not currently a “reasonable target”, a World Health Organization Covid-19 official has said. Dr David Nabarro, a special envoy to the WHO, said people will have to learn to live with the disease, comments which were echoed by Dame Anne Johnson, a professor of infection disease epidemiology at University College London (UCL). Nabarro told Sky News’ Trevor Phillips on Sunday: “Humanity is going to have to learn how to co-exist with this virus, preventing it from spiking and then surging and causing hotspots of disease, and we’re going to have to be able to do this for the foreseeable future. “Eradication is not currently a reasonable target for the world.” He said: “Each time there is a sudden surge, it does stimulate in one’s mind the thought that there might be a new variant appearing. That wouldn’t be surprising.” He said that will be “the pattern for the future”, adding: “This virus isn’t going away any time soon, there will be variants emerging.” A Dublin pub landlord has said the hospitality industry in Ireland faces difficulties replacing staff who left during the pandemic. Kevin Barden, whose family owns the traditional Irish music pub O’Donoghue’s, told PA Media he has been fortunate to welcome back 19 of his 20-strong team after 15 months of closure. Others have struggled to recruit staff and are finding it hard to fill roles ahead of reopening. “We’ve only lost one for the moment and hopefully we’ll get him back by the end of the summer. So we’ve been lucky enough – we’ve retained the majority of the staff here, which has been great.” Like so many workers across Ireland, the staff have received an income through government Covid-19 wage subsidy support. “They’ve obviously had to take a hit and they all have families and mortgages and bills to pay as well,” said Barden. It’s a month tomorrow since Public Health England published a report on the India variant in the UK when there were 509 identified cases. Since then the case numbers in the country have risen 20-fold and case numbers are continuing to rise. This thread from PHE expert Meaghan Kall on where things in England are now is well worth a read: Countries in the Asia-Pacific region are looking to develop their home-grown vaccines as supply shortages threaten efforts to tackle the pandemic. Japan, South Korea, India, Taiwan, Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam are hoping to develop their own jabs after struggling to get vaccines from overseas, according to the South China Morning Post. While locally developed vaccines aren’t likely to affect the pandemic in its current phase, they believe it’s a better long-term approach. Germany has registered 2,440 new cases in the last 24 hours, and 24.7 cases per 100,000 people, according to the country’s Robert Koch Institute. The latest figures show 74 more people have died from the virus, meaning the death toll now stands at 89,222. There has been a total of 3,700,367 positive tests for Covid since the start of the pandemic. The new Delta variant of coronavirus appears to be about 40% more transmissible than the variant it has largely replaced, Matt Hancock has said, making government decisions about whether to ease restrictions in England on 21 June “more difficult”. Saying that under-30s will be called to begin vaccinations from next week, the health secretary confirmed it was still possible the reopening programme could be delayed or some rules kept in place. “We consider all options,” he told Sky News. Away from the UK, Russia has reported 9,145 new Covid-19 cases and a further 399 deaths. A total of 5,117,274 people have tested positive in the country. The death toll in the country now stands at 123,436. Russia’s own state statistics service, Rosstat, keeps its own records and said on Friday that about 270,000 people had died from the virus and related causes as of April. Excess deaths in the county stand at 425,000 from between April 2020 and April 2021. Marr rounds off by asking whether the health secretary regretted using the phrase about a “protective ring” around care homes. “I said that much later about what we were doing for the winter plans, but it’s been interpreted,” he says, but changes the subject on to the return of children to school tomorrow after half-term. “On testing, tomorrow schoolchildren will be going back to school. You must get tests done this evening because right now secondary school-age children getting their tests done tonight is the most important thing that can be done today.” Marr asks whether Hancock will apologise for any failings on his part during the pandemic, as Cummings did. “At that time everybody was working as hard as possible to protect as many lives as possible on the evidence we had at the time,” he says. “This is true of different administrations and across the whole of Europe. “I know those decisions were taken on the best evidence with the best of intentions.” Marr ends by asking whether Hancock’s been honest and transparent during the pandemic after claims made by Dominic Cummings during his select committee appearance last week. He plays a clip of Cummings saying that in March 2020 Hancock said people would be tested before they went back to care homes and there was a protective shield around them. “It’s complete nonsense,” Cummings said. He asks Hancock whether he told Johnson that people would be tested before they went into care homes. He replies: “We know the testing wasn’t available to test everybody. The advice was that very few people would be able to pass on Covid if they didn’t have any symptoms, so we reserved that for people with symptoms. “The situation with regards to care homes, we brought in a policy of wanting to test everybody going into a care home as soon as we had those tests available. Everyone had a challenge around Europe, in Scotland in Wales, some of the most vulnerable to Covid live in care homes, but at the time, you’ll remember we didn’t have the testing capacity and I built that up, put in place the hundreds of thousands targets and then we could put that into place.” On the idea of children being vaccinated, Hancock says the government is following clinical advice. “There’s good advantages, there’s the reduction in transmission from children to parents and grandparents who might be vulnerable. There’s advantages in protecting education, if one child gets one positive test, the whole bubble has to isolate. “We should follow and listen to clinical advice … I don’t want to put pressure on them with their advice. People should be reassured that whatever steps we take they are on a clinically advised basis.” In response to a question about vaccine passports, or certification along the lines mentioned by Tony Blair, Hancock says: “We know some other countries are going to require it. So if you want to go some other countries, you already have to, the EU are talking about it. It’s my job to make sure you can have that. “If you download the NHS app right now and register it will show you your vaccine status, so you can prove it if you want to go to Greece, for example.” He says rules in the UK are down to a certification review and that there is downsides on a mandatory basis. Hancock repeats Sage’s findings that the India variant is 40% more transmissible. In turn Marr quotes a Sage report saying that a variant of that level of transmissibility would cause severe disruption to the roadmap. Hancock says: “We’re watching the case rates and the rate in which that transfers into hospitalisations. Thankfully that link, which was absolutely rock solid over the autumn, is severed but not broken. There are some people in hospital who have been double vaccinated, but very few. The majority in hospital haven’t been. “Critically, those who are double vaccinated, even if they’re in hospital, they appear to be less ill. The vaccine is working and is our way through it, the new variant, which is more transmissible is making that calculation harder.” Matt Hancock’s now appearing on Marr, after his earlier interview on Sky News’ Trevor Phillips on Sunday. He first responds to an earlier interview by Bob Geldof calling for more vaccines to go to developing countries. The health secretary references Boris Johnson’s call to get the planet vaccinated by the end of 2022, and the rollout of the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab at cost to low and middle income countries. The cut to the aid budget, he says, is supposed to be temporary. “We also have this enormous cost there, so we can continue investing in the NHS, which we are doing, but there’s many things we are doing, leadership on climate change and certainly the work that AZ and Oxford University have done that a quarter of the vaccines across the whole world are delivered with UK taxpayers cash, at cost, no charge on intellectual property, and that’s saving lives everywhere.” Nandy backs vaccination for children after the JCVI’s approval of the Pfizer jab for 12-15 year olds. “I think the regulator has been clear that for 12-year-olds and over the Pfizer vaccine is safe and it’s apparent that the rise in transmission rates is being driven by young people. “It’s right to follow the public health officials particularly the ones that are saying ‘this is what we want to do’. “If public health directors are saying ‘we’ve got a problem in our secondary schools and we need to open up the vaccine, not to make it mandatory, offer the chance to get them vaccinated’, then we need to listen. If we’d taken that approach from the start we’d be in a far better place now.” On international travel Nandy says she believes the current Amber list for international travel from the UK should be scrapped. Current rules mean people travelling to the UK from those countries must quarantine at home or the place they are staying for 10 days and take two Covid tests during that period. She adds: “It’s confusing and that confusion is dangerous at the moment and risks unravelling all the progress that we’ve made. “I think we should have robust quarantine measures for people coming back into the country. “We need to be much clearer that at the moment travelling overseas, particularly when you’ve got countries like Vietnam and Thailand on the amber list where new variants are emerging and being imported into the UK, is the wrong thing to do and the government ought to be clear about that.” Labour’s shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy tells Marr says she’s sceptical on a domestic level on vaccine passports. “I think the global case for vaccine passports is clear because other countries are doing it, but at a domestic level for many of the reasons that you’ve highlighted, discriminatory practices, how they would be enforced, I think there are potentially real problems.” Here’s more detail on the proposal put forward by the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change. People who have been vaccinated against Covid-19 should be able to travel abroad using a new digital pass and go to “vaccine-only” venues such as restaurants or sports stadiums, Tony Blair says today. Releasing a report entitled “Less Risk, More Freedom”, by the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, the former prime minister says the time has come “to distinguish for the purposes of freedom from restriction between the vaccinated and unvaccinated”. The report argues that to date, measures intended to reduce the spread of disease have treated populations as largely homogenous groups. As a result, restrictions – such as national lockdowns, regional-tier systems and entire schools closed following outbreaks – have been blunt instruments. Tony Blair’s on BBC One’s Andrew Marr Show. He says he thinks it’s “uncertain” as to whether the UK will carry on with rules being relaxed on 21 June. Marr says that with introducing vaccine passports or certification status, it will end up discriminating against people who have not had the jab. Blair replies: “Discrimination has got a very loaded meaning in the English Language now. Really when it comes to risk management it’s all about discrimination. The reason we vaccinate the elderly first is that they are more at risk. The reason we ensure people are vaccinated is that we reduce the risk of transmission.” In response to a follow-up question, the former prime minister adds that there needs to be exemptions made for certain groups, including the disabled, as it would be “totally inappropriate” to discriminate against them. Taiwan reported 343 new Covid-19 cases on Sunday, down from 511 reported the day before. The US announced on Sunday that it will give it 750,000 vaccine doses. Phillips asks if we could be giving more vaccines to other countries ahead of the G7 summit next week. Hancock says: “My first duty is to protect the UK population, and that’s to reduce transmission. The way we’re helping the rest of the world is giving away at cost the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine and that means of the 2 billion doses delivered across the world, 500m doses are the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. 70% of those doses are in low and middle-income countries. “The reason we’ve been able to do this is is that we’ve made it available at cost, no charge of intellectual property from the start. I’m delighted there’s a debate, around the G7 table on how to vaccinate the world, but this country has done more than any other by ensuring the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is available at cost.” Responding on whether the government will respond to Blair’s call earlier (see 8.19), for global vaccine passports, as well as relaxations domestically for people who have had the jab. Hancock says: “This debate has been going on for months and we’ve been doing the work inside government, and we’ll be coming out with our answers on that soon. “We know it’s going to be needed internationally, on the domestic front, that’s a matter for Michael Gove.” Phillips asks if the government will want to vaccinate all children. The UK regulator, Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, approved the Pfizer jab for use on children aged between 12 and 15 earlier this week. A story in the Sunday Telegraph said that under plans drawn up by Whitehall, they would be offered the jab from mid-August. Hancock doesn’t rule it out, and says: “We’ve got a few weeks until we come out with a plan on how and if we take this forward. “We know the vaccine both protects you and helps stops it transmitting, and I want to protect education as much as anybody does. Making sure we don’t have those whole bubbles going home and the isolation, that has big upsides for education.” Under-30s are being invited to get their jabs this week, Hancock adds, as he says the link between infection and serious illness has been “severed but not broken” by the vaccine. Phillips asks whether there will be a modification of the roadmap, such as lifting lockdown but still asking people to work from home. “There are a series of things at the moment that we’ve said will be part of step four, which include the rule of six and the fact there’s still some businesses that are closed. “We have four reviews into international travel and certification and social distancing, and we are concluding those reviews and doing that at the same time.” Hancock urges people to go and get their second dose to try and stop the damage being caused by the India variant, that is 40% more transmissible. “It’s more difficult to manage this virus with the new variant. But after two doses of vaccine we are confident that you get the same protection as you did with the old variant. “The vaccine works just as effectively, and everyone must get their second jab though, as the first on its own isn’t quite as effective.” The health secretary Matt Hancock is on Sky News’ Trevor Phillips on Sunday, as part of a morning broadcast tour. He asks Hancock whether there will be a delay to the relaxing of restrictions on 21 June. “It’s too early to make a final decision on that,” Hancock begins. “The prime minister and the team will be looking over all the data over this week and we’ve said we will be giving people enough time ahead of 21 June when this is pencilled in, this next step.” He says it will depend on the four tests; cases, hospitalisations, the rollout of the vaccine and the impact of new variants. Hancock admits that there has been a significant impact of the Delta variant. Boris Johnson will urge G7 leaders to “defeat Covid” by vaccinating the world by the end of next year. The prime minister will stress the importance of the programme when he meets leaders on Friday in Cornwall for the first face-to-face G7 meeting since the beginning of the pandemic. The US, France, Germany, Italy and Japan have all said how many doses they will donate to the global vaccine programme, Covax. However the UK and Canada are yet to announce how many they will contribute. Johnson will also call for a global watch system to catch new variants before they spread more widely. Johnson said: “I’m calling on my fellow G7 leaders to join us to end this terrible pandemic and pledge will we never allow the devastation wreaked by coronavirus to happen again.” Head of the UK vaccines taskforce Kate Bingham is to be given a damehood, the Telegraph has reported, after getting the UK access to millions of doses of six different jabs. Her expected honour is among a number in next week’s Queen’s Birthday honours dedicated to “heroes” in the pandemic. Bingham was appointed to the role in May last year and left at the end of 2020. People who have had both doses of a Covid-19 vaccine should have restrictions relaxed for them, according to former prime minister Tony Blair. Blair’s thinktank, the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, sets out how the country should remain open if the virus persists in the population. The report, Less Risk, More Freedom, says that the NHS app – which is currently used for contact tracing – should be replaced with a system of global health passes. “The health pass needs to be usable both by national border authorities and other organisations within countries. It should also include the ability to demonstrate time-restricted testing status for those who aren’t able to be vaccinated. “With this ability to securely prove vaccination status, we can move beyond blunt, catch-all tools and align with other countries by removing certain restrictions for the fully vaccinated – thereby enabling us to sustainably reopen the economy,” the report says.

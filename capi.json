Swiatek faces a potentially tricky tie against 30th seed Estonian Anett Kontaveit this afternoon, scheduled on court at 3pm. Barbora Krejcikova will be the opposition for Elina Svitolina (5) on Philippe-Chatrier from 11am, while the fourth seed Sofia Kenin meets her American compatriot Jessica Pegula on Court Suzanne Lenglen.

Musetti goes 5-1 up against Cecchinato! He will serve for the match, and a place in the last 16. Jannik Sinner is 3-1 up on Mikael Ymer on Court 14 in their first set. Now, over to Court 7, and this all-Italian five-set marathon between Cecchinato (ranked 83) and Musetti (ranked 76). Musetti, the 19-year-old, has just gone 4-1 up in this final set, so is in a commanding position. Krejcikova speaks: “I’m super happy ... I can’t really believe it. I’m so happy I was able to play my tennis, the game plan was working, I think most of my shots they’ve been actually amazing. This was, so far I think, my best match, I’m so happy that I’m here, that I’m enjoying the game, that I’m entertaining the crowd ... thank you so much for coming today. I’m just extremely happy.” Regarding that 21-minute hold of serve in the first set, at 4-3, she adds: “Every game is important ... especially against Elina because she is such a great fighter, it’s so hard to play against her so I think every single point actually counts. That game was for sure very important, I made it to the 5-3 and I was able to break her and take the first set.” Stunning! The world No 6 is out! What an accomplished performance that was by the Czech 25-year-old, who initially made her name as a doubles player. The world No 33 Krejcikova will face Sloane Stephens in the last 16. Two match points for Krejcikova! Svitolina crunches a backhand winner down the line to fight back to 15-15 in this crucial service game. Krejcikova is totally unflustered, though, and finds a lovely forehand winner in the next point after battling to control a baseline rally. Game point for Krejcikova to make it 5-2 vs Svitolina. And BOOM! She wins the game with a massive forehand after an indifferent forehand to the middle of the court by her opponent. Krejcikova is one game away from a resounding victory against the No 5 seed. Svitolina battles back to hold serve and it’s 4-2. The audio from Court 7 (Cecchinato v Musetti) is coming through on Eurosport’s coverage of Krejcikova v Svitolina, for some reason, but we’ll struggle on. We have the audio for the match on telly, too, so we’re doubling up. Krejcikova earns two break points. There is an exchange of slow, looping, high-bouncing shots from the baseline, before Svitolina moves in for the kill and smashes a forehand winner. And another forehand winner, and it’s deuce! Svitolina may be rattled by the form of her opponent but she’s battling on. In the men’s: Cecchinato and Musetti are engaged in a five-set epic now: 6-3, 4-6, 3-6, 6-4, 0-0. Krejcikova holds for 4-1. Can Svitolina find something - anything - to stop Krejcikova’s seemingly relentless progress towards the last 16? Krejcikova just needs to hold serve and she’s through. Another break for Barbora Krejcikova! It’s 3-1 and she is crushing the ball all over the court now - mixing it up with the odd drop shot - and Svitolina seems to have little answer. Svitolina breaks back for 2-1! The Ukrainian isn’t going to go down without a fight. Now, to Court Philippe-Chatrier, where a shock is brewing: Barbora Krejcikova of the Czech Republic is 2-0 up against fifth seed Elina Svitolina in the second set, after winning the first set 6-3. The first set featured a 20-minute service game for Krejcikova which she eventually held. She has hit 30 winners so far. Cédric Pioline, on post-match interview duty, tells the 10th seed Schwartzman that the crowd love him. “It’s a very special place to me,” Schwartzman tells Pioline of his feelings for Roland Garros as the cheers ring out. “I’m very happy to be back, to play my best tennis again, and with a crowd. Last year was my best tournament here, but not many people could come [due to lockdown] and I’m very happy to play with a lot of people here this week. “I was thinking to play every single point, as many shots I can ... he [Kohlschreiber] was not playing a lot of tournaments since last year ... so I was thinking to play a long match ... at the end, he was not running very well. “Now we can have time to walk around Paris this afternoon. I’m very happy, because now I have two days [off] before the second week here in Paris. Everything is perfect right now.” The diminutive Argentinian smokes a forehand down the line, and seals an utterly dominant win against the 37-year-old German. Schwartzman, the Argentinian, is 5-1 up in his third set against Kohlschreiber on Court Suzanne Lenglen. He angles a beautiful cushioned volley across court, and a point later, he has his first match point ... he sends the ball long, though, and it’s back to deuce on Kohlschreiber’s serve. That was a very, very entertaining two hours of tennis. Muchova sends a forehand long and Stephens is through with a top-drawer performance. Can the 2018 runner-up do something special this year? Stephens gives Muchova a smile as they shake hands - and then a big round of applause as the Czech leaves the court. A great spirit between the players - and a fine display of hitting from both of them. Muchova hits a blinding forehand winner. Stephens answers straight back, and has two match points. Stephens speeds to 30-0 and is two points away from the last 16 ... Stephens breaks! 6-5 to the resurgent American now, and she can serve for the match. Schwartzman is now 3-1 up against Kohlschreiber and seemingly easing to a straight-sets win. Stephens v Muchova is a much more interesting spectacle. Lovely variation now from Stephens, who produces a drop shot of her own: Muchova sprints and gets it back, but Stephens clumps a confident volleyed winner back into the open court. She now has three break points! Stephens holds for 5-5. Krejcikova and Svitolina are playing a marathon first set - it’s 4-3 there at the moment, Krejcikova with the second break and serving for 5-3. Whoah! Fantastic forehand winner down the line, on the slide, from Muchova and she creates a sniff of a chance at 40-30 on the Stephens serve. And now she takes it to deuce with another excellently-judged drop shot. Another classy drop shot from Muchova early in this service game from Stephens. But Stephens moves to 40-15 with a tremendous, powerful forehand that Muchova - attacking the net - cannot get back. Muchova digs out the game for 5-4. It’s been excellent from both players, this match. And that is a really gritty and calm effort from Muchova to fight back from 15-40 down and take the game - and, effectively, stay alive in the tournament. Muchova wins a game point, but a fine, deep return from Stephens forces an error and we’re back to deuce. Muchova forces it back to deuce after a long rally! Very, very impressive. Neither player held back there, despite the importance of the point. Stephens eventually sends a forehand wide and Muchova has parity. Now, two break points for Stephens after a couple of errors from Muchova. Muchova saves the first and it’s 30-40. Huge point coming up, can Stephens break again? Krejcikova and Svitolina are level at 3-3 in their first set, both with a break. Now Muchova, showing plenty of fight, forces a break point and she gets it! She’s broken back for 4-4 in the second set, and Stephens has more work to do. Now a break point for Stephens against Muchova! Muchova can’t afford to lose this point. But she does, directing a backhand into the net. Stephens is well set now, a break up once again, 4-3 in the second set, already a set to the good. Schwartzman is two sets up now against Kohlschreiber: 6-4, 6-2. Musetti, meanwhile, has hit back to level at 1-1 in sets against Cecchinato: 6-3, 4-6. If you missed it, here is a news story from yesterday regarding the arrest of the Russian player, Yana Sizikova, over allegations of spot-fixing in last year’s French Open: It’s 3-3! Stephens holds serve to draw level in the second set. Muchova has tightened up her game and is making life much tougher for Stephens now. The American puts a backhand into the net for deuce in the sixth game of the second set. Following a washout at Lord’s yesterday, it’s game on in St John’s Wood this morning in the first England v New Zealand Test match. Tim de Lisle is covering the action here: It’s been extremely high-quality tennis here, so much so, it’s a big surprise when Muchova tamely finds the net with a backhand from the baseline. That makes it 30-30 and it’s a chance for Stephens: but now the American puts a shot of her own into the net from the back of the court for 40-30 to Muchova. Muchova closes out the game and it’s 3-2 to the Czech in the second set. Muchova now advances to the net and produced a lovely angled drop, then smacks a backhanded winner for 30-0. She’s on top right now. Stephens answers back, dispatching a fine backhand winner on a short ball. She’s done it! Stephens chases down a drop shot, opening up the right of the court, and Muchova passes to break back! Great point, and a great game. It’s 2-2 in the second set and Muchova is back in it! Muchova is noticeably timing the ball a lot better in the last few games, really starting to get a feel for it. Muchova gets it wrong again. She’s had four break points so far in this match and converted none of them. Now, here’s a fifth ... can she do it? Now, a chance for Muchova to break back ... she gains advantage on Stephens’ serve, but then inexplicably sends a forehand well wide. But next up, Muchova digs out a stunning volley at the net for another break point! On Court Philippe-Chatrier, the fifth seed Svitolina has started her match against Krejcikova. Schwartzman leads Kohlschreiber 3-1 in their second set (the Argentinian also won the first set, 6-4), while Musetti is 4-3 up on Cecchinato in that second set. A perfectly-judged drop shot from Muchova and she’s on the board in the second set, at 2-1 to Stephens. Stephens has fallen down the rankings of late - according to the commentators, in fact, she won just four matches throughout the whole of 2020 - but this performance has been well above her current ranking of 59 in the world. Muchova hasn’t played badly but Stephens has exerted control with every area of her game. Stephens holds comfortably for 2-0 in the second set. Muchova is very much second best here. Muchova has won just one out of 11 points when she’s come to the net, so she probably needs to rethink that tactic. Muchova sends a forehand long, after another entertaining rally, to seal a Stephens break at the start of the first set! Trouble for Muchova. Schwartzman wins the first set against Kohlschreiber, 6-4. Stephens wins the first set, 6-3! This has been a really interesting and engaging contest: Muchova has been mixing things up with a few clever drop shots, but Stephens has generally been in the ascendancy, taking every advantage with her accomplished forehand and showing ability to dictate the terms of many of the rallies from the baseline. Muchova moves to 40-0 on her serve, including a drop shot that flicks off the net cord (Muchova raising a hand by way of apology), and a lob which Stephens decided not to play but drops just inside the tramlines. Muchova then seals a love hold with another drop shot - and the American Stephens will serve for the first set at 5-3. Schwartzman is really making Kohlschreiber work to hold serve in that first set, but the German finally does it, and it’s 5-4 to the Argentinian who will try to serve it out now. Cecchinato wins his first set against Musetti, 6-3. The Stephens forehand is causing Muchova plenty of issues. The American earns a second advantage - and wins the game when the Czech sends a volley long. The umpire gets out of his seat and jogs to the back of the court to check the mark, raises his finger in confirmation, and it’s 5-2 to Stephens in this very engaging first set. Muchova takes it deuce on Stephens’ serve. Muchova then wins a break point with a fine, powerful forehand into the corner on her opponent’s backhand side. But Stephens then saves the break point with a big forehand of her own which Muchova can only dump in the net. On court, Stephens and Muchova both hold serve, and it’s 4-2 in the first set. Kohlschreiber is serving to stay in the first set against Schwartman at 3-5. Sloane Stephens has had a terribly tough year, having lost two grandparents and an aunt to Covid-19, and has said that she wishes she had attended her grandparents’ funeral instead of being in isolation ahead of the Australian Open: “I should have asked to go to my grandparents’ funeral,” she told the New York Times earlier this week. “I should have made those inquiries and seen if I could get out of the bubble and go home. I didn’t. It’s something that I’ll probably regret for the rest of my life, because I prioritized my tennis over things that were happening in my life. The only thing I can do now is move on and move forward. There’s nothing wrong with having a therapist or two and a grief counselor and all of these things. I have to do what’s best for me and work on myself.” Schwartzman has broken Kohlschreiber, to go 4-2 up, and now Stephens breaks Muchova for 3-1 in the first set! Elsewhere in the men’s singles, Marco Cecchinato is 4-2 up on Lorenzo Musetti on Court 7. Stephens wins a break point with a lovely sliced backhand down the line. Muchova saves it with a delicate (and brave) drop shot - a much better effort than her previous one. Stephens is seeing it - and hitting it - remarkably well. She wrests control of a rally with a booming backhand, crosscourt, and finishes off the point in style. She is dictating the terms more often than not. Schwartzman and Kohlschreiber are under way on Suzanne Lenglen and it’s 2-2 in the first set. Stephens wins four points in a row to hold her second service game, and it’s 2-1 in the American’s favour against Muchova. Muchova finally manages to hold: she had to work for that, and this is shaping up to be a closely-fought - and very entertaining - affair. 1-1. Muchova tries a drop shot for the first time but Stephens runs it down easily and puts away a forehand winner. Back to deuce. Muchova is now having to work to hold her first service game. Stephens takes it to deuce after a marathon rally, both players hitting wonderfully well early in this match. Muchova grabs advantage, but Stephens stays aliver with an excellent forehand on to Muchova’s toes as the Czech comes forward, and she can only direct it into the net. Sloane Stephens holds serve against Karolina Muchova to begin their third-round match. It was an interesting first game, with both players hitting the ball sweetly and powerfully. Muchova produced one brilliant clean backhanded winner on Stephens’ second serve, but Stephens generally had the best of the rallies and she is on the board in solid style. Here is Tumaini Carayol’s report from yesterday, including Serena Williams’ win against Danielle Collins, as well as Aryna Sabalenka’s defeat by Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova: Sloane Stephens v Karolina Muchova (seeded 18) is first up on Court Simonne Mathieu, a match I will focus on to begin with. I’ll bring you live scores from across the other courts, of course. If you have any thoughts on the day’s action, you can drop me an email or tweet @LukeMcLaughlin. As the days tick by at Roland Garros and the field thins out, the big guns are naturally becoming more noticeable in the order of play: the men’s singles today sees Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal take to the clay for their third-round matches. Nadal, the 13-times French Open champion, will go into battle later today against Cameron Norrie, the British No 2, while Djokovic takes on Ricardas Berankis of Lithuania and Federer meets the left-handed German Dominik Koepfer. British fans will be fascinated to see how Norrie gets on: he was impressively consistent in his second-round win against Lloyd Harris, but will he have the weapons to trouble the king of clay? We will find out from around 1.15pm. In the women’s competition, a few big names have admittedly fallen early: Naomi Osaka withdrew, sparking a global debate about mental health and media coverage which rumbles on, while Ash Barty, the world No 1, was forced to retire from the tournament with a hip injury. The reigning champion Iga Swiatek of Poland is still very much in contention, however, in ominous form, and is clearly feeling increasingly confident about a second title.

Following yesterday’s wash-out, more than half the playing time has already elapsed, and we’ve only had an innings and a bit.

Robinson has done well to steady the ship, after threatening to scupper it with those terrible tweets. And Burns is still there, albeit so becalmed that he’s being outscored by a bowler making his debut. Like his opposite number Devon Conway, Burns has seen a lot of partners come and go. So England still need 15 to avoid the follow-on. And the morning belongs to Tim Southee, who showed up a gauche middle order with a spell of exemplary swing bowling. See you in half an hour. It was off the pad only, as Robinson had realised. You wait ages for a mistake from Michael Gough, and then he makes two in one morning. Off the spinner, Santner, at short leg. He reviews straight away, so maybe it’s not out... 67th over: England 164-6 (Burns 72, Robinson 16) One more to each batsman as England continue to get ’em in singles. The partnership has crept to 24 and could really do with adding another 15. 66th over: England 162-6 (Burns 71, Robinson 15) Just a single off Jamieson as the cameras find a pair of small boys in T-shirts, with their dad, I presume. They must be about 9 and 11 and are busy with a scorebook, one filling it in, the other keeping a close eye on him. That was me and my brother Charlie when New Zealand came here in 1973. Be warned, lads: you may both become cricket writers, and one of you could end up on the OBO. 65th over: England 161-6 (Burns 70, Robinson 15) Burns nudges a single off Wagner, who is pitching it up rather than bombing him, presumably because the bombs can bring boundaries. “Whiffs of 80s and 90s nostalgia,” says Colum Fordham, “as England embark on a trademark collapse and try admirably to set up a New Zealand victory AGAINST ALL ODDS. Though writing from a surprisingly Lords-like overcast Naples, I just heard from my brother Kit in London who has been down to the graveyard with his young sons to play a bit of cricket (interesting location, I know, but apt). One of my nephews made a six and out. I’m sure he was influenced by England’s callow young middle-order batsmen. My brother has just opened another can of cider to ease the pain.” As emails go, that’s more of a novella. 64th over: England 160-6 (Burns 69, Robinson 15) Robinson gets a touch too confident, wafting at a lifter from Jamieson with the bat dangling at 45 degrees – neither one thing nor the other. He’s then beaten on the inside edge as Jamieson gets the shape back in with which he started the proceedings today. Still 19 needed to avoid the follow-on, and Robinson may have to get most of them – as Mike Atherton points out, Rory Burns has made only 10 this morning, off 60 balls. The wheel is there to be grabbed if he can manage it. 64th over: England 160-6 (Burns 69, Robinson 15) Here is Wagner, whose bowling in this game hasn’t been quite as hot as his batting. Robinson greets him with another good shot, a clip for three. “Can we talk,” says Tom King, “about that terrible Jet advert played between overs? It’s as if they’re trying to find the least crickety sound possible.” I’ll have to take your word for it, Tom. Between overs, I’m so busy stringing a sentence together, I wouldn’t hear a clap of thunder. 63rd over: England 157-6 (Burns 69, Robinson 12) So we do get a bowling change, but instead of Wagner for de Grandhomme, it’s Jamieson for Southee. His extra height induces a wacky shot from Robinson, who steps away and slashes over the slips for four. He thus becomes the fourth Englishman to reach double figures in this innings. To celebrate, he plays a much better stroke, a back-foot glide to cover point that deserves more than a single. Here endeth the masterclass. 62nd over: England 151-6 (Burns 69, Robinson 7) de Grandhomme goes back to joining the dots. Time for a burst of Neil Wagner, surely. 61st over: England 151-6 (Burns 69, Robinson 7) Williamson seems to have decided to bowl Southee all day long. For a change he tries a bouncer, which Burns pulls crisply but only for a single. In the commentary box are Ian Ward and Rob Key, and Ward is scoffing at Key’s ignorance of the fact that the Lord’s floodlights bob up and down (they’re up now, even though the sky is largely blue). Key takes it very genially, so the attempt at one-upmanship rather backfires. 60th over: England 150-6 (Burns 68, Robinson 7) de Grandhomme concedes a few singles, for once, so England make it to a minor milestone. They need another 29 to see off the possibility of the follow-on. Here’s Richard O’Hagan again. “I know that there’s a lot of 90s nostalgia around at the moment – music reviews, Euro 96 reviews and so on – but England being thrashed by NZ was one memory I really didn’t want to revisit.” 59th over: England 147-6 (Burns 67, Robinson 5) Robinson plays his first decent shot, a firm push down the ground off Southee, which is saved by a diving stop from Kane Williamson. If he’d thought about it, Williamson might have let it trickle for four, to give Southee a few more goes at Robinson. Southee could afford to concede the extra run: his spell now stands at 11-6-18-3, and it may have won the match. 58th over: England 143-6 (Burns 66, Robinson 2) Burns needs to get a move on, but de Grandhomme isn’t the bowler you’d choose for that scenario. He keeps it tight apart from a big fat no-ball. Burns has only five from his last 30 balls, so the question now is whether he can take charge. “Just done a team sprint triathlon in Leeds (I know I know, anything to get out of the house),” says Guy Hornsby. “Checked my phone after the finish to a flurry of notifications. I thought ‘it can’t be the cricket’ but... Of COURSE IT CAN. I know we’re keen on a result but.... Oh England.” 57th over: England 142-6 (Burns 66, Robinson 2) One debutant gives way to another as Ollie Robinson comes in. His first Test has been a right old rollercoaster – four wickets and one disgrace, albeit from years ago. And he nearly gets a golden duck, just saving himself from a big LBW shout by getting an inside edge. Robinson can bat, but he hasn’t shown it yet – he gets off the mark with a leaden-footed squirt through the slips. This is riveting. Another duck! Poor Bracey’s first Test innings comes to a miserable end as Southee bends one back up the slope and the bat goes some way down the wrong line. England have lost three for none in 21 balls. It’s a classic English collapse, and they still need 39 to avoid the follow-on. 56th over: England 140-5 (Burns 66, Bracey 0) Time for a bowling change, as Jamieson takes a breather and Colin de Mullet comes on. It’s a maiden from him to Burns, and that’s drinks, with New Zealand well on top. England’s grown-ups have been fine, making 108 runs for once out, while the kids are all wrong – Sibley 0, Crawley 2, Pope 22, Lawrence 0. These ducks and twos won’t do: if you’re going to struggle, at least stick around for half an hour. “You see,” says Richard O’Hagan, “this is why England picked a top-order batter at number 7. It all makes sense now.” 55th over: England 140-5 (Burns 66, Bracey 0) And here comes James Bracey, on debut. Facing the demon Southee, he leaves one that’s a little too close for comfort, then traps a full ball in the crease like a footballer. But he’s survived five balls, which is three more than Lawrence managed. Southee’s spell now: 9-6-11-2, Timmy with a strong whiff of Jimmy. Another one! Southee sends down a piece of sheer temptation, in the form of a full outswinger. And Lawrence takes the bait, giving Colin de Grandhomme, at third slip, a catch so simple that he could have held it in his mullet. 54th over: England 140-4 (Burns 66, Lawrence 0) Dan Lawrence has come in, but has only faced one ball so far. He is England’s sixth specialist batsman, something that hardly ever happened under Ed Smith – who is having rather a good game, as absent friends often do. 53rd over: England 140-4 (Burns 66, Lawrence 0) Great stuff from Southee, whose spell has been impeccable: 8-5-11-1. “I wonder,” says David Reynolds, “if any of your readers might know what ails the overseas TMS feed. To begin with, the Youtube page for Day 4 produced no sound, and now the link for it has disappeared from the BBC Cricket page. In the meantime, this Middlesex man is hoping for oodles of Surrey runs today.” Yes, he’s gone! It was a very plumb plumb, and Southee knew it. Gough is not God after all. And Pope’s promising innings turns out to be a mere cameo. The only reason to think this is not out is that Michael Gough said so, and he is hardly ever wrong. 52nd over: England 140-3 (Burns 66, Pope 22) A glance from Pope, so he gets down the other end, the better to decide who it is that Jamieson really resembles. And finally we have a commanding shot from Burns, clipping for four in front of square. He could do with a hundred here after six consecutive Tests of diddly squat. 51st over: England 135-3 (Burns 62, Pope 21) After that flurry of runs, Southee decides a maiden is required, and Burns obliges. “Jamieson just offered up one cheeky grin too many,” says Robert Cookson, “and I realised that he has more than a passing resemblance to a youthful Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson. I’m done for the day.” Kyle Jamieson thus becomes the first person ever to be likened to both B Johnson and R Redford in the same morning. 50th over: England 135-3 (Burns 62, Pope 21) Burns takes a single off Jamieson, and Pope clips a blameless ball square for four. Isa Guha heard him taking guard and asking for middle-and-off, which enables a shot like that – but if he misses, playing a ball on middle stump with half a bat, he’ll be plumb. Intriguing stuff. 49th over: England 130-3 (Burns 61, Pope 17) Pope, freed from the shackles of Jamieson, spots a half-volley from Southee and creams it to the extra-cover boundary. That’s the shot of the morning, not that the bar is a high one. And then it’s trumped by an on-drive off a pretty good ball, swinging out from middle-and-leg. Pope is moving the game along at a good lick, which is just what it needs. “Jamieson has something of the Tremlett about him, don’t you think?” says Kevin Wilson. “Not super quick, about Anderson or Broad pace, but he just looks huge! A lovely, flowing action too. Broad is the same height more or less but wouldn’t intimidate me half as much as Jamieson would.” Broad, right now, only intimidates coaches and people called Warner. But with a bit of luck he’ll see himself being written off and get 6 for 20 in the second innings. 48th over: England 122-3 (Burns 61, Pope 9) Another four to Pope, another thick edge off Jamieson, but with a bit more control this time. Then we get the first single of the day, as Pope nudges to fine leg. Burns, facing Jamieson for the first time, is turned around and slammed on the back pad. There’s a big appeal but the ump reckons it’s too high. Ooh – umpire’s call. On this evidence Jamieson is much like Ollie Robinson, but even more effective, because taller and that bit more experienced. 47th over: England 117-3 (Burns 61, Pope 4) With the ball moving sideways, Rory Burns – who does plenty of that himself – looks like a wicket waiting to happen. But he’s a fighter and he gets off the mark for the morning with a shovel for two off Southee. 46th over: England 115-3 (Burns 59, Pope 4) We have some runs! Four of them, to Ollie Pope, but off a thick edge – a bit of a grope from Pope. And next ball he plays and misses. How many do England need to avoid the follow-on? Another 60 or so. 45th over: England 111-3 (Burns 59, Pope 0) At the other end – running in from the Pavilion – it’s Tim Southee, and he too is swinging it round corners. Rory Burns does well to keep him out. The England players have a new word emblazoned on their chests: cinch, which is exactly what this isn’t. “Good morning,” says John Starbuck. “At this rate, we might get a man carrying his bat after all, if Burns can retain his poise and do the business.” 44th over: England 111-3 (Burns 59, Pope 0) That’s a wicket maiden and a fabulous start from Jamieson, who is finding big swing as well as steep bounce. And he looks like Robert Redford on stilts. It’s the first ball and ... Joe Root is caught at first slip! Slight doubt over whether the catch was clean, but it was - well held Ross Taylor, and well bowled Kyle Jamieson. The shot was the classic fend, off the back foot, and England have lost their only experienced batsman. The players are out there, and the sun is not – though there’s plenty of blue in the sky.

It might not have the same ring as “Dreamtime at the ‘G” but given the era of Covid that we live in, we should be grateful it is happening at all. And why not share the love? Optus Stadium will no doubt do the game justice, with ticket sales going gangbusters and the venue record for an AFL game – 59,608, for the 2018 preliminary final between West Coast and Melbourne – under serious threat.</p> <p>The pin-up match of Sir Doug Nicholls Round should be quite a contest, too, with both Richmond and Essendon in winning form and sniffing around the lower reaches of the top eight. A win for either team tonight will do their finals chances the world of good. For their part, the Bombers will be delighted to return to the stadium where last week they toppled West Coast. They will need to draw on the good vibes generated by that upset victory if they are to avoid an 11th successive defeat at the hands of the Tigers. </p> <p>Looking forward to this great fixture of the AFL calendar.

Cometh the hour, cometh Dustin Martin. Dusty takes a diving mark on 50 before playing on in traffic to kick a big goal and hammer a dagger into the heart of the Dons. Q4: 8 mins remaining: Essendon 12-11 (83) vs Richmond 14-9 (93) Richmond goal! Classy stuff from Bolton, who is in the right place at the right time to mop up Riewoldt’s centring kick before snapping a big goal with his right boot. Q4: 9 mins remaining: Essendon 12-11 (83) vs Richmond 13-9 (87) Richmond goal! The Tigers are back in front as Castagna works into space inside-50 and converts after marking smartly. Another twist and likely there will be more to this tale. Q4: 11 mins remaining: Essendon 12-11 (83) vs Richmond 12-9 (81) Aarts misses a shot that he might have kicked and then Stringer follows suit at the other end of the ground, missing the lot for no score. Q4: 12 mins remaining: Essendon 12-11 (83) vs Richmond 12-9 (81) Essendon goal! The Bombers are in front! Up and about, they work the ball forward by sheer force of will and get the ball over the top to Waterman, who crumbs the ball off the pack and dribbles one through for a big, big goal. Humungous turn of events. Q4: 13 mins remaining: Essendon 11-11 (77) vs Richmond 12-8 (80) Essendon goal! The Dons get three in no time at all as Tippa again makes his presence felt to help set jup Langford, who drills his set shot to make it a three-point ball game. Momentum is with Essendon. And momentum is everything. Q4: 14 mins remaining: Essendon 10-11 (71) vs Richmond 12-8 (80) Essendon goal! Costly, very costly for Richmond, who give away a free kick well away from the ball and Hooker does the rest, holding his nerve from almost 50 metres out to get the Bombers to within nine points. Q4: 15 mins remaining: Essendon 9-11 (65) vs Richmond 12-8 (80) Stringer marks deep in attack but instead of having a checkside with his left he palms off to Watermna, who fingertips a mark but misses his set shot. Q4: 16 mins remaining: Essendon 9-10 (64) vs Richmond 12-8 (80) Essendon goal! Tippa and Parish are instrumental in working away from a stoppage before a chain of passes finds its way to Hooker, who marks in the square and makes no mistake from right in front. Hmmm. Game on. Q4: 19 mins remaining: Essendon 8-10 (58) vs Richmond 12-8 (80) The Tigers clear the ball with ease from the centre and Riewoldt looks set to put more space on the Bombers but his set shot is tepid. Doesn’t even make the distance. The Bombers keep coming but the Tigers keep repelling. That was the story of the third quarter and, frankly, the story of the match. Essendon are not out of it but Richmond don’t look like loosening their grip anytime soon. Q3: 1 min remaining: Essendon 8-10 (58) vs Richmond 12-8 (80) Richmond goal! Oh dear. Martin unmarked 20 metres out from goal = a goal. The Bombers might have gone into 3QT with some hope. That hope now looks diminished. Telling show of strength and class by the Tigers to close the quarter. Q3: 1 min remaining: Essendon 8-10 (58) vs Richmond 11-8 (74) Essendon goal! Stringer!!!! The Package delivers, using his speed to get some time and space before snapping delightfully from 45 metres out. They just won’t lie down, the Bombers. Gutsy stuff. Q3: 2 mins remaining: Essendon 7-9 (54) vs Richmond 11-8 (74) Essendon goal! The Bombers get one back as Cox is shoved square in the back in front of goal before kicking truly to give men in red-and-black belief that maybe, just maybe, hope is not yet lost. Q3: 3 mins remaining: Essendon 6-9 (45) vs Richmond 11-8 (74) Richmond goal! Cruel for the Bombers as Richmond transition venomously from defence with Graham drilling a nail into the coffin with a confident finish. Starting to get out of hand for the Bombers, who have been brave but are now looking outclassed. Q3: 5 mins remaining: Essendon 6-8 (44) vs Richmond 10-8 (68) Parish zeroes in on goal and it looks like he can’t miss, but that is precisely what he does: miss. The Bombers need scores of six, not one. Q3: 6 mins remaining: Essendon 6-7 (43) vs Richmond 10-8 (68) Richmond goal! Grimes gets dispossessed deep in defence - how was that not holding the ball?????? - and Essendon are denied what should be theirs: a shot on goal. The ball slings to the other end and Castagna, somehow afforded time and space close to goal, finishes off in a cruel blow to the Bombers. Twelve-point play. Don’t want to bash the umps, but that was awful umpiring. Q3: 9 mins remaining: Essendon 6-6 (42) vs Richmond 9-8 (62) Richmond goal! The Bombers aren’t clean out of defence and they turn the ball over just where they don’t want to: in the path of Bolton, who reads the ball off the pack and splits the big sticks from close range. That stings for Essendon. Q3: 11 mins remaining: Essendon 6-5 (41) vs Richmond 8-8 (56) Cotchin coughs up possession with a poor kick inside before Zaharakis takes over and sets up Phillips but he squanders his chance to get the Bombers within two kicks of the Tigers, missing to the left what he really should have kicked. Q3: 14 mins remaining: Essendon 6-4 (40) vs Richmond 8-8 (56) Essendon goal! Lightning fast work from Mc-T in the middle of the ground opens up Richmond’s zone and Zaharakis is involved to set up Ham, who drills his shot on the run to put Essendon right in this contest. Q3: 16 mins remaining: Essendon 5-4 (34) vs Richmond 8-8 (56) Dusty almost pouches an extremely tough half-chance deep in attack but the ball spills free and Essendon collect the crumbs to work their way out of danger. Q3: 19 mins remaining: Essendon 5-4 (34) vs Richmond 8-8 (56) And we are back. Richmond clear away from the centre and Laverde, under heavy pressure from Martin, punches the ball through for a rushed behind. Richmond maintain their ascendancy but Essendon’s commitment was better in that second term. Though the Tigers extended their 19-point quarter-time lead to 21 at the main break, the Bombers look to be more in the contest than they were in the opening stanza. They started getting their hands on it in the middle of the park and were far more direct in their forward advances. It’s still Richmond’s to lose but Essendon are not out of this by any stretch. Q2: 1 min remaining: Essendon 5-4 (34) vs Richmond 8-7 (55) Essendon goal! The Bombers pressure Richmond into a turnover and Ham makes another good fist of it, getting on the end of a handpass receive and kicking truly on the run. They won’t go away, the Dons. Q2: 2 mins remaining: Essendon 4-3 (27) vs Richmond 8-7 (55) Coleman-Jones is awarded a holding free but can’t make the Dons pay, missing his chance to kick three goals inside the first half. Q2: 4 mins remaining: Essendon 4-3 (27) vs Richmond 8-6 (54) Richmond goal! Waterman spills what he should have taken and Richmond cash in as Graham converts from close range. The closer the Bombers get, the further away the Tigers go. Q2: 6 mins remaining: Essendon 4-3 (27) vs Richmond 7-6 (48) Essendon goal! And now a quick reply from the Bombers after a centre victory of their own, Waterman doing the rest with a deft finish. Q2: 7 mins remaining: Essendon 3-3 (21) vs Richmond 7-6 (48) Richmond goal! Quick reply from the Tigers and it again comes from a centre clearance. Bombers defenders can’t do anything to mop up as Caddy spins, dodges and shakes - confusing everybody, including possibly himself - before snapping a goal with his left boot. Q2: 9 mins remaining: Essendon 3-3 (21) vs Richmond 6-6 (42) Essendon goal! Riewoldt coughs up a 50-metre penalty in Richmond’s back half and it’s a costly error as Phillips, who outmuscles Pickett in a marking contest before converting nicely. They needed that, the Bombers. Q2: 10 mins remaining: Essendon 2-3 (15) vs Richmond 6-5 (41) Richmond goal! Another for Riewoldt and six for Richmond and Jumping Jack rocks back from about 50 out and bisects the middle. Huge tackle from Aarts, and repeat involvement from Houli, set it all up. Q2: 12 mins remaining: Essendon 2-3 (15) vs Richmond 5-5 (35) McGrath looks done for the night with a knee injury. Big blow for the Bombers. Cox takes a well-judged mark, cops one late from Vlastuin for his troubles, but can’t finish the job as his set shot misses to the left. At the other end, and boy did the ball move fast, Riewoldt hits the post with a left-foot snap. Q2: 16 mins remaining: Essendon 2-2 (14) vs Richmond 5-4 (34) Richmond goal! Fast break by the Tigers and a searching ball to a dangerous spot is gobbled up by Coleman-Jones, who seals the deal with an assured finish. Q2: 17 mins remaining: Essendon 2-2 (14) vs Richmond 4-4 (28) Essendon goal! The Bombers rebound and they catch the Tiges unawares with some swift ball movement as Hooker fairly well outmarks three defenders before splitting the big sticks in a much-needed goal. There are already 55,000 people in the stadium. Biggest crowd of the year at Optus. Q2: 19 mins remaining: Essendon 1-2 (8) vs Richmond 4-4 (28) Michael Long just got interviewed on the telly. We are not worthy. The Tigers look set to start with another goal but a timely touch on the line makes it only a sixth as bad. All Richmond, really. The Tigers dominated possession in the first quarter and that led to a glut of inside-50s. The weight of numbers told in the end and Essendon have some work to do. Q1: 1 min remaining: Essendon 1-2 (8) vs Richmond 4-3 (27) Richmond goal! Mc-T has a bit of a fumble in the middle of the ground, but Chol then matches him, and the quarter looks to be petering out before a chaos ball inside 50 hits the chest of Riewoldt, who rocks back and converts. Big first quarter from Richmond. Q1: 2 mins remaining: Essendon 1-2 (8) vs Richmond 3-3 (21) Laverde’s rushed kick forward is snaffled by Chol, who is having one heck of a quarter - maybe he is a first-choice ruckman - but his disposal lets him down and Essendon have a chance to reboot. Lovely looking set shot from Parish almost on the boundary but it fades to the right. Q1: 5 mins remaining: Essendon 1-1 (7) vs Richmond 3-3 (21) Richmond goal! The Tigers are cutting Essendon to shreds in the middle - far too easy in the corridor - and Castagna slots one home after marking, unmarked if you don’t mind, 35 metres out from goal directly in front. Q1: 8 mins remaining: Essendon 1-1 (7) vs Richmond 2-2 (14) Essendon goal! The Bombers are away as Ham gets a slice of the action, marking strongly inside 50 and Ham-mering it home with an assured kick from (free) range. Just as well he didn’t shave the post and instead put it through the middle. Q1: 10 mins remaining: Essendon 0-1 (1) vs Richmond 2-2 (14) The Bombers get the ball not only inside 50 but onto the chest of a leading forward. Jones has a good chance to kickstart his team’s night but it’s a horrible shank that still manages to register a behind. By the by, Martin has changed his boots. Bigger moulds? Q1: 12 mins remaining: Essendon 0-0 (0) vs Richmond 2-2 (14) Richmond goal! Chol finds himself with time and space at centre half-forward - he’s off to a blinder - and a pinpoint pass finds Martin, who does what Martin does. The rest. Big start by the Tiges. Q1: 14 mins remaining: Essendon 0-0 (0) vs Richmond 1-2 (8) Ripping tackle by Redman on Aarts saves Essendon’s bacon in the right forward pocket. The Dons might want to start possessing the ball, however! Q1: 15 mins remaining: Essendon 0-0 (0) vs Richmond 1-2 (8) Richmond Goal! Coleman-Jones gets manhandled in the square and it’s an easy conversion from there. First goal of the game. All Richmond so far. Killing it in the middle and Essendon can’t get their hands on it. Q1: 17 mins remaining: Essendon 0-0 (0) vs Richmond 0-2 (2) Dusty gets his hands on it in the centre and he finds Riewoldt on the chest - how many times have we seen that?! - but the entry inside-50 is a bit off and it’s anyone’s ball before Prestia has a rushed snap that misses to the left. Q1: 19 mins remaining: Essendon 0-0 (0) vs Richmond 0-1 (1) And we are away. Straight out of the middle by Richmond and Chol goes long. Could’ve been a goal in about as many seconds but he misses to the right. TWELVE snags!!!!!!!!! The Crows have been fined a hefty amount - hefty in the sense that it will come from their football department soft cap - for what can only be described as an act of rank stupidity. 100% The Dons haven’t beaten Richmond since round 11, 2014. If you don’t think that was a long time ago, take a look at how young some of these gents look. In a game with fewer players. So an enormous ratio! It’s a sensational day in Perth. Prime conditions for a long walk and a great game of footy. The annual Dreamtime fixture really is a beaut. It’s something lovers of this great game should cherish.

Belmont health centre in Stanmore, Harrow, is open on Saturday to over-18s who are still waiting for their first vaccine and who live or work in Harrow. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is being administered all day at the walk-in clinic and people do not need to be registered with the practice to get their vaccine. National eligibility criteria in England states that only those aged 30 and over are invited for their first jab, and it is understood that health officials want to prioritise that cohort in Harrow rather than younger age groups, PA news reports. But the poster advertising the walk-in centre clearly states that people aged 18 and over can come along, and the majority of people waiting appear to be in their 20s. By mid-morning, a huge queue had formed in the area of the health centre, with the line snaking around a car park and stretching down the street. Among them were 20-year-old students Jamie Lesser and Daniel Simmons who arrived at around 8.15am. Lesser said it will be a relief to get the jab, telling the PA news agency: “If all plans go ahead, clubs are going to open in three weeks’ time and we both have plans to go out.” He said he has clubbing plans for “about five days in a row” if nightclubs open, “making up for the last year and a half”. Lesser said he found out about Saturday’s walk-in through friends in a group chat who had forwarded on information about it. He said: To be honest we weren’t intending to give up the whole of the Saturday. We were going to go to the gym fairly early … Thought we’d get here very early to avoid the queue, which hasn’t been very successful. Simmons said that as soon as he saw the chance to get the jab, he thought he would “jump on it”, adding: “I want to get it as soon as possible really.” Queueing for his jab, Chand Shah, a 25-year-old accountant, said the walk-in centre was “heavily advertised” and he thought it was a “good idea” to get the vaccine ahead of the possible further easing of restrictions on June 21. Asked if he expected to get his vaccine so soon, he said: “No. I was expecting August to be honest.” Shah added: “I think if you get the vaccine you feel safer.” South Korea’s respect for intellectual property rights makes it an ideal partner for the United States as it seeks to decouple its supply chains from China and forge partnerships to manufacture coronavirus vaccines, a trio of US senators said on Saturday during a visit to Seoul. The Democrat senators Tammy Duckworth and Chris Coons, and the Republican senator Dan Sullivan, were in South Korea as part of their first official overseas trip since the pandemic began. After last month’s summit in Washington between US President Joe Biden and South Korean President Moon Jae-in – who was only the second international leader to be welcomed by Biden – the senators said their visit was sign of the importance Washington places on South Korea’s role in countering China and shoring up global supply chains amid the pandemic. Duckworth told a group of reporters: We can trust in the legal system here, and we can trust that our intellectual property rights will be protected. South Korea is a logical partner. This is critical whether it is manufacturing [computer] chips or pharmaceuticals. A day after Biden and Moon met, the US drugmakers Moderna Inc and Novavax Inc entered a deal with South Korea for its Covid-19 vaccines to be manufactured in the country, which has been seeking to secure more and faster deliveries of US-made vaccines. Here’s a brief summary of the major recent developments: Going ahead with the UK’s planned reopening on 21 June would be “foolish” and a “major risk”, an expert on an advisory group to the UK government warned. Prof Stephen Reicher said there was enough evidence to say that one of the government’s four key tests for its road map out of lockdown has not been met. India recorded 120,529 new cases in 24 hours as its capital, New Delhi, undertook a partial easing of its lockdown. The city was preparing to deal with an infection peak of 37,000 cases a day, its chief minister said. Covid-19 policies risk leaving psychological and socioeconomic scars on millions of young people across Europe, with far-reaching consequences for them and society, a wide-ranging Guardian project has revealed. Taking a snapshot, the Guardian asked five members of Europe’s Generation Z how the worst global pandemic in a century has affected their lives, what they have learned and how they see their future after the pandemic. The boss of Airlines UK has complained about a lack of transparency and consistency in the government’s changes to travel rules. Tim Alderslade, the chief executive of the industry body that represents UK carriers, said ministers had not kept to promises over a “green watchlist” that would have given travellers increased warning about a country potentially coming off the safe list. His comments came after the government decided to move Portugal out of the green list and into the amber travel category. It means people arriving in the UK from Portugal after 4am on Tuesday will need to self-isolate at home for 10 days in a change that has left holidaymakers scrambling for expensive return flights in a bid to beat the quarantine deadline. Speaking about the “green watchlist” proposal, Alderslade told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: It would be a list of countries that were on the cusp, [where] there was a risk that they would be moving from green to amber, so passengers were aware of that, it was fully transparent and they would be taking that risk when they booked. It was entirely to stop what happened last summer when countries were moving up and down off the corridor list on a weekly basis and we saw people stranded overseas and then desperate to come home again because they couldn’t afford to quarantine. It has caused complete pandemonium because we don’t have that watchlist that we were promised by the government and I think with the taskforce, the transparency is not there, we don’t know what has to happen for countries to move from green to amber, or amber to green for that matter. Everyone aged older than 12 years in specific postcode areas of the English county of Berkshire will be offered PCR testing over the next two weeks from Monday in an effort to tackle the spread of the Delta variant. Meradin Peachey, the director of public health for Berkshire West, said a “real concern” with this variant is that if it keeps circulating there may be more mutations. She told BBC Breakfast: What’s happened in the last couple of weeks, especially in the last week, we’ve noticed that a lot of cases now coming through we can’t link to any travellers, which means we now have community transmission. She said cases are mainly among young people, with “virtually nobody over 60 or anyone who has been vaccinated” affected. She added: If the variant spreads and becomes even more, it may mutate again and the big concern is that vaccines won’t work. We really want to get people tested and isolated if they’ve got the virus, stop the spread so that we can make sure the vaccination programme works. Earlier, Dr Mike Tildesley, a member of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (Spi-M) UK government advisory panel, said ministers had a “difficult call” to make. He told Times Radio: It’s a hard one. I’m going to be annoying and sit a little bit on the fence on this, as I don’t think it’s our role as epidemiologists to call that. I think the difficult thing that we have, the difficult situation the government have, is of course if you delay that then of course you’ll get a smaller subsequent wave. I mean, that’s the case with any control policy – if you leave them in for a longer period of time then it’s going to reduce cases. But, of course, if you delay that we know that negatively impacts businesses, people’s livelihoods, and so forth. So, this is the difficult call that they have to make, and all we can do is put together as much evidence as possible and say this is what we expect to happen if you relax on 21 June, this is what we may expect if you delay that by two weeks for example, or four weeks and so on, so they have all the evidence they can to make the decision. It is clear that it would be “foolish” and a “major risk” to go ahead with the 21 June reopening, an expert on an advisory group to the UK government has said. Prof Stephen Reicher said there was enough evidence to say one of the government’s four key tests for its roadmap out of lockdown had not been met, according to the PA news agency. The member of the Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours (Spi-B), which advises the government, said the criteria about the current assessment of the risks not being fundamentally changed by new variants of concern was “not upheld” due to the spread of the Delta variant. Reicher told the news agency: I think, by the government’s own criteria, it’s quite clear that it would be foolish to proceed on the data that we’ve got at the moment. The risk would be very great indeed. And of course it’s a balance of risks but I think it would be a major risk to go further in opening up. Again, I make the point that it is about data not dates, and if you make it too much about the dates then you box yourself into a corner and I think that’s what the government has done. Marton Aszalos, a Hungarian paramedic, and Eniko Tokacs-Mathe, a vet, had to cancel their wedding twice during the pandemic and are finally getting ready for their big day this summer as restrictions are lifted. Reuters reports that the couple, who met in 2016 at a clinic where Eniko was working and Marton was then a trainee, say the emotional rollercoaster of the past 18 months has been draining but has made their relationship stronger. Eniko told the news agency: Because of the pandemic, we had to replan our wedding for the third time; both its date and the venue. The pandemic has also had a serious mental and physical affect on my fiancé as he is an ambulance officer. Reuters reports that the couple held a civil ceremony a month ago and are preparing for a wedding party with more than 100 guests in the town of Makó, near the Romanian border. Eniko is from Transylvania and many of her relatives will cross to Hungary to attend. They have been rehearsing their waltz for the wedding night, after a photo shoot on a motor boat on the Danube. Eniko said: Before, I thought my main worries would be whether we manage the lift in the dance, whether my makeup and hair would look good. But now, I am just happy and hope that all the guests and relatives can make it in health and we can celebrate together. Many couples are relieved that with 53% of Hungarians vaccinated, they can now go ahead and get married, Reuters reports. Gabor Herendi, a wedding planner, usually handles 30 to 35 weddings a year. But, in 2020, about 70% were postponed to this year. After the long wait, “energies will be multiplied”, he said. Hawaii will drop its quarantine and testing requirements for travellers once 70% of the state’s population has been vaccinated, the Associated Press reports, citing the governor, David Ige. The state will also lift its requirement that people wear masks indoors once that level has been reached. The state health department website said 59% of Hawaii’s population had had at least one dose of a vaccine and 52% had finished their dosing regimen. The AP reports: The state is using its figures, and not those provided by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to calculate thresholds for lifting restrictions. The health department director, Dr Libby Char, said that’s because Hawaii’s numbers are more accurate. She said it appeared the CDC had been counting some of Hawaii’s doses twice. Right now, travellers arriving from out of state must spend 10 days in quarantine or, to bypass that quarantine, they must show proof of a negative test taken before departure for the islands. Once 60% of Hawaii’s population is vaccinated, Ige said, the state will allow travellers to bypass a quarantine requirement as long as they can prove they were vaccinated in the US. Restrictions on travel between the islands will open up before that. Ige said that as of 15 June, people will be able to fly inter-island without taking a test or showing proof of vaccination. Also on that date, those who have been vaccinated in Hawaii may bypass quarantine when returning from a trip out of state. Russia has reported 9,145 new cases, including 2,897 in Moscow, taking the official national tally since the pandemic began to 5,117,274. According to Reuters, the government’s taskforce said 399 people had died in the past 24 hours, pushing the national death toll to 123,436. Taiwan has reported 511 new domestic cases, including 35 cases added to totals for recent days. That is up from the 472 domestic infections reported on Friday, Reuters reports. The agency also reports that Taiwan is in talks with US companies about making their vaccines, following similar talks with European firms, citing the health minister Chen Shih-chung. Taiwan, like much of the world, has been trying to speed up its vaccination programme following a spike in domestic cases, but has been stymied by global supply shortages. Chen told reporters that they previously had talks with European companies he did not name about producing their vaccines under licence. “Only recently have we started to have talks with US companies to see if it’s possible or not to carry out relevant subcontracting work,” he added, without providing details. Taiwan has ordered around 5m shots from the US firm Moderna, of which 150,000 have arrived. It has ordered 10m shots from the British-Swedish firm AstraZeneca. Taiwan, also in talks with BioNTech, blames China – which claims the island as its own territory – for blocking a deal with the German company earlier this year. Johnson &amp; Johnson said on Friday it had been in talks with Taiwan about providing its vaccine since last year. The number of confirmed cases in Germany increased by 2,294 to 3,697,927, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) shows, while the reported death toll has risen by 122 to 89,148. Mexico recorded 206 more deaths on Friday, bringing the total death toll to 228,568, its health ministry has said. Separate government data recently published suggests the real death toll may be at least 60% above the confirmed figure, Reuters has reported. Victoria, Australia’s second most populous state, has reported a small increase in locally acquired cases, as authorities hunt for the source of a new cluster of a highly infectious variant. Reuters reports: Five new local cases were reported, taking Victoria’s total to 70 in the latest outbreak, as the state capital, Melbourne, entered its second weekend of a hard lockdown, due to end on 10 June. Curbs were eased for the rest of the state on Friday. Saturday’s count was up from four new locally acquired cases on Friday. Authorities were alarmed after detecting the highly infectious Delta variant for the first time in Melbourne, sparking concerns cases could surge. There are now seven known cases in the city. The Delta variant, which has been classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as among the four variants of concern due to evidence that it spreads more easily, probably caused the latest devastating outbreak in India. Snap lockdowns, regional border restrictions and strict social distancing rules have helped Australia rein in prior outbreaks and keep its numbers relatively low at just 30,150 cases and 910 deaths. Victoria’s outbreak, which began on 24 May, has spurred people to join long queues for vaccinations following a slow rollout since February. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, said 20% of the adult population had now had a first dose of a vaccine. India’s capital city is preparing to deal with an infection peak of 37,000 cases a day in future, its chief minister has said, as the country as a whole reports 120,529 new cases over the last 24 hours. According to the Reuters agency, New Delhi’s political leader Arvind Kejriwal announced a partial easing of a lockdown, while the city is also preparing for oxygen storage capacity of 420 tons, and will set up genome sequencing labs to study coronavirus variants. Citing the federal health ministry, the agency reported 3,380 more deaths across India in 24 hours and said the tally of infections stood at 28.69 million and the death toll at 344,082.","charCount":"16654","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/nicola-slawson\">Nicola Slawson</a>(now) and <a href=\"profile/kevin-rawlinson\">Kevin Rawlinson</a>(earlier)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"games/2021/jun/05/powerwash-simulator-knockout-city-review-let-us-spray","type":"article","sectionId":"games","sectionName":"Games","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-05T12:00:09Z","webTitle":"PowerWash Simulator;  Knockout City review – let us spray","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2021/jun/05/powerwash-simulator-knockout-city-review-let-us-spray","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/games/2021/jun/05/powerwash-simulator-knockout-city-review-let-us-spray","fields":{"headline":"PowerWash Simulator;  Knockout City review – let us spray","standfirst":"<p><strong>FuturLab; Windows/Velan; various platforms</strong><br>There’s sublime fun in jet-cleaning a town, and a dodgeball-themed knockout contest has one eye on the Olympics</p>","trailText":"There’s sublime fun in jet-cleaning a town, and a dodgeball-themed knockout contest has one eye on the Olympics","byline":"Simon Parkin","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7488452824665e076607df04a2700645a9c37b72\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7488452824665e076607df04a2700645a9c37b72/48_0_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"PowerWash Simulator\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Good clean fun: PowerWash Simulator</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: FuturLab</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>A few years ago, on a disorientatingly out-of-character whim, I hired an industrial jet-wash. What, precisely, I needed to clean so urgently, or indeed so extravagantly, now escapes me but the experience left an indelible impression. I can still feel the forceful pushback of the stream, the pizza-slice-shaped splay of the jet, and the delicious way the sweep of high-speed water left a pristine swipe on the patio stone. Everything the jet-wash touched was brightly restored, as if the stream contained not mere water, but a kind of time-travel serum. I had the machine for the entire weekend, and became absolutely carried away, until I was sweeping Yangtzes of filthy run-off water into the road, my clothes covered in decades of loosened sediment. I felt unduly proud of my restorative busywork until a pair of teenagers passed. Nodding in my direction, one remarked to the other: “Now <em>that</em> is a shit job.”</p> <p>Joke’s on you, I thought:<em> this isn’t my actual job</em>. Unfortunately, writing about video games <em>is</em> my actual job: enter <strong><a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1290000/PowerWash_Simulator/\">PowerWash Simulator</a></strong>, a game in which you use an industrial jet-wash to clean your town. It’s all pleasingly straightforward: here’s a filthy thing, wash it. Your first specimen is a mucky van that, once restored, provides transport to new jobs. You have a variety of nozzles (from the weakly sweeping to the laser-focused), and you’re free to wander around the vehicle, squat the better to dig into the cracks and crevices, and position a stepladder.</p> <p>Each discrete part of the vehicle – a tyre, a window, a bumper – flashes when it’s fully cleaned, and the final ping when the work is complete is utterly satisfying. You soon move from the manageable to the daunting: an entire backyard situated, presumably, close to a gobbing Vesuvius. With every surface smothered in grime, the diffuse focus makes the task feel less like a zen-like expunging, but the appeal is broadly undiminished.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unvuuweAW_w\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/unvuuweAW_w?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unvuuweAW_w\">Watch a trailer for PowerWash Simulator</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p><em>PowerWash Simulator</em> is currently in early access (you pay a reduced premium to play a game not yet finished), but even now this is an irresistible example of so-called “playbour”, and further evidence that a shit job often makes for a sublime game.</p> <p>There have been dodgeball-themed video games before, but none infused with the comic-book physicality of <strong><a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1301210/Knockout_City/\">Knockout City</a></strong>, a competitive online game backed by the makers of <em>Fifa</em>.

What, precisely, I needed to clean so urgently, or indeed so extravagantly, now escapes me but the experience left an indelible impression. I can still feel the forceful pushback of the stream, the pizza-slice-shaped splay of the jet, and the delicious way the sweep of high-speed water left a pristine swipe on the patio stone. Everything the jet-wash touched was brightly restored, as if the stream contained not mere water, but a kind of time-travel serum. I had the machine for the entire weekend, and became absolutely carried away, until I was sweeping Yangtzes of filthy run-off water into the road, my clothes covered in decades of loosened sediment. I felt unduly proud of my restorative busywork until a pair of teenagers passed. Nodding in my direction, one remarked to the other: “Now that is a shit job.” Joke’s on you, I thought: this isn’t my actual job. Unfortunately, writing about video games is my actual job: enter PowerWash Simulator, a game in which you use an industrial jet-wash to clean your town. It’s all pleasingly straightforward: here’s a filthy thing, wash it. Your first specimen is a mucky van that, once restored, provides transport to new jobs. You have a variety of nozzles (from the weakly sweeping to the laser-focused), and you’re free to wander around the vehicle, squat the better to dig into the cracks and crevices, and position a stepladder. Each discrete part of the vehicle – a tyre, a window, a bumper – flashes when it’s fully cleaned, and the final ping when the work is complete is utterly satisfying. You soon move from the manageable to the daunting: an entire backyard situated, presumably, close to a gobbing Vesuvius. With every surface smothered in grime, the diffuse focus makes the task feel less like a zen-like expunging, but the appeal is broadly undiminished. PowerWash Simulator is currently in early access (you pay a reduced premium to play a game not yet finished), but even now this is an irresistible example of so-called “playbour”, and further evidence that a shit job often makes for a sublime game. There have been dodgeball-themed video games before, but none infused with the comic-book physicality of Knockout City, a competitive online game backed by the makers of Fifa. Played in a series of high-rise arenas, two teams of three hurl a variety of futuristic-looking projectiles at one another in an effort to strike their opponents’ bodies, while catching or dodging any incoming balls. Two strikes on one player and your team loses a point. First to 10 wins the round. With air-dashes, balletic pirouettes and the ability to curl yourself into a ball for a teammate to hurl, this is a long throw from the official sport that hopes, one day, to enter the Olympics. Games are just as taut and competitive, however, with lots of scope for showboating. No competitive online game in 2021 can be merely a competitive online game, however, and, like Fortnite et al, Knockout City has an entire superstructure of unlockable items and progress meters, with an eye to turning the game into an enduring entertainment platform. Whether or not it hits that elusive target, beneath the capitalist carapace this is wonderful game-making.

South East Stars also face Western Storm at the Oval, and it is Southern Vipers versus Central Sparks at Hove in a clash between the only two unbeaten teams so far.","charCount":"6682","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/graham-hardcastle\">Graham Hardcastle</a> at Headingley"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/live/2021/jun/05/derby-day-at-epsom-2021-live-horse-racing","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-05T11:51:16Z","webTitle":"Derby day at Epsom 2021 – live!","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2021/jun/05/derby-day-at-epsom-2021-live-horse-racing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2021/jun/05/derby-day-at-epsom-2021-live-horse-racing","fields":{"headline":"Derby day at Epsom 2021 – live!","standfirst":"<ul><li>Latest news and updates with The Derby at 4.30pm BST</li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2021/jun/05/talking-horses-hurricane-lane-can-blow-rest-of-field-away-in-derby-horse-racing-tips\">Talking Horses: Greg Wood’s tips for Saturday’s racing</a><br></li><li>And feel free <a href=\"mailto:tony.paley@theguardian.com\">to email Tony</a>, or tweet <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tonypaley\">@tonypaley</a></li></ul>","trailText":"Follow all the action as the famous race is staged for a 242nd time at Epsom","byline":"Tony Paley, with Greg Wood at Epsom","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f031486cc08a2d0507993c7e2a96e5cde3b6ae0c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f031486cc08a2d0507993c7e2a96e5cde3b6ae0c/0_163_6000_3603/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Spectators arrive for day two of the Derby Festival.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spectators arrive for day two of the Derby Festival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<div id=\"block-60bb60cc8f08b9889b369b56\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-05T11:42:38.991Z\">12.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Some of you will be having a go at the ITV7 or backing in other races at Epsom.

Kulusevski has made steady progress in his first full season at Juventus and was the hero of their Coppa Italia victory over his former club Atalanta. Having moved to Italy three months after his 16th birthday, the forward spent two spells at Parma and joined Juve for more than £30m last year. Kulusevki, whose father is from North Macedonia, was born in Sweden but represented Macedonia at under 16 and 17 level before making the switch and is often compared to Zlatan Ibrahimovic in his homeland. “He can do things by himself and can decide a game by himself,” said former England manager Sven Goran Eriksson last year. “Sweden need that and have always had that but right now we don’t.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2021/06/euros-players/embed/Sweden/21/player.html\" data-alt=\"Dejan Kulusevski\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2021/06/euros-players/embed/Sweden/21/player.html\">Dejan Kulusevski</a> </figure>  <h2>Jules Koundé, France</h2> <p>In a squad that could afford to lose Manchester City’s Aymeric Laporte to Spain given the existing quality of centre-backs available to Didier Deschamps, the 22-year-old’s first senior call-up could prove to be significant. Koundé – who also qualifies for Benin through his father – has been outstanding for Sevilla since moving to Spain from Bordeaux in 2019 and is expected to move on this summer for a fee in excess of £50m, with Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United among his many admirers. While Deschamps is likely to start with his tried and tested players in France’s opener against Germany, Koundé is an excellent alternative if required. At just 5ft 10, he is unusually short for a central defender but more than makes up for that with his reading of the game. “For me, height is not just a matter of centimetres,” he says. “The most important thing is to play smart.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2021/06/euros-players/embed/France/25/player.html\" data-alt=\"Jules Koundé\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2021/06/euros-players/embed/France/25/player.html\">Jules Koundé</a> </figure>  <h2>Pedri, Spain</h2> <p>The player who fittingly provided the backheel for Lionel Messi to score his record 644th goal for Barcelona – beating Pele’s all-time mark for a single team – in December is making rapid progress towards one day potentially inheriting the Argentina forward’s crown at Camp Nou. Signed for an initial €4m from Las Palmas last summer, where he became the club’s youngest goalscorer at 16 years nine months, Pedri is the first player since Arturo Vidal and Ivan Rakitic in 2014, to play more than 50 games in their first season at Barça and received his first senior cap in March.

Kulusevski has made steady progress in his first full season at Juventus and was the hero of their Coppa Italia victory over his former club Atalanta. Having moved to Italy three months after his 16th birthday, the forward spent two spells at Parma and joined Juve for more than £30m last year. Kulusevki, whose father is from North Macedonia, was born in Sweden but represented Macedonia at under 16 and 17 level before making the switch and is often compared to Zlatan Ibrahimovic in his homeland. “He can do things by himself and can decide a game by himself,” said former England manager Sven Goran Eriksson last year. “Sweden need that and have always had that but right now we don’t.” Jules Koundé, France In a squad that could afford to lose Manchester City’s Aymeric Laporte to Spain given the existing quality of centre-backs available to Didier Deschamps, the 22-year-old’s first senior call-up could prove to be significant. Koundé – who also qualifies for Benin through his father – has been outstanding for Sevilla since moving to Spain from Bordeaux in 2019 and is expected to move on this summer for a fee in excess of £50m, with Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United among his many admirers. While Deschamps is likely to start with his tried and tested players in France’s opener against Germany, Koundé is an excellent alternative if required. At just 5ft 10, he is unusually short for a central defender but more than makes up for that with his reading of the game. “For me, height is not just a matter of centimetres,” he says. “The most important thing is to play smart.” Pedri, Spain The player who fittingly provided the backheel for Lionel Messi to score his record 644th goal for Barcelona – beating Pele’s all-time mark for a single team – in December is making rapid progress towards one day potentially inheriting the Argentina forward’s crown at Camp Nou. Signed for an initial €4m from Las Palmas last summer, where he became the club’s youngest goalscorer at 16 years nine months, Pedri is the first player since Arturo Vidal and Ivan Rakitic in 2014, to play more than 50 games in their first season at Barça and received his first senior cap in March. Having only turned 18 last year, such is the midfielder’s growing importance to both club and country that he was allowed to miss the last game of the season against Eibar and go on holiday to make sure that he is ready for the Euros. “Pedri already does wonderful things despite his age,” says manager Luis Enrique. “He is humble, intelligent and a hard worker. What I see is a top-level player.” Ryan Gravenberch, Netherlands Gravenberch became the youngest debutant in Ajax history, beating Clarence Seedorf’s 27-year-old record in September 2018 but has had to wait until the last 12 months to fulfil some of his vast potential.

It was 1954, and the Canadian government had decided he was to be sent to a residential school in Ontario – hundreds of kilometers from his Indigenous community in Quebec. “He was just a child, a gentle child born on the land of his ancestors,” his brother Romeo recalled this week. Just a year after arriving at the school, Jonnish contracted rheumatic fever and died far from his family. He was buried in an unmarked grave near the school. Last week, news broke at the other end of the country that would bring all those painful memories back. It was “devastating – again,” said Romeo. Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc, an Indigenous nation in British Columbia, announced they had uncovered evidence of unmarked graves containing the remains of as many as 215 Indigenous children behind the site of a former residential school in the city of Kamloops. “To our knowledge, these missing children are undocumented deaths,” said Kúkpi7 (chief) Rosanne Casimir in a statement. “Some were as young as three.” The news came as a shock to many Canadians, but it shouldn’t have. Indigenous people, especially those who survived the schools, have known for years that unmarked graves of their relatives dot the country. And Canada, they have said, is doing precious little about it. The news from Kamloops has had Saganash thinking about those friends he lost in the 10 years he spent at La Tuque Indian residential school in Quebec. “Those who disappeared or never made it home, those I knew were abused physically, sexually, spiritually,” Saganash wrote in an email. “Their eyes and look flashed in my memory, the things they said to me without uttering a word. The cries for help without tears. Those memories will stay with me all my life.” Between 1867 and 1996, the Canadian state abducted more than 150,000 Indigenous children from their parents and forced them into these schools as part of a campaign of forced assimilation. Thousands were subject to physical, emotional and sexual abuse. According to the official register, 3,213 died. The real number is certainly much higher. For decades, the mortality rate for Indigenous children in these schools ranged between twice as high and five times higher than non-Indigenous schoolchildren. Suicide, neglect and disease all contributed to the devastating loss of life. Roughly 900 students died of tuberculosis in the schools. More than 150 would die of influenza and a similar number of pneumonia . In hundreds of other cases, a cause of death is unknown. During the 1918 influenza pandemic, the principal of one Alberta school wrote in a letter to the department: “We have no isolation ward and no hospital equipment of any kind. The dead, the dying, and the sick and the convalescent were all together.” He called the conditions “criminal”. Memories remain vivid for many survivors. Shirley Leon recalled seeing cattle trucks driving on to her reserve as a child – and then “seeing my cousins cry and then they were put on these trucks, and hauled off – we didn’t know where”, she told an inquiry decades later. Soon, the government would come for her, too: she attended the Kamloops school in the 1940s. Some schools were government-run; others were administered by the church. All shared one central mission. One official wrote in 1910 that those schools were “geared towards the final solution of our Indian Problem”. In practice, that meant stripping Indigenous students of their culture, language – and everything that made them Indigenous. There is another name for that program: a Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which spent five years hearing the stories of survivors from those schools, described it as “cultural genocide”. Another witness, Ray Silver, told the commission about his time at the Alberni Indian residential school, in British Columbia. His brother, Dalton, fell ill, but Silver was not told. “He was a little guy, lying in the bed in the infirmary, dying, and I didn’t know ’til he died.” The commission’s report was published in 2015 to great fanfare, and came accompanied by 94 calls to action – steps Canada must take in order to reckon with its ugly past and do right by the 1.7 million Indigenous people in the country, who consistently see lower health, education and economic outcomes. The commission also identified 20 unmarked gravesites at former residential schools across the country. But, the commissioners wrote, “it is apparent that there are likely to be other unidentified residential gravesites across the country.” A national program, they wrote, “is required to complete the task of identifying the many unmarked residential school cemeteries and gravesites across Canada”. The report was heralded as a watershed moment for the relationship between Canada and Indigenous peoples. But optimism has given way to frustration over a lack of progress and an apparent lack of ambition from the federal government. In late 2019 the Yellowhead Institute, a First Nations-led research centre at the University of Toronto, reported that just nine of the 94 calls to action had been fully addressed. In a 2020 report card, the Assembly of First Nations said there had been only “moderate progress” on identifying all of the children who died in those schools. “If we are serious about reconciliation, a term that has been so abused by the governments that no Indigenous person wants to hear that word any more, then our actions need to show that we are sincere and genuine,” Saganash said. “That is not happening.” What’s more, the government of Justin Trudeau is currently fighting a class action lawsuit, seeking reparations for the broader effort to destroy Indigenous language, culture and identity. Many Indigenous peoples are similarly vexed by Ottawa’s lack of progress in addressing Canada’s epidemic of violence against Indigenous women. Saganash, who was elected to parliament in 2011 as a member of the centre-left New Democratic party, fought for years for the creation of an inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women. But its calls to action have similarly been addressed in piecemeal fashion. If confirmed, the grim discovery in Kamloops would be one of the most significant discoveries in recent years.

Alerts were issued on Wednesday night for venues in Gundagai, Goulburn, Jervis Bay, Huskisson and Vincentia that were visited by a Melbourne family of four last month, who were later diagnosed with COVID-19 after returning home. The father had symptoms on May 25 after driving back to Melbourne on May 24. He tested positive on Monday, nearly a week later, as did his wife and children. There have been no cases recorded in NSW but several new testing facilities on the South Coast have been testing locals amid concerns the virus could have spread. The results of some of those tests should be known on Thursday. Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant on Wednesday said NSW Health was working with Victorian authorities to determine who in the family contracted the virus first. “If this gentleman was the source for those individuals, then they were not potentially infectious when they were in NSW, and clearly if the reverse is the case that may take back the exposure period,” she told reporters. Already 243 people have been instructed to get tested and isolate while they await further instructions from NSW Health. “We’ve asked (them) to stop and stay until we actually really understand and do a full assessment of the risk,” Dr Chant said. Victorian authorities believe the strain circulating in the state is much more infectious than previous variants, capable of transmitting between strangers with very minimal contact. Those concerns prompted the Victorian government to extend the lockdown for Greater Melbourne for at least another seven days until midnight on June 10. However, Dr Chant downplayed those fears, saying NSW has also had occasions of transmission with very minimal contact. Premier Gladys Berejiklian said the scare is a reminder of the urgent need for people to get vaccinated, and for testing rates to remain high. “They know the drill when there are cases in other parts of Australia,” Ms Berejiklian said. “We’ve seen more than 21,000 people come forward in the last 24 hours in NSW and get tested - that’s outstanding.” Josh Frydenberg said a decision on a dedicated quarantine facility in Victoria is just “days” away Obviously, you’re talking large sums of money and talking through the details of the location, because more than one location was put forward. And obviously, we’ve had conversations with the state government there. And it’s important to understand that that designated facility in Victoria would be over and above the existing hotel quarantine quarantine facility that exists in important and other states. ...Well, days. That’s how I would put it. And obviously, the Prime Minister and my Cabinet colleagues have been discussing these matters. Again, Josh Frydenberg is not ruling out support – but he is not announcing it either: Other states went through short-term lockdowns – namely Queensland and Western Australia. They didn’t ask for extra support*. They didn’t receive extra federal support and that was after the end of jobkeeper. But now that the lockdown has been extended, then we obviously are considering the implications of that and we do understand the need that Victorian families and businesses have right now. And hopefully, when the details of those, the easing of restrictions are announced by the state government, that that will come as some relief, particularly to regional Victorians, because you’ve got a situation in a regional city like Mildura who are probably watching your show today. More than 50,000 people. Cases where there wasn’t one for 13 months and yet they were subject to the same restrictions and lockdown at the people in inner Melbourne. So all those responses and decisions by the state government really do need to be proportionate to the challenges that we face. *This is not comparing apples and apples. Josh Frydenberg is on ABC News Breakfast, where he is talking around the idea of a one-off payment for Victorian workers but not going into any details: Well, the pandemic is not over, and neither is the support from the Morrison government. Last night I had a constructive conversation with my Victorian counterpart, treasurer Tim Pallas. The prime minister spoke to the acting premier, James Merlino. We recognise that with the extension of the lockdown, Victorian families and businesses are doing it tough, as you know. In Victoria, people have been subject to now a fourth lockdown, something that other states have been spared, and the Morrison government has been there for not just Victorians but for Australians from day one of this crisis, and will continue to provide that support. So, we’ll stick to the principles that have guided us to date with our economic support packages, namely that it will be temporary, that it will be targeted, that they will be measured and that they’ll be using existing systems. And we’ll have more to say about that in due course. Which is pretty much what he was saying yesterday as well. Paul Karp has taken another look at the sports rorts affair: Sport Australia’s claim in court that it provided final approval of $100m of grants in the sports rorts program has been undercut by evidence to the Senate inquiry that Bridget McKenzie overturned decisions and gave permission to vary grants. Minutes from Sport Australia’s finance audit and risk committee revealed that in December 2018 it believed the then-sport minister had “overturned” its recommendations, a “variation in the approval process” that it noted as a risk. But in the federal court, where it is defending the legality of the program against Beechworth Lawn Tennis Club, Sport Australia claimed it retained the final say on which applications would be approved for funding. It will be a little while before Daniel Andrews is back at work. But the tweet threads are back. The Victorian premier is still on medical leave but has tweeted out his thoughts on lockdown: Geriatric millennials and Gen X, your time has come in the ACT. It’s the last day of parliament for parliament (but it will be back in a week) and estimates continue, but everyone is waiting to see how the federal government will respond to Victoria’s extended lockdown, given that workers are now facing two weeks without pay. Acting premier James Merlino had talks with Scott Morrison overnight, while Josh Frydenberg spoke with his Victorian counterpart Tim Pallas. We know jobkeeper is out. But disaster-style payments, which already exist for states and territories when natural disasters strike, is one option. Which makes sense. Losing even a week of pay without notice is a disaster for a lot of people. Rent, loans and utilities all still need to be paid, even in a pandemic. Plus, people need to eat. We’ll be hearing from Frydenberg soon. It’s been a long week for millions of people, so hopefully we’ll have answers for you soon. Victorians have responded to the latest outbreak by getting vaccinated in record numbers but, as Christopher Knaus reports, the commonwealth hasn’t increased vaccine supply to Victoria in response. That has led to people being turned away, including aged and disability care workers, who are trying to work out their own vaccinations, given that the only way they can receive that at their work is if there are leftover doses from those supplied for residents. We should find out today whether restrictions ease in regional Victoria but it’s another long week for Melbourne residents after the lockdown was extended for seven more days.

Agency (EMA) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/28/covid-german-children-12-16-pfizer-vaccine-next-month\">approved the use of Biontech/Pfizer in children aged 12 to 15 on Friday</a>, and the government has also given the green light for its use from 7 June, the standing committee on vaccination, Stiko, which reports to the ministry of health, has still to make its recommendation.</p> \n  <p>The chair of Stiko, Thomas Mertens, has urged people to be patient, telling a <a href=\"https://www.ndr.de/nachrichten/info/podcast4684.html\">weekly podcast </a>dedicated to coronavirus developments, now on its 91st episode, that the vaccine is “no liquorice sweet” but a medical intervention.</p> \n  <p>“The decision as to whether Stiko recommends that all children between the ages of 12 and 16 be vaccinated against coronavirus must be based only on the best available evidence basis,” he said. </p> \n  <p>He stressed however, that Stiko would recommend the use of the vaccine on children with pre-existing conditions. </p> \n  <p>Mertens said the data provided by the vaccine makers resulting from their clinical studies of the mRNA vaccine were so far insufficient to recommend its use on all children. </p> \n  <p>“The number of vaccinated children in the study is simply too small in order to be able to make a reliable statement about its safety in this age group.” </p> \n  <p>Out of 1,100 children who took part in the study, about 14 of them suffered a severe reaction. </p> \n  <p>Mertens said other factors had to be taken into account when deciding whether to recommend the jab, such as a child’s risk of getting sick without a vaccine, as well as the question of herd immunity in the wider population. </p> \n  <p>Mertens said the decision was not an easy one, despite the millions of children who have already been vaccinated in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news\">US</a> and <a

<div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/germany\">Germany</a> </strong>is slowly beginning to open up again with the government’s disease control agency, the Robert Koch Institute confirming that a third wave of the virus has been broken, and the number of new infections is lower than at any time since the autumn.</p> \n  <p>Almost a fifth of all Germans have now been fully vaccinated, and about 900,000 to 1m jabs are being administered every day.</p> \n  <p>But caution is being urged as virologists say until 70% of the population have received two jabs, the situation remains fragile.</p> \n  <p>Among the much-awaited restriction easing measures taking place in Berlin from Friday are the reopening of gyms and swimming pools as well as restaurants and bars, though establishments with service both inside and out will have to demand a negative result from customers if they wish to open both areas.</p> \n  <p>The obligation to make an appointment before going shopping, so-called “<em tabindex=\"-1\">Termin Shopping</em>”, will be dropped, though mask wearing will remain the rule, including on public transport.</p> \n  <p>Despite the fact that 500 people are now allowed to meet for cultural or sporting events in the open air, 100 inside, Stephan Hengst from the Berlin Music Commission has criticised the suddenness of the announcement, saying club operators and musicians have been given little notice to be able to organise events.</p> \n  <p>Companies must continue to allow their employees to work from home wherever possible which the German Trade Union Association, DGB, has insisted is necessary. </p> \n  <p>“As long as a majority of the population is not fully vaccinated, employers must not be allowed to shirk from their responsibilities,” the DGB’s head, Reiner Hoffmann, said.</p> \n  <p>But the head of the German Association of Employers (BDA), Steffen Kampeter, has insisted companies and employees should be relied upon to make the right decision as to whether they should return or not, with regular testing and the option to continue in home office necessary measures to help manage the coming weeks and months.</p> \n  <p>From Monday, about 6,000 company doctors are expected to boost the vaccine campaign when group prioritisation rules are lifted. </p> \n  <p>Having received an initial contingent of 700,000 doses, they have said they expect to be able to carry out around 5m vaccinations every month.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time

Even in Melbourne, people were once again meeting family and friends at cafes, pubs and cinemas. Football games were played in front of packed stadiums.</p> \n  <p>But that came to an abrupt halt when a new cluster of cases was identified in Melbourne early last week. This outbreak has now grown to 60 known cases across the greater metropolitan area, including several aged care workers and two residents. Genomic sequencing links all these cases to a man who was infected while staying in an Adelaide quarantine hotel.</p> \n  <p>As Melbourne moves into a second week of lockdown, it’s worth asking why we’re back in this all too familiar situation. Two issues that loom the largest in explaining how we got here are a hotel quarantine system that clearly doesn’t work as well as it could, and a more concerning virus variant that seems to have taken full advantage of the time it circulated undetected from the Wollert man to case number five – the key piece of rotten luck in this outbreak.

Eric Lander told The Associated Press: “This is a moment in so many ways, not just health, that we can rethink fundamental assumptions about what’s possible and that’s true of climate and energy and many areas.” Brazil registered 2,507 Covid-19 deaths on Wednesday and 95,601 additional cases, according to data released by the country’s health ministry. The South American country has now registered 467,706 total coronavirus deaths and 16,720,081 confirmed cases, Reuters reports. Amazon is testing its front-line staff in Britain for coronavirus variants and feeding the data to public health officials, including in hotspots where a strain first found in India is spreading fast, Reuters reports. The retail giant opened Covid-19 testing labs in the UK and the US last year to provide voluntary testing for staff and can now also test for variants in Britain, where scientists have pioneered sequencing coronavirus genomes. Luke Meredith, director of the Amazon Diagnostic Laboratory in Britain, said the company was open to offering the same service in the US and did not rule out making its testing programme available to the UK public. “It’s very important that we acknowledge the fact that variants can transmit in different ways, they have different responses to vaccines, they may have different impacts on people’s health,” he told Reuters. “This is a learning phase.” The UK’s vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi, pressed about the dropping of restrictions on June 21, told ITV’s Peston programme: “At the moment there’s nothing in the data to suggest that we need to move the road map. “We’ve been straight with people, as both the Prime Minister and the Health Secretary have said, on June 14 we will share with the nation all the data that we’d have gathered. “The next 12 days are going to be really important to see what the virus is doing. We’ve got a very large-scale surveillance infrastructure in place in terms of waste water surveillance and large-scale testing.” On giving vaccines to children, Zahawi said: “Some children do get serious Covid and long Covid, but on the whole you’ll be vaccinating to protect families, the community and public health.” Romania has started administering Covid-19 vaccines to young teenagers aged 12 to 15, after the European Medicines Agency approved use of the Pfizer jab last week for that age group in the 27-nation European Union Associated Press reports: National vaccination committee chief Valeriu Gheorghita said more than 2,100 appointments were made for children in the past 24 hours via the online national booking platform. Vaccination centres will also accept no-appointment walk-ins, he said, speaking at the inauguration of a children’s vaccination centre in the capital, Bucharest. “By authorising the vaccination of those between 12 to 15 years old, we bring an important advantage especially for kids with chronic diseases or other conditions which make them vulnerable to serious illness,” Gheorghita said. Sir Kevan Collins has quit as the education catch-up tsar over his fears the UK government’s 1.4 billion fund to help children recover missed lessons “falls far short of what is needed”. It has been reported that he called for 15 billion of funding and 100 extra hours of teaching per pupil, rather than the 1.4 billion additional fund announced by the government. In his letter to the prime minister, Sir Kevan, who has resigned after just four months of being the education recovery commissioner, states: “One conservative estimate puts the long-term economic cost of lost learning in England due to the pandemic at 100 billion, with the average pupil having missed 115 days in school. “In parts of the country where schools were closed for longer, such as the North, the impact of low skills on productivity is likely to be particularly severe.” He warns the current package of support is “too narrow, too small and will be delivered too slowly” and the pandemic has already wreaked the greatest damage to children from disadvantaged backgrounds. An announcement from the US president: Argentina’s largest oil workers union said on Wednesday that it would call a strike if the government does not allow it to privately purchase Covid-19 vaccines amid a second wave of infections, Reuters reports. The Rio Negro, Neuquen and La Pampa Private Oil and Gas Union, representing 24,000 workers, many of them in the Vaca Muerta shale oil formation, said it would wait for government authorization until the end of next week. If permission to purchase vaccines is not granted, it said it would call a strike. “Next Friday the 11th, if there are no answers to our request, we are going to withdraw from our jobs to protect the health of all our colleagues,” the union’s leader, Guillermo Pereyra, said. France will start vaccinating teenagers from age 12 with the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine on June 15, the government said. Mexico reported 3,269 new cases of Covid-19 in the country and 306 more fatalities, Reuters reports. It brings the total to 2,423,928 infections and 228,146 deaths, according to health ministry data released on Wednesday. Spanish regions with a low Covid infection rate will be allowed to reopen nightlife before herd immunity is achieved, which is expected by mid-August, the health minister said. The Canadian province of Ontario will keep schools closed for in-person learning until the new school year starts in September, premier Doug Ford announced. Germany plans to pay vaccine manufacturers an annual reservation fee to build up reserve capacity of around 600-700m doses per year to help it fight future pandemics, the health minister said. Colombia has began what its government called a gradual opening of its border with Venezuela after a 14-month closure intended to curb the spread of the coronavirus. In Germany, the Robert Koch Institute has confirmed that a third wave of the virus has been broken. EU governments have agreed to add Japan to their small list of countries from which they will allow non-essential travel, it was reported earlier. France will start vaccinating teenagers from age 12 with the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine on June 15, the government said. France, which began vaccinations late last year with priority given to care home residents, has gradually been widening eligibility by lowering age thresholds and removing conditions such as profession or state of health. From May 31, Covid-19 vaccines were made available to everyone over 18. President Emmanuel Macron told reporters earlier on Wednesday that from June 15, young people aged 12 to 18 will be allowed to get a Covid-19 vaccine from June 15. AstraZeneca Plc is in talks with the US government to shift production of its Covid-19 vaccine from a Baltimore plant to a factory owned by Catalent Inc , the New York Times reported. AstraZeneca has been on the lookout for an alternative production site after the US government stopped it from making use of the Baltimore plant owned by Emergent BioSolutions Inc after workers accidentally contaminated a batch of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s vaccine. The British drugmaker’s vaccine has not been approved in the US. Countries and private donors have pledged nearly $2.4 billion to the COVAX vaccine-sharing plan, intended to make vaccines more available to people in poorer nations, Reuters reports. The announcements, ranging from $2,500 from island nation Mauritius to millions of dollars and doses from wealthier countries, came during a video summit hosted by Japan and the GAVI Vaccine Alliance, which leads the COVAX facility alongside the World Health Organization. Australian prime minister Scott Morrison said his country was giving a further A$50 million ($39 million) to COVAX. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation later announced a $50 million commitment to COVAX. Mexico reported 3,269 new cases of Covid-19 in the country and 306 more fatalities, Reuters reports. It brings the total to 2,423,928 infections and 228,146 deaths, according to health ministry data released on Wednesday. Separate government data recently published suggests the actual death toll is at least 60% above the confirmed figure. Here is a quick recap of all the main Covid updates from around the world: Spanish regions with a low Covid infection rate will be allowed to reopen nightlife before herd immunity is achieved, which is expected by mid-August, the health minister said. The Canadian province of Ontario will keep schools closed for in-person learning until the new school year starts in September, premier Doug Ford announced. Germany plans to pay vaccine manufacturers an annual reservation fee to build up reserve capacity of around 600-700m doses per year to help it fight future pandemics, the health minister said. Colombia has began what its government called a gradual opening of its border with Venezuela after a 14-month closure intended to curb the spread of the coronavirus. In Germany, the Robert Koch Institute has confirmed that a third wave of the virus has been broken. EU governments have agreed to add Japan to their small list of countries from which they will allow non-essential travel, it was reported earlier. Spanish regions with a low Covid-19 infection rate will be allowed to reopen nightlife before herd immunity is achieved, which is expected by mid-August, the health minister has said. Regions with a 14-day notification rate of infections below 50 cases per 100,000 people will be able to open discos and clubs until 3 am, although some restrictions will continue, Reuters reports. It was not clear whether dance floors will be allowed and the party group - a maximum of six people inside - has to remain masked, according to local media. “A gradual and progressive return to normality is needed. Lessons must be learned”, the health minister, Carolina Darias, told journalists. Health standards are in the hands of the regions in Spain, although according to the minister, this agreement is binding. Madrid, where bars and restaurants are already open until 1am despite being one of the top five regions with the highest infection rates, rejects the criteria and wants more flexibility. Spain’s overall infection rate fell to 118.5 cases per 100,000 on Wednesday, nearly halving since the end of April, but only the Balearic islands, Valencia and the North African enclave of Ceuta meet the sub-50 requirement. The US had administered 296,912,892 doses of Covid vaccines in the country as of Wednesday morning and distributed 366,977,535 doses, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Those figures are up from the 296,404,240 vaccine doses the CDC said had been administered by 1 June out of 366,317,045 doses delivered, Reuters reports. In France, the number of new Covid cases held below 10,000 for the second day in a row on Wednesday, as pressure on hospitals eased further and the daily death toll dropped sharply from last week. Reuters reports: The number of new infections is usually well below 10,000 on Mondays or the day after a public holiday, due to data reporting lags. But on Wednesday, the health ministry reported 8,743 new cases, down from 9,848 on Tuesday and the first time since September that new cases were below 10,000 two days running. On Monday, there were just 1,211 new cases, the lowest level for a Monday since mid-August. The ministry also reported that the number of people in intensive care units with Covid-19 fell by 71 to 2,754, getting closer to the 2021 low of 2,582 set on 7 January, and down from a 2021 high of 6,001 at the end of April. The Canadian province of Ontario will keep schools closed for in-person learning until the new school year starts in September, premier Doug Ford has announced. Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, took schools back to online learning in April as the third Covid wave threatened to overwhelm hospital and healthcare systems. The decision to keep schools closed “was a hard choice to make, but I will not - and I repeat, I will not - take unnecessary risks with our children right now,” Ford said, citing the increased danger posed by variants to younger people. But Ford also said that the province could begin its planned three-step reopening plan sooner, if the chief medical officer gave his blessing, Reuters reports. The province announced in May that it would start slowly reopening restaurants and retail during the week of 14 June if certain vaccination targets were met. Facing questions of whether he was choosing the economy over schools, Ford said not enough teachers and students were vaccinated to make reopening schools safe. In Australia, Melbourne GPs say they are being forced to turn away huge numbers of vaccine-seeking locals, including busloads of vulnerable residents from care facilities, because the commonwealth’s supply of doses has not increased to match the explosion in demand. The latest outbreak has caused a huge increase in demand for the Covid-19 vaccine in Victoria, and the state is now recording daily vaccination numbers of above 20,000, up from the roughly 2,600 doses administered on 24 May. The demand has inundated local GPs, who say their supplies of vaccine doses are evaporating almost immediately. My colleague Christopher Knaus has the full story here: Canada’s chief medical officers have said the country should seek to administer second Covid vaccine doses as soon as possible as inoculation supply rises and variants spread, according to a statement. As Reuters reports, Canada delayed second doses for up to 16 weeks as it pushed to get first shots into peoples’ arms. Now almost 60% of adults have received a first dose, while less than 6% are fully vaccinated. In a joint statement, the chief medical officers from each province and territory: Given Canada’s current and projected vaccine supply, second doses should be offered as soon as possible, with priority given to those at highest risk of severe illness and death from Covid-19. Urban crime ranging from vehicle theft and burglary to robbery and assault fell substantially during Covid lockdowns as stay-at-home orders around the world cleared the streets and ensured more houses were occupied in the daytime. An analysis of crime reports from 27 cities in Europe, Asia and the Americas found overall urban crime fell by more than a third while lockdowns were in place and then steadily climbed back up when restrictions were lifted. Robberies fell on average by 46%, and vehicle theft and daily assaults were down 39% and 35% respectively. Burglaries dropped by 28% overall, while more minor crimes such as pickpocketing and shoplifting fell by about 47% across the countries studied. Manuel Eisner, a professor of criminology at the University of Cambridge, said the declines were sharp but short-lived, with the lowest crime rates reported two to five weeks after lockdowns came into force. “After that, the figures start to creep up again,” he said. Ian Sample, the Guardian’s science editor, has the latest here: Argentina will begin to produce the Sputnik V Covid vaccine locally after test batches from the South American country passed quality tests conducted by Russia’s Gamaleya Institute, the health minister Carla Vizzotti has said. In April, Argentine firm Laboratorios Richmond produced test batches of the vaccine, with plans to scale up once Russia had carried out quality inspections. Vizzotti told reporters: The Gamaleya Institute has confirmed the quality control of three consecutive batches of component one and three consecutive batches of component two. Yesterday, we were informed that the quality control was satisfactory and that we are going to advance in the import of antigens of component 1 and 2 so that Argentina is part of the Sputnik V vaccine production chain. The announcement comes as Argentina battles a harsh second wave of infections. The virus has left 78,733 dead and 3.8m infected in Argentina since the start of the pandemic last year, Reuters reports. The EU has delayed putting the UK on a “white list” of countries from where non-essential travel into the bloc is approved because of concerns about the rise in cases linked to the Delta variant first identified in India. Japan, which is in an extended state of emergency during which it has enjoyed a sustained reduction in infection cases, has been added to the list, diplomatic sources said. The country is due to host the Olympic Games on 23 July. The decision in principle was made during a meeting of ambassadors in Brussels on Wednesday. Sources said the UK’s status would be examined again on 14 June. Daniel Boffey, the Guardian’s Brussels bureau chief, has the full story here: Lack of effective political leadership has hampered efforts to stop the Covid-19 pandemic in Latin America, where infections are dangerously on the rise again, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) said. While the United States, Canada, and Mexico are reporting overall reductions in Covid-19 cases and deaths, new infections are increasing in the rest of the Americas, PAHO Director Carissa Etienne said. Colombia is reporting the highest rate of infections in South America, where new cases have nearly tripled in some regions, and Brazil is seeing a rise in new infections and hospitalizations, she said. But without effective leadership, Latin American countries are failing in their response to the illness. “Sadly, across our region, we’ve seen misinformation about Covid-19 sow doubt on proven health measures, often in the context of political disputes,” Etienne said in a briefing. “By stoking controversy where there is none, our leaders are sending mixed messages to the public and standing in the way of effective measures to control the virus,” she said. Of greatest concern now is Haiti, where despite sharp increases in cases, hospitalisations, and deaths, public health measures required to stop transmission are being largely ignored by the population, Etienne said. Britain is in talks with AstraZeneca for additional doses of its Covid-19 vaccine that will have been modified to better target the Beta coronavirus variant first identified in South Africa, health minister Matt Hancock said. Britain has previously secured 100 million doses of the vaccine, developed at the University of Oxford and licensed to AstraZeneca. “We’ve started commercial negotiations with AstraZeneca to secure a variant vaccine: future supplies of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine that have been adapted to tackle the B.1.351 variant first identified in South Africa,” Hancock said in a speech at the university. Italy has reported 62 coronavirus deaths and 2,897 cases, according to the latest data. The United States, Canada, and Mexico are reporting overall reductions in Covid-19 cases and deaths, though overall new infections are on the rise again in the rest of the Americas, the head of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), Carissa Etienne, said. Colombia is reporting the highest rate of infections in South America, where new cases have nearly tripled in some regions, and Brazil is seeing a rise in new infections and hospitalizations. Despite sharp increases in cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in Haiti, public health measures required to stop transmission there are being largely ignored by the population, Etienne warned. Britain reported a further 4,330 cases of coronavirus and 12 more deaths within 28 days of a positive test, according to official data. The total number of people to have received the first dose of a vaccine stood at 39,585,665, the figures showed. Japan’s prime minister announced Wednesday an additional $800m contribution to the U.N.-backed initiative to provide COVID-19 vaccines to poor countries, a four-fold increase of Japanese funding for the COVAX program. The pledge by prime minister Yoshihide Suga comes as his government attempts to accelerate vaccinations in Japan, one of the world’s least inoculated countries, only about 50 days before it hosts the Olympics amid a continuing surge in infections. He spoke as Japan co-sponsored a fundraising event for COVAX with Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which helps run the program. The program managers are seeking about $2bn more to reach a target of $8.3bn for its effort to fund free vaccines for low- and middle-income countries around the world. Global airline body IATA increased pressure on governments to ease travel restrictions on Wednesday, pointing to UK testing data that showed low incidence of Covid-19 in arriving passengers, Reuters reports. “These data tell us we can do better,” IATA Director General Willie Walsh said, citing a 2.2% positive rate among 365,895 tests carried out in February-May, according to the NHS figures. Germany plans to pay vaccine manufacturers an annual reservation fee to build up reserve capacity of around 600-700m doses per year to help it fight future pandemics, health minister Jens Spahn has said. The government plans to launch a call for tenders for so-called pandemic preparedness contracts with a five-year term so that vaccine doses “can be activated quickly if the worst comes to the worst,” Spahn told a news conference. Manufacturing setbacks and an over-reliance on EU approval for supplies slowed Germany’s rollout of Covid vaccines. It wants to boost domestic production to ensure it is not deprived of shots in future pandemics, Reuters reports. The stand-by contracts will help maintain know-how acquired during the pandemic so that next time “we don’t have to ramp up production from zero to 100,” Christoph Krupp, head of the vaccine production task force told reporters. “We want to bet on several companies and several vaccine types and not just one,” Krupp added. Reuters reports: Colombia on Wednesday began what its government called a gradual opening of its border with Venezuela after a 14-month closure intended to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Colombia, whose porous border with Venezuela extends roughly 1,380 miles (2,220km), has been the chief destination for Venezuelans fleeing their country’s social and economic crisis. The two countries do not maintain diplomatic relations. The gradual opening of river and land crossings was authorised starting at midnight on Wednesday, according to a resolution published by the Andean nation’s interior ministry. The interior ministry said biosecurity measures in light of the Covid-19 pandemic established by Colombia’s health ministry must be followed during crossings. Colombia closed its borders in March 2020. Rodrigo Duterte, president of the Philippines, has appealed to the public to get vaccinated against Covid-19, after data showed the government was far behind its immunisation targets, Reuters reports. In a televised address, Duterte said: I invite all our countrymen to be vaccinated at the earliest possible opportunity because this is the most, if not the only way, effective way, to defeat the Covid-19 pandemic. Let us all keep in mind that the vaccine will not only protect you from the virus, it will also protect your loved ones, especially the sick and elderly. John Wong, a data analyst on the government’s Covid taskforce, said that in the three months since early inoculations started, just 14% of senior citizens and 8% of people with health conditions had received first doses of a vaccine, short of the 21% target. Wong attributed the slow rollout to limited vaccine supplies, vaccine hesitancy and accessibility problems. As Reuters reports, the chairman of the Gavi vaccine alliance, Jose Manuel Barroso, has said that a pledging summit secured nearly $2.4bn, bringing total contributions nearly to $9.6bn for the Covax dose-sharing programme to buy vaccines and deliver them to poorer nations (see earlier post). Egypt aims to vaccinate 40% of its population against Covid-19 by the end of this year, the prime minister said in a televised address. By the end of Wednesday, 2.5 million people will have been vaccinated from a total of 6 million who signed up on the government’s registration platform, Reuters reported Mostafa Madbouly as saying. The first batch of locally made vaccines will be ready in July, Madbouly added. A debate over whether children in Germany should be vaccinated is showing no signs of letting up. Whilst the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved the use of Biontech/Pfizer in children aged 12 to 15 on Friday, and the government has also given the green light for its use from 7 June, the standing committee on vaccination, Stiko, which reports to the ministry of health, has still to make its recommendation. The chair of Stiko, Thomas Mertens, has urged people to be patient, telling a weekly podcast dedicated to coronavirus developments, now on its 91st episode, that the vaccine is “no liquorice sweet” but a medical intervention. “The decision as to whether Stiko recommends that all children between the ages of 12 and 16 be vaccinated against coronavirus must be based only on the best available evidence basis,” he said. He stressed however, that Stiko would recommend the use of the vaccine on children with pre-existing conditions. Mertens said the data provided by the vaccine makers resulting from their clinical studies of the mRNA vaccine were so far insufficient to recommend its use on all children. “The number of vaccinated children in the study is simply too small in order to be able to make a reliable statement about its safety in this age group.” Out of 1,100 children who took part in the study, about 14 of them suffered a severe reaction. Mertens said other factors had to be taken into account when deciding whether to recommend the jab, such as a child’s risk of getting sick without a vaccine, as well as the question of herd immunity in the wider population. Mertens said the decision was not an easy one, despite the millions of children who have already been vaccinated in the US and Israel. “It’s not like offering the children a liquorice sweet,” he said. “This is a medical intervention”. He added it was extremely rare for children to have a severe bout of coronavirus and that also had to be part of the equation. The European budget airline Wizz Air plunged to a €576m annual loss as it warned 2021 would be a “transition year” with further losses to come until travel restrictions are fully lifted. The carrier’s revenue slumped by 73% in the 12 months to the end of March, the period covering the first year of Covid-19, and it carried 10m passengers, a 75% fall compared with a year earlier. The airline said it had carried more than 830,000 passengers in May, while its planes were two-thirds full. József Váradi, the chief executive, said: We expect [this] to be a transition year where we will experience a slow but gradual recovery, mostly subject to the pace of vaccinations globally including in Europe. You can read the latest by my colleague Joanna Partridge here: Australia and European countries have announced fresh contributions to the Covax doses-sharing mechanism, in an attempt to widen vaccination of people in low and middle income countries. Australian prime minister Scott Morrison said that his country was making a further $50m donation to the Gavi vaccine alliance’s Covax facility, bringing its total to $130m. Pedro Sánchez, Spain’s prime minister, who announced a donation of 15m doses and $61m, said: “Only by leading by example we will be effective in preaching solidarity.” Sweden, Austria and Luxembourg were among other countries to also announce new donations, Reuters notes. Germany is slowly beginning to open up again with the government’s disease control agency, the Robert Koch Institute confirming that a third wave of the virus has been broken, and the number of new infections is lower than at any time since the autumn. Almost a fifth of all Germans have now been fully vaccinated, and about 900,000 to 1m jabs are being administered every day. But caution is being urged as virologists say until 70% of the population have received two jabs, the situation remains fragile. Among the much-awaited restriction easing measures taking place in Berlin from Friday are the reopening of gyms and swimming pools as well as restaurants and bars, though establishments with service both inside and out will have to demand a negative result from customers if they wish to open both areas. The obligation to make an appointment before going shopping, so-called “Termin Shopping”, will be dropped, though mask wearing will remain the rule, including on public transport. Despite the fact that 500 people are now allowed to meet for cultural or sporting events in the open air, 100 inside, Stephan Hengst from the Berlin Music Commission has criticised the suddenness of the announcement, saying club operators and musicians have been given little notice to be able to organise events. Companies must continue to allow their employees to work from home wherever possible which the German Trade Union Association, DGB, has insisted is necessary. “As long as a majority of the population is not fully vaccinated, employers must not be allowed to shirk from their responsibilities,” the DGB’s head, Reiner Hoffmann, said. But the head of the German Association of Employers (BDA), Steffen Kampeter, has insisted companies and employees should be relied upon to make the right decision as to whether they should return or not, with regular testing and the option to continue in home office necessary measures to help manage the coming weeks and months. From Monday, about 6,000 company doctors are expected to boost the vaccine campaign when group prioritisation rules are lifted. Having received an initial contingent of 700,000 doses, they have said they expect to be able to carry out around 5m vaccinations every month. EU governments have agreed to add Japan to their small list of countries from which they will allow non-essential travel, while holding off until at least mid-June for British tourists, EU sources have confirmed. Reuters reports: Ambassadors from the EU’s 27 countries approved the addition of Japan at a meeting on Wednesday, with the change to take effect in the coming days. EU countries are recommended gradually to lift travel restrictions for the current seven countries on the list- Australia, Israel, New Zealand, Rwanda, Singapore, South Korea and Thailand. Individual EU countries can still opt to demand a negative Covid-19 test or a period of quarantine. The EU last month eased criteria for adding new countries to the list, by changing to 75 from 25 the maximum number of new Covid-19 cases per 100,000 people in the previous 14 days. Britain met that revised target but was left off the list because of an increase in Covid-19 cases arising from an infectious coronavirus variant first identified in India. South Australian health authorities have warned AFL fans not to touch the ball if it flies into the crowd during Adelaide’s home game against Collingwood, sparking puns about possible “airborne transmission” of Covid. The Melbourne-based Magpies have been granted a special exemption to travel to South Australia for Saturday’s twilight clash with the Crows at Adelaide Oval, which has been operating with full-capacity crowds since early May. South Australia’s chief public health officer, Prof Nicola Spurrier, on Wednesday defended the decision to allow the team to visit despite the border being closed to Victoria amid the state’s growing Covid-19 cluster. Spurrier described the exemption as a “special situation”, saying the risk was “negligible” because the team was already in quarantine at home in Melbourne along with their families or housemates.

Its director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesuis, is speaking at the Gavi Covax summit. Vietnam’s health minister has said that Russia has agreed to provide it with 20m doses of its Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine this year, Reuters reports. The south-east Asian country approved the Russian vaccine in March but has stepped up its procurement push after being hit by its biggest outbreak so far, although its overall cases and fatality numbers remain relatively low. “Vietnam is trying to get access to Covid-19 vaccine sources to speed up its vaccination rollout at the earliest,” health minister Nguyen Thanh Long said in a statement announcing the Sputnik V agreement. At least 220 million people globally are expected to remain unemployed this year, well above pre-pandemic levels, with a weak labour market recovery exacerbating existing inequalities, the International Labour Organization (ILO) has said. The UN agency forecast the outlook improving to 205 million unemployed next year – still well above the 187 million recorded in 2019 before the onset of the pandemic, Reuters reports. According to ILO models, that equates to a global unemployment rate of 6.3% this year, falling to 5.7% next year but still up on the pre-pandemic rate of 5.4% in 2019. In a report, World Employment and Social Outlook: Trends 2021, the ILO said: Employment growth will be insufficient to make up for the losses suffered until at least 2023.

Checkpoints between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides of Cyprus are to reopen on Friday, the United Nations has said, marking the first time restrictions have been eased since December 2020 because of the pandemic. Cyprus is split between its Greek and Turkish Cypriot populations, with a number of designated checkpoints controlling movements between the north and south of the island. “The reopening of all crossing points will facilitate free movement, promote people to people contacts, build trust and have an overall positive socio-economic impact across the island for the benefit of all Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots,” the United Nations mission on Cyprus, UNFICYP, said in a statement. Reuters report that a committee of health experts from both sides would be assessing the situation on a bi-weekly basis. Vehicle and pedestrian crossings have been subject to on-and-off closures since February 2020, when the Greek Cypriot side shut the checkpoints for the first time in decades as a precaution to quell the spread of the virus. Under present circumstances, people who cross will require a seven-day negative antigen test or PCR test, the peacekeeping mission said. Rural northern California is seeing a troubling rise in Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations, an alarming trend that comes as residents and businesses continue to protest against safety measures and vaccinations – with one Mendocino cafe threatening to charge customers $5 for wearing a mask. While the region makes up a small proportion of the state’s population, the growth in its caseload has been considerable, and comes at a time when the state overall is enjoying some of the lowest rates of Covid in the country. After largely avoiding the worst of the pandemic, a block of far northern California counties now leads the state with nearly 40 cases per 100,000 residents over the past week, according to statistics maintained by the Los Angeles Times. Tehama county ranked the highest in the LA Times case ratings with 139 cases per 100,000 residents. Meanwhile 10 of the 21 total Covid deaths in nearby Siskiyou county have occurred since the beginning of May. The region has long been one of the most forceful in its pushback against measures such as masks, business restrictions and vaccine mandates – and the protests have only continued to gain steam. A cafe in the town of Mendocino made headlines after announcing it will charge customers a $5 fee if they order while wearing a mask. It also threatened to charge $5 to anyone “caught bragging about your vaccine”. “It’s about time the proponents of these ineffective government measures start paying for the collateral damage they have collectively caused,” the cafe owner Chris Castleman told NBC News. He also offered a 50% discount to customers who threw their masks in the trash. George Rutherford, a professor of epidemiology at the University of California, San Francisco, said the current situation feels inevitable. “I was waiting for this to happen,” he said, adding that the outbreaks mirror trends occurring in southern and eastern Oregon, just north of California’s border. “It shows you where vaccination is lagging and transmission is taking place.” Read more of Erin McCormick’s report from Berkeley: ‘Waiting to happen’: the California region where masks are taboo - and cases are rising The World Health Organization has approved the Sinovac Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use – the second Chinese vaccine to receive the WHO’s green light. The WHO said the emergency use listing gives countries, funders, procuring agencies and communities assurance that the vaccine has met international standards. Last month Sinopharm became the first Chinese vaccine to be approved by the WHO. The GAVI vaccine alliance is in talks with Sinovac to expand the Covax dose-sharing portfolio available to poor countries following the WHO approval. India has reported 132,788 new cases over the past 24 hours, and an additional 3,207 deaths. China has reported 24 new cases, including 10 domestic cases all in Guangdong province where authorities have imposed localised lockdown measures to control an outbreak. International flights to Vietnam’s two biggest cities are to resume, reversing a short-lived ban imposed over fears of a new coronavirus wave. AstraZeneca has said it would soon provide Thailand with 1.8m doses of locally manufactured Covid-19 vaccine, the first of multiple batches this month, just days out from the launch of its mass vaccination drive. Germany’s top diplomat in Taipei has said his government has been helping in talks between Taiwan and drugmaker BioNTech to supply Covid-19 vaccines, after Taiwan said a deal fell apart earlier this year due to Chinese “intervention”. Taiwan announced 372 new cases and 12 deaths in its latest daily update. Poland will raise the limit for the number of guests at large gatherings such as weddings to 150 from 50 from 6 June. People who have been vaccinated against the coronavirus will not be counted as part of this limit Russia’s single-dose Sputnik Light vaccine has been approved for use in Mauritius. Russia’s third vaccine, CoviVac, is more than 80% effective, according to preliminary data. Mexico has revised its death count, adding 4,272 fatalities. The clinical review of past deaths, by a team of doctors and nurses, is largely a record-keeping exercise. The Victorian government in Australia will now require people to check in at retail stores and supermarkets regardless of the length of time they spend in the store, as new data reveals a huge increase in check-ins to the Service Victoria app once the state forced businesses to begin using it. The Victorian government in Australia will now require people to check in at retail stores and supermarkets regardless of the length of time they spend in the store, as new data reveals a huge increase in check-ins to the Service Victoria app once the state forced businesses to begin using it. As part of the extension of the lockdown in Melbourne, the acting premier, James Merlino, announced on Wednesday that supermarkets and retailers would be required to make everyone check in when they entered into the store. Previously it was only a recommendation. After the state recorded a number of Covid-19 transmissions at retail stores where the contacts had “fleeting” contact, Victoria’s chief health officer, Prof Brett Sutton, said the change was to ensure records of everyone at potential exposure sites were complete. “We are in a position now where the Victorian community is motivated to do the right thing and they understand the importance of contact tracing in this space,” he said. “And even though we have been doing really well in identifying people at all exposure sites, I think everyone recognises that we have to do absolutely everything in our power to be able to chase down every single person who may be exposed because it is that one person who is not found who may be the one who spreads it.” The Victorian government launched its Covid QR-code check-in app, Service Victoria, at the end of November 2020 but continued to allow hospitality venues to to use their own QR-code systems to record people visiting. Read more of Josh Taylor’s report here: Victoria makes Covid check-in mandatory at shops after transmissions from ‘fleeting’ visits Drugmaker AstraZeneca has said it would soon provide Thailand with 1.8m doses of locally manufactured Covid-19 vaccine, the first of multiple batches this month, just days out from the launch of its mass vaccination drive. The announcement in a joint statement by AstraZeneca and Siam Bioscience, a firm owned by Thailand’s king, comes amid public anxiety about vaccine supplies, as the country suffers its most severe outbreak so far. The statement did not say whether the Thai plant would make all 6m doses that Thailand’s government has promised would be available this month. Reuters report that the government’s immunisation drive starts on Monday and relies almost entirely on its reserved 61m doses of AstraZeneca vaccine, the majority of which it said would come from Siam Bioscience, which is making vaccines for the first time. Questions about Siam Bioscience meeting production targets are sensitive because King Maha Vajiralongkorn is its sole owner. Insulting Thailand’s monarchy is a crime punishable by up to 15 years in prison. Thai health minister Anutin Charnvirakul said on Wednesday the promised 6m doses would come this month “as planned”, but did not specify delivery dates or how many would be sourced locally. “We will get AstraZeneca vaccine. It may come from wherever, but all AstraZeneca just the same. It could be made in Thailand or imported from overseas. It depends on AstraZeneca’s supply chain,” Anutin told reporters. A one-liner from Reuters here that Russia’s single-dose Sputnik Light vaccine against Covid-19 has been approved for use in Mauritius, Russia’s RDIF sovereign wealth fund, which markets the shot internationally, said today. Germany’s top diplomat in Taipei has said his government has been helping in talks between Taiwan and drugmaker BioNTech to supply Covid-19 vaccines, after Taiwan said a deal fell apart earlier this year due to Chinese “intervention”. China denied that accusation. But a war of words escalated after Taiwan rejected Beijing’s offer to supply it with shots made by Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group, which holds a contract to sell them in Greater China. In a Facebook post in Chinese on Wednesday, Thomas Prinz, Germany’s de facto ambassador to Taiwan, said they had “noticed the recent controversy regarding vaccine acquisition”. “Please believe that the German government, especially federal economy minister Altmaier himself, have made great efforts in the continuous communication and coordination between Taiwan and BioNTech,” he said, adding that whether a contract is eventually signed would depend on the two parties, report Reuters. “If the parties to the contract can reach a consensus, the federal government is naturally happy to see it happen.” Nicola Slawson has opened up our UK live blog for the day, which is immediately leading with the debate over the government’s plan for post-pandemic “catch-up” education provision in England. You can follow that with her here: I’ll be continuing here with the latest coronavirus developments from around the world. My colleague Frances Ryan writes for us this morning about how transformational being able to work from home has been life-changing for disabled people, and says don’t take it away now: At the start of the first lockdown, I reported that society was opening up to millions of disabled and chronically ill people as “virtual living” became the norm – from Zoom job interviews and streamed gigs and theatre to NHS phone appointments. But just as it took the non-disabled public to experience a dose of what disabled people have for years before access was improved, the fear is that any gains made during the pandemic will be discarded now that the wider public no longer need them themselves. Take work for example. The shift to working at home over the past year brought new opportunities to those previously excluded from the workforce. As one woman with agoraphobia told me: “Lockdown has opened my world” – it allowed her to get a job from her front room. But as ministers and some employers push for a return to the office, many disabled workers are worried their hard-won progress will go backwards. A research scientist with endometriosis and IBS told me her employer has already stopped letting her work from home full-time, even though her job can be done remotely. “The office is ‘going back to normal’ and they don’t want us at home even though I can do a better job [here],” she said. The Zoom pub quiz became a cliche of lockdown, but what many of us did informally with friends was also replicated by companies, with art exhibitions streaming online or bars running virtual club nights. As venues open back up, I’m hearing from scores of disabled people losing out. Read more here: Frances Ryan – Remote working has been life-changing for disabled people, don’t take it away now The GAVI vaccine alliance is in talks with Chinese drugmaker Sinovac to expand the Covax dose-sharing portfolio available to poor countries following the World Health Organization’s approval of its Covid-19 vaccine earlier today, a GAVI spokesperson said. “Gavi, on behalf of the Covax Facility, is in dialogue with several manufacturers, including Sinovac, to expand and diversify the portfolio further and secure access to additional doses for Facility participants,” a statement reported by Reuters said. The main Covid focus in England today hasn’t been the pandemic itself, but government proposals to help pupils “catch-up” on learning they may have missed. The package has been roundly criticised, as Haroon Siddique reports: The £1.4bn announced for the post-pandemic catch-up programme for pupils in England is “pitiful” and a fraction of that committed by other countries to help children’s education, a school leaders’ union has said. Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), hit out at the government on Wednesday as it faced scrutiny over why the money is about a 10th of the £15bn total understood to have been recommended by the education recovery commissioner, Sir Kevan Collins. Barton said the government package was “dispiriting” and accused the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, of having lower ambitions for children than those of his union’s members. “It’s pretty pitiful, only yesterday we were hearing stories about extending the school day and even if some people disagreed with it, at least there was a sense of ‘let’s do something radical, let’s do something different’,” he told Sky News. “Today’s announcement essentially equates to £50 per head, you compare that with the USA which is putting £1,600 per head, per young person, or the Netherlands, £2,500 per head. So what is it about those children in the Netherlands or the USA that makes them worth more than our government seems to say? It’s time to stop the rhetoric I think and start the action on behalf of children and young people.” During a series of interviews of Wednesday, Williamson struggled to explain the discrepancy between the announced government spending and that recommended by Collins, who was appointed in February by Downing Street to lead efforts to make up for the damage done by the coronavirus pandemic, particularly to pupils from more deprived backgrounds.

People who have been vaccinated against the coronavirus will not be counted as part of this limit, Reuters report that Adam Niedzielski told a news conference. Many countries in the world have been looking on enviously at the very small number of cases in Australia over recent months, but a new cluster has left people asking questions about the country’s approach. Michael Toole writes for us this morning: Just two weeks ago, Australians were living in a Covid-19-free environment that was unthinkable this time last year. Even in Melbourne, people were once again meeting family and friends at cafes, pubs and cinemas. Football games were played in front of packed stadiums. But that came to an abrupt halt when a new cluster of cases was identified in Melbourne early last week. This outbreak has now grown to 60 known cases across the greater metropolitan area, including several aged care workers and two residents. Genomic sequencing links all these cases to a man who was infected while staying in an Adelaide quarantine hotel. As Melbourne moves into a second week of lockdown, it’s worth asking why we’re back in this all too familiar situation. Two issues that loom the largest in explaining how we got here are a hotel quarantine system that clearly doesn’t work as well as it could, and a more concerning virus variant that seems to have taken full advantage of the time it circulated undetected from the Wollert man to case number five – the key piece of rotten luck in this outbreak. Add to that a painfully slow rollout of vaccines and, deeply worryingly, the related lack of attention to the safety of aged care home residents and staff. Read more here: Michael Toole – Australia is in a race against Covid-19. I’m waiting to hear the starting gun International flights to Vietnam’s two biggest cities are to resume, AFP reports, reversing a short-lived ban imposed over fears of a new coronavirus wave. The Civil Aviation Administration of Vietnam on Monday announced a temporary suspension for international passenger arrivals at Hanoi’s Noi Bai airport from 1-7 June. A similar decision was in force for the airport in commercial capital Ho Chi Minh City until 14 June, as the country struggles to contain a virus outbreak in more than half of its territories. But today the aviation authority told airports and airlines that it had reversed the suspension, without mentioning a timeframe or giving an explanation. Vietnam has managed to keep infection rates low, but cases have more than doubled in the past month and now stand at more than 7,500, with 48 deaths. With less than two months left until the start of the Tokyo Olympic Games, Japan’s Asahi Breweries still doesn’t know whether fans will be allowed into stadiums to buy its beer. Japan has scaled back its Olympic plans amid the pandemic and a slow national vaccine rollout. Foreign spectators won’t be allowed in the country and organisers have yet to decide how many domestic spectators, if any, can attend. More than 60 Japanese companies together paid a record of more than $3bn to sponsor the Tokyo Games, an event most Japanese want cancelled or delayed again. Sponsors paid another $200m to extend contracts after the Games were delayed last year. Many are uncertain how to proceed with advertising campaigns or marketing events, according to 12 officials and sources at companies directly involved in sponsorship who spoke to Reuters. Asahi has the exclusive rights to sell beer, wine and non-alcoholic beer at the stadiums, but even if spectators are allowed, the Tokyo government has no plans to allow alcohol at its public viewing sites outside venues, a representative said. Sponsors have grown frustrated with what they see as slow decision-making and have complained to the organisers, Eimi Yamamitsu and Maki Shiraki report. “There are so many different scenarios that we can’t prepare,” said the source. Some domestic firms, worried about opposition to the Games, have called off plans for commercials featuring Olympic athletes or supporting Japanese national teams, said a person with direct knowledge of the matter. “I’m worried that by airing Olympic ads, it could be negative for the company,” said a source at a domestic sponsor. “At this point, no amount of publicity we could get would make up for what we paid.” Some top-tier global sponsors, whose contracts run until 2024, are scaling down Tokyo promotions and deferring budgets for Beijing in 2022 or Paris in 2024, said a second person with direct knowledge of the matter, and the employee of the sponsor company who was briefed on the issue. But domestic sponsors don’t have another Olympics. “That’s why we can’t simply quit,” said the source at the domestic sponsor. Bit of a reporting chain here, but Reuters is quoting Interfax saying that Russia’s third vaccine against Covid-19, CoviVac, is more than 80% effective according to preliminary data. The Chumakov Centre could produce six times more than the previously planned 10m doses of the vaccine a year, Interfax added. Australia’s Covid vaccination programme has lacked urgency at every stage, with the government forced to revise its own targets and never seeming to meet its own goals. Victoria’s latest outbreak has exposed Scott Morrison government’s failure to successfully get the vaccine out to even the most vulnerable in the community. The outbreak has hit unvaccinated aged care workers, despite federal promises they would be vaccinated by March. Along with mixed messages about the urgency of getting Australia vaccinated, the Morrison government became mired in a debate about whether Australia’s coronavirus vaccination rollout is or is not a race. Our multimedia team has put together this video report: Taiwan has announced 372 new cases of Covid-19 and 12 deaths in its latest daily update. The CECC also announced 177 cases across the preceding five days from the backlog of test results. The number is a significant increase from yesterday, when 262 new cases were reported, with just 65 from the backlog. The backlog is clearing, authorities have assured, but in the meantime it has continued to cause problems in analysis of trends and response measures. Health and welfare minister Chen Shih-Chung said it wasn’t clear if today’s rise was due to an increase in cases or faster reporting times, local media said. Chen also gave some updates about Taiwan’s vaccination process – a complicated issue, which involves accusations of geopolitical interference as well as of government bungling. The government has procured around 1m doses so far for 23.5 million people, and has ordered tens of millions more – a significant proportion of which are domestically produced vaccine candidates in trial stage. Chen told the media he hopes that once they have enough supply, they will be able to administer 1m doses per week, through Taiwan’s 300 hospitals, 800 clinics and 200 other locations. According to local media he said any businesses with more than 1,000 employees can host a vaccination stop. Chen said the government hopes to have 60% of the population receive at least one dose by October. It’s potentially a tall order, requiring about 14m doses. Currently Taiwan has received 850,000 doses, a mix of AstraZeneca and Moderna. It has ordered about 4.5m more from Moderna, 9.2m from Astrazeneca, and 4.7m via Covax, but the imminent arrival of any of these is far from confirmed given the aforementioned complications and global shortages. Another 10m have been ordered via two Taiwan producers, but these vaccines are still in trial stage. Producers have said they intend to apply for emergency use this month – international approval likely a long way after that. In the UK, Labour’s opposition spokesperson on education, Kate Green, has called for more support for extra-curricular activities in schools as part of the Covid catch-up package being proposed by the government. She told BBC Breakfast: “What we’re proposing is that there should be a range of measures in a package of support for children and young people. “Yes more time for small group tutoring and catching up on lost learning, but children can’t learn well if they’re worried, if they’re anxious, if they’re not having time to play and develop. “So we’re also suggesting support for extra-curricular activities, play, drama, art and so on, and of course in putting in mental health support in schools.” PA Media reports she added: “Children need some time to relax and enjoy life, over the summer and into the new school year we think the important thing is to make sure the fabulous facilities that schools have, the sports fields, the art rooms, the music rooms and so on, can be used for out-of-school activities too. “So we’re talking about school being open for longer but not for lots of extra formal learning, we don’t want children doing maths at five and six in the evening when they’re really tired.” Somewhere, someone in the UK government wrote “education” on their media grid for today, and so education minister Gavin Williamson has been sent out on the airwaves with details of plans to help pupils in the UK catch-up with schooling they may have missed during the pandemic. He has endured quite a torrid time in a somewhat bad-tempered appearance on Sky News, where at one point he was told that the presenter hates doing shouty, repetitive interviews, but that the minister just wasn’t answering the questions. In particular, he was pressed over the discrepancy between the money offered – £1.4bn – and the amount that catch-up tsar Sir Kevan Collins has said is needed to increase education opportunities – £15bn. PA Media quotes Williams as saying: “It is a lot of money and it builds on £1.7bn that we’ve already committed in terms of actually delivering for children – it is an extra 100m hours of tutoring. “It is making sure that children who need that help, who need that support, that we’re delivering that tutoring revolution to help them get it. “But we recognise it is part of a process. Over the past 12 months, we have already announced a previous £1.7bn worth of additional funding and we are looking at a whole raft of additional ideas for how we can continue to support our children, making sure none of them are left behind. “We have been working very closely with Sir Kevan Collins and actually the interventions around tutoring, driving up teaching quality, these are very much built on the work we’ve been doing together, recognising how incredibly important it is that we take on these interventions in order to help children.” There’s more detail on the government plans here from my colleagues Peter Walker and Rachel Hall, who write that: Pupils will be offered an extra 100m hours of tuition under post-pandemic catch-up plans unveiled today – but the government faced immediate criticism of the £1.4bn programme, with its own tsar warning “more will be needed”. After months of unprecedented school closures, £1.4bn will be spent on up to 6m sets of 15-hour tutoring courses for disadvantaged pupils as well as an expansion of an existing fund for helping 16- to 19-year-olds with subjects such as English and maths, the Department for Education (DfE) said. There is also provision for extra training and support for teachers, and funding to allow some year-13 students to repeat their final year if it was badly affected by the pandemic. It gave no immediate verdict on mooted plans to extend schools days by 30 minutes. This idea, criticised as misplaced by some teaching unions, will be the subject of a separate review due to report later in the year. Today’s WorldView email from the Washington Post by Ishaan Tharoor makes for quite bleak reading. He writes that while in the US, life is returning to normal, the pandemic is getting worse, even when it seems like it’s getting better: The pandemic is hardly in retreat elsewhere. The emergence of more virulent variants and the slowness of vaccination efforts in many places outside the West have contributed to deadly new waves. Coronavirus case counts worldwide are already higher in 2021 than they were in 2020. Southeast Asia, once a bastion of resistance to the virus, is in the grip of a harrowing spike in infections. Cases in Thailand and Vietnam rose dramatically over the past month. Malaysia is now registering more new infections per million people than any medium- or large-size country in Asia, surpassing India. In Africa, concerns are growing over the possible arrival of a new wave powered by a more transmissible variant of the virus, with the health systems in many countries at risk of being quickly subsumed by a surge of infections. A recent study found that the continent has the world’s highest death rate of patients critically ill with covid-19, thanks to limited intensive care facilities and reserves of vital medical supplies like oxygen. In parts of Latin America, the virus rages on, largely unabated. Peru, according to its own government-adjusted data, now has the worst covid-19 mortality rate per capita in the world. Even in East Asia, where a handful of nations set the gold standard in preventing community spread, the virus is on the march. Taiwan has seen an explosion of cases over the past month. In Japan, which still intends to host the Summer Olympics, numerous areas including Tokyo remain under a state of emergency. Read more here: Washington Post – The pandemic is getting worse, even when it seems like it’s getting better Neil Lancefield, PA Media’s transport correspondent, has some quotes from Tom Bartosak-Harlow from the Confederation of Passenger Transport (CPT) this morning. He’s worried that if face coverings and social distancing requirements continue on public transport in England after they have been dropped in other settings, it will stigmatise the use of buses and trains. He said: We need to see public transport moving at the same pace as the rest of the country. If you no longer have to wear a face covering in certain situations such as hospitality and retail but you do on public transport, we think that would undermine confidence in public transport. If people have this view that going on a bus or a coach carries a greater risk of catching Covid, in the longer term that will encourage people to use their car. Good morning, it is Martin Belam here taking over in London, where this morning the mayor Sadiq Khan has been warning fans of Scottish football not to travel if they don’t have tickets when England and Scotland face each other at Wembley on 18 June. Khan joins the Scottish government and Scottish Football Association (SFA) to ask fans not to travel to the city unless they have a ticket, or a safe place to watch the match. He said: “I am so excited for Euro 2020 and one of the games that I am looking forward to the most is England’s match with Scotland at Wembley. “I have some amazing memories of England v Scotland games in the past and I love the atmosphere that Scottish fans always bring to major football tournaments. “However, I am today urging all fans to only come to London if you have a ticket for the match or if you have arranged a safe place to watch it from, in compliance with Covid-19 guidelines.” He added: “I want to be completely clear that Scottish fans will not be able to access their traditional Trafalgar Square base, as it will be used as a socially-distanced fan zone for key workers who are helping our city through the pandemic. “Due to Covid regulations there are no alternative sites for fans to gather in large numbers in central London.” Here’s how UK media reported the great news on Tuesday of zero Covid-related deaths in the country for the first day since the pandemic began. Many papers suggest that the first day without a single Covid death for 10 months means the complete easing of lockdown restrictions will go ahead in England as planned on 21 June. Mexico has revised its death count, adding 4,272 fatalities. The clinical review of past deaths, by a team of doctors and nurses, is largely a record-keeping exercise, AP reports. Mexico’s government has long acknowledged that the true death toll from the pandemic is far higher than the current total of 227,840, due to low testing capabilities. Many Mexicans have died at home, or never been tested. As well as the medical team-led reviews, another process also provides adjusted figures. The computerised search of death certificates for Covid-related symptoms has suggested more than 350,000 have died, which would give Mexico one of the highest per-capita fatality rates in the world. Reuters: A shipment of coronavirus vaccines to North Korea via the global Covax sharing programme that was expected for late May has been delayed again amid protracted consultations, South Korea’s unification ministry said on Tuesday. Covax, which secures vaccines for poor countries, has said it will provide nearly 2 million doses of AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine to North Korea. “Countries that want Covax support are required to hold various consultations and submit some documents including an inoculation plan,” a ministry official said. “But in North Korea’s case, such consultations have been prolonged and it appears that the shipment will be made later than initially planned.” Insular and secretive North Korea has not commented on any consultations on vaccines. It has not officially confirmed any Covid-19 infections, although Seoul officials have said an outbreak there cannot be ruled out as the North had trade and people-to-people exchanges with China before closing its border early last year. The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) alliance, which co-leads Covax with the World Health Organization (WHO), said work is ongoing and discussions continue with North Korea, but no shipment date was finalised. GAVI said last month that shipments have not been made to North Korea due to its lack of “technical preparedness” and global supply shortages but could be expected later this year. In a statement last week to the ongoing WHO annual assembly, North Korea accused unspecified countries of dominating vaccine supplies and causing a global “bottleneck” due to “national egoism.” “Some countries are procuring and storing the vaccines more than their needs ... when other countries can’t even procure it,” it said. In the last few hours a few countries have reported updated daily case numbers. India has reported 132,788 new cases over the past 24 hours, and an additional 3,207 deaths. Health ministry data says the country’s infection tally is about 28.3 million, with more than 335,000 deaths. In Germany, the Robert Koch Institute has said 4,917 new cases has brought the country’s total to 3,687,828, and an additional 179 fatalities has raised the death toll to 88,774. China has reported 24 new cases, including 10 domestic cases all in Guangdong province where authorities have imposed localised lockdown measures to control an outbreak. It also reported seven asymptomatic cases in Guangdong, which are counted separately. Via AFP: The World Health Organization has approved the Sinovac Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use – the second Chinese vaccine to receive the WHO’s green light. The UN health agency signed off on CoronaVac, a two-dose vaccine developed by the Beijing-based firm which is already being deployed in several countries around the world. The WHO said the emergency use listing (EUL) gives countries, funders, procuring agencies and communities assurance that the vaccine has met international standards. Last month Sinopharm became the first Chinese vaccine to be approved by the WHO. The organisation has also given EUL status to vaccines being made by Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and the AstraZeneca jab being produced in India, South Korea and the EU, which it counts separately. WHO’s listing paves the way for countries worldwide to approve and import a vaccine for distribution quickly, especially those states without an international-standard regulator of their own. It also opens the door for the jabs to enter the Covax global vaccine-sharing facility, which aims to provide equitable access to doses around the world, particularly in poorer countries. Currently only AstraZeneca and some Pfizer jabs are flowing through the scheme. Read more here: Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s continuing rolling coverage of the pandemic. You can catch up on the previous live blog here, or see below for a quick roundup of the past 24 hours. The Australian state of Victoria has extended its lockdown for another seven days as it works to control an outbreak in Melbourne. The UK has enjoyed a day without a single reported Covid death for the first time since the pandemic began. India said it is aiming to triple capacity to 10 million jabs per day by July to avert another wave of Covid-19 infections as deadly as the outbreak suffered since April. A Brazilian Supreme Court judge has given president Jair Bolsonaro five days to submit information regarding the government’s decision to host the Copa America football tournament despite the nation’s ongoing struggles with Covid-19. A decrease in local Covid-19 vaccine production has slowed the pace of Brazil’s inoculation drive and contributed to a growing number of people not taking their second doses, according to the latest data from the Fiocruz biomedical institute. Heathrow airport in London has begun processing arrivals from red list countries in a dedicated terminal following concerns about them mixing with other passengers. Travellers arriving from red list nations on direct flights are being taken to Terminal 3. Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa called on faster delivery of vaccines to poorer countries, including by waiving patents on vaccine development. Peru has revised its official Covid-19 death toll to 180,764, nearly triple the previous official figure of 69,342, following a government review that shows the severity of the outbreak in the country. The World Health Organisation has recommended a new set of names for the coronavirus “variants of concern”, which will be known by letters of the Greek alphabet. Alpha is the new name for UK/Kent (B.1.1.7), Beta for South Africa (B.1.351), Gamma for Brazil (P.1) and Delta for the variant first detected in India (B.1.617.2). Malaysia has begun a tough nationwide lockdown to battle a worsening coronavirus outbreak. Of almost 2,800 deaths from Covid-19 recorded in the country of 32 million since the start of the pandemic, over 40 percent were in May alone. Israel announced it will begin phasing out coronavirus-related payments to the unemployed and Ireland announced similar steps later this year while maintaining other income and business supports as the economy fully reopens. The Coachella music festival will return to the US in April 2022 after being repeatedly delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic, organisers have announced.","charCount":"71443","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/yohannes-lowe\">Yohannes Lowe</a> (now); <a href=\"profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a> and <a href=\"profile/helen-davidson\">Helen Davidson</a> (earlier)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/live/2021/jun/02/joe-biden-republicans-democrats-covid-coronavirus-us-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-02T22:01:58Z","webTitle":"Biden promises ‘summer of freedom’ as he urges more Americans to get vaccinated – live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2021/jun/02/joe-biden-republicans-democrats-covid-coronavirus-us-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/live/2021/jun/02/joe-biden-republicans-democrats-covid-coronavirus-us-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Biden promises ‘summer of freedom’ as he urges more Americans to get vaccinated – live","standfirst":"<ul><li>‘The more people we get vaccinated, the more success we’ll have’</li><li>Trump blog he launched a month ago will not return, adviser says</li><li>Republicans and Democrats at odds over cost of infrastructure bill</li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2018/sep/17/guardian-us-morning-briefing-sign-up-to-stay-informed\">Sign up to receive First Thing – our daily briefing by email</a></li></ul>","trailText":"‘The more people we get vaccinated, the more success we’re going to have,’ president says – follow all the day’s politics news","byline":"Maanvi Singh (now) and Joan E Greve in Washington (earlier)","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"88391a34f332ac8b3d05b82d38153a38f9d5672a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/88391a34f332ac8b3d05b82d38153a38f9d5672a/0_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Biden at the White House on Wednesday.

will be anchored in the South, and the First Lady, the Second Gentleman, and members of the Cabinet will also join the Administration’s tour to communities across the country,” the White House said in

to share vaccine information with their customers.</p> \n  <p>“The ‘Shots at the Shop’ initiative will invite participation from across the country, with a particular focus on supporting shops in some

for governor in her state. </p> \n  <p>Arizona, where<strong> Donald Trump</strong> narrowly lost to <strong>Joe Biden</strong> in November, has become a focal point for conspiracy theorists who falsely believe the election was stolen. After the election, Hobbs beat back baseless claims of fraud and ensured that the state’s presidential electors were certified for Biden to properly reflect the outcome of the popular vote.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/katiehobbs/status/1400093545260752904\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I’m running for Governor to deliver transparency, accountability, and results for Arizonans -- just like I’ve done my whole career.<br><br>Join me: <a href=\"https://t.co/LM2sCDVynA\">https://t.co/LM2sCDVynA</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/5y3QtFvYAk\">pic.twitter.com/5y3QtFvYAk</a></p>— Katie Hobbs (@katiehobbs) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/katiehobbs/status/1400093545260752904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 2, 2021</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>“We had a job to do, and that job was simple: Count every vote.

But there’s a third option: Get the job done,” Hobbs said. “The other side isn’t offering policies to make our lives better. They’re offering conspiracies that only make our lives worse.”</p> \n  <p>In recent months, Hobbs, elected to her office in 2018, has taken on a leading role in monitoring and calling out a GOP-led review of 2.1m ballots cast in Maricopa county, the most populous in Arizona. </p> \n  <p>She has <a href=\"https://azsos.gov/sites/default/files/5.5.21_letter_to_ken_bennett.pdf\">drawn attention</a> to shoddy practices auditors are using and monitors deployed by her office have regularly noted significant problems in procedures.

The details revealed by her office have underscore how unprofessional the audit is.</p> \n  <p>Hobbs’ entrance in the governor’s race will likely bring even more attention to who her successor will be. <strong>Mark Finchem</strong>, an Arizona legislator who is a prominent advocate of the Stop the Steal movement, is already seeking the Republican nomination.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-60b7a56d8f082ac930ae821a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-02T15:41:28.153Z\">4.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>House speaker <strong>Nancy Pelosi </strong>has reportedly told <strong>Democrats </strong>that multiple options remain to launch an expansive review of the Capitol insurrection, after Senate <strong>Republicans </strong>killed the bill to form a bipartisan commission to study the attack.</p> \n  <p>NBC News <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/pelosi-details-next-steps-jan-6-investigation-after-senate-filibusters-n1269313\">reports</a>:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> During a conference call with members of the House Democratic Caucus, Pelosi detailed options, including the potential the Senate could vote a second time and try to overcome the Republican filibuster, according to two sources who were on the call.<br></p> \n   <p>She shot down a suggestion raised by some House Democrats that President <strong>Joe Biden</strong> could form a presidential commission, calling it not a workable idea, one source on the call said.</p> \n   <p>A presidential commission would need Congress to grant subpoena power and allocate funding.

The president did not take questions from reporters following the meeting. Capito, of West Virginia, has been leading Republicans’ talks with the Biden administration. But it’s unclear whether the two parties can reach a compromise on infrastructure. Republicans responded to Democrats’ sweeping $1.7tn proposal with a $928bn counteroffer. Opposing the Democrats’ proposed increase of corporate tax rate to at from 21% to at least 25%, Republicans instead suggested that their plan could be funded by repurposing coronavirus relief funds. Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats would seek to pass an infrastructure bill with or without Republican support this summer. Susan, a former employee for the crime app Citizen, applied for a job curating the platform’s content and notifications in 2019 “in a pinch”. She had a writing background, was having trouble finding work in New York City, and thought she could make some money while looking for a better fit. By the time she left less than a year later, Susan said, she was drinking to excess because of work stress, had trouble sleeping and had, at one point, cracked her tooth clenching her jaw while listening to hours of talking on the police scanner. As her mental health declined, her bosses at Citizen were not supportive, Susan said. “They don’t even know what is going on in our ears,” said Susan, who the Guardian is identifying by a pseudonym due to fear of repercussions from the company. She recalled feeling regularly pressured to keep up appearances, despite the increasingly distressing content workers like her were moderating. “The job is akin to most internet moderation, but in some ways it is worse because you are looking at videos directly from the scene of a bloody crash, often near where you live,” she said. “You are listening to the most insane shit.” Citizen uses location data to feed millions of users local crime information that it collects via police scanners. The app made headlines earlier this month for offering $30,000 to anyone who could find a man accused of starting a California wildfire, raising a number of ethical concerns. But former employees say the episode is far from the only troubling one at the company, and that the startup has long been a toxic place to work. “The job is very hard, it’s very traumatic, and it takes a lot of skilled labor,” Susan said. “It attracts a creative, smart, empathetic person. But there is a disconnect between that and the bosses who don’t appear to care about our wellbeing at all.” Citizen disputes the claims. “Our employees are our lifeblood,” a Citizen spokesperson said, adding that the company “takes great care to prioritize their health and wellbeing”. Read more: NAACP president Derrick Johnson will meet with West Virginia senator and key Democratic holdout on a sweeping voting rights measure Joe Manchin. Johnson, who is set to meet with Manchin next Tuesday, along with representatives of other voting rights groups, said he “looks forward to a robust and productive conversation”. “We must do everything we can to protect the American people’s sacred right to participate in the democratic process. Our vote is our voice, and we will not be silenced,” the NAACP said. Manchin has called the Democratic For the People Act “too darn broad” and partisan. The sweeping bill would expand ballot access, nullify some voting restrictions enacted by Republicans, and establish support for District of Columbia statehood, among other things. The centrist senator has also been one of the top defenders of the filibuster, a procedural obstacle that makes it impossible to pass most bills through the Senate without a 60-vote supermajority. Even if Machin voted for the Democrats’ voting rights bill, with the filibuster in place, in an evenly divided chamber, the party would have to win over at least 10 Republicans in order to pass the legislation – something that’s highly unlikely to ever happen. That’s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here’s where the day stands so far: Joe Biden promised Americans a “summer of freedom” as he urged more people to get vaccinated against coronavirus. Announcing his administration’s “month of action” to increase coronavirus vaccinations by July 4, Biden said, “America is heading into a summer dramatically different from last year’s summer. A summer of freedom. A summer of joy. A summer of get-togethers and celebrations. An all-American summer that this country deserves after a long, long dark winter that we have all endured.” Biden has set a goal of having 70% of American adults at least partially vaccinated by July 4. Biden met with Shelley Moore Capito to discuss Senate Republicans’ latest infrastructure proposal. The president and Capito, who is leading the Republican negotiating team, discussed the state of infrastructure negotiations for about an hour. The meeting comes almost a week after Capito and her group called for spending $928 billion on infrastructure over the next eight years, far less than what Biden has proposed. The Israeli opposition leader has told the country’s president that he can form a government. The announcement from Yair Lapid marks a crucial step toward bringing an end to 12 years of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s leadership, but lawmakers still have to vote on the deal, which may happen as soon as next week. The White House said Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin will discuss recent ransomware attacks on major companies when they meet in Switzerland later this month. Administration officials have previously indicated that they believe the attacks on Colonial Pipeline and JBS were carried out by criminal groups based in Russia. “President Biden certainly thinks Putin and the Russian government have a role to play in stopping these attacks,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said. Donald Trump shuttered his blog, “From the Desk of Donald J. Trump,” after less than a month. According to the Washington Post, the former president was displeased by the blog’s low readership numbers and the ridicule it attracted after debuting last month. Maanvi will have more coming up, so stay tuned. The step by Yair Lapid does not immediately end Benjamin Netanyahu’s 12-year stretch in power or conclude a political deadlock that has brought four snap elections since 2019. Before that happens, lawmakers will need to vote on the deal, which is expected next week. Then there will be a swearing-in. Until that happens, Netanyahu is expected to continue his attempts to get any lawmakers to defect so Lapid does not have a 61-seat majority in the 120-seat Knesset. Under the proposed deal, Lapid will not immediately take high office. Instead, his political rival and far-right politician Naftali Bennett, whose support was vital to the coalition’s success, will become prime minister for the first two years. The Israeli opposition leader has told the country’s president that he can form a government, a critical step that places Benjamin Netanyahu in his most precarious political position for more than a decade. After days of frenetic negotiations, Yair Lapid told President Reuven Rivlin on Wednesday that he has the support of a majority of opposition parties for what has been dubbed a “government of change” – a mix of bitter ideological rivals united by a shared desire to oust Israel’s longest-serving leader. “I am honoured to inform you that I have succeeded in forming a government,” Lapid told the president in a letter. He added: “I commit to you Mr President, that this government will work to serve all the citizens of Israel including those who aren’t members of it, will respect those who oppose it, and do everything in its power to unite all parts of Israeli society.” Crucially, Lapid secured backing from powerful far-right Jewish politicians, but also a small party of Arab Islamists who signed roughly two hours before the deadline. In doing so, the United Arab List became the first party from the country’s sizeable Arab minority to ever join a government. Its leader, Mansour Abbas, is a pragmatist and has sought greater resources and rights for Palestinian citizens of Israel. Joe and Jill Biden will soon leave Washington to spend a couple of days at their Rehoboth Beach home, where they will celebrate the first lady’s 70th birthday. The AP reports: President Joe Biden and his wife were heading to their Delaware beach house Wednesday evening to help the first lady celebrate that personal milestone on Thursday. The trip makes for a rare midweek getaway from the White House by a president. It will also be the president’s first visit to the couple’s Rehoboth Beach home since he took office in January. The Bidens were expected to be back at the White House on Friday. A Daily Mail reporter noted today that Biden-inspired artwork has been popping up in the Rehoboth Beach area, where the first family has owned a house since 2017. Joe Biden’s meeting with Republican Senator Shelley Moore Capito to discuss a potential infrastructure deal concluded after about an hour. The press was not allowed into the meeting, but the White House will likely soon release a readout of the discussion between the president and Capito, who is leading the Republican negotiating team. Stay tuned. Erin McCormick reports for the Guardian from Berkeley, California: Rural northern California is seeing a troubling rise in Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations, an alarming trend that comes as residents and businesses continue to protest against safety measures and vaccinations – with one Mendocino cafe threatening to charge customers $5 for wearing a mask. While the region makes up a small proportion of the state’s population, the growth in its caseload has been considerable, and comes at a time when the state overall is enjoying some of the lowest rates of Covid in the country. After largely avoiding the worst of the pandemic, a block of far northern California counties now leads the state with nearly 40 cases per 100,000 residents over the past week, according to statistics maintained by the Los Angeles Times. Tehama county ranked the highest in the LA Times case ratings with 139 cases per 100,000 residents. Meanwhile 10 of the 21 total Covid deaths in nearby Siskiyou county have occurred since the beginning of May. The region has long been one of the most forceful in its pushback against measures such as masks, business restrictions and vaccine mandates – and the protests have only continued to gain steam. A cafe in the town of Mendocino made headlines after announcing it will charge customers a $5 fee if they order while wearing a mask. It also threatened to charge $5 to anyone “caught bragging about your vaccine”. Donald Trump ordered his blog shuttered because of its poor readership and the ridicule it was attracting, one adviser to the former president told the Washington Post. The Post reports: Former president Donald Trump’s blog, celebrated by advisers as a ‘beacon of freedom’ that would keep him relevant in an online world he once dominated, is dead. It was 29 days old. Upset by reports from The Washington Post and other outlets highlighting its measly readership and concerns that it could detract from a social media platform he wants to launch later this year, Trump ordered his team Tuesday to put the blog out of its misery, advisers said. On its last day, the site received just 1,500 shares or comments on Facebook and Twitter — a staggering drop for someone whose every tweet once garnered hundreds of thousands of reactions. Trump still wants to launch some other platform — timing not yet determined — and didn’t like that this first attempt was being mocked as a loser, according to a Trump adviser who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk frankly about the former president’s plans. The blog was clearly meant to help Trump amplify his political message after he was suspended from Twitter and Facebook for inciting the January 6 insurrection. However, the page did not have the kind of interactive features available on all major social media platforms, so users were unable to directly respond to Trump’s statements. That unsuccessful dynamic seems to have led to the blog’s early demise. Joe Biden’s meeting with Republican Senator Shelley Moore Capito has now started, according to the latest White House press pool report. The president and the senator are expected to discuss the latest infrastructure offer from Capito and her group of fellow Republicans, who have been negotiating with the White House in recent weeks. Republicans have proposed spending $928 billion on infrastructure over the next eight years. However, only $257 billion in that proposal is considered new funds; the rest is baseline spending, meaning money that was already going to be used on infrastructure projects because of existing policies. In contrast, Biden has proposed spending $1.7 trillion over baseline spending levels on infrastructure. So the two sides remain far apart in their negotiations, and this meeting will likely determine whether any bipartisan deal can be reached. Following on from news out of the White House press conference earlier that Joe Biden will directly bring up with Vladimir Putin of Russia the subject of ransomware attacks on US entities perpetrated by Russian criminal gangs, there was a shouted question at the end of the US president’s address on Covid-19. The G7 meeting begins in the UK mid-month. It’s been a lively morning in US political news and there’s more to come so do stay tuned. Joe Biden is meeting at the White House now with West Virginia Republican Senator Shelley Moore Capito in a late push for a bipartisan deal on infrastructure legislation. Here are the other main events of the day so far: US president Joe Biden touts the prospect of a “summer of freedom” but urges those reluctant to get vaccinated against coronavirus. Biden will directly discuss the rash of ransomware cyber attacks on US entities, from local government computer systems, to a gas pipeline to the biggest US meat processing company, when he meets with Russian president Vladimir Putin at the upcoming G7 talks in Britain. Donald Trump has shuttered the blog that he started less than a month ago, a senior adviser to the former president said. Katie Hobbs, Arizona’s top election official who became one of the leading voices beating back conspiracies about the 2020 election, announced she was seeking the Democratic nomination for governor in her state. Joe Biden outlined his administration’s new efforts to make it easier than ever for Americans to get their coronavirus vaccinations. Among other initiatives, four of the largest US childcare providers will offer free childcare for caregivers who are getting the vaccine or recovering after their shot. Pharmacy chains across the country, including Albertsons, CVS, Rite-Aid and Walgreens, will also offer extended hours from now until July 4 to make it easier to get vaccinated. The president emphasized that the vaccines will allow Americans to enjoy a summer where they can safely gather with loved ones without fear of the virus. “America is heading into a summer dramatically different from last year’s summer,” Biden said. “A summer of freedom. A summer of joy. A summer of get-togethers and celebrations. An all-American summer that this country deserves after a long, long dark winter that we have all endured.” Biden also noted that Americans are lucky to have such easy access to the vaccines, saying, “All over the world, people are desperate to get a shot that every American can get at their neighborhood drugstore.” Joe Biden emphasized that getting vaccinated is not a “partisan act,” encouraging Americans of all political leanings to get their shots. The president also specifically urged younger Americans to get their vaccines, as their vaccination rates have lagged behind those of older Americans. “We need people under 40 to step up,” Biden said. Joe Biden is now delivering remarks at the White House to outline his administration’s planned efforts over the next month to get more Americans vaccinated against coronavirus. The Biden administration announced this morning that it is launching a “month of action” to encourage Americans to get vaccinated. Among other initiatives, the month of action includes a nationwide tour by Kamala Harris and a partnership with Black-owned barbershops and beauty salons to spread information about vaccines. The president noted that 52% of American adults are now fully vaccinated. He has set a goal of having 70% of American adults at least partially vaccinated by July 4. “It’s clearer than ever — the more people we get vaccinated, the more success we’re going to have in our fight against this virus,” Biden said. Jen Psaki told reporters that at least some of Joe Biden’s afternoon meeting with Republican Senator Shelley Moore Capito to discuss infrastructure negotiations would be one-on-one, without additional staffers present. The White House press secretary’s briefing has now ended, and Biden will soon deliver an update on the country’s vaccine distribution efforts. His administration has already announced a “month of action” to get more Americans vaccinated before July 4. Jen Psaki said that Vice-President Kamala Harris requested to become the Biden administration’s point person on strengthening voting rights in the US. “She actually asked to run point and lead on voting rights,” the White House press secretary said. Joe Biden announced yesterday that Harris would take the lead on voting rights initiatives as congressional Democrats work to advance the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. “I’m asking Vice President Harris to help these efforts and lead them, among her many other responsibilities,” Biden said in Tulsa. “With her leadership and your support, we’re going to overcome again, I promise you. But it’s going to take a hell of a lot of work.” The announcement came as Republican legislators in dozens of states advance bills that would restrict voting access, as the Guardian’s Sam Levine has extensively reported on. Jen Psaki appeared to downplay Joe Biden’s veiled criticism of Democratic senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema in his speech yesterday on the Tulsa race massacre. Commemorating the 100th anniversary of the massacre in Tulsa, the president touched on the hurdles in advancing his legislative agenda because of Democrats’ narrow majorities in both chambers of Congress. “I hear all the folks on TV saying, ‘Why doesn’t Biden get this done?’” the president told the Tulsa crowd. “Well, because Biden only has a majority of, effectively, four votes in the House and a tie in the Senate, with two members of the Senate who vote more with my Republican friends.” The White House press secretary claimed that Biden’s comment was only meant to reflect the difficulty of discussing complex policy negotiations in a television format. “I don’t think he was intending to convey anything other than a little bit of commentary on TV punditry,” Psaki said. Jen Psaki was asked about the ransomware attack on the meat-processing company JBS, which forced its US factories to halt operations. The incident came weeks after another ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline disrupted gasoline supply in several east-coast states. The White House previously said the hackers were most likely a criminal group based in Russia, and Psaki said Joe Biden will discuss recent cyber attacks when he meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin in two weeks. “President Biden certainly thinks Putin and the Russian government have a role to play in stopping these attacks,” Psaki said. The White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, is now holding her daily briefing with reporters. Psaki opened the briefing by reiterating the administration’s announcement that it is launching a “month of action” to get more Americans vaccinated by July 4. The month of action will involve an “all of America sprint” to reach Joe Biden’s goal of having 70% of American adults at least partially vaccinated by July 4, Psaki said. As of today, 63% of American adults have received at least one coronavirus vaccine dose, according to the White House. The Biden administration has announced a new series of initiatives aimed at encouraging more Americans to get vaccinated against coronavirus, as the president looks to have 70% of Americans at least partially vaccinated by July 4. The White House announced that four of largest US childcare providers will offer free childcare for caregivers who are getting the vaccine or recovering after their shot. Pharmacy chains across the country, including Albertsons, CVS, Rite-Aid and Walgreens, will also offer extended hours from now until July 4 to make it easier to get vaccinated. Vice-President Kamala Harris is launching a “nation-wide tour to reach millions of Americans who still need protection against the virus”. “The Vice President’s travel will be anchored in the South, and the First Lady, the Second Gentleman, and members of the Cabinet will also join the Administration’s tour to communities across the country,” the White House said in its factsheet about the new initiatives. The administration is also partnering with Black-owned barbershops and beauty salons to start “Shots at the Shop,” which will allow the businesses to share vaccine information with their customers. “The ‘Shots at the Shop’ initiative will invite participation from across the country, with a particular focus on supporting shops in some of the hardest-hit localities still experiencing significant gaps in vaccination rates,” the White House said. Joe Biden will likely tout all these new developments when he delivers an update on vaccine distribution efforts this afternoon. The Guardian’s Sam Levine reports: Katie Hobbs, Arizona’s top election official who became one of the leading voices beating back conspiracies about the 2020 election, announced Wednesday she was seeking the Democratic nomination for governor in her state. Arizona, where Donald Trump narrowly lost to Joe Biden in November, has become a focal point for conspiracy theorists who falsely believe the election was stolen. After the election, Hobbs beat back baseless claims of fraud and ensured that the state’s presidential electors were certified for Biden to properly reflect the outcome of the popular vote. “We had a job to do, and that job was simple: Count every vote. When you’re under attack, some would have you believe you have two choices: To fight or give in. But there’s a third option: Get the job done,” Hobbs said. “The other side isn’t offering policies to make our lives better. They’re offering conspiracies that only make our lives worse.” In recent months, Hobbs, elected to her office in 2018, has taken on a leading role in monitoring and calling out a GOP-led review of 2.1m ballots cast in Maricopa county, the most populous in Arizona. She has drawn attention to shoddy practices auditors are using and monitors deployed by her office have regularly noted significant problems in procedures. A compilation of notes published by Hobbs’ office on Tuesday, for example, detail security lapses, technological glitches, and confusion about who is in charge. The details revealed by her office have underscore how unprofessional the audit is. Hobbs’ entrance in the governor’s race will likely bring even more attention to who her successor will be. Mark Finchem, an Arizona legislator who is a prominent advocate of the Stop the Steal movement, is already seeking the Republican nomination. House speaker Nancy Pelosi has reportedly told Democrats that multiple options remain to launch an expansive review of the Capitol insurrection, after Senate Republicans killed the bill to form a bipartisan commission to study the attack. NBC News reports: During a conference call with members of the House Democratic Caucus, Pelosi detailed options, including the potential the Senate could vote a second time and try to overcome the Republican filibuster, according to two sources who were on the call. She shot down a suggestion raised by some House Democrats that President Joe Biden could form a presidential commission, calling it not a workable idea, one source on the call said. A presidential commission would need Congress to grant subpoena power and allocate funding. Both chambers would have to vote to approve, which looks unlikely after the Senate Republicans’ filibuster last week. Republicans successfully blocked the commission bill from advancing last week, after only six Republican senators voted with Democrats to start debate on the legislation. Democrats needed 10 Republican votes to overcome the filibuster of the bill. The US secretary of state has warned leaders of Pacific countries about “threats to the rules-based international order” and “economic coercion”, in what appears to be a veiled swipe at China’s growing influence in the region. Antony Blinken was addressing leaders and their delegates from 11 Pacific countries and territories including Fiji, Solomon Islands, Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, French Polynesia, Palau and Marshall Islands as part of the Pacific Islands Conference of Leaders, which is held in Hawaii. Blinken reiterated US support for Pacific island nations as they face the “shared challenges that we have to confront together”, including Covid-19 and the climate crisis. But the main focus of his televised address was China’s growing influence in the region. “Economic coercion across the region is on the rise. The US is all for more development and investment in the islands, but that investment should adhere to international standards for environmentally and socially sustainable development and should be pursued transparently, with public consultation,” he said. “And every country, no matter its size, should always be able to make choices without fear of retribution.” The CDC’s decision to loosen mask requirements has not led to any noticeable increase in the spread of coronavirus, as the number of new cases in the US has continued to fall in the past few weeks. Meanwhile, the number of first-shot vaccine appointments has leveled off in recent weeks after a worrisome decline in the month leading up to the mask announcement. The New York Times explains: First, new Covid cases have continued to decline at virtually the same rate as during the month before the C.D.C. announcement, which came on May 13 ... Overall, daily new cases have fallen by almost 75 percent since mid-April and by more than 90 percent from the peak in January. ... On the other hand, the C.D.C.’s change has had a noticeable effect on behavior in a positive way. ... For the previous month, the number of daily shots in the U.S. had been falling, as the country began to run out of adults who were eager to be vaccinated. With a few days of the mask announcement, the decline leveled off. The White House shared the New York Times piece in an email with reporters, and Joe Biden will likely tout the encouraging trends when he delivers an update on vaccination efforts this afternoon. Donald Trump has shuttered the blog that he started less than a month ago, a senior adviser to the former president said. Jason Miller told CNBC that the page “From the Desk of Donald J. Trump” had been deleted from the former president’s website and “will not be returning”. “It was just auxiliary to the broader efforts we have and are working on,” Miller said in an email to CNBC. “Hoping to have more information on the broader efforts soon, but I do not have a precise awareness of timing.” The blog, which debuted last month, was a clear effort by Trump to amplify his message despite his social media bans, which were put in place after he incited the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol. However, the blog never gained much traction, in part because of readers’ inability to reply to Trump’s statements, as they would do on Twitter or Facebook. Twitter also suspended an account that pulled content from Trump’s blog, @DJTDesk, because the social media company said it violated the platform’s ban evasion policy. Portable microwave weapons capable of causing the mysterious spate of “Havana Syndrome” brain injuries in US diplomats and spies have been developed by several countries in recent years, according to leading American experts in the field. A US company also made the prototype of such a weapon for the marine corps in 2004. The weapon, codenamed Medusa, was intended to be small enough to fit in a car, and cause a “temporarily incapacitating effect” but “with a low probability of fatality or permanent injury”. There is no evidence that the research was taken beyond the prototype phase, and a report on that stage has been removed from a US navy website. Scientists with knowledge of the project said that ethical considerations preventing human experimentation contributed to the project being shelved – but they said such consideration had not hindered US adversaries, including Russia, and possibly China. “The state of that science has for the most part been, if not abandoned, pretty much left fallow in the United States – but it has not been fallow elsewhere,” said James Giordano, professor of neurology and ethics at Georgetown University Medical Center. In case you missed it last night: A Democratic candidate won the special election to fill Interior Secretary Deb Haaland’s open House seat. Democratic state legislator Melanie Stansbury defeated Republican state senator Mark Moores by about 25 points, delivering a resounding victory for Democrats after the party’s poor performance in a Texas special election last month. Delivering a victory speech in Albuquerque, Stansbury said, “This moment is not just about standing up, but about leaning into the moment and bringing fundamental change to our politics and to our country.” Stansbury’s win will help to slightly bolster Democrats’ very narrow majority in the House. Once Stansbury is seated to represent New Mexico’s 1st District, Democrats will have a 220-211 advantage over Republicans. The margin of Stansbury’s victory was also encouraging to Democrats, given that Joe Biden carried the New Mexico district by 23 points in November. Haaland also won reelection to her seat by 16 points last year. Stansbury’s ability to improve upon Biden and Haaland’s numbers gave some Democrats hope that they can hold off a wave of Republican victories in next year’s midterms. However, the midterms are still about a year and a half away, so time will tell. The Guardian’s Sam Levine reports: For nearly five months, Democrats in state legislatures across the country have been scraping to do everything they can to stop an unprecedented onslaught of new voting restrictions from Republicans. They have given searing speeches on the floors of state legislatures. They have supported protests and even gotten arrested demonstrating against the bills. They have filed lawsuits challenging new restrictions almost immediately after they were signed into law. But despite their efforts, Democrats have not been able to stop sweeping new voting restrictions from going into place in states such as Arizona, Georgia, Florida, Iowa and Montana, where Republicans have used their legislative majorities to ram through the bills. But late on Sunday night something different happened in Texas. With Republicans on the verge of passing one of the most restrictive new voting laws in the country, Democrats in the state house of representatives walked out of the legislature, denying Republicans a quorum and killing the legislation. Governor Greg Abbott has fumed over the development and has pledged to call a special session to pass the bill. Be sure to read the fine print on the Anheuser-Busch vaccine giveaway: only 200,000 participants will get money to buy a free round after the US hits Joe Biden’s vaccination goal. And it may be a round for one person, as the beer company is only giving winners a $5.00 virtual debit card to purchase an Anheuser-Busch product. Those who want the chance to win one of the debit cards will also have to create a My Cooler Rewards account and upload a “picture of your favorite place to grab a beer”. Joe Biden will also deliver an update this afternoon on his administration’s efforts to get Americans vaccinated against coronavirus. The speech comes one month before July 4, Biden’s deadline to get 70% of American adults at least partially vaccinated for US Independence Day. The president is expected to announce a new partnership between the White House and the beer company Anheuser-Busch to encourage Americans to get their vaccines. The CEO of Anheuser-Busch said in an announcement this morning that the company will “buy Americans 21+ a round of beer when we reach the White House goal”. “We pride ourselves on stepping up both in times of need and in times of great celebration, and the past year has been no different,” said CEO Michel Doukeris. “As we look ahead to brighter days with renewed optimism, we are proud to work alongside the White House to make a meaningful impact for our country, our communities and our consumers.” The “Let’s Grab A Beer” initiative is only the latest in a string of US efforts to incentivize vaccinations. Perhaps most notably, the state of Ohio has been distributing $1 million lottery prizes to a handful of new vaccine recipients. Greetings from Washington, live blog readers. Joe Biden will meet this afternoon with Shelley Moore Capito, the senator who has been leading the Republican team negotiating with the White House over a potential infrastructure bill. The meeting comes almost one week after Capito and her fellow Republicans introduced their latest counteroffer, which proposed spending $928 billion for infrastructure projects over the next eight years. That offer was still a far cry from what Biden has called for spending. Of the $928 billion in Republicans’ plan, only $257 billion is considered new money, while the rest was baselines spending, meaning the funds that were already going to be used on infrastructure projects over the next eight years because of existing policies. In contrast, the president has proposed investing $1.7 trillion over baseline infrastructure spending, which is still less than the $2.25 trillion that he originally called for. So Democrats and Republicans remain miles apart on infrastructure, and Biden has signaled that he is ready for the negotiations to come to a close. “I told [Capito] we have to finish this really soon,” Biden said last Thursday. “We’re going to have to close this down soon.” The blog will have more details on the meeting coming up, so stay tuned.","charCount":"35331","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/maanvi-singh\">Maanvi Singh</a> (now) and <a href=\"profile/joan-greve\">Joan E Greve</a> in Washington (earlier)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2021/jun/02/england-v-austria-england-player-ratings-from-the-friendly-win-over-austria","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-02T21:40:53Z","webTitle":"England player ratings from the friendly win over Austria","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/jun/02/england-v-austria-england-player-ratings-from-the-friendly-win-over-austria","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2021/jun/02/england-v-austria-england-player-ratings-from-the-friendly-win-over-austria","fields":{"headline":"England player ratings from the friendly win over Austria","standfirst":"<p>Jack Grealish was the standout and Jesse Lingard also shone despite being left out of England’s final squad for Euro 2020</p>","trailText":"Jack Grealish was England’s creative standout and Jesse Lingard also shone despite being left out of England’s final squad for Euro 2020","byline":"Jacob Steinberg","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cddc89fcf91c6872577312474196720416f84907\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cddc89fcf91c6872577312474196720416f84907/0_116_4931_2958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jack Grealish battles for possession with Aleksander Dragovic of Austria.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jack Grealish battles for possession with Aleksander Dragovic of Austria.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eddie Keogh - The FA/The FA/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p><strong>Jordan Pickford</strong> (GK) Denied Baumgartner and Sabitzer.

After which, it’s just a matter of waiting for the big one against Croatia the following weekend. We’ve waited so long, but Euro 2020 is finally on the horizon. Thanks for reading this MBM. Nighty night. His interview with ITV continues: “I thought we started very well, I thought we used the ball well in the first hour. We were playing against a very good team with some very good players, Alaba, Sabitzer, who get in between the lines. After that, we needed to make a lot of changes and got a bit disjointed. We were hanging on at the end, but that was understandable given the amount of changes we needed to make.” Gareth Southgate reports on Trent Alexander-Arnold’s injury: “We’re going to have a little look. It’s obviously not good to see him come off in the way he did. We’re just going to have to assess him in the next 24 hours. I think it’s a thigh injury, but the medical team are assessing him. We just have to see. It’s not a good sign to see him walk off as he did, but will know more in the next 24 or 48 hours. Let’s see how Trent is, and we’ll go from there. We don’t know the full extent.” Gareth Southgate will hopefully be talking to ITV soon enough. But in lieu of that, here’s David Hytner’s match report, hot from the Riverside. There were also the usual injury worries for Jack Grealish, who sat in the dugout with an icepack on his leg after coming off. But he looked much more comfortable, happy even, and he tells ITV that, yes, it was a pre-emptive measure. “It’s been a great few days. Being announced in the final squad was what I’ve worked for all season. That was my aim. I’ve had an injury recently so to get 70 minutes under my belt was a perfect week. It’s not shin splints, it’s a bit of stress on my shin, a different type of injury. I’m not concerned. I still need to keep on top of it, to heal it after the games, so that’s why I put the ice on it.” Trent Alexander-Arnold had played pretty well up until that point, showcasing plenty of defensive resilience, as well as his trademark range of passing. But that looked like he’s pulled something, and he’s being helped down the tunnel very gingerly indeed. He looks distressed, and ITV are speculating that he muttered something along the lines of “it’s gone” to the physio. If that’s true, it’s a dismal way for this long-running will-he-won’t-he saga to end. England will be keeping the collective fingers crossed. One last chance for Gregoritsch, who heads harmlessly wide from six yards, and Bukayo Saka’s goal has decided it! 90 min +2: Pickford punches a high ball clear. Not particularly well, it has to be said. Grillitsch returns it with feeling. White has dropped back and clears off the line. 90 min +1: Alexander-Arnold, looking dazed and distraught, is helped around the perimeter by an England physio. It doesn’t look good for one of England’s four right-backs. 90 min: There will be three added minutes. 89 min: With England minds elsewhere, a ball’s whipped in from the right. Gregoritsch flashes a header wide from six yards. Meanwhile Alexander-Arnold finally hobbles off, holding his left thigh. Are his Euros over before they’ve begun? It could be a sad, premature end to this long-running soap-opera. 88 min: Now he’s booked for ... well, what, exactly? Going off the pitch and coming back on without permission, possibly. Anyway, he’s still hobbling around. 87 min: Alexander-Arnold is in trouble here. He looks to have tweaked something while making a clearance. 86 min: Hinteregger is booked for giving the referee pelters over a nothing challenge in the middle of the park. 84 min: The slew of substitutions has seriously compromised this as a spectacle. Still, a warm-up’s a warm-up’s a warm-up. 82 min: The international rugby feel of this second half continues apace. Trimmel and Baumgartlinger replace Lainer and Schlager. 80 min: Some space for Friedl on the left. His low cross is no good. But Austria come again, the dangerous Sabitzer looking for the bottom right from distance. Pickford does well to get down and parry. 79 min: Austria paint some pretty triangles, but go absolutely nowhere in doing so. 77 min: Calvert-Lewin drives down the right and looks for Watkins in the middle. Nothing quite comes off. White has a crack from distance, but there’s to be no fairytale for the debutant. 76 min: Grealish has some ice on his shin, though he looks pretty relaxed as he sits draped like a dandy over the dugout seats, the Riverside as chaise lounge. 74 min: Schaub whips the corner in from the right, high and hard. It misses everyone and isn’t too far away from nestling into the top left. The ball flies wide for a goal kick. Just. Calvert-Lewin, Godfrey and Pickford all left that to each other. The departure of Carlo Ancelotti must have hit everyone at Goodison very hard, if the last 12 minutes are anything to go by. Very strange. 73 min: Friedl brings a long Austrian passing move to an end by looking for the top right from the edge of the box. Deflected. Corner. 72 min: Austria respond by replacing Alaba and Kalajdzic with Schaub and Gregoritsch. 71 min: England make another change, swapping Grealish for White in order to shore up the old midfield. 69 min: Grealish grooves his way down the left and whistles a clever low ball across the front of the six-yard box. Calvert-Lewin is on the back foot, and can’t react in time. That was on a plate. 68 min: Tell you what, factor in the Mings challenge on Kalajdzic, and England have got away with a couple here tonight. 66 min: Here’s another Everton sub nearly meeting a date with infamy. Calvert-Lewin is booked for a wholly preposterous challenge on Dargovic, leaping so high into the air he plants his knee on his opponent’s ear! You’d see many a referee brandishing red for that. 65 min: Amid all that kerfuffle, Austria made two subs, replacing Baumgartner and Laimer with Grillitsch and Schaub. 64 min: England’s goal is again under threat, as Sabitzer, just to the right of the D, wedges a curler towards the top left. Pickford gets a light fingertip to it, and the ball caroms off the bar. 63 min: Godfrey’s very first touch nearly ends in high farce, as his heavy backpass, played blind, nearly deceives his Everton team-mate Pickford. It’s rolling into the bottom right, and the keeper does the young defender a huge favour by hooking clear. 62 min: England make a quadruple substitution. Off go Lingard, Kane, Rice and the naughty Mings; on come Calvert-Lewin, Watkins, Ward-Prowse and Godfrey. 60 min: Austria aren’t taking this lying down, though, and Sabitzer has a crack from 25 yards. His effort, destined for the bottom left, is deflected wide of the post. England deal with the corner in a fairly fuss-free fashion. 58 min: Grealish, Kane, Lingard and Saka can all be very proud of that goal. A lovely sweeping move that ripped Austria in half. England were huffing and puffing a bit, but suddenly they click into gear. Grealish picks up on a loose ball and sends Kane away down the inside-left channel. Kane slips back infield. Lingard tees it up for Grealish, who can’t quite get to the ball, sitting on the penalty spot, but the ball breaks left to Saka, who steers into an empty net. Lovely team goal, much of it about Grealish. 55 min: Trippier’s flat delivery fails to beat the first man. Very poor. Austria try to launch a counter, but Friedl is stopped making hay up the left by Bellingham, who has covered plenty of grass tonight on debut. 54 min: Trippier barges his way down the left only to be checked. Another free kick, another opportunity to load the box. This is effectively take two. 53 min: Saka whips it in. With Coady winding his neck back, Lainer is forced to eyebrow out for a corner on the right. Alexander-Arnold takes long. Coady goes for it again, and once more comes off second best. Austria clear. 52 min: Saka makes good down the left and is cynically clipped by Lainer. Yellow card, free kick, and a chance to load the box. 51 min: As the post-half-time lull continues, here’s James Cox’s succinct verdict on the return of fans to England games for the first time since 2019: “NO BAND!!! YEY!” Speaking for many there, I’ll be bound. 49 min: It’s not quite got started, this second half, although Austria look slightly livelier too. 47 min: England buzz about in the performative manner, while the Riverside gives it plenty. England get the second half underway. No changes yet. Mings is still on the field, incidentally, something that’s probably worth underlining in the wake of this first-half snippet ... Half-time capsule review. Ahead of the Euros, a heads-up for Euro Summits: The Story of the European Championship by Jonathan O’Brien, a Homeric 60-year odyssey across 15 tournaments. Breezy yet comprehensive, fun but authoritative, think of it as a perfect companion piece for Cris Freddi’s famous Complete Book of the World Cup, and I can’t think of praise too much higher than that. England started brightly before slipping into neutral. Austria grew into it. For what it’s worth, the visitors will be the slightly happier of the two teams going off. 45 min: There will be one extra minute before the inevitable tranche of substitutions are made. 44 min: Bachmann takes his own sweet time over a garden-variety clearance, and is nearly closed down by Kane. He gets out of trouble by half-executing a drag back, throwing the shape but not connecting with the ball. Fortunately for the Austrian keeper, it’s enough to sell Kane a dummy and he can clear. But dear oh dear. 42 min: Alaba curls the corner into the mixer. Pickford rises highest and punches away confidently. As he naturally falls back to the ground, he picks up a free kick just for being a keeper, you know how these things go sometimes. 41 min: Baumgartner is looking lively now. He sashays down the inside-left channel. Nobody makes a challenge until he reaches the edge of the six-yard box. Mings slides in as Baumgartner shoots. He tackles the ball up onto his own arm. The Austrian wants a penalty; he’s just getting a corner. 39 min: By way of illustration, Baumgartner finds a little space down the left and blasts goalwards. His effort is blocked. This little period of play has quietened the Riverside considerably. 38 min: England have become a little scrappy in the last few minutes, giving the ball away a couple of times in midfield. Austria don’t punish them, but the mistakes are allowing them to slowly work their way back into the game. 36 min: Baumgartner wins a corner down the right. England clear the set piece easily enough, but Austria come back at the hosts, Kalajdzic having a dig from 25 yards. It’s straight at Pickford and nothing more than a hand-warmer. 34 min: Pickford blooters straight up the middle of the park. Bachmann comes out of his area and bangs it straight back. We’ve gone back to the 1980s. Throw in the European Championship being staged in 2021, but still being called Euro 2020, and the space-time continuum is in a rare old tangle right now. 32 min: Austria aren’t doing a whole lot in attack. England are dominating, though the visitors seem fairly comfortable sitting back and seeing how things pan out. 30 min: Saka and Grealish combine cutely down the inside left, releasing Kane into the box. Kane is one on one with Bachmann, albeit at a tight angle. He shoots straight at the keeper, who smothers, then takes Kane’s boot on the follow-through. The keeper’s up again soon enough, and Kane was probably a sliver offside anyway. 28 min: Alexander-Arnold’s effort is deflected high into the sky. Kane anticipates and meets it dropping to the left of the six-yard box. With his back to goal, he swivels and hooks cleverly across the face of it. Saka nearly pokes home at the near post, but Bachmann tips away. 27 min: Grealish is fouled twice in less than 30 seconds. It’s hardly breaking news, is it. The second of these fouls is made by Dragovic, and here’s a free kick just to the left of the D. 25 min: A lull, so the Riverside belts out the national anthem, then applauds itself for doing so. You have to make your own entertainment sometimes. 23 min: Alexander-Arnold is finding plenty of space out on the right. He seeks out Saka at the far post, but his cross is deflected out for a corner. Trippier takes. Hinteregger heads back towards his own goal, and that’s an easy claim for Bachmann, who has been quite a bit more involved than Pickford so far. 22 min: A pocket of space for Grealish, 30 yards out. He feints to shoot, then tries to release Kane with a sliderule pass down the inside-left channel. Not quite. Austria clear. But lovely idea. 20 min: ... too hard. Schlager comes sliding in on Saka, and it’s so poorly timed it’s a no-brainer of a booking. From the resulting free kick, Lingard flicks in from the right. Hinteregger’s header drops to Saka, who volleys from a tight angle on the left. Goal kick. 19 min: England are beginning to establish territorial dominance. Plenty of possession, though they’re not going anywhere in particular at present. Austria are pressing hard. 17 min: Saka takes, hitting long. The ball breaks to Bellingham, who tries to fizz one goalwards Lingard-style. The ball balloons up into the air. Bachmann goes to claim, only for Kalajdzic to attempt a striker’s clearance. He slices high into the air. Bachmann claims. The Riverside crowd scream backpass, but the English team themselves make no such preposterous claim. We play on. 16 min: Grealish does what Grealish does ... he gets fouled. Lingard tries to set him free down the left. Grealish gets to the ball first, only to be unceremoniously upended by Lainer. Free kick here, just to the side of the box. 14 min: Saka’s back up and good to go. 13 min: Saka is down having taken an accidental whack in the face. No VAR tonight, you’ll be pleased to hear. 11 min: Alexander-Arnold hits the corner long. The ball’s only half cleared. Lingard, meeting the dropping ball on the right-hand edge of the D, drives hard and low. Bellingham flicks precociously, sending the ball into the net. But he’s been penalised for some previous meddling with Bachmann. Shame, because that was a delicious finish. 10 min: Alexander-Arnold nips in from the right, starting a sweeping diagonal move that releases Saka on the other flank. Saka dribbles into the box and earns England’s second corner. 8 min: Hinteregger nicks the ball away from Rice and Grealish, then Beckenbauers his way down the middle of the park, a swaggering run. The ball’s shuttled right to Baumgartner, who sends a rising shot inches over the bar. Pickford had it covered, but that was a very decent speculative effort. Both teams could easily be on the scoresheet already. 6 min: Austria respond with an attack of their own, Alaba causing bother down the left and looking for Baumgartner. Mings hooks clear. A lovely open feel to this game already. More of it, please! 5 min: Kane returns the favour, curling a fine diagonal pass to Alexander-Arnold, who is in acres down the right. The right-back - one of four in the squad, have you heard? - aims for the top right. It’s on target. Bachmann tips over. From the resulting corner, Bellingham heads straight at the keeper. 3 min: Out on the right, Alexander-Arnold swings one of his trademark raking crosses infield. He nearly finds Kane in the centre, but Hinteregger reads the intent and heads clear. 2 min: Nothing much to report yet, other than Austria have started on the front foot, and seem to be prepared to fling a few players forward. Austria get the party started ... but only after everyone takes a knee. Sadly the gesture of solidarity is met with plenty of boos, though happily applause drowns it out pretty quickly. There’s no room for racism. Challenge it. Report it. Change it. Kick it out. Here come the teams. England will play in their traditional white. Austria wear second-choice black shirts and teal kex. Time for the national anthems. The Bundeshymne der Republik Österreich is given a warm reception by the 7,000-strong Riverside crowd. “Land of peaks, land of rivers / Land of fields, land of steeples / Land of labours, future-bound!” To be fair, God Save the Queen goes down pretty well also. We’ll be off in a minute! Gareth Southgate talks to ITV. “The squad are excited to get on with playing some matches. It’s been a break for most of the group since the Premier League season. What we want Trent Alexander-Arnold to do tonight is get forward from right back. We need to be aware of the sort of crosses and passes he can deliver. Jude Bellingham is not just in the 26 for the journey, he has impressed us all season. We’re looking forward to seeing him in the game, he’s trained with real maturity.” Pre-match entertainment. International football on Teesside, then. Any old excuse to wheel out the classics. It’s an experimental team with England missing a big chunk of their Euro squad, the players from Chelsea, Manchester City and Manchester United getting some extra rest. Jude Bellingham makes his full debut at 17. Jack Grealish is back. Jesse Lingard gets a chance to shine, just in case someone drops out late. And there’s a start for Trent Alexander-Arnold, which will surely nip all that idle chatter regarding his relationship with Gareth Southgate in the bud. Eh? Kieran Trippier shifts across to left-back. England: Pickford, Alexander-Arnold, Coady, Mings, Trippier, Grealish, Rice, Bellingham, Lingard, Kane, Saka. Subs: Johnstone, Ramsdale, Calvert-Lewin, Godfrey, Phillips, White, Watkins, Ward-Prowse, J Henderson, Sancho. Austria: Bachmann, Dragovic, Hinteregger, Friedl, Lainer, Baumgartner, Laimer, Xaver Schlager, Alaba, Sabitzer, Kalajdzic. Subs: Pervan, Alexander Schlager, Baumgartlinger, Gregoritsch, Grillitsch, Ilsanker, Lienhart, Posch, Schaub, Schopf, Trimmel, Ulmer. Referee: Lawrence Visser (Belgium). England have only lost to Austria once on home soil. Toni Fritsch scored the deciding goal of a 3-2 win against Alf Ramsey’s ambitious side in 1965, but the game wasn’t transmitted live and his late winner was never shown on the ITV highlights show that evening, a powerful Wembley rendition of God Save The Queen taking its place. This was no nationalistic fit of pique, though. These were the early days of highlights packages, the show was cobbled together at the very last minute, and in the rush, an inexperienced editor selected the wrong strip of film. (The national anthem used to be sung after the game, which makes the error more understandable, if not particularly less egregious.) Never mind, Fritsch got his plaudits back home. He was nicknamed Wembley-Toni for the two goals he scored that night, turning a 2-1 deficit into a famous win, only the fourth by a foreign team on English soil (after the Republic of Ireland, Hungary and Sweden). Six years later, he was signed up by the Dallas Cowboys as a place kicker, going on to get a Super Bowl ring in his very first season in the NFL. But we digress. Austria’s last win over England was in Vienna in 1979. ITV showed this too, and were rewarded with a 4-3 thriller. Kevin Keegan, Steve Coppell and Ray Wilkins scored for Ron’s 11, while Austria’s 70th-minute winner was scored by Bru ... we joke of course. Bruno Pezzey got it, and as the game was transmitted live, his goal was there for the entire network to see, even those watching, presumably celebrating, in the Scottish, Grampian and Ulster regions. The teams last met in Vienna in 2007, Peter Crouch scoring the only goal. Their last visit here was another 1-0 defeat, Frank Lampard scoring a penalty in 2005. Gareth Southgate’s side will be hoping to keep this nice little run going, having won their last six friendlies, though will be wary of the visitors, who have won eight of their last ten friendlies themselves, and were on a great unbeaten sequence of six wins and two draws in Nations League and World Cup qualifiers, before getting trounced 4-0 at home by Denmark in their last outing in March.

Touting the progress already made, and dangling the promise of a “summer of freedom” from Covid-19 to those reluctant to get a shot, the US president urged citizens, especially those under 40, to play a role in the “wartime effort” to defeat the virus. In a 15-minute address from the White House, he laid out a five-point plan to achieve his 4 July target, and tasked Vice-President Kamala Harris and other senior administration figures with a nationwide tour in the coming weeks to spread vaccination information. Incentives for getting a shot, he said, include tax credits for employers and paid time off to get vaccines, free childcare for parents and caregivers to do so, and free beer and complimentary rides to and from vaccination appointments. “It’s going to take everyone, the federal government to state governments, local, tribal and territorial governments, and private sector, and most importantly the American people, to get to the 70% mark,” he said. “America is headed into the summer dramatically different from last year, a summer of freedom, a summer of joy, a summer of get togethers and celebrations, an all-American summer that this country deserves.

Measures, he said, will include a “shots at the shop” initiative, working with hair salons and beauty parlors among others to provide vaccinations during extended opening hours in an effort to encourage racial minorities. “Barbershops, beauty shops, are hubs of activity and information in black and brown communities particularly, but in many communities across the nation,” he said.

Most players would probably like to be keeping out of harm’s way until then, maintaining suppleness but mostly lounging around, possibly chatting, reading, watching movies or rampaging through virtual cities with gamepad in hand. But most of them can’t do that because there are warm-up matches to play and, of course, these are opportunities to force their way into their manager’s plans or, at least, help bluff opposing managers. Here are the game we’ll be paying attention to:</p> <p><strong>Netherlands v Scotland</strong> (kick off 7.45pm)<br></p> <p><strong>Romania v Georgia</strong> (7.45pm)</p> <p><strong>Germany v Denmark</strong> (8pm)</p> <p><strong>France v Wales </strong>(8.05pm)</p> </div>   </div>","wordcount":"2284","firstPublicationDate":"2021-06-02T18:35:18Z","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2021-06-02T21:05:09Z","liveBloggingNow":"false","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/p/hjq3x","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/16982950459c775fd312ff29b3ff1019a130466d/153_4_2802_1681/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","isLive":"true","bodyText":"Netherlands 2-2 Scotland France 3-0 Wales Romania 1-2 Georgia Germany 1-1 Denmark England 1-0 Austria Norway 1-0 Luxembourg Belarus 1-1 Azerbaijan Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina 0-0 Montenegro There was no redemptive goal for Benzema - he even missed a penalty, or rather Danny Ward saved it - but the Real Madrid striker improved France, adding fresh intelligence and sharpness to their attack. The French were full of menace an; but Wales need not be too downhearted because they were doing just fine until Neco Williams unduly harsh red card. Even after that they showed impressive discipline and continued to threaten; in fact, they should have scored at least once, having exposed some deficiencies in the French defence. France are favourites but they’re not flawless. That’s an improvement by Germany - who were beaten at home by North Macedonia - but it wasn’t the sort of performance that’ll have the rest of the continent trembling in their boots. France v Wales: Ward denies Benzema again, this time showing his sharp reflexes to turn away a powerful header from a corner. That goal was all about Benzema. He peeled off his marker to take Kounde’s cross from the right byline on his chest and then unloaded a terrific low shot that struck the base of the post. It rebounded to Dembélé, who fired into the net from seven yards. France v Wales: Lloris is worried, because Brooks is standing over a freekick one yard outside the box, in the D. Digne is lying down behind the wall in case the Welshman tries something sly. But Brooks, perhaps having listened to a testament classic, tries to go over the wall. Benzema jumps to head clear. That was a very encouraging exercise for Steve Clarke’s side, even if they’ll be peeved not to have claimed the victory. They made a a very bold and bright start and opened the scoring with a lovely goal by Hendry. But they let the lead slip too soon, leaving Depay free to net with a fine volley. Nisbet put Scotland back in front with another peach, slotting home calmly after a perfect cross by Robertson. When the Dutch were given a soft freekick two minutes from time, Depay curled into the net. The decision to award the freekick was dubious, but there’s no doubt Depay’s finish was marvellous, curling it into the far corner from just outside the left-hand side of the area. Didn’t see that coming! Eriksen created it with a clever pass between Süle and Hummels. Poulsen fires a low shot from the left-hand side of the box into the far corner. France v Wales: Spirited and slick stuff by Wales! Ramsey nutmegs Kimpembe to slip the ball into the path of James, who burst into the box and blasts at goal. Lloris bats it away but he really shouldn’t have been given the chance to do so: if James had have fired low to the corner, it would surely have been a goal. France v Wales: Koundé clips a cross from the right all the way over to the other flank, where Digne tries to sidefoot a volley into the net. But Wales block. France v Wales: Wales have switched to a back four, with Ben Davies coming on to join Rodon in the hear of it. Netherlands v Scotland: Depay’s freekick at the edge of the area is blocked by McGregor, part of a five-man wall. Still 2-1 to Scotland. France v Wales: It’s total domination by France now. They’ve moving the 10 men around with pitiless ease but, in fairness, a series of last-ditch interventions by Wales has prevented more goals. So far. Digne, on as a substitute, is enjoying lots of space down the left and sending in repeated dangerous crosses. Netherland v Scotland: The Dutch are eager to equalise but Scotland are holding firm. Hendry clears a cross by Depay just in front of his own goal. Still 2-1 to Steve Clarke’s history-makers. Magnifique! Pogba rolled the ball in to Mbappé, who flicked it beautiful through to Griezmann at the edge of the box. The forward then placed a perfect curling shot into the top corner. A sweeping attack down the left by Scotland, then Robertson delicately curls a cross into the path of Nibet, who arrives at the back post to guide it first-time into the net. A composed finish for his first international goal! Things get worse for Romania, already down to 10 men, as Mikautadze gives Georgia the lead. Neuhaus stabs into the net from close range after a bit of scramble in the Danish box. Netherlands v Scotland: The pulsating early tempo has faded and this is now quite a pedestrian game. But Tierney tries to raise the level with a burst down the left and wins a freekick, impeded by Dumfries. Scotland make a mess of the freekick. Still 1-1. Romania v Georgia: Romania are finding it tough going against Georgia: they’ve had most of the ball but have fewer men following Tanase’s dismissal just before half-time. It’s still 0-0. France v Wales: To their credit, Wales end the first half on the attack, Wilson sending a swirler just wide from 25 yards after a corner is half-cleared. They go into the break 1-0 down but knowing they have played pretty well and the game turned on a moment of misfortune for Neco Williams. France v Wales: Rabiot swipes at fresh air after another commanding French buildup. 10-men Wales have a real job on their hands to keep the score down here. France v Wales: Pogba to Griezman to Benzema to Mbappé, whose lifts his shot from 12 yards over the bar. That was a wayward finish after a lovely one-touch move. Germany v Denmark: Germany have been well on top and Gnabry nearly illuminates the first half it with a magical goal! Sadly, after fancy footwork at the edge of the area, his curling shot bounced out off the bar. France v Wales: Les Bleus have a swagger now, with one-goal lead and a one-man advantage. Wales are having to concentrate and work hard to plug all gaps. Rabiot’s shot from 22 yards deflects off Griezmann. Ward, falling the wrong way, manages to adjust to save with his feet, but Mbappé beats Mepham to the rebound and pokes into the net. Netherlands - Scotland: It’s 1-1 at half-time. Hendry gave the Scots the lead with a brilliant strike, but slovenly defending allowed Depay to equalise with a pretty fine strike of his own. France v Wales: France look vexed, like the way to punish Wales. But the Welsh continue to defend peskily and, what’s more, remain eager to counter-attack despite their numerical disadvantage. France v Wales: Benzema is no Ivan Toney but he struck the penalty reasonably well, all the same, if not quite in the corner and with little disguise. Ward read his intentions and produced a super stop. Now all they have to do is hold out with 10 men against the world champions. The Leicester keeper springs to his right and gets a strong hand to Benzema’s low drive! Way to ruin the striker’s much-trumpeted return! That’s absurdly excessive. Giving the penalty was technically legitimate, but sending off Williams for an offence he knew little about is plain silly. France v Wales: Bales gets back to head away a dangerous pass by Griezmann, who trots over to take the corner. Rodon clears it. But France quickly regain possession and Griezmann curls an in-swinging cross from the right. Pogba leaps to get a towering downward header from five yards, and Wards pulls off an amazing save! Neco Williams reacts sharply to block Benzem’s follow-up. But the French players claim he did so with his arm. And they’re right? Williams was only a yard away from the ball but his arms were out in front of him. The ref is going across to look at the monitor ... France v Wales: Dan James is causing France a lot of trouble, sometimes coming short, sometimes dashing in behind. Pavard did well to keep pace with him a moment ago and slide in to poke the ball out for a corner. France v Wales: Allen feeds Wilson, who shuffles for space at the right-hand corner of the box and then tries to curl a shot into far the corner. Good idea, faulty execution. The ball sails towards the empty stands. France v Wales: The French are having plenty of possession and Wales seem fairly content to let them have it, at least in their own half. The visitors are showing commendable discipline and compactness in a high-paced game. Germany v Denmark: After 12 minutes Kasper Schmeichel is forced to make his first save, getting down well to hold a decent effort from Neuhaus. James flies down the left again for Wales and delivers a useful cross. Kimpembe is well placed again, heading it away. Wales threaten! James scampers into the left-hand side of the area after iffy French defending. Lloris faffs at his cross at the near post, just pushing it in front of the goal. Luckily for him, Kimpembe clears it before Allen can pounce. Rodon does well to prevent Mbappé from getting in a cross, but Wales can’t hold on to the ball. When it comes to Pogba on the right, he curls a delicious cross towards Benzema, who glances a header towards the far corner. Wards gets down well to save. After 63 seconds, Wales get their first touch. But France win it straight back, and Hernandez knocks it into the box from the left. Mepham heads it away. Meanwhile in Nice, Tottenham(ish) buddies Hugo Lloris and Gareth Bale swap hugs after the coin toss before France v Wales. Then the ball is delivered to the centre circle on a remote control car because, well, why not. It’s a beautiful finish by Depay, arrowing a low left-footed volley beyond Gordon from 16 yards after Wijnaldum nodded the ball down to him. But why oh why was Depay so free in the Scottish box? Scotland on the rampage again! This time Krul has to fling himself to his right to bat away a shot by Dykes. What a goal! And deserved reward for tremendous Scottish pressing. Armstrong won the ball as the Dutch tried to tip-toe their way through febrile pressure. Then Hendry stepped in and rasped a superb low shot beyond the keeper from 20 yards! Scotland win the ball high up the pitch and quickly work it to Tierney, who goes for goal from 30 yards. It’s a strong, swirling effort ... but it whizzes just wide. Tierney hurries across to make an important clearance, stopping Depay from getting on the end of a dangerous cross from the left. Dumfries fires off the first shot of the game after a long, patient buildup by the Netherlands. He was never likely to beat Gordon from an acute angle on the right and, sure enough, he lashed his shot into the sidenetting. After their perky start, Scotland are being pushed back by the Dutch, without looking threatened. Scotland v Netherland is go! Steve Clarke’s get the game under way in an empty stadium. It’s a feisty opening by the visitors, too, as the Scots pop the ball around nicely while being harassed by the Dutch.

But Ben Davies and Aaron Ramsey all start on the bench. France go with the potentially devastating strikeforce of Mbappé and Benzema, with Griezmann just behind them at the tip of the midfield diamond. Stick in N’golo Kanté and this could be the team they start with against Germany in a couple of weeks. France: Lloris; Pavard, Varane, Kimpembe, L.Hernandez; Tolisso, Pogba, Rabiot, Griezmann; Benzema, Mbappé.

Most players would probably like to be keeping out of harm’s way until then, maintaining suppleness but mostly lounging around, possibly chatting, reading, watching movies or rampaging through virtual cities with gamepad in hand. But most of them can’t do that because there are warm-up matches to play and, of course, these are opportunities to force their way into their manager’s plans or, at least, help bluff opposing managers.

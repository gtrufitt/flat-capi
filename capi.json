officials in New South Wales, Australia, have had to reiterate advice over Covid-19 after a number of businesses in Byron Shire were witnessed asking vaccinated customers not to enter their premises under the misapprehension they could shed the virus. The New South Wales department of health has stressed that it is impossible for people to develop, shed, or spread the virus through receiving a vaccine. The advice comes after some businesses in the small town of Mullumbimby placed signs in their windows that read: ‘If you have had the Covid-19 vaccine we ask you not to enter for two weeks or longer until any symptoms subside’. One of the signs falsely states that the spread of the virus following vaccination was emerging from “first hand accounts” and that vaccinated people were “inadvertently harming” the health of others. The town is located in the Northern Rivers region of New South Wales and is about 15km inland from Byron Bay. It is a region with a high level of vaccine hesitancy and refusal, with childhood vaccination rates among the lowest in Australia. A former paramedic who runs a World Health Organisation [WHO] approved vaccination information website, Heidi Robertson, said she was appalled to see the signs as she walked down Stuart Street on Monday. She and health professionals living in the region, including intensive care specialist Dr Rachael Heap, have been working hard for several years to educate the community about vaccination. “We wanted to change the narrative around the region, because we’ve got such a shocking rate of vaccination uptake and we are known for that in Mullumbimby,” Robertson said. Read more of Melissa Davey’s report here: ‘Vaccine won’t give you Covid’: health officials battle anti-vaccination messages in Northern Rivers Andrew Sparrow’s UK live blog is up and running for the day if it is UK developments that you are after. I’ll keep my focus on international Covid news here. A total of 95 deaths registered in England and Wales in the week ending 28 May mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) - the lowest number since the week ending 4 September 2020. PA note that the figure is down 11% on the previous week. It is the first time the number of deaths has been below 100 since the week ending 11 September. Around one in 100 deaths registered in the week to 28 May mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate. China has approved the emergency use of a Covid-19 vaccine for those as young as three, according to a spokesperson for Sinovac who spoke to AFP. That would make it the first country to offer jabs to young children. “In recent days, the Sinovac vaccine was approved for emergency use in three- to 17-year-olds,” the spokesperson said. But they did not confirm when the young children would be able to start receiving the shots, saying the schedule for the rollout will be decided by the National Health Commission “according to China’s current epidemic prevention and control needs and vaccine supply”. The company has completed early phase trials of the vaccine in children and adolescents, with results to be published shortly in the Lancet scientific journal, the spokesperson added. State broadcaster CCTV reported over the weekend that an unnamed official in the State Council’s epidemic response task force had said vaccines had been approved for children, and “the safety and effectiveness” had been proven. A spokesperson for China’s other major vaccine, Sinopharm, said that experts had demonstrated the effectiveness of its vaccine in children, but didn’t confirm whether it had been approved for use. A quick one from Reuters: Russia reported 9,977 new Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, including 3,817 in Moscow. The government coronavirus task force also said that 379 people had died of coronavirus-related causes in the last 24 hours, pushing the official death toll to 124,496. That’s far fewer than the 270,000 that the state statistics service says had died from Covid-19 and related causes from April 2020 to April 2021. Britain ignored scientific advice and instead took a political decision when it failed to put Malta on its list of safe travel destinations, Malta Foreign Minister Evarist Bartolo said. Britons traditionally account for a third of all arrivals on the small Mediterranean island, and opposition politicians criticised the government for failing to convince London that Malta was a safe tourist destination. Britain last week revised its so-called “green list” of countries, that do not require quarantine on return, choosing not to put any new country on it, while removing Portugal. But Bartolo said the British government did not want its nationals to go abroad because of concerns over growing coronavirus cases at home. “The British government is ignoring scientific advice. It has taken a political decision not to allow travel anywhere, despite the pressure it faces from airlines, tourism operators and the people in general,” he wrote on Facebook. Chris Scicluna reports from Valetta for Reuters that Malta on Monday reported no new Covid-19 cases for the first time in 11 months. Half of its adult population has been fully vaccinated and 75% have received a first dose of a vaccine - the highest rate within the European Union. Dr Nikki Kanani, director of primary care at NHS England, said that vaccine confidence in younger people had increased in the UK. Speaking as over-25s were invited to book their Covid-19 jabs, PA report Dr Kanani told BBC Breakfast: “We’re still seeing great uptake and we are definitely seeing younger people coming in and asking more questions, which is absolutely fine. “More than four in five 40 to 49-year-olds have had their first dose and two-thirds of 30 to 39-year-olds have already had theirs, and that is still going to increase, of course, as people come forward, so uptake remains high. “We had additional polling over the weekend that shows that the confidence in the vaccine has increased by a fifth - by 20% - in those under-40s. “What’s really important as we go into the younger categories is really appealing to people in their own communities and what our teams have done so well is reflect what a community needs locally - whether that’s setting up pop-up vaccination centres in Gurudwaras or temples, or in shopping malls or at workplaces, that has been critical to making sure that people feel confident to take up the vaccine when they’re asked to do so.” Overnight saw a rush to travel back to the UK from Portugal, as travellers had until 4am to return to avoid having to quarantine for 10 days after the country was moved from the “green” list to the “amber” list, without being placed on a watchlist first. The UK’s environment minister has been getting a tough ride on the media morning round in the UK – being asked whether the travel rules, and government advice, have to be this complicated, and why there was so little warning of the change of status. Eustace said “Our advice has always been that you should not travel to countries on the amber list.” The Gaby Hinsliff column today asks the question before Britain vaccinates children, should it vaccinate the world? She writes: Personally I was thrilled to get my vaccine and would be more than happy for my son to have it, but what brought me up short was the question I saw posed recently by the epidemiologist Adam Kucharski: if rich countries have enough vaccine left to jab children at incredibly low risk of serious illness and death, why aren’t they offering it to poorer countries where people are dying for lack of it? Shouldn’t we be taking more seriously the threat not just of humanitarian crises, but of a more resistant variant emerging in some place where the virus is currently raging out of control, fatally undermining the vaccines that remain our only real route to freedom? Only 2% of sub-Saharan Africa has had a first dose. Thailand, engulfed by a severe outbreak, is only just beginning mass vaccinations. Even if the G7 summit agrees this week to invest billions in ramping up vaccine production for poorer countries – as a group of former world leaders led by Gordon Brown wants – that takes months to come on stream. If Britain doesn’t want to seal its borders – and nothing in ministers’ confused approach to foreign holidays suggests they do – then digging an ever-stronger domestic firebreak against the more contagious Delta variant we have just imported from India won’t be enough. We’re going to need a global firebreak against something worse evolving too, and fast. Read more here: Gaby Hinsliff – Before Britain vaccinates children, should it vaccinate the world? Helen Davidson reports from Taipei: Some tentative good news from Taiwan, with a second consecutive day of cases in the 200s and no new cases from backlogged test results. As long as results are not down because of lower weekend testing, the decline is a positive sign in Taiwan’s battle against its worst outbreak of the pandemic. However with about 8,000 cases still active, fatalities have not stopped and authorities reported another 22 deaths. The new cases were mostly in New Taipei city, with 123 recorded. Another 54 were reported from the capital Taipei, while 16 were found in Miaoli where there are growing concerns over an outbreak among employees from three factories which has so far infected 211 people. Health and welfare minister, Chen Chih-shung, said the rate of positive cases in New Taipei was dropping but there was no room yet to relax current restrictions. He urged people not to travel during an upcoming long weekend and dragon-boat festival, which authorities have not cancelled. Vaccine supplies took another hit, with authorities saying expected shipments of AstraZeneca and from Covax had been delayed by about a month. Half of the 150,000 recently obtained Moderna vaccines have been allocated to frontline medical staff. China’s vaccination numbers are never low. Official figures reported by Reuters say that the nation administered about 16.3 million doses of vaccine on 7 June, bringing the total number administered to 794m. In India, the state of Uttar Pradesh has announced that it will end some Covid restrictions. The Hindustan Times reports this morning: The Uttar Pradesh government on Tuesday gave relaxations in ‘corona curfew’ in all 75 districts of the state. According to guidelines announced by the state government, districts with less than 600 active cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) can get relaxations. A state government spokesperson said that there will be relaxation in coronavirus curfew in all the districts of the state from Wednesday onwards, from 7am to 7pm, for five days. However, the night curfew – 7pm to 7am and weekend curfew (for entire day) – will continue. The UK’s environment secretary George Eustace – a man who clearly isn’t in the position where he hasn’t seen family and loved ones abroad for over a year due to travel bans – has told Sky News this morning: “I have no intention of travelling or going on a holiday abroad this summer.” He was being pressed by newly returned presenter Kay Burley on the scramble for flights back from Portugal after it was moved from the “green list” to the “amber list” with very little warning. PA Media quotes him saying: Our advice has been don’t travel unless it’s absolutely necessary. Obviously we had hoped, with these three categories that we had, we had hoped that situation would be improving in other parts of the world, that we’d be able to progressively add other countries to the green list. Sadly, that’s not the situation, we do have this new variant of concern first identified in India that is now cropping up in other countries, and we’ve just got to take a very cautious approach. Asked about the UK government’s delay in shutting down travel from India, he said “India was added as soon as we saw a spike in rates and as soon as we saw there was a reason to”, denying that the delay had been political. At the time Indian case numbers were rising and the government took no action, UK prime minister Boris Johnson had been planning to visit India in his first major trip abroad since the pandemic, with the aim of pushing a post-Brexit UK-India trade deal. Unicef has urged rich members of the G7 to start donating vaccines to poor countries now, instead of waiting to donate leftovers all at once, saying many nations don’t have capacity to roll out huge amounts in one go. Unicef’s vaccine lead Lily Caprani told BBC Newsnight governments in the UK and other G7 nations “need to donate their doses to those low income countries now, while still vaccinating their populations at home.” “Low income countries need a steady supply that they can get off the tarmac and into the arms of health care workers... The unintended consequence of saving all these vaccines up to Christmas time is that countries won’t be able to absorb them and roll them out and therefore they could end up going to waste. We could see millions of doses of vaccines not used and expiring, and that will be a tragedy.” The World Health Organization has also called on Covid-19 vaccine manufacturers to give the Covax scheme first refusal on new doses, or commit half of their volumes to the global jab equity scheme. Our health editor Sarah Boseley asks the question this morning: Can we vaccinate the world against Covid by the end of 2022? As ambitious declarations go – even for Boris Johnson – it was a big one. At the weekend, the UK prime minister said he would urge the G7 leaders to vaccinate the world against Covid by the end of next year. But is this feasible? That rather depends on your definition. No country will vaccinate every adult. Vaccinating enough to achieve herd immunity, which could be 60% or 70%, is the real aim. It is possible to achieve that by December 2023, say experts, but only if the G7 leading economies move immediately to make it happen. The Covax scheme under the UN umbrella should have been the route to vaccination for low-income countries. It was designed as their lifeline. Covax signed contracts with manufacturers to buy 2bn doses by the end of this year. But it is stymied. Its main supplier is the Serum Institute of India, which is now churning out vaccines in response to the terrible surge in domestic cases and deaths and will not be able to fulfil its contracts to Covax or individual countries before the end of the year. Dr Bruce Aylward, senior adviser to the director general of the World Health Organization, who is heavily involved in the vaccine efforts, said: “This is where the UK becomes really important and the G7, because right now we’ve got this gap of death. In June, July, August, September, there’s no vaccine out there for love nor money, in terms of being able to procure it.” Read more of Sarah Boseley’s analysis here: Can we vaccinate the world against Covid by the end of 2022? The president of the Tokyo 2020 organising committee, Seiko Hashimoto, is speaking this morning, and she is setting out some of the procedures that will be undertaken to try to keep the games safe. So far, she’s said that media will not be able to use shared accommodation, and that the media will be GPS-tracked to ensure they don’t go into unauthorised areas. She has also said that they expect to start vaccinating Olympics-related staff by mid-June. Reuters note that foreign spectators have already been banned, and organisers are expected to make a decision late this month on domestic spectators. Toshiaki Endo, the vice-president of the Tokyo organising committee, has previously suggested to Reuters some spectators could be allowed into venues, although he personally preferred a total ban to calm persistent public opposition to the Games.

China today pledged further assistance to Southeast Asian nations in battling the pandemic, the Associated Press reports. The country’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, told his Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) counterparts that China had already delivered 100 million doses of vaccine to Asean nations along with other materials and technical help. Wang said China would “urgently implement” the China-Asean Public Health Cooperation Initiative, continue to support the Asean Emergency Medical Materials Reserve and strengthen regional public health capacity-building. “China will work with Asean to overcome the outbreak as soon as possible,” Wang told a meeting of ministers.

Beijing has been building influence with Asean, despite frictions with some members of the bloc over competing territorial claims in the South China Sea. Welcome to another day of the pandemic, and our continuing global coverage of the latest developments. Below are some of the key updates from the last day. Canada is preparing to ease birder restrictions for vaccinated travellers, Bloomberg reports. A top Japanese virologist and government adviser has warned of the risks of spreading infections during the Tokyo Olympics. Australia’s state of Victoria is on track to ease restrictions on residents, currently in a lockdown to deal with an outbreak of the Delta variant, authorities said. India’s government will provide free vaccinations for all adults, Prime Minister Narendra Modi says, as the capital New Delhi and financial hub Mumbai ease lockdowns on falling infection levels. A new coronavirus antibody drug appears to show promise in mouse studies, according to a study published in Nature. The Czech Republic has announced it will reopen its borders to EU and Serbian citizens on June 21. Just days before the start of the Euros, Spain’s football players and staff have returned negative Covid-19 tests after captain Sergio Busquets had to go home and quarantine. There was “delight across Ireland” as the country reopened pubs, restaurants and leisure facilities. Central Park is to host an “all-star” concert in August to mark New York’s comeback after the pandemic. New York governor Andrew Cuomo has announced that the state’s remaining coronavirus restrictions will be lifted when 70% of residents have had at least one vaccine dose.","charCount":"19738","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a> (now) and <a href=\"profile/helen-davidson\">Helen Davidson</a> (earlier)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/live/2021/jun/08/brexit-eustice-sausages-eu-northern-ireland-protocol-g7-covid-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-08T09:06:44Z","webTitle":"Brexit: Eustice attacks ‘nonsensical’ ban on selling sausages as row with EU over Northern Ireland protocol deepens – live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2021/jun/08/brexit-eustice-sausages-eu-northern-ireland-protocol-g7-covid-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/live/2021/jun/08/brexit-eustice-sausages-eu-northern-ireland-protocol-g7-covid-live","fields":{"headline":"Brexit: Eustice attacks ‘nonsensical’ ban on selling sausages as row with EU over Northern Ireland protocol deepens – live","standfirst":"<p>Latest updates: minister suggests US might side with UK over the Northern Ireland protocol if issue is brought up at this week’s G7 summit</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/jun/08/stop-brexit-blame-game-northern-ireland-business-leaders-tell-uk-and-eu\">Stop Brexit ‘blame game’, Northern Ireland business leaders tell UK and EU</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus global updates – live</a></li></ul>","trailText":"Minister suggests US might side with UK over the Northern Ireland protocol if issue is brought up at this week’s G7 summit","byline":"Andrew Sparrow","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b57a47aaf89ec867f190025a334e1c318cb7e686\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b57a47aaf89ec867f190025a334e1c318cb7e686/0_400_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Waiting lorries in the container terminal in Belfast Port in May.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Waiting lorries in the container terminal in Belfast Port in May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Artur Widak/NurPhoto/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<div id=\"block-60bf2f838f0827600c04c3ce\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-08T09:06:13.197Z\">10.06am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">EU says it will retaliate 'firmly and resolutely' if UK does not stick to its Northern Ireland protocol obligations</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The dispute between the UK and the EU over the implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol will be thrashed out tomorrow at a meeting in London between Lord Frost, the Brexit minister, and <strong>Maroš Šefčovič</strong>, the European commission vice president.</p> <p>It’s the first meeting of the joint partnership council, set up to oversee the implementation of the EU-UK trade deal, combined with a meeting of the joint committee, set up to oversee the operation of the Northern Ireland protocol.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/06/08/uk-eu-must-sing-hymn-sheet-comes-northern-ireland/\">an article for the Daily Telegraph</a>, Šefčovič suggests that the EU is finding it hard to trust the UK because of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/mar/03/supermarkets-may-get-more-time-to-adapt-to-northern-ireland-trading-rules-brexit\">the government’s decision earlier this year to unilaterally delay implementing aspects of the deal. </a>He says there have been “numerous and fundamental gaps in the UK’s implementation”, and he starts his article:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The prolific English hymn composer Isaac Watts once said: “Learning to trust is one of life’s most difficult tasks.”</p> <p>And yet it is also one of the most important tasks when it comes to building a productive, enduring and mutually beneficial partnership.</p> <p>As I travel to London today, it is clear that this week will be a defining one for consolidating trust between the European Union and the United Kingdom.</p> </blockquote> <p>And in a comment that led to the Telegraph writing up the story under the headline “Europe threatens sausage trade war”, Šefčovič says the EU will act “firmly” if the UK does not agree deadlines for complying with its obligations.

If you don’t remember the Euro sausage episode, there are reminders here and here. My colleague Daniel Boffey’s slightly more measured take on the story is here. George Eustice, the environment secretary, did an interview round this morning and he claimed the Northern Ireland protocol would make it impossible for traders to sell sausages from Great Britain in Northern Ireland. He told Sky News: What you have to bear in mind is that the protocol always envisaged that both parties would show best endeavours to make the Northern Ireland protocol work, and that included recognising that Northern Ireland was an integral part of the UK and that you should support the free flow of goods to Northern Ireland. What we really need the EU to do is to respect that part of the protocol and put in place sensible measures to remove things like the nonsensical ban on selling sausages or chicken nuggets to Northern Ireland – not just requiring paperwork, but actually having an outright ban on some of those goods – that clearly doesn’t make sense.

They’ll all be examined for signs that the recovery is on track, and hints of when central bankers might start to tighten their stimulus packages. Ray Attrill, head of FX Strategy at National Australia Bank, says: The start of a new week has not seen much by way of price action across all asset classes. “It’s hard to avoid the sense the global markets are for the most part now simply lurching from one big event risk to the next with not a lot to see in-between. It’s another quiet day in Europe’s stock markets, as investors take a breather after some lively sessions this year. The pan-European Stoxx 600 snuck up to a new record high this morning, up 0.2% to 454.52, suggesting confidence in the recovery remains strong. However, Germany’s DAX is slightly lower, following this morning’s surprise drop in industrial output. Manufacturers such as HeidelbergCement (-2.6%), materials group Covestra (-1.3%), and carmakers Volkswagen (-1.5%) and Daimler (-1.2%) as leading the fallers. On April’s factory slowdown, Teeuwe Mevissen, senior market economist at Rabobank, says: “I think it says more about the supply constraints. The big question is how long will these remain,” “Markets are in a wait-and-see mode. Valuations are high, and they need new catalysts to justify further buying.” Back on Germany....Capital Economics’ Andrew Kenningham says its factory slowdown means the economy was under par in April. But he’s still hopeful that Germany return to growth in the current quarter, having shrunk in January-March. He writes: The decline in German industrial production in April underlines that the German economy was performing well below normal at the start of the second quarter. But things should have improved since then, so we still expect GDP to rebound after its sharp decline in Q1. British American Tobacco (+1.6%) are also in the risers, after raising revenue forecasts on the back of higher demand for ‘non-tobacco’ products (such as vaping kits and nicotine pouches). BAT now expects revenue growth guidance of above 5% for 2021, as it pushes these ‘new category’ products such as Vuse, Velo and Glo. Jack Bowles, chief executive, said: “We added +1.4 million non-combustible product consumers in Q1, to reach a total of 14.9 million. “We are growing New Categories at pace, encouraging more smokers to switch to scientifically substantiated reduced-risk alternatives.” Back in February, my colleagues Rob Davies and Matthew Chapman reported how BAT had launched a £1bn campaign using social media and popular influencers to promote its e-cigarettes, vapes and pouches. They explained: Critics say that such viral videos, even if they aren’t paid-for adverts, are the consequence of a global marketing push designed to offset dwindling cigarette consumption by recruiting the nicotine consumers of the future. BAT has embarked on a £1bn campaign that harnesses the popular appeal of social media influencers, pop stars and sporting events. According to a wide-ranging report by The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, it has also attracted younger adults, non-smokers and even reached the eyes of children. Shares in UK insurance firm Aviva have jumped 3.6%, after activist investor Cevian took a 5% stake - and started pressing for change. Cevian, Europe’s biggest activist investor, is pushing for Aviva to make deeper cost cuts, and return £5bn to investors following recent asset sales. Christer Gardell, Cevian’s co-founder, says: “Aviva has been poorly managed for many years, and its high-quality core businesses have been held back by high costs and a series of bad strategic decisions.” Shares in Aviva have gained 14.7p to 425p this morning, their highest since January 2020, just before the pandemic. Aviva has been selling off international assets since CEO Amanda Blanc took the helm last summer, and pledged to focus on larger businesses in the UK, Ireland and Canada. But Cevian argues that Aviva’s share price could climb to more than £8 within three years, if it returned excess capital to shareholders through dividends or buybacks. The FT has more details... Aviva has promised substantial returns and cost reductions as central planks of its strategy shift under Blanc, who has told investors that her mantra is to move quickly. However, Cevian wants a specific return of £5bn in dividends or buybacks of capital that the insurer has in excess of regulatory requirements The activist fund also believes that the cost-cutting can go further, calling for reductions of more than £500m from Aviva’s annual cost base by 2023, compared with the management’s target of £300m. It is also pushing for a leaner management structure, according to a person familiar with the matter. In London, stocks have opened a little higher, with the FTSE 100 up 15 points or 0.2% to 7092 points. Asset manager Intermediate Capital Group are the top riser, surging 6.7%, after reporting record profits, and a 19% jump in third-party assets under management amid the recovery in markets over the last year. But oil producer Royal Dutch Shell are down 1.3%, following a drop in the oil price this morning, while steelmaker Evraz is down 1.5%. Brent crude has dipped 0.5% to $71 per barrel, after China’s crude oil imports dropped by almost 15% in May - suggesting weaker demand. Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizhuo Securities, said: “Chinese oil imports at a five-month low ... would tend to confirm weakness in the Asia market.” On a brighter note, Japan’s economy shrank by less than first feared in the January-March quarter. Q1 GDP was revised up today, to show an annualised contraction of 3.9% (so almost 1% smaller on a quarterly basis). That’s up from a preliminary reading of a 5.1% contraction (or -1.3% q/q). Government spending and corporate investment fell less than first estimated, although household spending fell slightly more. Although the upgrade is welcome, it still leaves Japan half-way into recession, and breaks its recovery in the second half of 2020. A lack of semiconductors, timber and other intermediate goods weighed on German industrial output, says Reuters: The weaker than expected industrial figures suggest that the German economy will have to rely on household spending to support a still-fragile recovery from the coronavirus crisis. “Such a combination is unparalleled: Order books in industry are well filled and production is falling,” VP Bank economist Thomas Gitzel said, adding that the supply problems with semiconductors were pushing down output in the car industry. So despite well-filled order books, manufacturing will only make a limited contribution to overall economic growth in the second quarter, Gitzel said. The week-long blockage of the Suez Canal by the Ever Given in March contributed to the supply chain problems hitting German firms in April, suggests Carsten Brzeski of ING. He writes that April’s disappointing drop in industrial production suggests the rebound of the German economy in Q2 has ‘started with shaky knees’: The disappointing start to the second quarter suggests that supply chain disruptions, like the blockage of the Suez Canal in April or the ongoing semiconductor delivery problems, have not left German industry unscathed. However despite today’s disappointment, the industrial outlook remains bright. Brzeski adds that capacity issues and the lack of qualified workers could soon return as the most pressing hurdles to growth, as lack of demand isn’t a problem. Destatis also reports that German construction output fell by 4.3% in April -- suggesting that shortages of building materials might be weighing on the sector. Energy production jumped by 6.0%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Output at German factories has fallen unexpectedly, as supply chain bottlenecks and shortages of key parts and materials such as computer chips threaten to undermine the recovery. German industrial production fell by 1.0% in April, the Federal Statistics Office reports this morning. That’s shy of forecasts of a 0.5% rise, as Europe’s largest economy looked to recover from its contraction earlier this year. Production of consumer goods slumped by 3.3% - even though some households are expected to be spending heavily this summer as lockdowns restriction are lifted. Production of intermediate goods (items used in final products) fell 0.2%, while production of heavy duty capital goods decreased by 0.1%. March’s growth was revised down too, from +2.5% to +2.2%. It means production at German factories is still 5.6% below its pre-pandemic levels, despite the pick-up in the global economy this year. Factory bosses have been warning of shortages of semiconductors, plastics, rubber and metals, with suppliers hiking prices in response. These shortfalls are threatening to undermine the recovery from last year’s economic slump, and are also pushing prices higher as firms try to recoup their costs. Yesterday we learned that German factory orders fell in April, indicating that the problems may last for some time. Semiconductor shortages are a particular problem, which has already hit car production this year. Those shortages are expected to run into next year, as ramping up chip fabrication plants takes time. Tesla is reportedly considering buying its own chip plant, to guarantee supplies. Bosch, Europe’s largest auto supplier, says car manufacturers must put “money on the table” and make a “rock solid” commitment to orders, Bosch board member Harald Krüger told the Financial Times. “The only way to get out of [the recent crisis] is to have a different level of commitment” Bosch opened a €1bn semiconductor plant in Dresden yesterday, to produce chips for its power tools in July, before beginning production on automotive chips in September. That might help to ease the chip shortage, though as Krüger says.... “Money needs to be put on the table and actually parts have to be bought. “The commitment needs to be rock solid that those parts will be bought. It can’t be: ‘Maybe I [will] buy them, prepare for it, and maybe not.’ This doesn’t work.” More here: Carmakers must ‘put money on table’ to avoid repeat of chip crisis The agenda 8.30am BST: Bank of England to publish details of its 2021 climate change stress test 10am BST: ZEW index of German economic sentiment 10am BST: Eurozone Q1 GDP and employment figures (final estimate) 11am BST: US NFIB business optimism index 1.30pm BST: US trade balance for April 3pm BST: US JOLTS index of job openings","charCount":"10910","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/graemewearden\">Graeme Wearden</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2021/jun/08/susie-wheldon-dan-wheldon-indycar-sons-racing","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-08T09:00:17Z","webTitle":"Susie Wheldon: ‘Dan would have been over the moon about our sons racing’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/jun/08/susie-wheldon-dan-wheldon-indycar-sons-racing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2021/jun/08/susie-wheldon-dan-wheldon-indycar-sons-racing","fields":{"headline":"Susie Wheldon: ‘Dan would have been over the moon about our sons racing’","standfirst":"<p>Nearly 10 years after her husband was killed during a race, Susie Wheldon’s sons are following in their father’s footsteps.

It’s a shame that, for all of its unnerving tonal registers, not to mention a gorgeous score, Agony winds up with a painfully predictable ending. • Agony is released on 14 June on digital platforms.","charCount":"1880","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"true","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/phuong-le\">Phuong Le</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"food/2021/jun/08/10-kitchen-gadgets-you-really-dont-need-from-garlic-presses-to-spiralizers","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-08T09:00:16Z","webTitle":"10 kitchen gadgets you really don’t need – from garlic presses to spiralizers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/jun/08/10-kitchen-gadgets-you-really-dont-need-from-garlic-presses-to-spiralizers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/food/2021/jun/08/10-kitchen-gadgets-you-really-dont-need-from-garlic-presses-to-spiralizers","fields":{"headline":"10 kitchen gadgets you really don’t need – from garlic presses to spiralizers","standfirst":"<p>The average household has more than £300 worth of unused cookery kit.

A no-custard, no-churn recipe, where you whisk a 397g tin of condensed milk into 300ml double cream until it is thick enough that your finger leaves an indentation in the mix when poked.

Seal still has a “rubbish” hand-grinder that makes “the worst cup of coffee”. But all is not lost: “I’ve used it for grinding spices and it’s very good at cardamom.”</p> <h2>Bread-maker (£70-£250)</h2> <p>If you are particularly stretched for time or find baking physically difficult, but still want loaves made to your personal specification, bread-makers are clearly useful.

Pasta-rolling machines only make fresh egg pasta sheets suitable for lasagne, filled pastas such as ravioli or for cutting into flat noodles, eg fettuccine. Ultimately, human beats machine.</p> <p>Having created your rich egg pasta (for four people, 400g of Italian 00 flour combined with two whole eggs and four or five yolks, kneaded for five minutes and rested for 30 until it is “stiff but not hard”), you will get better pasta using a rolling pin to create 1mm thin sheets.

And, if you drop it into fiercely boiling water, it will break up.” After three minutes, lift the egg on a slotted spoon; when done, its white should sit up firmly on the spoon.

But at least it was time to come up with a plan.</p> <p>As the temperatures started to climb last month, Hoy stocked up on groceries and filled her car with fuel. She bought two tennis rackets and three bottles of vodka. She had her backyard inspected for breaches. She even picked up pee pads for her Bernese mountain dog, in case she could not leave her house at all.</p> <p>Then all Hoy could do was wait. “I look out my blinds every two seconds,” she says. “Just waiting for them.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fc08869eb4e18e3d56e6ce6a99f7a2f0bc20beab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc08869eb4e18e3d56e6ce6a99f7a2f0bc20beab/0_454_4837_2904/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A cicada sits on a sidewalk in Dublin, Ohio.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A cicada sits on a sidewalk in Dublin, Ohio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tannen Maury/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Every 17 years, cicadas swarm several eastern US states, coating tree trunks and walls, bouncing off cars and people, drowning out engines with their deafening call. “Brood X”, the largest and most widespread of the known periodical cicada groups, began emerging late last month.</p> <p>For most people, the short-lived infestation falls somewhere between irritation and oddity. For some, it is like landing in a horror movie.</p> <p>“I was totally taken by surprise,” says Michelle Dillingham of the 2004 “emergence” – the ominous term given to the cicadas’ arrival above ground. “It was so debilitating: sitting in my car, looking out the window, seeing these very large cicadas flying around and feeling frozen, like I could not move.”</p> <p>Dillingham, a social worker, says the experience helped her to relate to her clients with anxiety disorders.

The fear of insects, or entomophobia, is well recognized among them, and can be hugely disruptive.

The first were emerging just as they left Ohio. “I was just thanking my lucky stars that I was going to get out of there,” says Dillingham from roadside Wyoming.</p> <p>Hoy, the social worker, first encountered cicadas in 2008 with Brood XIV, on a different schedule from Brood X. While driving, she came face-to-face with a cicada perched atop the gearstick, “looking up at me with those red, beady eyes”.</p> <p>Hoy is audibly repulsed by the memory. “It’s like they stare into your soul, like, ‘Hey, bitch.

But at least it was time to come up with a plan. As the temperatures started to climb last month, Hoy stocked up on groceries and filled her car with fuel. She bought two tennis rackets and three bottles of vodka. She had her backyard inspected for breaches. She even picked up pee pads for her Bernese mountain dog, in case she could not leave her house at all. Then all Hoy could do was wait. “I look out my blinds every two seconds,” she says. “Just waiting for them.” Every 17 years, cicadas swarm several eastern US states, coating tree trunks and walls, bouncing off cars and people, drowning out engines with their deafening call. “Brood X”, the largest and most widespread of the known periodical cicada groups, began emerging late last month. For most people, the short-lived infestation falls somewhere between irritation and oddity. For some, it is like landing in a horror movie. “I was totally taken by surprise,” says Michelle Dillingham of the 2004 “emergence” – the ominous term given to the cicadas’ arrival above ground. “It was so debilitating: sitting in my car, looking out the window, seeing these very large cicadas flying around and feeling frozen, like I could not move.” Dillingham, a social worker, says the experience helped her to relate to her clients with anxiety disorders. To get from car to door, “I’d just put a raincoat around my head and run.” An estimated 12.5% of US adults report a specific phobia at some point in their lives, or about 9% in a given year. The fear of insects, or entomophobia, is well recognized among them, and can be hugely disruptive. But even for those whose experience is less severe, the sudden appearance of billions of outlandish insects can seem a cruel joke. Some will do whatever it takes to avoid it. Back in 2004, Dillingham told herself: “I don’t care what is going on for my life in 17 years – but I am going to get out of Cincinnati.” She and her son are now on a road trip nearly two decades in the planning, working remotely, entirely to escape the cicadas. The first were emerging just as they left Ohio. “I was just thanking my lucky stars that I was going to get out of there,” says Dillingham from roadside Wyoming. Hoy, the social worker, first encountered cicadas in 2008 with Brood XIV, on a different schedule from Brood X. While driving, she came face-to-face with a cicada perched atop the gearstick, “looking up at me with those red, beady eyes”. Hoy is audibly repulsed by the memory. “It’s like they stare into your soul, like, ‘Hey, bitch. I’m here. Be afraid’… You can never trust anything with eyes like that.” Cicadas cannot bite or sting; they don’t even have jaws. But for those with a phobia, that is irrelevant. “Sure, it’s irrational … a bug that comes out every 17 years, how does it affect your life?” says Hoy. “But it really does. It’s traumatic.” Even their lifecycle unsettles her: “They just chill underground, for almost 20 years. I went to college in that time! That is not normal behavior.” And then there is the sheer number of them: billions, even trillions. “It’s some Jurassic Park-world shit out there,” says Hoy. In two weeks, she estimates that she has left her house three times. “It’s six weeks of hell – but then they’re gone for 17 years.” In 1987, Jane Pyron was visiting her then boyfriend’s parents’ home in Cincinnati. Brood X was out in force, visible in the trees even from inside. “I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. I was horrified,” says Pyron. “I could see them putting their eggs on the branches, their big buggy red eyes.” When she and her boyfriend, Lindsey, broke up, “no more cicada vacations” was a silver lining. But 30 years later, they reconnected. When Lindsey proposed in 2018, she agreed with a “huge stipulation”: “I said, ‘I’ll marry you and move to Ohio – but when the cicadas come out, I have to leave.’ “But then, of course,” she adds, “I got a job.” Unable to flee the state, Pyron has met her fear with creative problem-solving. She covers herself from head to toe with a creation of her own making, built from an umbrella and two shower curtains. Hoy, for her part, wears a beekeeping suit when she must go outdoors and compulsively monitors the Cicada Safari tracking app intended for scientific research. There is such demand for solutions through cicada season that a company making weather-proof, wearable “walking pods” recently released a limited-edition mesh version for nearly $100. Some people feel such anxiety about cicadas, they are unable to work, says Dillingham – but support, or even sympathy, can be hard to come by. In late April, Dillingham set up the “Cincinatti Cicada-Phobia Safe Space” on Facebook, billed as a forum “to share ways to cope!!”. In six weeks the group has gained nearly 1,000 members and four moderators, upholding only two rules: no making fun of the phobia, and no posting pictures of cicadas. “That’s why it’s called a safe space,” says Crystal Smith, a moderator; for some people, just “that wretched sound” is trigger enough. With Brood X’s 2021 emergence now well under way, activity in the group has been frenetic, including expert insights, strategies for self-protection and sightings around Cincinnati. Though Dillingham feels “a little guilty” that not everyone can have an escape plan like hers, she believes the online resources has helped first-timers in particular to prepare. “They have it much better than we did in 2004,” she says. Some have even felt empowered to try to conquer their fears.

An estimated 300 Australian cast and crew members are believed to have been affected by the sudden decision to wrap up the project early, with only eight of the planned 16 episodes now having any chance of seeing the light of day. A statement sent to Guardian Australia from Netflix said the decision had been a “mutual creative decision” made with McCarthy and Falcone. “At Netflix our series can be any length and we and the producers felt an eight-episode limited series best served the story,” the statement said. “The show has wrapped and pick-ups are slated to be completed in both Australia and Los Angeles.” The Guardian understands that while the production’s cast were paid out for the full 16-week shoot, the mostly Australian crew – operating on different contracts – were only paid for work already done. A crew member who spoke to the Guardian on condition of anonymity said many of the crew had turned down other work opportunities for 2021, and were now without employment for the foreseeable future. “There are a lot of very upset film crew out here right now who have been told to just suck it up,” the source said. The Guardian is seeking comment from Netflix and the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance on the issue of severance pay for the production’s Australian crew. The series was enticed to Australia through the federal government’s $540m location incentive program, which allows overseas productions to recoup up to 13.5% of production expenses incurred in Australia. An additional and unspecified financial incentive was also pledged by the state government’s Made in NSW fund. Netflix said no Australian government incentives had been paid up front. “The location offset is based on what the actual qualifying spend is in Australia, and the additional location incentive is based on an estimate of the qualifying spend,” the statement said. “These incentives are not paid until the qualifying production expenditure is assessed and audited.” On Tuesday, a spokesperson for Australia’s communications and arts minister, Paul Fletcher, confirmed no funding had yet been paid to Netflix for God’s Favorite Idiot. “A final report on the production … has yet to be provided to the Office for the Arts which administers the location incentive on behalf of the government,” the spokesperson said. “Under standard practice of the location incentive funding, final payment is only made once final Australian expenditure is incurred on the production.” Announcing the $10m grant to Netflix in February, Fletcher said that God’s Favorite Idiot, which was to have continued production in Australia until November, was expected to inject more than $74m into the Australian economy. “These global productions continue to provide opportunities for the Australian screen industry,” Fletcher said at the time. “With the excellent reputation of our cast and crew, complemented by Australia’s careful management of Covid-19, the location incentive is generating return business that is growing and enhancing our sector.” The head of Screen NSW, Grainne Brunsdon, told the Guardian that the circumstances surrounding the Made in NSW contract with Netflix were commercial-in-confidence, but added that no money had changed hands. “It’s a rebate, so unless they meet certain performance criteria in the contract, there is no funding,” Brunsdon said. “The funding is always [conditional] on results.”","charCount":"3800","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/kelly-burke\">Kelly Burke</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2021/jun/08/in-brief-the-hummingbird-34-patients-kants-little-prussian-head-and-other-reasons-why-i-write","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-08T08:30:15Z","webTitle":"In brief: The Hummingbird; 34 Patients; Kant’s Little Prussian Head and Other Reasons Why I Write","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/jun/08/in-brief-the-hummingbird-34-patients-kants-little-prussian-head-and-other-reasons-why-i-write","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2021/jun/08/in-brief-the-hummingbird-34-patients-kants-little-prussian-head-and-other-reasons-why-i-write","fields":{"headline":"In brief: The Hummingbird; 34 Patients; Kant’s Little Prussian Head and Other Reasons Why I Write","standfirst":"<p>A deliciously playful Italian family saga; a doctor’s telling insights into his work; and Claire Messud’s masterly story of her life</p>","trailText":"A deliciously playful Italian family saga; a doctor’s telling insights into his work; and Claire Messud’s masterly story of her life","byline":"Hephzibah Anderson","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"acfb25dc68a4798410b97eca82284efdc8dffe1d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/acfb25dc68a4798410b97eca82284efdc8dffe1d/451_923_5928_3557/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The doctor will see you now: Tom Templeton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The doctor will see you now: Tom Templeton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<h2><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-hummingbird-9781474617468.html\">The Hummingbird</a></h2> <p><strong>Sandro Veronesi, translated by Elena Pala</strong><em><strong><br></strong></em><em>Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson,</em><em> </em><em>£14.99,</em><em> </em><em>pp304</em></p> <p>The phrase “summer reading” sometimes carries snobbish overtones, but this is the kind of novel that the season is made for: instantly immersive, playfully inventive, effortlessly wise.

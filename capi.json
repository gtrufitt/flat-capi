Let’s learn a little more about the two players involved.</p> <p><strong>Tamara Zidansek</strong> is the world No 85, and the true outsider of the four. The Slovenian had never been past the second round at a slam before this run, which began with a first-round comeback win over the No 6 seed, Bianca Andreescu. Zidansek has played in and lost two WTA Tour finals, both on clay, most recently in Colombia last month.</p> <p>Her opponent, <strong>Paula Badosa</strong>, was promoted to No 33 seed when Alison Riske withdrew. The former junior French Open champion is a rising star on clay, beating Sloane Stephens and Jelena Ostapenko on a run to the fourth round here in 2020. While her path to the quarters was eased by Naomi Osaka’s withdrawal, the Spaniard still had to overcome former finalist Marketa Vondrousova to reach the last eight.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60be94538f0837b8708e089f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-08T09:38:08.183Z\">10.38am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The quarter-finals begin at Roland Garros and while the biggest names feature later today or tomorrow, we start with a fascinating four-way battle to reach new heights. In the bottom half of the women’s draw, four players remain: Slovenia’s Tamara Zidansek, Spain’s Paula Badosa, Kazakhstan’s Elena Rybakina and her Russian doubles partner, Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. </p> <p>Of the quartet, only Pavlyuchenkova has reached a grand slam quarter-final before, and now one of them will be in the final on Saturday. Experience arguably makes Pavlyuchenkova the favourite but in truth, all four women will fancy their chances. Zidansek and Badosa are first up on Court Philippe-Chatrier.</p> <p>Later on, Alexander Zverev looks to continue his impressive form against the only man outside the top 10 seeds to reach the quarters: Spanish youngster Alejandro Davidovich Fokina. In the evening session Stefanos Tsitsipas takes on Daniil Medvedev, the No 2 seed who had never won a match here before this year.</p> </div>   </div>","wordcount":"4341","firstPublicationDate":"2021-06-08T09:40:59Z","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2021-06-08T15:28:39Z","liveBloggingNow":"true","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/p/hyg7v","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/b39abcdd5f49fedc45966fddfa1708c14fdbb6bf/0_48_3600_2160/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","isLive":"true","bodyText":"Third set: Rybakina 7-6 2-6 7-7 Pavlyuchenkova* (*denotes next server) A chance for Pavlyuchenkova here as she clubs a forehand winner into the corner for 0-30. Rybakina is under pressure, but twice digs out shots from under her feet, and gets a reprieve as Pav nets a return. A quite brilliant, reaching backhand down the line gets Rybakina over the line. Third set: Rybakina* 7-6 2-6 6-7 Pavlyuchenkova (*denotes next server) Pav tries to end a 20-shot rally with a drop shot, but Rybakina is onto it and tucks the winner away. More huge hitting from Pavlyuchenkova gets the job done. All of this is great news for Magda Linette and Bernarda Pera, who are due to play these two in the doubles tomorrow. Third set: Rybakina 7-6 2-6 6-6 Pavlyuchenkova* (*denotes next server) Niall here, jumping back in. This quarter-final, like the Zidansek v Badosa epic earlier, is going the distance as Rybakina holds to 15. No tie-breaks, remember. Third set: Rybakina* 7-6 2-6 5-6 Pavlyuchenkova (*denotes next server) And Pavlyuchenkova holds well, too, her shot for 40-0 a beaut. But back comes Rybakina. Pavlyuchenkova attempts an ace to seal it, and misses. The second serve is gobbled up. 40-30. Then Rybakina goes for glory and goes long, and a squeal from Pavlyuchenkova shows her delight. Third set: Rybakina 7-6 2-6 5-5* Pavlyuchenkova (*denotes next server) We begin with a fine return of serve for 0-15, then Rybakina whips a winner home for 15-15. Then she serves an ace. Then Pavlyuchenkova cannot keep her return in so it’s 40-15. Rybakina holds, and holds well. Third set: Rybakina* 7-6 2-6 4-5 *Pavlyuchenkova (*denotes next server) Sudden death is upon us, pretty much. Rybakina looks to the sky at a miscued return that lets her opponent off to readily. Then an attempted winner goes wide. A break point in the next would win this. Third set: Rybakina* 7-6 2-6 4-4 Pavlyuchenkova (*denotes next server) Rybakina powers back, her winner for 30-0 clanging off the racquet. Then Pavlyuchenkova’s engine gets her in place to bully a double forehand winner. It goes to 30-30 but an ace puts Rybakina in pole, and she scoops in an easy winner to level this set. Third set: Rybakina 7-6 2-6 3-4 *Pavlyuchenkova (*denotes next server) They are now slugging it out with each other, with Rybakina walloping a winner to level at 15-15. It goes to 30-30 - tiredness now also a factor - then 40-30. A hold for Pavlyuchenkova and one she audibly celebrates. Third set: Rybakina* 7-6 2-6 3-3 Pavlyuchenkova (*denotes next server) Levels, you devils. It goes to 30-30 and the potential for another wobble is upon us. Then a drop shot forces a break point as Rybakina can only scrabble into the net. And it happens, too. Third set: Rybakina 7-6 2-6 3-2 *Pavlyuchenkova (*denotes next server) Rybakina gains control, with a drop shot to go to 0-30 a real power move. She gets three break points, and Pavlyuchenkova goes long with an attempted saver. Another break. Third set: Rybakina* 7-6 2-6 2-2 Pavlyuchenkova (*denotes next server) Rybakina holds her serve well enough, and we are dead level in this final set. It’s anyone’s game at this point. Third set: Rybakina 7-6 2-6 1-2 *Pavlyuchenkova (*denotes next server) Rybakina is throwing so much at the shots, but seems to lack the rhythm to go with it. But at 15-30 there is a glimmer of a chance. It goes to two break points. The first is saved by a winner to the back of the court. The second is not saved. The Kazakh is back in this, the drought is over. Third set: Rybakina* 7-6 2-6 0-2 Pavlyuchenkova (*denotes next server) It goes to 0-30, and Pavlyuchenkova then climbs to 15-40. And a long backhand takes another break and a sixth successive game. Third set: Rybakina 7-6 2-6 0-1 *Pavlyuchenkova (*denotes next server) Pavlyuchenkova, still smeared in clay, seems to have the bit between her teeth. She’s eager to keep up her momentum, though a first double fault doesn’t much help and she is taken to deuce by a scything forehand winner from Rybakina. But she biffs a ball that bounces up to land game point. Then comes an ace down the line, taking the risk to win a fifth game in a row. Second set: Rybakina* 7-6 2-6 Pavlyuchenkova (*denotes next server) A double fault starts off the game, and then comes a whipping winner. Set points arrives on another break point. That’s seen off as Rybakina comes to the net. Then comes another as Pavlyuchenkova gains an advantage on deuce. And she takes it, to take the first set off Rybakina all tournament. Second set: Rybakina 7-6 2-5 *Pavlyuchenkova (*denotes next server) Pavlyuchenkova blazes through her next service game and has the next two games to win the second set. Rybakina seems to have lost concentration. Second set: Rybakina* 7-6 2-4 Pavlyuchenkova (*denotes next server) Break points on a previously all but unblemished serve. It goes to deuce but another chance comes up. That’s coughed up, and Pavlyuchenkova goes too long in trying to gobble it up. A series of deuces follow. Who will crack? Pavlyuchenkova thunders a double-handed backhand beyond reach before she then slips on the court as her opponent plays the shot and misses. She’s covered in shale, and there’s some talk of impeding in the commentary box but a break it is. Big chance now. Second set: Rybakina 7-6 2-3 *Pavlyuchenkova (*denotes next server) A racquet change from Rybakina as Pavlyuchenkova’s serve continues to impress. Rybakina goes long and it continues with serve. Second set: Rybakina* 7-6 2-2 Pavlyuchenkova (*denotes next server) Nice winner from Pavlyuchenkova to go 15-30 down but her opponent’s serve is strong and she works her own winner before acing the winner. Second set: Rybakina 7-6 1-2 *Pavlyuchenkova (*denotes next server) Again, Pavlyuchenkova looks strong on her serve. Another tiebreak here cannot be ruled out. Second set: Rybakina* 7-6 1-1 Pavlyuchenkova (*denotes next server) And Rybakina responds in kind, including a bullied smash to go 40-0 up, which is then served out. Second set: Rybakina 7-6 0-1 *Pavlyuchenkova (*denotes next server) Pavlyuchenkova blasts back, and serves out a hold of service to love. No sign of a wobble despite losing the first set. Rybakina steals into an early 2-0 lead, then an ace takes her to 3-0. She then clatters a winner for 4-0, then comes 5-0. A drinks break is taken at 5-1, and Pavlyuchenkova has a mountain to climb. A skidding backhand winner will do for starters but then it’s four set points. That’s collected on second serve. First set: Rybakina* 6-6 Pavlyuchenkova (*denotes next server) Farewell, Niall, and hello Cleveland. Neat net play from Pavlyuchenkova powers her way to 30-0 up, then a drop pulls Rybakina into it, before something of a fluke take her to game point. That’s served out and it’s a tiebreak. First set: Rybakina 6-5 Pavlyuchenkova* (*denotes next server) Rybakina has lost her way a little; from 4-1 up, she slips 0-30 down here but rescues things with some better first serves. Another double fault and we’re back to deuce. Pav goes down the line with a backhand, but misses – then nets a second serve. Time to hand over to John Brewin, who will guide you through this first set and beyond. First set: *Rybakina 5-5 Pavlyuchenkova (*denotes next server) Pavlyuchenkova grinds out a big-hitting hold, Rybakina still going for her shots and not always making them. 18 winners, 16 unforced errors from Rybakina. First set: Rybakina 5-4 Pavlyuchenkova* (*denotes next server) Nice work from Rybakina, stepping in behind her serve and lifting a two-handed backhand down the line. For every smooth winner, there’s a slightly wild miss, but she gets the hold and makes her opponent serve to stay in the set. First set: *Rybakina 4-4 Pavlyuchenkova (*denotes next server) The first signs of frustration from Rybakina at a missed winner, an eighth unforced error on her forehand. She had looked like running away with this set but Pavlyuchenkova has pulled level now. First set: Rybakina 4-3 Pavlyuchenkova* (*denotes next server) Pavlyuchenkova has stopped her doubles partner running away with this first set, but can she make a dent on her serve? A double fault, and soft second serve, allows Pav to move 15-30 ahead. Rybakina double-faults again but is let off as Pav loops a return long. A much better effort allows her to dominate at deuce, earning another break point – but Rybakina reads her and blasts a passing shot down the line. Pav does get the break as Rybakina goes long, and we’re back on serve. First set: *Rybakina 4-2 Pavlyuchenkova (*denotes next server) Rybakina is using her height advantage, stepping onto any mid-court balls and driving them away. Pav (yes, I’m calling her Pav) gets back in the game with a drop shot, then latches on to an underhit smash and whips it back across court. Rybakina returns the favour with a backhand down the line. Deuce, and Pav cranks up the power for a welcome hold. First set: Rybakina 4-1 Pavlyuchenkova* (*denotes next server) Pavlyuchenkova offers a reminder of what she can do with a backhand cross-court rocket at 15-40 down, but that’s all she can offer as Rybakina holds. First set: *Rybakina 3-1 Pavlyuchenkova (*denotes next server) Pavlyuchenkova sends a cross-court forehand wide, and is under pressure at 0-30. A limp, netted backhand brings up three break points for Rybakina. Pavlyuchenkova’s first serve isn’t firing but her second serve almost rescues her – until Rybakina dispatches a return into the far corner! First set: Rybakina 2-1 Pavlyuchenkova* (*denotes next server) Rybakina has found a better rhythm early on, her winner count already at eight as she holds comfortably. First set: *Rybakina 1-1 Pavlyuchenkova (*denotes next server) A solid opening service hold from Pavlyuchenkova, stifling a run of Rybakina winners with some big first serves. First set: Rybakina 1-0 Pavlyuchenkova* (*denotes next server) Pavlyuchenkova moves 0-30 up on the Rybakina serve but her opponent gets back to deuce, only for a nervy volley to offer up another break point. A short return allows Rybakina a routine winner, and a delicate drop shot helps her hold. Next up on Chatrier: Elena Rybakina takes on Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. There’s an eight-year gap between 29-year-old Pavlyuchenkova and Rybakina, who was born in Moscow but represents Kazakhstan. Improbably enough, the pair are doubles partners, and have a semi-final game together on Wednesday. Pavlyuchenkova has beaten Aryna Sabalenka and Victoria Azarenka on her way here, and is into her seventh grand slam quarter-final. The trouble is, she’s never made a semi-final. Rybakina is an emerging star who notably took out Serena Williams in the last 16 to reach the last eight at a slam for the first time. Tamara Zidansek speaks: “I was struggling a little bit [at the end of the second] but in the third set I managed to get my groove, and I was fighting really well.” Is she going to watch the next match? “A little bit ... I have some recovery to do, but I’ll keep an eye on it.” A terrific victory for the world No 85, who looks to have the game to climb much higher in the rankings. It’s Badosa’s turn to feel the tension now, and she sends a couple of tight forehands drifting beyond the lines. Suddenly, Zidansek has two match points. She misses a chance with the first, but senses Badosa is cracking, and powers a winner into the corner. She’s done it! What a ridiculous match this has been. For quality, drama and tension, it’s been better than plenty of grand slam finals. Third set: Zidansek 7-5, 4-6, 7-6 Badosa* (*denotes next server) Dogged defensive work from Zidansek this time, but she overcooks a sliced backhand and is under pressure at 15-30. Ack, the first serve is a mile off, and a double fault follows. Two break points ... the first saved with a ridiculous forehand smash down the line. And she does it again! Deuce ... and another double fault. She gets a lucky break, a forehand skidding off the service line. Another huge forehand winner, then a solid return from Badosa, and we are back to deuce. Badosa makes a mess of her cross-court return, but Zidansek nets that trusty drop shot. A seven-minute game now. Zidansek finds another long-range forehand winner and gets the better of the next rally, smashing the ball away to somehow hold serve! Third set: *Zidansek 7-5, 4-6, 6-6 Badosa (*denotes next server) Badosa opens with a zipping cross-court winner, then a double fault. A big serve and a flat volley into the corner gets her out of trouble. We’ve had 14 breaks of serve in this match, but none in the last eight games. Third set: Zidansek 7-5, 4-6, 6-5 Badosa* (*denotes next server) Badosa has found more consistency, cutting out the errors and making Zidansek win a lot more points. The Slovenian wins a key, 17-shot rally at 15-15 and closes out. Her resistance is getting to Badosa, who launches her racket towards her chair as a return flies wide. Third set: *Zidansek 7-5, 4-6, 5-5 Badosa (*denotes next server) No tie-breaks here; the first player to get two games ahead will win the match. Zidansek has the first chance but Badosa doesn’t give her a look in, going on the attack and powering to 40-0. A big first serve out wide seals a hold to love, and the pressure is back on her opponent. Third set: Zidansek 7-5, 4-6, 5-4 Badosa* (*denotes next server) Two hours on court, and these two still can’t be separated. Zidansek chooses the perfect time to land her first ace, and gets a comfortable hold with a trademark forehand winner. Third set: *Zidansek 7-5, 4-6, 4-4 Badosa (*denotes next server) Those last two points from Zidansek showed terrific touch, and she demonstrates it again here with a drop shot Badosa doesn’t bother chasing. Badosa’s turn to feel the nerves, and an eighth double fault follows – but a well-worked point gets her back to 30-all. At game point, she goes for her trusty double-handed backhand down the line – and misses. Badosa is doing just about enough on serve, though, and secures the hold with a deep slice that Zidansek floats back beyond the baseline. Third set: Zidansek 7-5, 4-6, 4-3 Badosa* (*denotes next server) The volume is rising from both players as we edge towards the two-hour mark. Badosa is finding the pace and power that eluded her early on, absolutely burying a winner at 30-15 down. Zidansek pounces on a net cord, finding the line with her forehand, and then brings out that tricky drop-volley again to edge back ahead. Third set: *Zidansek 7-5, 4-6, 3-3 Badosa (*denotes next server) From 2-0 up to 3-2 down, the pressure is now back on Badosa. She shakes it off, completing the hold with a cross-court volley and a triumphant, tension-relieving roar. Third set: Zidansek 7-5, 4-6, 3-2 Badosa* (*denotes next server) With Badosa wobbling on serve again and Zidansek rediscovering her accuracy, this feels very finely poised now. There are a lot more short points as the errors creep in, and Zidansek gets a welcome hold as Badosa’s return up the line drifts wide. Third set: *Zidansek 7-5, 4-6, 2-2 Badosa (*denotes next server) It’s crucial for Zidansek to keep in touch, because Badosa has already shown nerves on serve. Badosa starts well – a deft, sliding volley setting up 30-0 – but a delicate, cross-court drop shot from Zidansek changes the game. At break point, Badosa lands a risky backhand winner down the line, but Zidansek pulls out that drop shot again, and breaks back. That’s the 14th break of this match! Third set: Zidansek 7-5, 4-6, 1-2 Badosa* (*denotes next server) From 7-5, 4-2 up, Zidansek has lost six games on the spin, and badly needs to stop that run here. A crafty, angled drop shot turns the game her way at 15-30, and she gets the job done on second serve, Badosa’s return landing well wide. Third set: *Zidansek 7-5, 4-6, 0-2 Badosa (*denotes next server) Ramos gives Zidansek an informal warning over getting coaching from her team up in the stands. Badosa dishes up another double-fault, but rallies with a ferocious winner down the line. Zidansek has the chance to take it to deuce, but sends her volley a mile wide. She would have nailed that in the first two sets. Third set: Zidansek 7-5, 4-6, 0-1 Badosa* (*denotes next server) Here we go, then: the deciding set. Zidansek serves first and moves to 30-0 easily enough – but then Badosa strikes back, stepping forward to turn the game around and earn a break point. She takes it as Zidansek beams a forehand well wide. Second set: *Zidansek 7-5, 4-6 Badosa (*denotes next server) The change in body language is stark; Badosa is now bouncing around the court, with Zidansek looking deflated as she sends a hopeful backhand wide. Set point for Badosa, won with a whipped forehand that Zidansek can’t return. Second set: Zidansek 7-5, 4-5 Badosa* (*denotes next server) Zidansek has the weight of the world on her shoulders, and double-faults for the first time to go 0-30 behind. She tries to change it up with a drop shot, but it’s always falling short, and a wild forehand completes an almost zero-effort break for Badosa, who will now serve to level the match. Second set: *Zidansek 7-5, 4-4 Badosa (*denotes next server) At this point, both players would probably rather not be serving – and Badosa quickly slips 0-30 down. Some overly defensive play from Zidansek allows Badosa to bounce back, however, and a big first serve seals the hold. Second set: Zidansek 7-5, 4-3 Badosa* (*denotes next server) Tamara Zidansek is two games away now, but her struggles continue on first serve and some aggressive baseline play gets Badosa two break-back points. On second serve, Badosa’s deep return proves enough to earn another break – the fourth in a row. Second set: *Zidansek 7-5, 4-2 Badosa (*denotes next server) When Badosa has her opponent on the back foot, self-doubt seems to creep in. A wonky forehand is followed by a double fault, then a weak second serve which is ruthlessly put away by Zidansek. Three break points, and a break quickly gifted by Badosa, who is running out of games. Second set: Zidansek 7-5, 3-2 Badosa* (*denotes next server) Badosa senses a chance at 15-30, on Zidansek’s second serve. She pounds a return through her opponent, and seals the break as Zidansek, feeling the pressure, mishits. Back on serve in the second set! Second set: *Zidansek 7-5, 3-1 Badosa (*denotes next server) Paula Badosa has enjoyed a really impressive clay-court season, beating Ash Barty in Charleston, reaching the semi-finals in Madrid and then winning in Belgrade. It’s all in danger of ending with a whimper here, the fourth double-fault a lowlight as she hands over three break points. She saves the first, but a forehand down the line is just wide, and Zidansek is now in charge of this match. Second set: Zidansek 7-5, 2-1 Badosa* (*denotes next server) Zidansek holds to 15, sealed with another forehand winner, struck from a lofty angle deep into the far corner. Second set: *Zidansek 7-5, 1-1 Badosa (*denotes next server) A big game for Badosa, who has lost three games in a row and still seems distracted by the umpire’s call that started the run. She stops the losing run here, and we stay on serve. Second set: Zidansek 7-5, 1-0 Badosa* (*denotes next server) Zidansek was the better player in that first set, and continues to push Badosa around the court, securing the hold by stepping in behind her serve and wrongfooting her opponent. If you’re just joining us (I’ve always wanted to say that ...) it’s been a cracking match so far, with Zidansek bouncing back brilliantly after going a double-break down. Badosa has not quite found top gear but it’s been high-quality stuff, short on the nerves and unforced errors you might expect from two players in their first slam quarter-final. First set: *Zidansek 7-5 Badosa (*denotes next server) Badosa powers to 30-love, only for Zidansek to hit back with a looping forehand return. That punchy, precise forehand gets her to 30-all, and then a set point as Badosa fails to chase her down. Badosa saves the first but presents another when an awkward overhead effort goes wide. This time, Zidansek takes it when her opponent nets! First set: Zidansek 6-5 Badosa* (*denotes next server) Second serve is a weak spot for both players, and Badosa is all over it here, creaming it back down the line. Stepping off the baseline, she has a routine volley – but shanks it long! She shakes it off, winning a scrappy rally to set up deuce. Badosa thinks she’s found the line with a passing shot, and lets out a yell – only for the umpire to overturn the call. Zidansek secures the hold with a lovely long-range drop shot. First set: *Zidansek 5-5 Badosa (*denotes next server) Badosa is under pressure at 15-30 down but Zidansek gifts her a point with an unforced error. From there, an almighty heave into the corner and a low, skidding volley get Badosa over the line. First set: Zidansek 5-4 Badosa* (*denotes next server) Zidansek quickly moves to 40-15, but an unstoppable cross-court backhand gets Badosa back in the game. A rare unforced error takes us to deuce, where we are treated to the match’s best rally so far – won by Zidansek with a double-handed, cross-court backhand that clips the line! Zidansek leads for the first time. First set: *Zidansek 4-4 Badosa (*denotes next server) New balls on the Badosa serve, and Zidansek fires her seventh forehand winner. Badosa digs in, applying plenty of side spin to her first serve, but Zidansek secures the break with a couple of zipping volleys that her opponent can’t handle. It’s the sixth break of serve in eight games! First set: Zidansek 3-4 Badosa* (*denotes next server) Badosa turns up the pace and carves out another break point, which she takes with a crunching forehand that Zidansek can’t retrieve. This isn’t the freestyle poetry, by the way. Or is it? First set: *Zidansek 3-3 Badosa (*denotes next server) Not any more! Quite a remarkable change of momentum in this first set; Badosa has lost her rhythm while Zidansek is timing her shots perfectly. She breaks back again, and we are back on serve. First set: Zidansek 2-3 Badosa* (*denotes next server) Zidansek gets her first service hold, largely steering clear of Badosa’s fearsome forehand and stepping in behind her serve. She’s fought her way back into this, but Badosa still has a break. First set: *Zidansek 1-3 Badosa (*denotes next server) She’s finding it tough on her own serve, so Zidansek senses the need to get after her opponent. An aggressive return game pays off, bringing up three break points, and she only needs one as Badosa goes long. First set: Zidansek 0-3 Badosa* (*denotes next server) Zidansek can’t really match Badosa for pace early on, so has to find a different approach, mixing up her angles nicely. The pressure tells at deuce, Zidansek netting a forehand and then getting quickly overpowered in a rally. It’s been a flying start from Paula Badosa. First set: *Zidansek 0-2 Badosa (*denotes next server) Badosa has started really well here, cruising through her first service game and looking much more comfortable than her opponent. Early days, though. First set: Zidansek 0-1 Badosa* (*denotes next server) Zidansek makes a nervy start on serve and presents Badosa with an early break point. She doesn’t take the first chance but a firm forehand sets up another, taken with a backhand down the line. The players are out and warming up on a sunny Court Philippe-Chatrier. Carlos Ramos is the umpire; you might remember him from the 2018 US Open final. In other news, it appears that due to some pretty widespread technical problems, you’re probably not able to read this blog just now. At last, a chance to try out some of my freestyle poetry ... The first women’s quarter-final gets under way shortly. Let’s learn a little more about the two players involved. Tamara Zidansek is the world No 85, and the true outsider of the four. The Slovenian had never been past the second round at a slam before this run, which began with a first-round comeback win over the No 6 seed, Bianca Andreescu. Zidansek has played in and lost two WTA Tour finals, both on clay, most recently in Colombia last month. Her opponent, Paula Badosa, was promoted to No 33 seed when Alison Riske withdrew. The former junior French Open champion is a rising star on clay, beating Sloane Stephens and Jelena Ostapenko on a run to the fourth round here in 2020. While her path to the quarters was eased by Naomi Osaka’s withdrawal, the Spaniard still had to overcome former finalist Marketa Vondrousova to reach the last eight. The quarter-finals begin at Roland Garros and while the biggest names feature later today or tomorrow, we start with a fascinating four-way battle to reach new heights. In the bottom half of the women’s draw, four players remain: Slovenia’s Tamara Zidansek, Spain’s Paula Badosa, Kazakhstan’s Elena Rybakina and her Russian doubles partner, Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. Of the quartet, only Pavlyuchenkova has reached a grand slam quarter-final before, and now one of them will be in the final on Saturday. Experience arguably makes Pavlyuchenkova the favourite but in truth, all four women will fancy their chances. Zidansek and Badosa are first up on Court Philippe-Chatrier. Later on, Alexander Zverev looks to continue his impressive form against the only man outside the top 10 seeds to reach the quarters: Spanish youngster Alejandro Davidovich Fokina. In the evening session Stefanos Tsitsipas takes on Daniil Medvedev, the No 2 seed who had never won a match here before this year.","charCount":"25507","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/niall-mcveigh\">Niall McVeigh</a>  and <a href=\"profile/john-brewin\">John Brewin</a> (earlier)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/live/2021/jun/08/brexit-eustice-sausages-eu-northern-ireland-protocol-g7-covid-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-08T15:24:19Z","webTitle":"UK Covid live: Burnham calls for surge vaccination for Manchester amid 6,048 new cases across the country","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2021/jun/08/brexit-eustice-sausages-eu-northern-ireland-protocol-g7-covid-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/live/2021/jun/08/brexit-eustice-sausages-eu-northern-ireland-protocol-g7-covid-live","fields":{"headline":"UK Covid live: Burnham calls for surge vaccination for Manchester amid 6,048 new cases across the country","standfirst":"<p>Latest updates: mayor calls for rollout to be speeded up as latest figures show 60% weekly increase in new cases </p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/08/greater-manchester-and-lancashire-to-receive-emergency-covid-support\">Greater Manchester and Lancashire to receive emergency Covid support </a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/jun/08/teaching-unions-call-for-return-of-masks-to-classrooms-in-england-covid\">Teaching unions call for return of masks to classrooms in England </a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/08/tensions-rise-over-eu-trade-row-with-uk-over-sausage-sales\">Tensions rise over EU trade row with UK over sausage sales</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/jun/08/massive-internet-outage-hits-websites-including-amazon-govuk-and-guardian-fastly\">Massive internet outage hits websites including Amazon and Guardian</a><br></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus global updates – live</a></li></ul>","trailText":"Latest updates: mayor calls for rollout to be speeded up as latest figures show 60% weekly increase in new cases ","byline":"Andrew Sparrow","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fd6cd969c410e61ba5ccd552b07f76c26fdc44b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd6cd969c410e61ba5ccd552b07f76c26fdc44b3/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manchester mayor Andy Burnham receives his second dose of the Oxford AstraZeneca jab at the Etihad stadium.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Manchester mayor Andy Burnham receives his second dose of the Oxford AstraZeneca jab at the Etihad stadium.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard McCarthy/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<div id=\"block-60bf88b28f08336d75f06b17\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-08T15:24:19.033Z\">4.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Weekly Covid cases up 60%, latest figures show, as UK records 6,048 new infections</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The UK has recorded 6,048 new coronavirus cases, according to <a href=\"https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/\">the latest update</a> to the government’s Covid dashboard.

The Times reports:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, and Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, yesterday gave a briefing to ministers on the latest data that was described as “fairly grim”.</p> <p>They emphasised concerns about the rate of transmission of new strains of <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/newsletter-signup-coronavirus-msknld6s0\">coronavirus</a>, such as the Indian variant, and that vaccinations did not provide 100 per cent protection.

In <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/07/boris-johnson-minister-of-chaos/619010/\">a long profile published yesterday</a>, <strong>Boris Johnson </strong>was quoted as suggesting that politics is all about stories. “People live by narrative,” he told The Atlantic. “Human beings are creatures of the imagination.” And so, with tension with the EU over the implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol escalating (or non-implementation - the UK has unilaterally delayed implementing some of the rules it agreed), Johnson may be pleased that its version of the story references one of the great plot lines from the classic Whitehall comedy, Yes Minister. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/hendopolis/status/1402015634402295808\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">TELEGRAPH: Europe threatens sausage trade war <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TomorrowsPapersToday?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#TomorrowsPapersToday</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/uD1K21kZ4m\">pic.twitter.com/uD1K21kZ4m</a></p>&mdash; Neil Henderson (@hendopolis) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hendopolis/status/1402015634402295808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 7, 2021</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>If you don’t remember the Euro sausage episode, there are reminders <a href=\"https://twitter.com/voigtl1/status/1402158588508921858\">here </a>and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sundersays/status/1383385818966872070\">here.</a></p> <p>My colleague <strong>Daniel Boffey</strong>’s slightly more measured take on the story is here.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/jun/07/brexit-row-deepens-between-frost-and-eu-over-northern-ireland-protocol\">EU to make Northern Ireland concessions but says patience is ‘wearing thin’</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>George Eustice</strong>, the environment secretary, did an interview round this morning and he claimed the Northern Ireland protocol would make it impossible for traders to sell sausages from Great Britain in Northern Ireland. He told Sky News:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What you have to bear in mind is that the protocol always envisaged that both parties would show best endeavours to make the Northern Ireland protocol work, and that included recognising that Northern Ireland was an integral part of the UK and that you should support the free flow of goods to Northern Ireland.</p> <p>What we really need the EU to do is to respect that part of the protocol and put in place sensible measures to remove things like the nonsensical ban on selling sausages or chicken nuggets to Northern Ireland – not just requiring paperwork, but actually having an outright ban on some of those goods – that clearly doesn’t make sense.</p> </blockquote> <p>On the Today programme Eustice said this rule was “bonkers”. And on LBC he described it as a “nonsense”. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I suspect it links to some kind of perception that they can’t really trust any country other than an EU country to make sausages. I think that’s a nonsense. I think we’ve got a very good sausage industry in this country, we’ve got the highest standards of food hygiene in the world.</p> </blockquote> <p>The UK did, of course, agree to these rules when it signed the protocol. Asked to justify this, Eustice argued that the protocol also included a commitment that both sides would use their best endeavours to ensure goods can flow from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. He said the EU should be more willing to look for solutions. He told the Today programme:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are lots of ways to give the European Union the assurance that they say they want for their single market, and what we should be doing is working together to identify ways forward. And that’s where the European Union have been quite slow to date to engage.</p> </blockquote> <p>He also suggested that, if this becomes an issue at this week’s G7 summit, President Biden might side with the UK.

But Eustice said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I suspect that any US administration would be amazed if you were to say, for instance, that a sausage from Texas couldn’t be sold to California, there would be an outright ban – they really wouldn’t understand how that could even be contemplated.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here is the agenda for the day.<br></p> <p><em>9.30am:</em> Boris Johnson chairs cabinet.</p> <p><em>9.30am: </em>The ONS publishes its weekly death figures for England and Wales.</p> <p><em>9.30am:</em> Bill Crothers, who worked for Greensill Capital for a period while still chief commercial officer at the Cabinet Office, gives evidence to the Commons public administration and constitutional affairs committee.</p> <p><em>11.30am:</em> Matt Hancock, the health secretary, takes questions in the Commons.</p> <p><em>12pm:</em> Downing Street is expected to hold its daily lobby briefing.</p> <p><em>After 2pm: </em>Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, makes a statement on Covid to the Scottish parliament.</p> <p><em>After 2.30pm: </em>MPs begin an emergency debate on cuts to the aid budget.

It is only the second time daily new cases have been above 6,000 since March. This means the total number of new cases over the past seven days is now 60.6% up on the total for the previous week. Yesterday the week-on-week increase was 52.9%. And the UK has also recorded 13 more deaths, with the seven-day death total up 67.4% on the total for the previous week. But because the daily death totals are so low, this figure tends to fluctuate quite considerably. Yesterday deaths were up just 1.7% week on week. On Sunday they were down week on week by 1.7%. In her speech to the Scottish parliament Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, also confirmed that if the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation did recommend vaccination for teenagers, the Scottish government would accept that recommendation. She told MSPs: The Scottish government is now awaiting advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation on the vaccination of children in those age groups. I’m sure everyone would agree that it is vital that we continue to rely on expert advice in all of our vaccination decisions. However, vaccination may very well be a really important way of giving children greater protection, minimising any further disruption to schooling, and also further reducing community transmission of the virus. And so I can confirm that if the JCVI does recommend the use of the vaccine for children aged 12 and over, we will move as quickly as practically possible to implement their advice. Yesterday Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said the JCVI advice on vaccinating teenagers would be available within weeks. Unlike Sturgeon, he did not commit the government to going ahead with vaccination for teenagers if the JCVI recommends it. He just said the government would “listen” to that advice. In the Commons Theresa May, the Conservative former prime minister, has just finished speaking in the debate on cuts to the aid budget. She said she was opposed to the cuts for three reason. First, like all Conservative MPs, she stood on a manifesto saying the party was “proudly” committed to maintaining the target of spending 0.7% of national income on aid. She said she accepted that the Covid pandemic had hit government finances. But ministers are saying the economy will bounce back, she said. Second, she said she was particularly committed to tackling modern slavery, and she said the cuts would reduce funding for the global fund to tackle modern slavery by 80%. One impact of that would be to cut the money available to combat the commercial sexual exploitation of children, she said. And, third, she said the cuts would damage the UK’s standing in the world. Bill Crothers, the former government chief commercial officer who became an adviser to Greensill Capital while still working as a civil servant has insisted there was no conflict of interest, PA Media reports. PA says: Crothers told MPs on the public administration and constitutional affairs committee that his intention was to follow the rules “in spirit and in form” when appointed to Lex Greensill’s collapsed financial services firm. Links between Greensill Capital, the government and David Cameron have come under scrutiny amid controversy over the former prime minister’s lobbying on behalf of the firm. Crothers began advising Greensill in September 2015 but remained in his civil service role until November that year, after which he carried on working for the financial services firm. The businessman told MPs: “My intention was to completely follow the rules, in spirit and in form. I was transparent in all that I did and no conflict happened.” Crothers, who had a long career at Accenture before moving to Whitehall, said it was always his intention to return to the private sector and that he had expressed this to colleagues. He said that after eight years in the civil service, his initial plan was to leave the position of chief commercial officer and immediately contract back as an adviser, while also becoming an adviser with Greensill. But Crothers said that the Whitehall ethics chief at the time, Sue Gray, advised that it would be more appropriate instead to become a part-time civil servant while taking on the Greensill role. “In the press, the phrase ‘double-hatting’ has been used, and I just feel that is not appropriate - this was a transitional arrangement,” he told MPs. Plans to allow an NHS system to extract patient data from doctors’ surgeries in England have been delayed amid concerns around privacy, PA Media reports. Mass gatherings of thousands of Euro 2020 fans in Glasgow will go ahead, despite an increase in cases of 50% across Scotland in the past week alone. Humza Yousaf, Scotland’s health secretary, told MSPs this afternoon that, while he understood concerns about the fan zones, where up to 6,000 people a day can gather to watch the matches on Glasgow Green and testing is not mandatory, this would be an “outdoor, highly regulated space”. He added that people attending were being encouraged to take lateral flow tests in advance, and that permission for the events could be withdrawn at the last moment if the situation changed. Significant concerns have been raised about these gatherings since Glasgow came out of nine months’ of lockdown restrictions only last weekend, with hospitality groups warning that businesses will not survive a further tightening of rules if cases rise again. Making her weekly Covid statement immediately after Yousaf spoke, Nicola Sturgeon said that there was “encouraging evidence” that the length of time people were spending in hospital with Covid was reducing. She also announced that more than half of the adult population in Scotland has now had two doses. She said: Just as we all hoped, vaccination may well be giving us more scope to ease restrictions, and reduce the social, economic and wider health harms that the response to the virus so far has caused. The statements took place as owners of soft play centres protested outside the parliament and threatened legal action over restrictions which mean these centres must remain closed in many parts of the country. Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross also raised perceived inconsistencies around limits on numbers at weddings, christenings and funerals, as well as parents of children moving up to primary school not being allowed to attend nursery graduation ceremonies this month. He compared all these restrictions with the fan zones going ahead without mandatory testing. Sturgeon said that such decisions required judgement as well as clinical advice and the ability to sometimes say things people didn’t want to hear. She said that the particular characteristics of soft play centres, being indoors, meant they did still pose a risk, but that these businesses could open once areas have moved into level 1, which some did last weekend. In the Commons Andrew Mitchell, the Conservative former international development secretary, is now opening the emergency debate on the cuts to the aid budget. He started by praising the Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, for his call yesterday for MPs to get a binding vote on the cuts. It was one of the strongest statements he had heard from a Speaker, he said. Mitchell also said that he would not be pushing for a vote today because, like the Speaker, he wants a binding vote. The government would be able to ignore any vote today, and the motion is a neutral one anyway (“that this house has considered the matter of the 0.7% official development assistance target”). He also said that although he and other Tories opposed to the aid cuts had been described as “rebels”, it was in fact the government who were the “rebels” because they were the ones defying the Tory manifesto pledge not to cut aid spending. At his press conference Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, urged the government to speed up vaccine supplies to his region to allow it to run a “surge vaccination programme”. Referring to the measures announced by Matt Hancock earlier (see 12.38pm), Burnham said: Obviously what we’re seeing here is a localised approach to messaging, more localised support on testing and on tracing and isolation. We are also saying that also should apply to vaccination. We are not asking for any more vaccine here than our fair share, what we are asking for is the bringing forward of Greater Manchester’s supplies so that we can run a surge vaccination programme over the next three weeks. Burnham said accelerating vaccinations would “allow us to go further and faster in those areas where we need to drive the take-up, where those case rates are highest”. He said that if Greater Manchester could get more vaccine doses, “we are very confident that we will have the tools that we need to turn the rising cases around”. He went on: And that’s not just about protecting Greater Manchester, it is of course about protecting the whole country from the wider spread of the Delta variant. Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, has been holding a press conference. He said that, although Greater Manchester is now one of the Covid hotspots where the government is advising people to minimise travel in and out (see 12.30pm), this was “not a lockdown” and not a travel ban. For more detail on what he said, there is good coverage on the Manchester Evening News’s live blog. On Radio 4’s The World at One Eamonn O’Brien, the Labour leader of Bury council, said that the surge testing for the Greater Manchester area announced today (see 12.38pm) should have come sooner. He told the programme: I’m a little bit disappointed it hasn’t come sooner. We have been discussing this as a request for some weeks now and obviously we’ve seen it work in Bolton. So we were very keen on making as quick a start as possible in other parts of Greater Manchester, especially my borough of Bury because it neighbours Bolton. We would like to see a commitment that we get our vaccination supply bought forward so we can vaccinate far more people as quickly as possible which is of course one of the best ways we’ve got at the moment to protect people from any new variants and any surge that we’re seeing. Public Health Wales said there are now 178 cases of the Delta variant in Wales, an increase of 81 cases since 3 June. It said: The organisation is alerting the public that Wales may slowly be beginning to experience localised community transmission of the variant, with increasing evidence of cases with no travel history. The majority of the Delta cases in Wales have been focused around a cluster of cases in north Wales and a cluster of cases in south Wales, but we are also starting to see unlinked cases in these areas and elsewhere in Wales. Dr Giri Shankar, incident director at PHW, said though the increase of variant cases was expected it was still “concerning” to see. He said: The increase is likely to be driven in part by the transmissibility of the variant, which we know is easier to catch than the previously dominant Alpha variant. However, increased mixing also contributes to transmission, and this may be playing a part too. The spread of the Delta variant in Wales is a reminder that we should not become complacent, even as rates of coronavirus across Wales remain low. Dr Sakthi Karunanithi, director of public health for Lancashire county council, said today cases in the county are continuing to rise at a “worrying pace”. He said: Over the past three weeks, additional surge testing and vaccinations has been undertaken in Burnley, and we have been pushing for this to be rolled out across the county. The government has listened to our calls and has now agreed to provide Lancashire with enhanced support, which gives us more flexibility to fight this new wave of infections. As such, asymptomatic PCR testing will be opened up to everyone in Lancashire. Improving vaccination uptake is also going to be a crucial element in our efforts to contain this latest wave. Edwin Poots, the new DUP leader, has announced, as expected (see 11.54am), that he is proposing Paul Givan for first minister. Although Poots has replaced Arlene Foster as DUP leader, he has chosen not to become first minister himself so that he can instead focus on party matters. The BBC’s Gareth Gordon has a profile of Givan here. Here is a full summary of the main points from the Downing Street lobby briefing. Downing Street accused the EU of adopting a “purist approach” to implementing the Northern Ireland protocol. Asked about the dispute with the EU about the protocol, which has been exacerbated by the UK unilaterally failing to implement some of its obligations under the deal, which governs trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and which is intended to protect the EU single market (which now includes Northern Ireland), the PM’s spokesman said: The protocol was a compromise. We didn’t expect the EU to take such a purist approach when implementing it. The protocol itself explicitly says the EU and UK shall use their best endeavours to facilitate the trade between Northern Ireland and other parts of the UK, and that’s the approach we would expect them to take and have been working towards. Boris Johnson is routinely accused of ignoring rules that he finds inconvenient and one suspects this is a line that he may apply in other areas. For example, on the basis of this report, he might argue that the parliamentary commissioner for standards is applying a “purist approach” to his own declaration about who paid for his Christmas 2018 Caribbean holiday. The spokesman said there was “no case whatsoever” for the rule saying that from July chilled meats produced in Great Britain should not be sold in Northern Ireland. Asked if the PM agreed with George Eustice, the environment secretary, who this morning described the rule as “bonkers” (see 9.21am), the spokesman said: There’s no case whatsoever for preventing chilled meats from being sold to Northern Ireland, and any ban would be contrary to the aims of the protocol and the interests of the people of Northern Ireland ... We think an urgent solution needs to be found. And obviously there are meetings, starting tomorrow morning. (See 10.06am.) The spokesman also said the UK had sent more than 10 papers to the European commission proposing “potential solutions on a wide range of issues”, but that it had yet to receive a written response. Even though No 10 now says there is no case for this rule, the government did agree to it when it signed the protocol. (See 12.12pm.) The spokesman did not rule out the UK deciding to unilaterally extend the exemption for chilled meats under the protocol that is due to lapse at the end of June. Asked if the UK might unilaterally extend this (which would be in defiance of the agreement), the spokesman said: We’re working very hard to try and resolve these issues consensually and we’re looking forward to the joint committee tomorrow. The prime minister has always made clear we will consider all our options in meeting our responsibility to sustain peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland. The spokesman rejected claims that the government signed the protocol with the intention of just ignoring its inconvenient aspects. Yesterday Gavin Barwell, the former Tory MP who served as Theresa May’s chief of staff between 2017 and 2019, made this claim on Twitter. Asked if Barwell’s analysis was correct, the spokesman replied: No. The protocol was designed as a delicate balance. It was formed in a spirit of compromise in challenging circumstances. The text itself makes clear that it’s not a finished solution. Downing Street rejected the Commons Speaker’s call for MPs to get a vote on the cut to the aid budget. Asked if the government would allow a vote on this, the spokesman said the government was acting in accordance with the International Development (Official Development Assistance Target) Act 2015, which allows the aid budget to be cut in exceptional circumstances. He went on: “There are certainly no plans to bring forward a vote.” The spokesman said Boris Johnson told cabinet this morning that “while the relationship between cases and hospitalisations has changed, we must continue to look at the data carefully ahead of making a decision on step 4 [further lockdown easing]”. The spokesman refused to endorse George Eustice’s suggestion in an interview this morning that people should not travel abroad on holiday this year. (See 11.18am.) Asked about the comment, the spokesman said that in other interviews Eustice made it clear that people could travel to countries on the green list. The spokesman went on: [Eustice] set out the advice as it is, there is a green list of destinations where it is possible to travel overseas, people may choose to do so if they wish, otherwise we would advise against travel to amber and red list countries. The spokesman sought to clarify what Eustice meant when he said this morning that the US would never accept a situation where “a sausage from Texas couldn’t be sold to California”. (See 9.21am.) Eustice was wrong about this, because in the US regulations on what can be sold do differ between states. (See 12.12pm.) The spokesman said the point Eustice was making was with regard to “another country being able to impose rules within the territorial boundaries of a country”. The spokesman said the Cabinet Office was investigating “as a matter of urgency” the internet outage that brought down the gov.uk website this morning, as well as many others (including the Guardian’s). At the Downing Street lobby briefing, asked about the row with the EU about the implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol, the prime minister’s spokesman complained that Brussels was taking a “purist approach” to enforcing it. He said: The protocol was a compromise. We didn’t expect the EU to take such a purist approach when implementing it. The protocol itself explicitly says the EU and UK shall use their best endeavours to facilitate the trade between Northern Ireland and other parts of the UK, and that’s the approach we would expect them to take and have been working towards. I will post a full summary of the briefing shortly. One in every 50 secondary school students in England was absent for Covid-related reasons before the half-term break because of a huge rise in children self-isolating, according to the latest figures compiled by the Department for Education. The DfE said there were 4,000 children in state schools with confirmed cases of Covid-19 on 27 May, the same as the previous week, but the number off school with suspected cases rose to 19,000, while the number self-isolating because of contacts within their school rocketed from 60,000 to 90,000, a 50% increase in seven days. In contrast the number of pupils self-isolating because of contacts outside schools rose from 22,000 to 26,000. In secondary schools 2% of all pupils were absent for Covid-related reasons, while 1.6% in primary schools were also absent. Total school absences also rose but those statistics are muddied by some areas taking half-term holiday a week earlier than others, and because in some schools year 11 and year 13 students had departed on study leave. Schools in the north-west were particularly hard hit. In Bolton, 21% of primary and 31% of secondary pupils were absent for Covid-related reasons, among high rates of absence overall, while in Blackburn with Darwen 15% of primary and 13% of secondary pupils were absent. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has now told the Commons that surge testing is being extended in Greater Manchester and Lancashire in response to the rise in Covid cases they are seeing. (See 12.23pm and 12.30pm.) He said: I can tell the house that today working with local authorities, we are providing a strengthened package of support based on what’s working in Bolton, to help Greater Manchester and Lancashire tackle the rise in the Delta variant that we’re seeing there. This includes rapid response teams, putting in extra testing, military support and supervised in school testing. I want to encourage everyone in Manchester and Lancashire to get the tests on offer. We know that this approach can work, we’ve seen it work in south London and in Bolton in stopping a rise in the number of cases. This is the next stage of tackling the pandemic in Manchester and in Lancashire, and of course it’s vital that people in these areas - as everywhere else - come forward and get the jab as soon as they’re eligible because that is our way out of this pandemic together. Jennifer Williams from the Manchester Evening News says the government’s website had been update to include the whole of Greater Manchester and Lancashire in those Covid hotspot areas where people are encouraged to minimise travel in and out. This is from Ian Jones from PA Media. John Campbell, the BBC’s economics and business editor for Northern Ireland, has posted a useful Twitter thread on what George Eustice was saying about the Northern Ireland protocol this morning. (See 9.21am.) He is surprised that Eustice only now seems to be speaking out about the sausage issue, and he says Eustice was wrong in what he said about the US. The new DUP leader, Edwin Poots, is set to name his new Stormont ministerial team as the party attempts to recover from a number of resignations, PA Media reports. PA says: Poots is meeting selected party members ahead of the announcements being made throughout Tuesday. The roles will be designate at this stage, with the appointments post-dated to take effect later. The current first minister, Arlene Foster, previously indicated that she will stand down when Poots names a new ministerial team. But Poots said Foster will remain as first minister to lead a British-Irish Council meeting in her home constituency of Fermanagh on Friday. It has been widely speculated that Lagan Valley MLA Paul Givan will be named as the new first minister designate. The new appointments come as the DUP has been left reeling by a number of resignations. The latest member to leave described the “mind-blowing arrogance” of some during a meeting to ratify the appointment of the new leader. These are from Dmitry Grozoubinski, a trade specialist and founder of the ExplainTrade consultancy, on the row between the UK and the EU over the Northern Ireland protocol. In interviews this morning, as well as talking about sausage trade wars with the EU, George Eustice, the environment secretary, also urged people to holiday at home this year because of Covid. He told Sky News: Our advice has been don’t travel unless it’s absolutely necessary. Obviously we had hoped, with these three categories that we had, we had hoped that situation would be improving in other parts of the world, that we’d be able to progressively add other countries to the green list. Sadly, that’s not the situation, we do have this new variant of concern first identified in India that is now cropping up in other countries, and we’ve just got to take a very cautious approach. Eustice said that he would be staying at home this year and that he had “no intention of travelling or going on a holiday abroad this summer”. In fact, although the government used to advise people against non-essential travel abroad, that guidance was changed on 17 May. Since then the government has not opposed people going on holiday to green list countries. But Eustice’s comments will nevertheless be seen as a sign that the green list is not expected to be widely opened up any time soon. Young people are increasingly confident about getting a Covid vaccine, Dr Nikki Kanani, director of primary care at NHS England, said this morning. She told BBC Breakfast: More than four in five 40 to 49-year-olds have had their first dose and two-thirds of 30 to 39-year-olds have already had theirs, and that is still going to increase, of course, as people come forward, so uptake remains high. We had additional polling over the weekend that shows that the confidence in the vaccine has increased by a fifth - by 20% - in those under-40s. On Thursday Matt Hancock, the health secretary, will give evidence to the Commons health and science committees, who are holding a joint inquiry into the government’s handling of the Covid crisis. Some of the questions will relate to the many and damning criticisms of Hancock made by Dominic Cummings, the former chief adviser to the prime minister, when he gave evidence to the inquiry last month. The MPs were particularly shocked by Cummings’ claim that Hancock had repeatedly lied about what his department was doing, and they asked Cummings to provide written evidence to back up his allegations. Jeremy Hunt, the health committee chair, told Times Radio this morning that Cummings has yet to submit that evidence. He said: Well, obviously, Dominic Cummings made some very serious allegations against [Hancock] in particular, saying that he lied repeatedly. So we will put those allegations to him, but we haven’t received the written evidence to back those claims up that we were expecting. But we’ll be putting all those allegations to [Hancock] to give him his rightful chance to respond. According to today’s Times splash (paywall), ministers are considering delaying by a fortnight the full lifting of Covid restrictions in England originally scheduled for 21 June after receiving a “fairly grim” briefing from scientists. The Times reports: Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, and Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, yesterday gave a briefing to ministers on the latest data that was described as “fairly grim”. They emphasised concerns about the rate of transmission of new strains of coronavirus, such as the Indian variant, and that vaccinations did not provide 100 per cent protection. Millions of Britons remain unvaccinated. One cabinet source said they expected a delay of “between two weeks and a month” but suggested that the political fallout was likely to be limited as long as the full reopening took place before the start of the school summer holidays late next month. Jeremy Hunt, the Conservative chair of the Commons health committee, told Sky News this morning that a two-week delay would be acceptable. He said: I think the most important thing is that, when we lift this lockdown or these restrictions, we want to know that it’s forever, that we can finally get our freedom back and it’s not going to change. If we had to wait a couple of extra weeks because that was the scientific advice, I think most people would say that’s reasonable. Only 1% of deaths registered in England and Wales in the week ending Friday 28 May involved coronavirus, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics. There were 95 deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate - out of 9,628 deaths in total. That is the lowest daily total since the first week of September. The total number of deaths for the last week of May was also 3.1% below the five-year average for deaths at this time of year. The dispute between the UK and the EU over the implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol will be thrashed out tomorrow at a meeting in London between Lord Frost, the Brexit minister, and Maroš Šefčovič, the European commission vice president. It’s the first meeting of the joint partnership council, set up to oversee the implementation of the EU-UK trade deal, combined with a meeting of the joint committee, set up to oversee the operation of the Northern Ireland protocol. In an article for the Daily Telegraph, Šefčovič suggests that the EU is finding it hard to trust the UK because of the government’s decision earlier this year to unilaterally delay implementing aspects of the deal. He says there have been “numerous and fundamental gaps in the UK’s implementation”, and he starts his article: The prolific English hymn composer Isaac Watts once said: “Learning to trust is one of life’s most difficult tasks.” And yet it is also one of the most important tasks when it comes to building a productive, enduring and mutually beneficial partnership. As I travel to London today, it is clear that this week will be a defining one for consolidating trust between the European Union and the United Kingdom. And in a comment that led to the Telegraph writing up the story under the headline “Europe threatens sausage trade war”, Šefčovič says the EU will act “firmly” if the UK does not agree deadlines for complying with its obligations. He says: Mutually agreed compliance paths, with concrete deadlines and milestones for the UK to fulfil its existing obligations, would therefore be an important stepping stone – and, I believe, a credible outcome of this joint committee. If this does not happen, and if the UK takes further unilateral action over the coming weeks, the EU will not be shy in reacting swiftly, firmly and resolutely to ensure that the UK abides by its international law obligations. Good morning. In a long profile published yesterday, Boris Johnson was quoted as suggesting that politics is all about stories. “People live by narrative,” he told The Atlantic. “Human beings are creatures of the imagination.” And so, with tension with the EU over the implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol escalating (or non-implementation - the UK has unilaterally delayed implementing some of the rules it agreed), Johnson may be pleased that its version of the story references one of the great plot lines from the classic Whitehall comedy, Yes Minister. If you don’t remember the Euro sausage episode, there are reminders here and here. My colleague Daniel Boffey’s slightly more measured take on the story is here. George Eustice, the environment secretary, did an interview round this morning and he claimed the Northern Ireland protocol would make it impossible for traders to sell sausages from Great Britain in Northern Ireland. He told Sky News: What you have to bear in mind is that the protocol always envisaged that both parties would show best endeavours to make the Northern Ireland protocol work, and that included recognising that Northern Ireland was an integral part of the UK and that you should support the free flow of goods to Northern Ireland. What we really need the EU to do is to respect that part of the protocol and put in place sensible measures to remove things like the nonsensical ban on selling sausages or chicken nuggets to Northern Ireland – not just requiring paperwork, but actually having an outright ban on some of those goods – that clearly doesn’t make sense. On the Today programme Eustice said this rule was “bonkers”. And on LBC he described it as a “nonsense”. He said: I suspect it links to some kind of perception that they can’t really trust any country other than an EU country to make sausages. I think that’s a nonsense. I think we’ve got a very good sausage industry in this country, we’ve got the highest standards of food hygiene in the world. The UK did, of course, agree to these rules when it signed the protocol. Asked to justify this, Eustice argued that the protocol also included a commitment that both sides would use their best endeavours to ensure goods can flow from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. He said the EU should be more willing to look for solutions. He told the Today programme: There are lots of ways to give the European Union the assurance that they say they want for their single market, and what we should be doing is working together to identify ways forward. And that’s where the European Union have been quite slow to date to engage. He also suggested that, if this becomes an issue at this week’s G7 summit, President Biden might side with the UK. Until now Biden has effectively been siding with the EU, warning that Britain’s stance could undermine the Good Friday peace agreement. But Eustice said: I suspect that any US administration would be amazed if you were to say, for instance, that a sausage from Texas couldn’t be sold to California, there would be an outright ban – they really wouldn’t understand how that could even be contemplated. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Boris Johnson chairs cabinet. 9.30am: The ONS publishes its weekly death figures for England and Wales. 9.30am: Bill Crothers, who worked for Greensill Capital for a period while still chief commercial officer at the Cabinet Office, gives evidence to the Commons public administration and constitutional affairs committee. 11.30am: Matt Hancock, the health secretary, takes questions in the Commons. 12pm: Downing Street is expected to hold its daily lobby briefing. After 2pm: Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, makes a statement on Covid to the Scottish parliament. After 2.30pm: MPs begin an emergency debate on cuts to the aid budget. The motion is a neutral one – “that this house has considered the matter of the 0.7% official development assistance target” – and there will be no division at the end.

Deputy governor Sir Dave Ramsden told the Guardian that the bank was alert to signs of rising inflation:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is a risk that demand gets ahead of supply and that will lead to a more generalised pick-up in inflationary pressure.

Reuters explains: “We’ve still got more than 3 million workers on furlough across the UK, and that means that uncertainties about the future jobs market remain pretty acute,” he said. While government figures last week showed 3.4 million jobs were on furlough at the end of April, more timely survey data from the Office for National Statistics suggested the number had dropped to 2.1 million by mid-May. One solution to the UK’s red-hot housing market is to build more houses -- and address the imbalance between supply and demand. Otherwise, the boom is going to create deeper economic inequality, hurting those - particularly younger people - who aren’t able to afford a mortgage to get onto the housing ladder. Bloomberg explains: Bank of England Chief Economist Andy Haldane said the U.K. housing market is “on fire” and contributing to a growing wealth gap -- but there’s little that the central bank can do to fix structural issues. “As things stand, the housing market in the U.K. is on fire,” Haldane said at an event about inequality on Tuesday. “There’s a significant imbalance between incipient demand and available supply of houses, and because the laws of economic gravity have not been suspended, the result is pretty punchy rises in house prices.” The remarks underscore concerns about the impact that rising property prices are having on the ability of younger people and those on moderate wages to own their own home. Haldane said the structural issues in the market that are feeding the increase aren’t something central banks can fix. Without “doing something of a longstanding nature with the supply side of the U.K. housing market,” Haldane said, “inevitably we’ll see the sort of relentless rise in house prices relative to incomes that we’ve seen over the past 30 to 40 years.” More here. Andy Haldane’s warning that the UK housing market is on fire is backed up by the facts. Yesterday, Halifax reported that the average cost of a home rose by 1.3% in May alone - lifting the average selling price to a record £261,743. That’s a rise of 9.5% in the last year, far outstripping wage growth. Halifax predicted they could keep climbing due to the shortage of property, and strong demand for larger houses, better suited for homeworking, in more rural areas and sporting a garden. The large savings build up by some households is also pushing prices up, while record low interest rates make servicing a mortgage less expensive than in the past. A week ago, Nationwide said that a ‘race for space’ was driving double-digit growth in property prices, with younger buyers as keen on living in the country than in a big city. Online estate agent Rightmove has reported that a ‘mini boom’ is underway, fuelled by the government’s stamp duty holiday, particularly in Wales and the North West. And in March, mortgage lending hit a record high. Borrowers raced to beat the original deadline for the stamp duty tax break on purchases up to £500,000 (which was then extended until the end of June, and will drop to £250,000 until the end of September.). We know that the Bank of England is carefully monitoring Britain’s booming housing market. Deputy governor Sir Dave Ramsden told the Guardian that the bank was alert to signs of rising inflation: There is a risk that demand gets ahead of supply and that will lead to a more generalised pick-up in inflationary pressure. That’s something we are absolutely going to guard against. We are looking carefully at the housing market and a raft of real-term indicators. The number of job vacancies in the US has hit a record peak, as demand for labor surges as America’s economy recovers. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics has reported there were 9.28m job vacancies in the US in April, up from 8.2m in March, and the most since the survey began in December 2000. The ‘quits’ rate, which tracks how many people are choosing to leave their position, rose to 2.7% - the highest in the survey’s history too. Hospitality industries saw the largest increase in vacancies -- following the reopening of bars and restaurants as pandemic restrictions were eased this spring. The BLS says: Job openings increased in a number of industries with the largest increases in accommodation and food services (+349,000), other services (+115,000), and durable goods manufacturing (+78,000). The number of job openings decreased in educational services (-23,000) and in mining and logging (-8,000). The number of job openings increased in all four regions. Such a sharp jump in vacancies suggests the US labor market is tightening, and that firms are struggling to find staff. Last week’s Non-Farm Payroll show that recruitment slowed in April, with just 278,000 new hires (rising to 559,000 in May). But that still left more than seven million jobs still to recover, compared to pre-pandemic levels. Federal Reserve policymakers pay close attention to the JOLTS numbers for indications of labor market slack. This surge in vacancies will probably lead to more calls for more states to stop paying the extra $300 per week in unemployment benefits. But, it may also be a sign that US firms need to raise wages to attract staff. Plus, not everyone has been vaccinated -- and some workers find that childcare and other responsibilities are making it harder to return to work. Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane has said the UK’s housing market is “on fire”. This is due to government incentives for buyers, more demand from households that have accumulated greater savings during the pandemic, and a shortage of homes for sale, Haldane says. He added that the rise in house prices, which topped 10% in the 12 months to March according to official data, was likely to worsen pre-existing wealth inequalities. Speaking at a webinar on inequality organised by the University of Glasgow, Haldane said: As things stand, the housing market in the UK is on fire. The opening bell has rung on Wall Street, and stocks have inched higher, with the Nasdaq getting a boost from a rise in Tesla shares. Dow Jones up 15 points 34,645 S&amp;P 500 up 8 points, or 0.2%, at 4,235 Nasdaq up 64 points, or 0.47%, at 13,946 The Football Association has appointed the first female chair in its 157-year history, with the business executive Debbie Hewitt expected to take up the position in January. The appointment is subject to confirmation by the FA Council next month, but if the formalities are completed Hewitt will become the permanent successor to Greg Clarke, who resigned after making racially offensive remarks in front of a parliamentary committee. Hewitt has an extensive background in business that suggests a more polished approach to high-profile positions representing her employer. She is a former chief executive of RAC and the current nonexecutive chair at Visa Europe, the clothing brand White Stuff and the financial services group BGL, which owns price comparison site Compare The Market. Hewitt has also spent six years on the board of The Restaurant Group plc, which owns Wagamama and Frankie and Benny’s. She will step down from that role on taking up her FA position. “I’ve been passionate about football from a very young age and I’m excited by the opportunity to play my part in shaping the future of something that means so much to so many,” said Hewitt, who was awarded an MBE in 2011 for services to business and the public sector. Here’s the full story: The US trade deficit has narrowed slightly from its record high. The trade deficit dropped 8.2% to $68.9bn in April, the Commerce Department reports, thanks to a 1.1% rise in exports and a 1.4% drop in imports. April exports totalled $205bn, $2.3bn more than March exports, while April imports were $273.9bn, down $3.8bn. But March’s data has been revised up, to show a record trade gap of $75bn (up from the $74.4bn first reported). The US trade balance could improve further, as other major economies emerge from the pandemic and import more American-made goods. Small US firms are also planning to raise prices, in response to surging costs, the NFIB adds: In the US, small-business confidence has edged lower last month as inflation worries and hiring problems worry bosses. The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) Optimism Index has dipped by 0.2 points to a reading of 99.6 in May, ending a three-month run of increases. NFIB chief economist Bill Dunkelberg said in a statement that labor shortages and rising prices were worrying small business owners. “If small business owners could hire more workers to take care of customers, sales would be higher and getting closer to pre-COVID levels” “In addition, inflation on Main Street is rampant and small business owners are uncertain about future business conditions.” A net 27% of businesses said they planned to create new jobs in the next three months, up 6 points from April and a record high. More companies warned that jobs were hard to fill (vacancies have been running at record levels, with a new JOLTS report due later today). Economist Aaron Sojourner says the solution to the hiring problems is clear -- raise wages. The property website OnTheMarket has reported its first annual profit since being launched by a group of estate agents six years ago. It comes as the UK housing market enjoyed a boom fuelled by working from home relocations and the stamp duty holiday, with prices up around 10% over the last year. The firm, which is 60% owned by agents, made a pretax profit of £1.1m in the year to 31 January compared with a loss of £11.7m the year before. Its revenues rose by 22% to £23m, helped by higher revenues from new home developments listed on the website. It advertises both lettings and sales, and counts 10 big housebuilders among its clients, including Crest Nicholson and Barratt, as well as thousands of estate agents. While we were away...my colleague Rob Davies wrote about BAT’s surge in sales of alternatives to cigarettes: British American Tobacco recruited 1.4 million new users of vapes, heated tobacco and nicotine pouches in the first quarter, as it seeks to make cigarette alternatives profitable by 2025. Shares in the London-headquartered tobacco company gained more than 2% in early stock market trading, after it reported a strong performance in both cigarettes and “non-combustible” products such as Vype, its flagship vapour brand. BAT has set a target of 50 million users of non-cigarette products by 2025, as it aims to burnish its credentials as a modern tobacco company promoting so-called “reduced risk” choices for nicotine users. The company said growth in cigarette alternatives had accelerated. But sales will have to continue picking up pace if BAT is to achieve its goal, after the 1.4 million increase took it to 14.9 million, less than a third of the target. Britain’s cabinet office is urgently investigating the internet outage which affected the government’s website today, Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s spokesman said on Tuesday (Reuters reports). The spokesman said: “It appears to be a wider issue, a global issue, affecting a number of non-government sites, and as you would expect Cabinet Office are investigating it as a matter of urgency,” Fortunately, Gov.uk site seem to be back online now. Fastly, the content delivery firm at the heart of the global web outages, has tweeted that it’s disabled the ‘service configuration’ responsible for this huge disruption. Its global network is now ‘coming back online’, Fastly adds. In the meantime, the UK’s Attorney General advised emailing the department if you can’t get through on Gov.uk (It seems to be working now...) A massive internet outage, affecting websites including the Guardian, the UK government’s website Gov.uk, Amazon, and Reddit has been traced to a failure in a content delivery network (CDN) run by Fastly. The outage, which began around 11am UK time, saw visitors to a vast array of sites receive error messages including, “Error 503 service unavailable” and a terse “connection failure”. As well as bringing down some websites entirely, the failure also broke specific sections of other services, such as the servers for Twitter that host the social network’s emojis. Fastly, a cloud computing services provider, was believed to be the cause of the problem. The company runs an “edge cloud”, which is designed to speed up loading times for websites, protect them from denial-of-service attacks, and help them deal with bursts of traffic. A massive internet outage has hit social media, government and news websites today -- including The Guardian (but if you’re reading this, we’re back...) Major sites including Amazon, Reddit and Twitch were affected, along with parts of the BBC and a host of other media outlets including the New York Times, CNN and Bloomberg News The UK government website - gov.uk - has also been hit. The outage is being linked to a problem at US cloud service company Fastly, whose content delivery network is widely used to help websites run faster and provide security. Our technology editor Alex Hern has been tweeting what we know: Reuters’ has details too: Fastly said it was investigating “the potential impact to performance with our CDN services,” according to its website. Most of Fastly’s coverage areas were facing “Degraded Performance”, the website showed. Separately, Amazon.com Inc’s retail website also seemed to be down. Amazon was not immediately available to comment. Nearly 21,000 Reddit users reported issues with the social media platform, while more than 2,000 users reported problems with Amazon, according to outage monitoring website Downdetector.com. The eurozone’s recession was much shallower than feared. Statistics body Eurostat has revised up its estimate of GDP in the first quarter of 2021; now estimating the eurozone economy only shrank by 0.3% in January-March, not the 0.6% contraction first reported. It’s a welcome boost to Europe’s economy as it tried to pull away from the pandemic. Ireland (+7.8%) and Croatia (+5.8%) recorded the sharpest increases of GDP compared to the previous quarter, followed by Estonia (+4.8%) and Greece (+4.4%). The strongest declines were observed in Portugal (-3.3%) and Slovakia (-2.0%), followed by Germany (-1.8%) and Latvia (-1.7%) Sophie Griffiths, market analyst at OANDA, says it’s a significant upward revision: After a better-than-expected first quarter, combined with easing pandemic restrictions, improving vaccine numbers, and an upbeat outlook for the coming months, there is a good chance that European bourses could continue pressing higher to fresh record levels. UK banks will for the first time be forced to reveal their exposure to the climate crisis, highlighting the risks that rising temperatures and sea levels could pose for the financial system, as part of the Bank of England’s climate stress tests this year. The stress tests will put 19 banks and insurers through three climate scenarios, according to an update released Tuesday, including one where governments fail to take further steps to curb greenhouse gas emissions, resulting in average temperature increases of 3.3C and a 3.9m rise in sea levels. The central bank will be monitoring how those scenarios could impact potential loan losses, as customers default due to slowing growth and economic uncertainty. However, the Bank of England will not identify individual businesses through the tests and will release only aggregate results for the banking and insurance sector, which will be published in May 2022. The tests will look ahead 30 years. But the central bank also confirmed that the information will not be used to set capital requirements, which determine the kind of financial cushion that banks need in order to protect them from risky loans and products on their balance sheets. Instead, the exercise is meant to improve the way banks and insurers manage risks, and prompt a strategic review of their operations in light of the climate threat. Here’s the full story: Positive Money senior economist David Barmes is disappointed the BoE isn’t going further, though: “It is concerning that the Bank of England appears to be ruling out using climate stress tests to help inform changes to capital requirements. Climate capital rules that reflect the high risk of fossil fuel investments are a necessary inevitability to ensure financial stability and alignment with the government’s climate plans, and the Bank needs to be introducing such policies without delay. “By delaying the implementation of climate capital rules, the Bank is undermining its duty to protect financial stability and support net-zero.” Investor sentiment in Germany has fallen, but hopes of a strong economic recovery this year are still on track. That’s according to the ZEW Economic Research institute. Its poll of investors’ economic sentiment has fallen to 79.8 points this month, from 84.4 in the previous month, and lower than expected But.. the survey also shows that the economy is improving; ZEW’s gauge of current conditions jumped sharply to -9.1 points from -40.1 the previous month. ZEW President Achim Wambach said in a statement. “The economic recovery is progressing,” “The decline in expectations is probably largely due to the considerably better assessment of the economic situation, which is now back at pre-crisis levels.” The City of London’s last “open outcry” trading floor is to reopen, after opposition to plans to move to all-electronic trading. The London Metal Exchange has announced that, following a consultation, the Ring will reopen for physical trading on 6th September. The move means that metal traders can look forward to returning to their red leather benches, and setting the world’s daily benchmark prices for industrial metals such as copper, aluminium and zinc by shouting buy and sell orders at each other. The Ring has been temporarily closed since the first wave of the pandemic. And back in January, the LME proposed going digital - closing one of the last remaining in-person trading sites at major financial centres. That provoked a backlash from some brokers, who insisted that physical trading was the best way to organize price discovery (while sticking to a strict dress code, keeping one’s hair presentable, not chewing gum, and never leaving one’s seat!) LME users were split on the issue, with smaller traders favouring prices being discovered in the Ring, and larger ones pushing for electronic trading. So in a delicate compromise, this outcry trading will only set lunchtime Official Prices. Closing prices will be decided electronically (as they have been since March 2020). Matthew Chamberlain, LME CEO, explains: The divergent views in response to the Discussion Paper were particularly apparent between traditional participants and some smaller physical clients on the one hand, and our larger merchant trader and financial participants on the other. However, respondents were constructive in proposing approaches to reconcile these differences, respecting the differing needs of the LME community, and preserving the unique and mutually beneficial blend of physical and financial market liquidity, which makes our market so special. Global stock markets hit a fresh record high overnight too, with the MSCI All-Country World Index touching a new peak. Investors are waiting for key events and data releases this week, such as inflation data from China (Wednesday), the next US inflation report (Thursday), and the European Central Bank’s monetary policy meeting (Thursday). They’ll all be examined for signs that the recovery is on track, and hints of when central bankers might start to tighten their stimulus packages. Ray Attrill, head of FX Strategy at National Australia Bank, says: The start of a new week has not seen much by way of price action across all asset classes. “It’s hard to avoid the sense the global markets are for the most part now simply lurching from one big event risk to the next with not a lot to see in-between. It’s another quiet day in Europe’s stock markets, as investors take a breather after some lively sessions this year. The pan-European Stoxx 600 snuck up to a new record high this morning, up 0.2% to 454.52, suggesting confidence in the recovery remains strong. However, Germany’s DAX is slightly lower, following this morning’s surprise drop in industrial output. Manufacturers such as HeidelbergCement (-2.6%), materials group Covestra (-1.3%), and carmakers Volkswagen (-1.5%) and Daimler (-1.2%) as leading the fallers. On April’s factory slowdown, Teeuwe Mevissen, senior market economist at Rabobank, says: “I think it says more about the supply constraints. The big question is how long will these remain,” “Markets are in a wait-and-see mode. Valuations are high, and they need new catalysts to justify further buying.” Back on Germany....Capital Economics’ Andrew Kenningham says its factory slowdown means the economy was under par in April. But he’s still hopeful that Germany return to growth in the current quarter, having shrunk in January-March. He writes: The decline in German industrial production in April underlines that the German economy was performing well below normal at the start of the second quarter. But things should have improved since then, so we still expect GDP to rebound after its sharp decline in Q1. British American Tobacco (+1.6%) are also in the risers, after raising revenue forecasts on the back of higher demand for ‘non-tobacco’ products (such as vaping kits and nicotine pouches). BAT now expects revenue growth guidance of above 5% for 2021, as it pushes these ‘new category’ products such as Vuse, Velo and Glo. Jack Bowles, chief executive, said BAT had a “record quarter for consumer acquisition”. “We added +1.4 million non-combustible product consumers in Q1, to reach a total of 14.9 million. “We are growing New Categories at pace, encouraging more smokers to switch to scientifically substantiated reduced-risk alternatives.” Back in February, my colleagues Rob Davies and Matthew Chapman reported how BAT had launched a £1bn campaign using social media and popular influencers to promote its e-cigarettes, vapes and pouches. They explained: Critics say that such viral videos, even if they aren’t paid-for adverts, are the consequence of a global marketing push designed to offset dwindling cigarette consumption by recruiting the nicotine consumers of the future. BAT has embarked on a £1bn campaign that harnesses the popular appeal of social media influencers, pop stars and sporting events. According to a wide-ranging report by The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, it has also attracted younger adults, non-smokers and even reached the eyes of children. Shares in UK insurance firm Aviva have jumped 3.6%, after activist investor Cevian took a 5% stake - and started pressing for change. Cevian, Europe’s biggest activist investor, is pushing for Aviva to make deeper cost cuts, and return £5bn to investors following recent asset sales. Christer Gardell, Cevian’s co-founder, says: “Aviva has been poorly managed for many years, and its high-quality core businesses have been held back by high costs and a series of bad strategic decisions.” Shares in Aviva have gained 14.7p to 425p this morning, their highest since January 2020, just before the pandemic. Aviva has been selling off international assets since CEO Amanda Blanc took the helm last summer, and pledged to focus on larger businesses in the UK, Ireland and Canada. But Cevian argues that Aviva’s share price could climb to more than £8 within three years, if it returned excess capital to shareholders through dividends or buybacks. The FT has more details... Aviva has promised substantial returns and cost reductions as central planks of its strategy shift under Blanc, who has told investors that her mantra is to move quickly. However, Cevian wants a specific return of £5bn in dividends or buybacks of capital that the insurer has in excess of regulatory requirements The activist fund also believes that the cost-cutting can go further, calling for reductions of more than £500m from Aviva’s annual cost base by 2023, compared with the management’s target of £300m. It is also pushing for a leaner management structure, according to a person familiar with the matter. In London, stocks have opened a little higher, with the FTSE 100 up 15 points or 0.2% to 7092 points. Asset manager Intermediate Capital Group are the top riser, surging 6.7%, after reporting record profits, and a 19% jump in third-party assets under management amid the recovery in markets over the last year. But oil producer Royal Dutch Shell are down 1.3%, following a drop in the oil price this morning, while steelmaker Evraz is down 1.5%. Brent crude has dipped 0.5% to $71 per barrel, after China’s crude oil imports dropped by almost 15% in May - suggesting weaker demand. Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizhuo Securities, said: “Chinese oil imports at a five-month low ... would tend to confirm weakness in the Asia market.” On a brighter note, Japan’s economy shrank by less than first feared in the January-March quarter. Q1 GDP was revised up today, to show an annualised contraction of 3.9% (so almost 1% smaller on a quarterly basis). That’s up from a preliminary reading of a 5.1% contraction (or -1.3% q/q). Government spending and corporate investment fell less than first estimated, although household spending fell slightly more. Although the upgrade is welcome, it still leaves Japan half-way into recession, and breaks its recovery in the second half of 2020. A lack of semiconductors, timber and other intermediate goods weighed on German industrial output, says Reuters: The weaker than expected industrial figures suggest that the German economy will have to rely on household spending to support a still-fragile recovery from the coronavirus crisis. “Such a combination is unparalleled: Order books in industry are well filled and production is falling,” VP Bank economist Thomas Gitzel said, adding that the supply problems with semiconductors were pushing down output in the car industry. So despite well-filled order books, manufacturing will only make a limited contribution to overall economic growth in the second quarter, Gitzel said. The week-long blockage of the Suez Canal by the Ever Given in March contributed to the supply chain problems hitting German firms in April, suggests Carsten Brzeski of ING. He writes that April’s disappointing drop in industrial production suggests the rebound of the German economy in Q2 has ‘started with shaky knees’: The disappointing start to the second quarter suggests that supply chain disruptions, like the blockage of the Suez Canal in April or the ongoing semiconductor delivery problems, have not left German industry unscathed. However despite today’s disappointment, the industrial outlook remains bright. Brzeski adds that capacity issues and the lack of qualified workers could soon return as the most pressing hurdles to growth, as lack of demand isn’t a problem. Destatis also reports that German construction output fell by 4.3% in April -- suggesting that shortages of building materials might be weighing on the sector. Energy production jumped by 6.0%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Output at German factories has fallen unexpectedly, as supply chain bottlenecks and shortages of key parts and materials such as computer chips threaten to undermine the recovery. German industrial production fell by 1.0% in April, the Federal Statistics Office reports this morning. That’s shy of forecasts of a 0.5% rise, as Europe’s largest economy looked to recover from its contraction earlier this year. Production of consumer goods slumped by 3.3% - even though some households are expected to be spending heavily this summer as lockdowns restriction are lifted. Production of intermediate goods (items used in final products) fell 0.2%, while production of heavy duty capital goods decreased by 0.1%. March’s growth was revised down too, from +2.5% to +2.2%. It means production at German factories is still 5.6% below its pre-pandemic levels, despite the pick-up in the global economy this year. Factory bosses have been warning of shortages of semiconductors, plastics, rubber and metals, with suppliers hiking prices in response. These shortfalls are threatening to undermine the recovery from last year’s economic slump, and are also pushing prices higher as firms try to recoup their costs. Yesterday we learned that German factory orders fell in April, indicating that the problems may last for some time. Semiconductor shortages are a particular problem, which has already hit car production this year. Those shortages are expected to run into next year, as ramping up chip fabrication plants takes time. Tesla is reportedly considering buying its own chip plant, to guarantee supplies. Bosch, Europe’s largest auto supplier, says car manufacturers must put “money on the table” and make a “rock solid” commitment to orders, Bosch board member Harald Krüger told the Financial Times. “The only way to get out of [the recent crisis] is to have a different level of commitment” Bosch opened a €1bn semiconductor plant in Dresden yesterday, to produce chips for its power tools in July, before beginning production on automotive chips in September. That might help to ease the chip shortage, though as Krüger says.... “Money needs to be put on the table and actually parts have to be bought. “The commitment needs to be rock solid that those parts will be bought. It can’t be: ‘Maybe I [will] buy them, prepare for it, and maybe not.’ This doesn’t work.” More here: Carmakers must ‘put money on table’ to avoid repeat of chip crisis The agenda 8.30am BST: Bank of England to publish details of its 2021 climate change stress test 10am BST: ZEW index of German economic sentiment 10am BST: Eurozone Q1 GDP and employment figures (final estimate) 11am BST: US NFIB business optimism index 1.30pm BST: US trade balance for April 3pm BST: US JOLTS index of job openings","charCount":"30345","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/graemewearden\">Graeme Wearden</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/live/2021/jun/08/joe-manchin-voting-legislation-black-civil-rights-leaders-joe-biden-us-politics-latest-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-08T15:22:21Z","webTitle":"Joe Manchin to face critics in meeting with Black civil rights leaders on voting – live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2021/jun/08/joe-manchin-voting-legislation-black-civil-rights-leaders-joe-biden-us-politics-latest-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/live/2021/jun/08/joe-manchin-voting-legislation-black-civil-rights-leaders-joe-biden-us-politics-latest-updates","fields":{"headline":"Joe Manchin to face critics in meeting with Black civil rights leaders on voting – live","standfirst":"<ul><li>Democratic senator said in op-ed he won’t vote for voting rights legislation</li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jun/08/joe-manchin-voting-rights-senated-democrats-republicans\">Manchin’s hard no on voting bill leaves Democrats seeking new path</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2018/sep/17/guardian-us-morning-briefing-sign-up-to-stay-informed\">Sign up to receive First Thing – our daily briefing by email</a></li></ul>","trailText":"Democratic senator had written op-ed on why he won’t vote for voting rights legislation for which he was a key vote","byline":"Vivian Ho","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2a930b27439ffa540b008928e4effdffb6af806b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a930b27439ffa540b008928e4effdffb6af806b/0_263_7873_4727/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Manchin in Washington DC. \" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Manchin in Washington DC. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<div id=\"block-60bf85f38f0827600c04c922\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-08T15:22:21.894Z\">4.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Senate report on US Capitol attack finds broad failings</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The first – and possibly the last – bipartisan review<strong> </strong>into the<strong> 6 January attack</strong> on the <strong>US Capitol</strong> uncovered failings on all fronts before the attack as well as breakdowns between intelligence agencies and a lack of preparation by the <strong>Capitol police</strong>. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/viaCristiano/status/1402280284951920644\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Senate Homeland report on Jan. 6 out today details how calls for violence on social media weren&#39;t deemed credible by intel agencies ahead of the deadly riot <a href=\"https://t.co/GSmgYGOlvY\">https://t.co/GSmgYGOlvY</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/8xIfNEVpim\">pic.twitter.com/8xIfNEVpim</a></p>&mdash;

Emma Walmsley, chief executive of the drugmaker GSK, is being currently targeted by the New York hedge fund Elliott Management, run by the billionaire Paul Singer, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/apr/15/glaxosmithkline-shares-jump-at-news-of-activist-hedge-fund-interest\">took a sizeable stake in GSK to push for change in April</a>. Elliott is reported to have initially questioned whether Walmsley should lead the pharmaceutical company, before changing tack to demand an acceleration in her plans to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/apr/28/gsks-emma-walmsley-vows-to-lead-drugs-firm-through-corporate-split\">spin off the GSK’s consumer healthcare division</a> next year. She will outline a 10-year strategy for the business at an investor day on 23 June.</p> <p>Since Blanc took the helm at Aviva last July, the insurer has sold eight businesses in France, Italy, Asia and elsewhere to focus on its key markets of the UK, Ireland and Canada. The sales will raise £7.5bn, and it said last month it planned to return money to shareholders, without specifying how much. Analysts estimate that the insurer will have £3.7bn to £6.6bn of excess capital following the completion of the disposals.</p> <p>Cevian, the largest activist fund in Europe, is also pushing for more cost cuts, saying reductions of at least £500m could be achieved by 2023. Aviva has already said it will reduce costs by £300m by 2022.</p> <p>Christer Gardell, one of two managing partners who founded Cevian in 1996 with Lars Förberg, said: “Aviva has been poorly managed for many years, and its high-quality core businesses have been held back by high costs and a series of bad strategic decisions.” </p> <p>Cevian has expressed confidence in Aviva’s senior bosses and the company’s potential. Gardell said: “We believe chairman George Culmer and CEO Amanda Blanc are committed to crystallising this potential and delivering substantial shareholder value.”</p> <p>He said a “focused and high-performing Aviva should be able to have a value in excess of £8 per share within three years, and more than double the dividend to 45p”. The Aviva share price rose 3% to 422.80p on Tuesday.</p> <p>An Aviva spokesperson said: “Aviva has made significant strategic progress over the past 11 months and we remain sharply focused on further improving our performance.

Cevian Capital, a Swedish investment firm with $16bn under management, said Aviva, Britain’s biggest general insurer, should return £5bn of excess capital next year after it completes the sale of a collection of non-core divisions. Blanc is one of only seven female chief executives leading a FTSE 100 company. Emma Walmsley, chief executive of the drugmaker GSK, is being currently targeted by the New York hedge fund Elliott Management, run by the billionaire Paul Singer, which took a sizeable stake in GSK to push for change in April. Elliott is reported to have initially questioned whether Walmsley should lead the pharmaceutical company, before changing tack to demand an acceleration in her plans to spin off the GSK’s consumer healthcare division next year. She will outline a 10-year strategy for the business at an investor day on 23 June. Since Blanc took the helm at Aviva last July, the insurer has sold eight businesses in France, Italy, Asia and elsewhere to focus on its key markets of the UK, Ireland and Canada. The sales will raise £7.5bn, and it said last month it planned to return money to shareholders, without specifying how much. Analysts estimate that the insurer will have £3.7bn to £6.6bn of excess capital following the completion of the disposals. Cevian, the largest activist fund in Europe, is also pushing for more cost cuts, saying reductions of at least £500m could be achieved by 2023. Aviva has already said it will reduce costs by £300m by 2022. Christer Gardell, one of two managing partners who founded Cevian in 1996 with Lars Förberg, said: “Aviva has been poorly managed for many years, and its high-quality core businesses have been held back by high costs and a series of bad strategic decisions.” Cevian has expressed confidence in Aviva’s senior bosses and the company’s potential. Gardell said: “We believe chairman George Culmer and CEO Amanda Blanc are committed to crystallising this potential and delivering substantial shareholder value.” He said a “focused and high-performing Aviva should be able to have a value in excess of £8 per share within three years, and more than double the dividend to 45p”. The Aviva share price rose 3% to 422.80p on Tuesday. An Aviva spokesperson said: “Aviva has made significant strategic progress over the past 11 months and we remain sharply focused on further improving our performance. We regularly engage with investors and welcome any thoughts which move us towards our goal of delivering long term shareholder value.” Russ Mould, investment director at the stockbroker AJ Bell, said: “The poor long-term performance record of Aviva’s shares is hardly Amanda Blanc’s fault and she is already working to fix it … This may explain why Cevian does not seem to be agitating for a change of leadership or a board seat and appears to be taking a more ‘suggestivist’ stance, since in many ways it and Aviva seem to be in agreement over what to be done.

That rather depends on your definition. No country will vaccinate every adult. Vaccinating enough to achieve herd immunity, which could be 60% or 70%, is the real aim.

It was designed as their lifeline. Covax signed contracts with manufacturers to buy 2bn doses by the end of this year. But it is stymied. Its main supplier is the Serum Institute of India, which is now churning out vaccines in response to the terrible surge in domestic cases and deaths and will not be able to fulfil its contracts to Covax or individual countries before the end of the year.</p> <p>Dr Bruce Aylward, senior adviser to the director general of the World Health Organization, who is heavily involved in the vaccine efforts, said: “This is where the UK becomes really important and the G7, because right now we’ve got this gap of death.

That brings the UK total deaths to 127,854. Separate figures published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show there have been 153,000 deaths registered in the UK where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate. The number of people who have received the first dose of a vaccine rose to 40,573,517, a rise of 112,941 on the previous day. 28,227,362 were recorded as second doses, an increase of 306,068. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) will give a verdict on the use of Moderna Covid-19 vaccine in 12- to 17-year-olds next month, following an application by the drugmaker. The committee said it would “speed up” assessment of data submitted adding that a delay would happen if the EMA required any additional information. It’s worth bearing in mind the two-dose vaccine is already being used in the EU, the US, and Canada for people over 18 years of age. The company has also sought approval in Canada for use in adolescents and plans for a US application. If approved, the Moderna vaccine would become the second shot to be allowed for use in teenagers in the EU after Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine was approved last month. In England, measures to try to halt the rise of the Delta variant of will cover 10% of England’s population. Health secretary Matt Hancock has announced a “strengthened package of support” to be provided for Greater Manchester and Lancashire, where case numbers remain high. Other areas, such as Bolton, will continue to receive support. Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham stressed this was “not a lockdown” but “advice”. At a press conference he said: “Obviously what we’re seeing here is a localised approach to messaging, more localised support on testing and on tracing and isolation. We are also saying that also should apply to vaccination. “We are not asking for any more vaccine here than our fair share, what we are asking for is the bringing forward of Greater Manchester’s supplies, so that we can run a surge vaccination programme over the next three weeks.” On Monday, Hancock told the House of Commons that out of 12,383 cases of the Delta variant, 464 people went on to seek emergency care and 126 were admitted to hospital. Of these, 83 people were unvaccinated, 28 had one dose of vaccine and just three had had both doses. Pfizer will begin testing its Covid-19 vaccine on a larger cohort of children under 12 years old after selecting a lower dose of the shot in an earlier stage of the trial. The study will enrol up to 4,500 children at more than 90 clinical sites in the US, Finland, Poland, and Spain, the company said. Based on safety, tolerability and the immune response generated by 144 children in a phase I study of the two-dose shot, Pfizer said it will test a dose of 10 micrograms in children between five and 11 years of age. They will also test 3 micrograms for the age group of six months to five years old. The vaccine has been authorised for use in children as young as 12 in Europe, the US and Canada. They receive the same dose as adults: 30 micrograms. Inoculating children and young people is considered a critical step toward reaching “herd immunity” and taming the Covid-19 pandemic. Nearly 7 million teens have received at least one dose of the vaccine in the US, according to the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. The husband and wife team who helped make the first Covid-19 vaccine are contributing to a book about their efforts. BioNTech founders Ugur Sahin and Özlem Türeci, from Germany, are collaborating with Joe Miller of the Financial Times on The Vaccine. Publication of the book is scheduled for 2 November. According to the publishing group St Martin’s, the book will detail how the pair were able to develop a panel of vaccine candidates within a matter of weeks, how they convinced major pharmaceutical companies to support their work, and how in partnership with Pfizer they managed to produce more than 2bn doses for countries around the world. Meanwhile, the Pfizer chairman and CEO, Albert Bourla, is also working on a book, announced last month. Harper Business is publishing Bourla’s Moonshot: Inside Pfizer’s Nine-Month Race to Make the Impossible Possible on 9 November. You can read more about Ugur Sahin and Özlem Türeci here: A dope idea? Washington state is to give adults a free cannabis spliff after they receive a Covid jab in an attempt to accelerate vaccination uptake. The promotion, coined “Joints for Jabs” by the state’s liquor and cannabis board, was announced yesterday and will run until 12 July. Participating cannabis retailers will give the pre-rolled spliffs to those who have received their first or second dose, if they wish to get high. According to the New York Times, 58% of people in Washington have received at least one dose and 49% are fully vaccinated. The state also recently instituted plans to allow a free beer, wine or cocktail to residents with proof of vaccination, the Washington Post reports. Elsewhere in the US, the paper reports that after the pace of vaccinations began to seriously decline in April, states and cities began promotions including a raffle for full college scholarships and lotteries including prizes of $1m of more – with only those who had been vaccinated eligible. Plans to allow an NHS system to extract patient data from doctors’ surgeries in England have been delayed amid concerns around privacy. But Jo Churchill, the public health minister, said the data programme would still go ahead this year. The World Bank has raised its global growth forecast to 5.6% for 2021, marking the strongest recovery from a recession in 80 years due to US stimulus spending and faster growth in China but held back by “highly unequal” access to Covid-19 vaccines. Reuters has the story: The development lender’s latest Global Economic Prospects report showed a 1.5% point increase from forecasts made in January, before the Biden administration took office and enacted a $1.9 trillion US Covid-19 aid package. Since then, vaccines have become much more widely distributed in the US and some other wealthy countries, boosting their output, as forecasts lag for emerging market and low-income countries. “This recovery is uneven and largely reflects sharp rebounds in some major economies - most notably the US, owing to substantial fiscal support - amid highly unequal vaccine access,” the World Bank said in the report. Many emerging market and developing economies were seeing elevated Covid-19 caseloads, obstacles to vaccination and withdrawal of support, the bank said. By 2022, this will leave global output about 2% below pre-pandemic projections, and about two thirds of emerging market economies will still not have made up last year’s per-capita income losses. If vaccine distribution to developing countries can be accelerated, World Bank economist Ayhan Kose said that 2022 global GDP growth, currently forecast at 4.3%, could increase substantially to around 5%. A small addendum on the final paragraph: one wonders to what extent the profits from an acceleration of vaccine distribution to developing countries would further entrench the north-south global divide. Many thousands of vaccine doses have been destroyed in African countries after exceeding their expiry dates amid a reluctance to be inoculated and a lack of medical infrastructure, the BBC reports. Malawi has destroyed almost 20,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, while South Sudan said it would safely dispose of 59,000 doses and hand back another 72,000 to the global Covax scheme for poorer countries. The Democratic Republic of Congo said it could not use most of the 1.7 million AstraZeneca doses it received through Covax, so they were sent to Ghana, Madagascar and elsewhere. Nigeria was also unable to use some doses. Some vaccines are given with a short shelf life before expiry, such as a batch of one million doses South Africa received from India in February with an expiry date of 13 April. However, the the country’s government opted not to use them due to concerns the jabs did not offer sufficient protection from the prevalent Covid variant. Malawi virologist Gama Bandawe told the BBC that mistrust of vaccines has played a role in the country being unable to use all the supplies it has received. A study commissioned by the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention on Covid-19 vaccine perceptions in 15 countries suggests that a significant proportion of people on the continent harbour concerns around vaccine safety. Unions representing teachers and other school staff are calling on the government to reinstate masks in classrooms in England in response to a growing number of Covid outbreaks, particularly among secondary pupils. Authorities in 92 countries shut down 113,000 websites and online marketplaces selling counterfeit or illicit medicines and medical products last month, including vast quantities of fake Covid-19 tests and face masks, Interpol has said. “As the pandemic forced more people to move their lives online, criminals were quick to target these new ‘customers’,” Jurgen Stock, secretary general of the international police agency, said in a statement. AFP reports that unauthorised Covid testing kits accounted for over half of all the medical devices seized from 18-25 May, the agency said, while Italian authorities found more than 500,000 fake surgical masks and 35 machines for their production and packaging. Police arrested 227 people worldwide and recovered pharmaceutical products worth $23m. “Whilst some individuals were knowingly buying illicit medicines, many thousands of victims were unwittingly putting their health and potentially their lives at risk,” Stock said. Fake and illicit drugs were also found concealed in shipments of clothes, jewellery, toys and food. The roughly 9m devices and drugs seized was the highest number since Interpol began coordinating the fake medicine campaigns, known as Pangea operations, in 2008. Researchers in Denmark are using virtual reality to encourage more Covid-19 vaccinations, through a game of manoeuvring through a virus-infected crowd in a city square. In an experiment by the University of Copenhagen, participants wear goggles to play an elderly person crossing the square while avoiding red-clothed by-passers infected with Covid-19. Vaccinated characters dress in blue. “It was fun, definitely. It felt like you were there,” said Adam, a participant who got infected in the game he played in a Copenhagen park. “We know from similar studies that after people went through a virtual reality experience like this, their vaccination intention increases. We have observed this with Covid already,” said Robert Bohm, professor of psychology at the University of Copenhagen, citing a prior online study by the researchers. The World Health Organization estimates that immunisation prevents 4 million to 5 million deaths every year. In February-March, more than a quarter of European Union adults said they would refuse a Covid-19 shot, a survey by the EU agency Eurofound showed. Music fans flocked to the first unrestricted European festival since the pandemic began over the weekend at an event in Albania that had 10,000 attendees across four days. The open-air Unum music festival saw performances by 50 international and local musicians, as people embraced the chance to hear nonstop music for five days at Thrown Sand beach, 75km north-west of the capital, Tirana. AP reports that organisers claimed that everyone at the festival was free of Covid-19. “Once everyone is tested, It’ll be safer among thousands of people inside the festival than it will be outside in the general population,” Grego O’Halloran, the head organiser, told Mixmag ahead of the event. “We went to the Albanian government and said that we have a way of testing people and they were like ‘Alright great, well that sounds good!’ “There will be testing stations all around the city that you can pop in to, or if you’ve got a negative PCR test arriving into Albania that will cover you for a certain period. There’ll be a double check mid-festival to make sure everything is as secure as possible.” The main stage near the beach was on top of a sailboat, while another was under the pine trees close to the beach. Festivalgoers came from all across Europe, even as far away as Uruguay. “[It’s] awesome … crazy … insane to see so many people in one place … [after] sitting in one room in your apartment alone in lockdown,” said one German attendee. The event was possible because of Albania’s low contagion rate. It recorded only two new infections on Saturday. The foreign ministry noted there were no pandemic restrictions for anyone wanting to come to Albania. The motto of the festival was for people to become “one” and unite over music, and some said music was more important than most people realised. “It was necessary for our mental health,” said Ron Kurtolli, a DJ from Kosovo. “People don’t pay much attention to mental health, but it’s really important for the well-being of everything.” Thousands of US families with children in foster care have seen reunifications snarled as courts delayed cases, went virtual or temporarily shut down, according to an Associated Press analysis of child welfare data from 34 states. The decrease in children leaving foster care means families are lingering longer in a system intended to be temporary, as critical services were shuttered or limited. Vulnerable families are suffering long-term and perhaps irreversible damage, experts say, which could leave parents with weakened bonds with their children. The AP’s analysis found at least 8,700 fewer reunifications during the early months of the pandemic compared with the March-to-December period the year before – a decrease of 16%. Adoptions dropped too — by 23%. Overall, at least 22,600 fewer children left foster care compared with 2019. “The systemic problems around racism and poverty in Covid and how people are treated in the child welfare system may be compounding,” said Sharon Vandivere of the group Child Trends, who noted that longer stays in foster care are inherently traumatic and make reunifications less likely. Many more men in India have received Covid-19 vaccines than women, government data shows, highlighting gender disparity in the country’s immunisation drive that has also disadvantaged the rural population. Reuters reports that India has partly or fully vaccinated about 101 million men, nearly 17% more than women. Men account for 54% of the total number of people inoculated, according to the data. Many federally administered regions, the capital Delhi, and big states such as Uttar Pradesh have seen some of the worst inequities. Only Kerala in the south and Chhattisgarh in central India have vaccinated more women than men. “We are noticing that men, especially in towns and villages, prefer to take the vaccine before women as they have to travel for work, while women are relegated to domestic chores,” said Prashant Pandya, medical superintendent at a big government hospital in the western state of Gujarat. India, with a population of 1.3 billion, has about 6% more men than women. Fifteen of the UK’s Nobel prize-winning scientists, economists and peace activists have called on the country to “play a historic role” in removing “artificial” intellectual property barriers that are “restricting” Covid-19 vaccine production. In a letter to the UK prime minister, the Nobel laureates caution that “last year, science was the main barrier to beating this disease; but today, it is inequality”, with highly effective vaccines largely available only to wealthy countries. An intellectual property waiver is “an essential step to increase production”, the letter said, calling for pharmaceutical giants to be forced to share their vaccine technology and know-how through the World Health Organisation’s Covid-19 Technology Access Pool. India and South Africa first proposed a Covid vaccine waiver at the World Trade Organisation eight months ago, with the support of more than 100 mostly low and middle-income countries, but the move was blocked by a small number of rich countries including the US, Japan, the UK, and EU. Sir Richard Roberts, awarded the 1993 Nobel Prize in medicine, said: The scientific case for this is clear. If we allow Covid-19 to spread around the globe for years, not only will millions needlessly die, but the virus will continue to mutate into more virulent strains. That could undo all of our work – including the work of British scientists – in developing effective vaccines and will likely prolong the pandemic for years. We don’t have time for politicking. The intellectual property barriers to vaccine production are hindering local production of vaccines, especially in low and middle income countries, and they must be cleared away. Sir Christopher Pissarides, awarded the 2010 Nobel prize in economic sciences, said: British scientists have created life-saving vaccines that can help save the lives of millions. But it would be a tragedy if in these exceptional times they are locked away and kept secret, shared among only a handful of pharmaceutical companies. Mairead Corrigan-Maguire, awarded the 1976 Nobel peace prize, said: With high vaccination rates in rich countries while low and middle-income nations suffer, we are watching a system of vaccine apartheid develop. There is no justification for the needless loss of life in the months since India and South Africa first requested an intellectual property waiver. These are global public goods, developed largely with public funding; they belong to all of us. Boris Johnson must do what is right and support this waiver, for all of humanity. A host of celebrities including David Beckham, Olivia Colman and Billie Eilish have written to world leaders calling for surplus coronavirus vaccines to be shared with poorer countries. In an open letter, published ahead of the G7 summit on Friday, the Unicef ambassadors said the meeting was a “vital opportunity” for action to be taken. The world has spent a year and a half battling the Covid-19 pandemic, but the virus is still spreading in many countries and producing new variants with the potential to put us all back where we started. This means more school closures, more healthcare disruptions and greater economic fallout - threatening the futures of families and children everywhere. The pandemic will not be over anywhere until it is over everywhere, and that means getting vaccines to every country, as quickly and equitably as possible. This weekend’s G7 summit is a vital opportunity for you to agree the actions that will get vaccines where they are most needed, fast. Other signatories include actors Liam Neeson, Orlando Bloom, Gemma Chan, and Whoopi Goldberg, singers Katy Perry and P!nk, and UK tennis ace Andy Murray. The letter also warned that Covax, the global initiative supporting poorer countries in gaining access to vaccines, is facing a shortfall of 190 million doses. Unicef has proposed that G7 countries should donate 20% of their vaccines between June and August to help address the shortages temporarily. “As a Unicef goodwill ambassador I believe in the crucial benefit of vaccinations,” said former England footballer Beckham. “The pandemic won’t be over until it’s over everywhere, so it’s vital that all communities around the world have fair access to Covid-19 vaccines urgently.” More than 1 million Europeans have received the new EU Covid health certificate being rolled out to unlock travel within the bloc, the European Commission has said. AFP reports: EU justice commissioner Didier Reynders announced the figure to the European parliament ahead of a vote to enshrine the document in law in time for the continent’s summer tourism season. The certificate – showing the bearer’s immunity to Covid-19 either through vaccination or previous infection, or their negative test status – is to be used for intra-EU travel from 1 July. But the commission wants as many EU countries as possible to start earlier. “The more certificates we can already issue, the easier the process will be during the summer - otherwise, we risk a big bang on the first of July, which we cannot afford,” Reynders said. As of today, nine EU countries were already issuing the documents, with more than a million citizens have received such certificates – which can be presented either online or on paper – already. EU lawmakers and capitals also agreed that, when it comes to proof of vaccinations, only the jabs authorised by the European Medicines Agency – so far those from BioNTech/Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson – would be accepted in all EU countries. But individual countries can also decide to accept, for their territory only, others, such as one produced by China, or Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine. To prevent discrimination against the unvaccinated - particularly younger Europeans who have not yet been able to access jabs given in priority to the elderly - much emphasis has also been put on testing. The parliament failed to make Covid tests for travel free of charge, but extracted money and concessions from the European Commission to make them more affordable. As we emerge from a widespread internet outage, a top Japanese virologist and government adviser has said there is a risk of spreading Covid-19 during the Tokyo Olympics. Tohoku University professor Hitoshi Oshitani was an architect of Japan’s “Three Cs” approach to the pandemic, which advises avoiding closed spaces, crowds and close contact situations. He told the Times: The government and the organising committee, including the IOC (International Olympic Committee), keep saying they’re holding a safe Olympics. But everybody knows there is a risk. It’s 100% impossible to have an Olympics with zero risk … of the spread of infection in Japan and also in other countries after the Olympics. There are a number of countries that do not have many cases, and a number that don’t have any variants. We should not make the Olympics [an occasion] to spread the virus to these countries. Already postponed from last year because of the pandemic, a scaled-down version of the Games with no foreign spectators is set to start on 23 July despite public fears the event could spread the coronavirus and drain medical resources. However, a former Olympian turned public health expert, said she believed the Games can be pulled off with an acceptable level of risk. “There will be cases, but having one case or a couple of cases doesn’t mean that it was a failure,” Tara Kirk Sell, a professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told Reuters. Sell, a silver medallist swimmer at the 2004 Games, added: “These Games are very much a symbol of the whole world emerging from this terrible, global pandemic … If we wanted to be as safe as possible, we’d never leave our house.” Amid the outage, my colleague Martin Belam handed over the blog, so it will be me Mattha Busby bringing you global coronavirus updates for the next couple of hours. You may contact me via email on mattha.busby.freelance@guardian.co.uk or on Twitter. Please do get in touch with any tips or thoughts. China has approved the emergency use of a Covid-19 vaccine for those as young as three, according to a spokesperson for Sinovac. That would make it the first country to offer jabs to young children. Britain ignored scientific advice and instead took a political decision when it failed to put Malta on its list of safe travel destinations, Malta foreign minister Evarist Bartolo said. Visitors to Portugal must now quarantine for 10 days on return to England, as the county’s move to the “red list” came into effect. Vietnam has started asking for public donations to buy vaccines as it struggles to contain a new coronavirus wave. Unicef has urged rich members of the G7 to start donating vaccines to poor countries now, instead of waiting to donate leftovers all at once, saying many nations don’t have capacity to roll out huge amounts in one go. India’s government will provide free vaccinations for all adults, Prime Minister Narendra Modi says, as the capital New Delhi and financial hub Mumbai ease lockdowns on falling infection levels. The state of Uttar Pradesh in India has announced that it will end some Covid restrictions. The weekday daytime curfew would be lifted in all 75 districts of the state, as all of them have fallen below 600 active Covid cases. The president of the Tokyo 2020 organizsing committee, Seiko Hashimoto, has announced that there will be restrictions on the movement media using GPS tracking during the Games. New Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Tuesday that she would get her first Covid-19 shot at the end of next week. Canada is preparing to ease birder restrictions for vaccinated travellers, Bloomberg reports. The Czech Republic has announced it will reopen its borders to EU and Serbian citizens on June 21. Spain’s football squad will be get a Covid-19 vaccine shot, less than a week before their opening Euro 2020 match, after captain Sergio Busquets tested positive. Health officials in New South Wales, Australia, have had to reiterate advice over Covid-19 after a number of businesses in Byron Shire were witnessed asking vaccinated customers not to enter their premises under the misapprehension they could shed the virus. Vietnam, once a model for its successful handling of the pandemic, has started asking for public donations to buy vaccines as it struggles to contain a new coronavirus wave. AFP reports that the south-east Asian country has vaccinated only about 1% of its population of nearly 100 million, and authorities have become increasingly alarmed by a recent spike in cases. Since last week, mobile phone users have received up to three text messages urging them to contribute to a Covid-19 vaccine fund, while civil servants have been encouraged to part with a day’s pay. Some residents, fearful of the virus’ impact on Vietnam’s economy – one of the few in the world to expand last year – told AFP they support the fundraising drive. Nguyen Tuan Anh, a civil servant, told AFP he had sent about $50 via bank transfer and SMS payment, as vaccines would mean “Vietnam’s economy will be stable and develop again”. Vietnam’s industrial northern provinces – home to key factories such as Samsung and Foxconn – have been particularly badly hit by the latest outbreak. Across the country, tens of thousands of people have lost their jobs, according to state media, with bars and restaurants forced to close in major hubs such as Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City and public gatherings cancelled. Cases have more than tripled since April to reach almost 9,000. Although the number is low in comparison to most of its south-east Asian neighbours, Vietnam’s vaccination rate per capita is the lowest in the region, and among the lowest in Asia, according to an AFP tally. The Spanish football squad’s players will be get a Covid-19 vaccine shot tomorrow, less than a week before their opening Euro 2020 match, after captain Sergio Busquets tested positive, Sports Minister Jose Manuel Rodriguez Uribes said. Busquets’ positive has thrown Spain’s tournament preparations into chaos with the remaining 23 players going into isolation along with the coaching staff. An Under-21 side led by their coach Luis de la Fuente will face Lithuania tonight in what was supposed to be the nation’s final warm-up game before the Euros. Coach Luis Enrique called up a group of six players, including Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga, to complement the squad. They will train separately in “parallel bubble” away from the main Euros squad with a view to them being added should the need occur. Reuters report that so far, all the other players and staff have tested negative. “We are making an exception because they represent us in a top level competition,” Rodriguez Uribes told Cadena Ser radio station, adding that they were already planning to give them the shots before Spain’s captain had tested positive. Health officials in New South Wales, Australia, have had to reiterate advice over Covid-19 after a number of businesses in Byron Shire were witnessed asking vaccinated customers not to enter their premises under the misapprehension they could shed the virus. The New South Wales department of health has stressed that it is impossible for people to develop, shed, or spread the virus through receiving a vaccine. The advice comes after some businesses in the small town of Mullumbimby placed signs in their windows that read: ‘If you have had the Covid-19 vaccine we ask you not to enter for two weeks or longer until any symptoms subside’. One of the signs falsely states that the spread of the virus following vaccination was emerging from “first hand accounts” and that vaccinated people were “inadvertently harming” the health of others. The town is located in the Northern Rivers region of New South Wales and is about 15km inland from Byron Bay. It is a region with a high level of vaccine hesitancy and refusal, with childhood vaccination rates among the lowest in Australia. A former paramedic who runs a World Health Organisation [WHO] approved vaccination information website, Heidi Robertson, said she was appalled to see the signs as she walked down Stuart Street on Monday. She and health professionals living in the region, including intensive care specialist Dr Rachael Heap, have been working hard for several years to educate the community about vaccination. “We wanted to change the narrative around the region, because we’ve got such a shocking rate of vaccination uptake and we are known for that in Mullumbimby,” Robertson said. Read more of Melissa Davey’s report here: ‘Vaccine won’t give you Covid’: health officials battle anti-vaccination messages in Northern Rivers Andrew Sparrow’s UK live blog is up and running for the day if it is UK developments that you are after. I’ll keep my focus on international Covid news here. A total of 95 deaths registered in England and Wales in the week ending 28 May mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) - the lowest number since the week ending 4 September 2020. PA note that the figure is down 11% on the previous week. It is the first time the number of deaths has been below 100 since the week ending 11 September. Around one in 100 deaths registered in the week to 28 May mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate. China has approved the emergency use of a Covid-19 vaccine for those as young as three, according to a spokesperson for Sinovac who spoke to AFP. That would make it the first country to offer jabs to young children. “In recent days, the Sinovac vaccine was approved for emergency use in three- to 17-year-olds,” the spokesperson said. But they did not confirm when the young children would be able to start receiving the shots, saying the schedule for the rollout will be decided by the National Health Commission “according to China’s current epidemic prevention and control needs and vaccine supply”. The company has completed early phase trials of the vaccine in children and adolescents, with results to be published shortly in the Lancet scientific journal, the spokesperson added. State broadcaster CCTV reported over the weekend that an unnamed official in the State Council’s epidemic response task force had said vaccines had been approved for children, and “the safety and effectiveness” had been proven. A spokesperson for China’s other major vaccine, Sinopharm, said that experts had demonstrated the effectiveness of its vaccine in children, but didn’t confirm whether it had been approved for use. A quick one from Reuters: Russia reported 9,977 new Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, including 3,817 in Moscow. The government coronavirus task force also said that 379 people had died of coronavirus-related causes in the last 24 hours, pushing the official death toll to 124,496. That’s far fewer than the 270,000 that the state statistics service says had died from Covid-19 and related causes from April 2020 to April 2021. Britain ignored scientific advice and instead took a political decision when it failed to put Malta on its list of safe travel destinations, Malta Foreign Minister Evarist Bartolo said. Britons traditionally account for a third of all arrivals on the small Mediterranean island, and opposition politicians criticised the government for failing to convince London that Malta was a safe tourist destination. Britain last week revised its so-called “green list” of countries, that do not require quarantine on return, choosing not to put any new country on it, while removing Portugal. But Bartolo said the British government did not want its nationals to go abroad because of concerns over growing coronavirus cases at home. “The British government is ignoring scientific advice. It has taken a political decision not to allow travel anywhere, despite the pressure it faces from airlines, tourism operators and the people in general,” he wrote on Facebook. Chris Scicluna reports from Valetta for Reuters that Malta on Monday reported no new Covid-19 cases for the first time in 11 months. Half of its adult population has been fully vaccinated and 75% have received a first dose of a vaccine - the highest rate within the European Union. Dr Nikki Kanani, director of primary care at NHS England, said that vaccine confidence in younger people had increased in the UK. Speaking as over-25s were invited to book their Covid-19 jabs, PA report Dr Kanani told BBC Breakfast: “We’re still seeing great uptake and we are definitely seeing younger people coming in and asking more questions, which is absolutely fine. “More than four in five 40 to 49-year-olds have had their first dose and two-thirds of 30 to 39-year-olds have already had theirs, and that is still going to increase, of course, as people come forward, so uptake remains high. “We had additional polling over the weekend that shows that the confidence in the vaccine has increased by a fifth - by 20% - in those under-40s. “What’s really important as we go into the younger categories is really appealing to people in their own communities and what our teams have done so well is reflect what a community needs locally - whether that’s setting up pop-up vaccination centres in Gurudwaras or temples, or in shopping malls or at workplaces, that has been critical to making sure that people feel confident to take up the vaccine when they’re asked to do so.” Overnight saw a rush to travel back to the UK from Portugal, as travellers had until 4am to return to avoid having to quarantine for 10 days after the country was moved from the “green” list to the “amber” list, without being placed on a watchlist first. The UK’s environment minister has been getting a tough ride on the media morning round in the UK – being asked whether the travel rules, and government advice, have to be this complicated, and why there was so little warning of the change of status. Eustace said “Our advice has always been that you should not travel to countries on the amber list.” The Gaby Hinsliff column today asks the question before Britain vaccinates children, should it vaccinate the world? She writes: Personally I was thrilled to get my vaccine and would be more than happy for my son to have it, but what brought me up short was the question I saw posed recently by the epidemiologist Adam Kucharski: if rich countries have enough vaccine left to jab children at incredibly low risk of serious illness and death, why aren’t they offering it to poorer countries where people are dying for lack of it? Shouldn’t we be taking more seriously the threat not just of humanitarian crises, but of a more resistant variant emerging in some place where the virus is currently raging out of control, fatally undermining the vaccines that remain our only real route to freedom? Only 2% of sub-Saharan Africa has had a first dose. Thailand, engulfed by a severe outbreak, is only just beginning mass vaccinations. Even if the G7 summit agrees this week to invest billions in ramping up vaccine production for poorer countries – as a group of former world leaders led by Gordon Brown wants – that takes months to come on stream. If Britain doesn’t want to seal its borders – and nothing in ministers’ confused approach to foreign holidays suggests they do – then digging an ever-stronger domestic firebreak against the more contagious Delta variant we have just imported from India won’t be enough. We’re going to need a global firebreak against something worse evolving too, and fast. Read more here: Gaby Hinsliff – Before Britain vaccinates children, should it vaccinate the world? Helen Davidson reports from Taipei: Some tentative good news from Taiwan, with a second consecutive day of cases in the 200s and no new cases from backlogged test results. As long as results are not down because of lower weekend testing, the decline is a positive sign in Taiwan’s battle against its worst outbreak of the pandemic. However with about 8,000 cases still active, fatalities have not stopped and authorities reported another 22 deaths. The new cases were mostly in New Taipei city, with 123 recorded. Another 54 were reported from the capital Taipei, while 16 were found in Miaoli where there are growing concerns over an outbreak among employees from three factories which has so far infected 211 people. Health and welfare minister, Chen Chih-shung, said the rate of positive cases in New Taipei was dropping but there was no room yet to relax current restrictions. He urged people not to travel during an upcoming long weekend and dragon-boat festival, which authorities have not cancelled. Vaccine supplies took another hit, with authorities saying expected shipments of AstraZeneca and from Covax had been delayed by about a month. Half of the 150,000 recently obtained Moderna vaccines have been allocated to frontline medical staff. China’s vaccination numbers are never low. Official figures reported by Reuters say that the nation administered about 16.3 million doses of vaccine on 7 June, bringing the total number administered to 794m. In India, the state of Uttar Pradesh has announced that it will end some Covid restrictions. The Hindustan Times reports this morning: The Uttar Pradesh government on Tuesday gave relaxations in ‘corona curfew’ in all 75 districts of the state. According to guidelines announced by the state government, districts with less than 600 active cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) can get relaxations. A state government spokesperson said that there will be relaxation in coronavirus curfew in all the districts of the state from Wednesday onwards, from 7am to 7pm, for five days. However, the night curfew – 7pm to 7am and weekend curfew (for entire day) – will continue. The UK’s environment secretary George Eustace – a man who clearly isn’t in the position where he hasn’t seen family and loved ones abroad for over a year due to travel bans – has told Sky News this morning: “I have no intention of travelling or going on a holiday abroad this summer.” He was being pressed by newly returned presenter Kay Burley on the scramble for flights back from Portugal after it was moved from the “green list” to the “amber list” with very little warning. PA Media quotes him saying: Our advice has been don’t travel unless it’s absolutely necessary. Obviously we had hoped, with these three categories that we had, we had hoped that situation would be improving in other parts of the world, that we’d be able to progressively add other countries to the green list. Sadly, that’s not the situation, we do have this new variant of concern first identified in India that is now cropping up in other countries, and we’ve just got to take a very cautious approach. Asked about the UK government’s delay in shutting down travel from India, he said “India was added as soon as we saw a spike in rates and as soon as we saw there was a reason to”, denying that the delay had been political. At the time Indian case numbers were rising and the government took no action, UK prime minister Boris Johnson had been planning to visit India in his first major trip abroad since the pandemic, with the aim of pushing a post-Brexit UK-India trade deal. Unicef has urged rich members of the G7 to start donating vaccines to poor countries now, instead of waiting to donate leftovers all at once, saying many nations don’t have capacity to roll out huge amounts in one go. Unicef’s vaccine lead Lily Caprani told BBC Newsnight governments in the UK and other G7 nations “need to donate their doses to those low income countries now, while still vaccinating their populations at home.” “Low income countries need a steady supply that they can get off the tarmac and into the arms of health care workers... The unintended consequence of saving all these vaccines up to Christmas time is that countries won’t be able to absorb them and roll them out and therefore they could end up going to waste. We could see millions of doses of vaccines not used and expiring, and that will be a tragedy.” The World Health Organization has also called on Covid-19 vaccine manufacturers to give the Covax scheme first refusal on new doses, or commit half of their volumes to the global jab equity scheme. Our health editor Sarah Boseley asks the question this morning: Can we vaccinate the world against Covid by the end of 2022? As ambitious declarations go – even for Boris Johnson – it was a big one. At the weekend, the UK prime minister said he would urge the G7 leaders to vaccinate the world against Covid by the end of next year. But is this feasible? That rather depends on your definition. No country will vaccinate every adult. Vaccinating enough to achieve herd immunity, which could be 60% or 70%, is the real aim. It is possible to achieve that by December 2023, say experts, but only if the G7 leading economies move immediately to make it happen. The Covax scheme under the UN umbrella should have been the route to vaccination for low-income countries. It was designed as their lifeline. Covax signed contracts with manufacturers to buy 2bn doses by the end of this year. But it is stymied. Its main supplier is the Serum Institute of India, which is now churning out vaccines in response to the terrible surge in domestic cases and deaths and will not be able to fulfil its contracts to Covax or individual countries before the end of the year. Dr Bruce Aylward, senior adviser to the director general of the World Health Organization, who is heavily involved in the vaccine efforts, said: “This is where the UK becomes really important and the G7, because right now we’ve got this gap of death. In June, July, August, September, there’s no vaccine out there for love nor money, in terms of being able to procure it.” Read more of Sarah Boseley’s analysis here: Can we vaccinate the world against Covid by the end of 2022? The president of the Tokyo 2020 organising committee, Seiko Hashimoto, is speaking this morning, and she is setting out some of the procedures that will be undertaken to try to keep the games safe. So far, she’s said that media will not be able to use shared accommodation, and that the media will be GPS-tracked to ensure they don’t go into unauthorised areas. She has also said that they expect to start vaccinating Olympics-related staff by mid-June. Reuters note that foreign spectators have already been banned, and organisers are expected to make a decision late this month on domestic spectators. Toshiaki Endo, the vice-president of the Tokyo organising committee, has previously suggested to Reuters some spectators could be allowed into venues, although he personally preferred a total ban to calm persistent public opposition to the Games. On the downside, I just saw this tweet today, and now I can’t stop thinking about it either… Good morning, it is Martin Belam here in London taking over today’s blog. The biggest news in England is the extension of vaccinations to those aged 25 and over this morning. If you fall into that category you can book your shot at the NHS England site here. Northern Ireland has already been offering vaccines to anybody over 18, you can find out more here. Those in Scotland and Wales can find out the latest information for them here: NHS Scotland Gov.wales Reuters: New Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Tuesday that she would get her first Covid-19 shot at the end of next week, as the country prepared to receive another 1 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine. “For me, it’s been important that I allow those in the most at risk group... to be prioritised,” Ardern said in a news conference. “I’m choosing to be vaccinated at this point in order to play my role in demonstrating that I consider it to be absolutely safe and also really critical to keep others safe,” she said. China today pledged further assistance to Southeast Asian nations in battling the pandemic, the Associated Press reports. The country’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, told his Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) counterparts that China had already delivered 100 million doses of vaccine to Asean nations along with other materials and technical help. Wang said China would “urgently implement” the China-Asean Public Health Cooperation Initiative, continue to support the Asean Emergency Medical Materials Reserve and strengthen regional public health capacity-building. “China will work with Asean to overcome the outbreak as soon as possible,” Wang told a meeting of ministers. He said the sides should explore establishing an expert panel to strengthen cooperation throughout the vaccine process, from research to use, and work to build production and distribution centres to help make vaccines affordable and accessible in the region. Though Covid-19 was first detected in China in late 2019, the nation has largely stamped out domestic transmission, although it has been accused of insufficient transparency or even seeking to conceal the origins of the pandemic. Beijing has been building influence with Asean, despite frictions with some members of the bloc over competing territorial claims in the South China Sea. Welcome to another day of the pandemic, and our continuing global coverage of the latest developments. Below are some of the key updates from the last day. Canada is preparing to ease birder restrictions for vaccinated travellers, Bloomberg reports. A top Japanese virologist and government adviser has warned of the risks of spreading infections during the Tokyo Olympics. Australia’s state of Victoria is on track to ease restrictions on residents, currently in a lockdown to deal with an outbreak of the Delta variant, authorities said. India’s government will provide free vaccinations for all adults, Prime Minister Narendra Modi says, as the capital New Delhi and financial hub Mumbai ease lockdowns on falling infection levels. A new coronavirus antibody drug appears to show promise in mouse studies, according to a study published in Nature. The Czech Republic has announced it will reopen its borders to EU and Serbian citizens on June 21. Just days before the start of the Euros, Spain’s football players and staff have returned negative Covid-19 tests after captain Sergio Busquets had to go home and quarantine. There was “delight across Ireland” as the country reopened pubs, restaurants and leisure facilities. Central Park is to host an “all-star” concert in August to mark New York’s comeback after the pandemic. New York governor Andrew Cuomo has announced that the state’s remaining coronavirus restrictions will be lifted when 70% of residents have had at least one vaccine dose.","charCount":"47994","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/rhi-storer\">Rhi Storer</a> (now); <a href=\"profile/mattha-busby\">Mattha Busby</a>, <a href=\"profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a> and <a href=\"profile/helen-davidson\">Helen Davidson</a> (earlier)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2021/jun/08/florence-griffith-joyner-trailblazing-fashion-movie-tiffany-haddish","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-08T15:07:07Z","webTitle":"Florence Griffith Joyner’s trailblazing fashion sprints to the front with film","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2021/jun/08/florence-griffith-joyner-trailblazing-fashion-movie-tiffany-haddish","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2021/jun/08/florence-griffith-joyner-trailblazing-fashion-movie-tiffany-haddish","fields":{"headline":"Florence Griffith Joyner’s trailblazing fashion sprints to the front with film","standfirst":"<p>Tiffany Haddish to produce and star in biopic about Olympic champion who shot to fame in the 1980s and blurred lines between sportswear and the catwalk<br></p>","trailText":"Tiffany Haddish to produce and star in biopic about Olympic champion who shot to fame in the 1980s and blurred lines between sportswear and the catwalk<br>","byline":"Priya Elan","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc4dc961155ed401d1b4acac84a1883ca6027c50\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc4dc961155ed401d1b4acac84a1883ca6027c50/0_318_2776_1665/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Florence Griffith Joyner celebrates her gold medal win at the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul. \" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Florence Griffith Joyner celebrates her gold medal win at the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BTS</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>The news that <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/tiffany-haddish-to-star-in-produce-biopic-on-olympian-and-1980s-icon-florence-griffith-joyner-1234962625/\">Tiffany Haddish</a> will produce and star in a film about Florence Griffith Joyner has renewed attention on the Olympic champion’s brilliant if <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/london-2012-olympics-blog/2012/apr/11/olympic-florence-griffith-joyner-seoul\">controversial</a> career – and shone new light on her trailblazing fashion.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/london-2012-olympics-blog/2012/apr/11/olympic-florence-griffith-joyner-seoul\">50 stunning Olympic moments No22: Florence Griffith Joyner, Seoul 1988 | Simon Burnton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the late 1980s, when the sprinter shot to fame, no one looked like her. “Flo-Jo” competed in outfits that were part-rock star, part-cartoon crusader, a unique look to which Beyoncé and Serena Williams have recently paid tribute.</p> <p>Announcing her project, Haddish said she was “looking forward to telling Flo-Jo’s story the way it should be told.

The tax was launched last year as a stopgap measure until a global deal could be reached.</p> <p>TaxWatch said the UK tax bills paid by these firms would fall to just over £100m under the G7 plan.</p> <p>The campaign group calculated the sum by analysing the UK accounts of each company for 2019, the most recent year when data was available. Although precise details of the global tax changes are still being negotiated and limited information has been published so far, the group estimated tax liabilities based on details in the G7 communique published last weekend.</p> <p>According to the research Google is estimated to contribute £219m to the digital services tax but would pay just £60m to the UK exchequer under the G7 plan.</p> <p>For Facebook the tax take would fall from £58m to £28m. For Amazon it would drop from £50m to £10m, and for eBay from £19m to £3.8m.</p> <p>The figures are estimates because the Treasury does not publish a breakdown of the amount each firm contributes to its digital services tax.</p> <p>Raising questions over whether the proposals would become a reality, sources said the UK and EU nations were continuing to push for more in tax to be raised within their borders by large US tech companies. It comes ahead of the next key moment for tax reforms, at a meeting of the G20 in Venice in July.</p> <p>Chris Sanger, global government and risk tax leader at the accountancy firm EY, said: “The UK will not want to turn off the taxing of those global multinationals, under the digital services tax, until it feels it has another tax that can deliver equally or better. There is still a lot of detail to be worked through in this space.”</p> <p>At the heart of the issue are the two “pillars” in the G7 deal: one enables countries to tax large company profits based on their sales in that market, and a second sets a minimum global corporation tax rate. The global minimum would be set at a rate of at least 15% and capture thousands of firms and be paid in their home countries.</p> <p>Because so many multinationals have their headquarters in the US, other nations are demanding that the largest companies also pay tax in nations where they generate their revenues. So under pillar one, the UK should receive a portion of the tax generated in the country by Apple and Facebook.</p> <p>A mechanism for redistributing the profits of the largest companies is under discussion.

In a key stumbling block emerging days after the landmark deal, research from the TaxWatch campaign group indicates that the UK Treasury stands to lose about £230m from the taxes paid each year by four of the big US tech firms. The study estimates that Facebook, Google, eBay, and Amazon, contribute about £330m between them to the UK’s digital services tax – a levy on internet search providers, online marketplaces and social media firms. The tax was launched last year as a stopgap measure until a global deal could be reached. TaxWatch said the UK tax bills paid by these firms would fall to just over £100m under the G7 plan. The campaign group calculated the sum by analysing the UK accounts of each company for 2019, the most recent year when data was available. Although precise details of the global tax changes are still being negotiated and limited information has been published so far, the group estimated tax liabilities based on details in the G7 communique published last weekend. According to the research Google is estimated to contribute £219m to the digital services tax but would pay just £60m to the UK exchequer under the G7 plan. For Facebook the tax take would fall from £58m to £28m. For Amazon it would drop from £50m to £10m, and for eBay from £19m to £3.8m. The figures are estimates because the Treasury does not publish a breakdown of the amount each firm contributes to its digital services tax. Raising questions over whether the proposals would become a reality, sources said the UK and EU nations were continuing to push for more in tax to be raised within their borders by large US tech companies. It comes ahead of the next key moment for tax reforms, at a meeting of the G20 in Venice in July. Chris Sanger, global government and risk tax leader at the accountancy firm EY, said: “The UK will not want to turn off the taxing of those global multinationals, under the digital services tax, until it feels it has another tax that can deliver equally or better. There is still a lot of detail to be worked through in this space.” At the heart of the issue are the two “pillars” in the G7 deal: one enables countries to tax large company profits based on their sales in that market, and a second sets a minimum global corporation tax rate. The global minimum would be set at a rate of at least 15% and capture thousands of firms and be paid in their home countries. Because so many multinationals have their headquarters in the US, other nations are demanding that the largest companies also pay tax in nations where they generate their revenues. So under pillar one, the UK should receive a portion of the tax generated in the country by Apple and Facebook. A mechanism for redistributing the profits of the largest companies is under discussion. A list of 100 companies whose profits could be divvied up in this way was presented at the G7. The list remains confidential, though is understood to include tech companies, but not banks or extractive firms such as mining and oil groups. The redistribution mechanism would apply to companies with “superprofits” – profit margins exceeding 10% of revenues. Although experts believe pillar one redistribution would generate relatively little for the UK, the Treasury would still gain an estimated £7.9bn each year from the global minimum rate under pillar two. This is because the global minimum tax is paid to a firm’s home country, and the UK has several large multinationals on its shores that would be caught. Analysts at the EU Tax Observatory have suggested firms such as BT, Barclays, HSBC and BP, could be caught up in the pillar two arrangement. Sources close to the tax reforms, which are being negotiated between 139 countries at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), said the UK and EU finance ministries were pushing for tougher concessions from Washington to raise more in tax from large US companies outside of their home jurisdiction. The Biden administration has however focused minds by threatening to impose punitive tariffs on imports from the UK and five other countries in retaliation for digital services taxes recently imposed on US corporations. Tax campaigners warned that lower-income countries, which do not have multinationals based on their shores to benefit from a global minimum tax, would not stand to gain much from the limited amount of tax to be raised from pillar one. This could become a key sticking point at wider G20 talks in Venice next month. George Turner, director of TaxWatch, said: “It seems to me this is a good deal for the US, they get to tax their multinationals more, and they get to protect themselves from companies trying to [go] offshore by making it a global deal. “The fact Facebook and Google end up paying less tax in the UK under this deal is controversial, I don’t think you can get away from that.

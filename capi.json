He is adamant that DeJoy has not knowingly broken any laws. <br></p> <p>“Mr DeJoy has learned that the Department of Justice is investigating campaign contributions made by employees who worked for him when he was in the private sector,” Corallo is quoted as saying. “He has always been scrupulous in his adherence to the campaign contribution laws and has never knowingly violated them.”<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The investigation might suggest looming legal problems for DeJoy.

Nancy Pelosi said on a Democratic caucus call on Tuesday that she was also against the idea of a presidential commission because such a body would lack subpoena authority or funding without a statutory change. Benjamin Netanyahu has fought back against what he slammed as a “dangerous” coalition of opposition parties that were rushing to establish a government aimed at unseating the country’s longest-serving leader. A day after the opposition head, Yair Lapid, announced that he and Naftali Bennett – his far-right partner and prime minister in waiting – could form a “government of change”, the race was on to get it voted on in parliament and sworn in. The process could take two weeks or more, all while the coalition remains vulnerable to collapse. It is composed of a mix of bitter ideological rivals, including Jewish religious nationalists and Arab Islamists, who are united only by a shared desire to oust Netanyahu. On Thursday, the opposition was scrambling to get the speaker of the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, to schedule a vote of confidence in the proposed government. However, the speaker, Yariv Levin, is a member of Netanyahu’s Likud party and has powers to delay, giving his boss more time to manoeuvre. The far-right politician Avigdor Lieberman, a member of the new coalition, warned that the interim period could allow Netanyahu – famed for political acrobatics – to find kinks in the plan. “We launched the move, but we haven’t completed it. There will be 12 days that won’t be easy,” Lieberman told Channel 13 TV. However, he added: “In the end, there will be a government.” Donald Trump has reportedly been speaking more seriously in recent weeks about the possibility of launching another presidential campaign in 2024. The AP reports: [M]ultiple people who have spoken with Trump and his team in recent weeks say [remarks about running in 2024] shouldn’t be viewed as idle chatter. Instead, they sense a shift, with Trump increasingly acting and talking like he plans to mount a run as he embarks on a more public phase of his post-presidency, beginning with a speech on Saturday in North Carolina. The report comes as the former president has continued to put out statements encouraging the controversial Republican-led “audit” of 2020 ballots in Maricopa county, Arizona. According to New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman, Trump has been telling allies that he expects to be reinstated as president by August. (That is obviously not possible because Trump fairly lost the presidential election to Joe Biden, who was sworn in more than four months ago.) Parts of the memorial space constructed at the south Minneapolis intersection where George Floyd was murdered by a white police officer were removed by work crews on Thursday morning. The city confirmed to the Guardian that barricades had been taken down to allow the intersection to be reopened to traffic, as reporters on the ground confirmed the presence of a large group of workers early in the morning. The deconstruction work appeared to have ceased within a few hours. Floyd, 46, was killed by white Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin in May 2020. Shortly after the incident community members turned the intersection where Floyd took his last breaths into a public mourning space, named George Floyd Square. The space, which became a de facto autonomous zone in which city police stayed away, features community art, sculptures and often hosts performances and protests. In an email, city spokeswoman Sarah McKenzie described the work as a “community-led reconnection process with city supporting efforts”. She added that more information on the work would be forthcoming, and that “artworks and memorials to George Floyd” would be preserved. Joe Biden has signed an executive order expanding the list of Chinese companies that are banned from receiving US investment because of their alleged ties to China’s military. The Wall Street Journal has more details on the order: An executive order Mr. Biden signed Thursday brings to 59 the total number of Chinese companies banned from receiving American investment and shows how his administration is continuing some of the hard-line China policies left by former President Donald Trump. The new order prevents Americans from investing in those companies, with a 60-day grace period, until Aug. 2, before sanctions begin and a one-year period for Americans already invested in the firms—either directly or via mutual and index or other funds—to divest themselves. The action is one of the firmest to date as the Biden administration conducts a broad review of China policy, including how to deal with tariffs and other trade measures taken by Mr. Trump. So far the administration has advanced few concrete actions against Beijing, though the U.S. recently joined allies in imposing sanctions against Chinese officials engaged in the mass incarceration of mainly Muslim ethnic minorities in the Xinjiang region. In his recent speeches, Biden has emphasized the importance of the US adequately competing with China in the global marketplace. Speaking in Ohio last week, Biden said of electric vehicles, “We want to lead the world in exports of these new technologies instead of ceding the global market and job creation to the Chinese.” Federal law enforcement authorities are investigating controversial US Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, in relation to political fundraising that involved his former company, the Washington Post reports. FBI agents recently interviewed present and former employees who worked for DeJoy and his business, according to the Post’s report Thursday afternoon. They are asking about campaign contributions and business activities, sources told the newspaper. Prosecutors also hit DeJoy with a subpoena for information, per the report. DeJoy’s spokesman, Mark Corallo, has reportedly confirmed that there is an investigation. He is adamant that DeJoy has not knowingly broken any laws. “Mr DeJoy has learned that the Department of Justice is investigating campaign contributions made by employees who worked for him when he was in the private sector,” Corallo is quoted as saying. “He has always been scrupulous in his adherence to the campaign contribution laws and has never knowingly violated them.” The investigation might suggest looming legal problems for DeJoy. He has not been charged with any crime and has maintained that the campaign fundraising complied with the law. The Post has reported in September that staffers at DeJoy’s former business in North Carolina, New Breed Logistics, claimed that he or his aides pressured them to patronize fundraising events or contribute to GOP candidates. These employees alleged that they were reimbursed through bonuses. This sort of repayment could violate federal or state campaign contribution laws that bar “straw-donor” setups, which enable deep-pocketed donors to eschew contribution limits. Straw donors can also obscure the source of politicians’ funds. DeJoy is a “prominent GOP fundraiser, who personally gave more than $1.1m to the joint fundraising vehicle of President Donald Trump’s reelection campaign and the Republican party,” the newspaper notes. The postal service’s board of governors appointed DeJoy to postmaster general in May 2020. DeJoy’s tenure in the postal service has been contentious. Shortly after DeJoy assumed his role, he enacted cost reduction initiatives that prompted limits to overtime and limiting mail runs, spurring delivery delays. Democrats have claimed that DeJoy was trying to weaken the postal service in advance of the election, as Trump vehemently distrusted mail-in voting, the Post explains. DeJoy has previously insisted that he was not trying to impact the election. “I am not engaged in sabotaging the election,” DeJoy reportedly said at an August congressional hearing. “We will do everything in our power and structure to deliver the ballots on time.” The New York City mayoral race exploded into life on Wednesday night, as the Democratic primary debate saw candidates clash over whether to rein in or bolster the city’s beleaguered police force, and the two centrist frontrunners found themselves variously attacked as Republicans or gun-toters. Andrew Yang and Eric Adams, who are leading the polls along with Kathryn Garcia, the city’s former sanitation commissioner, were the focus of their rivals during the debate, as eight candidates pitched themselves to be mayor of the biggest city in the US – a role once dubbed the “second toughest job in America”. The winner of the Democratic primary later this month is expected to triumph in the mayoral election proper in November, lending an extra frisson to proceedings. But less than three weeks before New Yorkers go to the polls, the debate offered little hope for progressives seeking systemic change. Poverty and homelessness, which have continued to blight New York City under the last eight years of a Democratic mayor, were left by the wayside as law and order became an enduring topic. After a year where tens of thousands of New Yorkers called for the police department (NYPD) to be cut in size amid protests against police brutality and racism, it was Yang, a tech entrepreneur who ran a high-profile campaign for US president last year, who took the remarkable position of calling for the NYPD to expand. Here’s where the day stands so far: The Biden administration outlined plans to share 80 million coronavirus vaccine doses with other countries. The president previously indicated he hoped to distribute the doses to foreign allies by the end of June. In a statement about the plan, Joe Biden said, “We are sharing these doses not to secure favors or extract concessions. We are sharing these vaccines to save lives and to lead the world in bringing an end to the pandemic, with the power of our example and with our values.” Biden will meet with Queen Elizabeth and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson when he travels to the UK for the G-7 summit this month. Biden will meet with Johnson on June 10, the day before the summit begins in Cornwall, and the US president and first lady will meet with the queen at Windsor Castle on June 13. Biden has proposed a new, minimum corporate tax of 15% to help pay for an infrastructure bill. Biden raised the idea with Republican Senator Shelley Moore Capito during their meeting yesterday, walking back his initial proposal to raise the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%, which had attracted intense Republican criticism. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. The Guardian’s David Smith asked Jen Psaki about Joe Biden’s meetings with Queen Elizabeth and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson when he travels to the UK for the G-7 summit this month. Psaki said Biden’s meeting with Johnson would allow the two leaders to reaffirm the “special relationship” between the US and the UK while discussing the many issues that impact both countries. Asked if Biden is looking forward to meeting the queen, Psaki replied, “Who among us wouldn’t want to meet the queen?” The press secretary said she believed Biden and the queen have met before, but she added that she would have to verify the details of that. The White House briefing has now ended. Jen Psaki said she did not consider Monday to be the deadline for reaching a bipartisan deal on an infrastructure bill. The White House press secretary said Joe Biden will “continue to have conversations with Democrats and Republicans about what the path forward may look like”. Transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg said Sunday that there needs to be “a clear direction” on infrastructure talks by the time Congress returns from its recess, which is Monday. But the White House appears to be walking away from that timeline. As Jen Psaki briefs the press, Joe and Jill Biden are enjoying a bike ride in Rehoboth Beach, where they are celebrating the first lady’s 70th birthday. The president gave a wave to reporters as he rode past them: The first couple arrived yesterday in Rehoboth, where they have owned a beach house since 2017, shortly after Biden’s time as vice-president concluded. The president is scheduled to return to Washington tomorrow, when he will resume talks with Republicans about a potential infrastructure deal. Jen Psaki was asked about Joe Biden’s new proposal to help pay for an infrastructure bill by creating a new, minimum corporate tax of 15%. The White House press secretary argued the proposal should be “completely acceptable” to many Republicans because it respects their “red line” of maintaining the Trump-era tax cuts. Biden had previously proposed raising the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%, but Republicans had strongly objected to that because it would undo one of the crucial parts of the Trump tax cuts. Psaki said Biden plans to speak again to Republican Senator Shelley Moore Capito over the phone tomorrow to continue the infrastructure negotiations. The White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, is now holding her daily briefing with reporters. She opened the briefing by discussing the recent ransomware attacks on major companies like JBS and Colonial Pipeline. Psaki emphasized that private companies have a “responsibility to strengthen their cyber-defense to protect the American public and our economy”. “We can’t do it alone,” Psaki said of the federal government’s efforts to prevent cyberattacks. CDC director Dr Rochelle Walensky has given promising news on the coronavirus pandemic in the US at Thursday’s coronavirus briefing. CDC data indicate that just over 9,300 new cases have been recorded for 1 June, making the seven-day average approximately 15,000 new cases—a more than 30pct decline from the prior seven-day average, Walensky says. That’s also a 94 pct drop from the peak in January. While the seven-day average for new hospital admissions is approximately 2,750, that is an 83 pct decline from January’s peak. The seven-day average of daily deaths is 363, a decrease of more than 16 percent from the prior seven-day average. Walensky has urged adolescents and teens aged 12 through 15 years to get the jab. Officials said in May that this age group could receive the vaccine. In the month prior to the age group receiving access to the vaccine, the CDC “observed troubling data regarding the hospitalization of adolescents with Covid-19,” Walensky says. “More concerning,” Walensky says, are data on adolescents with Covid-19 in intensive care units at hospitals, on mechanical ventilators. Walensky says CDC is publishing a report on Friday with more details on severe disease among youth. Lara Trump, the former president’s daughter-in-law, on Thursday seemed to reject media reports that Donald Trump told associates that he expected to be reinstated by autumn. “As far as I know, there are no plans for Donald Trump to be in the White House in August,” she commented in a Fox &amp; Friends interview. “Maybe there’s something I don’t know...but no, I think that that is a lot of folks getting a little worked up about something just because maybe there wasn’t enough pushback, you know, from the Republican side.” “So no, I have not heard any plans for Donald Trump to be installed in the White House in August.” These apparent denials stem from The New York Times’ Washington DC correspondent Maggie Haberman’s reporting that Trump “has been telling a number of people he’s in contact with that he expects he will get reinstated by August.” This reporting comes amid Trump’s continued peddling of false election fraud claims, and his insistence that the 2020 election was stolen from him. Politico points out that Lara Trump’s comments also come as Democrats, as well as some Republicans, are increasingly worried about Trump allies’ continued litigation of the 2020 Election in an attempt to reverse Joe Biden’s win. In detailing the White House’s plans to share 80m covid-19 vaccines, US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan has said Thursday that “this is only the beginning.” Biden, Sullivan says, has committed to sharing doses “on an ongoing basis” and that “we will continue to donate from our excess supply as that supply is delivered to us.” Biden’s coronavirus coordinator Jeff Zients has explained that the 80m doses comprise 13pct of the total coronavirus vaccine doses produced in the US. The US’s approach to ramping up global vaccine distribution is three-pronged, Zients says. In addition to ongoing donations, the administration will work with US vaccine manufacturers to ramp up domestic production. The administration also plans to work with “partner nations,” pharmaceutical companies, and other manufacturers to enable vaccine production across the globe, to “not only beat this pandemic, but also [prepare] the world to respond to other future threats,” Zients says. President Joe Biden has provided additional details on his administration’s plan to share 80m Covid-19 vaccine doses with other countries, explaining Thursday how the first 25m doses will be disbursed. Around seven million doses will go to Latin America and the Caribbean, some seven million will go to South and Southeast Asia, and approximately five million will go to Africa, Biden has said in a statement. Those 19m doses will be shared through Covax, the global vaccine-sharing initiative. The remainder, about six million doses, will be shared directly with countries seeing surges, and nations in crisis, as well as other allies and neighbors, including Canada, Mexico, India, and the Republic of Korea, Biden says in the statement. The US has already shared more than four million doses with Mexico and Canada. Biden has said in May that he hopes to share 80m doses with other countries by the end of June. “As the United States continues our efforts to get every eligible American vaccinated and fight COVID-19 here at home, we also recognize that ending this pandemic means ending it everywhere. As long as this pandemic is raging anywhere in the world, the American people will still be vulnerable. And the United States is committed to bringing the same urgency to international vaccination efforts that we have demonstrated at home,” his statement says. “We are sharing these doses not to secure favors or extract concessions. We are sharing these vaccines to save lives and to lead the world in bringing an end to the pandemic, with the power of our example and with our values.” Joe Biden outlined a new proposal for how to pay for an infrastructure bill in his meeting with Shelley Moore Capito yesterday, according to a new report. The Washington Post reports: Biden’s new offer amounted a major concession after Republicans said his earlier proposal to lift the corporate tax rate from 21 percent to 28 percent — a move that would unwind the tax cuts the GOP adopted in 2017 — amounted to a nonstarter. Instead, Biden on Wednesday recommended a new, minimum corporate tax of 15 percent, seeking to take aim at dozens of profitable U.S. corporations that pay little to nothing to the federal government annually, according to a person familiar with the talks who requested anonymity to describe them. The White House also proposed stepping up enforcement on corporations and wealthy earners who rely on loopholes to lessen their tax burdens, the person said. The offer marked an attempt by the White House to avert the ‘red line’ that Republicans laid down earlier in negotiations over infrastructure reform, though the source maintained that Biden has not strayed in his overall belief in raising rates on both corporations and wealthy individual earners. Biden’s new offer could help reinvigorate the infrastructure negotiations, which seemed to be approaching a standstill as the president and Republicans continued to disagree over the scope of the package. Joe Biden’s meeting with Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Brussels this month will mark the US president’s first in-person conversation with the Turkish leader since he took office in January. Erdogan warned this week that the US risks losing a “precious friend” if the Biden administration attempts to corner Turkey. Erdogan’s warning came more than a month after Biden became the first US president to recognize the genocide of Armenians by the Ottoman Empire, a move that outraged Turkey. After the G-7 summit in Cornwall, Joe Biden will travel to Brussels, Belgium, to participate in the NATO Summit on June 14. At the summit, Biden will hold a one-on-one meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to “discuss the full range of bilateral and regional issues,” the White House said in its new statement about the president’s travel plans. Biden will also participate in the US-EU summit in Brussels before traveling on to Geneva, Switzerland, where he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The White House said Biden will sit down with Swiss President Guy Parmelin and Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis as well while in Geneva. The White House has just released a statement confirming that Joe Biden will meet with Queen Elizabeth when he travels to the UK for the G-7 summit this month. In the statement, press secretary Jen Psaki also noted that Biden will meet with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson the day before the summit starts in Cornwall. “President Biden will meet British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on June 10 to affirm the enduring strength of the special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom,” Psaki said. “On June 13, the President and Dr. Biden will meet Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth at Windsor Castle. Dr. Biden will return to the United States following this meeting.” Joe Biden’s trip to the UK for the G-7 summit and his meeting with Queen Elizabeth will mark his first trip abroad since becoming president in January. It will also be the queen’s first meeting with a major foreign leader since her husband, Prince Philip, died in April. The US president and first lady offered their condolences to the queen and the rest of the royal family after Philip’s death. “On behalf of all the people of the United States, we send our deepest condolences to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, the entire Royal Family, and all the people of the United Kingdom on the death of His Royal Highness Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh,” the president said in a statement. “Jill and I are keeping the Queen and to Prince Philip’s children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren in our hearts during this time.” Since the start of her reign in 1952, Queen Elizabeth has met with every US president, except Lyndon Johnson. Donald Trump visited the queen in June 2019, and the then-president raved about meeting with the monarch, even though his trip was tinged with controversy because of his criticism of the London mayor, Sadiq Khan. Shortly after the meeting, Trump bragged to Fox News anchor Laura Ingraham that he had developed a true rapport with the queen. “There are those that say they have never seen the queen have a better time, a more animated time,” Trump told Ingraham. “We just had a great time.” Joe Biden will meet with Queen Elizabeth when he travels to the UK for the G-7 summit in Cornwall this month, Buckingham Palace announced this morning. The announcement indicated the US president and first lady will meet with the queen on Sunday, June 13. The summit is taking place from June 11 to 13. The White House has not yet confirmed Biden’s plans, but earlier reports indicated administration officials were speaking to the queen’s team to make the meeting happen. Biden’s visit will mark the queen’s first meeting with a major foreign leader since her husband, Prince Philip, died in April. Hugo Lowell reports for the Guardian: Top Democrats are making a renewed effort to press ahead with establishing a sweeping, central investigation into the 6 January attack on the Capitol in what could be the final opportunity to hold former US president Donald Trump to account for inciting insurrection. The move reflects the resolve of the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, to pursue a comprehensive inquiry even without bipartisan support, after Senate Republicans, fearful of what a full accounting of the violence might uncover, last week voted down legislation for a 9/11-style commission to scrutinize the attack by a pro-Trump mob. Pelosi said on a Democratic caucus call on Tuesday that she was prepared to create a House select committee with subpoena power to replace the commission as the principal investigation by Congress into the assault, according to sources familiar with the matter. The select committee was one of several options raised on the call that included empowering one existing committee, such as the House homeland security committee, to take charge of the congressional investigation, the sources said. Pelosi did not endorse any particular proposal, but she did categorically rule out a presidential commission created by Joe Biden, in large part because such a panel would lack subpoena authority or funding without a statutory change. New claims for jobless benefits hit a new pandemic-era low in the US last week, marking the fifth consecutive week that the number has declined, according to new data released this morning. The AP reports: The Labor Department said Thursday that jobless claims dropped to 385,000, down 20,000 from the week before. The number of weekly applications for unemployment aid, which generally reflects the pace of layoffs, has fallen steadily all year, though it remains high by historical standards. The decline in applications reflects a swift rebound in economic growth and the job market’s steady recovery from the coronavirus recession. More Americans are venturing out to shop, travel, dine out and congregate at entertainment venues. All that renewed spending has led companies to seek new workers. Employers have added 1.8 million jobs this year — an average of more than 450,000 a month — and the government’s May jobs report on Friday is expected to show that they added an additional 656,000 last month, according to a survey of economists by the data firm FactSet. The economy remains down 8.2 million jobs from its level in February 2020, just before the virus tore through the economy. Joe Biden has credited his American Rescue Plan with helping to reinvigorate the US economy, while Republicans have insisted the recovery is thanks to policies signed into law by Donald Trump. Touting the country’s economic progress, Biden said in Ohio last week, “Covid cases are down, Covid deaths are down, unemployment filings are down, hunger is down, vaccinations are up, jobs are up, growth is up, people gaining health coverage is up, small business confidence is up. Put it simply: America is coming back. America is on the move.” Greetings from Washington, live blog readers. Joe Biden met yesterday with the Republican senator who is leading the party’s infrastructure team, but it does not seem like the two reached any kind of agreement on a bipartisan bill. In a readout of the meeting, the White House said Biden and Senator Shelley Moore Capito had “a constructive and frank conversation in the Oval Office about how we can drive economic growth and benefit America’s middle class through investing in our infrastructure”. Biden and Capito are expected to speak again tomorrow. However, reports indicate that the meeting was not as “constructive” as the White House claimed, and Republicans are even considering presenting a separate proposal to Biden’s team. Politico reports: Capito briefed the other five Senate Republicans in her negotiating group — JOHN BARRASSO (Wyo.), ROY BLUNT (Mo.), MIKE CRAPO (Idaho), PAT TOOMEY (Pa.) and ROGER WICKER (Miss.) — on Wednesday night. Per three people familiar, Biden wants $1 trillion in new spending and is sticking to his guns on corporate tax hikes being part of the pay-fors. ... Republicans weren’t happy, to say the least. Biden, they have said publicly, told them just a few weeks ago in an Oval Office meeting that baseline spending — i.e., money that would be spent under current policy — could be included in the total. In their latest $928 billion infrastructure proposal, they had put forward only $257 billion in new spending, while the White House’s last number was $1.7 trillion. The GOP is considering another counteroffer that could come as soon as Friday, when Capito will be talking to Biden again, this time likely by phone. It’s unclear what that would look like — or even whether Republicans will make a new proposal. On Wednesday night’s call, no final decision was made about another offer, particularly because some Republicans in the group are starting to feel discouraged. As multiple options emerge in the infrastructure talks, one thing is clear: time is running out to reach a bipartisan deal. Biden has said he wants the negotiations to wrap up soon, and there is still no sign of a final agreement in sight. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned.","charCount":"29665","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/joan-greve\">Joan E Greve</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2021/jun/03/covid-lockdown-support-disaster-payment-national-lockdown-framework-australia-commonwealth-victoria-melbourne","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-03T20:19:54Z","webTitle":"Two ‘fleeting’ Melbourne Covid cases declared false positives as disaster payments announced","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/jun/03/covid-lockdown-support-disaster-payment-national-lockdown-framework-australia-commonwealth-victoria-melbourne","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2021/jun/03/covid-lockdown-support-disaster-payment-national-lockdown-framework-australia-commonwealth-victoria-melbourne","fields":{"headline":"Two ‘fleeting’ Melbourne Covid cases declared false positives as disaster payments announced","standfirst":"<p>Payments of up to $500 announced as Victorian health department reveals two cases previously linked to cluster were false positives</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/jun/02/melbourne-lockdown-covid-victoria-restrictions-coronavirus-rules-covid19-explained-5km-radius-masks-compulsory-exercising-home-gatherings-what-you-need-to-know\">Victoria’s Covid lockdown restrictions explained</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/jun/02/covid-19-list-melbourne-public-exposure-sites-hotspots-victoria-venues-case-location-alerts-metro-regional-vic-coronavirus-cases-outbreak-locations\">Victoria case alerts and exposure sites</a>; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/02/covid-19-list-nsw-public-exposure-sites-hotspots-goulburn-jervis-bay-hyams-beach-venues-case-location-alerts-sydney-regional-coronavirus-cases-outbreak-locations\">NSW exposure sites</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/datablog/ng-interactive/2021/may/31/covid-19-vaccine-rollout-australia-coronavirus-vaccination-progress-updates-tracker-victoria-nsw-queensland-qld-daily-live-data-stats-updates-total-numbers-distribution-schedule-tracking-new-cases-today\">Vaccine rollout numbers: tracking vaccination progress</a></li></ul>","trailText":"Payments of up to $500 announced as Victorian health department reveals two cases previously linked to cluster were false positives<br>","byline":"Josh Taylor and Sarah Martin","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aa6569de45dfb60565ebe4ad552d3f7979fbad6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa6569de45dfb60565ebe4ad552d3f7979fbad6e/0_173_4800_2878/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chairs stacked up outside a closed restaurant\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scott Morrison says national cabinet will discuss on Friday which level of government will pay for a new Covid disaster payment for workers in lockdown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: William West/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Two suspected “fleeting” transmission cases of coronavirus that were part of the reason for Melbourne’s lockdown extension have been declared false positives.</p> <p>Health authorities initially thought a woman caught Covid-19 at a Metricon display home at Mickleham, and believed a man similarly picked up the virus at Brighton Beach Hotel.</p> <p>That was not the case, with an expert panel review confirming neither was even infected.</p> <p>The news came on late on Thursday, after it was revealed workers in Melbourne who have not had shifts due to the extended Covid lockdown will be eligible for up to $500 in support after the prime minister announced a new temporary Covid disaster payment.</p> <p>Scott Morrison said on Thursday the disaster payment would be available in areas declared a commonwealth hotspot when any lockdown lasted longer than seven days.</p> <p>A $500 weekly payment will be available for people who work more than 20 hours a week, while $325 will be available for those who work less than that.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/jun/03/critical-lack-of-covid-vaccine-supply-in-melbourne-forcing-gps-to-turn-people-away\">‘Critical’ lack of Covid vaccine supply in Melbourne forcing GPs to turn people away</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Separately, the federal and Victorian governments are close to reaching an agreement over a new quarantine centre to be built at Avalon.</p> <p>A memorandum of understanding has been sent from Canberra to Melbourne and it is expected an agreement will be finalised on Friday to coincide with a meeting of national cabinet.

Health authorities initially thought a woman caught Covid-19 at a Metricon display home at Mickleham, and believed a man similarly picked up the virus at Brighton Beach Hotel. That was not the case, with an expert panel review confirming neither was even infected. The news came on late on Thursday, after it was revealed workers in Melbourne who have not had shifts due to the extended Covid lockdown will be eligible for up to $500 in support after the prime minister announced a new temporary Covid disaster payment. Scott Morrison said on Thursday the disaster payment would be available in areas declared a commonwealth hotspot when any lockdown lasted longer than seven days. A $500 weekly payment will be available for people who work more than 20 hours a week, while $325 will be available for those who work less than that. Separately, the federal and Victorian governments are close to reaching an agreement over a new quarantine centre to be built at Avalon. A memorandum of understanding has been sent from Canberra to Melbourne and it is expected an agreement will be finalised on Friday to coincide with a meeting of national cabinet. Federal government sources have said while it is not a done deal yet, it is very close. The Covid-free pair and their primary close contacts will be released from isolation and any associated exposure sites stood down, including all in Anglesea along the Great Ocean Road. The Metricon display home and Brighton Beach Hotel remain linked to other confirmed cases and will remain exposure sites. Victoria’s health department explained authorities always enact immediate health measures for every positive case. “These cases will be reclassified and no longer considered confirmed cases,” the health department said. The disaster payment announced on Thursday will only go to people older than 17, who were working before the lockdown and who can no longer work. They will need to have less than $10,000 in savings. There are further restrictions including whether other leave – beyond annual and sick leave – is available to cover the lockdown period. People already receiving income or business support, or the pandemic leave disaster payment, will not be eligible either. Applications for workers in Melbourne will open on Tuesday through Services Australia. The payment will not be available to regional Victorians, however, as their lockdown will only last one week. The acting premier, James Merlino, announced on Wednesday that areas outside greater Melbourne would come out of lockdown at midnight on Thursday. The state’s capital city will remain locked down until midnight on 10 June at this stage. There were three new local Covid cases in Melbourne officially reported on Thursday including a previously announced case in the Arcare Maidstone aged care facility. Victoria’s deputy chief health officer, Prof Allen Cheng, said the two additional cases were a staff member from a Port Melbourne workplace and a child of a previously identified case in Whittlesea. All three cases were in isolation for their entire infectious period, meaning there were no new exposure sites on Thursday. Morrison said which level of government would fund the new disaster payment would be discussed at national cabinet on Friday. He said two options were on the table: first, for the state government to pay for business support, as Victoria has done, and the commonwealth to fund individual income support; or alternatively, for the federal and state governments to split the total cost. Speaking before the PM’s announcement, Merlino said his preference was for the state to cover business support and the commonwealth to handle income support. “The state responsibility is supporting Victorian businesses and we have done that with almost half a billion [dollars] of support and we will provide further support,” he said. “The federal government [should provide] income support for workers, that is solely their responsibility, and it would be disappointing if they walked away from that.” The federal treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, said the Treasury and finance department were working to cost the temporary Covid disaster payment. It’s estimated for every 100,000 people it could cost $50m a week, and with half a million casuals in Melbourne, the cost could be $250m just for the next seven days. Cheng said Victoria was reviewing case numbers every day. It was too early to say if the lockdown in Melbourne would end before 10 June, he said. Victoria administered 23,192 doses of Covid vaccines on Wednesday and Cheng said the surge had strained supplies of the Pfizer vaccine. “There is a constraint on the Pfizer vaccines in Victoria,” he said. “If we had more, we would give more, but there is a supply chain. It comes from the commonwealth and that comes from overseas and we are making do with what we have at the moment.” Morrison said Victoria received 71,000 Pfizer doses of the additional 130,000 made available last week and more could be made available to support requests from the Victorian government. The prime minister said the federal government respected the decisions of state and territory governments to introduce restrictions based on health advice. But he repeatedly stated the virus should not be feared. “Resilience, strength, character, determination. That is what beats a virus, never fear,” Morrison told reporters in Canberra. Merlino said Victoria didn’t want to go into lockdown but followed the health advice, which was based on just 2% of the population being fully vaccinated. “The only way out of this pandemic is the successful rollout of the vaccine. The virus is our enemy and the virus doesn’t sleep. The virus mutates – the virus thinks that this is a race.”","charCount":"5901","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/josh-taylor\">Josh Taylor</a> and <a href=\"profile/sarah-martin\">Sarah Martin</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2021/jun/03/india-covid-variant-spreading-in-englands-schools-and-colleges-data-shows","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-03T20:05:01Z","webTitle":"India Covid variant spreading in England’s schools, data shows","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/jun/03/india-covid-variant-spreading-in-englands-schools-and-colleges-data-shows","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2021/jun/03/india-covid-variant-spreading-in-englands-schools-and-colleges-data-shows","fields":{"headline":"India Covid variant spreading in England’s schools, data shows","standfirst":"<p>Public Health England figures show the number of Delta variant infections in schools and colleges rose sharply in May</p>","trailText":"Public Health England figures show the number of Delta variant infections in schools and colleges rose sharply in May","byline":"Richard Adams and Nicola Davis","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a41f0309b478ed9925364dbcd873cd0b69bec6f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a41f0309b478ed9925364dbcd873cd0b69bec6f/0_0_4266_2560/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Experts say the figures from Public Health England show schools were now a ‘major source’ of transmission. \" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Experts say the figures from Public Health England show schools were now a ‘major source’ of transmission. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Lopeman/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>The Delta Covid-19 variant has begun spreading in schools and colleges throughout England, it has been revealed, after Public Health England published new data on outbreaks of the variant that teachers and staff unions have demanded.</p> <p>The new data covering 26 April to 30 May showed the number of Delta variant infections in schools or other educational setting rising rapidly throughout the period, with a total of 140 incidents until the start of June.</p> <p>Prof Christina Pagel, director of University College London’s clinical operational research unit, said the figures were evidence that schools were now “a major source” of transmission, after the government last month dropped its requirement for secondary school pupils to wear masks in classrooms.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/may/07/pupils-should-keep-wearing-masks-into-the-summer-sage-told-ministers\">Pupils should keep wearing masks into the summer, Sage told ministers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Dr William Welfare, deputy director of health protection at Public Health England (PHE) said that while outbreaks in schools are at low levels, “we have seen a slight increase over recent weeks,” in line with the higher levels of variants being detected in the community.</p> <p>“The latest PHE data suggest that there have been 97 confirmed Covid-19 outbreaks in primary and secondary schools that have had at least one variant case linked to them over the most recent four-week period.

Diplomacy or philanthropy, one would ask.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The US will donate 75% of its unused Covid-19 vaccines to the UN-backed Covax global vaccine sharing program, President Joe Biden announced Thursday as more Americans have been vaccinated and global inequities have become more glaring.</p> <p>The White House unveiled the allocation for sharing a first 25 million doses with the world, part of its plans to share 80 million globally by the end of June. The administration says 25% will be kept in reserve for emergencies and for the US to share directly with allies and partners.</p> <p>“As long as this pandemic is raging anywhere in the world, the American people will still be vulnerable,” Biden said in a statement. “And the United States is committed to bringing the same urgency to international vaccination efforts that we have demonstrated at home.”</p> <p>Of the first tranche of 25 million doses, the White House says about 19 million will go to Covax, with approximately 6 million for South and Central America, 7 million for Asia, and 5 million for Africa. The doses mark a substantial — and immediate — boost to the lagging Covax effort, which to date has shared just 76 million doses with needy countries.</p> <p>US national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the US “will retain the say in terms of where” the doses distributed through Covax ultimately go. “We’re not seeking to extract concessions, we’re not extorting, we’re not imposing conditions the way that other countries who are providing doses are doing; we’re doing none of those things,” said Sullivan. “These are doses that are being given, donated free and clear to these countries, for the sole purpose of improving the public health situation and helping end the pandemic.”</p> <p>The remaining 6 million will be directed by the White House to US allies and partners, including Mexico, Canada, and the Republic of Korea, West Bank and Gaza, India, Ukraine, Kosovo, Haiti, Georgia, Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, and Yemen, as well as for United Nations frontline workers.</p> <p>The long-awaited vaccine sharing plan comes as demand for shots in the U.S. has dropped significantly — more than 63% of adults have received at least one dose — and as global inequities in supply have become more glaring.</p> <p>Scores of countries have requested doses from the United States, but to date only Mexico and Canada have received a combined 4.5 million doses.

Before they settle down with a stable partner, their sex life is largely made up of multiple short-term relationships and no condoms.”<br></p> <p>Norway, a country of 5.4 million, is among the countries least affected by Covid-19, with 125,881 cases and 785 deaths.

A lot of people with hopes of a holiday or visiting loved ones abroad will have their eye closely on the situation – we might get that news around 11am this morning.</p> <p>Getting there may prove more of a headache than usual, as AFP report. A year after the coronavirus pandemic emptied airports, air travel associations fear chaos during Europe’s summer holiday season as travellers could wait hours before boarding planes due to health checks.</p> <p>Strict controls are still in place at most European airports even though vaccination campaigns are making progress and infection rates are falling.</p> <p>The International Air Transport Association (IATA) reported last week that on average, people travelling at peak times now stay twice as long at airports - three hours - compared with 2019.</p> <p>That time is generally spent checking in, passing security and immigration controls, picking up checked bags and making it through customs. And there’s the new reality: Airlines having to check passengers’ Covid tests, temperature and other health documents.</p> <p>The wait time has increased even though the volume of traffic is “only about 30 percent of pre-Covid-19 levels”, an IATA statement said.</p> <p>The sector lobby group warned that time spent in airports could swell to five hours and 30 minutes if traffic rebounds to 75 percent of its pre-pandemic level, and even longer “without process improvements”.</p> <p>The EU Digital Covid Certificate - showing whether a traveller was vaccinated, has immunity from a previous infection or passed a coronavirus test - will be rolled out on 1 July in an effort to make travel smoother within the 27-nation bloc.</p> <p>“The level of both uncertainty and complexity in planning for the restart is just mind blowing for now,” said the director general of the European branch of Airports Control International, Olivier Jankovec. His association represents 500 airports on the continent.</p> <p>“With each passing day, the prospect of travellers enduring widespread chaos at airports this summer is becoming more real.”</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-06-03T07:37:36.006Z\">at 8.37am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-60b881cf8f082e80569f4b23\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-03T07:17:07.855Z\">8.17am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Indonesia</strong> has cancelled the haj pilgrimage for people in the world’s largest Muslim-majority nation for a second year in a row due to concerns over the pandemic, the religious affairs minister said this morning.<br></p> <p>Reuters report that minister Yaqut Cholil Qoumas told a briefing that Saudi Arabia, where the pilgrimage takes place, had not opened access to the haj.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60b87f088f08b9889b367642\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-03T07:07:55.130Z\">8.07am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">UK government 'shortchanging children' in England on catch-up plans – Labour spokesperson</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In the UK, Labour’s opposition spokesperson <strong>James Murray</strong> has also been trailing round the TV and radio studios.

And so a lot of us have been talking about a 100-day target from the recognition from a virus with pandemic potential.”<br></p> <p>“It would mean that we would have had a vaccine in early April if that had happened this time, early April of 2020,” Lander said. “It makes you gulp for a second, but it’s totally feasible to do that.”</p> <p>He is the first director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy to be promoted to Cabinet level in a US administration.

In some areas local political leaders have retreated from public engagement on the issue, while in others, including Tuskegee, local leadership has played a vital role in pushing rates above the state average.</p> <p>Omar Neal, a local radio host and community leader, took his shot almost as soon as it was available. He weighed the heavy history but set aside what he described as instinctive distrust of public health systems after generations of failures.</p> <p>“Trust is a calculated risk,” he said, pausing for a moment. “Five hundred and eighty-eight thousand people have died because they didn’t get this vaccine.

I must say that I was one of those very sceptical about the Wuhan lab leak theory initially, as much of the evidence posted online that I saw seemed to amount to not much more than “They have a lab there, you know”.</p> <p>Former MI6 chief <strong>Sir Richard Dearlove</strong> possibly knows his onions a bit better than me, and he’s had some pretty stringent words about the origins of the virus on a podcast from the Telegraph, and PA have picked up the quotes this morning. He says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The People’s Republic of China is a pretty terrifying regime and does some things we consider unacceptable and extreme in silencing opposition to the official line of the government. We don’t know that’s what’s happened, but a lot of data have probably been destroyed or made to disappear so it’s going to be difficult to prove definitely the case for a ‘gain of function chimera’ being the cause of the pandemic.</p> </blockquote> <p>Trevor Marshallsea writes that Sir Richard said he felt some vindication as more people were beginning to take seriously his repeated questioning of the origins of the coronavirus. He spoke of “extraordinary behaviour” in the scientific community which had “shut down any debate” and which he said verged on “academic bullying”.</p> <p>China, he said, had originally been “let off the hook” on questions about the virus’s origins due to scepticism over the Trump administration, which had led such enquiries initially.</p> <p>He also said the West had been naive in trusting China, which had infiltrated scientific institutions and journals in the UK and elsewhere.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60b86ea28f082ac930ae8b9a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-03T05:55:57.349Z\">6.55am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The latest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2021/jun/03/the-wuhan-lab-leak-theory-podcast\">episode</a> of the Guardian’s Today In Focus podcast is exploring the Wuhan lab leak theory.</p> <p>When Covid-19 first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan, much of the focus of the initial investigation fell on a seafood market that also sold exotic animals for human consumption. But in the months since, no definitive link has been proven and the precise origin story remains unsolved.</p> <p>In the intervening period numerous conspiracy theories have spread: that somehow 5G phone signals could be involved, or that the virus is a hoax. Bracketed in with these was a theory that Covid-19 may have been released (accidentally or otherwise) from a lab.</p> <p>Initially scientists poured scorn on the lab leak theory but in recent months suspicion has fallen on the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which studies coronaviruses. As the Guardian’s <strong>Peter Beaumont </strong>tells <strong>Anushka Asthana</strong>,<strong> </strong>these suspicions are still being treated with scepticism by scientists. But now, in the absence of any other confirmed origin, Joe Biden has asked US intelligence agencies to consider the lab leak theory as a possibility and to investigate.

There were 18 deaths reported within 28 days of a positive test. France’s seven-day moving average of daily Covid-19 deaths fell below 100 for the first time since October 27th, official figures show. The Covid-19 death toll increased by 70 to 109,828, the eighth-highest total globally, Reuters reports. The seven-day moving average stood at 95 versus 105 on Wednesday. John Hopkins university confirmed that more than two billion vaccine doses have been distributed worldwide, with Israel remaining the country with the most vaccinated – as nearly six-in-10 people are fully inoculated against Covid. Italy opened vaccinations for everybody over the age of 12, after the European Medicines Agency approved the Pfizer/BioNTech jab for 12 to 15-year-olds last week. The US is to donate 75% of its unused Covid-19 vaccines to the UN-backed Covax global vaccine sharing program, president Joe Biden announced as more Americans have been vaccinated and global inequities have become more glaring. The heads of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank also urged the G7 advanced economies to release any excess Covid-19 vaccines to developing countries as soon as possible, and called on manufacturers to ramp up production. India placed an order for 300m doses of an as-yet unapproved coronavirus vaccine, a day after its Supreme Court criticised the government for bungling the country’s vaccination programme. The potential Covid treatment based on a cocktail of monoclonal antibodies developed by US drugmaker Regeneron and Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche was purchased by the EU to the tune of about 55,000 doses. The US embassy ‘strongly suggested that US citizens make plans to leave Afghanistan as soon as possible’ amid spiking reported Covid cases and US citizens reportedly being denied admittance because of a lack of beds, with other concerns unrelated to the virus in the country also growing. Portugal was removed from the UK government’s “green list” of destinations from which people can return to England without having to quarantine, and no extra countries have been added, sparking industry fury. The head of a Pakistani province decreed that government employees who refuse to be vaccinated against Covid would not be paid from next month. A cruise ship arrived in Venice, Italy, for the first time in 17 months, signalling the return of tourists after the pandemic but enraging those who decry the impact of the giant floating hotels on the world heritage site. Airline Jet2 has delayed the restart of flights and holidays from June 24 to July 1, following the UK government changes to travel lists. Jet2 said that flights to Turkey, which remains on the “red” list, would not restart until July 22, PA reports. Portugal including the islands of Madeira and the Azores, will be removed from the green list exempting the need for travellers from the UK to quarantine on return from 4am on Tuesday. Sri Lanka, Egypt, Afghanistan, Bahrain, Costa Rica, Sudan, and Trinidad and Tobago will also be placed on the red list, meaning people arriving in the UK from those nations will be required to stay in a quarantine hotel for 11 nights. The heads of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank have welcomed US plans to distribute the first 25 million of 80 million vaccine doses that Washington has pledged to share globally by the end of this month. “It’s a good start, and I am hoping that more doses will be made available, especially for countries with deployment programs,” World Bank president David Malpass told Reuters. Malpass and IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva will meet in person on Friday and Saturday with finance officials from the G7 countries - Britain, the US, Canada, Germany, Italy, France and Japan. Democratic Republic of Congo is facing a third wave of coronavirus infections with its epicentre in the capital Kinshasa, health minister Jean-Jacques Mbungani said. Authorities are concerned about a recent spike in infections that saw 243 new cases recorded on Wednesday, the highest daily figure since March, Reuters reports. “I officially announce the onset of the third wave of the Covid-10 pandemic in our country, with Kinshasa as its epicentre,” Mbungani told reporters. A low vaccination rate and haphazard observance of recommended hygiene practices were among the reasons for the rising infection rate, he said. On Wednesday, the World Health Organization said it was concerned about the spread in Kinshasa of the Delta variant first identified in India. The US has told India about its plans to make Covid-19 vaccines available to other countries, including the South Asian nation, prime minister Narendra Modi’s office said. The move comes after the White House laid out a plan to share 25 million surplus vaccine doses with the world and said it would lift some restrictions to allow other countries to buy American-made supplies for vaccine production more easily, Reuters reports. In a phone call on Thursday, Modi and US vice president Kamala Harris discussed efforts to improve the bilateral health supply chain, including in vaccine production, the Indian premier’s office said in a statement. “They highlighted the potential of the India-US partnership as well as the Quad vaccine initiative in addressing the long-term health impact of the pandemic.” Chile’s health ministry said it would raise the minimum age of men approved to receive the AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine to 45, from 18, until authorities complete an investigation into a young man who had a blood clot after his first shot. The country received its first doses of the AstraZeneca-Oxford University vaccine in April. Regulators initially approved the vaccine for men over 18 and women over 45, Reuters reports. Authorities said a case of thrombosis in a 31-year man prompted them to increase the minimum age, calling it a “preventive and proactive measure”. Dr Jeff Barrett, director of the Covid-19 Genomics Initiative at the Wellcome Sanger Institute in the UK, said the Nepal mutation first detected in India has also been observed in other variants including the one first identified in South Africa. He said it “is believed to be part of why that variant (South African) is less well neutralised by vaccines”. Dr Barrett added that because of this possibility and because the Indian variant appears more transmissible than the variant first detected in South Africa, scientists are monitoring it carefully, PA reports. He explained this Indian variant plus the mutation has been seen in numerous countries, including the UK, Portugal, the USA, India, Nepal and Japan. France’s seven-day moving average of daily Covid-19 deaths fell below 100 for the first time since October 27th, official figures show. The Covid-19 death toll increased by 70 to 109,828, the eighth-highest total globally, Reuters reports. The seven-day moving average stood at 95 versus 105 on Wednesday. French health authorities reported 8,161 new confirmed cases over 24 hours, taking the total to 5.69 million, the world’s fourth-highest total. The daily total has now stayed below 10,000 for a fifth straight day, a sequence unseen since early September, and the seven-day moving average of daily new cases fell below 9,000 for the first time since September at 8,350. The UK death toll is now at 127,812 after a further 18 people had died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19 as of Thursday. Separate figures published by the Office for National Statistics show there have now been 153,000 deaths registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate. A total of 39,758,428 people have received a first dose of Covid-19 vaccine, with half the adult population having received two doses. Guatemala’s President Alejandro Giammattei said the US will supply half a million Covid-19 doses to the Central American country, Reuters reports. Under pressure from the international community to share a surplus of vaccines, US president Joe Biden had laid out earlier how his country would share some 25 million of a planned 80 million doses with the rest of the world. “We were just told that the government of the United States will work with us and send half a million vaccines,” Giammattei said. John Hopkins university confirmed that more than two billion vaccine doses have been distributed worldwide, with Israel remaining the country with the most vaccinated – as nearly six-in-10 people are fully inoculated against Covid.

The UK has recorded 5,274 new cases - the highest daily figure since March. There were 18 deaths reported within 28 days of a positive test. Airlines and travel firms have reacted with dismay to the latest UK government guidance on foreign holidays, saying it has “failed on a promise” to the industry to provide greater notice on its directives. PA has the story: Many were angry at the lack of consultation and said it risked the summer being ruined for the struggling sector. John Holland-Kaye, boss of Heathrow, the UK’s largest airport, said: “Ministers spent last month hailing the restart of international travel, only to close it down three weeks later all but guaranteeing another lost summer for the travel sector. “Everyone wants to protect public health, but the entire point of the ‘global travel taskforce’ was to establish a system to unlock low-risk travel safely. Britain is the worst performing economy in the G7, and in the week that the prime minister hosts G7 leaders to launch his government’s vision of ‘global Britain’, he’s sending a message that the UK will remain isolated from the rest of the world and closed to most of its G7 partners.” Package holiday firm TUI UK was equally scathing, claiming the government broke promises to the industry. Andrew Flintham, managing director for TUI UK, said: “This latest announcement is another step back for our industry. After promises that the ‘global travel taskforce’ would result in a clear framework, removing the damaging flip flopping we all endured last summer, the Government decision to move Portugal straight from green to amber will do untold damage to customer confidence. “We were reassured that a green watch list would be created and a weeks’ notice would be given so travellers wouldn’t have to rush back home. They have failed on this promise.” The coronavirus variant of concern first discovered in India, known as Delta, is more likely to lead to hospitalisations that the Alpha variant first detected in Kent, data suggests, raising further concerns about its spread across the UK. The New York Times reports that Afghan and US officials have warned of spiking reported Covid cases in Afghanistan after the health ministry declared the country was in the midst of a third wave of the pandemic. It cites a health ministry report that hospitals are swiftly reaching occupancy with Covid patients and that some health centres are running out of oxygen. The US embassy said some of its citizens reported being denied admittance because of a lack of beds. “The US embassy strongly suggests that US citizens make plans to leave Afghanistan as soon as possible,” the American mission said in a statement today. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a Level 4 Travel Health Notice and the Department of State has issued a Level 4 Travel Advisory advising against all travel to Kabul due [to] Covid-19, crime, terrorism, civil unrest, kidnapping, and armed conflict. Commercial flight options from Hamid Karzai International Airport (HKIA) remain available and the US Embassy strongly suggests that U.S. citizens make plans to leave Afghanistan as soon as possible. Given the security conditions and reduced staffing, the embassy’s ability to assist US citizens in Afghanistan is extremely limited. In its daily coronavirus report, the Afghan health ministry said the rate of positive tests rose sharply yesterday to 34%, the NYT reported. Acting minister of public health Wahid Majrooh said this week that rising rates of infection had forced authorities to open another hospital for Covid patients in Kabul, but that many more facilities were needed. “Lack of oxygen is becoming a serious problem,” he said today, according to the paper. “We are quickly approaching a critical phase of the coronavirus.” UK prime minister Boris Johnson has received his second dose of the AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine. He got his jab at the Francis Crick Institute in central London this evening. Johnson received his first dose of the Astra Zeneca/Oxford vaccine at St Thomas’ Hospital in March. He spent several days in intensive care at the same hospital after contracting Covid-19 in Spring 2020. Here’s the full story, courtesy of AP, on the US’ vaccine offering to the world. Diplomacy or philanthropy, one would ask. The US will donate 75% of its unused Covid-19 vaccines to the UN-backed Covax global vaccine sharing program, President Joe Biden announced Thursday as more Americans have been vaccinated and global inequities have become more glaring. The White House unveiled the allocation for sharing a first 25 million doses with the world, part of its plans to share 80 million globally by the end of June. The administration says 25% will be kept in reserve for emergencies and for the US to share directly with allies and partners. “As long as this pandemic is raging anywhere in the world, the American people will still be vulnerable,” Biden said in a statement. “And the United States is committed to bringing the same urgency to international vaccination efforts that we have demonstrated at home.” Of the first tranche of 25 million doses, the White House says about 19 million will go to Covax, with approximately 6 million for South and Central America, 7 million for Asia, and 5 million for Africa. The doses mark a substantial — and immediate — boost to the lagging Covax effort, which to date has shared just 76 million doses with needy countries. US national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the US “will retain the say in terms of where” the doses distributed through Covax ultimately go. “We’re not seeking to extract concessions, we’re not extorting, we’re not imposing conditions the way that other countries who are providing doses are doing; we’re doing none of those things,” said Sullivan. “These are doses that are being given, donated free and clear to these countries, for the sole purpose of improving the public health situation and helping end the pandemic.” The remaining 6 million will be directed by the White House to US allies and partners, including Mexico, Canada, and the Republic of Korea, West Bank and Gaza, India, Ukraine, Kosovo, Haiti, Georgia, Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, and Yemen, as well as for United Nations frontline workers. The long-awaited vaccine sharing plan comes as demand for shots in the U.S. has dropped significantly — more than 63% of adults have received at least one dose — and as global inequities in supply have become more glaring. Scores of countries have requested doses from the United States, but to date only Mexico and Canada have received a combined 4.5 million doses. The U.S. also has announced plans to share enough shots with South Korea to vaccinate its 550,000 troops who serve alongside American service members on the peninsula. The growing US stockpile of Covid-19 vaccines is seen by many overseas and at home not only as a testament to America’s achievement but also its global privilege. The White House also announced that it is lifting restrictions on sharing vaccines produced by AstraZeneca, as well as Sanofi and Novavax, which are also not authorised in the US, allowing the companies to determine themselves where to share their doses. The heads of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank have urged the G7 advanced economies to release any excess Covid-19 vaccines to developing countries as soon as possible, and called on manufacturers to ramp up production. In a joint statement to the G7, IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva and World Bank president David Malpass, also called on governments, pharmaceutical companies and groups involved in vaccines procurement to boost transparency about contracting, financing and deliveries. “Distributing vaccines more widely is both an urgent economic necessity, and a moral imperative,” they said. “The coronavirus pandemic will not end until everyone has access to vaccines, including people in developing countries.” A cruise ship arrived today in Venice, Italy, for the first time in 17 months, signalling the return of tourists after the coronavirus pandemic but enraging those who decry the impact of the giant floating hotels on the world heritage site. Its presence in Venice is proving no less controversial than it was before the pandemic. Environmental protesters warn the large waves caused by the cruise ships are eroding the foundations of the buildings in Venice, which with its lagoon are designated a UNESCO heritage site. Celebrities and cultural figures including Mick Jagger, Francis Ford Coppola and Richard Armstrong, director of the New York’s Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, this week called for an end to the passage of large ships through the lagoon. In an open letter to the Italian government calling for a range of measures to better protect the city, they warned the historic site risked being “swept away” by the ships. France has reported 2,677 people in intensive care units with Covid-19 today, down by 77 from yesterday. The health ministry also reported that the total number of coronavirus deaths in French hospitals had increased by 70 to 83,409 over the past 24 hours. Portugal has been removed from the UK government’s “green list” of destinations from which people can return to England without having to quarantine, and no extra countries have been added, it is understood. The decision, set to be confirmed later today with an updated list of countries on green, amber and red lists, will dismay holidaymakers and the travel industry, with hundreds of millions of pounds immediately wiped off the value of tour operators and airlines. US president Joe Biden has announced how the country is to share some 25 million of a planned 80 million Covid-19 vaccines with the rest of the world. The US will donate nearly 19 million doses of its Covid-19 vaccine through the Covax facility, he said in a statement. Through Covax, some 6 million doses would go to Latin America and the Caribbean, some 7 million for South and Southeast Asia and roughly 5 million for Africa. The remaining doses, amounting to just over 6 million, would go directly from the US to countries including Canada, Mexico, India and Korea, he said. Yesterday, UK prime minster Boris Johnson said he saw nothing in the current data to stop the planned lifting of Covid restrictions in England on 21 June. But he said questions remained over how much protection the current vaccines offered against the Delta variant, B.1.617.2. Countries in Africa are poorly prepared for a third wave of coronavirus pandemic, with many severely lacking the clinics and medical workers needed to treat critically ill patients, the UN has warned. “The threat of a third wave in Africa is real and rising,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the World Health Organization’s regional director for the continent, on Thursday, according to AFP. Many African hospitals and clinics are still far from ready to cope with a huge rise in critically ill patients. Across the continent, about 4.8m cases of coronavirus and 130,000 related deaths have so far been officially recorded, representing 2.9% of global cases and 3.7% of deaths. There has been a rise in infections in recent weeks, with the WHO warning in a statement that the pandemic is trending upwards in 14 countries. A survey conducted last month of 23 African countries found most had less than one intensive care unit (ICU) bed per 100,000 population and only one-third had mechanical ventilators. By comparison, rich countries such as Germany and the United States have more than 25 ICU beds per 100,000 people. Moeti said in an online briefing: Many African hospitals and clinics are still far from ready to cope with a huge rise in critically-ill patients. We must better equip our hospitals and medical staff to avert the worst effects of a runaway surge. India has placed an order for 300m doses of an as-yet unapproved coronavirus vaccine, a day after its Supreme Court criticised the government for bungling the country’s vaccination programme. An advance of $205.6m will be paid to local firm Biological-E for the vaccines, the health ministry said, according to the Reuters news agency. The company’s vaccine candidate is still undergoing Phase III clinical trials. The ministry said in a statement: The arrangement with Biological-E is part of the wider endeavour of the government of India to encourage indigenous vaccine manufacturers by providing them support in research &amp; development and also financial support. India, the world’s second most populous country, is currently dealing with a widespread second wave of coronavirus infections, with about 170,000 Covid deaths recorded in the past two months. Just less than 5% of India’s 950m adult population have received two doses of coronavirus vaccine so far. The country’s vaccine programme has been using AstraZeneca shots produced at the Serum Institute of India, as well as Covaxin made by local firm Bharat Biotech, and is set to commercially launch Russia’s Sputnik V in mid-June. But supplies are running short after the government opened vaccinations to all adults last month. Some vaccination centres have had to close down, prompting criticism from the Supreme Court about a lack of planning. While the federal government gave free vaccines to the elderly and frontline workers, it left state governments and private hospitals to administer doses to people in the 18-45 age group at a price. “The policy of the central government of conducting free vaccination themselves for groups under the first two phases, and replacing it with paid vaccination...is, prima facie, arbitrary and irrational,” the Supreme Court said. In Greece, the government is to target tens of thousands of undocumented migrants living in government-run camps in the next phase of its vaccination campaign. Health Ministry officials said the single-dose Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine was being used for the programme, which is to begin on the islands of Lesbos, Chios and Samos before later expanding to other Greek islands and the mainland later this week, according to an Associated Press wire report. About 60,000 migrants and asylum-seekers currently live in camps, shelters, and government-subsidised flats in Greece. About one-quarter are children and not currently eligible to receive vaccines. The expansion of Greece’s vaccination programme comes after the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control urged EU states to “ensure equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines and ensure equitable uptake” for migrants and the wider population. Nearly one in five Greek residents have been fully vaccinated, according to government figures published Thursday. People in Bahrain who have already received two doses of China’s Sinopharm coronavirus vaccine are being offered a booster shot of the Pfizer-BioNTech version. The Middle East island is currently in the midst of its worst wave of pandemic so far, despite being one of the countries with the most vaccinations per capita, according to the Associated Press. The government has now recommended people over 50, the obese and people with weakened immune systems receive the Pfizer shot regardless of whether they first received Sinopharm. The vaccines use different technologies. Pfizer’s, a so-called “mRNA vaccine,” contains a piece of genetic code that trains the immune system to recognise the spike protein on the surface of the virus. Sinopharm’s is an “inactivated” vaccine, made by growing the whole virus in a lab and then killing it. The United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, both of which heavily relied on Sinopharm in their initial vaccination drives, announced in May that they’d offer a third shot of Sinopharm vaccine amid concerns about an insufficient antibody response. China’s top disease control official acknowledged in April that the country’s locally produced vaccines offer low protection against the virus, adding to growing questions over the shot’s efficacy. The UAE and Bahrain rank among the world’s top vaccinators on a per-capita basis. Yet Bahrain, home to some 1.6m people, is in the throes of its worst wave yet of the virus, forcing the kingdom into a two-week lockdown. In response to questions from The Associated Press, Bahrain’s government said “the people of Bahrain have a choice of vaccine when choosing their booster appointment six months after their original vaccinations.” “All the data from the Ministry of Health has shown all the vaccines in use in Bahrain are providing similar high levels of protection against COVID-19,” the government said, adding that 90% of new cases in Bahrain were “people who had chosen to receive no vaccinations.” Venice has received its first visit from a cruise ship in 17 months, as tourists finally returned to the lagoon city after the coronavirus pandemic. The MSC Orchestra arrived empty from Piraeus, Greece, and will pick up about 650 passengers on Saturday, before heading south to Bari, Corfu, Mykonos and Dubrovnik, according to French news agency AFP. Covid restrictions limit the numbers on board to a fraction of the Orchestra’s usual capacity of 3,000 passengers. All were required to show negative Covid tests before embarking However, their presence in Venice is proving no less controversial than it was before the pandemic. Two demonstrations were planned for Saturday - one in support of the cruise ship, one against. Environmental protesters say the large waves caused by the cruise ships are eroding the foundations of the buildings in Venice, designated a heritage site by UNESCO. Italy’s government announced in March that cruise ships would no longer sail past Venice’s iconic St Mark’s Square and dock in the historic centre, but instead be diverted to the city’s industrial port. However, the infrastructure is not yet in place for this to happen. This is Damien Gayle taking the reins of the live blog from Mattha, while he has a well-earned rest. You can get in touch with me through my Twitter account, @damiengayle, or via email to damien.gayle@theguardian.com. John Hopkins university has confirmed that more than two billion vaccine doses have been distributed worldwide. It puts the figure at 2,002,917,476 after we reported an AFP tally earlier with similar figures. Israel remains the country with the most vaccinated, with nearly six-in-10 people in the country fully inoculated against Covid. It is followed by Canada (59% of the population have had at least one jab), the UK (58.3%), Chile (56.6%) and the US (51%), according to AFP. Six out of 10 of the injections have been administered in the world’s three most populous countries – China (704.8 million doses), the US (296.9 million) and India (221 million). Only six countries in the world have not yet started vaccinating - North Korea, Haiti, Tanzania, Chad, Burundi and Eritrea. Asylum-seekers in Greece have been receiving coronavirus shots as authorities began rolling out vaccinations in migrant camps. Reuters reports that the government, which began vaccinating the general public in January, had been criticised by rights groups for being slow to include asylum-seekers, at risk in overcrowded camps where sanitary conditions are poor and social-distancing impossible. There are about 12,100 asylum-seekers on five Greek islands close to Turkey, and about 9,400 of those live in official camps, according to the United Nations’ refugee agency UNHCR. Today, vaccinations began on the islands of Lesbos, Chios and Samos with Johnson &amp; Johnson’s single-dose shot, said Anastasios Chatzis, an official with the National Organization of Public Health. “We have the vaccines, we have the staff, the mood is positive,” Chatzis said from Lesbos. “We have a long but good road ahead, and we hope everything goes well.” The head of a Pakistani province has decreed that government employees who refuse to be vaccinated against Covid would not be paid from next month. Sindh chief minister Murad Ali Shah announced the move after meeting with health officials to discuss the first cases of the delta variant detected in the province, which includes Karachi, AFP reports. “Any government employee who is not vaccinated should have their salary stopped from July,” he tweeted, adding that orders had been given to the finance ministry. The country has fully vaccinated only around 2.2 million people – a fraction of its 220 million population. The requirement to have a mobile phone to register for a shot has proved a barrier for some poor and illiterate citizens. Every cloud has a silver lining, or indeed perhaps one made of latex. Sexually-transmitted infections (STIs) declined sharply in Norway last year thanks to physical distancing rules, official statistics show. AFP reports that the country saw a 39% reduction in gonorrhoea cases, an 11% drop in chlamydia cases, and a 20-percent decline in HIV cases in 2020. “The drop in the number of STIs in 2020 is most probably linked to anti-Covid measures, such as travel restrictions, social distancing and the closure of bars and restaurants,” Oyvind Nilsen of Norway’s Institute of Public Health (FHI) said in a statement. Nilsen said a drop in testing due to the pandemic played only a marginal role in the decline. Meanwhile, the only STI to register a rise in cases was syphilis, up by 39% and qualified as “surprising” by FHI. “One possible explanation for the rise in syphilis among men having sexual relations with other men – while gonorrhoea has seen a sharp decline – could be that syphilis has fewer symptoms, has a longer transmission phase than gonorrhoea and the infection is highly contagious,” said Nilsen. She added: “We always have problems convincing young people to use condoms. Before they settle down with a stable partner, their sex life is largely made up of multiple short-term relationships and no condoms.” Norway, a country of 5.4 million, is among the countries least affected by Covid-19, with 125,881 cases and 785 deaths. The country had no excess mortality last year. On the contrary, the number of deaths declined by 73 in 2020 from the previous year, even though it was a leap year. The UN’s health agency has said it had detected a surge late last month in coronavirus cases in Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo. “An exponential rise in the spread of SARS-Cov-2 virus has been recorded in Kinshasa,” the World Health Organization (WHO) said in a weekly report. The rise mirrored a “clear deterioration” in the wider province of Kinshasa, it said. AFP reports that a DRC health ministry official said “the third wave of Covid-19 is already there - it’s the Indian [Delta] and South African [Beta] variants.” “This wave could be deadlier than the previous ones,” the official said, blaming lax adherence to social distancing and face masks. The WHO said that the mortality rate across the country was currently unchanged at 2.5%, but noted concern about the presence of the Delta variant in Kinshasa. So far, the city - and the DRC itself - have been relatively spared from the impact of coronavirus compared to South Africa, the worst-hit country in Africa, and states in other continents. As of yesterday, the DRC had recorded 32,176 confirmed cases of the disease, of which 789 were fatal. A German police force has established a dedicated team to counteract an ascendant illegal trade in fake vaccine certificates, the BBC reports. Some people are conned into paying about €100 for both dud certificates and workable ones over the encrypted Telegram messenger service which unlike other platforms authorities cannot access conversations on. The certificates are reported to have become increasingly desirable to those hesitant to receive the Covid jab, as proving vaccination can provide greater freedoms in Germany. Six suspected criminals are being investigated by the new unit, Cologne police spokeswoman Nicole Gentner said, according to the BBC. One Telegram offer quoted by German broadcaster MDR read: “The order with stamp - already available - takes 1-3 days. We will give you a certificate, stamp, BioNTech or Astra sticker and signature on the stamp. Two certificates cost €150.” The war of words continues between Taiwan and China – with the island state having accused the superpower of meddling with its efforts to source vaccines. Taiwan’s foreign minister has said China is seeking political gains abroad in return for providing vaccines and other pandemic assistance, partly to increase pressure on Taiwan, which it claims as its own territory. AP reports that Beijing’s leaders “further exploited the pandemic to impose their political agenda on many others,” according to Joseph Wu in a video conference with the Foreign Correspondents’ Club of Japan. In particular, China’s “vaccine diplomacy” is creating divisions among countries in Central and South America, giving Beijing an opportunity to exert its influence in the Western Hemisphere, Wu said. The World Health Organization’s Covax scheme also gives vaccines freely to countries in need. Beijing is providing access to its domestically produced vaccines, other anti-coronavirus resources and development funding to “those who are willing to accept political partnership with Beijing,” he said. “China then uses this partnership to lure or pressure those allies of Taiwan and the US to lean toward Beijing. Through these manoeuvrings, China is trying to gain political influence in the region at the cost of Taiwan and the US.” China has sold hundreds of millions of coronavirus vaccine doses abroad and donated millions more, mainly to developing nations in Africa. The WHO has given emergency authorisation for two Chinese-developed vaccines, but the companies, particularly Sinopharm, have faced criticism over a lack of transparency in sharing data. China has shut Taiwan out of an increasing number of international organisations, including the WHO, and has blocked Taiwan’s cooperation with Covax. India has signed its first order for a Covid-19 vaccine still undergoing trials as it seeks to inoculate more of its population, with no more than 5% of its 950 million adult population so far having received both doses. The government will buy 300 million vaccine doses from local firm Biological-E and has put down an advance of $205.6 million, the health ministry said, even though the vaccine is still going through Phase III clinical trials, Reuters reports. “The arrangement with Biological-E is part of the wider endeavour of government of India to encourage indigenous vaccine manufacturers by providing them support in research &amp; development and also financial support,” the ministry said in a statement. India has been inoculating its people with AstraZeneca shots produced at the Serum Institute of India, Covaxin made by local firm Bharat Biotech and is set to commercially launch Russia’s Sputnik V in mid-June. But supplies are running short after the government opened vaccinations to all adults last month. Some vaccination centres have had to close down, prompting criticism from the Supreme Court about a lack of planning. Reuters has this dispatch from San Marino, the micro-state surrounded by northern Italy which is banking on a new way to attract visitors - vaccine tourism. Europe’s smallest independent state after Vatican City and Monaco last month began offering the Russian Sputnik V Covid-19 shot to tourists. About 250 have so far received their first dose. Hotels handle the paperwork after a tourist sends an email. The visitors typically stay three days for both first and second jabs. “The guest arrives, stays here for three days, the day after his arrival we accompany him to receive the first dose, and then he comes back after 21 days for the second dose,” said Francesco Brigante, director of the IDesign Hotel. The programme, which is helping San Marino’s tourism sector emerge from a Covid slump, is restricted to people who are not resident in Italy. Igor Pershin, a Russian who lives in the Czech Republic, travelled to San Marino with his wife and stayed at the IDesign after hearing about the programme on Russian TV. “In the Czech Republic, it is difficult to get vaccinated, especially for foreigners,” Pershin said. “I only wanted to get the Sputnik vaccine and I only wanted to get it in San Marino so I booked a hotel.” Apart from hotel costs, the price for two doses of the vaccine is about €50 euros. “We came here from Germany because we want to get vaccinated with Sputnik V and because in Germany they haven’t given us an appointment yet”, said Gioele Cozzolino. Sweden’s government failed in several aspects of its handling of the pandemic, the country’s parliament’s constitutional committee has said. The government was slow to put in place a testing and tracing system, failed to protect of the elderly and there was a lack of clear lines of responsibility between national and local authorities, Reuters reports the committee – which did not criticise Sweden’s absence of sweeping lockdown measure – as saying. “It is ... clear that Sweden was not sufficiently prepared before [the pandemic] and we can learn from many of the underlying failures that have been identified,” Hans Ekstrom, deputy chairman of the committee and a lawmaker from the governing Social Democrat party, told a hearing. Sweden has been an outlier in the fight against the pandemic and has opted against lockdowns, instead relying on mostly voluntary measures as well as bans on mass gatherings amid a shift to mostly home working. The death toll has been higher than that among its Nordic neighbours, but lower than in most European countries that opted for lockdowns. The committee said that the government should have been quicker to set up a framework for testing and tracing, quicker to draw up a law giving it wider powers to deal with the crisis and quicker to isolate care homes for the elderly, Reuters reports. “The government’s response was not sufficient,” committee chairperson Karin Enstrom, of the opposition Moderate Party, said. “The elderly were particularly vulnerable ... and ... the government should have acted more forcefully.” The Social Democrat-led government has already accepted that it did not do enough to protect elderly residents of care homes. The pandemic has severely affected children’s rights worldwide, with young people risking a “generational catastrophe” if governments do not act, a rights group has said in an annual survey. Millions of children have missed out on education because of Covid-19 restrictions while there will be a long term impact in terms of their physical and mental health, Dutch NGO KidsRights said as it launched its annual ranking, AFP reports. The survey ranks Iceland, Switzerland and Finland as best for children’s rights and Chad, Afghanistan and Sierra Leone as the worst, out of a total of 182 countries. Marc Dulleart, founder and chairman of KidsRights, said that the effects of the pandemic on children had “unfortunately exceeded our predictions at the outset last year”. Apart from patients of the coronavirus, children have been hardest hit, not directly by the virus itself, but fundamentally failed through the deferred actions of governments around the world. Educational recovery is the key to avoiding generational catastrophe. The group said schools for more than 168 million children have been closed for almost a full year, with one-in-three children worldwide unable to access remote learning while their schools were shut. An additional 142 million kids fell into material poverty as the global economy was hit by the pandemic and the responses to it, while 370 million kids missed out on school meals. Italy has today opened vaccinations for everybody over the age of 12, after the European Medicines Agency approved the Pfizer/BioNTech jab for 12 to 15-year-olds last week. “It’s a beautiful day,” said Naples mayor Luigi de Magistris, saying it was an “excellent signal for both containing the pandemic and for resuming as soon as possible all forms of... activity.” After a slow start due to organisational issues and lack of supply, Italy’s vaccination programme has been accelerating. More than 35 million doses have been administered, with 12.4 million people - almost 23% of the population - now fully vaccinated, according to health ministry figures. Hailing the widening of the vaccination programme, health minister Robert Speranza said: “We can still accelerate our campaign to get through this difficult season.” However, health experts have warned that immunising children against Covid should only be considered in special circumstances due to the potential of it raising important practical and ethical problems. “Children transmit Covid to some extent, although they rarely suffer badly from the disease themselves. If you offer them vaccines, then you put them at risk of possible side-effects – so there really needs to be some significant, tangible benefit to them, not just the indirect protection of adults from Covid-19,” said Prof Adam Finn of Bristol University last week. More than two billion Covid-19 vaccines have been given across the world, according to an AFP tally drawn from official sources. The milestone comes six months after the first vaccination campaigns against Covid-19 began. At least 2,109,696,022 shots have been given in 215 countries and territories, according to the count from an AFP database. Israel remains the country with the most vaccinated, with nearly six-in-10 people in the country fully inoculated against Covid. It is followed by Canada (59% of the population have had at least one jab), the UK (58.3%), Chile (56.6%) and the US (51%). Six out of 10 of the injections have been administered in the world’s three most populous countries – China (704.8 million doses), the US (296.9 million) and India (221 million). Nearly four-in-10 people in the EU have had at least one shot, with Germany leading with 43.6%, followed by Italy (40%) and France and Spain on 39.4%. Only six countries in the world have not yet started vaccinating - North Korea, Haiti, Tanzania, Chad, Burundi and Eritrea. But with vaccination programmes now accelerating, China leads the league of countries giving doses the fastest over the last week, injecting 1.37% of its population per day. Bahrain and Uruguay are also covering about 1% a day. Greece is to supply its northern neighbours Albania and North Macedonia with 40,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccines, the country’s spokeswoman has said. “Greece, in coordination with the European Commission, as most European countries do for their neighbours, will offer vaccines ... 20,000 doses to North Macedonia and 20,000 to Albania,” Aristotelia Peloni told a news conference. Covid is many times more prevalent in Indonesia than shown by official figures in the world’s fourth most populous country, authors of two new studies told Reuters. The news agency reports the country of 270 million has recorded 1.83 million positive cases, but epidemiologists have long believed the true scale of the spread has been obscured by a lack of testing and contact tracing. One nationwide study between December and January suggested 15% of Indonesians had already contracted the virus - when official figures at the end of January had recorded infections among only around 0.4% of people. Even now, Indonesia’s total positive infections are only around 0.7% of the population. The results of the survey were not unexpected given under reporting, said Pandu Riono, a University of Indonesia epidemiologist who worked on the study carried out with help from the World Health Organisation. Siti Nadia Tarmizi, a senior health ministry official, said it was possible the study was preliminary, but there might be more cases than officially reported because many cases were asymptomatic. She said Indonesia had a lack of contact tracing and not enough laboratories to process tests. Once touted by former US president Donald Trump, and subsequently derided by some as lacking efficacy evidence, the potential Covid treatment based on a cocktail of monoclonal antibodies developed by US drugmaker Regeneron and Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche has been purchased by the EU to the tune of about 55,000 doses. Reuters reports that the deal is the bloc’s first contract for this kind of drug, as it aims to identify 10 promising treatments by the end of the month amid a failure by pharmaceutical companies to swiftly deliver sufficient supplies of vaccines after initial promise. The deal with Roche was reached in April, the company told Reuters, but contract details were not made public. A European Commission spokesman said the EU had secured about 55,000 doses of the single-dose treatment. The only other anti-Covid drug the EU has bought is Gilead’s remdesivir, an antiviral medicine. Last year, the EU reserved half a million courses after the drug obtained a conditional EU approval. European countries would buy the Roche-Regeneron drug, which is composed of the monoclonal antibodies casirivimab and imdevimab, only after it was approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) or by national drug regulators. “The EU authorisation is expected between August and October 2021,” an EU document says, citing Roche estimates.

Hong Kong will open its vaccine scheme to children over the age of 12, as it pursues a broader campaign across the city to incentivise its 7.5 million residents to get vaccinated. The region started its vaccination programme in February but only around 14% of the population have been fully vaccinated so far. Another 17 people have died in Taiwan, where authorities reported 364 new local cases and 219 backlogged cases added to previous days’ totals. It brings Taiwan’s total death toll to 166, of which 154 have been since 15 May. Bulgaria plans to provide about 150,000 Covid vaccines to its Balkan neighbours, health minister Stoicho Katsarov has said. It has the lowest inoculation rates in the European Union, but Katsarov said the country has agreed to receive about 13m doses under the EU supply scheme by the end of the year and can afford to help other countries. “The idea is to distribute up to 150,000 doses among our neighbouring western Balkan countries,” Katsarov said, adding that Sofia has received requests from North Macedonia, Albania, Kosovo and Bosnia. A coronavirus variant which Vietnam authorities thought was a combination of the Indian and UK strains is not a new hybrid, but part of the existing Indian strain, the World Health Organization’s representative in Vietnam has said. The WHO in Nepal has also denied reports that there is a “Nepal variant” causing concern. Syria has received its first shipment of Russian Sputnik V vaccine. Syrian President Bashar Assad was inoculated with the vaccine, the Syrian ambassador to Moscow said. The Serum Institute of India has sought regulatory approval to make Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine, on top of the AstraZeneca and Novavax shots it is already producing. Indonesia has cancelled the haj pilgrimage for people in the world’s largest Muslim-majority nation for a second year in a row due to concerns over the pandemic. Infection rates in Germany continue to drop as the country slowly emerges from eight months of lockdown, but politicians are urging caution over a possible variant-driven resurgence at the end of the summer. Seiko Hashimoto, the president of the Tokyo 2020 organising committee has ruled out a cancellation or further postponement of the Olympics, amid concerns about hosting the event during a global pandemic. “We cannot postpone again,” she said in an interview And you might be interested in the latest episode of the Guardian’s Today In Focus podcast, exploring the Wuhan lab leak theory… Reuters have very handily – for me, if not for you – wrapped up exactly which countries in Europe are now allowing children and adolescents to be vaccinated. France will start vaccinating teenagers from age 12 on 15 June Germany plans to offer a first shot to children aged 12-16 from 7 June, while Poland would offer shots to those aged 12-15 the same day. Lithuania’s prime minister said the country could start vaccinating children from age 12 in June. Italy on 31 May approved extending the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to 12-15 year olds. Austria aims to have over 340,000 children aged 12-15 vaccinated by the end of August. Hungary started vaccinating 16-18-year-olds in mid-May. Switzerland’s health watchdog said in early May Pfizer had sought approval for its shot in children aged 12-15. San Marino on 1 June opened vaccinations for children aged 12-15. Infection rates in Germany continue to drop as the country slowly emerges from eight months of lockdown, but politicians are urging caution over a possible variant-driven resurgence at the end of the summer. The seven-day incidence of infections per 100,000 people over seven days dropped to 34.1 on Thursday, with 4,640 new infections reported by Germany’s disease control agency, the Robert Koch Institute. Social Democrat delegate Karl Lauterbach, a trained doctor and prominent health expert, said he expected the incidence rate to remain around 35 in the coming weeks, as people spent more time outdoors during the summer and more and more people were fully immunised. Some 53 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines have been administered in Germany so far, and 44.6% of the population has had at least one shot. Lauterbach said he expected the “Delta variant” of the virus that was first detected in India to become more dominant in Germany after the holidays, saying it “will probably spread around numerous European countries in the coming months”. For now, the Delta variant B1.617.2 only plays a minor role in Germany, making up 2.1 percent of cases reported over the last week. Nonetheless Germany is one of the European countries who have imposed restrictions on travel from the United Kingdom over the variant, with anyone entering Germany from the UK will be required quarantine for two weeks on arrival, even if they test negative for the coronavirus. Regular readers of this blog will know that I usually slightly raise one eyebrow when reporting the official numbers out of Russia as they are remarkably consistent. They’ve pretty much been in the range of 7,000 to 9,500 daily every day since early March, which feels unusual as it suggest the virus is neither gathering pace or diminishing, which tends not to be how epidemics behave. Today is no different, as Russia reported 8,933 new cases taking the official national tally since the pandemic began to 5,099,182. The government coronavirus task force said 393 people had died of coronavirus linked causes in the past 24 hours, pushing the national death toll to 122,660. Reuters always note that the federal statistics agency has kept a separate count and has said Russia recorded significantly more fatalities than that. They put the figure at around 250,000 deaths related to Covid from April 2020 to March 2021. My colleague Nicola Slawson has just opened up the UK live blog for the day – so if you are looking for UK Covid news, that’s where you need to head. I’ll be continuing here with global updates. Bulgaria plans to provide about 150,000 Covid vaccines to its Balkan neighbours, health minister Stoicho Katsarov has said. Bulgaria has the lowest inoculation rates in the European Union, but Katsarov said the country has agreed to receive about 13m doses under the EU supply scheme by the end of the year and can afford to help other countries. “The idea is to distribute up to 150,000 doses among our neighbouring western Balkan countries,” Katsarov told reporters, adding that Sofia has received requests from North Macedonia, Albania, Kosovo and Bosnia. “Our needs are fully covered so there is no danger whatsoever that Bulgaria can be left without vaccines,” he said. Reuters report Katsarov said he expects to receive an answer on Friday from the European Commission how exactly the country should proceed and whether it could donate or sell the doses. He said Bulgaria was looking to donate mostly AstraZeneca vaccines, not least because of the low interest in them at home. Last week president Rumen Radev said Sofia plans to donate a significant amount of vaccines to North Macedonia in a move that could help improve strained relations over Bulgaria’s veto on the start of EU accession talks with Skopje. A quick one from Sky here, that the reopening of indoor hospitality last month failed to boost footfall in town centres in England. The figures are compiled by a company called Springboard, and they said: May was the wettest on record which inevitably lowered the initial exhilaration of consumers in being able to eat out as even visiting indoor environments necessitated braving the weather. Secondly, the limitations on dining capacity in indoor venues inevitably means that the uplift in footfall generated has been limited; and thirdly most of the increase in footfall has occurred post 5pm when volumes of activity are far lower those than during retail trading hours. Footfall in May 2021 was around 25% down on the same pre-pandemic period in 2019 Hong Kong will open its vaccine scheme to children over the age of 12 for the first time, Reuters report, as it pursues a broader campaign across the city to incentivise its 7.5 million residents to get vaccinated. The region started its vaccination programme in February but only around 14% of the population have been fully vaccinated so far. Another 17 people have died in Taiwan, where authorities reported 364 new local cases and 219 backlogged cases added to previous days’ totals. It brings Taiwan’s total death toll to 166, of which 154 have been since 15 May. Taiwan’s worst outbreak since the pandemic began continues to report high daily numbers, but analyses of the general trend are tentatively suggesting a decline. Finding trends in the data has been made difficult during this outbreak, as a backlog of cases routinely adds dozens of cases to previous days. In its daily briefing today, the central epidemic command centre reported details of a growing outbreak in aged care, and a cluster among migrant workers in Miaoli county. Ahead of an upcoming long weekend, health and welfare minister Chen Chih-Shung urged people not to travel. Taiwan is on level 3 of a four tier alert system which does not stop people from traveling. Restrictions limit gatherings to 10 outside and five inside, restaurants are take-away only, and employers have been urged to facilitate working from home, although this has not been widely taken up. Another quick Reuters snap here, that Syria has received the first shipment of Russian Sputnik V vaccine. Syrian President Bashar Assad was inoculated with the vaccine, Syrian ambassador to Russia Riad Haddad said. Also on variants, Reuters report that a coronavirus variant which Vietnam authorities thought was a combination of the Indian and UK strains is not a new hybrid but part of the existing Indian strain, the World Health Organization’s representative in Vietnam told Nikkei. “There is no new hybrid variant in Vietnam at this moment based on WHO definition,” Kidong Park said in an online interview with the newspaper, adding that it was within the “Delta variation” that was first detected in India. In the UK today the Daily Mail is carrying a front page story warning of the threat from what they call a “Nepal variant”. The World Health Organization in Nepal have put out a tweet this morning saying that they aren’t aware of any such variant. One of things we are expecting today is for the UK government to announce if they are making any changes to the green, amber and red lists for international travel. A lot of people with hopes of a holiday or visiting loved ones abroad will have their eye closely on the situation – we might get that news around 11am this morning. Getting there may prove more of a headache than usual, as AFP report. A year after the coronavirus pandemic emptied airports, air travel associations fear chaos during Europe’s summer holiday season as travellers could wait hours before boarding planes due to health checks. Strict controls are still in place at most European airports even though vaccination campaigns are making progress and infection rates are falling. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) reported last week that on average, people travelling at peak times now stay twice as long at airports - three hours - compared with 2019. That time is generally spent checking in, passing security and immigration controls, picking up checked bags and making it through customs. And there’s the new reality: Airlines having to check passengers’ Covid tests, temperature and other health documents. The wait time has increased even though the volume of traffic is “only about 30 percent of pre-Covid-19 levels”, an IATA statement said. The sector lobby group warned that time spent in airports could swell to five hours and 30 minutes if traffic rebounds to 75 percent of its pre-pandemic level, and even longer “without process improvements”. The EU Digital Covid Certificate - showing whether a traveller was vaccinated, has immunity from a previous infection or passed a coronavirus test - will be rolled out on 1 July in an effort to make travel smoother within the 27-nation bloc. “The level of both uncertainty and complexity in planning for the restart is just mind blowing for now,” said the director general of the European branch of Airports Control International, Olivier Jankovec. His association represents 500 airports on the continent. “With each passing day, the prospect of travellers enduring widespread chaos at airports this summer is becoming more real.” Indonesia has cancelled the haj pilgrimage for people in the world’s largest Muslim-majority nation for a second year in a row due to concerns over the pandemic, the religious affairs minister said this morning. Reuters report that minister Yaqut Cholil Qoumas told a briefing that Saudi Arabia, where the pilgrimage takes place, had not opened access to the haj. In the UK, Labour’s opposition spokesperson James Murray has also been trailing round the TV and radio studios. On the proposals for catch-up funding for pupils in England, he told Sky News: I think everyone listening to the show will realise that what the government is doing by shortchanging children feels wrong, and it’s also the ultimate false economy. If we don’t invest in protecting our children now, and making sure that their education catches up, that they are prepared in terms of their mental wellbeing and so on, it’s going to cost the country and the economy dearly in the long run. Seth Borenstein, science writer at AP, reports that in the US, new White House science adviser Eric Lander wants to have a vaccine ready to fight the next pandemic in just about 100 days after recognizing a potential viral outbreak. In his first interview after being sworn in, he painted a rosy near future where a renewed American emphasis on science not only better prepares the world for the next pandemic with plug-and-play vaccines, but also changes how medicine fights disease and treats patients, curbs climate change and further explores space. “This is a moment in so many ways, not just health, that we can rethink fundamental assumptions about what’s possible and that’s true of climate and energy and many areas,” Lander told The Associated Press. “It was amazing at one level that we were able to produce highly effective vaccines in less than a year, but from another point of view you’d say, ‘Boy, a year’s a long time,”’ even though in the past it would take three years or four years, Lander said. “To really make a difference we want to get this done in 100 days. And so a lot of us have been talking about a 100-day target from the recognition from a virus with pandemic potential.” “It would mean that we would have had a vaccine in early April if that had happened this time, early April of 2020,” Lander said. “It makes you gulp for a second, but it’s totally feasible to do that.” He is the first director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy to be promoted to Cabinet level in a US administration. Lander said President Joe Biden’s elevation of the science post is a symbolic show “that science should have a seat at the table” but also allows him to have higher-level talks with different agency chiefs about making policy. A very quick Reuters snap here that the Serum Institute of India has sought regulatory approval to make Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine, on top of the AstraZeneca and Novavax shots it is already producing. In England, much of the news this morning has been dominated by the continued fall-out over the government’s plans for education “catch-up” spending. Yesterday Sir Kevan Collins quit, said to be dismayed that his long-awaited £15bn proposals were watered down to a £1.4bn package. Home Office minister Victoria Atkins has been out and about fronting up the government response, saying that the Government’s education recovery fund was “very much focused on what we can deliver and deliver quickly” Collins said in his resignation statement that the package of support is “too narrow, too small and will be delivered too slowly”. When asked on Sky News, Atkins said she had not read the resignation statement – which does seem somewhat extraordinary given that she’s been sent out this morning specifically to rebut it She told Sky News the Government was “continuing to look at things like lengthening the school day”. Meanwhile, PA report that senior Conservative MP Robert Halfon said the Government must “decide their priorities in terms of education” and that the Treasury can “find the money from the back of the sofa”, where there is the political will. The chairman of the Education Select Committee told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “Of course there are funding constraints but the Treasury announced over £16bn extra for defence only last year, we’ve got £800m being spent on a new research agency, £200m being spent on a yacht. “So where there is the political will, the Treasury can find the money from the back of the sofa, and there has to be that political will because we need a long-term plan for education, a proper funding settlement.” He said the damage caused by Covid-19 to younger children “has been nothing short of disastrous”. Oliver Laughland brings us a special report on vaccine hesitancy this morning from Tuskegee and Florala in the US: In 1997, President Bill Clinton apologized for the Tuskegee study, which he described as “clearly racist”. Two decades on, the legacy of what happened here has been routinely cited as a reason many Black Americans remain distrustful of the country’s medical systems and also the Covid-19 vaccine itself. It is then, perhaps, against expectation that vaccination rates in Macon county, where this city of 8,000 residents is situated, are substantially higher than the state average in Alabama. In Macon county, 36% of residents have now received their first shot compared with only 32% statewide. In this historic region of Black Belt counties, home to large populations of Black residents, some jurisdictions have completed vaccinations at rates of over 40%. But Alabama and the neighbouring state of Mississippi have for months had the lowest vaccination rates in the country, with vaccine hesitancy underwritten by different forces in various locations across the state. In some areas local political leaders have retreated from public engagement on the issue, while in others, including Tuskegee, local leadership has played a vital role in pushing rates above the state average. Omar Neal, a local radio host and community leader, took his shot almost as soon as it was available. He weighed the heavy history but set aside what he described as instinctive distrust of public health systems after generations of failures. “Trust is a calculated risk,” he said, pausing for a moment. “Five hundred and eighty-eight thousand people have died because they didn’t get this vaccine. Nobody died that did take it. That’s pretty good odds for me.” Read more of Oliver Laughland’s report here: Alabama faces vaccine hesitancy but only some counties try to tackle it A five-pronged approach focused on the five C’s - confidence, complacency, convenience, communication and context - is needed to combat vaccine hesitancy, according to scientists from the UK, US and South Africa. PA report that writing in the Royal Society of Medicine journal, they say complacency due to lower perceptions of personal risk and disease severity, particularly among younger people and those of lower socioeconomic status, is strongly associated with lower vaccine uptake. One of the authors, Dr Mohammad Razai, of the Population Health Research Institute at St George’s, University of London, said: “As the lower age groups are being offered the vaccine, addressing complacency through repeated risk communication is crucial to facilitate informed decision-making. “It is important to emphasise the greater societal benefits of population level immunity and the protection it offers to those vulnerable, their families and friends.” The proposed strategy also focuses on convenience of vaccination delivery, communication to combat misinformation, and recognition of context including ethnicity, religion, occupation and socioeconomic status. Confidence in vaccine safety, efficacy and importance is crucial, and the public needs to be aware that for most people the benefits of vaccine “vastly outweigh the risk” of rare side effects, they write. Getting Alan Sugar to endorse the vaccine for young people was probably not on their list of priorities, but he’s done that on social media this morning in his own imitable style. Workers in Melbourne in Australia who haven’t had shifts due to the extended Covid lockdown will be eligible for up to $500 in support after the prime minister announced a new temporary Covid disaster payment. Scott Morrison said on Thursday the disaster payment would be available in areas declared a commonwealth hotspot when any lockdown lasted longer than seven days. A $500 weekly payment will be available for people who work more than 20 hours a week while $325 will be available for those who work less than that. The support will only go to people older than 17, who were working before the lockdown and who can no longer work. They will need to have less than $10,000 in savings. There are further restrictions including whether other leave – beyond annual and sick leave – is available to cover the lockdown period. Good morning, it is Martin Belam here in London taking over for the next few hours. I must say that I was one of those very sceptical about the Wuhan lab leak theory initially, as much of the evidence posted online that I saw seemed to amount to not much more than “They have a lab there, you know”. Former MI6 chief Sir Richard Dearlove possibly knows his onions a bit better than me, and he’s had some pretty stringent words about the origins of the virus on a podcast from the Telegraph, and PA have picked up the quotes this morning. He says: The People’s Republic of China is a pretty terrifying regime and does some things we consider unacceptable and extreme in silencing opposition to the official line of the government. We don’t know that’s what’s happened, but a lot of data have probably been destroyed or made to disappear so it’s going to be difficult to prove definitely the case for a ‘gain of function chimera’ being the cause of the pandemic. Trevor Marshallsea writes that Sir Richard said he felt some vindication as more people were beginning to take seriously his repeated questioning of the origins of the coronavirus. He spoke of “extraordinary behaviour” in the scientific community which had “shut down any debate” and which he said verged on “academic bullying”. China, he said, had originally been “let off the hook” on questions about the virus’s origins due to scepticism over the Trump administration, which had led such enquiries initially. He also said the West had been naive in trusting China, which had infiltrated scientific institutions and journals in the UK and elsewhere. The latest episode of the Guardian’s Today In Focus podcast is exploring the Wuhan lab leak theory. When Covid-19 first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan, much of the focus of the initial investigation fell on a seafood market that also sold exotic animals for human consumption. But in the months since, no definitive link has been proven and the precise origin story remains unsolved. In the intervening period numerous conspiracy theories have spread: that somehow 5G phone signals could be involved, or that the virus is a hoax. Bracketed in with these was a theory that Covid-19 may have been released (accidentally or otherwise) from a lab. Initially scientists poured scorn on the lab leak theory but in recent months suspicion has fallen on the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which studies coronaviruses. As the Guardian’s Peter Beaumont tells Anushka Asthana, these suspicions are still being treated with scepticism by scientists. But now, in the absence of any other confirmed origin, Joe Biden has asked US intelligence agencies to consider the lab leak theory as a possibility and to investigate. So how seriously should we take it? In Australia, Melbourne GPs say they are being forced to turn away huge numbers of vaccine-seeking locals, including busloads of vulnerable residents from care facilities, because the commonwealth’s supply of doses has not increased to match the explosion in demand. The latest outbreak has caused a huge increase in demand for the Covid-19 vaccine in Victoria, and the state is now recording daily vaccination numbers of above 20,000 in primary care, up from the roughly 2,300 doses administered on 24 May. The demand has inundated local GPs, who say their supplies of vaccine doses are evaporating almost immediately. Seiko Hashimoto, the president of the Tokyo 2020 organising committee has ruled out a cancellation or further postponement of the Olympics, amid concerns about hosting the event during a global pandemic. “We cannot postpone again,” she said in an interview with Nikkan Sports newspaper. Reuters reports: Public opinion polls in Japan have consistently shown that a majority want the Games cancelled or put off yet again after being delayed by one year because of the coronavirus crisis. A majority of the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly feel the same way, the Tokyo Shimbun newspaper reported on Thursday. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga is likely to call a snap election after the Olympic and Paralympic Games, the Asahi newspaper reported, showing his resolve to push ahead with the event. Towns and cities lined up to host Olympic training or events have increasingly expressed resistance, amid concern visitors will spread variant strains of the virus and drain medical resources. The government of Ota City has been inundated with complaints by residents over a decision to give preferential Covid-19 vaccinations to city and hotel staff tending to Australian athletes, media reported. While Japan has avoided the large-scale infections suffered by many other nations, severe cases are rising in the latest outbreak. More than 746,000 cases have been recorded and more than 13,000 deaths. Shigeru Omi, Japan’s top medical adviser, told a parliamentary committee on Wednesday that it was “not normal” to host the Olympics amid the current state of infections. Reuters: Pot-banging protests erupted across several cities in Brazil last night, as President Jair Bolsonaro addressed the nation, Reuters reports. It occurred just days after protestors took to the streets across the country over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which has so far killed almost half a million people. The last few days have been rocky for the government of the right-wing leader, whose popularity had already been flagging amid persistently high daily Covid-19 deaths and cases. On Wednesday alone, almost 100,000 Brazilians came down with the coronavirus and 2,507 died, according to government data. Earlier in the day, the nation’s Supreme Court authorised a criminal investigation into Bolsonaro’s environment minister for allegedly interfering with a police probe into illegal logging. In the televised speech, Bolsonaro briefly summarised some of his government’s recent accomplishments and pledged strong economic growth going forward, but presented no new information. On Saturday, thousands participated in protests in at least 16 cities across the country, which were organised by leftist political parties, unions and student associations. In Sao Paulo, Brazil’s largest city, thousands of mask-wearing people blocked one the largest city’s avenues, while a large balloon depicted Bolsonaro as a vampire. Some protests, like the one in Rio de Janeiro, included images of former leftist president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who has emerged as Bolsonaro’s main challenger in the nation’s 2022 election, wearing the presidential sash. In the brief Wednesday evening speech, Bolsonaro, who has ridiculed masks and vaccines in the past, said all Brazilians who wanted a vaccine would be able to get one by the end of the year. Also in the evening, the nation’s Health Ministry revised down the number of Covid-19 vaccines it will receive in June by about 4 million doses. Hello and welcome to our continuing coverage of the global pandemic. Here is a short update of developments in the last 24 hours In the US Joe Biden has announced a “national month of action” to get 70% of Americans vaccinated. Meanwhile in Australia, doctors in Melbourne say they have had to turn away patients because they don’t have enough vaccines to meet demand. The pandemic has pushed more than 100 million more workers into poverty, the UN has said. Cancellation or another postponement of the Tokyo Olympic Games has been ruled out by the head of the organising committee. France will start vaccinating teenagers from age 12 with the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine on June 15, the government said. Mexico reported 3,269 new cases of Covid-19 in the country and 306 more fatalities, Reuters reports. It brings the total to 2,423,928 infections and 228,146 deaths, according to health ministry data released on Wednesday. Spanish regions with a low Covid infection rate will be allowed to reopen nightlife before herd immunity is achieved, which is expected by mid-August, the health minister said. The Canadian province of Ontario will keep schools closed for in-person learning until the new school year starts in September, premier Doug Ford announced. Germany plans to pay vaccine manufacturers an annual reservation fee to build up reserve capacity of around 600-700m doses per year to help it fight future pandemics, the health minister said. Colombia has began what its government called a gradual opening of its border with Venezuela after a 14-month closure intended to curb the spread of the coronavirus. In Germany, the Robert Koch Institute has confirmed that a third wave of the virus has been broken. EU governments have agreed to add Japan to their small list of countries from which they will allow non-essential travel, it was reported earlier.","charCount":"78012","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/damien-gayle\">Damien Gayle</a> (now); <a href=\"profile/mattha-busby\">Mattha Busby</a>, <a href=\"profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a> and <a href=\"profile/helen-davidson\">Helen Davidson</a> (earlier)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2021/jun/03/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-03T20:00:19Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/jun/03/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2021/jun/03/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","standfirst":"<p>Tiananmen Square | Joy Division images</p>","trailText":"Tiananmen Square | Joy Division images","byline":"Corrections and clarifications column editor","main":"","body":"<p>• The Tiananmen Square protests were crushed 32 years ago, not 31 (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/02/the-guardian-view-on-remembering-tiananmen-1989-mourning-for-those-who-cannot\" title=\"\">Beijing is still working to erase the 1989 massacre.

And as Austria gingerly gather possession and work the ball backwards, you can see Harry Kane rushing up to start the press, waving the rest of the England team forward to join the charge, which they do. After a series of tentative passes in their own half, Austria’s goalkeeper, Daniel Bachmann, is hastily forced to clear to touch, pursued by a swarm of white shirts. An hour has been played at the Riverside Stadium, and England have just gone 1-0 up.</p> <p>In the alternative history of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/jun/02/england-austria-international-friendly-match-report\">Wednesday night’s game</a>, this is the point at which England, energised by Bukayo Saka’s fine goal and the exhortations of their captain, seize the moment and with it control of the game. With Austria forced to commit numbers forward in search of an equaliser, England feast on the open spaces, tear into the middling Austrians and run out comfortable winners in front of a rocking Teesside crowd.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2021/jun/02/das-team-austria-england-bruising-headache-for-gareth-southgate\">Das Team offer bruising, bothersome test on weird evening for England | Barney Ronay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the actual history, this is the point at which Gareth Southgate decides to make a quadruple substitution that has clearly been planned in advance. Off to a warm round of applause come Declan Rice and Tyrone Mings, as well as Kane and Jesse Lingard, two of the front four who managed to press Austria so effectively in their own half.</p> <p>And so for the last half-hour a disorganised new-look England get increasingly sketchy. Ben Godfrey almost passes the ball into his own net. Dominic Calvert-Lewin almost gets himself sent off. Jordan Pickford tips the ball over the bar. Ben White clears off the line. Michael Gregoritsch puts two extremely scoreable headers wide. In the end, it’s hard to disagree with the Austria defender Aleksandar Dragović when he claims that they “deserved a draw”.</p> <p>Southgate seemed largely unconcerned afterwards, putting England’s “disjointed” last half-hour down to conditioning and the volume of substitutions. But Austria also made six changes in the last half-hour and ended up looking by far the fresher and more fluent team. And perhaps you can read too much into a slightly artificial scenario in a pre-tournament friendly. Then again, this is actually part of a much longer-term trend: something strange seems to happen to England when they take the lead.</p> <p>Austria weren’t quite good enough to capitalise. But you don’t have to search very hard to find examples of games where England have gone ahead, taken off the handbrake, and been severely punished.

And as Austria gingerly gather possession and work the ball backwards, you can see Harry Kane rushing up to start the press, waving the rest of the England team forward to join the charge, which they do. After a series of tentative passes in their own half, Austria’s goalkeeper, Daniel Bachmann, is hastily forced to clear to touch, pursued by a swarm of white shirts. An hour has been played at the Riverside Stadium, and England have just gone 1-0 up. In the alternative history of Wednesday night’s game, this is the point at which England, energised by Bukayo Saka’s fine goal and the exhortations of their captain, seize the moment and with it control of the game. With Austria forced to commit numbers forward in search of an equaliser, England feast on the open spaces, tear into the middling Austrians and run out comfortable winners in front of a rocking Teesside crowd. In the actual history, this is the point at which Gareth Southgate decides to make a quadruple substitution that has clearly been planned in advance. Off to a warm round of applause come Declan Rice and Tyrone Mings, as well as Kane and Jesse Lingard, two of the front four who managed to press Austria so effectively in their own half. And so for the last half-hour a disorganised new-look England get increasingly sketchy. Ben Godfrey almost passes the ball into his own net. Dominic Calvert-Lewin almost gets himself sent off. Jordan Pickford tips the ball over the bar. Ben White clears off the line. Michael Gregoritsch puts two extremely scoreable headers wide. In the end, it’s hard to disagree with the Austria defender Aleksandar Dragović when he claims that they “deserved a draw”. Southgate seemed largely unconcerned afterwards, putting England’s “disjointed” last half-hour down to conditioning and the volume of substitutions. But Austria also made six changes in the last half-hour and ended up looking by far the fresher and more fluent team. And perhaps you can read too much into a slightly artificial scenario in a pre-tournament friendly. Then again, this is actually part of a much longer-term trend: something strange seems to happen to England when they take the lead. Austria weren’t quite good enough to capitalise. But you don’t have to search very hard to find examples of games where England have gone ahead, taken off the handbrake, and been severely punished. It’s happened nine times in the Southgate era alone: twice at the hands of Spain (at Wembley in 2016 and 2018), against Scotland at Hampden Park, against France and Italy in friendlies, against Colombia and Croatia at the last World Cup, against the Netherlands at the 2019 Nations League and the Czech Republic in a qualifying game.

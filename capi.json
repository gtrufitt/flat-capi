To be fair, twas ever thus; even when they were raking in the trophies during the imperial phase of tiki-taka, they could be extremely frustrating up front. But tonight Alvaro Morata took this charming quirk to extremes, missing a couple of big chances before hitting the bar during injury time with the best one of all. The full-backs looked good, mind, while the keeper grew in confidence, and that midfield is as pretty as ever. Portugal meanwhile will be pleased with their defensive resolve, Cristiano Ronaldo and Bruno Fernandes combined sweetly, and Renato Sanches was a magnificent force of nature. Plenty of plus points for both teams, even if the goals didn’t flow.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60ba7d358f08b9889b369361\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-04T19:22:18.010Z\">8.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">FULL TIME: Spain 0-0 Portugal</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Not a good evening for Alvaro Morata, who really should have won this for Spain on more than one occasion.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60ba7d048f082e80569f6885\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-04T19:21:23.531Z\">8.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>90 min +3:</strong> A free kick for Portugal, 40 yards out.

Sid Lowe was there in person, and he’ll be filing his report in a while, so keep them peeled for that. Thanks for reading this MBM. Nighty night! Pre-tournament friendlies are difficult to parse, especially with so many substitutions. One thing we can safely conclude, though, is that Spain would be dangerous if they had a dependable striker. To be fair, twas ever thus; even when they were raking in the trophies during the imperial phase of tiki-taka, they could be extremely frustrating up front. But tonight Alvaro Morata took this charming quirk to extremes, missing a couple of big chances before hitting the bar during injury time with the best one of all. The full-backs looked good, mind, while the keeper grew in confidence, and that midfield is as pretty as ever. Portugal meanwhile will be pleased with their defensive resolve, Cristiano Ronaldo and Bruno Fernandes combined sweetly, and Renato Sanches was a magnificent force of nature. Plenty of plus points for both teams, even if the goals didn’t flow. Not a good evening for Alvaro Morata, who really should have won this for Spain on more than one occasion. 90 min +3: A free kick for Portugal, 40 yards out. Fernandes wedges it down the middle to release Ronaldo, but he should have waited for the whistle. Take two is a non-event ... and that’s that. 90 min +1: Well, they should have! Gaya’s clearance up the left wing sends Morata clear! Easy as that! He’s onside, and one on one with Rui Patricio. He draws the keeper, and ... batters his shot off the crossbar! Another absurd miss! 90 min: There will be two added minutes. Can either of these Iberian rivals snatch it? 88 min: Koke curls the free kick towards the far post. Ferran Torres gets the vaguest flick towards the bottom right. Rui Patricio gets down well to parry clear. That’s a fine save, and it was a wonderful delivery from Koke, though Spain may wonder why one of their forwards didn’t make a stronger connection. Spain have been impotent in the final third this evening. 87 min: Gaya cuts in from the left and is sandwiched by Rafa Silva and Palhinha. Free kick, and a chance to load the Portuguese box. 86 min: The intensity drops alarmingly, much to the crowd’s displeasure. To be fair to both sides, the slew of substitutions can’t have helped. 84 min: It’s not clear how this has remained goalless. Both teams - Spain especially - have had their chances. Best not to peak before the tournament starts, huh. 82 min: ... and he’s immediately in the action, curling a long pass upfield from the left touchline and releasing Ronaldo down the middle! Ronaldo heads forward, but too strongly, and instead of striding towards goal, the ball sails through to Simon. 81 min: Nuno Mendes comes on for Guerreiro. 80 min: The other Llorente makes his way down the right but can’t quite find Morata at the near post. Then another wave of attack, and Gaya crosses dangerously from the left. Morata tries to poke home, but mistimes his run again. Spain have had their chances. 79 min: Laporte makes way for Diego Llorente. 77 min: Morata sashays down the inside-right channel and cuts back for Ferran Torres, who should score from the penalty spot but allows his unconvincing shot to be blocked by Semedo. 76 min: Ruiz makes way for Koke, while Moreno replaces Sarabia. A huge reception for Koke, Atletico’s title-winning captain. 74 min: The pace has certainly dropped. 72 min: Sarabia makes good down the left and whistles a low cross through the box. The hapless Morata had gone too early. A slightly better timed run, and that was a tap-in. 70 min: Jota and the excellent Sanches are replaced by Palhinha and Rafa Silva. 69 min: A free kick for Portugal out on the right. Fernandes takes, finding Ronaldo six yards out. Ronaldo leaps high but glances his header wide left. You’d expect him to score. 67 min: Ferran Torres glides in from the right and yanks a weak shot right. Things were opening up for him there; he should have done much better. 65 min: Simon’s footwork in the first half was nothing short of appalling; here it’s absolutely delightful, as Garcia gives him a hospital pass. With Ronaldo and Jota bearing down, he executes a perfect pullback, sending Jota off to the shops, and rolls clear. Proper bullfighting brilliance. Olé! 63 min: Spain make a triple change: Thiago, Busquets and Pau Torres off, Pedri, Rodri and Eric Garcia on. 61 min: One corner leads to another, which leads to nothing. 60 min: Now it’s Portugal’s turn to miss a sitter. Ronaldo takes on Llorente down the right, reaches the byline, and stands one up for Jota, whose header from six yards is deflected over. He should have buried that. 59 min: Portugal make a couple more changes. Carvalho and Bruno Fernandes come on for Pepe and Oliveira. Here’s Charles Antaki: “Classy stuff from Busquets, which prompts the question of the last 10+ years in the Spanish National team – if not him, then who? Koke has been in and out of the team, Saúl likewise.. if we have to get down to the Dani Ceballoses, alarm bells.” 58 min: Pepe tries to shepherd a long pass down the Spanish right out of play. Llorente doesn’t allow him to do so, stealing the ball and cutting back for Sarabia ... who scoops over an unguarded net from 12 yards! What a miss! 56 min: Spain continue to dominate possession, though haven’t created much, that Morata chance being a glowing exception. 54 min: Llorente rolls a lovely pass in from the right to tee up Morata, clear just inside the box. Morata aims for the bottom left. Fonte blocks. The ball pings back to Morata, who aims for the bottom right this time, but drags it hideously wide. He should have scored. A look of misery washes over his face. 52 min: Laporte deals with the resulting corner, heading clear. Much better, though the bar was low. 51 min: Laporte attempts a clearing volley with his right peg. A hysterical slice sails into the crowd behind. Predominantly left-footed, then. What a way that would have been to mark his international debut! 50 min: A bit of space for Morata down the inside-right channel, slipped through by Busquets. Morata bashes his shot straight at Rui Patricio. He should have made the keeper work harder, at the very least. 49 min: Morata glides down the right. Pepe again has his antenna on, and intercepts once more. The old boy’s having a good match so far. 47 min: Pepe blooters into touch. By the dugout, Spain boss Luis Enrique brings the high ball down with a silky touch, much to the delight of the paying punters. 46 min: Busquets shovels a lovely pass down the inside-left channel for Sarabia, who chests down as he cuts infield. Pepe is on hand, though, to intercept just when it looked as though Sarabia was through. Portugal get the second half underway. They’ve made the first change of the evening, swapping Joao Felix for Sporting striker Pote, who is making his international debut. “That tooth-brushing advert looks like an early David Lynch production,” writes Mary Waltz. “Creepy.” Yep, it was the first ad ever shown on British television, and it’s been non-linear narratives a-go-go ever since. The players aren’t the only ones who should do some pre-tournament prep. Ahead of the Euros, history buffs are advised to bone up on 60 years and 15 tournaments’ worth of action with Euro Summits: The Story of the European Championship by Jonathan O’Brien. Breezy yet comprehensive, fun but authoritative, think of it as a perfect companion piece for Cris Freddi’s famous Complete Book of the World Cup, and I can’t think of praise too much higher than that. Highly recommended. Just a few extra seconds of play, and that’s the end of an entertaining, occasionally feisty, first 45. 45 min: Sanchez tries to release Ronaldo down the left, but his pass is too heavy. Ronaldo tries to catch it, turning on the jets, but can’t quite reach it. He’s not completely out of juice yet. 44 min: The corner leads to nothing. 43 min: Busquets slides a crisp, first-time pass down the inside left. Ruiz steps into the box, drops a shoulder, and sees his low squirter deflected wide for a corner. 41 min: Sanches has been very impressive. He drives down the inside-right channel and thinks about shooting. He lays off to Ronaldo to his right. Ronaldo has a think himself, then pulls back for Semedo, who shows no such hesitancy, battering a wild effort miles over the bar. Ronaldo, hands on hips, wonders why he bothered. 40 min: Corner for Spain down the left. Ronaldo heads it clear. It’s been good fun, this. 39 min: Peseta for the thoughts of the deposed David de Gea. 37 min: Simon has not impressed so far. He’s already had the ball stuck past him, and was nearly closed down when faffing about with Busquets. Now here comes the worst of all. Gaya slides in to stop Sanches’s pass finding Ronaldo down the inside-right channel. The ball balloons into the air. Simon isn’t sure whether to catch or not, so opts to volley. His low hack smashes straight into Ronaldo and nearly whistles back past his lugs. He catches just in time. What a nonsense. 35 min: Now Sanches brings down Sarabia, and the crowd are baying for blood. There’s still no booking, though, and the referee gets this one absolutely right, Sanches having slipped over and accidentally cleaned his man out. 34 min: Sanches is very lucky to escape a booking as he clatters into Gaya. There might have been a couple of studs showing there, in fact. The referee makes do with a lecture. 33 min: Spain have been taking a few chances when playing out from the back. Simon and Busquets were nearly punished for over-elaborating a few minutes ago, some slapstick deemed worthy of a rerun on Spanish television. A lull, basically. 31 min: More of the pantomime booing, as Ronaldo takes possession of the ball. This is Atletico Madrid’s stadium, to be fair, he’ll be expecting it. 29 min: That was a timely attack by Spain, though, because after a slow start, Portugal were beginning to work their way into the game. A reminder how quickly they can spring forward. 27 min: A huge chance for Spain, as Morata, with the outside of his left boot, curls from the left wing, the ball dropping towards Ferran Torres at the far post. Torres should score, Pepe having been completely bypassed, but flashes his header wide right from close range. 26 min: A free kick for Portugal, the best part of 30 yards out. It’s tapped to Ronaldo, who considers belting it goalwards, but instead embarks on a dribble down a cul-de-sac. What a waste. 24 min: It was the right decision, though. Fonte was all over Pau Torres, so much so that the defender didn’t need to make any theatrical additions ... but did so anyway. 23 min: Portugal win their first corner of the game ... or rather Ruiz gifts them it. It’s hit long from the left. Fonte rises, ten yards out, and sends an unstoppable looping header over Simon and into the top left! But the whistle immediately goes for a foul. Ronaldo is livid. 21 min: Sanches takes matters into his own hands, and embarks on an elegant skitter down the inside-right channel. He nearly works his way into the box, but throws one shape too many and Pau Torres is able to block and clear. 19 min: Spain continue to stroke it around attractively, and when they don’t have it, swarm their opponents with great determination. Portugal are struggling to retain possession, and a certain forward is doing quite a lot of frowning and pointing, having seen very little of the ball. 17 min: Sarabia’s pressing forces Semedo into the clumsy concession of a corner ... but the referee points for a goal kick. More pantomime booing. 16 min: Spain have enjoyed a nice neat 75 percent of possession so far. 14 min: Oliveira clatters into Morata, having just been robbed by Thiago, an unnecessarily fierce challenge that should bring censure, but doesn’t. A kick out on the follow through. Play goes on, and Spain force the first corner of the match. Nothing comes of it, but the hosts are well on top here. 12 min: And now the reigning European champions show a bit of flash, Jota coming in from the left and wedging to the far post. A cute and clever run, but the hosts clear their lines easily enough. 10 min: Sarabia drives in from the left and one-twos with Morata. He dinks towards Llorente, preparing to slam home, six yards out. Pepe somehow contorts his body to improvise a prodded clearance. That was lovely football from the three-time European champs. 9 min: Rui Patricio takes his own sweet time over a clearance, much to the pantomime annoyance of the crowd. 8 min: Spain have established control of this game quickly. Plenty of passes in the old-school style, some tiki here, a bit of taka there. Put it together, and they’re probing with purpose down both flanks. 6 min: Jota comes in from the left and is upended unceremoniously by his Liverpool team-mate Thiago. No favours here. 5 min: Torres looks lively. He spins infield from the right and glides into the Portugal box. Fonte sticks out a leg and puts a stop to his gallop with a well-time tackle. 3 min: A long pass down the Spanish right. Ferran Torres gets on the end of it, cutting back to ... nobody in particular. But that’s a promising start for the hosts, who found the Portuguese defence wide open. 2 min: It isn’t too long before Busquets comes sliding through Danilo. Welcome to the Wanda. Spain get the party started, in front of 20,000 fans. They’re back, baby! Spain are in their furious red, while Portugal sport second-choice teal. The teams are out. Apologies for the late arrival of this MBM, we had a few technical issues to iron out. Everything’s been switched off and back on again, and here we are.

Welcome to some hot bonus MBM action, hand-crafted with precision tools to whet your appetite for the upcoming Euros. It’s a friendly between Spain and Portugal. They’re Iberian rivals, two of the best teams in the world … and the two most recent winners of the European Championship. ¡Esta encendido! Está ligado! Portugal are the reigning champions of Europe. Euro 2016 was their first-ever major title, and since then they’ve added the inaugural Nations League in 2019. The dam thus broken, there’s a fair chance they’ll retain their title, their squad including Bruno Fernandes, Joao Cancelo, Ruben Dias, Diogo Jota, Andre Silva, and, to give him his full title, 36-Year-Old Cristiano Ronaldo. If they manage it, they’ll become only the second nation to keep hold of the Coupe Henri Delaunay … Spain being the first. The Euro 2008 and Euro 2012 winners are the joint most successful country in European Championship history, also having won in 1964; fellow three-time victors Germany pip them on countback, having more runners-up finishes to their name. Few would be too surprised if they reclaim their crown next month and make it four, with a squad filled with the likes of Aymeric Laporte, Jordi Alba, Pau Torres, Sergio Ramos, Cesar Azpilicueta, Thiago, Rodri, Adama Traore and Ferran Torres. Other potential winners are available, but these are the two we’ll be watching tonight. Their last meeting was a 0-0 friendly draw in Lisbon last October; let’s hope tonight’s game is a bit more like the one before that, the sparkling 3-3 draw in Sochi at the last World Cup.

The Morrison government came under fire earlier this week when it emerged staff who tested positive at two Melbourne aged care homes had worked across multiple sites after rules preventing the practice were relaxed. A requirement for all staff in privately-run facilities managed by the federal government to declare a primary employer was reintroduced when greater Melbourne was declared a hotspot in May. But aged care workers placed into private facilities by agencies or labour hire companies remain exempt from the requirement. The exemption was first reported by Crikey. Annie Butler, the federal secretary for the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation, said staff hired through agencies made up a significant proportion of the aged care workforce. “Aged care is just a classic case study for the whole problem of insecure work,” she said. “It happens to be a workforce that we know just happens to be caring for the people who are most vulnerable to Covid.” The federal health department said single-site workforce arrangements did not apply to agency staff, contractors, or emergency workers engaged to support providers under surge workforce arrangements. “This is to ensure no facility is left without sufficient or appropriate staff,” the department said. “Single-site arrangements are part of a suite of infection prevention and control measures. Contractors, emergency workforce and agency staff should ensure they are adhering to all other requirements including PPE use, screening on entry, and notifying facilities of other sites they have worked at.” Some agencies that provide significant numbers of workers for Victorian aged care facilities are not permitting their staff to work across sites – despite being allowed to. A HealthX spokesperson said the agency placed staff for a minimum of four weeks full-time and the staff were prevented from working elsewhere during the fixed term. If staff worked at a facility with Covid-19 cases they had to complete an appropriate period of isolation or quarantine before a subsequent placement, the company said. HealthX is recording the vaccination status of its workers but could not share the number of staff who had received at least one dose for privacy reasons. Another leading Melbourne-based nursing agency did not respond to a request for comment but a person familiar with its operations said it was also preventing work across sites and was recording the vaccination status of staff. It is possible for individual workers to register with multiple agencies. Butler said she was concerned other agencies would not prevent working across sites and that the increasing “Uberisation” of the workforce – made possible by platforms such as Mable – would make it almost impossible to detect. Agency staff were relied upon as Covid-19 ravaged certain Victorian aged care facilities in 2020 and the entire permanent workforces had to evacuate. But, in some cases, this led to ill-prepared and inexperienced staff being left in charge of entire facilities with little supervision, an independent review found. “They had multiple problems, and it was because they weren’t always providing the right number of people with the right level skills,” Butler said. The union secretary said the federal government had since assembled a surge workforce that could fill that role, but she was concerned the number of nurses occupied with the vaccine rollout and testing could see agency and labour hire staff relied upon once again in a significant outbreak. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, flagged on Friday it could become mandatory for all aged care workers to be vaccinated after the federal government reached an “in-principle disposition” with the states and territories at national cabinet. “We are leaning heavily into this, make no mistake ... to see a move towards mandatory vaccination for aged care workers,” Morrison said. Sara Blunt, the chair of advocacy group Aged and Community Services Australia, said the vaccination program should have always been mandatory. She urged the government to ensure the decision did not place “unintended additional pressure” on the aged care workforce. “Even prior to compulsory vaccination of the aged care workforce, governments need to ensure good coverage of vaccination amongst workers and prioritise easy access for better protection of older residents and the wider community. “This is especially critical in Victoria but should be a priority across the nation.”","charCount":"4628","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/nino-bucci\">Nino Bucci</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/live/2021/jun/04/joe-biden-us-politics-covid-coronavirus-live-latest","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-04T20:00:06Z","webTitle":"Putin says Russia hacking claims an attempt to stir trouble before Biden summit – live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2021/jun/04/joe-biden-us-politics-covid-coronavirus-live-latest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/live/2021/jun/04/joe-biden-us-politics-covid-coronavirus-live-latest","fields":{"headline":"Putin says Russia hacking claims an attempt to stir trouble before Biden summit – live","standfirst":"<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2021/jun/04/joe-biden-us-politics-covid-coronavirus-live-latest?page=with:block-60ba52008f082e80569f65e6#block-60ba52008f082e80569f65e6\">Russian president says he expects Geneva meeting to be positive</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jun/04/facebook-donald-trump-oversight-board-instagram\">Donald Trump suspended from Facebook until 2023</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2021/jun/04/joe-biden-us-politics-covid-coronavirus-live-latest?page=with:block-60ba38298f082ac930aea4d7#block-60ba38298f082ac930aea4d7\">Christopher Wray compares hacking to post-9/11 challenge</a></li></ul>","trailText":"Russian president says he expects Geneva meeting to be positive, while Trump suspended from Facebook for two years – get the latest","byline":"Daniel Strauss in Washington","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"076a3a3532aeb79c30b9842118ee02e382446af5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/076a3a3532aeb79c30b9842118ee02e382446af5/0_35_5282_3170/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Putin said on Friday that hacking allegations which some have linked to Russia were an attempt to provoke a political dispute.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Putin said on Friday that hacking allegations which some have linked to Russia were an attempt to provoke a political dispute.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alexei Druzhinin/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<div id=\"block-60ba84448f082ac930aea9aa\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-04T20:00:06.886Z\">9.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Earlier today Reuters reported that JPMorgan &amp;

Here’s the Reuters report: JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) will resume making political donations to U.S. lawmakers but will not give to Republican members of Congress who voted to overturn President Joe Biden’s election victory, according to an internal memo on Friday seen by Reuters. The bank was among many corporations that paused political giving following the deadly Jan. 6 Capitol riots when supporters of former president Donald Trump tried to stop Congress from certifying the election. Just hours later, 147 Republicans, the vast majority of them in the House of Representatives, voted to overturn the Electoral College results which Trump falsely claimed were tainted by fraud. Following a review, the country’s largest lender will this month resume giving through its Political Action Committee (PAC) but will continue its freeze on donations to a “handful” of the 147 lawmakers whom it had previously supported, the bank said. The pause will last through the 2021-2022 election cycle, which includes November’s midterm elections, after which JPMorgan will review whether to resume contributions to the lawmakers concerned on an individual basis, it said. “This was a unique and historic moment when we believe the country needed our elected officials to put aside strongly held differences and demonstrate unity,” the bank wrote of the Jan. 6 vote to certify Biden’s win. JPMorgan noted that its PAC is an important tool for engaging in the political process in the United States. PACs are political committees organized for the purpose of raising cash to support or in some cases oppose election candidates. Meanwhile, CNBC’s Brian Schwartz got his hands on a memo from CitiGroup memo announcing a slightly different approach. We have a new readout of conversations between Senator Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, the lead Republican negotiator on an infrastructure deal, and Joe Biden. The statement is very brief, even for these usually anodyne readouts. Conspicuously, there’s no line saying that Capito is encouraged or any progress has been made (as there have been in other statements). On the other hand, the statement does say the two lawmakers will talk again on Monday so it’s not over yet. We have more details emerging of Joe Biden’s schedule on his European trip which includes the G7 and meetings with Russian president Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan of Turkey. Donald Trump is fuming over Facebook’s announcement that he would be suspended from the social media platform for the next two years. My colleague Julie Carrie Wong has written a report on Facebook’s announcement: At the end of the suspension period, Facebook said, it would work with experts to assess the risk to public safety posed by reinstating Trump’s account. “We will evaluate external factors, including instances of violence, restrictions on peaceful assembly and other markers of civil unrest,” Clegg wrote. “If we determine that there is still a serious risk to public safety, we will extend the restriction for a set period of time and continue to re-evaluate until that risk has receded.” The White House media briefing is underway and press secretary Jen Psaki has reiterated that Joe Biden intends to raise the problems of cyber attacks on US entities with Vladimir Putin when he meets with the Russian president during his visit to the UK and the European Union later this month. Biden views increasingly frequent ransomware attacks to be a “rising national security concern,” she said. Psaki just said: “We want to move towards a more stable and predictable relationship with Russia” and pledged that Biden is “never one to hold back on areas where Russian action is hurting the US”. Recent cyber attacks, including ransomware hacks, on US government and commercial computer systems are not known to be run by the Russian government but are carried out by cyber criminal gangs that are based in Russia or Russian-controlled territories and are tolerated by the authorities in Moscow. “We know that the ransomware threat is urgent,” Psaki said. Biden plans to confront Putin when he meets with him in Geneva on June 16. Biden is attending G7 talks in the UK followed by a NATO summit on the Continent. A little earlier, Psaki said Biden will raise a number of issues with Putin, such as human rights and Russian aggression at the Ukraine border. “He also will raise cyber activity, malign activity, problematic activity, harmful activity that we’ve seen take place. There is the Solar Winds hack but also the ransomware hacks that we’ve talked about. “The actions of criminal groups within a country, there is a responsibility on the leaders of that country to take action and there’s no doubt that President Biden will be addressing that directly in that conversation.” Psaki added that the increasing problem has prompted a “rapid review” of cyber security that is underway by the US government. Donald Trump has responded to Facebook’s decision that his suspension from the social media platform will, initially, last for two years. And, in a parallel universe, the former US president mysteriously refers to some election somewhere with which this outlet is unfamiliar. The election we’re familiar with is this one: We’re waiting for a press briefing at the White House by Jen Psaki, but for the moment, let us bring you a summary of the main events so far today. Facebook has announced that Donald Trump will continue to be suspended from the social media platform for two years and will only be reinstated “if conditions permit”. Russian president Vladimir Putin issued a warning today: ransomware hacking allegations from the United States are a deliberate attempt to provoke a confrontation between the US and Russia. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Christopher Wray, the director of the FBI, compared the recent spate of ransomware attacks to the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center. Joe Biden is continuing talks with the Republican side today in an attempt to win bipartisan agreement on key legislative pieces stuck in Congress. Facebook has announced that Donald Trump will continue to be suspended from the social media platform for two years and will only be reinstated “if conditions permit”. Today’s decision comes just weeks after input from the Facebook oversight board – an independent advisory committee of academics, media figures and former politicians – who recommended in early May that Trump’s account not be reinstated. However the oversight board punted the ultimate decision on Trump’s fate back to Facebook itself, giving the company six months to make the final call. The former president has been suspended since January, following the deadly Capitol attack that saw a mob of Trump supporters storm Congress in an attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. The company suspended Trump’s Facebook and Instagram accounts over posts in which he appeared to praise the actions of the rioters, saying that his actions posed too great a risk to remain on the platform. Following the Capitol riot, Trump was suspended from several major tech platforms, including Twitter, YouTube and Snapchat. Twitter has since made its ban permanent. We’ll bring you more reaction and developments but you can also follow the full story as it unfolds here. Here’s a link to the decision as issued by Facebook itself. And here’s the column from last month from former Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger, who is a member of the oversight board that upheld FB’s ban, #ICYMI. Russian president Vladimir Putin issued a warning Friday: hacking allegations from the United States are a deliberate attempt to provoke a confrontation with the United States, per Reuters: President Vladimir Putin said on Friday that hacking allegations which some have linked to Russia were an attempt to provoke a political dispute ahead of a summit with US President Joe Biden on June 16, Interfax news agency reported. He also said that he expected his summit with Biden, which is set to take place in Geneva, to be held in a positive atmosphere, though he anticipated no breakthrough. Tensions between the two countries have been simmering for some time. Recall that in April the Biden administration issued new sanctions against Russia over cyberespionage: The Biden administration on Thursday announced sanctions against Russia for its involvement in a recent major cyber espionage operation against the US, foreign influence operations around US elections and other concerns. As part of an executive order signed by President Biden, the administration through the Treasury Department will block US financial institutions from purchasing bonds from Russia’s Central Bank, National Wealth Fund or Ministry of Finance after June 14 and from lending funds to these institutions. The directive also leaves open the possibility for the administration to expand the sanctions on Russian sovereign debt. Additionally, the Biden administration is expelling 10 personnel from the Russian diplomatic mission in Washington, some of whom US officials say are representatives of Russian intelligence services. One of the more crucial policy points for Joe Biden during his trip to meet with G7 leaders will be over a global minimum tax CNN has more. CNN’s Julia Horowitz explained the dynamics: The Biden administration’s ambitious plan to overhaul the global tax system is about to face a crucial test. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen heads to a meeting of Group of Seven finance ministers in London on Friday and Saturday looking to build support from many of the world’s top economies — an important step in the administration’s efforts to rewrite international tax rules and discourage American companies from booking earnings abroad. G7 finance ministers are expected to back the US plan during the summit, according to a Reuters report citing a US Treasury official. Washington’s proposal will likely get a full endorsement when G7 leaders including President Joe Biden gather in the United Kingdom next week, the news agency reported. Last month, the US Treasury proposed a global minimum tax of at least 15%, aiming to tackle an unwieldy international system rife with loopholes. Establishing a minimum rate could help discourage companies from shifting their profits to countries where they would pay less tax. More and more Republicans have been calling for Dr. Anthony Fauci’s resignation, citing a trove of emails recently released to the public. Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri released one such statement this morning. It’s unlikely Fauci will resign or that Joe Biden will ask for Fauci’s resignation though. He said today he still is “very confident” in the chief medical adviser to the president. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Christopher Wray, the director of the FBI, compared the recent spate of ransomware attacks to the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center. Here’s his comments in the Journal: FBI Director Christopher Wray said the agency is investigating about 100 different types of ransomware, many of which trace back to hackers in Russia, and compared the current spate of cyberattacks with the challenge posed by the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. “There are a lot of parallels, there’s a lot of importance, and a lot of focus by us on disruption and prevention,” Mr. Wray said in an interview on Thursday. “There’s a shared responsibility, not just across government agencies but across the private sector and even the average American.” Mr. Wray’s comments—among his first publicly since two recent ransomware attacks gripped the U.S. meat and oil-and-gas industries—come as senior Biden administration officials have characterized ransomware as an urgent national-security threat and said they are looking at ways to disrupt the criminal ecosystem that supports the booming industry. Each of the 100 different malicious software variants are responsible for multiple ransomware attacks in the U.S., Mr. Wray said. Cyberattacks are something the president plans to bring up when he meets with Russian president Vladimir Putin. Earlier this week Biden told reporters that his administration is looking “closely” at possibly retaliating against Russia over ransomware attacks. “Responsible states do not harbor ransomware criminals,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said recently. The Texas Tribune throws out the possibility that Allen West could be gearing up to challenge incumbent governor Greg Abbott, a Republican. Here’s the Tribune: West has not ruled out challenging Gov. Greg Abbott, and he has also had tension recently with Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick. A former Florida congressman who moved to Texas several years ago, West took over the party last summer, unseating incumbent James Dickey. He quickly made a name for himself for his willingness to speak out against fellow Republicans, including Abbott, whose coronavirus response he criticized. West used the latest legislative session to push hard for the party’s eight legislative priorities, and he has spent recent days lamenting the lack of progress that lawmakers have to show on them. It’s important to note that Abbott is a popular politician in Texas and has recently touted Donald Trump’s endorsement. He also won his last gubernatorial election by 13 percentage points. Unseating Abbott would not be easy. The jobs report numbers out today were overall positive. My colleague Dominic Rushe has more: The US added 559,000 jobs in May as the coronavirus pandemic receded, shaking off fears of a substantial slowdown in hiring after April’s disappointing monthly report. The Bureau of Labor Statistics said Friday that the unemployment rate had fallen to 5.8% from 6.1% in April, still significantly higher than the 3.8% unemployment rate recorded in February 2020 before Covid 19 hit the US but less than half its 14.8% peak in April last year. The news comes one month after the labor department shocked economists by announcing the US had added just 266,000 new jobs in April – far below the 1m gain that had been expected. April’s report led to sparring between the Biden administration and Republicans who claimed higher levels of unemployment benefits were keeping people from returning to work. There are signs of a strong rebound across the US economy. Worker filings for unemployment benefits have dropped by 35% since late April and fell to a pandemic low of 385,000 last week, the labor department said Thursday. Former congressman Allen West, the ex-Florida member of Congress-turned chairman of the Texas Republican Party, is stepping down from his post. He had been leading the Texas Republican Party for less than a year, a short tenure for a chairman to abruptly end. There seems to be some confusion about the timing of when his departure will go into effect. While the vice chair of the party tweeted that West is stepping down at 5pm. today the party’s communications director tweeted that West will keep his job until early July. Here’s a press release announcing West’s departure. Good morning readers, Daniel Strauss here. Let’s get started.

It has also been widely reported this week that Trump believes he will be reinstated in the presidency by August. He will not. But in his statement on Friday he did not say if he thought he would return to the White House because he would be reinstated or because he would run for the Republican nomination again and then defeat Joe Biden or another Democrat. Trump’s statement read: “Next time I’m in the White House there will be no more dinners, at his request, with Mark Zuckerberg and his wife. It will be all business!” Trump has a history of using public statements to troll his opponents and a long record of lies and exaggerations and promoting baseless conspiracy theories. At the same time Trump has maintained a strong grip on the Republican party and there is intense speculation about whether or not he would run for the presidency again. Nick Clegg, the former British deputy prime minister who is now Facebook’s vice-president of global affairs, announced the social media website’s ban on Trump until 2023. It follows the recommendation of Facebook’s oversight board. Trump has been suspended from the social media site since January, when he incited supporters to attack the US Capitol in service of his lie that his defeat by Joe Biden was the result of electoral fraud. In a first statement on the suspension, Trump said it was an “insult” to those who voted for him in “the rigged presidential election” and said: “They shouldn’t be allowed to get away with this censoring and silencing.” Amid striking polling about support for his lies among Republican voters, Trump still dominates polls of possible contenders for the party’s nomination in 2024. Trump appears to be convincing himself the election was stolen and that some mechanism exists by which he might be reinstated, a belief apparently stoked by Mike Lindell, the chief executive of MyPillow and a hardline Trump supporter. According to CNN, which confirmed reporting by Maggie Haberman of the New York Times and by the conservative National Review, Trump has asked advisers: “What do you think of this theory?” A source also told CNN: “People have told him that it’s not true.”","charCount":"2409","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/martin-pengelly\">Martin Pengelly</a> in New York"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2021/jun/04/somerset-v-hampshire-glamorgan-v-yorkshire-and-more-county-cricket-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-04T19:18:12Z","webTitle":"Glamorgan close on win over Lancs: county cricket – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2021/jun/04/somerset-v-hampshire-glamorgan-v-yorkshire-and-more-county-cricket-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2021/jun/04/somerset-v-hampshire-glamorgan-v-yorkshire-and-more-county-cricket-live","fields":{"headline":"Glamorgan close on win over Lancs: county cricket – as it happened","standfirst":"<p>Glamorgan need another 51 runs to seal victory in a low-scoring game while Yorkshire and Hampshire both rallied from unsteady starts</p>","trailText":"Glamorgan need another 51 runs to seal victory in a low-scoring game while Yorkshire and Hampshire both rallied from unsteady starts","byline":"Tanya Aldred","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"df1aca69acf5d9e16b9433b0c159088eb6da0401\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df1aca69acf5d9e16b9433b0c159088eb6da0401/0_132_3613_2169/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Roelof van der Merwe of Somerset looks to make his ground as Ian Holland of Hampshire kicks the ball towards the stumps. \" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roelof van der Merwe of Somerset looks to make his ground as Ian Holland of Hampshire kicks the ball towards the stumps. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Harry Trump/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<div id=\"block-60ba7ae08f082ac930aea942\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-04T19:18:12.460Z\">8.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Roundup</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A gripping finale to the low-scoring game at Sophia Gardens bubbled up as <strong>Glamorgan</strong> chased 188 to beat <strong>Lancashire</strong>. With Saqib Mahmood straining every sinew and Matt Parkinson twirling with intent, conditions were challenging. </p> <p>Joe Cooke and David Lloyd gave Glamorgan a promising start, Cooke bringing up the 50 stand with a six over square leg, before slamming Parkinson’s second ball for four. But he was caught off Parkinson shortly afterwards, and soon Lloyd and Billy Root followed. </p> <p>Much rests on the staying power of Marnus Labuschagne, 32 not out overnight, with 51 needed. Earlier, Lancashire were bundled out for 164 in their second innings, with only Alex Davies’ 47 troubling the scorers. Michael Neser snaffled 4-53.</p> <p><strong>Hampshire</strong> recovered from a precarious 31-3 to creep towards parity at Taunton. They were rescued by a patient 67 from Sam Northeast and a sprightly 91 not out from Lewis McManus, moving to 285-7 at stumps, still 75 runs behind <strong>Somerset</strong>.</p> <p><strong>Warwickshire</strong> chose not to enforce the follow-on against <strong>Derbyshire</strong> and hit stormy waters at 18 for 3. Tom Hain helped negotiate safe harbour before a clatter of evening wickets. Top-class bowling from Craig Miles (5-30) and Liam Norwell (4-24) had demolished Derbyshire’s first innings as they flopped to 121 all out.</p> <p>David Bedingham’s 121 guided <strong>Durham</strong> to a substantial first-innings lead at New Road. <strong>Worcestershire</strong> were batting again by tea and lost early wickets to Matthew Potts, despite fifty from Jake Libby.</p> <p>Dawid Malan sparkled to a wonderful century in his first appearance of the summer, as he and Gary Ballance pushed <strong>Yorkshire</strong> into prime position at Headingley with an unbeaten partnership of 187. Ben Coad had earlier dismissed both Thursday’s heroes: Ben Brown for 127 and 16-year-old Dan Ibrahim, who became the youngest man to ever make 50 on debut in the Championship. Bilal Shafayat was the previous record-holder.<strong> Sussex</strong> then lost their last three wickets for three runs. </p> <p>Callum Parkinson, the twin brother of Lancashire’s Matt, grabbed five wickets with his slow left-arm as <strong>Leicestershire</strong> ran through a demoralised <strong>Gloucestershire</strong> on a turning pitch. Parkinson’s first five-fer of the season demolished the top order, with only Miles Hammond with 67 providing any resistance. He then snaffled the first wicket of the Gloucs follow-on in the last over of the day, as they fight to avoid a second consecutive defeat.</p> <p>There was no play at Chelmsford or Canterbury as the rain that spoilt the Test spread its tentacles over the south-east.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60ba7a2d8f08b9889b369340\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-04T19:11:04.948Z\">8.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Close of play scores</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Group one</strong></p> <p>Derby: Derbyshire 121 v Warwicks 274 and 132-7; Warks lead by 286</p> <p>Chelmsford: Essex v Notts 248-6 <em>no play today, rain</em></p> <p>Worcester: Worcestershire 131 and 99-3 v Durham 381 all out; Worcs trail by 151 runs</p> <p><strong>Group two</strong></p> <p>Grace Road: Leicestershire 451 v Gloucestershire 158 and 5-1</p> <p>Taunton: Somerset 360 all out v Hampshire 285-7</p> <p><strong>Group three</strong></p> <p>Cardiff: Glamorgan 150 and 137-3 v Lancashire 173 and 164; Glamorgan need 51 to win</p> <p>Canterbury: Kent v Northamptonshire 362-5 <em>no play today, rain</em></p> <p>Headingley: Yorkshire 272-2 v Sussex 313 all out; Yorks trail by 41 runs</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60ba62fa8f08b9889b3691db\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-04T17:33:59.982Z\">6.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Just popping back between editions</strong> to say it’s very tight at Sophia Gardens, and Worcestershire are looking vulnerable at New Road despite the best efforts of Jake Libby.

By stumps, less so, thanks to a smashing unbeaten 126 from Ben Brown, 40 from Aaron Thomason and a cameo of 37 from 16-year-old Danial Ibrahim.</p> <p>Brown played with nimble feet and hands, running swiftly between the wickets and driving with panache, picking the gaps ably, like a pick-happy man with an orange pith obsession. Ibrahim was sighingly calm, straight drive here, flick there, making the most of late-afternoon Yorkshire bowling with the new ball that touched on the wayward.</p> <p><strong>Northamptonshire</strong>, the gluttons, bolted down four batting points before the close in a riotous day’s batting against <strong>Kent</strong>. Ricardo Vasconcelos and Emilio Gay put on 135 for the first wicket, before Gay, who made his maiden first-class century, and Luke Procter added 100 for the second. Darren Stevens, aged 45, picked up a couple of wickets with the second new ball to lead a mini-revival at the close.</p> <p>There were two catches for Kent’s wicketkeeper Ollie Robinson, who received an apology from Kent Online, who had mistakenly pictured him in Wednesday’s story about the other Ollie Robinson.</p> <p><strong>Lancashire</strong> were squirrelled out by <strong>Glamorgan</strong> for 173 after a succession of batsmen got in, but then got out again, without adding greatly to the score. Tom Bailey scored a quickfire 31 to raise spirits, before picking up three wickets, as did Sajid Mahmood, as Glamorgan collapsed to 150 for nine.</p> <p><strong>Somerset </strong>unveiled their usual back-to-front batting style against <strong>Hampshire</strong>, reeling at 43 for five, laughing at stumps, 360 all out. Keith Barker grabbed six for 72, picking off the Somerset top order – none who passed double figures apart from Steven Davies. The rearguard started with 45 from Tom Banton, and was bolstered by an eighth wicket stand of 171 between Lewis Gregory (107) and Roelof van der Merwe (88).</p> <p>Marcus Harris plundered 148, his second century in succession, put <strong>Leicestershire</strong> in a happy position against <strong>Gloucestershire</strong>. They ended the day at 357 for five.</p> <p><strong>Worcestershire</strong> crumbled for 131 at New Road as Brydon Carse and Matty Potts snaffled four wickets each. <strong>Durham </strong>ended the day leading by nine with six wickets in hand, bolstered by 52 from Alex Lees.</p> <p>Fifties from Lyndon James, Steven Mullaney and Joe Clarke, who restarted his innings after retiring hurt, inched <strong>Nottinghamshire</strong> on to the front foot against <strong>Essex</strong>. Peter Siddle finished with three for 76.</p> <p>Sam Hain (77) and Michael Burgess (71) kept <strong>Warwickshire </strong>afloat on a muggy day at <strong>Derbyshire</strong>. Sam Conners had the top order in a pickle, taking the first four wickets, before the middle-order solidified to see them towards 272 for nine at stumps.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60b9f48f8f082ac930ae9fd3\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-04T09:38:32.733Z\">10.38am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Scores on the doors</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p> <strong>Group one</strong></p> <p>Derby: Derbyshire v Warwicks 272-9</p> <p>Chelmsford: Essex v Notts 248-6 </p> <p>Worcester: Worcester 131 all out v Durham 140-4</p> <p><strong>Group two</strong></p> <p>Grace Road: Leicestershire 357-5 v Gloucestershire</p> <p>Taunton: Somerset 360 all out v Hampshire </p> <p><strong>Group three</strong></p> <p>Sophia Gardens: Glamorgan 150-9 v Lancashire 173 all out</p> <p>Canterbury: Kent v Northamptonshire 362-5</p> <p>Headingley: Yorkshire v Sussex 267-5</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60b9f3cb8f082e80569f5ed0\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-04T09:38:12.828Z\">10.38am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Good morning!

With Saqib Mahmood straining every sinew and Matt Parkinson twirling with intent, conditions were challenging. Joe Cooke and David Lloyd gave Glamorgan a promising start, Cooke bringing up the 50 stand with a six over square leg, before slamming Parkinson’s second ball for four. But he was caught off Parkinson shortly afterwards, and soon Lloyd and Billy Root followed. Much rests on the staying power of Marnus Labuschagne, 32 not out overnight, with 51 needed. Earlier, Lancashire were bundled out for 164 in their second innings, with only Alex Davies’ 47 troubling the scorers. Michael Neser snaffled 4-53. Hampshire recovered from a precarious 31-3 to creep towards parity at Taunton. They were rescued by a patient 67 from Sam Northeast and a sprightly 91 not out from Lewis McManus, moving to 285-7 at stumps, still 75 runs behind Somerset. Warwickshire chose not to enforce the follow-on against Derbyshire and hit stormy waters at 18 for 3. Tom Hain helped negotiate safe harbour before a clatter of evening wickets. Top-class bowling from Craig Miles (5-30) and Liam Norwell (4-24) had demolished Derbyshire’s first innings as they flopped to 121 all out. David Bedingham’s 121 guided Durham to a substantial first-innings lead at New Road. Worcestershire were batting again by tea and lost early wickets to Matthew Potts, despite fifty from Jake Libby. Dawid Malan sparkled to a wonderful century in his first appearance of the summer, as he and Gary Ballance pushed Yorkshire into prime position at Headingley with an unbeaten partnership of 187. Ben Coad had earlier dismissed both Thursday’s heroes: Ben Brown for 127 and 16-year-old Dan Ibrahim, who became the youngest man to ever make 50 on debut in the Championship. Bilal Shafayat was the previous record-holder. Sussex then lost their last three wickets for three runs. Callum Parkinson, the twin brother of Lancashire’s Matt, grabbed five wickets with his slow left-arm as Leicestershire ran through a demoralised Gloucestershire on a turning pitch. Parkinson’s first five-fer of the season demolished the top order, with only Miles Hammond with 67 providing any resistance. He then snaffled the first wicket of the Gloucs follow-on in the last over of the day, as they fight to avoid a second consecutive defeat. There was no play at Chelmsford or Canterbury as the rain that spoilt the Test spread its tentacles over the south-east. Group one Derby: Derbyshire 121 v Warwicks 274 and 132-7; Warks lead by 286 Chelmsford: Essex v Notts 248-6 no play today, rain Worcester: Worcestershire 131 and 99-3 v Durham 381 all out; Worcs trail by 151 runs Group two Grace Road: Leicestershire 451 v Gloucestershire 158 and 5-1 Taunton: Somerset 360 all out v Hampshire 285-7 Group three Cardiff: Glamorgan 150 and 137-3 v Lancashire 173 and 164; Glamorgan need 51 to win Canterbury: Kent v Northamptonshire 362-5 no play today, rain Headingley: Yorkshire 272-2 v Sussex 313 all out; Yorks trail by 41 runs Just popping back between editions to say it’s very tight at Sophia Gardens, and Worcestershire are looking vulnerable at New Road despite the best efforts of Jake Libby. Well batted Dawid Malan, well batted Gary Ballance, making it look easy at Headingley, and a hero-gram for six-wicket Callum Parkinson. That’s it from me for today, Graham will be here tomorrow at Headingley. Good night! 98 overs due tomorrow. I’d better concentrate on the round-up for a bit, I’ll leave you with Glamorgan strolling to 43 without loss, needing another 145 to beat Lancashire. Fifties for Miles Hammond at Gloucestershire 58 not out, and for Dawid Malan at Headingley, where he and Gary Ballance have put on 81 for the third wicket. Yorks 176-2 Durham all out 381. They’re becoming batting specialists. Tongue 4-73. Worcester, I’m afraid, are in deep trouble needing 251 to make Durham bat again. I haven’t been watching at New Road - has the pitch changed from the minefield it was on Thursday (at least in Worcester’s mind.) Does anyone know why the flush isn’t working? I suppose I better go and find out. In other news, Glamorgan are 25-0, a couple of fours each for Cooke and Lloyd. Group one Derby: Derbyshire 121 v Warwicks 274 and 26-3 Chelmsford: Essex v Notts 248-6 no play today, rain Worcester: Worcester 131 all out v Durham 369-9 Group two Grace Road: Leicestershire 451 v Gloucestershire 85-2 Taunton: Somerset 360 all out v Hampshire 157-6 Group three Sophia Gardens: Glamorgan and 0-0 v Lancashire 173 and 164 Glamorgan need 188 to win Canterbury: Kent v Northamptonshire 362-5 no play today, rain Headingley: Yorkshire 153-2 v Sussex 313 all out Rain, rain and more rain at Chelmsford, with large puddles developing at the River End. Essex need the points more than group-leaders Notts. Sam Northeast has gone at Taunton for a hard-working 67 as Tom Abell makes a crucial breakthrough. Hampshire continue to edge forward, just 206 behind. They’ve taken tea at Sophia Gardens, with the promise of an entertaining run-chase to toast day. Invaluable nurdling from Saqib Mahmood and Danny Lamb at the end. Neser 4-53, two each for Lamb and Douthwaite. Northants knew what they were up to yesterday, banging out four bonus points while the sun shone. Pennington back in the wickets at New Road, with numbers 7 and 9. Durham lead by 219. Warwickshire are a-crumbling in their second innings. Currently 5-2 after four overs, with Pieter Malan and Will Rhodes’s afternoon closed. The lead 159. Teenage kicks: Yorkshire 130-2. Follow on NOT enforced by Warwickshire, who bat again with a first-innings lead of 153. Meanwhile Sam Northeast has tacked together a valuable fifty at Taunton, paying what I think they described as a “holding-role” in football. Hampshire 124-5. Not many centuries this round (Brown, Harris and Bedingham, I think), but another beauty from Bedingham who is providing welcome heft to the Durham middle order. The lead over Worcestershire now 202. The last wicket stand added a sixth of the runs after a collapse of 8-45. Norwell 4-24, Miles 5-30. Will they follow on? We wait.... Still no play at Kent, Chelmsford or Lord’s. For balance, the top ten leading wicket-takers this season: Rushworth (Durham) 37 Coverton (Somerset) 36 Fletcher (Notts) 36 Abbott (Hants) 34 Harmer (Esses) 34 Higgins (Gloucs) 33 Sam Cook (Essex) 32 Carse (Durham) 32 Olly Robinson (Sussex) 29 Bamber (Middx) 28 [Broad has 19 from four games, Wood 10 from three games, Anderson 3 in two games but one innings] Hampshire 110-5, as James Hildreth at slip says thank you to a softly-dropping plum from Liam Dawson. Ah! Thank you Gary. O youth! The strength of it, the faith of it, the imagination of it! Ibrahim strikes with ball. Kohler-Cadmore lbw for 25. Yorkshire 83-1. Like a moonlit shadow, Derbyshire dance where Lancashire tread. From 76-2 to 98-7. Craig Miles 4-26, Norwell 2-20. A breakthrough at Taunton! James Vince is caught at backward point after an uncharacteristically patient 29. Hampshire 100-4. I’ve learnt that Dan Ibrahim is now the youngest player to make fifty on debut in the Championship. The previous record was held by Bilal Shafayat - who in my mind played a Test for England, but my mind is wrong. Cricinfo confirms U19 England caps and a glorious season in 2005 when he made 1000 runs for Notts. Gosh Lancashire really are, um, getting a move on. They’ve now lost 5-11, with Vilas and Bailey joining the heavy pavilion-trudge. Three for Neser, one for Douthwaite and a run out. Currently, 125-8, a lead of 148. That run-out : And a reminder of the owner of that mellifluous welsh voice: Eddie Bevan of course. Thank you! Hopes of a tea-start at Lord’s Glamorgan’s statement on welcoming fans back to Sophia Gardens: We welcome today’s announcement from the Welsh Government of a return of spectators to watch live events in Wales this summer. The two metre social distancing regulation will restrict our capacity to a maximum of 2,892 and we will continue to work closely with key partners including the Welsh Government, Public Health Wales, and Cardiff City Council on a safe return of fans to Sophia Gardens. We have prepared and submitted proposals for a phased return of fans to Sophia Gardens from next week and look forward to providing more information as soon as the necessary approvals have been confirmed. Once again, we would like to thank our members, fans and partners for their patience and look forward to welcoming supporters back to Sophia Gardens in greater numbers. Gary Naylor confirms a Lancs-up in progress. Here’s the first of the three to fall since lunch: A post-lunch trickle: Madsen and McDermot shot out by Miles (3-23) at Derby: 82-4, 192 behind Warwicks. Chris Wright picked off by Hammond at the run-fest at Grace Road, Leicestershire 439-8. Oh dear, and Lancashire have lost 3-4 at Sophia Gardens: Bohannon, Livingstone, and Wood run-out without facing a ball. Lancs 113-6. Just watered the garden for the first-time in a while, cautiously optimistic about the soft-fruit season. Talking of which... ah, no-one has collapsed in the ten minutes since lunch. Group one Derby: Derbyshire 61-2 v Warwicks 274 Chelmsford: Essex v Notts 248-6 no play before lunch Worcester: Worcester 131 all out v Durham 252-4 Group two Grace Road: Leicestershire 436-7 v Gloucestershire Taunton: Somerset 360 all out v Hampshire 67-3 Group three Sophia Gardens: Glamorgan 150 all out v Lancashire 173 and 88-3 Canterbury: Kent v Northamptonshire 362-5 no play before lunch Headingley: Yorkshire 26-0 v Sussex 313 all out Godleman straggles back to the Derby pavilion after being caught behind for 32. Derby 61-2 shortly before lunch. At Headingley, the Yorkshire openers are still whole, if with an uneven scorecard. Kohler Cadmore one not out; Lyth 16 not out including a morning heave-ho for six! Yorks 22-0. David Bedingham is the only man with more than 700 runs this season - and still he bats. Currently 65 not out at New Road as Durham sail into a sobering lead: 241-4, a lead of 112 over Worcestershire. Al Davies and Luke Wells steaming along at Sophia Gardens, but Keaton Jennings’ more circumspect innings is over. Lbw to Weighell for 12. A bump down to earth in this game after his classy hundred last week. Lancashire 72- hang on, they’re now 72-2. Wells bowled for 26 by Douthwaite. Sussex all out 313! Now Yorkshire get a go. Will it be the Yorkshire of the first innings of the Roses match -159 all out - or the Yorkshire who battled to so-close to the bitter end in the second innings? This is just showing off! Gloucestershire having a spell in the doldrums. Leicester now 411-7, with a helpful 47 extras. And, in case this appeals: No dream debut for Ibrahim, but dreamy enough. Well played, young pup. Sussex 310-8. Lunch will be taken at 1pm at Lord’s, where the rain continues to pour. Hampshire, meanwhile, are in trouble: 31-3 after de Lange removes Steel and Alsop in one over. Holland already gone, caught VDM off Davey. Just perusing the Championship averages as if it was 1985 and they were taking up a whole page in the Telegraph. The highest England players are 7th placed Ollie Pope (78.83) and 8th placed Rory Burns (53.73) Top ten: Van der Merwe, Somerset Bedingham, Durham Carlson, Glamorgan RS Patel, Surrey MS Harris, Leicestershire Vasconcelos, Northants Pope, Surrey Burns, Surrey MAH Hammond, Gloucestershire Abell, Somerset Derbyshire have lost their first wicket, 8-1, but Durham billow onwards, Beingham and Jones steadfast in a partnership of fifty. Their lead over Worcestershire an almost commanding 53, with six wickets remaining. The lovely voice of the Glamorgan commentator is lulling me into a trance, but can report that at Derby Warwickshire are all out for 274, an impressive effort by Derby, who are already batting and 7-0. There will be an inspection at Canterbury at 12.20. How’s that on debut?! Seven fours and as calm as a tarn on an early spring morning. Ticket offer!!! Brian Withington has very kindly offered two free tickets for England v New Zealand at Edgbaston next Friday June 11th to a lucky BTL-er. If you are interested, please email me at tanya.aldred.freelance@theguardian.com and I can put the two of you in touch. There is a Covid consent form that should be completed ASAP and a lateral flow test requirement as condition of entry. An email wafts in with the jasmine. It’s from Finbar Anslow: “Hello Tanya, Just wanted to let you know how wonderful my yesterday was. Cutting the grass and only stopping to check scores when I found a bit of shade (memo, plant more trees) So lovely to watch Lewis Gregory score a ton and the Marchant of menace in action. However even in paradisiacal Piedmont the occasional question flutters through one’s thoughtless contemplation........Why is Reina del Cid’s Harvest moon so damned good?Was Edward Snowden right? Is there a file on each and every one of us, just awaiting a moment of fame for our sins to be exposed.Should Somerset send their bowlers in to open the batting? Any enlightenment gratefully received At Headingley, Ben Coad grabs Sussex’s main man, centurion Ben Brown. Sussex 275-6 with 16-year -old Ibrahim not out 43. He’s “doing a Conway.” Lancashire not hanging around. This could be all over today at the Gardens. Jennings and Davies march back out, Davies is off the mark with four and Lancashire are 6-0, with a first-innings lead of 23. And Ali’s nice report on Conway, Wood, Robinson, Root and co And Simon Burnton on the fallout from the Robinson affair. We’re rolling! Except at Canterbury, Chelmsford and Lord’s where the rain doth spout and spoil things. Some fabulous reading from the Test. I thought this was brilliant on Ollie Robinson by Andy Bull. On a morning of cloud cover so heavy that the Headingley floodlights were switched on, and 2,056 souls planted their behinds around the ground for the first time for a men’s county game since 2019, Yorkshire chose to bowl. With Sussex 68 for four just after lunch, it seemed a good decision. By stumps, less so, thanks to a smashing unbeaten 126 from Ben Brown, 40 from Aaron Thomason and a cameo of 37 from 16-year-old Danial Ibrahim. Brown played with nimble feet and hands, running swiftly between the wickets and driving with panache, picking the gaps ably, like a pick-happy man with an orange pith obsession. Ibrahim was sighingly calm, straight drive here, flick there, making the most of late-afternoon Yorkshire bowling with the new ball that touched on the wayward. Northamptonshire, the gluttons, bolted down four batting points before the close in a riotous day’s batting against Kent. Ricardo Vasconcelos and Emilio Gay put on 135 for the first wicket, before Gay, who made his maiden first-class century, and Luke Procter added 100 for the second. Darren Stevens, aged 45, picked up a couple of wickets with the second new ball to lead a mini-revival at the close. There were two catches for Kent’s wicketkeeper Ollie Robinson, who received an apology from Kent Online, who had mistakenly pictured him in Wednesday’s story about the other Ollie Robinson. Lancashire were squirrelled out by Glamorgan for 173 after a succession of batsmen got in, but then got out again, without adding greatly to the score. Tom Bailey scored a quickfire 31 to raise spirits, before picking up three wickets, as did Sajid Mahmood, as Glamorgan collapsed to 150 for nine. Somerset unveiled their usual back-to-front batting style against Hampshire, reeling at 43 for five, laughing at stumps, 360 all out. Keith Barker grabbed six for 72, picking off the Somerset top order – none who passed double figures apart from Steven Davies. The rearguard started with 45 from Tom Banton, and was bolstered by an eighth wicket stand of 171 between Lewis Gregory (107) and Roelof van der Merwe (88). Marcus Harris plundered 148, his second century in succession, put Leicestershire in a happy position against Gloucestershire. They ended the day at 357 for five. Worcestershire crumbled for 131 at New Road as Brydon Carse and Matty Potts snaffled four wickets each. Durham ended the day leading by nine with six wickets in hand, bolstered by 52 from Alex Lees. Fifties from Lyndon James, Steven Mullaney and Joe Clarke, who restarted his innings after retiring hurt, inched Nottinghamshire on to the front foot against Essex. Peter Siddle finished with three for 76. Sam Hain (77) and Michael Burgess (71) kept Warwickshire afloat on a muggy day at Derbyshire. Sam Conners had the top order in a pickle, taking the first four wickets, before the middle-order solidified to see them towards 272 for nine at stumps. Group one Derby: Derbyshire v Warwicks 272-9 Chelmsford: Essex v Notts 248-6 Worcester: Worcester 131 all out v Durham 140-4 Group two Grace Road: Leicestershire 357-5 v Gloucestershire Taunton: Somerset 360 all out v Hampshire Group three Sophia Gardens: Glamorgan 150-9 v Lancashire 173 all out Canterbury: Kent v Northamptonshire 362-5 Headingley: Yorkshire v Sussex 267-5 Good morning! June has pulled on her best summer dress, the long-tailed tits are flitting in the neighbour’s garden and the day has been marred only by an accident with the caftiere. A smorgasbord of great cricket in store, hopefully not marred too much by the weather, though it is raining in Canterbury.","charCount":"17400","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/tanyaaldred\">Tanya Aldred</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2021/jun/04/mark-wood-deserves-moment-supremacy-england-cricket-worlds-quickest-bowler","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-04T19:00:47Z","webTitle":"The need for speed: Mark Wood deserves his moment of supremacy | Barney Ronay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/jun/04/mark-wood-deserves-moment-supremacy-england-cricket-worlds-quickest-bowler","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2021/jun/04/mark-wood-deserves-moment-supremacy-england-cricket-worlds-quickest-bowler","fields":{"headline":"The need for speed: Mark Wood deserves his moment of supremacy","standfirst":"<p>The world’s quickest bowler is also England’s best and remains an impossibly likable everyday sporting hero</p>","trailText":"The quickest bowler in the world is also England’s best across all formats and he remains an impossibly likable everyday sporting hero","byline":"Barney Ronay","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"08adcf0a74f36924d2ec95ae6264a6d176fba894\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08adcf0a74f36924d2ec95ae6264a6d176fba894/0_0_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘Wood bowled a ball at 97mph in that spell.

And he’s very accurate.” </p> \n  <p>Burns and Root are the two 30-year-olds in a batting unit otherwise made up of 20-somethings and, with Ollie Pope, Dan Lawrence and debutant James Bracey in next, there are only 22 caps of experience to come before the tail begins. New Zealand are hoping a pitch that had started to show some signs of inconsistent bounce, as well as the odd ball that turned for Mitchell Santner, emerges offering similar assistance following a day spent under the covers. </p> \n  <p>Jurgensen added: “You always have to believe you can push for a result. It’s not offering a lot of bounce but there is enough for all the bowlers, either spin or seam. It’s a matter of being patient, bowling the way we know we can.”</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-60ba49318f082e80569f652a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/adam-collins\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-04T15:41:13.297Z\">4.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Thanks for your company. </strong>It’s a bit odd when we sit around here talking for hours on days when it rains, but it’s always entertaining.

With all this advertising revenue, they could afford to reduce ticket prices a smidgen, could they not?”</p> \n  <p>Yes, this is contested space. A sponsor on the front of the shirt wasn’t permitted in Test cricket until (if I recall correctly) last year when international cricket returned.

They are now recognised the world over (affectionately referred to as ‘egg and bacon’).</p> \n  <p>MCC Museum houses a boundary flag dating from this period, which is the earliest known example of the red and yellow monogram, but it remains a mystery on why these colours were chosen – though a number of explanations have been proposed.<br><br>The colours are similar to those used as racing colours by The Duke of Richmond who had strong ties with the Club in the early days of MCC. While it has also been suggested that the colours were borrowed from the wandering club I Zingari who were founded in 1845 and shared many members with the MCC. </p> \n  <p>However, common consensus leans to the Club taking on its colours as a personal thank you to William Nicholson who assisted in purchasing the freehold of Lord’s Ground. Nicholson, an MCC Member, was also the owner of the Nicholson’s Gin Company, the colours of which were red and yellow – in what was perhaps an early example of corporate sponsorship.”</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-60ba15198f082ac930aea21d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-04T11:57:59.427Z\">12.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Right, I guess that’s lunch.

The weekend’s weather forecast is at least dry and for the hosts there is plenty still to do. Rory Burns, 59 not out, and Joe Root, unbeaten on 42, will resume with their side 111 for two after 43 overs but still 267 runs in arrears and up against a bowling attack that should be fully recharged from the break in proceedings. Burns in particular will be heartened by his start to the series and an 11th score of 50 or more in Test cricket, even if there was a sliding doors moment on day two when surviving a tight lbw shout from Tim Southee on five. After missing the tour of Sri Lanka in January for paternity leave, Burns was dropped after two Tests in India as two squandered starts of 33 and 25 and two ducks – plus Jonny Bairstow’s return to the tour – forced England into a rethink. It followed a low-key end to last summer that threatened his status as a centrally contracted Test player but having been restored for this series in a further show of faith, the left-hander’s homespun game has looked in good order thus far. Root, meanwhile, faces a resumption of what has become an intriguing battle with Colin de Grandhomme. The all-rounder’s medium pace accounted for Root’s wicket during the World Cup final in 2019 and once again proved a struggle on day two, offering few scoring options and rapping the England captain on the hand. Shane Jurgensen, New Zealand’s bowling coach, said: “I love watching it from up on the balcony. Colin certainly presents a challenge for Joe. He can swing it and seam it, and you may see on the speed gun it’s 115-125kph but he’s extremely strong, so he bowls a heavy ball. And he’s very accurate.” Burns and Root are the two 30-year-olds in a batting unit otherwise made up of 20-somethings and, with Ollie Pope, Dan Lawrence and debutant James Bracey in next, there are only 22 caps of experience to come before the tail begins. New Zealand are hoping a pitch that had started to show some signs of inconsistent bounce, as well as the odd ball that turned for Mitchell Santner, emerges offering similar assistance following a day spent under the covers. Jurgensen added: “You always have to believe you can push for a result. It’s not offering a lot of bounce but there is enough for all the bowlers, either spin or seam. It’s a matter of being patient, bowling the way we know we can.” The only cricket played at Lord’s yesterday took place at the back of the new Compton and Edrich stands, as a gaggle of hopeful but unrewarded spectators took part in an impromptu game that defied the unrelenting drizzle.

It’s a matter of being patient, bowling the way we know we can.” Thanks for your company. It’s a bit odd when we sit around here talking for hours on days when it rains, but it’s always entertaining. Have nice weekends. We’ll try again on the OBO from 10am. Bye! Ah well. 98 overs tomorrow, the ECB say, with play from 11am. “Hi Adam!” Neil Bell in Sweden, good afternoon to you. “A quick question: why are tests held over five days in the first place? On another note I wanted to tell you about our app called ‘Umpire’s Call’ - it has been out for a about a year and thought future umpires could try and see how good they are judging LBW decisions.” Sure, happy to give you a plug - looking forward to having a play. As for the length of Tests, that was a process of evolution. As recently as the 1926 Ashes, four of the five were over three days (all draws) with the decider timeless. After WW2, this settled down a bit. “How long before the cricketers’ shirts resemble a Formula 1 driving suit?” asks Mojo Wellington. “Three advertisers on the England top, plus on the umpires, stumps, outfield, boundary (how I miss the rope). Hell, they’d stick a car advert on the ball if they could find a way to keep the shine on it. With all this advertising revenue, they could afford to reduce ticket prices a smidgen, could they not?” Yes, this is contested space. A sponsor on the front of the shirt wasn’t permitted in Test cricket until (if I recall correctly) last year when international cricket returned. The thinking behind it was this gave boards the chance to make up some lost revenue from Covid-19. It does stand out because it is lucrative territory. As for ticket prices, this is where there is another conflict between stadium economics and the objective to grow the game. The fact is, Test Matches typically sell out in the UK, regardless of the price point. So, it’s short-form cricket that has to do the heavy-lifting in terms of getting people through the gate without as much disposable income. Thus, plenty of cheap tickets for The Hundred. John Robbins with the final contribution for our XI. “Rick Parfitt of Status Quo as 4th seamer: ideal dodgy hair, steady bowling action with limited variation but guaranteed to get the Barmy Army going. Especially their belter “Rain”. HRH Prince Philip: good for 99 runs but even better for the generally politically incorrect sledging from first slip. It’s nice and sunny in Solihull.” On weather, I should report that the rain is heavier where I am, five miles east of Lord’s. Sky are back on now... it’s still raining at HQ. A reminder that 6pm is the cut off to get any play on this third day. “I like your re-jigged Test Championship effort, personally.” Thank you, Josh Copper, who is currently watching Lancs. “At least it tries to deal with some of the big problems of the current format (i.e. series of different lengths carrying the same weight of points.) Though I worry about how teams are going to bowl 98 overs in a day when they can’t do 90 in glorious sunshine.” Good point! But one cricket problem per day on the OBO, I say. A throwback to a discussion Daniel was having earlier today, via David Duncan. “Daniel observed “Egg and Bacon” as an unusual word-order (inn the context of MCC colours). Just observing that in Scotland, many of us describe / make / order a “roll on bacon” not “bacon roll”. Similarly “roll on sausage”; “roll on fried egg”, “roll on black pudding”. We tend to eschew the American “bun” or English “butty”, at least in the breakfast food context. Not sure if any fellow Scots may have an explanation for the word order - maybe something to do with Gaelic language construction…?” Scots, the floor is yours. “Afternoon Adam.” Allo, Brian Withington. “At Test Match level, a potentially useful sanction on the formerly amusing but now infamous Celebrappeal would be that it constitutes a deemed review of the compulsory not out decision. If reviews are already exhausted then it’s simply a no-ball. Sorted.” Or just a bit of a re-jig to Law 42. Shouldn’t be too difficult. Oh, there is some live international cricket on right now, I’m told! Would it surprise you to learn that my entire inbox contains historical figures and where they might bat or bowl? Let’s do a handful more and I might move it on a bit after that. “In their own very different ways,” writes Ewan Glenton, “surely Jack the Ripper, Lord Lucan and mathematician David Hilbert have all played themselves into contention as wicketkeeper over the years, having stumped so many people.” Very good. “I would absolutely insist on finding a space in the team for Sigmund Freud,” suggests Dawn Morgan. “He’d be a natural at slip.” “Surely Machiavelli as captain?” Kerrith Britland reckons. “And, of course, Caravaggio for some violent chin music.” Peter Salmon wants Jacques Derrida. And he sends me a photo of the French philosopher playing the game as well - nice. Peter Metcalfe, with his umpire’s hat on. “Pope Gregory the First. With papal infallibility, there would be no need for any reviews.” Last but not least, the great Gary Naylor. “I’m surprised that the rather militaristic XI did not find room for Barnes Wallis, whose bouncers were more destructive than Harold Larwood’s.” The short-history of hat-tricks. A note from from pal at Wisden Cricket Monthly Towers, Jim Wallace, who wrote the below piece. He’s writing to us from Lord’s. “It looks wet. To get my Blackadder on - Wetter than Wet Wet Wet performing a cover of ‘waterfalls’ on a wet weekend in Wetwang. For my money, Naseem Shah’s hat-trick is up there as one of the best, his age alone putting him in the conversation. Irfan Pathan’s first over effort and Mathew Hoggard’s Barbados blitzkrieg are also firm favorites.” This is, what we would call in my politics days, a killer fact. Ian Ward confirms that a) it’s still raining and b) they need to be on by 6pm to get any play in today. They won’t need long to clean it up, that much I do know from having commentated all the county games at Lord’s this season. Half an hour of dry weather is enough. “Surely Sir Francis Bacon, Sir Water Raleigh, Victor Hugo should be in the team as they were all bowlers!” insists NC Benson. “And if you want variations surely Edward Elgar can’t be overlooked!” Wills Doug is here too: “Thatcher’s a run out waiting to happen. (This lady’s not for turning).” And Tom Morgan has a few candidates. “Graham Greene fielding at third man? A Beatles tribute band in the covers? As captain, the great general Hannibal. If he could get elephants over the Alps, he could get a few more fiery old-ball overs out of a tired fast bowler. “Afternoon Adam.” Allo, Elliot Brooks. “I’m sure this has been litigated enough already, but surely just two tests isn’t enough for a New Zealand series? They’re always such great competition, and I always get a text from my mum at the start of each game that says: ‘Isn’t Kane Williamson lovely? A proper sportsman.’ That’s real value, there.” Okay, deep breath. Are we ready for my World Test Championship re-jig? Are you going to be kind in your emails when you disagree? Two groups of six, for starters. It has to include all Test nations. And let’s accept that we’ll find an elegant way to sort those groups out every two years - seedings from the previous cycle will do it. What about the points? Here’s the controversial bit. For mine, only three-Test series to count in the WTC; no more two-Test business. All series (and matches) to therefore be worth the same. Issue one: whaddabout the Ashes and other four/five Test series? In this model, only the first three would count in the WTC. My belief is that the Ashes/Border-Gavaskar is important enough that the final two Tests wouldn’t mean any less because the WTC bit is finished. Issue two: the cost of putting on Tests - a big issue for many of the non-Big Three nations. A compromise. If they agree to play series of three instead of two, they can play those contests over four days. Now, I dislike four-day Test cricket; I don’t want that to become the norm. But if this is the trade-off to get New Zealand playing Pakistan thrice at home, to set the global standard at three instead of two, then I think it is a worthy price to pay. Especially when those four-day affairs have been, so far, over 98-overs per day, rather than 90. From there, the top team from each group makes the WTC Final. Alternatively, the top two, with a new round-robin to begin to determine the two teams to play in the Grand Final. Et voila! “Adam.” Andrew Benton. “And there I was, thinking a Celebrappeal was appealing in the style of a celebrity. That’d be much more fun, and an almost limitless supply of celebs to emulate / mock!” It’s been great fun but it’s now a big part of the county game which, in turn, means it’ll start to infect recreational cricket. No thanks. Henry J. Heinz is Charles Sheldrick’s spinner in our Historical XI. “For his numerous variations.” “Good afternoon Adam.” Hello, Sam Charlton. “Whilst not much of a problem at present at Lords, the glorious weather creates a unique issue I want to bring to your attention: face mask tan lines. An unfortunate soul whom I go out to events with as a nurse found this out the hard way. Obviously it is hilarious for everyone else, but not if you’re the victim.” Only the hard-hitting issues during a rainy OBO! But it’s a good point. I once overdid it at the Aussie Open with sunglasses on with the burn line causing me all sorts of grief for about, oh, six months. Another time, falling asleep at the MCG with my shirt off (this day), nearly landed me in hospital. I deserved for it to land me in hospital. The Historical Figures XI is popular. Stephen Holden wants Jesus Christ to feature in the middle order. “He’s a big hitter. Apparently he cleared the temple.” Very good. Michael Robinson has Charlemagne in the mix. “And just in behind Caesar would be a nice place for Brutus.” A full XI from Mark Dawson? Alright, go on then: Stonewall Jackson, La Pasionara, General Patton, Prince Rupert Erwin, Rommel (C, also handy as a fourth seamer), Marshal Ney, Florence Nightingale (keeper), Quintus Fabius, Oliver Cromwell, Marshall Zhukov Saladi. Very... militaristic. Hello, everyone. Like Daniel, I’m also about five miles from Lord’s and my assessment of the situation is much the same as his. But we’ll make our own fun in the usual way, won’t we? I’ve spent my morning writing about trying to stamp out Celebrappeals, because I’m a really cool guy like that. Coming from a place of love, of course - Broad fandom, one must be part of it. But still. That wasn’t good yesterday, from the England champion, nor Tim Southee later on. Sorry to start negatively. Must be the rain. Here’s Nassem Shah’s hat-trick (featuring a Celebrappeal, wicket two) - what joyous cricket. Right, that’s me done for the day. Here’s Adam Collins to ease you through the rest of the day, which will hopefully feature some klikkit – email him on adam.collins.casual@theguardian.com. “I have managed to create a holy trinity of Steve Davis, Boiler Room and OBO,” says Patrick Duce. “Who’d have thought it? A one hour DJ set should get us through to the end of play?” DJ Steve Davis is a bit techno for my taste – what a succession of words that is – but any port in a storm. “Greetings from sunny Lago Como,” brags Tom Morgan. “Alastair Campbell – spin option, Mrs Tiggywinkle – seam-stress, Coco Chanel – number 5.” Laugh! “XI of historical figures,” emails Alistair Leadbetter. “I think there’s room in there for Gandhi, Einstein, Aristotle, and the fearsome duo of Martin Luther and Martin Luther King. This reminds me of when I used to play Owzat and had plenty of non-cricketing teams such as Rock Stars, Artists, Philosophers, Sunderland players, etc. I say ‘used to’, but who am I kidding...? It helps pass a rainy day.” Somewhere at my parents’ house is an original set, and I can’t contest those suggestions, especially not the spin-twins of Einstein and Aristotle. “Do you think the Black Caps were deliberately bowling on Burns’ leg stump,” asks Ruth Purdue, “or did they have their radar off? As he gets most of his runs on the leg side, it seemed curious.” I’d guess the latter – lefties get a load of deliveries in that area, and getting used or re-used to the slope probably exacerbates that. It’s still raining just under five miles from Lord’s, so I imagine it’s still doing likewise at Lord’s. I’m still hopeful we’ll get some play, but the forecast is not especially inspiring, and a total washout is undeniably on the agenda. If we were compiling an XI of historical figures, who would be in it? Feel free to fill in the gaps, or drop those I’ve picked. 1. Steve Davis 2. Alexander the Great 3. Julius Caesar 4. 5. Napoleon 6. God 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. Boudica (RF) Back to our earlier chat about pitches, another flat-track advantage is work for the spinners: on a 220 all-out green top, they’re not going to do much, but on a batting wicket they’ll be as crucial as the first hour. I can see no flaw in this rationale whatsoever. If it’s any consolation, is also raining in Paris – but they’ve got a roof. Here we go, the ubiquitous prawns in Marie Rose their own separate course. Nothing to do with cricket, and yet everything to do with everything. We’ve got plenty play in the Champo, and Tanya Aldred has the latest – check it out. “Enjoying the non cricket convo!” emails Mark Slater. “Because I was otherwise occupied I am a bit late to the OBO, but I would like to voice my appreciation at the sharing of the Mysterons, the finest Hale and Pace appreciation turn ever!” There aren’t many albums that so evoke a time, and I’m pleased to report that it’s aged beautifully – I played it to my seven-year-old recently, and was greeted with none of the usual disparagement. Just rereading the MCC colour explanation, is this the only context in which we talk of “egg and bacon” rather than “bacon and egg”? And is there a linguistic reason we describe paurs of objects in particular order, so never say “chips and fish,” “fork and knife” or “blame and bang”? I’m afraid to say. I guess we’re 90 minutes away from play, minimum. Hello again. “How was it that the MCC chose the Catalan colours for their branding, way back in the mists of time?” wonders Andrew Benton. “Even the MCC logo looks like it’s a big C! Was there a tour to Barcelona in the 18xx’s that inspired them .... or did the Catalans like cricket and copy the MCC?” The Lord’s website teaches as follows, but it doesn’t claim to be definitive: “The original MCC colour of sky blue was replaced in Victorian times by the famous red and yellow. They are now recognised the world over (affectionately referred to as ‘egg and bacon’). MCC Museum houses a boundary flag dating from this period, which is the earliest known example of the red and yellow monogram, but it remains a mystery on why these colours were chosen – though a number of explanations have been proposed. The colours are similar to those used as racing colours by The Duke of Richmond who had strong ties with the Club in the early days of MCC. While it has also been suggested that the colours were borrowed from the wandering club I Zingari who were founded in 1845 and shared many members with the MCC. However, common consensus leans to the Club taking on its colours as a personal thank you to William Nicholson who assisted in purchasing the freehold of Lord’s Ground. Nicholson, an MCC Member, was also the owner of the Nicholson’s Gin Company, the colours of which were red and yellow – in what was perhaps an early example of corporate sponsorship.” Right, I guess that’s lunch. I’m off to marinate some lamb – see you in about 40, hopefully for some cricket. There they are, the lads. Goodness me. Sky are showing a doc about England’s hilarious trip to India in 1992-93; for the first Test, England picked four seamers and one spinner, while India picked one seamer and three spinners. Who to believe? “I’ve expressed myself (and Tom) a little clumsily there,” returns Mike Daniels, “but the point he was making was that if you only play on flat wickets you won’t necessarily promote the mindset and techniques of taking wickets, you will, in the main, promote defensive bowling. You’re right that you need to take wickets to win a Test but you won’t necessarily develop the bowlers to think about taking wickets if you don’t put them into situations where the pressure is on them to take wickets, and there’s no better place to do that than in a situation where they are expected to, as opposed to hoping to. The bowler then has to develop the relevant techniques to do so in varied conditions.” I see both sides, I really do, but it’s also the case that England have struggled to take 20 wickets in India and Australia and I’d guess that more practise on flat tracks is likely to be helpful. On which point, I absolutely loved this – sentiment and turn of phrase. Please excuse my namedrop, but KP told me the same, and that if you were out or fielding, you waded in to the fullest possible extent. He also reserved particular praise the the prawns in Marie Rose sauce. Weather update: it’s still raining, so lunch will be taken as usual at 1pm meaning no play until 1.40pm at the earliest but realistically, it’ll probably be later than that. “At the risk of being ‘that guy’,” says Nick Ridgman, “I must insist that Detectorists is referred to by its proper name, sans rogue ‘The’.” Behold my “Netherlands” below! “Still trying to work out if Silverwood would have preferred a flat pitch or a lively one as a player,” muses Sean Clayton. “If we believe Wikipedia, Bob Cottam claimed Silverwood was faster than Allan Donald (!) but I remember him as more of a swing and seam bowler than an outright paceman...” I’m certain he’d have fancied a greentop – and no, I’m not sure he was quite as quick as Ai Dee. “Stealing a break to glance at the OBO in the rehearsal room (Le Wine Club with Anna Lou, opens Brighton Fringe June 19th since you ask),” begins Michael Keane. “Shame about the weather but wondering if you have any updates on the ODI in Utrecht? Don’t know which site is best for scores so thought I’d email you. And much as I love Ireland, having the live stream on here while directing would probably be unprofessional...” Netherlands are 123-8 off 40, so Ireland are pretty well-placed. Good luck with the play! “Flatter pitches,” begins Mike Daniels. “Tom Cartwright would say that producing flatter pitches doesn’t produce better bowlers except in the sense that they become better defensive bowlers. He ascribed to the view that pitches with something in them made for better bowlers as it put the pressure on the bowlers to deliver wickets and develop an attacking mindset rather than a defensive one. The good bowlers will find a way to take wickets on most surfaces if that’s the way that they set out to achieve.” That’s a really interesting angle – so much of sport, and life, is played in the mind. I’m not sure I can buy it though, because you can’t win a Test bowling defensively on a flat track – you need to find a way to attack even with no help from the conditions. And another of looking at things might be that the good bowlers look to attack on every wicket. “On the subject of spreading joy,” emails Brian Withington, “all three seasons of the Detectorists are a delight but the last episode is simply wonderful. See also Marvellous, also with the impeccably life-affirming Toby Jones lead role. You’re welcome.” Someone pressed the Detectorists on me quite some time ago, and I sort of mentally filed it under whimsy. But if it’s worth a go, will have a look – and agree on Marvellous. Ian Ward reckons rain until about 2pm, then we should get a decent amount of cricket thereafter. “From his mouth to God’s ears,” as my Gran would’ve said. “G’day Daniel,” says Alistair Connor. “I’m thinking ‘Ha. England. Summer. Rain.’ But to be honest, you’ve got just as much of a chance of rain interruption in Auckland in December. Except that the rain is warmer. And it doesn’t last all bloody day.” What’s especially galling here is that in most of the country, they’re playing – even Old Trafford, for crying out loud. But hopefully we’ll get enough in today to make the next two days what they should be. In other what were you doing at 16 affirmation: I’m sure that when he’s not in the middle, he’s memorising every lyric and noise of Dummy. Oh, and one more: Musa Okwonga’s book, One of Them, achieves the difficult feat of being an easy read – it’s propulsive and entertaining – and a difficult read – it teaches you things about the world and about yourself that are upsetting. Find out more: Longtime members of our community will know that the OBO is not just for cricket but for the general sharing of joy, so allow me to recommend a couple of things that have enriched my recent life: Les Misérables – not the original, but the Ladj Li film on Netflix – is really, really worth your heart and mind. And, on an entirely different tip, American Barbecue Showdown has perhaps the most likeable cast of any reality show I’ve seen. Yeah, it’s still raining. No one has sent me any cake to stimulate conversation but we can pretend to the contrary; I’d love a school dinner-style treacle sponge. It’s interesting that Chris Silverwood has asked for flatter pitches this summer, so his bowlers get better at finding a way and his batsmen get better at occupying the crease. I guess we can add it to the IPL on our list of things about which KP was right, but otherwise that strikes me as good news for Jofra Archer and Mark Wood, whose pace becomes even more valuable. I also can’t wait to see how Branderson impose themselves just when we think that conditions are against them. Pivoting back to the match, Rory Burns will be delighted to have got a score here. I guess there’s a feeling that England’s top three aren’t quite cemented yet, Burns and Sibley good players who’ve not yet made the runs to waive stylistic concerns and Crawley seeking to bring his bottom level closer to his very acceptable top level. I hope all three do well this summer, but I’d absolutely love another look at Hasseb Hameed, and not just because of his luscious locks. “Since we’re on a hip-hop tip,” says George Browne, “Do you think today’s cloud will see the ball hooping around?” In the first hour, for sure, but at 60 minutes and one second? Who can say. The umpires are in the middle and the pitch is being uncovered, which is good I guess – though looking around and looking out my window, the weather does not scream “CRICKET!” There’s play in the champo pretty much across the country – they’re delayed at Trent Bridge and Canterbury, but going strong everywhere else. This country, eh? Anyhow, follow the action here: “Shame about this rain, eh,” laments Andrew Cosgrove. “I couldn’t agree more about the new stands, they look fantastic. When you bemoaned the loss of the toilets, I thought you were talking about my greatest grievance. I used to love the magnificent urinals at the Nursery End. I think they might have been Edwardian, acres of porcelain. The fact that the entrance and egress appeared to have been designed by someone who had given absolutely no thought to the most efficient way of getting hundreds of men in and out just added to the charm, somehow. I believe those toilets are no more, but it turns out you were talking about a different toilet.” I know your ones too, and yes, I agree – I like to believe that the small opening and vast expanse was a metaphor for opening a window into the soul. Anyway, how is learning every note of a classic album not more crucial than matrices, Great Expectations and the French idioms on page 175 of Tricolore? “Cruciality is relative,” philosophises Matt Dony, “and only truly understood when we can look back on a period and place it within a wider context. (My GCSE year, for example, was supposed to be ‘crucial’, and yet the fact that I wasted it learning every guitar note of Mellon Collie And The Infinite Sadness appears to have done no lasting damage). When taking about upcoming time periods, I would argue that we only ever have the potential for cruciality. The first hour’s play could be crucial. We won’t know until we’re looking back on it. And, anyway, time is a man-made construct, and nothing truly matters. Happy Friday, everyone.” That takes me back – I too did GCSEs in what graffiti around Golders Green and Camden Town knew as “Nutty 9T5”. I didn’t have the dexterity for guitar-playing, but did visit Virgin Megastore and ease open the plastic protecting various sheet music books, in order to copy down lyrics into my homework diary. Failing that, I would wait until my Walkman battery ran down and my tapes played slowly; who needs the internet? The rain doesn’t look “set in” but doesn’t look likely to disappear in the next bit. We’ve not been advised about a potential start-time which isn’t a great sign. Would it ever be possible to take, say, six weeks in the calendar and hold a Test-match World Cup? Last 16, last eight, semi-finals and final, one and done? I daresay I would watch it. The new Compton and Edrich stands look the absolute business, don’t they? I have reservations – boxes in the middle of the two tiers, sending the upper deck further from the action, less sun for those so inclined – but the view from the bottom looks so much better. Ultimately, you’ve got to credit the MCC in that every single ground improvement has been an absolute belter, on its own and as part of the whole. One minor tragedy, though, is the loss of the greatest toilets in the world – those were in the Warner, and featured a window which afforded members a view of the middle. It’s still raining, but that’s sort of good news. It means we should have play through all five days – and, as per the below, prospect of cricket is better than no cricket – on top of which, for those that can it’s worth investigating tickets for Sunday because there may be some. Tim Southee had a chat with Sky, discussing the inswinger he’s found and with which he dismissed Zak Crawley yesterday. It’s incredible really – how good he’s been without one – and how watching James Anderson can leave one taking such behaviour for granted “If the first hour is crucial, yet is lost to rain, does that hour remain crucial or does the next one take on that role?” wonders Phil Withall. “Does time lose its meaning if nothing happens during it or does it become more valuable for that reason? Do I need help?” These are the issues we’re here to tackle. I’m using my crucial first hour to debate the contents of my cool bag for tomorrow – did you know that Jews are forbidden from carrying on Saturdays, but if various posts are erected in the correct manner this no longer applies, and it’s now possible to do so all the way from Woodside Park to St John’s Wood, yes I will be making kiddush and hamotzi – but otherwise, I’m not sure. I would, though, like to know which are the uncrucial hours, and am certain that time is illmatic, keep static like wool fabric. Ah man, it’s so good to be back. Rain during cricket is somehow the best rain there is and the worst rain there is all at the same time. We’re looking at Joe Root, who may well hold the key to this Test. We’ve been here many times before – him looking sensational and in total command of the bowlers – but too often, he’s allowed himself to get out without grinding home his artistry. It might be that he’s over the bump, and though today won’t prove anything either way, a serious score will make a statement. Yesssss. Just caught a “first hour is crucial” in a Sky montage, but was looking at my fingers so not sure who bestowed it upon us. More news as I get it. Alan Gardner, OBO alumnus, has confirmed on Cricinfo that it’s raining at Lord’s, so there’s a strong chance we’ll have to spend the first bit of the morning amusing ourselves. As such, aitch or haitch? The Fresh Prince of Manny has strong thoughts on the topic. Not that far from haitch cue, I’m afraid it’s been raining, and the morning prognosis – courtesy of the Met Office – is not a good one. But we should still have enough time for the match to unfold. A normal person looks at this Test match – the players, the conditions, the game – says draw and moves on. Except nothing about Test matches – nor the people obsessed by them – says normal, so here we are at the start of day three simply saying more more more more more more. The thing with sport is that though most encounters aren’t classics – like everyday life – the possibility of a classic always exists – not like everyday life – a truth that is perfectly encapsulated by this perfect thing of ours. So here we are. Yeah, alright. Anyone with the vaguest familiarity with English cricket is expecting a glorious collapse rich with symbolism and allegory – the sensation is gorgeously palpable – but anyone with the vaguest familiarity with this England cricket team is wondering which of the various freaks is poised to do something definitive – the sensation is hilariously ill-conceived. And similar is so of New Zealand, which really sets up what we’re about to see. With runs on the board they should be the happier side, except with not as many runs on the board as they’d have liked, they’re the more vulnerable side. Or, put another way, this is why we’re here. Go well, everyone.

A new document released on Friday called Strategy for Reopening Borders says people who are fully vaccinated – which is understood to mean two weeks after having the second dose of an EU-approved vaccine, which covers all jabs currently in use in the UK – can use the NHS app as proof of their status, the Daily Mail reports. Children accompanying fully vaccinated adults will not need to have a vaccine but must prove a negative test result. While there is no specific age cut-off point, according to the French government, travel rules currently do not apply to children under 11. Tourists with only one dose of a vaccine, or who are unvaccinated, must isolate for seven days, provide proof of a negative test result on arrival and have a “compelling reason” for visiting. The French government announced earlier on Friday that it was removing the need for coronavirus tests for vaccinated Europeans and allowing vaccinated tourists from most of the world, including the US, to visit, provided they had a negative test. The Associated Press has reported that the new rules will come into effect on 9 June when the border is set to reopen and allow other European tourists into the country. The announcement comes as the European Commission prepares to issue digital travel certificates to allow Europeans to travel freely across the bloc. However, the French government’s travel relaxations come a day after the British government imposed more substantial travel restrictions to stop the spread of Covid-19. France remains on the amber list, which means Britons, regardless of vaccination status, will have to quarantine for 10 days on their return and take two Covid tests, and test negative before arrival.","charCount":"1873","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/edna-mohamed\">Edna Mohamed</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}

Keaton Jennings was the master builder, crafting his first red-ball century since he made 146 not out for England against Sri Lanka in November 2018. After a couple of years in the wilderness, this season he has rediscovered both touch and brio. Away he chugged, putting on 19 runs in the first 45 minutes with Luke Wells, but there were occasional boulders as well as bricks, as skimming cover drives and gleaming late cuts were plucked from the level.</p> <p><strong>Yorkshire</strong> plugged away, throwing on Dom Bess, his baggy trousers and shaggy hair a sharp contrast to Jennings‚Äô ironed creases and buttoned cuffs. Yorkshire eventually got their hands on the new ball they had been after all day, and it tookonly five overs to make a breakthrough as Jennings was caught at first slip after a partnership of 175 with Wells. One became three as Wells, then Livingstone followed. But on Lancashire went. For a while it seemed they would try for maximum batting bonus points as Dane Vilas straight drove Steven Patterson for four, then dropped to one knee and pulled him behind square, and Bess was biffed for straight sixes, with Josh Bohannon reaching the scorers‚Äô box high in the media centre. But sense soon prevailed and the grind, grind, grind returned.</p> <p>A sixth wicket stand of 125 between Ryan ten Doeschate (55) and Adam Wheater (81) rescued <strong>Essex</strong> from an unbecoming 53 for five to finish the day with a towering lead at Chester-le-Street. <strong>Durham </strong>were earlier bowled out for 99; such was the haste of their demise that Simon Harmer didn‚Äôt even get to wrap his bowling fingers around the ball.</p> <p>Saif Zaib‚Äôs 64 helped <strong>Northants</strong> to a handy first-innings lead at Hove. After a post-tea wobble, Tom Haines and Ben Brown inched <strong>Sussex </strong>ahead.</p> <p>Lewis Hill and Callum Parkinson were the only players to make their mark on <strong>Leicestershire</strong>‚Äôs first innings of 136. Martin Andersson was too much for their middle order, picking up four for 27, his best figures for <strong>Middlesex</strong>.</p> <p>Hashim Amla continued to scatter his munificence at The Oval, finishing with 173, and <strong>Surrey </strong>473, thanks to a bit of hurry-up from Rikki Clarke and Sean Abbott. <strong>Gloucestershire</strong> must now bat out two days on a turning pitch, with Amar Virdi already in the wickets shortly before rain stopped play.</p> <p>A last wicket can-can of 52 for <strong>Warwickshire</strong> between Liam Norwell and Oliver Hannon-Dalby proved a morning irritation to <strong>Nottinghamshire </strong>on a day interrupted by showers. Norwell, who had frying-panned three sixes, then nipped in to remove England-bound Haseeb Hameed for 39, Ben Duckett and, later, Ben Slater for 77.</p> <p>Ed Barnard coaxed the tail into a morning wag with another handy innings, this time of 90, as <strong>Worcestershire </strong>reached 421. On a rain-interrupted afternoon, <strong>Derbyshire</strong> lost three wickets.</p> </div>   </div>","wordcount":"1422","commentCloseDate":"2021-06-01T09:36:51Z","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2021-05-29T09:36:51Z","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2021-05-29T12:00:45Z","liveBloggingNow":"true","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/p/htfg7","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc624794dfe625fbec8524b88b085e399db67444/0_109_2700_1620/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","isLive":"true","bodyText":"Emma Lamb has reached her hundred, 107 not out, against Western Storm; Peter Handsomb and John Simpson at the crease for Middlesex, who have lost three this morning, but have a healthy padding of 284 over Leicestershire With an over to go, Bohannon needs another eight for his century, Danny Lamb ten for his fifty.

Yorkshire eventually got their hands on the new ball they had been after all day, and it tookonly five overs to make a breakthrough as Jennings was caught at first slip after a partnership of 175 with Wells. One became three as Wells, then Livingstone followed. But on Lancashire went. For a while it seemed they would try for maximum batting bonus points as Dane Vilas straight drove Steven Patterson for four, then dropped to one knee and pulled him behind square, and Bess was biffed for straight sixes, with Josh Bohannon reaching the scorers‚Äô box high in the media centre. But sense soon prevailed and the grind, grind, grind returned. A sixth wicket stand of 125 between Ryan ten Doeschate (55) and Adam Wheater (81) rescued Essex from an unbecoming 53 for five to finish the day with a towering lead at Chester-le-Street. Durham were earlier bowled out for 99; such was the haste of their demise that Simon Harmer didn‚Äôt even get to wrap his bowling fingers around the ball. Saif Zaib‚Äôs 64 helped Northants to a handy first-innings lead at Hove. After a post-tea wobble, Tom Haines and Ben Brown inched Sussex ahead. Lewis Hill and Callum Parkinson were the only players to make their mark on Leicestershire‚Äôs first innings of 136. Martin Andersson was too much for their middle order, picking up four for 27, his best figures for Middlesex. Hashim Amla continued to scatter his munificence at The Oval, finishing with 173, and Surrey 473, thanks to a bit of hurry-up from Rikki Clarke and Sean Abbott. Gloucestershire must now bat out two days on a turning pitch, with Amar Virdi already in the wickets shortly before rain stopped play. A last wicket can-can of 52 for Warwickshire between Liam Norwell and Oliver Hannon-Dalby proved a morning irritation to Nottinghamshire on a day interrupted by showers. Norwell, who had frying-panned three sixes, then nipped in to remove England-bound Haseeb Hameed for 39, Ben Duckett and, later, Ben Slater for 77. Ed Barnard coaxed the tail into a morning wag with another handy innings, this time of 90, as Worcestershire reached 421. On a rain-interrupted afternoon, Derbyshire lost three wickets.","charCount":"8121","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/tanyaaldred\">Tanya Aldred</a> at Old Trafford"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"food/2021/may/29/vanilla-jam-sponge-potato-cheese-flatbread-ravneet-gill-recipes","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-29T12:00:24Z","webTitle":"Jam sponge and cheesy flatbread: Ravneet Gill‚Äôs recipes for young bakers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/may/29/vanilla-jam-sponge-potato-cheese-flatbread-ravneet-gill-recipes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/food/2021/may/29/vanilla-jam-sponge-potato-cheese-flatbread-ravneet-gill-recipes","fields":{"headline":"Jam sponge and cheesy flatbread: Ravneet Gill‚Äôs recipes for young bakers","standfirst":"<p>Little hands will have lots of fun with this school dinner sponge cake and simple savoury flatbread</p>","trailText":"Little hands will have lots of fun with this school dinner sponge cake and simple savoury flatbread","byline":"Ravneet Gill","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"23edadbaec357e2b07d1412a81ea8072c889e057\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23edadbaec357e2b07d1412a81ea8072c889e057/0_565_3761_4860/774.jpg\" alt=\"Ravneet Gill‚Äôs vanilla sponge with jam and coconut.\" width=\"774\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ravneet Gill‚Äôs vanilla sponge with jam and coconut.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kim Lightbody/The Guardian.

coffin.</p> <p>AFP reports:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>More than 22,000 people have tested positive inside jails, where inmates living cheek by jowl have been encouraged to keep wearing their masks even while they sleep.</p> <p>Authorities have floated plans to give early releases to prisoners with underlying medical conditions and have announced funding for more testing and medical care in recent days.</p> <p>But those behind bars say they have been kept in the dark about the seriousness of the outbreak.</p> <p>‚ÄúPrisoners don‚Äôt have the knowledge to protect themselves,‚Äù

after this I‚Äôm so scared [for everyone still inside] ... if you are inside the prison you are at risk, it‚Äôs unavoidable,‚Äù he said.</p> <p>Thailand‚Äôs prison outbreak has skyrocketed from just 10 publicly announced cases a month ago and sparked growing public concern after a handful of prominent activists contracted the illness.</p> <p>Among them was student leader Panusaya ‚ÄúRung‚Äù Sithijirawattanakul, who helped lead a series of rallies last year demanding political reforms in the kingdom, and who tested positive after she was released on bail.</p> <p>The Thai prison population stood at around 311,000 earlier this year, the International Federation for Human Rights said ‚Äì more than two and a half times the system‚Äôs official capacity.</p> <p>Four inmates in every five are serving time for drug charges because of harsh anti-narcotics laws that can see offenders jailed for a decade for possessing just a few methamphetamine pills.</p> <p>Many cells are so packed with bodies that some inmates only have half a metre (less than 2ft) of space.</p> <p>‚ÄúThat is less room for a body than the inside of a coffin,‚Äù justice minister <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Somsak Thepsutin</strong> told local media in February.</p> <p>Officials have tested more than 36,000 inmates in recent weeks and begun delivering Covid vaccines to inmates and prison staff.</p> <p>Somsak said he was examining ways to give early releases to prisoners with underlying medical conditions, possibly through a royal pardon.</p> <p>Even if the plan goes ahead, prisoners will still have to complete a quarantine before returning home.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-05-29T10:22:05.419Z\">at 11.22am BST</time></p>  </div> <div

Offering vaccines to children ‚Äì who ‚Äúrarely suffer badly from the disease themselves‚Äù ‚Äì could raise important practical and ethical problems, they said. Meanwhile, the head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also urged countries to reconsider vaccinating children when lower-income countries do not have enough doses to immunise vulnerable populations. In contrast, Klaus Okkenhaug, professor of immunology in the department of pathology at the University of Cambridge, said this morning that ‚Äúit would of course help for children to be vaccinated because it also reduces their opportunities to transmit this virus to their teachers‚Äù. He added that although it was ‚Äúa little bit of a fine balance because they are so unlikely to be affected by the virus‚Äù, he believes there‚Äôs ‚Äúa good argument‚Äù for vaccinating over-12s, given the ‚Äúphenomenal safety records‚Äù of some available vaccines. The organiser of the Edinburgh Fringe has said the world‚Äôs largest arts festival is ‚Äúin danger‚Äù if the Scottish government does not ease social distancing rules for venues within a fortnight. Shona McCarthy, chief executive of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe Society, called on ministers to replace the current two-metre rule with the one-metre rule used in hospitality in order to help secure the future of the 75-year-old festival. McCarthy told the Times Scotland: ‚ÄúWithin another two weeks, it‚Äôs going to be impossible for any [Edinburgh promoter] to put on anything. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a real danger for the future of the Fringe. One year of no festival was manageable, and we were able to keep it in hearts and minds and everybody still held that space in their calendar, as that annual moment for reconnection and getting together. At two years, you jeopardise the solid space the Fringe has held for 75 years.‚Äù She urged the government to ‚Äúhave that leap of faith‚Äù and trust venues to deliver services safely in the same way as the hospitality sector. The UK government appears to have abandoned its ‚Äúdata not dates‚Äù principle, an expert advising its coronavirus response has warned, adding that its reluctance to delay unlocking was leading to ‚Äúcontradictory‚Äù messaging. Prof Stephen Reicher, a psychologist on the Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours (Spi-B), joined scientists warning against the final lifting of restrictions on 21 June as cases passed 4,000 for the first time since late March on Friday. Reicher said the government had invested ‚Äúso much political capital‚Äù in particular dates that it has become difficult to diverge from them if the data suggests it is necessary. He told BBC Radio 4‚Äôs Today programme: ‚ÄúI think we are in a pickle of the government‚Äôs own making at the moment. I think the reason for that is it has departed from its own mantra of ‚Äòdata not dates‚Äô. Very quickly ‚Äòdata not dates‚Äô became ‚Äòdates not data‚Äô.‚Äù Hello, this is Clea Skopeliti taking over the blog for the next hour while Jedidajah has a break. You can message me on Twitter if you‚Äôd like to draw my attention to a story. Thanks! Indonesia will introduce a ‚ÄúWork From Bali‚Äù programme for civil servants aimed at helping to revive the island‚Äôs battered economy. Bloomberg reports: The coordinating ministry for maritime and investment affairs will start with a pilot project in Nusa Dua, once a prime location for major conferences including the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in 2013, to encourage more meetings and outbound activities on the island. ‚ÄúWe hope that with the arrival of government and state-owned company employees, the gears of Bali‚Äôs economy will start moving,‚Äù Hermin Esti Setyowati, an assistant deputy at the ministry, said in a statement on Saturday. Tourism-reliant Bali has been among the country‚Äôs hardest-hit provinces as borders remain shut, leaving its hotels and beaches empty. Its GDP shrank 9.9% in the first quarter from a year ago, following a 9.3% contraction for all of 2020. The island welcomed just 25 foreigners from January to March, compared with 1.1 million in the same period last year. The local government plans to accelerate its vaccination program with a goal of reaching herd immunity against Covid-19 by July, which could allow the island to reopen to international tourists. There is a ‚Äúgood argument‚Äù for vaccinating older children against Covid-19 given the safety records of some Covid vaccines, an expert has said. Klaus Okkenhaug, professor of immunology in the department of pathology at the University of Cambridge, told Times Radio that the decision on whether to give children coronavirus jabs was a ‚Äúdifficult question‚Äù that requires balancing wider benefits against the direct ones for children. He said: I think for a whole population it would of course help for children to be vaccinated because it also reduces their opportunities to transmit this virus to their teachers. Prof Okkenhaug said that when considering the ‚Äúdirect benefits to the children‚Äù it was ‚Äúa little bit of a fine balance because they are so unlikely to be affected by the virus‚Äù. He added: But I think given the phenomenal safety records of some of the vaccines out there, there‚Äôs a good argument for going ahead at least with older children, say 12 and above. A coronavirus surge sweeping through Thailand‚Äôs prisons has thrown the spotlight on the kingdom‚Äôs overcrowded penal system, where some inmates have less space to sleep than the inside of a coffin. AFP reports: More than 22,000 people have tested positive inside jails, where inmates living cheek by jowl have been encouraged to keep wearing their masks even while they sleep. Authorities have floated plans to give early releases to prisoners with underlying medical conditions and have announced funding for more testing and medical care in recent days. But those behind bars say they have been kept in the dark about the seriousness of the outbreak. ‚ÄúPrisoners don‚Äôt have the knowledge to protect themselves,‚Äù said Somyot Prueksakasemsuk, a high-profile activist facing charges under Thailand‚Äôs harsh royal defamation law. Somyot was bailed last month and told AFP that he had not been tested for Covid-19 once during his 10-week stint in custody. He was not worried about contracting the disease while in jail because he had no idea about the level of risk. ‚ÄúBut after this I‚Äôm so scared [for everyone still inside] ... if you are inside the prison you are at risk, it‚Äôs unavoidable,‚Äù he said. Thailand‚Äôs prison outbreak has skyrocketed from just 10 publicly announced cases a month ago and sparked growing public concern after a handful of prominent activists contracted the illness. Among them was student leader Panusaya ‚ÄúRung‚Äù Sithijirawattanakul, who helped lead a series of rallies last year demanding political reforms in the kingdom, and who tested positive after she was released on bail. The Thai prison population stood at around 311,000 earlier this year, the International Federation for Human Rights said ‚Äì more than two and a half times the system‚Äôs official capacity. Four inmates in every five are serving time for drug charges because of harsh anti-narcotics laws that can see offenders jailed for a decade for possessing just a few methamphetamine pills. Many cells are so packed with bodies that some inmates only have half a metre (less than 2ft) of space. ‚ÄúThat is less room for a body than the inside of a coffin,‚Äù justice minister Somsak Thepsutin told local media in February. Officials have tested more than 36,000 inmates in recent weeks and begun delivering Covid vaccines to inmates and prison staff. Somsak said he was examining ways to give early releases to prisoners with underlying medical conditions, possibly through a royal pardon. Even if the plan goes ahead, prisoners will still have to complete a quarantine before returning home. India has recorded the lowest number of new daily infections in 45 days, the Times of India reports, although a further 173,790 fresh cases were logged in the country on Saturday. The official death toll climbed to 322,512 as a further 3,617 Covid fatalities recorded on Saturday, according to health ministry data. Daily recoveries continue to outnumber the daily new cases for the 16th consecutive day. A total of 2,080,048 samples were tested in the last 24 hours, according to the Indian Council of Medical Research. The governing civic body of Mumbai on Friday allowed walk-in vaccination for students who have been accepted for university courses abroad and require immunisation to travel. France‚Äôs budget deficit for 2021 will stand at ‚Ç¨220bn, some ‚Ç¨47bn higher than previously estimated, Olivier Dussopt, the public accounts minister, told AFP on Saturday. The increase is ‚Äúa result of supporting measures that we‚Äôre continuing to take to support the recovery‚Äù from the devastating effects that Covid-19 shutdowns wreaked on the eurozone‚Äôs second-largest economy, he said. It is not yet clear how the revised numbers will affect the budget deficit when expressed as percentage of GDP, which was previously forecast to hit 9% this year, a postwar record. Public debt was previously forecast to reach 118% of GDP. The Covid-19 pandemic is expected to cost the French state nearly half a trillion euros over three years - ‚Ç¨158bn in 2020, an expected ‚Ç¨171bn in 2021 and a forecast ‚Ç¨96bn in 2022, Dussopt said in April. France has borrowed heavily to try to keep the economy afloat through three nationwide lockdowns, including money spent on supporting salaries of people furloughed and aid for companies struggling to stay afloat during the crisis. The southern Chinese city of Guangzhou shut down a neighborhood and ordered its residents to stay home on Saturday for door-to-door coronavirus testing following an upsurge in infections. Guangzhou, a business and industrial centre of 15 million people north of Hong Hong, has reported 20 new infections over the past week. The number is small compared with India‚Äôs thousands of daily cases but has alarmed Chinese authorities who believed they had the virus under control. The spread of infections was ‚Äúfast and strong,‚Äù the Global Times newspaper cited health authorities as saying. Saturday‚Äôs order to stay home applied to residents of five streets in Liwan district in the city centre. Outdoor markets, childcare centres and entertainment venues were closed. Indoor restaurant dining was prohibited, while grade schools were told to stop in-person tuition. People in parts of four nearby districts were ordered to limit outdoor activity. The city government earlier ordered testing of hundreds of thousands of residents following the initial infections. The government said some 700,000 people had been tested by Wednesday. China reports a handful of new cases every day but says almost all are believed to be people who were infected abroad, the Associated Press reports. The mainland‚Äôs official death toll stands at 4,636 out of 91,061 confirmed cases. On Saturday, the National Health Commission reported two new locally transmitted cases in Guangzhou and 14 in other parts of the country that it said came from abroad. Most of the latest infections in Guangzhou are believed to be linked to a 75-year-old woman who was found on 21 May to have the variant first identified in India, state media say. Most of the others attended a dinner with her or live together. That infection spread to the nearby city of Nanshan, where one new confirmed case and two asymptomatic cases were reported Saturday after people from Guangzhou were tested, according to the Global Times. Infections in Germany continue on a downward trend, according to the country‚Äôs Robert Koch Institute (RKI), with health authorities having reported 5,426 new cases within one day to the institute, down from 6,419 a week earlier. The seven-day incidence on Saturday morning stood at 37.5 nationwide, down from 39.8 on Friday and 66.8 in the previous week. Public holidays have, however, resulted in fewer people seeing a doctor, which means fewer samples are taken and fewer laboratory tests. Therefore, fewer new infections are reported. According to the RKI, 163 new deaths were recorded across Germany within 24 hours. A week ago 170 deaths from the virus were logged. The RKI has counted 3,675,296 Covid-19 infections since the beginning of the pandemic, but the actual total number is likely significantly higher, since many infections are not detected. The Philippines said on Saturday people were allowed to again go to work in Saudi Arabia, reversing a brief deployment ban after the kingdom said they would not be charged for Covid-19 tests and quarantine upon arrival. Reuters reports: ‚ÄúOur Saudi-bound workers will no longer be disadvantaged,‚Äù said labour secretary, Silvestre Bello. Flag carrier Philippine Airlines said it would accept Filipino workers on flights to Dammam and Riyadh, waiving rebooking fees for passengers who had been unable to board because of the deployment ban. Bello apologised for the ‚Äúinconvenience and momentary anguish‚Äù caused by his Thursday ban, saying: ‚ÄúI understand that the suspension order drew confusion and irritation among our affected departing overseas Filipino workers.‚Äù More than a million Filipinos work in Saudi Arabia, the most preferred destination of overseas Filipino workers in 2019, government data shows. Many Filipinos are hired as construction workers, domestic helpers or nurses. In 2020, Filipinos in Saudi Arabia sent home $1.8bn in remittances, a key support for the consumption-led economy. With more than 1.2 million cases and 20,722 deaths, the Philippines has the second-highest Covid-19 infections and casualties in south-east Asia, behind Indonesia. People should be ‚Äúvery concerned‚Äù about the spread of the Indian variant of coronavirus, but ‚Äúreassured‚Äù by the scale of the vaccine rollout, an expert has said. Professor Anthony Harnden, deputy chair of the UK‚Äôs Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), told BBC Breakfast that the variant was ‚Äúclearly more transmissible‚Äù. He said: We need to be reassured that we‚Äôre in a very different position now in that we‚Äôve got a highly vaccinated population and we just need to continue moving at speed. We do know that with this particular variant you do need two doses to offer complete protection, and so we‚Äôre very, very keen to make sure that all those, particularly higher risk groups, that‚Äôs the over-50s and those with underlying illness, receive their second vaccination as soon as feasible. The unlocking of society in England will be a ‚Äúgradual process‚Äù that requires a ‚Äúcautious‚Äù approach even if the government‚Äôs target date for removing all legal limits on social contact in the country on 21 June remains in place, he added, emphasising the need to ‚Äúlook very carefully‚Äù at what happens with the India variant in the next one or two weeks. He said: I think we need to look at that data very carefully before we completely un-lockdown. He suggested it was ‚Äúbetter‚Äù to be on ‚Äúthe cautious side‚Äù, adding: Even if we do un-lockdown, if you are in a vulnerable position, particularly if you‚Äôve not been vaccinated, you do need to carry on being cautious, even if the 21 June date goes ahead. So I think we‚Äôve all got used to living within boundaries at the moment and I think it‚Äôs not an all or none, I think it will be a gradual process even if the 21 June date goes ahead. Scotland‚Äôs health secretary Humza Yousaf said there was ‚Äúsignificant community transmission‚Äù of coronavirus in hotspots in the city of Glasgow. The city will remain under level 3 of Scotland‚Äôs restrictions until at least 5 June and Yousaf said urgent work was being carried out to understand the outbreak in south Glasgow and how the India variant arrived. He told BBC Radio 4‚Äôs Today: In a few concentrated hotspots ... we are seeing significant community transmission. The levels and the numbers of cases are continuing to rise. In other parts of the country ‚Äúlocal health teams tell us they are relatively contained outbreaks‚Äù linked to either schools or domestic clusters, but that was not the case in Glasgow. What we are seeing is it‚Äôs coming in in areas where there is a large, diverse community so therefore there is a probability the variant has come in from international travel. Therefore we are trying to get to the bottom of how it managed to get in. Victoria state in Australia has recorded five new locally acquired cases of coronavirus, with four linked to a food distribution delivery driver, as the state enters its second day of its fourth lockdown. The update brings the total number of cases from the latest outbreak in Melbourne to 35. A record 56,624 tests were conducted in the 24 hours to Saturday morning, surpassing the previous day‚Äôs record of 47,462 tests. On Saturday, the state‚Äôs Covid testing commander, Jeroen Weimar, said four of the new cases were linked to a person who tested positive on Friday. The Victorian health minister, Martin Foley, said the person was a food distribution delivery driver who visited ‚Äúmultiple stores and grocery sites across metropolitan Melbourne on 18 and 19 May‚Äù. There are now more than 150 exposure sites and more than 15,000 primary and secondary contacts who must self-isolate after coming into potential contact with a person with Covid-19. Foley said the individual ‚Äúworked during their infectious period‚Äù but they ‚Äúshowed no signs of Covid symptoms themselves‚Äù. He also thanked the food distribution company and customers for working with contact tracers. Weimar said four of the new cases announced on Saturday were household contacts of the delivery driver, including a student at Mount Ridley college in Craigieburn. He said these four people had only been in isolation for one day. The fifth case was separate, and was an employee of firm Stratton Finance who became infected at a display home in Mickleham. Late on Friday the Victorian health department announced new tier 1 exposure sites ‚Äì where people are most at risk of catching and spreading the virus. A full list of exposure sites can be found here. Foley announced what he called a ‚Äúhat-trick of records‚Äù, as the state administered a record number of tests and vaccinations over the past three days. Taiwan reported 486 new domestic Covid-19 cases on Saturday, including 166 cases added to the totals for recent days as it continues to readjust its infection numbers following delays in reporting positive tests. After successfully keeping coronavirus at bay, Taiwan is currently in the grip of its first serious outbreak. The island is desperately seeking vaccines to protect its people, and Taiwan‚Äôs neighbour China has offered to help, the BBC reported. Up until the mid-May, the country had logged only around 1,500 infections and 12 deaths, before cases began to rise sharply. On Tuesday, health minister Chen Shih-chung announced 2m vaccine doses would arrive in Taiwan in June, and 10m by the end of August. Russia reported 9,289 new Covid-19 cases on Saturday, including 3,241 in Moscow, taking the official national tally since the pandemic began to 5,053,748. The government coronavirus task force said 401 people had died of coronavirus-linked causes in the past 24 hours, pushing the national death toll to 120,807. The federal statistics agency has kept a separate count and has said Russia recorded around 250,000 deaths related to Covid-19 from April 2020 to March 2021. Malaysia reported 9,020 new coronavirus cases on Saturday, the highest daily toll since the start of the pandemic. This is the fifth straight day of record new infections, bringing the total number of cases in the country to 558,534. The country‚Äôs prime minister, Muhyiddin Yassin, has announced a nationwide ‚Äútotal lockdown‚Äù from 1 to 14 June that will apply to all social and economic areas, with only essential services and economic sectors listed by the national security council remaining in operation, ABC reports. ‚ÄúWith the latest rise in daily cases showing a drastically upward trend, hospital capacity across the country to treat Covid-19 patients are becoming limited,‚Äù Muhyiddin said in a statement. Prof Stephen Reicher, a psychologist on the UK‚Äôs Sage sub-committee advising the government on behavioural science, said ‚Äúconfusion‚Äù over the government‚Äôs approach was undermining efforts to control the pandemic. Ahead of the planned 21 June easing of restrictions in England, he said the government was in a ‚Äúpickle‚Äù because it appeared to have abandoned the ‚Äúdata, not dates‚Äù principle. He told BBC Radio 4‚Äôs Today: The data we are seeing at the moment suggests we have a problem. We don‚Äôt know how big the problem is - it might be bad, it might be very bad, we will learn in the next week or two. But the problem for the government is: on the one hand it can‚Äôt delay what it has been promising for so long, but on the other hand it is aware of the dangers of so doing. And so you see that in the fact that they are beginning to act in a rather contradictory way. They‚Äôre saying to us, for instance on travel: ‚Äòyou can travel internationally but please don‚Äôt‚Äô. They say of social contact ‚Äòyou can hug, but please don‚Äôt hug‚Äô. They say of restrictions, ‚Äòno restrictions but please don‚Äôt go in and out of the hotspots‚Äô. That contradiction, that sense of confusion, I think is undermining the response. Hello and welcome to our global coronavirus live blog. Vietnam health minister Nguyen Thanh Long said on Saturday the country has detected a new variant of the coronavirus, which is a mix of the India and UK Covid-19 variants and spreads quickly by air, online newspaper VnExpress reported. Vietnam‚Äôs latest coronavirus wave, which began about a month ago, has seen 3,595 local Covid-19 cases so far in 33 cities and provinces. He said the coronavirus responsible for the new wave is much more transmissible, especially in the air. Viral cultures in the laboratory revealed that the virus replicated itself very quickly, he added, explaining why there are so many new cases in different locations in a shorter time frame. So far, Vietnam has recorded the presence of seven coronavirus variants, including ones from the UK, India and South Africa.

Caution is needed in determining whether England‚Äôs coronavirus restrictions can be lifted next month or ‚Äúthings will get bad very, very quickly‚Äù, a professor whose argument against herd immunity helped trigger the first lockdown has warned. Sir Tim Gowers, a professor of mathematics at the University of Cambridge, told the Guardian the downside of being ‚Äúa bit more cautious‚Äù was a lot smaller than the downside of getting it wrong, as UK Covid cases rose by 4,184 on Friday ‚Äì the highest increase since 1 April. Asked about the next step in lockdown easing in England, due on June 21, Prof Gowers said he did not believe the plans were necessarily at risk, but urged caution. He said: Because Boris Johnson has made a big thing about all the steps being irreversible, I think he‚Äôs put himself in a position where once he takes a step, he‚Äôll be extremely reluctant to reverse because that would be a big U-turn, an embarrassing climbdown. So I think if that‚Äôs the way you‚Äôre going to play things, then you should be very, very cautious about every step you take ... And maybe everything [will] be OK, maybe the number of people who are vaccinated will be just enough ... ‚ÄòR‚Äô will broadly speaking stay below one even with Indian variants. But if it‚Äôs not OK, we know, because of mathematics, that things will get bad very, very quickly. Or at least, maybe it won‚Äôt look that quick to start with, but it‚Äôll grow exponentially. So it‚Äôll pick up speed and become a big problem. Read my colleague Ben Quinn‚Äôs full story here. Prof Christina Pagel, a member of Independent Sage from University College London, said reopening should be delayed a few more months.","charCount":"24132","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/clea-skopeliti\">Clea Skopeliti</a> (now) and <a href=\"profile/jedidajah-otte\">Jedidajah Otte</a> (earlier)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2021/may/29/his-fair-lady-how-george-bernard-shaws-wife-played-a-vital-role-in-his-masterworks","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-29T11:45:38Z","webTitle":"His fair lady: how George Bernard Shaw‚Äôs wife played a vital role in his masterworks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/may/29/his-fair-lady-how-george-bernard-shaws-wife-played-a-vital-role-in-his-masterworks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2021/may/29/his-fair-lady-how-george-bernard-shaws-wife-played-a-vital-role-in-his-masterworks","fields":{"headline":"His fair lady: how George Bernard Shaw‚Äôs wife played a vital role in his masterworks","standfirst":"<p>Charlotte‚Äôs influence has been downplayed, says a new book on how women are written out of history</p>","trailText":"Charlotte‚Äôs influence has been downplayed, says a new book on how women are written out of history","byline":"Donna Ferguson","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f392a5b76d1a16ca6ad9eba3dbf7110a951c387\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f392a5b76d1a16ca6ad9eba3dbf7110a951c387/0_81_3508_2104/1000.jpg\" alt=\"George Bernard Shaw and his wife, Charlotte, returning to Southampton on board the Arandora after a round-the-world trip in 1936.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">George Bernard Shaw and his wife, Charlotte, returning to Southampton on board the Arandora after a round-the-world trip in 1936.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gamma-Keystone-France/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>In the climactic final scene of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/bernardshaw\" title=\"\">George Bernard Shaw</a>‚Äôs masterpiece <em>Pygmalion</em>, Henry Higgins famously threatens to wring Eliza Doolittle‚Äôs neck. ‚ÄúWring away!‚Äù she replies. ‚ÄúOh, when I think of myself crawling under your feet and being trampled on and called names, when all the time I had only to lift up my finger to be as good as you, I could just kick myself.‚Äù</p> <p>Until now, Shaw‚Äôs play about the flower girl who is transformed into a duchess by a wealthy professor was thought to have little in common with the great playwright‚Äôs own life.

For its first new production of the season, Glyndebourne has turned this darkest of operas into a dazzle of white light and painful lucidity. Negating literal details of Czech village, church, countryside, the director <a href=\"https://imgartists.com/roster/damiano-michieletto/\">Damiano Michieletto</a> and designer Paolo Fantin have laid bare K√°≈•a‚Äôs troubled mental state and translated brutal action into metaphor.</p> <p>The set looks airy and minimal, K√°≈•a‚Äôs sense of imprisonment and desire for freedom achieved by Alessandro Carletti‚Äôs intense use of lighting and high white walls that shut out the world. Three standard visual motifs, drawn from references in the libretto, are brought into play: bird, cage and angel. Magritte‚Äôs disturbing birdcage paintings, one of which he pointedly called <em><a href=\"http://www.rene-magritte.com/therapist/\">The Therapist</a></em>, come to mind.

As her lover, Boris, <a href=\"https://www.intermusica.co.uk/artist/David-Butt-Philip\">David Butt Philip</a>, in sterling voice, managed to be attractive, hubristic and feckless ‚Äì no easy combination.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Opera or symphonic music can go big, in arena or open-air venue.

For its first new production of the season, Glyndebourne has turned this darkest of operas into a dazzle of white light and painful lucidity. Negating literal details of Czech village, church, countryside, the director Damiano Michieletto and designer Paolo Fantin have laid bare K√°≈•a‚Äôs troubled mental state and translated brutal action into metaphor. The set looks airy and minimal, K√°≈•a‚Äôs sense of imprisonment and desire for freedom achieved by Alessandro Carletti‚Äôs intense use of lighting and high white walls that shut out the world. Three standard visual motifs, drawn from references in the libretto, are brought into play: bird, cage and angel. Magritte‚Äôs disturbing birdcage paintings, one of which he pointedly called The Therapist, come to mind. By the end, these symbols have multiplied to the point of distraction. This might irritate more had musical standards not been so outstanding in every quarter, steered by Glyndebourne‚Äôs music director, Robin Ticciati. The central quartet, capturing Jan√°ƒçek‚Äôs distinctive speech melodies, interacted with characterful assurance: the soprano Kate≈ôina Knƒõ≈æ√≠kov√°, ablaze with musical intelligence in the title role, teetered between fragility, recklessness and strength; tenor Nicky Spence, ideally suited vocally to this high-lying repertoire, elicited sympathy as well as disgust as her downtrodden, drunken husband, Tichon. As her lover, Boris, David Butt Philip, in sterling voice, managed to be attractive, hubristic and feckless ‚Äì no easy combination. At the centre is K√°≈•a‚Äôs mother-in-law, Kabanicha, ever the oppressive puppeteer. The mezzo-soprano Katarina Dalayman mesmerised: harsh, sanctimonious and, as the action reveals, phoney. Aigul Akhmetshina as Varvara and Thomas Atkins as the schoolteacher, Kudrja≈°, made a fetching couple, leading a worthy supporting cast and chorus. In Tony Burke‚Äôs reduced orchestration, the score had an extra sense of space and luminosity. Whether in noisy brass volleys or limpid harp passages, or anywhere between these extremes, the London Philharmonic Orchestra played with incision and passion. This 2021 festival is dedicated to Mary Christie, for six decades, until her death last year, the gracious chatelaine of Glyndebourne. Her menfolk ‚Äì father-in-law John Christie, husband George and now son Gus ‚Äì may have been official figureheads in this family affair. She was the welcoming spirit, and far more than that.

They say UK medical authorities, who are currently studying how vaccines for adolescents might be administered, should move with great care over the implementation of such a programme. They acknowledge it could help reduce outbreaks and the spread of Covid but also warn it could also raise important practical and ethical problems. Doctors would be giving vaccines for which there was limited information about possible side-effects to children who have nothing to gain from such a move, said Professor Adam Finn of Bristol University. ‚ÄúChildren transmit Covid to some extent, although they rarely suffer badly from the disease themselves. If you offer them vaccines, then you put them at risk of possible side-effects ‚Äì so there really needs to be some significant, tangible benefit to them, not just the indirect protection of adults from Covid-19.‚Äù The preparation of plans to give Covid vaccines to UK children comes in the wake of the US decision to launch such a programme and at a time when Germany has indicated it is planning a similar move. Canada and Switzerland have also approved plans, while the European Medicines Agency (EMA) last week agreed to extend approval for the use of the Pfizer vaccine on 12- to 15-year-olds. But the move to vaccinate children has been criticised by global health leaders, including the head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who earlier this month said that although he understood why some countries wanted to vaccinate children and adolescents, he urged them to reconsider. ‚ÄúIn low and lower-middle income countries, Covid-19 vaccine supply has not been enough to even immunise healthcare workers, and hospitals are being inundated with people who need lifesaving care urgently,‚Äù he said. This point was backed by Professor Peter Openshaw of Imperial College London. He said there was now ‚Äúa very important argument to be had about the ethics of devoting all of these vaccines to our own population when we could be sharing them with the rest of the world‚Äù. In the US ‚Äì which has led the way in giving Covid vaccines to children ‚Äì this action has been taken, in part, as a response to vaccine hesitancy there, added Finn. ‚ÄúIn America they‚Äôve got lots of vaccine but fewer people willing to be vaccinated, so immunising children may be seen as one way of increasing population immunity. ‚ÄúHowever, it is probable they may still end up with higher proportions of unvaccinated people in certain communities and that could sustain outbreaks.

In the spring of 2016, Fauzia was taken to hospital twice and each time she stayed in intensive care for days on end. Her doctors conducted tests, drew up hypotheses, disproved them, and called in more doctors until her medical team was engorged with expertise but no closer to a diagnosis.</p> <p>‚ÄòThe mystery remained even as we were told to gather around her bed in the ICU on 9 June 2016. After she had died, when my mother and I prised out the needles that the nurses hadn‚Äôt taken from her neck and wrist, she continued to bleed. My mother, a British Pakistani Muslim who practises her faith quietly but assiduously, whispered the Qur‚Äôanic surah <em>Yaseen</em><em> </em>in her right ear and told me she had seen a tiny black pearl slip out from under Fauzia‚Äôs eyelid ‚Äì a single jewel of a tear ‚Äì which she had caught in the palm of her hand just before it disappeared, along with my sister‚Äôs soul. It was a sign, she said, a parting gift from her firstborn child, who was also the first to die.</p> <p>I could see nothing of death in Fauzia as the bright red bubbles of life streamed out of her veins when we removed the needles. A horrible kind of magical thinking gripped my mind in the days that followed. I wondered if she was dead at all or if the doctors had misjudged this, too, assuming death when she was in a deep slumber, a modern gothic Sleeping Beauty.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ab6d6f81ebacd0b0dc2f61133ae26d35c7b68e2b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab6d6f81ebacd0b0dc2f61133ae26d35c7b68e2b/0_648_2286_2472/925.jpg\" alt=\"Fauzia (left), aged seven, and Arifa, aged four, at their grandparents‚Äô house in Lahore, Pakistan, 1976.\" width=\"925\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fauzia (left), aged seven, and Arifa, aged four, at their grandparents‚Äô house in Lahore, Pakistan, 1976.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Arifa Akbar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Six months earlier, Fauzia had begun complaining of chest pains and heavy night sweats to her GP, but her X-rays had come back clear. Then her face swelled. She was taken to A&amp;E and tested for jaundice and meningitis. Doctors said she had a blood infection they couldn‚Äôt yet identify. She discharged herself, growing impatient with their investigations, but was unable to breathe properly a few days later and was taken back to hospital. She was given steroids and appeared to get better, so they discharged her after 11 days. But the following month she was back in intensive care, for two weeks this time, weaker than ever with inflamed lungs, slurred speech and strange behaviour, which we were later told was due to brain swelling. She was so ill that doctors put her into an induced coma and carried out more investigations. Still no diagnosis.</p> <p>And then she had a brain haemorrhage. It had started at around 5am on 9 June, the doctor told us when we rushed to the hospital later that morning. Some hours later, after a brain scan, they realised it had been catastrophic, but they still couldn‚Äôt name her illness. I wondered if it was a deadly new virus that lay on the outer reaches of medical science. We were told that in these circumstances, they could only declare someone dead after 24 hours. But there was no chance of recovery. </p> <p>We were left dazed. Fauzia was not officially dead, but not alive either. However surreal it sounded, the semantic limbo gave me 24 hours of hope. If her illness had been so mysterious, her recovery could be, too. I turned to my mother, the believer in all unseen matter, and put it to her, but she looked small and silent, already sunken by grief.</p> <p>The next day, Fauzia was moved from the open ward to a private area. A friendly nurse greeted me and told me to put on PPE. I had no idea she was in the room alone because she was being isolated. The nurse and I got chatting and I told him how they still didn‚Äôt know what was wrong with Fauzia. He looked at the medical notes and told me that there <em>was </em>a diagnosis.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>I grew up on stories of my father‚Äôs cruelty towards Fauzia. He would pull her hair, say he couldn‚Äôt stand looking at her</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>‚ÄúA diagnosis?‚Äù It seemed unbelievable that her elusive illness had been pinned down overnight, just as my sister had entered the holding cell between life and death.</p> <p>‚ÄúTB,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúShe died from tuberculosis.‚Äù</p> <p>They had, I was later told, discovered it from retesting her spinal fluid from a lumbar puncture administered when she was still alive. They had not been looking for TB because they hadn‚Äôt thought of it as a possibility. But it had been there all along ‚Äì ‚Äúdisseminating‚Äù, we were later told, from her lungs to other organs through her blood or lymphatic system.</p> <p>Questions began to arise: when had they retested Fauzia‚Äôs spinal fluid ‚Äì after her haemorrhage or before? Why hadn‚Äôt they thought of TB when they saw her lungs were inflamed? An infectious-diseases doctor had stood by her bedside and told me that TB, which I thought had been all but eradicated in the UK, had made a comeback in recent times ‚Äì so why wasn‚Äôt it considered by the army of specialists? And was it just an awful coincidence that they had found a diagnosis the day before they switched off her ventilator?</p> <p>Fauzia had had a difficult life. She had been dealing with depression and an eating disorder since she was a teenager. It had ravaged much of her life, and brought her into close contact with the harsh bureaucracies of the medical and psychiatric professions. She often spoke of feeling that the system was letting her down or failing to understand her. It was a system, she claimed, that seemed set on distrusting and disbelieving her because of her mental health. Now it turned out that she had been as unlucky in death as in life.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Until I was five years old, my parents shuttled back and forth between London and Lahore, trying to decide where to live. I was born in London but they returned to Pakistan in 1975, when I was three, hoping to resettle. But by 1977, money was becoming an issue in our paternal grandparents‚Äô home, where we lived with our extended family. My father wasn‚Äôt earning anything while his brothers were all contributing to the running of the house. My sister and I were told abruptly that we were going back to England. I was appalled by the news.</p> <p>Moving to London in December 1977 contained its own slow-burn trauma. We had been removed from the extended family and found ourselves thrust into poverty. The Technicolor life of Lahore was lost, and all turned black and white.</p> <p>Fauzia was the only one of the three of us born in Pakistan and her early life was far less settled than mine. She didn‚Äôt meet our father until she was 13 months old because he was in London, trying to find a job before sending visas and air tickets for my mother and Fauzia to join him. They arrived in London on 23 October 1971. They landed at Heathrow to find that my father was late, so they waited in the arrivals lounge. My mother was dressed in a new <em>shalwar kameez</em><em> </em>and Fauzia in a party frock. He arrived in a car he had borrowed from a friend, and when he saw Fauzia he reached out to hold her, but she, not knowing who he was, cried and clung to our mother. He asked our mother why she was crying and tried again, but Fauzia turned her face away. After that his mood changed and he spoke sternly to her in the car, telling her <em>chup </em>‚Äì be quiet ‚Äì when she wouldn‚Äôt stop crying. Maybe he felt rejected in that first meeting, but it couldn‚Äôt and shouldn‚Äôt have set the tone for their entire relationship.</p> <p>When I was born, my father couldn‚Äôt stop marvelling at me, I‚Äôm told. Perhaps he saw me as the firstborn because he was there for my birth. Rather than hiding his favouritism, he made it explicit. He told me, volubly, that I was adored and special. I was the daughter who could do little wrong. Fauzia was the problem child long before she had done anything wrong. Even the arrival of a brother two years later didn‚Äôt dismantle my primacy in my father‚Äôs eyes.</p> <p>I grew up on stories of my father‚Äôs random cruelties towards Fauzia as a baby: of him making her mouth bleed by sticking his fingers into it and pulling at her cheeks, of shaking her and making her run alongside him, even when she grew breathless and tearful. My mother worried about leaving him alone with Fauzia. He would take any opportunity to tell her off, pull her hair, and say he couldn‚Äôt bear looking at her. Sometimes he refused to eat at the same table as her, so she would have to wait until he had finished. She would be blamed for the smallest misdemeanour and told that my misbehaviour or my brother‚Äôs was her doing because she was the eldest and had set a bad example.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"106f7fbad74f20a91b66c29f5e2a2721090167c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/106f7fbad74f20a91b66c29f5e2a2721090167c9/0_140_3264_1958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Arifa Akbar (left), and Fauzia at their parents‚Äô home in London, around 2005.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arifa (left) and Fauzia at their parents‚Äô home in London, around 2005.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Arifa Akbar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are no conflagratory set pieces of remembered violence from that time. My father just continued to treat Fauzia differently. I know now that his behaviour amounted to verbal and emotional abuse, but I couldn‚Äôt have named it as such then. Even now, it feels like I am betraying him, but it is correct to use that term. It still alarms me that family abuse can be so selective. The charges against Fauzia became normalised in our home. I suspect this is how some domestic abuse works: in pinpricks, pinches and a tsunami of micro-aggressions. It is what makes it so pernicious, and it is no less monstrous than scenes of bone-breaking violence.</p> <p>My heart hardened a little towards my father following Fauzia‚Äôs death, but it is not as simple as that, either. I have seen him suffer, too. For the past 15 years he has lived with dementia. He is alone now, visited at his nursing home by no family members other than me. It‚Äôs as if he is paying penance.</p> <p>His locked-in state makes any account of his actions unfair. I am painting pictures that he can‚Äôt challenge or correct. It would be easy to build an alternative narrative: that he was simply not as close to Fauzia as he was to me; that he was there to support her in adulthood; that he spent hours entertaining us as children. He loved us in different ways, he might say. Whatever the source of his complicated relationship with Fauzia, it is buried wordlessly inside him for ever.</p> <p>***</p> <p>When she was 16, Fauzia was moved upstairs to share a bedroom with me. This was when we started to become allies. We started discussing all the ways in which our parents had failed us: she spoke of our father‚Äôs unkindness towards her, and how differently he had treated me. She thought our mother had failed to protect her. I began to understand how different her childhood had been from mine. Fauzia also described her increasingly low moods, her sudden depressions.</p> <p>She became my closest friend, a knowing, supportive older sister whose warmth I took for granted but whose pain I felt as my own. Despite her depression, she had bottomless optimism when I needed to feel more confident about myself in the world. ‚Äú<em>Of course </em>you can do it, Arifa,‚Äù she‚Äôd say, in a sure voice, when I felt uncertain. ‚ÄúWhy would you even question yourself?‚Äù We bonded over books, and her tastes shaped mine to create a language of intimacy between us: talking about a certain novel or artist became a way of defining ourselves to each other, and to ourselves. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c5b0d453d09ca0f0afaecaf6c4d3ef7ea286f428\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5b0d453d09ca0f0afaecaf6c4d3ef7ea286f428/0_0_3372_4724/714.jpg\" alt=\"An artwork by Fauzia, one of a series found in her portfolio after her death.\" width=\"714\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An artwork by Fauzia, one of a series found in her portfolio after her death.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The  Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fauzia‚Äôs first major depression came in 1990, though none of us recognised it as such at the time. She had dropped out of her fine art foundation course, even though the course had meant everything to her. She was 19 and doing less and less, in a bathrobe most days and dragged down by paralysing lows. The depression seemed unknowable and monstrous. </p> <p>***</p> <p>My last meeting with Fauzia outside hospital was in May 2016. It was shortly after her first admission to A&amp;E in April. There had been four years of silence between us. We had argued on and off for decades but this time, I had been the one to pick the fight. I can‚Äôt remember what triggered it but I felt all my old unaired resentments rising to the surface over the course of a meal and I rounded on Fauzia to tell her I hated her, shouting the words before storming out of the home.</p> <p>Afterwards, my mother told me I needed to apologise, but I couldn‚Äôt because the anger, now out, was too big to put away and too irrational to explain. I was furious with her for her lifetime‚Äôs depression, for not being the sister she had once been, for making me feel like her oppressor when I had never betrayed her, and I felt it was <em>she </em>who had built up a narrative against me, calling me her bully when I had been her friend.</p> <p>In the years of icy silence between us, I had missed her company, her careful listening, her passion for things, even if I had stayed angry. I felt a weight lift after we met at A&amp;E in April, although a part of me remained apprehensive, because, however many fresh starts Fauzia and I had had, we always seemed to circle back to grudge-bearing and mutual resentment, either assigning ourselves our old identities or blaming each other for them. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f0fc268d852a0b95566d99ed0f181958f1903c61\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0fc268d852a0b95566d99ed0f181958f1903c61/0_0_4724_4020/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The inspiration for this watercolour and embroidery piece is Degas‚Äô dancers, but Fauzia has added her own elements.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"851\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The inspiration for this watercolour and embroidery piece is Degas‚Äô dancers, but Fauzia has added her own elements.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The  Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Everything changed between Fauzia and me when I left for university. I remember how on the day I caught the train to Edinburgh she wouldn‚Äôt talk to me. When I asked her to see me off at the station, she refused to change out of her dressing-gown. She behaved as if I had wronged her. I thought she was being unreasonable, but I felt twinges of guilt all the same for leaving. A few minutes before the train moved out of the station, I saw Fauzia running along the platform with a scroll of paper in her hand. She got to me in time and I rolled the paper open to find her favourite painting ‚Äì a still life of flowers in meticulous brush-strokes of oils in deep blues, purples and turquoises. It had been the only finished artwork she had taken to her art foundation admissions interview in 1989, and on its back she had written, ‚ÄúTo Arifa ‚Äì look ‚Äì my first great work of art!! Fauzia‚Äù. I felt elated. We were still the best of friends.</p> <p>Leaving home for university had meant leaving Fauzia when she was slowly falling apart. Did I abandon her? Was I, in fact, partly to blame for her depression? I felt these uneasy questions swarm wordlessly between us after I returned from Edinburgh. Maybe Fauzia planted them there. I suppose she had a right to do so: the legacy of having been my father‚Äôs favourite in childhood felt toxic when set against his brutal treatment of her. During my years away, Fauzia must have decided I had shown her cruelty, too, because she became snide and jeering when I returned.</p> <p>It grew difficult to be with her, even in the times when we weren‚Äôt arguing, because everything came back to her bigger pain. Her suffering was insurmountable, it seemed, and I was fed up with being implicated. </p> <p>***</p> <p>After being encouraged to go to a sewing class in her late 30s, she had returned to art school, at 43, and was midway through a fine art degree at Camberwell College of Arts, at which she was excelling, when she died.</p> <p>When we gathered together her innumerable sketchbooks and portfolios a few weeks after her death, I began to look for clues to her inner world. I had been reluctant to look for fear of seeing things that would be painful to acknowledge. I knew I would find clarification of so much about Fauzia, but I would also see the ways I had misjudged her.</p> <p>Looking at her art, I am surprised to find pictures of myself. In a sketchbook called ‚ÄúArtist‚Äôs Research‚Äù there is an image of me smiling and hugging our niece, one of our brother‚Äôs daughters. My eyes are open, my niece‚Äôs are squeezed shut with laughter. I recognise the image: it has been copied from a photograph taken in our mother‚Äôs home.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>In one image of me, small oddities make my face look grotesque. Below, she has cut out a single printed word: demon</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It becomes apparent that it is part of a project whose themes revolve around mythologies. There are seven more portraits of me, almost all in closeup, and most are on a double page, set against a classical painting featuring cherubim, biblical figures and saints drawn on the opposite side. I recognise each picture of myself from photographs that have been taken by the family. These images startle me for their likeness, but also the sense of being airbrushed in slight but significant ways. She has made my face more harmonious than it is ‚Äì my nose is smaller, the gap in my top teeth is gone. I realise, with some apprehension, that it is deliberate. There is something sad about her intentional smoothing away of my imperfections, but the idealised tone of the words accompanying the portraits saddens me more: ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs funny and honest!‚Äù is written under one.</p> <p>I turn the page. Another smiling image of me with writing beneath it: ‚ÄúShe is multifaceted, like all well-directed, hard-working human beings and her individuality is remarkable.‚Äù I look at my image and the saints on the opposite side of the sketchbook and it is clear I am being set beside the ideal. It goes on for several pages and the almost fantastical tone of the words is excruciating. I see in this the pain of being the ‚Äúother‚Äù sister. Here is my elevated status in the family as the perfect daughter, and in its absence, the position she was given as my opposite.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b1c7db8ae3f3f7532b2a529060c008aaf85cf9b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b1c7db8ae3f3f7532b2a529060c008aaf85cf9b3/0_0_4202_4724/890.jpg\" alt=\"This embroidered ‚Äòfinal confession‚Äô is reminiscent of a deathbed scene from an old painting.

Here I am alone, in even more magnified closeup, and I am not idealised now. I look <em>almost </em>like myself, but small oddities have been inserted that make my face look gothic and ever so slightly grotesque: my features bent, my nose long and bony, my chin witch-like. Below the images, she has cut out a single printed word, in capital letters, from a magazine. I stare at it, surprised at first, then reminded of all the ways in which we distrusted each other: ‚ÄúDEMON‚Äù.</p> <p>The word instantly casts the previous pictures in a new light. Here is what she was building to: my fall, from angel to devil. These last pictures remind me that, just as she was my demon sister for a time, destructive and dangerous in her anger, I was hers.

In the spring of 2016, Fauzia was taken to hospital twice and each time she stayed in intensive care for days on end. Her doctors conducted tests, drew up hypotheses, disproved them, and called in more doctors until her medical team was engorged with expertise but no closer to a diagnosis. ‚ÄòThe mystery remained even as we were told to gather around her bed in the ICU on 9 June 2016. After she had died, when my mother and I prised out the needles that the nurses hadn‚Äôt taken from her neck and wrist, she continued to bleed. My mother, a British Pakistani Muslim who practises her faith quietly but assiduously, whispered the Qur‚Äôanic surah Yaseen in her right ear and told me she had seen a tiny black pearl slip out from under Fauzia‚Äôs eyelid ‚Äì a single jewel of a tear ‚Äì which she had caught in the palm of her hand just before it disappeared, along with my sister‚Äôs soul. It was a sign, she said, a parting gift from her firstborn child, who was also the first to die. I could see nothing of death in Fauzia as the bright red bubbles of life streamed out of her veins when we removed the needles. A horrible kind of magical thinking gripped my mind in the days that followed. I wondered if she was dead at all or if the doctors had misjudged this, too, assuming death when she was in a deep slumber, a modern gothic Sleeping Beauty. Six months earlier, Fauzia had begun complaining of chest pains and heavy night sweats to her GP, but her X-rays had come back clear. Then her face swelled. She was taken to A&amp;E and tested for jaundice and meningitis. Doctors said she had a blood infection they couldn‚Äôt yet identify. She discharged herself, growing impatient with their investigations, but was unable to breathe properly a few days later and was taken back to hospital. She was given steroids and appeared to get better, so they discharged her after 11 days. But the following month she was back in intensive care, for two weeks this time, weaker than ever with inflamed lungs, slurred speech and strange behaviour, which we were later told was due to brain swelling. She was so ill that doctors put her into an induced coma and carried out more investigations. Still no diagnosis. And then she had a brain haemorrhage. It had started at around 5am on 9 June, the doctor told us when we rushed to the hospital later that morning. Some hours later, after a brain scan, they realised it had been catastrophic, but they still couldn‚Äôt name her illness. I wondered if it was a deadly new virus that lay on the outer reaches of medical science. We were told that in these circumstances, they could only declare someone dead after 24 hours. But there was no chance of recovery. We were left dazed. Fauzia was not officially dead, but not alive either. However surreal it sounded, the semantic limbo gave me 24 hours of hope. If her illness had been so mysterious, her recovery could be, too. I turned to my mother, the believer in all unseen matter, and put it to her, but she looked small and silent, already sunken by grief. The next day, Fauzia was moved from the open ward to a private area. A friendly nurse greeted me and told me to put on PPE. I had no idea she was in the room alone because she was being isolated. The nurse and I got chatting and I told him how they still didn‚Äôt know what was wrong with Fauzia. He looked at the medical notes and told me that there was a diagnosis. ‚ÄúA diagnosis?‚Äù It seemed unbelievable that her elusive illness had been pinned down overnight, just as my sister had entered the holding cell between life and death. ‚ÄúTB,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúShe died from tuberculosis.‚Äù They had, I was later told, discovered it from retesting her spinal fluid from a lumbar puncture administered when she was still alive. They had not been looking for TB because they hadn‚Äôt thought of it as a possibility. But it had been there all along ‚Äì ‚Äúdisseminating‚Äù, we were later told, from her lungs to other organs through her blood or lymphatic system. Questions began to arise: when had they retested Fauzia‚Äôs spinal fluid ‚Äì after her haemorrhage or before? Why hadn‚Äôt they thought of TB when they saw her lungs were inflamed? An infectious-diseases doctor had stood by her bedside and told me that TB, which I thought had been all but eradicated in the UK, had made a comeback in recent times ‚Äì so why wasn‚Äôt it considered by the army of specialists? And was it just an awful coincidence that they had found a diagnosis the day before they switched off her ventilator? Fauzia had had a difficult life. She had been dealing with depression and an eating disorder since she was a teenager. It had ravaged much of her life, and brought her into close contact with the harsh bureaucracies of the medical and psychiatric professions. She often spoke of feeling that the system was letting her down or failing to understand her. It was a system, she claimed, that seemed set on distrusting and disbelieving her because of her mental health. Now it turned out that she had been as unlucky in death as in life. *** Until I was five years old, my parents shuttled back and forth between London and Lahore, trying to decide where to live. I was born in London but they returned to Pakistan in 1975, when I was three, hoping to resettle. But by 1977, money was becoming an issue in our paternal grandparents‚Äô home, where we lived with our extended family. My father wasn‚Äôt earning anything while his brothers were all contributing to the running of the house. My sister and I were told abruptly that we were going back to England. I was appalled by the news. Moving to London in December 1977 contained its own slow-burn trauma. We had been removed from the extended family and found ourselves thrust into poverty. The Technicolor life of Lahore was lost, and all turned black and white. Fauzia was the only one of the three of us born in Pakistan and her early life was far less settled than mine. She didn‚Äôt meet our father until she was 13 months old because he was in London, trying to find a job before sending visas and air tickets for my mother and Fauzia to join him. They arrived in London on 23 October 1971. They landed at Heathrow to find that my father was late, so they waited in the arrivals lounge. My mother was dressed in a new shalwar kameez and Fauzia in a party frock. He arrived in a car he had borrowed from a friend, and when he saw Fauzia he reached out to hold her, but she, not knowing who he was, cried and clung to our mother. He asked our mother why she was crying and tried again, but Fauzia turned her face away. After that his mood changed and he spoke sternly to her in the car, telling her chup ‚Äì be quiet ‚Äì when she wouldn‚Äôt stop crying. Maybe he felt rejected in that first meeting, but it couldn‚Äôt and shouldn‚Äôt have set the tone for their entire relationship. When I was born, my father couldn‚Äôt stop marvelling at me, I‚Äôm told. Perhaps he saw me as the firstborn because he was there for my birth. Rather than hiding his favouritism, he made it explicit. He told me, volubly, that I was adored and special. I was the daughter who could do little wrong. Fauzia was the problem child long before she had done anything wrong. Even the arrival of a brother two years later didn‚Äôt dismantle my primacy in my father‚Äôs eyes. I grew up on stories of my father‚Äôs random cruelties towards Fauzia as a baby: of him making her mouth bleed by sticking his fingers into it and pulling at her cheeks, of shaking her and making her run alongside him, even when she grew breathless and tearful. My mother worried about leaving him alone with Fauzia. He would take any opportunity to tell her off, pull her hair, and say he couldn‚Äôt bear looking at her. Sometimes he refused to eat at the same table as her, so she would have to wait until he had finished. She would be blamed for the smallest misdemeanour and told that my misbehaviour or my brother‚Äôs was her doing because she was the eldest and had set a bad example. There are no conflagratory set pieces of remembered violence from that time. My father just continued to treat Fauzia differently. I know now that his behaviour amounted to verbal and emotional abuse, but I couldn‚Äôt have named it as such then. Even now, it feels like I am betraying him, but it is correct to use that term. It still alarms me that family abuse can be so selective. The charges against Fauzia became normalised in our home. I suspect this is how some domestic abuse works: in pinpricks, pinches and a tsunami of micro-aggressions. It is what makes it so pernicious, and it is no less monstrous than scenes of bone-breaking violence. My heart hardened a little towards my father following Fauzia‚Äôs death, but it is not as simple as that, either. I have seen him suffer, too. For the past 15 years he has lived with dementia. He is alone now, visited at his nursing home by no family members other than me. It‚Äôs as if he is paying penance. His locked-in state makes any account of his actions unfair. I am painting pictures that he can‚Äôt challenge or correct. It would be easy to build an alternative narrative: that he was simply not as close to Fauzia as he was to me; that he was there to support her in adulthood; that he spent hours entertaining us as children. He loved us in different ways, he might say. Whatever the source of his complicated relationship with Fauzia, it is buried wordlessly inside him for ever. *** When she was 16, Fauzia was moved upstairs to share a bedroom with me. This was when we started to become allies. We started discussing all the ways in which our parents had failed us: she spoke of our father‚Äôs unkindness towards her, and how differently he had treated me. She thought our mother had failed to protect her. I began to understand how different her childhood had been from mine. Fauzia also described her increasingly low moods, her sudden depressions. She became my closest friend, a knowing, supportive older sister whose warmth I took for granted but whose pain I felt as my own. Despite her depression, she had bottomless optimism when I needed to feel more confident about myself in the world. ‚ÄúOf course you can do it, Arifa,‚Äù she‚Äôd say, in a sure voice, when I felt uncertain. ‚ÄúWhy would you even question yourself?‚Äù We bonded over books, and her tastes shaped mine to create a language of intimacy between us: talking about a certain novel or artist became a way of defining ourselves to each other, and to ourselves. Fauzia‚Äôs first major depression came in 1990, though none of us recognised it as such at the time. She had dropped out of her fine art foundation course, even though the course had meant everything to her. She was 19 and doing less and less, in a bathrobe most days and dragged down by paralysing lows. The depression seemed unknowable and monstrous. *** My last meeting with Fauzia outside hospital was in May 2016. It was shortly after her first admission to A&amp;E in April. There had been four years of silence between us. We had argued on and off for decades but this time, I had been the one to pick the fight. I can‚Äôt remember what triggered it but I felt all my old unaired resentments rising to the surface over the course of a meal and I rounded on Fauzia to tell her I hated her, shouting the words before storming out of the home. Afterwards, my mother told me I needed to apologise, but I couldn‚Äôt because the anger, now out, was too big to put away and too irrational to explain. I was furious with her for her lifetime‚Äôs depression, for not being the sister she had once been, for making me feel like her oppressor when I had never betrayed her, and I felt it was she who had built up a narrative against me, calling me her bully when I had been her friend. In the years of icy silence between us, I had missed her company, her careful listening, her passion for things, even if I had stayed angry. I felt a weight lift after we met at A&amp;E in April, although a part of me remained apprehensive, because, however many fresh starts Fauzia and I had had, we always seemed to circle back to grudge-bearing and mutual resentment, either assigning ourselves our old identities or blaming each other for them. Everything changed between Fauzia and me when I left for university. I remember how on the day I caught the train to Edinburgh she wouldn‚Äôt talk to me. When I asked her to see me off at the station, she refused to change out of her dressing-gown. She behaved as if I had wronged her. I thought she was being unreasonable, but I felt twinges of guilt all the same for leaving. A few minutes before the train moved out of the station, I saw Fauzia running along the platform with a scroll of paper in her hand. She got to me in time and I rolled the paper open to find her favourite painting ‚Äì a still life of flowers in meticulous brush-strokes of oils in deep blues, purples and turquoises. It had been the only finished artwork she had taken to her art foundation admissions interview in 1989, and on its back she had written, ‚ÄúTo Arifa ‚Äì look ‚Äì my first great work of art!! Fauzia‚Äù. I felt elated. We were still the best of friends. Leaving home for university had meant leaving Fauzia when she was slowly falling apart. Did I abandon her? Was I, in fact, partly to blame for her depression? I felt these uneasy questions swarm wordlessly between us after I returned from Edinburgh. Maybe Fauzia planted them there. I suppose she had a right to do so: the legacy of having been my father‚Äôs favourite in childhood felt toxic when set against his brutal treatment of her. During my years away, Fauzia must have decided I had shown her cruelty, too, because she became snide and jeering when I returned. It grew difficult to be with her, even in the times when we weren‚Äôt arguing, because everything came back to her bigger pain. Her suffering was insurmountable, it seemed, and I was fed up with being implicated. *** After being encouraged to go to a sewing class in her late 30s, she had returned to art school, at 43, and was midway through a fine art degree at Camberwell College of Arts, at which she was excelling, when she died. When we gathered together her innumerable sketchbooks and portfolios a few weeks after her death, I began to look for clues to her inner world. I had been reluctant to look for fear of seeing things that would be painful to acknowledge. I knew I would find clarification of so much about Fauzia, but I would also see the ways I had misjudged her. Looking at her art, I am surprised to find pictures of myself. In a sketchbook called ‚ÄúArtist‚Äôs Research‚Äù there is an image of me smiling and hugging our niece, one of our brother‚Äôs daughters. My eyes are open, my niece‚Äôs are squeezed shut with laughter. I recognise the image: it has been copied from a photograph taken in our mother‚Äôs home. It becomes apparent that it is part of a project whose themes revolve around mythologies. There are seven more portraits of me, almost all in closeup, and most are on a double page, set against a classical painting featuring cherubim, biblical figures and saints drawn on the opposite side. I recognise each picture of myself from photographs that have been taken by the family. These images startle me for their likeness, but also the sense of being airbrushed in slight but significant ways. She has made my face more harmonious than it is ‚Äì my nose is smaller, the gap in my top teeth is gone. I realise, with some apprehension, that it is deliberate. There is something sad about her intentional smoothing away of my imperfections, but the idealised tone of the words accompanying the portraits saddens me more: ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs funny and honest!‚Äù is written under one. I turn the page. Another smiling image of me with writing beneath it: ‚ÄúShe is multifaceted, like all well-directed, hard-working human beings and her individuality is remarkable.‚Äù I look at my image and the saints on the opposite side of the sketchbook and it is clear I am being set beside the ideal. It goes on for several pages and the almost fantastical tone of the words is excruciating. I see in this the pain of being the ‚Äúother‚Äù sister. Here is my elevated status in the family as the perfect daughter, and in its absence, the position she was given as my opposite. There are two final images of me that bring a stop to the whole project. Here I am alone, in even more magnified closeup, and I am not idealised now. I look almost like myself, but small oddities have been inserted that make my face look gothic and ever so slightly grotesque: my features bent, my nose long and bony, my chin witch-like. Below the images, she has cut out a single printed word, in capital letters, from a magazine. I stare at it, surprised at first, then reminded of all the ways in which we distrusted each other: ‚ÄúDEMON‚Äù. The word instantly casts the previous pictures in a new light. Here is what she was building to: my fall, from angel to devil. These last pictures remind me that, just as she was my demon sister for a time, destructive and dangerous in her anger, I was hers. It seems like a conclusion, somehow, but it was not the end of us, as sisters. I was not her demon sister at the end of her life, and she was not mine. We were reunited, two months before she died. I had gone to her hospital bed with a racing heart, hoping to see her alive, showing her I was still there for her. In the weeks and months after Fauzia‚Äôs death, we had to chase doctors repeatedly for a fuller explanation of why she had remained undiagnosed of an ancient infectious disease that might otherwise have been cured with a course of antibiotics. Two months after she died, we were finally sent a summarised report of her case, which made it clear how hard the doctors had tried, but also that there had been ‚Äúmissed opportunities‚Äù. Her form of TB had been relatively rare and difficult to detect, we were told. As I began reading around the illness, I discovered that it was often elusive in character, and could also lie dormant in the body for decades before awakening and attacking the system, slowly and stealthily, from within. For all the gains of medical science, TB remains the unknowable, or at least not fully known, contagion. I find myself thinking that we might have remained friends, had she lived. I wonder how she might have sketched me now, if I had sat for her myself. I hope I would not be the angel sister any more, or the demon, but wavering somewhere between, and that she would see me for the person I had become, with all the love and fear and flesh wounds of our sisterhood. ‚Ä¢ Arifa Akbar is the Guardian‚Äôs chief theatre critic.

Riccardo Chailly, recording his own Brahms set with the Gewandhaus players (2014), chose quicker tempi than Blomstedt, achieving a leaner urgency. Both offer rewards. In the Academic Festival Overture, the orchestra ‚Äì of which Brahms himself was once conductor ‚Äì plays with brilliant energy and finesse. ‚Ä¢ For an insider‚Äôs view about orchestral life behind the scenes, try the podcast LPO Off Stage, presented by the saxophonist YolanDa Brown. Lively and revealing insights into what musicians really think, and how one orchestra differs from another.","charCount":"2421","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"true","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/fiona-maddocks\">Fiona Maddocks</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"}]}}

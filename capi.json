Coco Gauff kicks things off on Philippe-Chatrier against Barbora Krejcikova.

In <strong>Nigeria</strong>, Africa’s biggest country with more than 200 million people, only 0.1% are fully protected. <strong>Kenya</strong>, with 50 million people, is even lower. <strong>Uganda</strong> has recalled doses from rural areas because it doesn’t have nearly enough to fight outbreaks in big cities.</p> <p><strong>Chad</strong> didn’t administer its first vaccine shots until this past weekend.

Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin’s administration imposed strict Covid-19 measures from June 1-14 to address a surge in infections and deaths, on top of an ongoing national emergency to curb the spread of the disease. But those have led to public frustration over a perceived slow rollout of vaccinations, haphazard policymaking and uneven enforcement of coronavirus curbs that critics say royalty and elites have been allowed to skirt. Opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, who spent an hour with King Al-Sultan Abdullah, said the national emergency has done more harm than good. “We presented our view that allowing this emergency to continue will lead to losses to the country,” Anwar told reporters. “It does not help with the handling of Covid and it effects the economy, especially those in the lower rungs of society.” Muhyiddin was the first to meet with the king, ahead of his weekly cabinet meeting. Other political leaders are expected at the palace over the next few days, including ex-premier Mahathir Mohamad. In a statement, the national palace said the king has convened a special meeting of the council of rulers on Wednesday to discuss efforts to battle the epidemic during the emergency. Intensive care beds for Covid patients in Malaysia have reached full capacity [see 6.11], according to the country’s health director general, who said the country’s pandemic remained at a critical level. My colleague Sarah Marsh has a recap here of those important words from NHS Providers chief executive, Chris Hopson, that the link between Covid cases and deaths has been broken. Three people were killed in a blaze that broke out at a Russian hospital treating patients with Covid-19, authorities said, with one official suggesting a faulty ventilator was to blame. The fire broke out in the early hours of Wednesday at a hospital in the city of Ryazan, some 180 kilometres (112 miles) from Moscow, in a ward treating Covid-19 patients. The region’s governor, Nikolai Lyubimov, told state television that a ventilator in the ward had overheated and caught fire, the Interfax news agency reported. Nurses attempted to extinguish the blaze, but were unsuccessful in doing so, with some of them sustaining severe burns, the governor said. Reuters note that since the start of the pandemic, Russia has reported several fires at intensive care units that doctors said were caused by malfunctioning ventilators used to treat patients severely ill with the virus. Andrew Sparrow has begun publishing our UK live blog for the day. I suspect there will be a lot of politics in it today. I’ll continue to have top UK lines as well as the global Covid news. Russia has reported 10,407 new coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours, its highest number of daily infections since early March, taking the national tally to 5,156,250 since the pandemic began. Regular readers will note that I’ve expressed some scepticism about how Russia’s official figures basically haven’t moved for months, which doesn’t feel like how the pandemic has behaved elsewhere. Reuters said the government coronavirus task force reported 399 people had died, pushing the national death toll to 124,895. The federal statistics agency has kept a separate toll and has said that Russia recorded around 270,000 deaths related to Covid-19 between April 2020 and April 2021. Gerald Imray reports for Associated Press from Cape Town that in South Africa, which has Africa’s most robust economy and its biggest coronavirus caseload, just 0.8% of the population is fully vaccinated. Hundreds of thousands of the country’s health workers, many of whom come face-to-face with the virus every day, are still waiting for their shots. The picture is similar with other African nations. In Nigeria, Africa’s biggest country with more than 200 million people, only 0.1% are fully protected. Kenya, with 50 million people, is even lower. Uganda has recalled doses from rural areas because it doesn’t have nearly enough to fight outbreaks in big cities. Chad didn’t administer its first vaccine shots until this past weekend. And there are at least five other countries in Africa where not one dose has been put into an arm, according to the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The World Health Organization says the continent of 1.3 billion people is facing a severe shortage of vaccine at the same time a new wave of infections is rising across Africa. Vaccine shipments into Africa have ground to a “near halt”, WHO said last week. In an interview, Nkengasong called on the leaders of wealthy nations meeting this week at the G7 summit to share spare vaccines – something the US has already agreed to do – and avert a “moral catastrophe”. “I’d like to believe that the G7 countries, most of them having kept excess doses of vaccines, want to be on the right side of history,” Nkengasong said. “Distribute those vaccines. We need to actually see these vaccines, not just … promises and goodwill.” Others are not so patient, nor so diplomatic. “People are dying. Time is against us. This IS INSANE,” South African human rights lawyer Fatima Hasan, an activist for equal access to health care, wrote in a series of text messages. NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson has told Times Radio this morning that vaccines appear to have “broken” the link between infections, hospital admission and deaths in the UK, and hospitals were reporting less sick, younger patients than before. He added: “And if, and it is a big if, if Bolton has gone through its complete cycle and if others areas follow Bolton, the view from the hospital there was that they were able to cope with the level of infections. “It’s important not to just focus on the raw numbers here … you also do need to look at who’s being admitted into hospital and how clinically vulnerable and what level of acuity they’ve got. “What chief executives are consistently telling us is that it is a much younger population that is coming in, they are less clinically vulnerable, they are less in need of critical care and therefore they’re seeing what they believe is significantly lower mortality rate which is, you know, borne out by the figures. So it’s not just the numbers of people who are coming in, it’s actually the level of harm and clinical risk.” However, PA Media reports he said those people who are admitted but survive may still end up with long Covid. Taiwan has reported 274 new local cases of Covid-19 today, mostly in New Taipei city. Another 25 people have died, bringing Taiwan’s total death toll to 296. Health authorities have just given their daily update, and the numbers are higher than the previous two days but lower than last week. There are currently 2,542 people in hospital and 1,486 with milder cases in centralised quarantine facilities. More than 10% of deaths – which have skewed older in this outbreak – occurred before the patient got to hospital, Testing capacity has also increased, with the ability for 48,000 PCR tests a day, up from 27,600. Health and welfare minister Chen Shih-chung has also reminded local governments that they should be following the protocols established under alert level 3, which limits gatherings and closes some shops, but doesn’t lock people inside. He made the comments in response to reports of the Miaoli county government ordering migrant workers be kept to their dorms and not allowed out except to go to work. A growing cluster of hundreds of cases across four factories is quickly becoming the new focus of this outbreak, and there are a lot of allegations around that migrant workers – of whom there are around 430,000 in the manufacturing industry primarily living in dormitories – are being treated at a different standard to Taiwanese employees. There is some pushback on the government’s handling of this outbreak, including its preparations for the known risk of outbreaks in migrant worker dorms, and over the level 3 rules for the general public. Employers are still only encouraged to facilitate working from home, and there are wide reports that many are still making workers go in - even if not strictly necessary. Meanwhile outdoor areas are closed. Dr David Nabarro, special envoy on Covid-19 for the World Health Organization, has said British prime minister Boris Johnson’s commitment to vaccinating the entire world by the end of next year could be a “gift for generations to come”. “I am absolutely delighted that the British prime minister has made this call to action for the world to get vaccinated by the end of next year,” he told Sky News.“And he’s going to use his leadership of the G7 group of nations to make this point. “So I think like many, I am hoping that world leaders in the G7 will just say very clearly: ‘We are going to work together to make sure that the world is vaccinated adequately by the end of 2022’. That would be a gift for generations to come. And it’s the kind of leadership that really we’re expecting and hoping to see in the coming weeks.” He added: “The reality is that it will be a massive undertaking to ensure that everybody has access to a vaccine, it will be a massive undertaking to make sure that enough vaccine is available and the vaccines are constantly modified in the light of new variants emerging. But this is doable. “It’s not in the big scheme of things a massive expenditure, it just requires everybody saying we’re going to work together on this job.” Nabarro may have over-estimated not only the extent to which Boris Johnson habitually sees his grand projects through to the end – garden bridge anyone? – but also under-estimated practicalities of it. Yesterday my colleague Sarah Boseley assessed how feasible it might be… The mayor of Greater Manchester in England, Andy Burnham, has offered a rare bit of praise to the government for “surging support” into areas where there are high case numbers after health secretary Matt Hancock announced that a “strengthened package of support” will be provided for Greater Manchester and Lancashire. “We very much appreciate the help of the government. It’s a reversal of where we were last year,” he said on BBC Breakfast. “Then we were getting restrictions put on us without support. This is an approach where the restrictions are being managed nationally through the road map. We’ve been working closely with the government on this. It’s a sensible approach and we support it.” Burnham has encouraged residents in parts of Lancashire and Greater Manchester to “minimise” the number of people they watch England’s Euro 2020 match against Croatia with this weekend after a rise in coronavirus cases in the areas. PA report he said: “If you look to this weekend with the weather looking good in Greater Manchester, which is great for everybody with the football coming, we would say minimise the number of people you watch the match with. Watch it outside if you can.” Burnham has also been on the Radio 4 Today programme, where he is been making the point that surge vaccinations could provide a key route out of the local restrictions that areas of the north-west of England are being asked to follow. There’s already been some pushback on that investigation by the CMA into the refund policies of British Airways and Ryanair, as you might imagine. PA Media is reporting that a spokeswoman for British Airways said the company has issued more than 3m refunds. They added: “We continue to offer highly flexible booking policies at the same time as operating a vastly reduced schedule due to government-imposed travel restrictions, and we have acted lawfully at all times. “It is incredible that the government is seeking to punish further an industry that is on its knees, after prohibiting airlines from meaningful flying for well over a year now. “Any action taken against our industry will only serve to destabilise it, with potential consequences for jobs, business, connectivity and the UK economy.” The UK’s competition watchdog has launched action against British Airways and Ryanair over their refusal to give refunds to people during UK lockdowns, when they were “lawfully unable to fly” due to travel bans and restrictions imposed by the government. BA offered vouchers or rebooking and Ryanair only the option to rebook. The Competition and Markets Authority started an investigation in December. It said this morning it is “concerned that, by failing to offer people their money back, both firms may have breached consumer law and left people unfairly out of pocket. It is now seeking to resolve these concerns with the companies, which may include seeking refunds, or other redress, for affected customers”. This relates to “periods when it was unlawful in one or more parts of the UK for people to travel for non-essential reasons. It covers flights that were not cancelled, and does not cover any other situations”. Andrea Coscelli, the chief executive of the CMA, said: While we understand that airlines have had a tough time during the pandemic, people should not be left unfairly out of pocket for following the law. Customers booked these flights in good faith and were legally unable to take them due to circumstances entirely outside of their control. We believe these people should have been offered their money back. My colleague Julia Kollewe will have more on this as it unfolds on our business live blog: UK’s CMA launches action against BA and Ryanair over refunds – business live UK government ministers could not justify spending millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money hiring consultants to assess applicants for its £500m Covid emergency support package for charities, despite clear bid processes already existing, according to cross-party MPs. Ministers were also unable to explain why a team of political special advisers was given an unusually central role in deciding which charities would receive funding, or why some charities received cash even though their bids initially received low scores. The public accounts committee (PAC) said there was a “notable opaqueness” surrounding decisions on how funds were distributed to charities, with little clarity about how the cash was shared regionally, or what impact it had. MPs were examining the £513m allocated to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) last year to provide financial support for charities to help them meet increased demand during the pandemic. An additional £200m went to hospice charities via the Department of Health and Social Care. The PAC chair, Meg Hillier, said that it was not the first time during the pandemic “worrying smoke” had been thrown up by ministers around Covid support funding decisions, with “growing instances of the official processes overridden without adequate explanations”. “Exorbitant funds” having been spent by consultants without the impact being measured was a recurring pandemic theme, she added. “I fear one clear impact is the steady erosion of taxpayers’ trust that their money is being well spent in this national emergency.” Read more of Patrick Butler’s report here: Millions spent on consultants for Covid scheme ‘not justified’, MPs say The UK’s housing secretary Robert Jenrick is on media duties this morning, and he has said that coronavirus cases are “clearly rising” and that the government is reviewing a range of data to make a decision on the further lifting of restrictions on 21 June. PA Media reports he told Sky News: “The prime minister is reviewing the data, and more data is coming in, which is very important. We created this five-week period between the stages of the road map and that has actually proved invaluable on this occasion, because it’s a finely balanced decision. “We need to see that data of cases, which are clearly rising, but the link to hospitalisations and ultimately to death. So the prime minister is reviewing that ahead of the decision point, which is going to be 14 June – at that point of course he will let everybody know what the ultimate decision is.” He was pressed particularly on the impact on wedding planning, and the current uncertainty over how many people will be able to attend ceremonies during July. The cap on 30 attendees was one of the restrictions the UK government roadmap touted being lifted “no earlier” than 21 June. Jenrick said: We’ve always said that the roadmap is subject to review of the data, and that is what is happening right now. So whether it’s weddings, or international travel, or any of these other important topics, you always have to wait until the judgment is made on the basis of the data. I wouldn’t make plans until you’ve heard from the PM, if that’s important to you, but weddings can go ahead right now but just with the maximum 30 guests. Mongolia is the latest country to begin holding an election where Covid restrictions are in place for voting, and where the handling of the pandemic is going to be a major factor in swaying the vote. The winner will become the sixth president he vast landlocked nation of 3 million people since the peaceful transition from communism to democracy in 1992. Incumbent Battulga Khaltmaa of the Democratic party is barred by the constitution from seeking a second six-year term. Voters are required to observe social distancing, and restrictions on public gatherings have severely curtailed campaign events, prompting candidates to shift much of their outreach to voters online. Mongolia’s already ailing economy has been thrown into crisis due to the pandemic, with 69,022 cases and 324 deaths reported and the number of new local infections hitting a daily record last week. That has forced the temporary closure of markets and other enterprises in the capital of Ulaanbaatar. Pandemic-related disruptions in demand for Mongolia’s chief exports such as coal and copper are also dragging on the economy. Doctors, pharmacists and workplaces in Australia can now incentivise people to receive the Covid-19 vaccine by offering rewards including cash, prizes and complementary and alternative medicines, in a move a professor of public health and expert on drugs regulation, Prof Ken Harvey, has described as “utter craziness”. Since Covid-19 vaccines became available in Australia from February, some doctors have expressed frustration that strict rules around the promotion and advertising of medicines enforced by drugs regulator the Therapeutic Goods Administration has meant they could not promote the vaccines as freely as they would have liked, including directly to patients during consults, or on social media. The regulations are important because they prevent drugs companies and health professionals from making exaggerated claims about medicines and medical devices, and stop drug companies from advertising prescription drugs directly to consumers including through television, radio and social media. But the regulations have also made vaccine promotion difficult during the pandemic. In response, the TGA amended the rules, though only for the promotion of Covid-19 vaccines. While health professionals, corporate entities and media outlets can now communicate information publicly about TGA-approved Covid-19 vaccines, this information must be consistent with current commonwealth health messaging. Any promotion must not reference brand names such as Pfizer or AstraZeneca or any active ingredients that might identify the vaccines. The rules do not allow any statements saying vaccines do not cause harm, or any false or misleading information. Read more of Melissa Davey’s report here: Covid vaccine incentives – Australian doctors now allowed to offer cash, prizes and alternative medicines Also worth noting, the UK has not been included in a mass update of international travel warnings from the US State Department mentioned earlier [see 6.46am]. PA Media notes that the department has changed its advice for dozens of nations, including France, Spain and Italy, from “Level 4: Do Not Travel” to “Level 3: Reconsider Travel”, according to its website. The UK has been designated Level 3 since May 10. The Level 3 advice allows travel for fully vaccinated citizens, with a warning they should “avoid travel due to serious risks to safety and security”. However, the UK is still subject to a presidential decree which prohibits non-US citizens who have been in the UK in the last 14 days from entering the country. The full list can be found on the state department website here: US state department travel advisories Overnight PA’s Joe Gammie has rounded-up some more response from the travel industry on the traffic-light system being used for international travel in England – and it is not a warm welcome for it. London-based World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) said the Government must scrap the system which has “wreaked havoc” among consumers and businesses in order to save hundreds of thousands of jobs. Portugal being moved from the green to amber caught many holidaymakers by surprise and left thousands of UK tourists scrambling to get home before new quarantine rules came into force on Tuesday morning. The WTTC said that moving to a more transparent and easier to understand system will restore consumer confidence and provide a “much-needed” boost to the travel and tourism sector. It warned that a further 218,000 jobs were at “serious risk” if international travel continued to be off limits for most of the summer, on top of the 307,000 jobs which were lost in the UK sector last year. WTTC acting CEO Virginia Messina said: “It’s time the Government abandoned the hugely damaging traffic lights system. Consumers, airlines and the wider travel sector were promised a watchlist and three weeks’ notice of any changes from green to amber, and not just four days. “It has been incredibly disruptive and costly for both travel and tourism businesses and consumers. It simply hasn’t worked. What’s needed now is a watertight government policy enabling those who’ve been fully jabbed to travel freely, and not have to self-isolate on their return. “Those who are not fully vaccinated should be able to travel with proof of a negative test, like what we are seeing in the EU. The travel sector needs this now if it is to survive this summer as domestic travel alone will not save the day.” It is already clear what one of the main topics of the UK’s morning media round is going to be: presenters trying to trip up ministers over Andrew Lloyd-Webber’s claim that he was going to reopen his theatres come-what-may and is willing to be arrested over it. The composer said he may have to sell his six West End venues if the government does not remove restrictions that have forced venues to run with reduced capacities. Lloyd Webber is preparing for a production of Cinderella, which is scheduled to open for previews on 25 June ahead of its world premiere in July. “We are going to open, come hell or high water,” Lord Lloyd-Webber told the Telegraph. Asked what he would do if the government postponed lifting lockdown, he said: “We will say: ‘come to the theatre and arrest us.”’ On Sky News, Kay Burley has already been repeatedly pressing housing minister Robert Jenrick on whether Lloyd-Webber should be arrested. For a government that indulged Dominic Cumming’s trip to Durham last year, it is always tricky for a minister to flat-out state that someone should just obey the rules. I’m not sure this is the most enlightening way to tease out current government thinking on whether there will be a delay to England’s planned 21 June reopening. It may well feel like a very long morning of interviews for Jenrick. Confidence in the EU’s ability to handle crises has taken a hit from Covid-19, a major survey shows, but dissatisfaction with national political systems is even higher and most people still support EU membership and want a stronger, more cooperative bloc. The report’s authors suggested the polling should be a wake-up call for Brussels, warning that while public support for the broader European project remained high in many countries, it was fragile and would not easily survive more disappointment. Europeans were “making a distinction between the need for cooperation and solidarity at a European level, and their confidence in the EU to deliver”, they said, and were unhappy the bloc had “missed an opportunity to prove its worth”. The polling also suggested Brexit had changed Europeans’ views of the UK, with the prevailing view now seeing Britain – like the US – as a “necessary partner” to be “strategically cooperated with” rather than an ally, and one in four Germans and one in five French and Spanish respondents considering it as a rival or adversary. The report, published by the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR) on Wednesday, suggested the bloc’s poor early response to the pandemic and slow initial vaccine rollout had dealt a heavy blow to confidence in its capabilities. Read Jon Henley’s full report here: Europeans’ confidence in EU hit by coronavirus response Chinese authorities in Guangdong have taken extraordinary measures to make sure students have been able to sit the crucial gaokao college entrance exams amid an outbreak in the city of Guangzhou. From AFP: The local government has dispatched hundreds of taxis and buses to ferry students from neighbourhoods affected by the outbreak to exam venues, with state broadcaster CCTV showing footage of drivers in hazmat suits spraying down their cars. Students were split into different rooms based on their level of Covid-19 risk, with contacts of confirmed cases taking the tests in smaller groups. But infected students with mild symptoms had to take the tough exams solo in brightly lit isolation rooms in the hospital or special locations. CCTV footage showed one student sitting at a lone desk and scratching his head as he read the exam paper, a bottle of hand sanitizer on the desk and officials monitoring him on a TV screen. Other state footage showed masked examiners in protective clothing removing completed exam papers from infected students and hanging them up on a clothes-drying rack to be sprayed down with disinfectant. Provincial officials inspected testing sites in Guangzhou late last week and urged examiners to make sure “students feel comfortable, parents are at ease and society is reassured,” the local government said. Last year’s gaokao exams were delayed as schools hesitated to resume mass activities due to the coronavirus, which first emerged in the country in late 2019. Life in China has since returned almost to normal, with authorities responding to sporadic outbreaks with aggressive testing and localised quarantines. Guangzhou authorities shut down cinemas and karaoke bars across the city on Tuesday, and have locked down neighbourhoods and ordered travellers leaving the city to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test. China reported eight locally transmitted Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, all of which were detected in Guangdong province. Reuters: The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has eased travel recommendations for more than 110 countries and territories, including Japan just ahead of the Olympics. The Biden administration is forming expert working groups with Canada, Mexico, the European Union and Britain to determine how best to safely restart travel after 15 months of pandemic restrictions, a White House official said on Tuesday. The CDC’s new ratings include 61 nations that were lowered from its highest “level 4” rating that discouraged all travel to recommending travel for fully vaccinated individuals, the agency confirmed on Tuesday. An additional 50 countries and territories have been lowered to “level 2” or “level 1,” a CDC spokeswoman said. Countries ranked lowest for Covid-19 risks now include Singapore, Israel, South Korea, Iceland, Belize and Albania. Among those now listed at “level 3,” are France, Ecuador, the Philippines, South Africa, Canada, Mexico, Russia, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, Honduras, Hungary and Italy. A US pharmacist has been jailed for three years after pleading guilty to trying to spoil hundreds of doses of the Moderna vaccine because he was skeptical about them. The US justice department said on Tuesday the 46-year-old man had also been ordered to pay $83,800 in compensation to the hospital at which he worked. According to a statement from the Wisconsin eastern district’s US Attorney’s office, he pleaded guilty to two counts of attempting to tamper with consumer products with reckless disregard for the risk that another person would be placed in danger of death or bodily injury. According to justice department, in December 2020 the man deliberately removed a box of vaccine vials from a hospital refrigeration unit on two successive night shift. Moderna’s vaccine has to be stored and shipped frozen but can be stored for 30 days in standard-temperature refrigerators. The statement said the man was generally skeptical of vaccines, and the Moderna vaccine specifically. It said he had shared his beliefs with co-workers for at least the past two years. Intensive care beds for Covid patients in Malaysia have reached full capacity, according to the country’s health director general, who said the country’s pandemic remained at a critical level. Malaysia entered a near total lockdown on 1 June, after daily cases rose to more than 9,000 last month. The increase in cases has been blamed on the more infectious variants of the virus, as well as gatherings held ahead of Eid al-Fitr. Malaysia’s health director general, Noor Hisham Abdullah, said hospitals were facing a rise in severe cases of Covid, especially among older and clinically vulnerable people, who needed oxygen and respiratory assistance. “These patients need a long recovery period to heal, due to serious complications from Covid-19,” he said. The pressure placed on intensive care units, which are at 100% capacity, was very worrying, Noor Hisham said, adding some patients who needed critical care could not be placed in an ICU bed. While new infections have fallen slightly over the past two weeks, there were still 82,797 active cases under treatment and observation as of 8 June. Malaysia managed to contain the virus for much of 2020, and had recorded fewer than 500 fatalities by January. The country’s death toll has since risen to 3,536, while 627,652 cases have been recorded. Hospital morgues have been forced to use containers to cope with the rise in fatalities. Malaysia imposed a national lockdown on 1 June, shutting schools and shopping malls. Only two people from each household are allowed to go out to buy essentials or seek medical treatment within 10km of their home. The manufacturing sector, however, has been allowed to continue operating at a reduced capacity. Malaysia began its vaccination campaign in February, and 7.7% of the population has since received at least one dose Hello and welcome to the continuing coverage of the global pandemic. Here are some of the major developments in the last day. Guangzhou city in China has ordered the closures of cinemas, theatres, nightclubs and other indoor entertainment venues amid an outbreak. The US and the European Union are expected to support a renewed push into investigating the origins of Covid-19 after conflicting assessments about where the outbreak started, according to Bloomberg News. Residents of Melbourne in Australia will come out a tough lockdown on Thursday night, but will still be subject to restrictions including 25km travel limits Washington is also forming working parties with Brussels, Canada, and Mexico to determine how best to safely restart international travel. It came as the World Travel and Tourism Council said the UK government had to scrap its traffic light system for travel because it had “wreaked havoc”. Portugal will allow vaccinated US tourists into the country, Reuters reports. “We are in a position to approve the opening of non-essential travel and flights to people from the US to Portugal as long as they have a vaccination certificate,” economy minister Pedro Siza Vieira, cited by Portuguese radio Renascenca, said. Vaccine passports will be used for the first time at UK sporting events for England’s Euro 2020 group games at Wembley stadium, with those not fully vaccinated able to show proof of a negative lateral flow test taken within the previous 48 hours. World Bank president David Malpass said the institution does not support waiving intellectual property rights for Covid-19 vaccines at the World Trade Organization, claiming it is out of concern that it would hamper innovation in the pharmaceuticals sector. South Africa’s president Cyril Ramaphosa placed the country’s health minister on “special leave” over alleged links to a corruption scandal involving coronavirus communications funding. Pfizer is to begin testing its Covid-19 vaccine on a larger cohort of thousands of children under 12 years old in the US, Finland, Poland and Spain after selecting a lower dose of the shot in an earlier stage of the trial. A top White House official has urged state governors to work with the US Food and Drug Administration to extend the shelf life of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s Covid vaccine as millions of unused doses nationwide near expiration. Many thousands of vaccine doses have been destroyed in African countries after exceeding their expiry dates amid a reluctance to be inoculated and a lack of medical infrastructure, while some jabs were donated relatively late in their shelf life. Music fans flocked to the first unrestricted European festival since the pandemic began over the weekend at an event in Albania that had 10,000 attendees across four days, with everyone showing proof of a recent negative test. Washington state is to give adults a free cannabis spliff after they receive a Covid jab in an attempt to accelerate vaccination uptake through a promotion coined “Joints for Jabs” by the state’s liquor and cannabis board.","charCount":"34221","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a> (now) and <a href=\"profile/helen-davidson\">Helen Davidson</a> (earlier)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/live/2021/jun/09/brexit-northern-ireland-eu-trade-coronavirus-covid-uk-live-latest-news-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-09T09:37:27Z","webTitle":"Senior Tory accuses No 10 of falsely claiming it did not realise damage of Brexit in Northern Ireland – politics live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2021/jun/09/brexit-northern-ireland-eu-trade-coronavirus-covid-uk-live-latest-news-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/live/2021/jun/09/brexit-northern-ireland-eu-trade-coronavirus-covid-uk-live-latest-news-updates","fields":{"headline":"Senior Tory accuses No 10 of falsely claiming it did not realise damage of Brexit in Northern Ireland – politics live","standfirst":"<p>Latest updates: Lord Frost holds talks with Maroš Šefčovič <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2021/jun/09/brexit-northern-ireland-eu-trade-coronavirus-covid-uk-live-latest-news-updates?page=with:block-60c06f4c8f0837b8708e1e74#block-60c06f4c8f0837b8708e1e74\">in attempt to resolve the dispute</a> about post-Brexit rules</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/08/tensions-rise-over-eu-trade-row-with-uk-over-sausage-sales\">Trade war threats will not wash with voters, Frost tells EU</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/jun/09/boris-johnson-urged-to-axe-deadline-for-eu-citizens-to-apply-to-stay-in-uk\">PM urged to axe deadline for EU citizens to apply to stay in UK</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/jun/09/australian-government-prepared-to-walk-away-from-uk-free-trade-deal-over-agricultural-access\">Australia prepared to walk away from UK free trade deal</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/09/europeans-confidence-in-eu-hit-by-coronavirus-response\">Europeans’ confidence in EU hit by coronavirus response</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus – latest global updates</a></li></ul>","trailText":"Latest updates: Lord Frost holds talks with Maroš Šefčovič in attempt to resolve the dispute about the post-Brexit rules","byline":"Andrew Sparrow","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"28420ff5c78e282751189dc361e6fcdbb4891fa7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/28420ff5c78e282751189dc361e6fcdbb4891fa7/201_739_7071_4245/1000.jpg\" alt=\"European Commission vice-president Maroš Šefčovič arrives at St Pancras in London for post-Brexit talks.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">European Commission vice-president Maroš Šefčovič arrives at St Pancras in London for post-Brexit talks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tolga Akmen/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<div id=\"block-60c08a878f0837b8708e1fda\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-09T09:37:27.951Z\">10.37am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Boris Johnson</strong> has thanked police officers for their work during the pandemic in a surprise video address to the Police Federation conference this morning.

Delivering what he said was a “huge thank you”, he said: You’ve encouraged people to stick to the rules the same time as you’ve been fighting crime and you’ve each risen to an enormous challenge. Just as I could never have imagined being forced, as prime minister, to close pubs and bars and restaurants or tell people how many households could get together, I bet that policing restrictions in that way was not something you ever dreamt you would be doing. But you did it because you knew it was how we were going to protect the NHS and save lives. Johnson also said that the government had recruited 8,771 new officers and that it was 44% of the way towards the target of 20,000 extra officers by 2023. Arlene Foster, the outgoing DUP first minister of Northern Ireland, does not seem to agree with Gavin Barwell’s analysis of who is to blame for the problems with the Northern Ireland protocol. (See 8.48am.) She has posted this response to a tweet from the former Ukip MEP Patrick O’Flynn. More than 80% of adults in England and Wales would test positive for Covid antibodies, according to figures released by the Office for National Statistics this morning. The figures are lower for Northern Ireland (79.9%) and for Scotland (72.6%). Having antibodies can protect people from further infection. People acquire antibodies either through vaccination, or from being infected in the past. But antibody levels do not correspond to the total number of people vaccinated and infected in the past because over time antibody levels reduce to the point where they are no longer detected in tests. Here are the figures for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. They cover the week beginning Monday 17 May, and they are based on the results of a survey that involves tens of thousands of people being tested at random. And these charts compare the proportion of adults testing positive for antibodies (the dark blue line) with the proportion who have had one dose of vaccine (the green line) and the proportion fully vaccinated (the light green line). Lord Frost and his EU counterpart Maroš Šefčovič, vice-president of the European Commission, have started their talks at Admiralty House in London. Although it essentially one event, technically there are two meetings taking place: a meeting of the withdrawal agreement joint committee meeting (the body set up to oversee the implementation of the withdrawal agreement, including the Northern Ireland protocol); and a meeting of the partnership council (the body set up to oversee the implementation of the UK-EU trade deal, the trade and cooperation agreement). Frost and Šefčovič jointly chair both bodies. Here is the agenda (pdf) for the withdrawal agreement joint committee meeting. And here is the agenda (pdf) for the partnership council meeting. In a statement issued last night, ahead of his meeting this morning with Maroš Šefčovič, Lord Frost, the Brexit minister, urged the EU to adopt “pragmatism” and “common sense solutions” to resolve the problems in Northern Ireland. He said: I hope this will be a productive forum where we can address shared challenges by working together in the spirit of mutual trust and cooperation.

Posted on Wednesday to drum up support for New South Wales in its upcoming clash with Queensland in the State of Origin rugby, the premier’s photo was instead widely mocked for its bizarre composition and strange elements. In the image, Berejiklian can be seen standing alone in a large room with the blinds drawn, watching a small, blurred television that is largely out of frame. With her back to the camera, the Liberal leader is holding an unopened can of sugar-free Coke. She’s wearing a Blues beanie and scarf. Within minutes of it being posted on Twitter and Facebook, the premier’s photographer and social media team were immediately criticised for having created the unsettling image. The photo was published at 4pm on Wednesday – more than four hours before the game was due to start. The premier’s televisual faux pas spawned hundreds of memes and drew comparisons to a surprisingly long list of other politicians who viewed their televisions from strange angles. In 2017, the former prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, made headlines for watching the outcome of the marriage equality postal survey on an extremely low TV, mounted inside a cabinet on the floor, while he remained standing. Later that night, he somehow found another way to observe a television incorrectly, when he watched the Socceroos beat Honduras in a World Cup qualifier from a very low angle, with the TV too high. The current prime minister, Scott Morrison, has also been snapped watching rugby on a small TV somehow mounted in the corner of a room (while pointing at it) and watching the finale of Game of Thrones on a too-large bank of TVs. Australia’s high commissioner to the UK, and former attorney general, George Brandis, watched the last federal budget on a tiny laptop while seated too far away. But on Wednesday, the fact that Berejiklian was pictured entirely from behind, with none of her face visible, also raised questions as to whether it was actually the premier in the photo. A rapidly-made template also enabled many to make their own memes of the premier watching other famous historical events.","charCount":"2290","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/naaman-zhou\">Naaman Zhou</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2021/jun/08/tensions-rise-over-eu-trade-row-with-uk-over-sausage-sales","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-09T09:25:20Z","webTitle":"Trade war threats will not wash with voters, Frost tells EU as row deepens","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/08/tensions-rise-over-eu-trade-row-with-uk-over-sausage-sales","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/jun/08/tensions-rise-over-eu-trade-row-with-uk-over-sausage-sales","fields":{"headline":"Trade war threats will not wash with voters, Frost tells EU as row deepens","standfirst":"<p>UK considering unilaterally extending grace periods under Northern Ireland protocol </p>","trailText":"UK considering unilaterally extending grace periods under Northern Ireland protocol","byline":"Lisa O'Carroll and Aubrey Allegretti","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9fe75abe5b866e81dcfa5e2df9d7d929bbaad9a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9fe75abe5b866e81dcfa5e2df9d7d929bbaad9a2/0_511_7662_4599/1000.jpg\" alt=\"European Commission vice-president Maros Sefčovič, centre, arrives in London to lead the negotiations from Brussels’ side\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The European Commission vice-president Maros Sefčovič, centre, arrives in London to lead the negotiations from the Brussels’ side.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tolga Akmen/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>The row between the UK and the EU over checks on sausages and other chilled foods sent from Britain to Northern Ireland has deepened, with the Brexit minister telling Brussels that trade war threats will not wash with voters.</p> <p>As a major meeting on Wednesday approached, David Frost said: “Further threats of legal action and trade retaliation from the EU won’t make life any easier for the shopper in Strabane who can’t buy their favourite product.

As a major meeting on Wednesday approached, David Frost said: “Further threats of legal action and trade retaliation from the EU won’t make life any easier for the shopper in Strabane who can’t buy their favourite product. Nor will it benefit the small business in Ballymena struggling to source produce from their supplier in Birmingham.” His comments underline the growing gulf between Brussels and London over Northern Ireland with many expecting the US president, Joe Biden, to press Boris Johnson on the issue when they meet in Cornwall at the G7 summit later on Wednesday. A report in Politico that some EU officials and diplomats had floated a back-up plan involving checks on all goods leaving the island of Ireland is said to be causing extreme anxiety in Dublin. Such a plan has echoes of the row in January when Brussels threatened to invoke article 16 of the protocol in a row over vaccines without consulting Dublin first. Lord Frost’s comments came hours after the former French European affairs minister Nathalie Loiseau, now an MEP, warned that the EU had the power to impose quotas on British exports if it continued to make unilateral decisions on how the Northern Ireland protocol was implemented. Frost was due to dine with his European Commission counterpart, Maroš Šefčovič, in London on Tuesday night before two key meetings between the UK and the EU about Northern Ireland and other Brexit issues at 8am on Wednesday. The tenor of Frost’s statement underlines the fading hope for any breakthrough agreement on the checks, which are opposed by unionists and led to violence in Northern Ireland at Easter. The UK government is reportedly considering unilaterally extending the grace periods under the protocol that give businesses in Northern Ireland time to adapt to new rules – including for the import of chilled meats such as sausages, chicken nuggets and mince from Great Britain. The grace periods are due to expire at the end of June but, according to the Telegraph, Johnson is contemplating extending them in the face of a lack of progress towards a new agreement on about 30 issues relating to checks on animals, goods and medicines. “When I meet Maroš Šefčovič later today my message will be clear: time is short and practical solutions are needed now to make the protocol work,” said Frost. Šefčovič said on Tuesday that the EU would act “swiftly, firmly and resolutely to ensure that the UK abides by its international law obligations” if the UK decided to delay checks on chilled meats on 30 June. Loiseau told BBC Radio 4 that if the UK continues to breach the protocol, then tariffs and quotas designed to regulate the import of goods into the EU by upping the price and putting a cap on numbers could be necessary. “We don’t want to reach that,” she said. “But we are warning: you signed an agreement, you have to implement it, otherwise there are measures we can take that will protect our single market … The international reputation of the UK is at stake.” George Eustice, the environment secretary, described the threat of an “outright ban” on chicken nuggets and sausages being sent from Great Britain to Northern Ireland as “bonkers”. One EU source said Loiseau’s comments regarding the threat of trade quotas being imposed on the EU reflected the fact that the Brexit relationship had been “weaponised”, with a range of remedies and penalties at the EU’s disposal that were not there in January when the withdrawal agreement involving the Northern Ireland protocol and citizens’ rights was signed and ratified by both sides. “We now have the principle of good faith in a legal agreement and if there are any problems in the trade and cooperation agreement we have legal instruments at our disposal including trade sanctions,” the source said. Northern Irish businesses are calling on both sides to stop a Brexit “blame game” and deliver urgent solutions to end growing tensions over the checks on food and goods crossing the Irish Sea into the region. The protocol has been hugely controversial in Northern Ireland, contributing to violence over Easter and fissures in the Democratic Unionist party, which is officially campaigning to have it scrapped.","charCount":"4423","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/lisaocarroll\">Lisa O'Carroll</a> and <a href=\"profile/aubrey-allegretti\">Aubrey Allegretti</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2021/jun/09/football-school-extract-how-spain-won-three-tournaments-in-a-row","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-09T09:00:46Z","webTitle":"Football School extract: how Spain won three tournaments in a row","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/jun/09/football-school-extract-how-spain-won-three-tournaments-in-a-row","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2021/jun/09/football-school-extract-how-spain-won-three-tournaments-in-a-row","fields":{"headline":"Football School extract: how Spain won three tournaments in a row","standfirst":"<p>As we launch our third Young Sportswriter of the Year competition, here is an extract to inspire the budding journalists</p>","trailText":"As we launch our third Young Sportswriter of the Year competition, here is an extract to inspire the budding journalists","byline":"Ben Lyttleton and Alex Bellos","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f766dfc3d1e9982282c7fcffe526bb070fe4f9af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f766dfc3d1e9982282c7fcffe526bb070fe4f9af/1632_253_1412_848/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Spain won their three tournaments between 2008 and 2012 in very different ways. \" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spain won their three tournaments between 2008 and 2012 in very different ways. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: © 2021 Spike Gerrell</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Spain were the first national team to win three international tournaments in a row.

As with much of the rest of his work, and especially his earlier film Le Noire De… (1966), it is about colonialism and Africa’s relationship with France, though a 21st-century audience might specifically read it as a parable of globalisation, and what happens when a poor country exiles its cheap labour to wealthy countries in the expectation of money getting sent home.</p> <p>Makhourédia Guèye plays Ibrahim: a lazy, conceited man with two wives, Méty (Ynousse N’Diaye) and Aram (Isseu Niang) and seven children in a village outside Dakar, Senegal. The first time we see him, Ibrahim is being shaved by a barber, and getting his gruesome nose hairs trimmed. Later he eats greedily to the point of indigestion and settles down for a nap instead of going to the mosque for prayers; he is always burping, coughing, grimacing, and upon being massaged, appears horribly to break wind.</p> <p>Then his world is turned upside down by the postman, who announces that Ibrahim has received a letter and a money order for 25,000 francs from his nephew who is living and working in Paris. The interpreter at the post office who later reads this letter out to him reveals that this industrious young man is asking Ibrahim to save 20,000 for him when he returns; give 3,000 to his mother and keep 2,000 for himself.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3LJ5RJ8wOg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/L3LJ5RJ8wOg?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>But Ibrahim can’t cash the money without an ID card and needs to procure all sorts of documents to get one, causing a fatal delay; the exciting news of his sudden riches has brought crooks and predators out of the woodwork – encouraged, of course, by Ibrahim and his wives themselves who are using the news of this money order to buy things on credit. There are also salesmen (bizarrely, a bra salesman) and beggars both honest and dishonest, whom Ibrahim has to send away, advised by his wives: “If you try to help nine poor people, you will soon become the tenth.” Soon his sister (Thérèse Bas) appears – to whom greedy Ibrahim has not given a moment’s thought since getting the money order – demanding to know where her 3,000 francs is. And with a terrible inevitability, Ibrahim is tricked out of the cash.<br><br>The film’s biggest formal coup is the scene in which Sembène gives us a little montage of the nephew’s life in Paris, under his voiceover, in which he earnestly says that he will not “rebel” or “go astray”, but just work hard, because there is no work in Senegal.

As with much of the rest of his work, and especially his earlier film Le Noire De… (1966), it is about colonialism and Africa’s relationship with France, though a 21st-century audience might specifically read it as a parable of globalisation, and what happens when a poor country exiles its cheap labour to wealthy countries in the expectation of money getting sent home. Makhourédia Guèye plays Ibrahim: a lazy, conceited man with two wives, Méty (Ynousse N’Diaye) and Aram (Isseu Niang) and seven children in a village outside Dakar, Senegal. The first time we see him, Ibrahim is being shaved by a barber, and getting his gruesome nose hairs trimmed. Later he eats greedily to the point of indigestion and settles down for a nap instead of going to the mosque for prayers; he is always burping, coughing, grimacing, and upon being massaged, appears horribly to break wind. Then his world is turned upside down by the postman, who announces that Ibrahim has received a letter and a money order for 25,000 francs from his nephew who is living and working in Paris. The interpreter at the post office who later reads this letter out to him reveals that this industrious young man is asking Ibrahim to save 20,000 for him when he returns; give 3,000 to his mother and keep 2,000 for himself. But Ibrahim can’t cash the money without an ID card and needs to procure all sorts of documents to get one, causing a fatal delay; the exciting news of his sudden riches has brought crooks and predators out of the woodwork – encouraged, of course, by Ibrahim and his wives themselves who are using the news of this money order to buy things on credit. There are also salesmen (bizarrely, a bra salesman) and beggars both honest and dishonest, whom Ibrahim has to send away, advised by his wives: “If you try to help nine poor people, you will soon become the tenth.” Soon his sister (Thérèse Bas) appears – to whom greedy Ibrahim has not given a moment’s thought since getting the money order – demanding to know where her 3,000 francs is. And with a terrible inevitability, Ibrahim is tricked out of the cash. The film’s biggest formal coup is the scene in which Sembène gives us a little montage of the nephew’s life in Paris, under his voiceover, in which he earnestly says that he will not “rebel” or “go astray”, but just work hard, because there is no work in Senegal. It is as if Senegal has exported its youth, its idealism and its optimism – and in return imports cash that causes only bitterness. It is an alienated society. The men are cynics or crooks, or they are simply bewildered and weak like Ibrahim, or simply overcome with a kind of lassitude and ennui: there is a good deal of listless dozing in the sun. Mandabi features an excellent performance from Guèye, who is innocent and culpable all at once. This is gentle, walking-pace cinema that leads us by the hand from vignette to vignette, from scene to scene, presented to us with ingenuous simplicity and calm. • Mandabi is released on 11 June in cinemas.","charCount":"3221","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"true","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/peterbradshaw\">Peter Bradshaw</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2021/jun/09/i-just-want-what-everyone-else-has-what-homeless-people-told-jennifer-kavanagh-about-their-lives","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-09T09:00:45Z","webTitle":"‘I just want what everyone else has’: what homeless people told Jennifer Kavanagh about their lives","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/jun/09/i-just-want-what-everyone-else-has-what-homeless-people-told-jennifer-kavanagh-about-their-lives","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2021/jun/09/i-just-want-what-everyone-else-has-what-homeless-people-told-jennifer-kavanagh-about-their-lives","fields":{"headline":"‘I just want what everyone else has’: what homeless people told Jennifer Kavanagh about their lives","standfirst":"<p>For 15 months the author walked around London, telling the story of its streets, speaking to living statues, sex workers, drug dealers, security guards, cleaners and those who sleep out every night<br></p>","trailText":"For 15 months the author walked around London, telling the story of its streets, speaking to living statues, sex workers, drug dealers, security guards, cleaners and those who sleep out every night<br>","byline":"John Harris","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a5e9c5dba464d6ae3f48ddb9ee8c11c43d325bf2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5e9c5dba464d6ae3f48ddb9ee8c11c43d325bf2/0_384_5754_3452/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jennifer Kavanagh: ‘How can we just take it for granted that we have people on the streets?

I have not come to interview him, but his experience is so relevant to what I will be talking about for the next two hours that I feel duty-bound to ask him about his life, and how things have been in the past 15 months.</p> <p>When he is not in the centre of the city, he tells me, he lives in a hostel for homeless people near Canary Wharf, five or six miles to the east. “Lockdown was hard,” he says, “’cos I couldn’t sell the magazine, and I needed to pay rent to the hostel. And the isolation was really difficult: a little room, and I had to pretty much stay in there, and only go out for, like, an hour a day. I went for weeks on end not speaking to anyone.” Does he have family? “No, no. Not in London. My parents are dead; my brother and sister are abroad. One in Canada, one in Australia. So it’s been isolating, you know?”</p> <p>He gestures at the book I have been leafing through, and the woman sitting next to me, who wrote it. “Let me take you by the hand,” he half-sings, “and to the promised land.” He breaks into a laugh, before saying goodbye and disappearing into a branch of Caffè Nero.</p> <p>Let Me Take You By the Hand is the latest book by Jennifer Kavanagh, a writer, teacher and social activist with a long personal history of immersion in London’s street life, and of work with the people who fall through the city’s cracks. The title is taken from the folk singer Ralph McTell’s social-realist classic, Streets of London; the book’s key inspiration is the Victorian journalist Henry Mayhew’s exhaustive work London Labour and the London Poor, published in 1861 and full of portraits of life at the capital’s social edges. George – whom Kavanagh has come to know well – is one of her book’s huge cast, along with about 200 others, from street performers who work as living statues, through sex workers and drug dealers, to people sleeping on the streets, and others suffering the cruelties of the immigration system.</p> <p>Many are victims of violence and abuse. Some have gone from earning six-figure salaries to sleeping rough, thanks to addiction and relationship breakdown. Others have lost children, something highlighted by an ex-Coldstream Guardsman called Stephen, whom she encounters outside All Souls church, near BBC Broadcasting House. “He said it very plainly: ‘The death of a child is something you just can’t cope with.’ There are two or three people in the book who lost children.” She sighs. “Just mind-blowing.”</p> <p>Some of her other stories of homelessness are just as centred on loss, but are more complex. “There’s a man in the book called Darren, who I saw the other day; it was sad to see him back, selling the Big Issue. He’s had five children and given them all up for adoption. He’s in an awful state. I first met him years and years ago. He said to me that his partner was expecting a baby, and I collected money from my meeting to buy baby clothes for him. Then, about a year later, I said: ‘How’s the baby? And he said: ‘Oh, we had to give her up.’”</p> <p>She finds a quote from him in the book, which I read aloud: “My mum, she’s an alcoholic, so she just couldn’t handle looking after me and my sisters. Don’t do family. Brought myself up, can be done. I got eight sisters but I don’t see none of them, they all got adopted. They got their lives. Yeah, I’ve got five children. Same partner, together 10 years … No, not together now … It’s better. Prefer being on my own. All the children in care.” Darren, she reminds me, was a looked-after child himself.</p> <p>Kavanagh is 74 and lives alone, in a mansion-block flat next to a pub two minutes’ walk from where we meet. Born and raised in London, she is a gentle, empathic presence, prone to careful pauses for thought, and answers full of nuances. Today, she is dressed in the functional clothes – solid trainers, an insulated purple jacket – of someone used to walking around the city. That reflects how she gathered the book’s raw material: hiking through the capital “nearly every day” for 15 months, either with the intention of getting into a specific story, or talking to whoever she happened to find.</p> <p>Her fieldwork – which was helped by two other interviewers, who contributed additional material – ended just as the pandemic began, but Covid has only highlighted the deep social issues she portrays. “I wanted to give people evidence of all the inequalities – which until the last year, most people haven’t been very aware of,” she says. “I wanted to reveal the people behind the uniforms – people who are mostly invisible to passersby, who <em>do everything</em> – security guards, people polishing the brass outside the pub, street cleaners.</p> <p>“And homelessness was always at the centre of it, because I just feel so passionately about it. I used to get so angry, and think: ‘How can we just take it for granted that we have people on the streets?’ We didn’t have when I was growing up. I can’t stand it. To me, it’s just unbearable.”</p> <p>Most people, I suggest, are at least partly desensitised to it. We all know the awful reality of homelessness, but most of the time, when we see someone sleeping rough, we don’t feel the kind of moral pang we ought to.</p> <p>“I know. That’s exactly what concerns me.” Is she different? Does she feel it? “Not always. Mostly.”</p> <p>Does she give homeless people money? “I usually buy people something to eat. And I’m uneasy with that predicament. I think we all are. I occasionally give people money. I don’t like having a moral stance about: ‘Oh, they’ll just spend it on drugs.’”</p> <p>It implies passing judgment, doesn’t it? And if you haven’t ever slept rough, maybe you’re not entitled to do that. “Exactly. Exactly. I remember one woman running after me in the street, asking me for money. I gave her a tenner. And the astonishment and delight … Sometimes generosity is a huge motivator. People maybe feel that if someone is prepared to give them ten pounds, they themselves might be worth something.”</p> <p>Until 1997, Kavanagh owned and ran a thriving literary agency, with 80 or so clients, including many successful novelists and a handful of Booker prize nominees. Then everything changed. “I’d wanted to give up agenting for some time,” she says. “Anyone in publishing will tell you the same – it had become more and more difficult to get real novelists and storytellers published in an ongoing way. It all just became celebrity, celebrity, celebrity. So I’d had enough.”</p> <p>There had also been upheavals in her personal and family life. “The breakup of my marriage in the late 80s. The breakup of the next relationship. My daughter getting an illness.” And eventually, she says, “in spiritual terms, I was cracked open, and able to access another dimension”. She sold the agency and used the proceeds to fund a long period of work and activism focused on some of our most ingrained social problems, spread over the next 12 years.</p> <p>What pushed her decisively in this direction was finding Quakerism, the non-hierarchical, open offshoot of Christianity that often emphasises being active in society. “I was finding myself in tears every time I went into a church – for a christening, or to look at the architecture. I thought: ‘What on earth’s going on here?’ And I really had no choice but to pursue it, so I went to various churches. I found out that wasn’t for me: ‘Sit down, now stand up’, and all that. But I remembered seeing the sign outside a Quaker meeting house, and I walked in, and I found peace. I wasn’t ready to talk to anyone about it, but I started reading about it, and I was absolutely gobsmacked. I thought: ‘I didn’t know religion could be like this.’”</p> <p>Like what? “Well, it wasn’t why I first went there, but it helped me recover my youthful idealism. I think most people would like to make a difference, but they don’t know how to. And when I arrived at Quakers, I found people who were doing exactly that – locally and collectively. So I jumped in with both feet.”</p> <p>One of the most important aspects of her new life was the three years she spent in charge of a Quaker-run community centre in the East End, where she oversaw mother-and-toddler groups, a regular gathering of women from a diverse cross-section of the local community, programmes that brought food to people suffering loneliness and isolation, and a trailblazing programme of so-called micro-credit, whereby people with ideas that might benefit the local community could access small loans – something she eventually took to such countries as Madagascar, Ghana and South Africa. She worked in prisons, studying the links between incarceration, education and homelessness.</p> <p>She also started the Open Wing Trust, which helps people who want to make the drastic kind of life change she did. “I could afford to do it,” she says. “I had a younger friend who did a similar thing, but had to borrow the money. I thought it would be really good to facilitate similar things for other people, some of whom have been prisoners. One guy wanted to become a music therapist, and we bought him his first keyboard. There was a former gang member who worked to stop people being in gangs, so we helped him get started.”</p> <p>When I write about community activism, I tell her, I’m always struck by how many of the people making a difference are women over 50.</p> <p>“That’s interesting,” she says. And does it sound familiar? “Well, it’s partly to do with who has the time and inclination. But I certainly think that [the psychoanalyst] Jung had it right when he talked about the second half of life. That’s when a lot of people realise what their life should be about.”</p> <p>In her early days of social activism, one particular experience changed her for good. “I was told to coordinate the soup runs they [the Quakers] were doing. That was the real epiphany for me. I couldn’t believe the extent of it, or the conditions people were living in.”</p> <p>She was also struck by the kindness of people who, on the face of it, could not afford it. “When I was first doing the soup runs, there was one really cold January night – and there was a woman, probably in her 50s, in a really skimpy cotton dress. She asked us for a blanket. We’d run out. And there was a guy further down the Strand who said: “She can have mine.’ I said: ‘What will you do?’ And he said: ‘She needs it more than me, and what’s life if you can’t give a little love?’ And I thought: How many of us could do that? I learned hugely. It was extraordinary.”</p> <p>After more than a year of the pandemic, how has it affected people living the kind of lives she has written about? “No one’s really doing anything about destitution,” she says. She then mentions the government’s so-called Everyone In initiative, which found shelter for people living on the streets during <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jan/10/first-lockdown-england-homelessness-everyone-in-streets\">the pandemic’s first couple of months</a>, but was not repeated. And even that scheme, she says, could be cold and inhumane. Once again she mentions Darren. “When I saw him the other day, he said: ‘They offered me a place in a hotel, but I would have to put my dog in kennels.’ I just thought: ‘Bloody hell – how can you do that? How can you not see how precious his dog is to him?’ I think that lack of sensitivity and understanding is still there.”</p> <p>Once we have finished the interview, Kavanagh walks me to Fitzroy Place, an office and residential development a stone’s throw from Oxford Street, completed in 2015. Its towering buildings are surrounded by the calm silence of wealth; a two-bedroom flat here sells for about £2.5m. She points out a patch of pavement nudging one of its outer edges, where she met a homeless woman called Carrie, who was 36 and said she had been homeless for 21 years, having experienced domestic violence and time in the care system. She was living in a tent.</p> <p>“That really upset me, because she was only about a street away from where I live, and she invited me in. That was a really, really moving thing, to sit in that tent. But I was free to get up and go away, back to my comfortable place.”</p> <p>One thing Carrie said stuck in her head. When she repeats it to me, the words sound almost like a prayer. They also capture the glaring inequality that defines both London and almost everything she portrays in her book: “I just want what everyone else has.”</p> <p><em>Let Me Take You By the Hand by Jennifer Kavanagh is published by Little, Brown.

She points out a patch of pavement nudging one of its outer edges, where she met a homeless woman called Carrie, who was 36 and said she had been homeless for 21 years, having experienced domestic violence and time in the care system. She was living in a tent. “That really upset me, because she was only about a street away from where I live, and she invited me in. That was a really, really moving thing, to sit in that tent. But I was free to get up and go away, back to my comfortable place.” One thing Carrie said stuck in her head. When she repeats it to me, the words sound almost like a prayer. They also capture the glaring inequality that defines both London and almost everything she portrays in her book: “I just want what everyone else has.” Let Me Take You By the Hand by Jennifer Kavanagh is published by Little, Brown.

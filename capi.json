The West Australian newspaper reported the alleged incident took place in 2020 after the woman, aged in her 20s, was followed back to her accommodation from the “wet mess” at Mulla Mulla village, the mining camp attached to the South Flank development. A “wet mess” is a dining area where alcohol can be consumed. The WA police minister, Paul Papalia, said he did not know of the “disturbing report” until approached by the newspaper, but police were investigating. “I understand Sex Assault Squad detectives are investigating the matter,” he said in a statement. “Women have the right to be safe at work and home. I encourage any victim of sexual assault to come forward to police so they can be supported and the matter investigated.” BHP would not comment on the specific allegations but said it had a zero tolerance approach to sexual harassment and assault. About 40% of employees at South Flank are women. “Sexual assault or harassment is unacceptable at BHP, full stop,” a BHP spokesperson said. “We are absolutely clear on this, and all employees, contractors and those that come to our sites are made aware of their obligation to support a safe and respectful workplace. “Any allegation of sexual assault or harassment is investigated by an independent central investigations team, and we encourage people to report any incidents that occur to authorities. If substantiated, disciplinary action is taken. Central to our response is to support the impacted person or people including through any investigation, outcomes, reporting and return to work.” The mining company said it viewed sexual harassment and assault as a “fundamental health and safety issue”. It said it had in recent years introduced “mandatory company-wide training dedicated to respectful behaviours, improvements to facilities such as lighting, signage and CCTV coverage, increased security presence and stricter controls on alcohol consumption”. BHP will limit drinking at its mining camps to four standard drinks a day from July, but said that policy was introduced in line with Australian health guidelines not in response to reports of disrespectful behaviour.

I’m afraid it won’t be a memorial for very much longer.</p> <p>It might be a place of entertainment but in my view it will not be the place of remembrance that I grew up with.</p> </blockquote>

around the world.</p> <p>To try and turn it into a theme park or a place of entertainment, whatever words we want to use, is not right.</p> </blockquote> <p>Barrie said he is most concerned that in the pursuit of a “bigger and better” attraction, future generations of Australians will lose the opportunity to quietly reflect on the country’s military history.</p> <p>The National Capital Authority has given the nod for early works at the memorial, including the demolition of Anzac Hall.<br></p> <p>At least 140 trees will be removed as part of the redevelopment, which will eventually be replaced by 250 native trees.<br></p> <p>The NCA, which has published a 1200-page consultation report, received 601 submissions during its consultation process, of which just three were in support.<br></p> <p>Key concerns were the need for the expansion, tree removal, the impacts on heritage values and the cost.<br></p> <p>The memorial argues the project will address constraints to the existing use of the building, improve the overall visitor and veterans’ experience and maintain its significance as a national cultural institution.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time

Here are some more details. A woman has been mauled to death by three dogs she was minding in the Queensland city of Maryborough, reports AAP. The woman, aged in her 30s or 40s, suffered horrific injuries when the animals turned on her at a Milton Road property about 9am on Tuesday. The three mixed-breed dogs have been seized by the local council and are expected to be destroyed. Acting inspector Wade Lee says the woman suffered head chest and arm injuries. Police believe the dogs belong to someone else and the woman had been taking care of them. Paramedics were called but she died at the scene. Lee told reporters: The dogs were in an enclosed yard. At this stage it is just a very tragic accident. Police have not named the woman. AAP also has more on the new NSW Labor deputy leader. Londonderry MP Prue Car has been appointed deputy leader of NSW Labor, putting an end to weeks of party instability. The former shadow education minister was elected unanimously on Tuesday, when the party also selected Penny Sharpe and John Graham as joint upper house leaders. In a statement, Car said she was excited to work with newly minted leader Chris Minns. Carr said: Like Chris, I understand the pressures on family budgets and the impact of the outrageous cost of [road] tolls. Like Chris, I want to see our schools properly funded and staffed. It will be an honour to serve as deputy leader of my party and to help take a positive vision for NSW to the 2023 election. With all leadership positions filled, the party is hoping to put a damaging few weeks behind them. NSW Labor was thrown into turmoil when Jodi McKay resigned as leader on 28 May, alleging destabilisation within the party. Let’s take a quick look at the markets, via AAP. Shares have climbed to a record high on the Australian market, with property and information technology stocks faring best. The ASX200 had peaked at 7315.6 points by 1200 AEST although gains were relatively tame across the market. Property shares led the way and were higher by 0.82%. Information technology stocks were next best and higher by 0.69 per cent. Shares in materials, financials and energy were little changed. The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index was higher by 8.9 points, or 0.12%, to 7290.8 at 1200 AEST. The All Ordinaries was up by 11.8 points, or 0.15%, to 7543.4. There were slight falls on US markets amid a lack of market-moving news. Thanks Matilda. Luke Henriques-Gomes here. I’ll be with you for the next short while.

Liberal senator Andrew Bragg says he believes Australians will support a legislated voice to parliament and an amendment to the constitution that obliges the commonwealth to ensure that Indigenous peoples are heard. Bragg – the backbencher who is leading efforts to persuade colleagues to adopt the Uluru statement – will use a speech to the Sydney Institute on Tuesday night to try and map a pathway through the Coalition’s internal differences. Bragg’s efforts have also been backed by the New South Wales premier, Gladys Berejiklian, who used remarks at a book launch earlier this week to argue the Uluru statement contains “deeply liberal ideals”. In endorsing Bragg’s campaign, Berejiklian also noted “a growing mood for change on the issue of reconciliation”. You can read the full report below: An 18-year-old man from NSW is fighting for his life in a coma after he was crushed by a whale in a freak accident on the state’s south coast, reports Tiffanie Turnbull from AAP. Friends Nick and Matt were fishing in waters off Narooma on Sunday when the whale surfaced and landed on their boat. Both men were injured, but 18-year-old Nick was rushed to hospital in Canberra with a broken neck and severe head injuries. He remains in a coma. Family friend Carmen Bartley said the pair had no warning and no idea the whale was nearby. A GoFundMe appeal for donations was started to help cover Nick’s medical expenses. Here Bartley wrote: At this stage, we don’t know when he will wake up, or how this has affected his brain. Police on Tuesday issued an appeal for boaties to be alert, with whale migration season bringing scores of the animals to NSW waters. If, like me, you are struggling to keep up with where all the exposure sites are, Guardian Australia have you covered. (Not even speaking as an employee but just a Melburnian, can I just say the explainers below have been a lifesaver!) Here are all the Victorian sites: And don’t worry, we have NSW covered for you as well: Wild winds are easing after battering Victoria overnight, prompting more than 100 calls for help, as a large air mass from the Antarctic brings damaging weather across several states. A severe weather warning for parts of the Victoria’s north-east and Gippsland regions was cancelled early on Tuesday morning following strong overnight winds. Alpine areas including Mount Buller and Mount William recorded wind gusts over 100km/h to 8am on Tuesday. Closer to Melbourne, Kilmore (91km/h) and Fawkner (72km/h) north of the city were also hit by the strong gusts. You can read the full report below: After the ousting of NSW Labor leader Jodi McKay, MP Chris Minns was elected by the party to the top job. This morning he officially announced his deputy leader has now been appointed, the member for Londonderry and the current shadow minister for education Prue Car. The Department of Home Affairs has issued a statement denying allegations of inaction or mistreatment of the youngest daughter of the Tamil family from Biloela on Christmas Island. Tharnicaa Murugappan was evacuated from Christmas Island with her mother, Priya, on Monday evening to get medical treatment after Tharnicaa had been unwell for 10 days, with a fever, vomiting, diarrhoea and dizziness. Family friend Angela Fredericks told ABC News Breakfast Tharnicaa was being treated for a blood infection, sepsis, potentially caused by untreated pneumonia, questioning why it had taken so long for the three-year-old to get treatment from health officials on Christmas Island. The Department of Home Affairs issued a statement on Tuesday strongly denying any delay in medical care: The minor has been receiving medical treatment and daily monitoring on Christmas Island consistent with medical advice. This has included an IHMS general practitioner and the Christmas Island Hospital. As soon as the ABF was advised by the treating medical practitioners that the minor required medical treatment in Western Australia, the minor was transferred to a hospital in Western Australia. The Australian Border Force strongly denies any allegations of inaction or mistreatment of individuals in its care. OK, there will be a police press conference about the woman who was killed by dogs in Queensland at 11.45 am where we should get some more updates. But for now, Queensland police have confirmed they were called to a Milton Road address in Maryborough just after 9am. They had received reports that several dogs, they believe three, were attacking a person. Victorian testing commander Jeroen Weimar says a vaccination hub has been made a tier-three exposure site, with those who were there asked to monitor for symptoms. We had two cases that tested positive yesterday. Both existed in primary close contacts. We identified, as a result of that, a number of additional exposure sites. To correct the earlier statement, one positive case had a brief visit to the vaccination centre at Jeff’s Shed yesterday afternoon. That is now a tier 3 exposure site. They completed their test and they went off and got – tried to get a vaccination. They were advised to go back to isolation. We have two primary close contacts at the exhibition site now who dealt with the individual. It is a tier 3 PPE environment. It is well controlled. We’re confident there is no wider risk to the public but out of caution, we have listed it as a tier 3 site. 7 News is reporting that a woman has died after being mauled by a pack of dogs in Queensland. I’ll bring you more updates as soon as I can. Acting premier James Merlino has come out swinging against the Victorian Liberals after they spent the morning demanding Daniel Andrews release details of his back injury in March, fuelling the flames of a number of conspiracy theories currently circulating. We are dealing with a global pandemic, for goodness sake. I treat it with the contempt that it deserves. This is more about how the Liberal party treat people. No decency, no respect, they should be ashamed of themselves. I am honestly not going to spend much time on this. I think it is a disgraceful act by the Liberal party ... They should be ashamed of themselves, quite frankly. You can’t put to bed conspiracy nutters and if the Liberal party want to act disgracefully, that is a matter for them. Merlino has said again that developments today haven’t changed the timeline when it comes to the lockdown. I can’t foreshadow anything today, other than to reassure all Victorians that today doesn’t change our plans. We remain on track to provide further easing of restrictions in regional Victoria and careful easing of restrictions in Melbourne. We remain absolutely on track to deliver that. That is by virtue of the excellent work of our contact tracers. Merlino noted that the government was is considering easing the travel restrictions between Melbourne and regional Victoria on Friday. It remains the public health advice that for a period of time, we will have different settings between regional Victoria and metropolitan Melbourne. That will extend beyond any announcements that we will make later in the week. We wanted to be upfront and honest with people at the earliest opportunity, particularly because we’re coming up to the long weekend, so we are on track for an easing of restrictions, as planned this week, but there will be different settings for a period of time between regional Victoria and Melbourne. No local Covid-19 cases in NSW in case you were wondering! The home affairs minister, Karen Andrews, has said the government is looking at a “range of resettlement options” when asked about the fate of Tamil family from Biloela. The three-year-old, Australian-born youngest daughter of the family, Tharnicaa, was airlifted out of Christmas Island on Monday evening after 10 days of symptoms including a fever and taken to Perth Children’s hospital, where advocates say she has been provided antibiotics and could potentially have sepsis. In her role, Andrews has the power to intervene at any moment and allow the family to remain in Australia, but she said on Monday she could not comment on their future because negotiations on resettlement for a number of asylum seekers in Australia is currently under way: We are going through the process now of investigating a range of resettlement options in relation to a number of different circumstances here in Australia. I can’t make public commentary on that at the moment because I don’t want to disrupt those negotiations. It is the first time resettlement has been floated as an option by the government, previously Andrews had indicated the family could be put into the community on Christmas Island while their legal process is still ongoing. The family has been held in detention on Christmas Island since late 2019, after an emergency court injunction prevented their removal from Australia to Sri Lanka while a court case was underway. Gosh, we got so caught up on the Delta link I forgot to mention where those two local cases of Covid-19 today came from. Here is acting premier James Merlino from before with that information. One is a child linked to the west Melbourne outbreak, one is a household contact of a worker linked to the Arcare Maidstone outbreak. Both have limited community exposure and Jerome can speak to that later in terms of answers any questions. A number of exposure sites were put onto the website last night and we encourage all Victorians to continue to check that website and follow that health advice. While we never want to see new cases, it is reassuring that we are again seeing these cases with clear links to existing outbreaks. Prof Cheng said the returned traveller lives in the Glen Ira local government area, but confirmed that as he only returned there after being clear of his Covid-19 diagnosis and left hotel quarantine it’s unlikely he has spread the virus to the area. Again, just as anyone in Victoria, if you are unwell, please get tested. We are not particularly concerned about his movements after he was discharged from hotel quarantine because we don’t think he was infectious but for the abundance of caution we are obviously following up his contacts as well. Cheng says there may be a missing link between the returned traveller and the family infected with the Delta variants of Covid-19. Reporter: You are working on the fact there is probably a missing link between the west Melbourne family and this man? Cheng: At this stage that’s the hypothesis we are working on but obviously if there was any direct interaction we would want to know that. We don’t know that at this stage. Reporter: Just one missing link with those dates do you think it would just be the one? Cheng: We can’t really tell. I think in terms of timing, yes, that probably is about right but we didn’t – the first person in the North Melbourne cluster became symptomatic probably around the 25th. One of those cases was thought to be historical by that time so there is still a little bit of uncertainty about which exactly was the first case and therefore that determines how many people might be in between. Last week the Australian reported that a hotel quarantine facility has stored dirty linen from positive cases inside bins in an underground car park that local residents also has access to. This was at the Ibis in Melbourne. This most recent hotel quarantine breach case spent time in an Ibis hotel but Prof Cheng could not confirm which location. Reporter: Have you guys been examining whether or not that situation may have contributed to this leak?... Correction Victoria commissioner Emma Cassar: We have investigated those allegations and can confirm that there is no sharing of entries with the residents. The residents actually enter on the opposite side of the building and myself and two of our deputy state controllers of health inspected that and we are satisfied with the controls in place. If you are wondering when this hotel quarantine case might have infected someone in the community, deputy chief health officer Prof Allen Cheng has you covered: The first possibility is that the case transmitted to or was infected by another passenger on the plane and that that person has gone on to infect someone in the community. The second possibility is that the case transmitted after he left hotel quarantine. The third is that the case transmitted to a staff member somewhere along their journey from the airport to transport to the first hotel to transport to the second hotel and then out to the community. And then the fourth possibility is that the case transmitted to a hotel resident who has then transmitted to the community after their quarantine stay. We have addressed all of these and some of these are still ongoing investigations. The government services minister, Danny Pearson, says health authorities are still trying to work out how the returned traveller accidentally spread Covid-19 into the community. The traveller arrived from Sri Lanka on 8 May and tested positive that same day. He was transferred from the Novatel Ibis quarantine hotel to the Holiday Inn health hotel on 14 May. He completed his quarantine and was released on 23 May. Pearson investigations remain ongoing but he can so far confirm the following: There were 24 people on the traveller’s plane including crew, all passengers tested negative. All Skybus crew from that shift tested negative. 268 CQV staff worked at the hotel IBIS on 8 and 9 May and 360 staff at the health hotel. No positive tests have been identified to date and staff surveillance testing is being examined. All 12 residents housed on the same floor in the Novatel Ibis health hotel have tested negative. None of the residents in the health hotel during this period had the virus. All CQV staff at the hotel Ibis and Holiday Inn were vaccinated by 3 May. And Merlino hasn’t missed a beat using the news of yet another hotel quarantine break to attack the federal government’s reliance on the system. Hotels are built for tourists, not for managing infectious diseases. There have been at least 21 breaches in hotel quarantine right around this country. Just in the last month, we have seen three outbreaks, one in South Australia and two in WA. Despite all the protections that we put in place, appropriately put in place, vaccination of staff, daily testing of staff, PPE, N95 masks, ventilation works just to name a few, we cannot eliminate risk in this environment. The fact that Howard Springs is the only system in the country that has seen no breaches really speaks for itself. That’s why we pushed so hard to get a purpose-built quarantine facility. Howard Springs is the only facility in this country that has not seen a breach and that’s exactly why we have been pushing for this purpose-built facility. The best-case scenario was that this was done a year ago. The next best scenario is that we get it done immediately. I am very pleased, as we have heard over the last few days, that that’s received the support of the federal government. We will get this facility built – this purpose-built facility – built as quickly as possible and in the mean time we will do our absolute best within our hotel quarantine system to reduce risk as much as is humanely possible. While Merlino was certainly making no promises, he sounded cautiously optimistic about Melbourne’s ability to at least partially come out of lockdown at the end of the week, and for further restrictions to be eased in regional Victoria. Thanks to their outstanding work we remain on track to later in this week announce, as we have said we have planned to do all along, further easing of restriction in regional Victoria and careful easing of restrictions in Melbourne. This cluster was discovered after the lockdown was in place and nothing about today changes our plan. So I just want to send that very reassuring message to all Victorians. Nothing about today changes our plans. Thanks to the outstanding work of our contact tracing team, we remain on track to deliver a further easing of restrictions in regional Victoria and easing of restrictions in Melbourne. Huzzah! Victorian officials have finally linked the mystery Delta variant outbreak to a returned traveller from hotel quarantine (and not from NSW). As we advised last week with assistance from the Doherty Institute, we have been checking all known positive cases against the genomic sequencing for the cases in this cluster. I can confirm today that we have now found a match between a returned traveller who entered hotel quarantine in Melbourne on 8 May and this cluster. While we have a genomic link, we do not currently have an ep deem logical link, further investigations are underway to see if we are able to establish any contact between the returned traveller and these families. There’s currently no definitive understanding of where a transmission events may have occurred but we are investigating all possibilities from the plane to travel to hotel. Speaking of Victoria, acting premier James Merlino is speaking now to give a Covid-19 update. Oh my gosh. The “Daniel Andrews falling conspiracy theory” drama in Victoria keeps getting funnier today! With permission from the premier, Ambulance Victoria has released the details of their call out for his injury. The home affairs minister, Karen Andrews, says the department is considering “a range of resettlement options” for the Biloela family. This is a considerably softer approach than other government figures have indicated today. We are going through the process now of investigating a range of resettlement options in relation to a number of different circumstances here in Australia. I can’t make public commentary on that at the moment because I don’t want to disrupt those negotiations. Andrews was then asked why she won’t make a captains call on the Biloela family and allow them to return to their home in regional Queensland. As the prime minister already said, there is already a matter before the court in relation to the issue with the young child. That child is now receiving appropriate medical care in Perth. (Worth remember that those court cases absolutely do not stop Andrews from using ministerial discretion to bring them home straight away.) Questions have turned now to the Biloela family, with Morrison being asked when a decision on their case will be made. As you know, this is a matter going through the court’s process that they’ve initiated and there are some present medical issues involving the family. And they will continue to receive every medical care and that care and where they are treated will continue to be determined by doctors, by the medical professionals who advise us on these matters. Kershaw is laying out why the APF need the extended telecommunication security bill passed in order to tackle crime on the dark web. We’re really encouraging the parliament to pass that bill in particular and the IPO bill. Because we need to be ahead. We need to be a step ahead and encrypted comms and going dark on the dark web. As you know, there’s multiple crimes. If you go on there right now, you can purchase whatever you want. There’s proliferation of child sexual abuse material on the dark web. It’s an absolute disgrace. So for us, that’s a criminal marketplace that we can’t actually penetrate without that legislation. According to AFP commissioner Reece Kershaw, underworld kingpins are turning on each other after the arrests. Well, they all turn on each other. The other thing that we learnt is that they actually do a lot of business behind each other’s backs, including the presidents of various groups and organisations for personal wealth. So there’s going to be a whole lot of disruption there, and our state police colleagues are on alert for that. Because there’s no doubt going to be some tension within the whole system about who owes what drug debt and so on. So that was pretty brazen to see that they were actually disloyal to their own groups. OK, so we have got through all the cool things the AFP has down. Scott Morrison is now coming in full force with his pitch for getting his increased police powers bill. There are three things that we need to do. One of them does relate to air and the transport security laws that are in this country. The first one is that there’s is surveillance legislation amendment which is about identifying and disrupting, and the AFP and the ACIC powers to combat serious crime on the dark web, and in circumstances where anonomising technologies with detection of serious crime. We have law in the parliament at the moment which does not have bipartisan support, which we need support for, to give them powers to do that. The telecommunications legislation amendment – international production orders bill ... That does not have bipartisan support and we need it passed. And the third one is the Transport Security Amendment of Serious Crime bill. That is the bill that is needed to stop organised criminals getting access to our walls and to our airports. We have sought to have this bill passed through three successive parliaments. And it still continues to be opposed by Labor. Now, this is critical to ensure that criminals don’t get on to our walls. That they can’t access security credentials and things of that nature. I don’t know why they’re being protective. I can’t give you an answer to that. We want to shut it down. Kershaw says the infiltration into this encrypted app allowed authorities to prevent a mass shooting, although he did not go into details as to where this would have taken place. He said this was not intended as a terrorist act. It’s organised crime. So that particular case will come out later on where they were using a machine gun and potentially at a cafe where people would have been no doubt harmed. We were able to, with the cooperation of that particular state police force, take out that individual before they were able to do that. Kershaw said he could not give more details as arrests into that incident were still being carried out. OK, now we are getting some of the details of this fake FBI app. Reporter: Do you think that the people you were targeting had any idea that you were listening and watching? AFP Commissioner Reece Kershaw: No. Let me be clear. When you get access and it will come out in court, you’ll see that all they talk about is drugs, violence, hits on each other, innocent people who are going to be murdered. A whole range of things ... It would be like, “I need 1,000 kilos at this price”. Very brazen. No attempt to hide behind any kind of codified kind of conversation. Including we’ll have a speed boat to meet you at this. And this is who will be doing that? Heads up, we are expecting to hear from the Victorian government and health authorities at 10.30am. OK so that’s the achievements, here comes the “war on drugs” rhetoric from prime minister Scott Morrison. People sitting at home might be thinking – what can we do to help the AFP? In this battle against organised crime in this country. I want to make a few comments about illicit drug use in this country. There’s nothing social about illicit drug use in this country. It fuels organised crime in this country. It fuels human misery in this country and in many parts of the world. There’s nothing social about it. It’s dangerous. And all of us have a responsibility, all of us have a responsibility in our own relationships and our own families, in our own communities, to be doing what we can to encourage positive behaviours, positive behaviours that don’t indulge illicit drug use. Illicit drug use ruins lives and it fuels organised crime. Cue the appeal to the children: The AFP will do their job and we’ll make sure that they’re resourced to do their job. We also have a job to do. Let’s keep Australia safe. Let’s ensure that illicit drug use in this country doesn’t take our children. Kershaw: This was brought out of the close long-standing relationship between the AFP and the FBI. Our relationships and international networks were mobilised and it is these partnerships which have made this operation a success. Partnering with the AFP, the AFP had access to a new encrypted application named ANOM. And began running it without the knowledge of the criminal underworld. And the AFP provided the highly skilled technical staff and capability to decrypt and read these encrypted communications sent over ANOM in real time. Giving law enforcement an edge that it had never had before. Essentially, we have been in the back pockets of organised crime and operationalised the criminal takedown like we have never seen. The Australian federal police commissioner, Reece Kershaw, says 224 people have been charged so far. As the minister stated, more than 4,000 officers from law enforcement in Australia have been involved in executing over 525 search warrants in every mainland state in Australia. We have arrested the alleged kingmakers behind these crimes. Prevented mass shootings in suburbs and frustrated serious and organised crime by seizing their ill-gotten wealth. As of today, we have charged 224 alleged offenders, including 525 charges laid. Shut down six clandestine laboratories and acted on 21 threats to kill, including saving a family of five. And seized 104 firearms and weapons and almost $45m in cash. And these figures are likely to increase over the coming days. Collectively, these alleged offenders are facing jail terms that could run into hundreds of years and some of the charges they are facing carry life imprisonment. It looks like the prime minister is using news the massive drug to try and gain support for giving the Australian federal police, and law enforcement in general, greater powers. (A line of rhetoric that always make me really nervous.) But what’s important as we go forward from this point is not just the support that we continue to provide that we see in the budget, but we need to continue to provide our law enforcement authorities with the powers and the authorities that they need to do this job. I’ll going into this later in questions, but there is a series of legislation, not just in this term, but in some cases over three terms. They need these powers to do their job. The AFP and our law enforcement agencies who support them need the support of our parliament to continue to do the job that they do to continue to keep Australians safe. Our government won’t shirk from that and we call on all of those in the parliament to do that as we have done for such a long time and to get the results that in particular we’ve seen today. Morrison: Operation Ironside has now charged hundreds of alleged offenders. Seized millions of dollars in criminal processes. Removed weapons from our streets and saved lives. And we’ll continue to. It is an ongoing operation. The operation puts Australia at the forefront of the fight against criminals who peddle in misery and ultimately, it will keep our communities and Australians safe. More than 4,000 police officers across Australia have been involved in this operation. There’s not a day that goes past when I am not thankful for the work of all of our police. All of our police all around the country. They step up for our protection. They take upon themselves great risks. They see things. They’re involved in these things that the rest of the citizens don’t have to see. And for that, we owe every single police officer our great thanks and afford them our great respect. So let’s talk about this drug bust news. The Australian federal police hasn’t put out a full statement yet but media reports today suggest more than 100 members of Australia’s underworld including the “mafia” and bikie group have been arrested in a huge international crime sting. For years the AFP worked with the FBI to trick underworld figures into communicating via an encrypted app known as AN0M. Unfortunately for the underworld figures, the police created the app. Authorities say they were able to read up to 25 million messages and uncovered 21 murder plots, seized more than 3,000kg of drugs and found $35m in cash. The prime minister is speaking about the operation now: Today, the Australian government, as part of a global operation, has struck a heavy blow against organised crime – not just in this country, but one that will echo around organised crime around the world. This is a watershed moment in Australian law enforcement history. This has not been independently confirmed by Guardian Australia as of yet but advocates for the Bioela family say three-year-old Tharnicaa has been diagnosed with pneumonia after been medically evacuated from detention in Christmas Island to Perth. It’s been a bit of a heavy morning so far, so here is some dinosaur news from the Guardian’s amazing new science reporter Donna Lu: A new species of dinosaur discovered in south-west Queensland has been officially recognised as the largest ever found in Australia and among the biggest in the world. The Australotitan cooperensis, a plant-eating dinosaur of the family known as titanosaurs, likely lived between 92m and 96m years ago, during the Cretaceous period. It was between 25m and 30m long, stood between 5m and 6.5m from the ground to its hip and had a very long neck and tail, making it similar in appearance to well-known dinosaurs such as Brachiosaurus and Apatosaurus. You can read the full story below: Less than 3% of Australians over 16 have been fully vaccinated against coronavirus but health chiefs are tipping numbers will soar in coming weeks. The sluggish national rollout of jabs continues to spark concern with Melbourne in the grips of another lockdown-inducing outbreak, reports Matt Coughlan from AAP. While the immunisation program is ramping up, just 613,000 people, or about 2.9% of the nation’s adults, have received both doses. Chief nursing officer Prof Alison McMillan told Sky News on Tuesday she is confident that figure will grow significantly with many people nearing the 12-week gap between AstraZeneca shots. Case numbers have remained relatively low in Victoria but an emergence of the Delta and Kappa strains prevalent in India are causing authorities concern. McMillan declared vaccination would be the only way to counter emerging variants. There are multiple strains and we will continue to see Covid adapt and mutate – that’s what these viruses do. We’re likely to see other strains emerging. The sooner we can get the world vaccinated, the less likely it is that it can mutate. It mutates and finds it easier to do when there’s a significant population infected at any one time. More than 5 million doses have been administered nationwide including more than 1 million over the past 10 days. We are just waiting on a press conference from the AFP and prime minister on massive international drug bust operations and arrests across Australia and New Zealand. We heard from the NZ police just before: [There were] 37 search warrants resulting in the arrest of 35 people who are appearing before the court today on serious drug dealing, money laundering and other conspiracy-type charges. To date we’ve seized during the course of these operations about 8.6kg of meth that came in through the border. Yesterday, we recovered about 20kg of methamphetamine, over $1 million in cash, four firearms, multiple kilos of iodine and we restrained about $3.7 million of assets to date. Warrants are coming in and we expect a number of other arrests to be undertaken. The prime minister is expected to speak to the media about this around 9.30 am. Support for the Coalition’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic has fallen to its lowest level since the outbreak began, as almost half of all voters view the federal government less favourably than they did a year ago. But the findings, contained in the latest Guardian Essential poll, also show that voters in locked-down Victoria are spreading the blame for the latest outbreak, with both the Coalition and the Andrews government losing ground over the past month among voters in the state. Overall, one in four voters now believe the Morrison government is doing a “very poor” or “quite poor” job of managing the pandemic, the highest level since March last year, and six percentage points higher than when the same question was asked a fortnight ago. You can read the full story below: Oh, and no new local cases in Queensland in case anyone was wondering. (They weren’t.) The daily numbers are out and it seems there are two new locally acquired cases. A former defence chief has blasted the approval of a $500m redevelopment of the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, reports AAP. Retired admiral Chris Barrie has been a vocal opponent of the major project, fearing it will completely undermine the national institution. On Tuesday he told ABC radio: I guess the game is over in terms of the fact it is going to happen, but I’m afraid it won’t be a memorial for very much longer. It might be a place of entertainment but in my view it will not be the place of remembrance that I grew up with. Barrie said the redevelopment would turn the memorial into a theme park. I recall the place of remembrance that I used to take visitors to as being unique around the world. To try and turn it into a theme park or a place of entertainment, whatever words we want to use, is not right. Barrie said he is most concerned that in the pursuit of a “bigger and better” attraction, future generations of Australians will lose the opportunity to quietly reflect on the country’s military history. The National Capital Authority has given the nod for early works at the memorial, including the demolition of Anzac Hall. At least 140 trees will be removed as part of the redevelopment, which will eventually be replaced by 250 native trees. The NCA, which has published a 1200-page consultation report, received 601 submissions during its consultation process, of which just three were in support. Key concerns were the need for the expansion, tree removal, the impacts on heritage values and the cost. The memorial argues the project will address constraints to the existing use of the building, improve the overall visitor and veterans’ experience and maintain its significance as a national cultural institution. Up to 30% of residents in some aged care homes have not taken up a Covid-19 vaccination, according to new data that has prompted an investigation into the high rates of non-uptake. Council on the Ageing chief executive Ian Yates said the most recent data shared with stakeholders was collated last week and showed most homes reported a refusal rate of between 5% and 15%. The data does not reveal why residents had declined the vaccine, but Yates said doctors would not have recommended it for a significant number due to underlying health conditions. The federal government was now focusing on homes with the highest levels of non-uptake to uncover why so many residents had chosen not to get vaccinated against Covid-19, he said. The minister for senior Australians and aged care services, Richard Colbeck, said: The department of health is examining overall consent data to review instances where consent rates are significantly low as part of planning for any required follow up activity with these facilities. But he said aged care facilities are responsible for supporting and obtaining residents’ consent to receive both doses of the vaccine. This includes early discussions on consent, including engagement with family and guardians, and treating general practitioners, as required. I’m sorry, I’m still laughing at the idea that Daniel Andrews would have been filming himself when he slipped on the steps. That’s wild. Coronavirus vaccines are being made available to all National Disability Insurance Scheme participants aged over 16, reports Daniel McCulloch from AAP. National cabinet has approved the rapid expansion to speed up the sluggish vaccine rollout across the vulnerable disability sector. It comes after dedicated vaccination hubs for people with disabilities, support workers and primary carers were given the green light. The disability minister, Linda Reynolds, made a statement this morning: We are working quickly to provide more locations for people to receive their vaccination in safe, accessible settings ... It is a particularly important step forward that both paid and unpaid carers of NDIS participants are now able to get the vaccination as soon as possible. The number of vaccinated NDIS participants is slowly growing. Almost 40,500 NDIS participants (16%) have received at least one dose of the vaccine. More than 7,800 NDIS participants living in group homes and aged care settings – 28% of the population – have been given at least one jab. However, people in disability care were considered the highest priority group and the vaccine rollout is still months behind schedule. Now, this fairly bold move by the Victorian opposition hasn’t gone unnoticed by the state government. Treasurer Tim Pallas has called for them to make a public apology and labelled the theories “QAnon craziness”: This is nonsense ... we know it’s nonsense. What happened to Daniel Andrews was an unfortunate but very serious spinal injury. There’s nothing more to it ... Perhaps they [the Liberals] need to issue a public apology. Oh, and by the way, the leader of the Victorian opposition, Michael O’Brien, is also involved: Yikes, some weird stuff is going on in the Victoria parliament this morning. So the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has been off for a number of months now after falling on some wet steps and fracturing his spine. Since this happened a number of conspiracy theories have been bubbling away. But now it seems the state opposition is willing to play into these bizarre rumours publicly. Here is what the shadow treasurer, Louise Staley, had to say at a press conference this morning: Nobody’s got footage of the stairs. Nobody’s got really any idea where it happened and this is a very visual world these days where we seem to have everything out there on the media but not this. (I know personally I often film myself getting ready for work. If you’re lucky I’ll release the video of me making a cup of tea at 6.45am.) When asked by AAP reporter Benita Kolovos why she was “fuelling conspiracy theories”, Staley said: Well, the easiest way to stop any of these conspiracy theories – which I’m not playing into – is for these questions to be answered. Just staying on that ABC radio interview with Nationals MP Matt Canavan for a moment. He has been asked his views on the Biloela family’s situation, saying he believes the multimillion-dollar effort to keep the family in detention is worth it to protect Australia’s borders: I think what is “worth it” is that we do have strong border protections in this country that has made sure that we don’t have the atrocious and tragic trade of people that we saw around 10 years ago ... Of all of the courts, none have found that this family has refugee status. Therefore, they do not have a right to stay in this country. Now, they have chosen with their lawyers to fight and contest that. Now that’s their right, but of course, that leaves them ... in a place of limbo, if you like ... It’s certainly tragic what’s happened here to this young girl, but, given they have been found not to have refugee status ... they really cannot stay in this country. But they also have rights here, because we are a country of rights and laws of rights to challenge and contest that, but that does take time. NSW nationals MP Matt Canavan has labelled the idea of vaccine passports “un-Australian” after the former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull said on Monday that the government should seriously consider them. The passport proposal suggests certain activities, most centrally international travel, would require proof of vaccination, but Canavan told ABC Radio this morning that this went against Australian’s human rights: The idea that [being] free to go to the movies to travel to other states of Australia is somehow a gift to be given from the government is absolutely the wrong way around. In this free and fair country that we have, we have those freedoms, they are ours, they’re not given to us or gifted to us by the governance I say, they’re rights at birth as Australian citizens. They should never or only very rarely be restricted. And I don’t see any reason why at this stage we need to introduce vaccine passports. I’m confident that we will get to a high level of vaccinations as we do with other vaccines in this country, and then we’ll be able to get on with their lives. Not everyone will be vaccinated, but it will probably cover almost all vulnerable people. A former Bunnings Warehouse on the NSW north coast will be converted over the next six weeks into the state’s second Covid-19 vaccination hub. The centre, at Belmont in Lake Macquarie, is expected to be ready to administer up to 20,000 jabs a week from mid-July. The hub is the second for NSW, which already has a centre at Homebush in Sydney’s west delivering up to 5,000 injections a day, reports AAP. Premier Gladys Berejiklian made the announcement in a statement this morning: We are planning to replicate that model in the Hunter region, so we can quickly and safely vaccinate as many people as possible across NSW. The Lake Macquarie centre will employ up to 100 nurses, 25 pharmacists or pharmacy technicians plus about 200 other support staff. About 150 people will be hard at work converting the former Bunnings site over the next six weeks before it opens to residents in the region. The centre will administer both the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines, with bookings required. Labor Senator Kristina Keneally, who visited the Biloela family on Christmas Island this year, has fronted media this morning calling on the government to “bring them home”. She spoke to ABC News Breakfast just before: The family’s lawyers have put information in front of the minister about [older daughter] Kopika and Tharnicaa’s ongoing physical and mental health impacts of detention. And this latest emergency – this acute medical emergency – is unfortunately just a most recent example of the ongoing impacts that detention is having on these two little Australian-born girls. Today, I say to the minister for home affairs, and the minister for immigration, it’s time to bring this sorry saga, what we as a country are doing to these two little Australian-born girls to an end. Bring them home to Biloela, a town who wants and loves them. Keneally said the whole family should have been allowed to travel with the three-year-old on the medevac flight, rather than just her mother, Priya: All of this heartbreak for this family. The last thing they need right now is to be separated from one another and the last thing of course is this little girl, Tharnicaa, needs, is this type of medical emergency. Just back on the Biloela family, there is some controversy about the level of medical care three-year-old Tharnicaa may have received. Advocates for the family are alleging the detention centre staff didn’t take Tharnicaa to the hospital on Christmas Island until Sunday, despite multiple requests from her mother. A spokesperson for the Department of Home Affairs said both the department and Australian Border Force were committed to the welfare of detainees in immigration detention: Healthcare services for detainees on Christmas Island are broadly comparable with those available within the Australian community under the Australian public health system ... The ABF facilitates access to nurses, doctors and specialists for all members of the family. Good morning all, It’s Matilda Boseley here, ready to dive into this very lovely Tuesday with you. First up, it’s worth talking about what’s happening to the Biloela family, the Tamil family of four being held in immigration detention on Christmas Island. The youngest daughter, three-year-old Tharnicaa, has been medically evacuated to Perth with a suspected blood infection, renewing calls from advocates for the government to let the family return to their home in rural Queensland. A medical evacuation flight carrying Tharnicaa and her mother Priya landed at Perth airport on Monday evening, advocates for the family confirmed. They say Tharnicaa had been unwell for 10 days and might have septicaemia, experienced vomiting, diarrhoea, dizziness and a temperature of more than 40 degrees. Her mum Priya has released a short statement about the situation: I am feeling very scared and worried for my little girl ... She has been sick for many days, it took a long time for her to get to the hospital. She is already asking for her papa, it is going to be very hard being away from her Dad and sister. It is very hard for our family to be separated when our daughter is sick. Back in Victoria, the state is entering its 12th day of lockdown (I type from lockdown), and all eyes are on today’s numbers. Yesterday people were alarmed to see the state record 11 new locally acquired cases on Monday, fearing this would almost guarantee a third week of “stay-at-home orders”, but it was quickly clarified in the daily press conference that new cases are all close contacts of existing cases or people who are in quarantine, and there weren’t even any fresh exposure sites relating to these cases.

The Victoria Cross recipient’s trial has gone behind closed doors on day two, with national security-sensitive information to be discussed in camera. Roberts-Smith, 42, is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times for defamation over a series of reports published in 2018 which he alleges are defamatory because they portrayed him as someone who “broke the moral and legal rules of military engagement” and committed war crimes, including murder. Roberts-Smith, a decorated former corporal in the SAS, has consistently denied the allegations as “baseless”, saying they were “completely without any foundation in truth”. Roberts-Smith’s barrister, Bruce McClintock, returned on Tuesday morning to one murder allegation concerning the alleged killing of an Afghan adolescent who was riding in a Toyota Hilux when it was stopped by an Australian SAS patrol in 2012. In the newspapers’ defence documents before court, they allege that “on or about 21 October 2012” Roberts-Smith was part of a patrol that stopped a Toyota Hilux carrying three Afghan men and a teenager, aged between 15 and 18 years old. The adolescent was “searched and detained by Person 16 (an SAS soldier anonymised by the court) and then handed over to Roberts-Smith’s patrol for questioning, together with the other occupants of the Hilux”. “At the time the Afghan adolescent was visibly extremely nervous.” The newspapers then allege: “One or two days after the mission Person 16 said to [Roberts-Smith], in substance, ‘What happened to the young bloke who was shaking like a leaf?’ “[Roberts-Smith] responded, in substance, ‘I shot that cunt in the head. Person 15 (another soldier) told me not to kill any cunts on that job so I pulled out my 9mm and shot him in the head. It was the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen.” On Monday, McClintock said the allegation was “beyond ridiculous… it’s insane”. “It’s the sort of thing that would be said by an ostentatious psychopath ... my client is not that.” McClintock told the court the Hilux was intercepted – on a different date – by another patrol, and found to be carrying insurgents and weapons. The insurgents, he said, were detained, while the adolescent was released. On Tuesday, McClintock argued the allegation would be cause for significant damages in Roberts-Smith’s favour because the reporters who published the allegation knew it to be false. Since publication, it has emerged Roberts-Smith was in a different part of Afghanistan on 21 October 2012. The “on or about” date has since been amended in the newspapers’ defence to 5 November of the same year. The newspapers were aware, McClintock argued, “that allegation was false. It follows it must have been made in bad faith.” Also on Tuesday morning, the court heard Roberts-Smith’s burgeoning public speaking business “evaporated” after the allegations of war crimes against him were published in 2018. In the 2017-2018 financial year, Roberts-Smith had earned about $320,000 through his public speaking and events business. Almost all his bookings were cancelled once the allegations were made public. He was also forced to abandon an offered partnership at a major accountancy firm. The court also heard a forensic accountant estimated his future loss of earnings at $475,000. McClintock told the trial Monday the seriousness of the allegations against Roberts-Smith, and the damage to his previously stellar reputation, “justifies the largest award of aggravated damages ever in this country”. “The more serious the attack, the greater the amount of money to vindicate,” he said on Tuesday morning. “Obviously, you don’t get really high damages for a trivial attack. These are not trivial attacks, these are allegations of murder and war crimes. There really can be nothing more serious than that.” McClintock also confirmed to court that the former governor general Dame Quentin Bryce would not - as he had previously told the court – be appearing as a reputation witness for Roberts-Smith. Bryce wrote a letter of support for Roberts-Smith in 2019 but declined to appear as a reputation witness for the former soldier. McClintock read from an email from Bryce sent to Roberts-Smith saying “she has never withdrawn her support for Mr Roberts-Smith, but she won’t be appearing as a witness for personal reasons”.","charCount":"4605","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/ben-doherty\">Ben Doherty</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2021/jun/08/ratko-mladic-to-hear-final-ruling-on-genocide-conviction","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-08T03:00:09Z","webTitle":"Ratko Mladić to hear final ruling on genocide conviction","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/08/ratko-mladic-to-hear-final-ruling-on-genocide-conviction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/jun/08/ratko-mladic-to-hear-final-ruling-on-genocide-conviction","fields":{"headline":"Ratko Mladić to hear final ruling on genocide conviction","standfirst":"<p>Hague court to rule on 10 offences for which ex-Bosnian Serb commander was given life sentence in 2017</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/22/ratko-mladic-the-warlike-youth-turned-balkan-war-criminal\">Ratko Mladić, the ‘warlike youth’ turned Balkan war criminal</a></li></ul>","trailText":"Hague court to rule on 10 offences for which ex-Bosnian Serb commander was given life sentence in 2017","byline":"Daniel Boffey in Brussels","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"07bc316ec948d5983187756a89ed55a034e8c3f0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07bc316ec948d5983187756a89ed55a034e8c3f0/0_0_3264_1960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ratko Mladić at the tribunal in The Hague in August 2020\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ratko Mladić at the tribunal in The Hague in August 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leslie Hondebrink-Herm/UN-IRMCT/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>The former Bosnian Serb commander <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ratko-mladic\">Ratko Mladić</a>, nicknamed the “butcher of Bosnia”, is facing a final day in court where he will hear judgment on his appeal against his conviction for genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.</p> <p>Twenty-six years after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/srebrenica-massacre\">Srebrenica massacre</a>, Mladić, 78, will appear at the United Nations-backed international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in The Hague on Tuesday for what is expected to be more than an hour of rulings.</p> <p>Five judges will present their conclusions on 10 offences – involving extermination, forcible transfers, terror, hostage-taking and unlawful attacks on civilians – for which Mladić was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/22/ratko-mladic-convicted-of-genocide-and-war-crimes-at-un-tribunal\">given a life sentence in 2017</a>.</p> <p>The court will also rule on the request of the UN prosecutor Serge Brammertz for a further charge of genocide to be added to the list of convictions.

Health authorities also revealed that genomic sequencing has linked the Delta strain of Covid-19 that spread in West Melbourne to a traveller who returned from Sri Lanka and entered hotel quarantine on 8 May. While he tested positive in hotel quarantine and was moved to a health hotel on 9 May before finishing quarantine on 23 May, authorities are puzzled as to how the man in his 40s transmitted the virus to other cases in the West Melbourne cluster. The man lives in the Glen Eira LGA, in Melbourne’s southeast, and the other 23 passengers on his flight, aircrew, Skybus crew, and hundreds of staff from both hotels linked to the man have tested negative. “I can confirm that so far there is no reported or obvious breach of infection prevention control protocols or anything else that would indicate a transmission has happened inside the hotel,” Danny Pearson, acting police and emergency services minister, said. Allen Cheng, Victoria’s deputy chief health officer, said of four theories authorities are exploring about how the Covid spread from the man, the “most likely” was that he transmitted the virus to another hotel guest or to a staff member when being transferred to the Holiday Inn health hotel. Of the two new cases announced on Tuesday, one is a child linked to the West Melbourne Delta variant cluster, and the other is a household contact of a worker linked to the Kappa variant outbreak at the Arcare Maidstone aged care facility. Merlino said both of the new cases have had limited community exposure, as they were primary contacts of known cases. While flagging an easing of restrictions to take effect from Friday, Merlino said public health advice meant that travel between metropolitan Melbourne and regional Victoria would continue to be restricted over the long weekend. “That will extend beyond any announcements that we will make later in the week. There are very good reasons for that. We absolutely want to run this into ground and ensure that there’s no risk of this spreading out into regional Victoria.

It is a day-by-day, hour by hour analysis about how we are tracking … We remain on track to provide that easing of restrictions to all Victorians,” Merlino said. There are now 85 local cases of Covid-19 in Victoria. Asked if the genomic discovery of the Delta variant’s origins constituted a failure of hotel quarantine, Merlino reiterated the shortcomings of hotel design and how his state has been pursuing a purpose-built quarantine facility. “We are making it as risk-free as humanely possible but it has never ever been a zero-risk environment. That is not the nature of hotels. Hotels are built for tourists. They’re not built to tackle infectious disease,” Merlino said. He also said that any purpose-built quarantine facility would act alongside hotel quarantine, and could be used to support higher risk returned travellers. Merlino was also scathing of the Victorian opposition’s demand for premier Daniel Andrews to release details of his back injury, saying the state Liberal party “should be ashamed of themselves”. Ambulance Victoria issued a statement with details of Andrews’ fall on Tuesday morning, and Merlino backed calls for the opposition to apologise. “You can’t put to bed conspiracy nutters and if the Liberal party want to act disgracefully, that is a matter for them,” Merlino said.","charCount":"3731","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/elias-visontay\">Elias Visontay</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2021/jun/08/adam-goodes-rejects-afls-hall-of-fame-offer","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-08T02:41:19Z","webTitle":"Adam Goodes rejects AFL’s Australian Football Hall of Fame offer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/jun/08/adam-goodes-rejects-afls-hall-of-fame-offer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2021/jun/08/adam-goodes-rejects-afls-hall-of-fame-offer","fields":{"headline":"Adam Goodes rejects AFL’s Australian Football Hall of Fame offer","standfirst":"<ul><li>Game’s most decorated Indigenous player retired in 2015</li><li>AFL issues another apology for its failures at the time</li></ul>","trailText":"Adam Goodes, the AFL’s most decorated Indigenous player, has rejected an offer to be inducted into the Australian Football Hall of Fame","byline":"Guardian sport","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f30f78a89846cf32bed8b9e91e972c8ff45de431\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f30f78a89846cf32bed8b9e91e972c8ff45de431/0_100_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adam Goodes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adam Goodes’ final three AFL seasons, particularly his last, were marred by ugly booing by crowds.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brendon Thorne/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Adam Goodes remains entirely disconnected from Australian rules football after the former Sydney Swans champion rejected an offer from the AFL to be inducted into the Australian Football Hall of Fame.</p> <p>The AFL’s most decorated Indigenous player cut his ties with the game after sustained booing from crowds and a lack of support from the league led to his early retirement in 2015.</p> <p>Goodes declined the AFL’s Hall of Fame invitation earlier this year, but chose not to make his decision public before this year’s induction event, originally scheduled for 22 June, so as not to draw focus away from this year’s inductees.</p> <p>The event has been postponed due to the current Covid-19 lockdown in Victoria, and following a report in the Herald Sun on Tuesday, the AFL confirmed the dual Brownlow medallist had knocked back the nomination.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/02/adam-goodes-interview-racism-walk-away-afl\">Adam Goodes: 'Instead of masking racism, we need to deal with it day-to-day'</a> </p> </aside>  <p> In 2013, Goodes called out a teenage Collingwood supporter after she called him an “ape” during a match at the MCG.

The AFL’s most decorated Indigenous player cut his ties with the game after sustained booing from crowds and a lack of support from the league led to his early retirement in 2015. Goodes declined the AFL’s Hall of Fame invitation earlier this year, but chose not to make his decision public before this year’s induction event, originally scheduled for 22 June, so as not to draw focus away from this year’s inductees. The event has been postponed due to the current Covid-19 lockdown in Victoria, and following a report in the Herald Sun on Tuesday, the AFL confirmed the dual Brownlow medallist had knocked back the nomination. In 2013, Goodes called out a teenage Collingwood supporter after she called him an “ape” during a match at the MCG.

The changes to the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) items make a number of procedures significantly cheaper for consumers, but doctors and consumer health advocates say the government should hold off on implementing them. The president of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Omar Khorshid, said on Sunday doctors and health funds needed more time to consider the impact. “The problem that we’re seeing, and the problem that we’re calling out today is that government have only just released these new changes to the schedule in the last week or so, leaving only a few weeks for doctors, health funds and others to determine what their fees are and what the arrangements will be for the future,” he said. The Consumers Health Forum also urged the government to consider a short pause on the introduction of the changes. What is the MBS? The MBS is a list of health professional services that the Australian government subsidises through Medicare. Operations, assessments, treatments and diagnostic tests all have an MBS item number assigned to them, and this item number determines how much of the cost will be subsidised by the government under the schedule. Why are the changes occurring? Medical advances mean that over time, some procedures become quicker to carry out, far less complex, and the cost of medical devices and tools can come down too. Yet often the price to the consumer, the government and private health insurers does not change to reflect those savings. Some item numbers are never even used, because the procedures they align with are outdated and have been replaced. A health economist with the Grattan Institute, Prof Stephen Duckett, said the review of the MBS was long overdue and the changes are essential to ensure patients aren’t paying too much for surgeries and treatments. There has not been a comprehensive review of the MBS and item numbers for more than a decade. “So this is about making sure the item numbers are more reflective of contemporary practice,” Duckett said. “Some of it is about getting rid of shonky billing processes. We’ve got to be updating the MBS more often, and doing so certainly benefits the taxpayer.” Was there any consultation? Yes. An independent advisory group comprising clinical experts, doctors, academics and consumer representatives, called the MBS taskforce, examined 5,700 MBS items between 2015 and 2020 to see if they needed to be amended, updated or removed. This taskforce identified services that were obsolete, outdated or even potentially unsafe. The taskforce also recommended adding new items where needed, along with broader structural changes to the MBS. They provided their recommendations to the federal government in December. A spokesperson for the health minister Greg Hunt said there has been ongoing and extensive engagement with the relevant peak bodies such as the Australian Medical Association, Australian Private Hospital Association and Private Healthcare Australia about the details of the 1 July changes. “For example, in relation to orthopaedics, there were nine meetings of the Implementation Liaison Group, which were held between May and December 2020 and discussions with key stakeholders to support effective communication of the changes are ongoing,” she said. What areas are in for the biggest changes? Orthopaedic surgery, cardiac surgery and general surgery are the areas where the most reforms will occur. It’s important to remember the changes may mean out-of-pocket costs go down. The Consumers Health Forum said on Monday many of the changes will ensure “Medicare payments reflect the latest in cost-effective and evidence-based medicine”.

New plastic and reconstructive surgery items, including general and skin surgeries, cranio-maxillofacial/oral and maxillofacial items, have also been added. But the AMA is concerned there may be procedures that see an increase in out-of-pocket costs. “In the case of hip arthroscopy, and there may be a couple of other types of surgery in orthopaedics, the gaps are likely to be very substantial and may make this surgery out of reach for Australians who are doing the right thing,” Khorshid said. But it is difficult to easily see which consultations and treatments will become cheaper or more costly. A lack of transparency around the costs of medical procedures has been an issue for years. The CEO of the Consumers Health Forum, Leanne Wells said even with the MBS reforms there still needs to be greater fee transparency for consumers. She and the Consumers Health Forum have called for a simple explainer from the government detailing the procedures affected by the MBS changes, and setting out the reasons for cost changes. “Medicare is our public health insurance scheme designed to give people universal access to subsidised care,” Wells said. “We have supported the MBS review – a review that was long overdue – as good public policy to weed out items in the Medicare Benefits Schedule that are outmoded and have a poor evidence base. Taxpayers should not be contributing to outmoded treatments and should expect the scheme they pay for to subsidise the most up-to-date and effective medicine. “All the various professional colleges were involved in these processes and it is understood the government has acted on best clinical advice in adjusting what’s included in the schedule. We were assured that this was the case and the review was not about finding savings or creating additional costs that would fall to patients.” So what’s the issue with the changes being implemented now? It’s largely a timing issue. The government has had the final report since December, and the AMA said it is too much to ask health professionals and insurers – already overwhelmed with changes and delays during Covid – to implement the changes in less than a month. “There’s over 900 new items or changed items amongst the five and a half thousand MBS items that exist,” Khorshid said. “Some of the changes are around rules, changing the way that doctors use the items, not allowing doctors to use multiple items to describe one operation. So for surgeons who have been using the MBS, they have to decide what to do. “Do they accept a lower rebate on behalf of their patient and keep their fees the same? Or do they increase the fee that the patient can expect to pay, increase that gap because they want to keep their fees around the same as they were before? “Even worse, the rules and the descriptions around how to use the numbers haven’t even been released yet.” Wells, agreed: “The timing of the implementation is the issue.” “Surgeries would have already been scheduled with patients having an expectation about what it meant for them financially, which will now change,” she said. “There is merit in the AMA’s suggestion that there is a short delay to implementation so that doctors and patients can get ready. That would allow time for development of responses such as the content for new informed financial consent conversations.”","charCount":"7946","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/melissa-davey\">Melissa Davey</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2021/jun/08/liberal-senator-says-coalition-mps-shifting-to-support-indigenous-voice-to-parliament","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-08T01:59:35Z","webTitle":"Liberal senator says Coalition MPs shifting to support Indigenous voice to parliament","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/jun/08/liberal-senator-says-coalition-mps-shifting-to-support-indigenous-voice-to-parliament","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2021/jun/08/liberal-senator-says-coalition-mps-shifting-to-support-indigenous-voice-to-parliament","fields":{"headline":"Liberal senator says Coalition MPs shifting to support Indigenous voice to parliament","standfirst":"<p>Andrew Bragg’s views backed by NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian, who says Uluru statement contains ‘deeply liberal ideas’</p>","trailText":"Andrew Bragg’s views backed by NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian, who says Uluru statement contains ‘deeply liberal ideas’","byline":"Katharine Murphy Political editor","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"60e9ec96b229866388182e76f8f9d4a0b739f437\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60e9ec96b229866388182e76f8f9d4a0b739f437/0_371_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Liberal senator Andrew Bragg, front, says he believes Australians would support a legislated voice to parliament.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Liberal senator Andrew Bragg, left, wants colleagues to adopt the Uluru statement and says he believes Australians would support a legislated Indigenous voice to parliament. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lukas Coch/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Liberal senator Andrew Bragg says he believes Australians will support a legislated voice to parliament and an amendment to the constitution that obliges the commonwealth to ensure that Indigenous peoples are heard.</p> <p>Bragg – the backbencher <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2021/may/29/will-the-government-bring-an-indigenous-voice-to-parliament-australian-politics-podcast\">who is leading efforts to persuade colleagues</a> to adopt the Uluru statement – will use a speech to the Sydney Institute on Tuesday night to try and map a pathway through the Coalition’s internal differences.</p> <p>Bragg’s efforts have also been backed by the New South Wales premier, Gladys Berejiklian, who used remarks at a book launch earlier this week to argue the Uluru statement contains “deeply liberal ideals”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/may/26/uluru-statement-from-the-heart-awarded-2021-sydney-peace-prize\">Uluru Statement from the Heart awarded 2021 Sydney peace prize</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In endorsing Bragg’s campaign, Berejiklian also noted “a growing mood for change on the issue of reconciliation”.</p> <p>On Tuesday night, Bragg will tell the Sydney Institute the Coalition party room is becoming more supportive of change, particularly in the current generation of new parliamentarians.</p> <p>The Liberal senator will say that shift is encouraging, but the government also needs “to think about what the people will ultimately support”.</p> <p>“I believe that the Australian people will support the parliament establishing a voice and that they will support an amendment to the constitution that obliges the commonwealth to ensure that Indigenous peoples are heard,” Bragg will say.</p> <p>“I do not believe that the Australian people will support an amendment to the constitution, however, that is highly complex and explicitly creates a new entity in the constitution.”</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/uluru-statement-from-the-heart\">The Uluru statement</a> calls for the establishment of a “voice” to parliament that would be enshrined in the constitution.

Bragg – the backbencher who is leading efforts to persuade colleagues to adopt the Uluru statement – will use a speech to the Sydney Institute on Tuesday night to try and map a pathway through the Coalition’s internal differences. Bragg’s efforts have also been backed by the New South Wales premier, Gladys Berejiklian, who used remarks at a book launch earlier this week to argue the Uluru statement contains “deeply liberal ideals”. In endorsing Bragg’s campaign, Berejiklian also noted “a growing mood for change on the issue of reconciliation”. On Tuesday night, Bragg will tell the Sydney Institute the Coalition party room is becoming more supportive of change, particularly in the current generation of new parliamentarians. The Liberal senator will say that shift is encouraging, but the government also needs “to think about what the people will ultimately support”. “I believe that the Australian people will support the parliament establishing a voice and that they will support an amendment to the constitution that obliges the commonwealth to ensure that Indigenous peoples are heard,” Bragg will say. “I do not believe that the Australian people will support an amendment to the constitution, however, that is highly complex and explicitly creates a new entity in the constitution.” The Uluru statement calls for the establishment of a “voice” to parliament that would be enshrined in the constitution. A constitutionally enshrined “voice” cannot be abolished by the government of the day. Senior Coalition players have derided the concept, erroneously, as a third chamber of parliament but the minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt, has embarked on a co-design process for the “voice”. Under a proposal outlined in an interim report in January, the federal government would be obliged to consult the Indigenous voice to parliament when crafting laws on race, native title and racial discrimination that impact upon Aboriginal Australians. But the voice would have no power to overturn policy or prevent laws being passed. While Wyatt has been attempting to land a consensus position, the government has never fully endorsed constitutional enshrinement of the Uluru proposal, and has been tracking towards a legislated option. Wyatt has argued repeatedly the process should not be rushed because any proposal that ultimately failed at a referendum would set back the cause for many years. Bragg supports some form of constitutional change. He will say on Tuesday night Uluru calls for constitutional enshrinement and a “voice established in legislation as part of a package that includes a constitutional amendment that obliges the commonwealth to hear Indigenous peoples is a liberal way of delivering what Uluru calls for”. Addressing negative pushback from colleagues about the proposal, Bragg will say: “Putting an obligation on the commonwealth to consult doesn’t give a special deal to a minority, it provides a duty to consult which should have been there at the outset.” Bragg argues the Liberal party needs to lead this debate because the “party of patriots should … drive this agenda because it is a patriotic agenda”. “We cannot change the past but we need to make sure that the restlessness in Australia is concluded by delivering a national reconciliation worthy of a great nation,” Bragg will say on Tuesday night. “Until we do this we are denying our children their full and proper inheritance”. The Labor senator Pat Dodson has recently blasted the Morrison government for a lack of progress. “[Wyatt’s] got to lead, he’s supposed to be the leader in the First Nations space, it’s no good prancing around if you won’t lead on hard issues, and this is a hard issue,” Dodson told reporters in March. “He’s the bloke with responsibility, with the PM, and they should be leading and helping the nation to heal the wounds of the past divisions and discord, and taking us forward to build a better relationship.

The streamlined national set-up has the Olyroos under the same coaching staff as their senior counterparts, and the country’s young talent appear better prepared for it. “It was an opportunity to give young players a chance to show what they can do and I was very happy with the way the boys went,” Arnold said. “We created chances again. That’s the hardest thing. We had a very inexperienced team that was given an opportunity [with] only a couple of senior players around them, and I thought they handled everything really well. The most important thing is our patterns of play, and they were working. Sometimes it was the end pass, and that is what happens when you throw a new team together.” Still, Maclaren and Souttar made it five goals apiece in this stage of qualifying, ranking them equal fifth across the eight groups. Top is Liverpool’s Takumi Minamino, who took his tally to nine on Monday night in Japan’s 4-1 Group F win over Tajikistan. International teammate Yuya Osako is second overall with eight, including five in last week’s 10-0 rout of Myanmar which sealed the country’s place in the next phase of qualifying. Syria joined them overnight after beating Guam 3-0 in Group A, with lead striker Omar Al Somah (seven goals) in characteristically eye-cat Hajime Moriyasu’s Japan team have scored 41 goals from seven games, albeit in a less challenging group than, say, Group C, in which Iraq, Iran and Bahrain are in the running. In all, many of the usual suspects are in a strong position for a top-two finish. For Australia, there is still learning to be done in the next two games against Nepal and Jordan, and Arnold’s pre-game preach of ruthlessness will no doubt be reprised in the lead-up to Saturday and Tuesday. Duke alluded to as much in his post-match assessment that the performance “could have been a bit more polished”. But it was comfortable, and did not have to be anything else.","charCount":"4398","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/emma-kemp\">Emma Kemp</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"}]}}

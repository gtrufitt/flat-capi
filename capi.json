It also changes the rules of vote counting in ways that are not addressed by the federal legislation. It facilitates third-party challenges to the legitimacy of votes and arrogates to the state legislature, the General Assembly, the power to appoint most members of the state board of elections, who in turn have the power to replace county boards of elections. The legislature removed Georgia‚Äôs secretary of state from the State Election Board after the incumbent, Brad Raffensperger, refused to help Mr. Trump stake an illegitimate claim on the state‚Äôs electoral votes.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60ba84448f082ac930aea9aa\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-04T20:00:06.886Z\">9.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Earlier today Reuters reported that JPMorgan &amp; Chase is restarting its political giving with one stipulation: it won‚Äôt give to Republicans who voted to overturn the 2020 presidential election results. </p> <p>Here‚Äôs the Reuters <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/exclusive-jpmorgan-resumes-political-giving-freezes-out-republicans-who-2021-06-04/\">report</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/companies/JPM.N\">(JPM.N)</a> will resume making political donations to U.S. lawmakers but will not give to Republican members of Congress who voted to overturn President Joe Biden‚Äôs election victory, according to an internal memo on Friday seen by Reuters.</p> <p>The bank was among many corporations that paused political giving following the deadly Jan. 6 Capitol riots when supporters of former president Donald Trump tried to stop Congress from certifying the election.</p> <p>Just hours later, 147 Republicans, the vast majority of them in the House of Representatives, voted to overturn the Electoral College results which Trump falsely claimed were tainted by fraud.</p> <p>Following a review, the country‚Äôs largest lender will this month resume giving through its Political Action Committee (PAC) but will continue its freeze on donations to a ‚Äúhandful‚Äù of the 147 lawmakers whom it had previously supported, the bank said.</p> <p>The pause will last through the 2021-2022 election cycle, which includes November‚Äôs midterm elections, after which JPMorgan will review whether to resume contributions to the lawmakers concerned on an individual basis, it said.</p> <p>‚ÄúThis was a unique and historic moment when we believe the country needed our elected officials to put aside strongly held differences and demonstrate unity,‚Äù the bank wrote of the Jan. 6 vote to certify Biden‚Äôs win.</p> <p>JPMorgan noted that its PAC is an important tool for engaging in the political process in the United States.

The drawing, which took place on a makeshift stage backed by a sparkly gold curtain and giant gameshow wheel, is part of a $116.5m program designed to incentivize more Californians to get vaccinated. The state will give ten people $1.5m prizes and thirty people $50,000 prizes. An additional 2m people will receive $50 gift cards. Everyone who has received at least one shot is eligible for the drawings. Two-thirds of eligible Californians have received at least one dose of the vaccine, according to the AP. The state is hoping to increase the vaccination rate to 75%. Microsoft blocked its search engine, Bing, from returning image and video results for the phrase ‚Äútank man‚Äù ‚Äì a reference to the iconic image of a lone protestor facing down tanks during the 1989 protests in Tiananmen Square ‚Äì on Friday, the 32nd anniversary of the military crackdown. References to the pro-democracy protest movement have long been censored in the People‚Äôs Republic of China, where the government maintains strict control over the internet, but the Bing censorship extended to users outside China‚Äôs ‚Äúgreat firewall‚Äù, including the US. Results in Germany, Singapore, France, Switzerland and elsewhere were also blocked, according to Reuters and Vice News. The censorship came amid the PRC‚Äôs crackdown on Hong Kong, where it banned the Tiananmen Square anniversary vigil for the second year in a row, and growing concern over the extent to which China can exert economic pressure to enforce its censoriousness overseas. Just last week, American actor John Cena made a public apology for referring to Taiwan as ‚Äúa country‚Äù, an offense to the PRC which insists that Taiwan is not an independent state. US-based tech companies have long struggled to balance their desire to operate in China‚Äôs enormous market with the censorship demands of the government. In 2016, the New York Times reported that Facebook was working on a secret tool that would allow a third party to censor the platform for Chinese users in exchange for the PRC allowing Facebook to operate within the country. In 2018, employees at Google exposed an internal project to build a censored search engine that the company hoped would allow it to reenter China. Google had pulled out of China in 2010 over censorship and hacking. Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Guardian. A company spokesperson told Vice: ‚ÄúThis is due to an accidental human error and we are actively working to resolve this.‚Äù Hello everyone, this is Julia Carrie Wong in Oakland, California, picking up the live blog for the rest of the evening. Stay tuned for more news coming up... That‚Äôs it for me. I‚Äôm passing the blogging platform over my colleague Julia Carrie Wong. To reiterate here‚Äôs what happened today: The chairman of the Texas Republican Party, Allen West, has abruptly stepped down. Despite calls from Republicans for Anthony Fauci to step down, Joe Biden says his confidence in Fauci is unchanged. Vladimir Putin accused the United States of trying to gin up tensions with Russia over accusations of cyberhacking. Facebook said Donald Trump‚Äôs suspension on the platform will continue for at least two years. Jens Stoltenberg, the secretary general of NATO, will travel to Washington DC in June. A little more on those infrastructure negotiations. The White House sent out its own account of today‚Äôs call between Senator Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and Joe Biden. The key line here is that the White House said Capito and Republicans increased their counteroffer by about $50 billion. The Guardian‚Äôs ace voting rights reporter, Sam Levine, flags this editorial from the New York Times editorial board arguing that Democrats shouldn‚Äôt go so big on a voting rights bill. The argument from the Times comes as Joe Biden has dispatched vice-president Kamala Harris to lead his administration‚Äôs push to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the For The People Act through a stubbornly gridlocked Congress. Here‚Äôs more from the editorial: Because there is little chance the bill will pass in its current form, Democrats face a clear choice. They can wage what might be a symbolic (and likely doomed) fight for all the changes they would like. Or they can confront the acute crisis at hand by crafting a more focused bill, perhaps more palatable for more senators, that aims squarely at ensuring that Americans can cast votes and that those votes are counted. A new election law in Georgia highlights the shortcomings of H.R. 1. The Georgia law, passed in March, imposes a host of restrictions on voter registration and on voting, most of which would be reversed by the federal legislation. It also changes the rules of vote counting in ways that are not addressed by the federal legislation. It facilitates third-party challenges to the legitimacy of votes and arrogates to the state legislature, the General Assembly, the power to appoint most members of the state board of elections, who in turn have the power to replace county boards of elections. The legislature removed Georgia‚Äôs secretary of state from the State Election Board after the incumbent, Brad Raffensperger, refused to help Mr. Trump stake an illegitimate claim on the state‚Äôs electoral votes. Earlier today Reuters reported that JPMorgan &amp; Chase is restarting its political giving with one stipulation: it won‚Äôt give to Republicans who voted to overturn the 2020 presidential election results. Here‚Äôs the Reuters report: JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) will resume making political donations to U.S. lawmakers but will not give to Republican members of Congress who voted to overturn President Joe Biden‚Äôs election victory, according to an internal memo on Friday seen by Reuters. The bank was among many corporations that paused political giving following the deadly Jan. 6 Capitol riots when supporters of former president Donald Trump tried to stop Congress from certifying the election. Just hours later, 147 Republicans, the vast majority of them in the House of Representatives, voted to overturn the Electoral College results which Trump falsely claimed were tainted by fraud. Following a review, the country‚Äôs largest lender will this month resume giving through its Political Action Committee (PAC) but will continue its freeze on donations to a ‚Äúhandful‚Äù of the 147 lawmakers whom it had previously supported, the bank said. The pause will last through the 2021-2022 election cycle, which includes November‚Äôs midterm elections, after which JPMorgan will review whether to resume contributions to the lawmakers concerned on an individual basis, it said. ‚ÄúThis was a unique and historic moment when we believe the country needed our elected officials to put aside strongly held differences and demonstrate unity,‚Äù the bank wrote of the Jan. 6 vote to certify Biden‚Äôs win. JPMorgan noted that its PAC is an important tool for engaging in the political process in the United States. PACs are political committees organized for the purpose of raising cash to support or in some cases oppose election candidates. Meanwhile, CNBC‚Äôs Brian Schwartz got his hands on a memo from CitiGroup memo announcing a slightly different approach. We have a new readout of conversations between Senator Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, the lead Republican negotiator on an infrastructure deal, and Joe Biden. The statement is very brief, even for these usually anodyne readouts. Conspicuously, there‚Äôs no line saying that Capito is encouraged or any progress has been made (as there have been in other statements). On the other hand, the statement does say the two lawmakers will talk again on Monday so it‚Äôs not over yet. NATO‚Äôs secretary general will meet with Joe Biden here in Washington in early June. Donald Trump is fuming over Facebook‚Äôs announcement that he would be suspended from the social media platform for the next two years. My colleague Julie Carrie Wong has written a report on Facebook‚Äôs announcement: At the end of the suspension period, Facebook said, it would work with experts to assess the risk to public safety posed by reinstating Trump‚Äôs account. ‚ÄúWe will evaluate external factors, including instances of violence, restrictions on peaceful assembly and other markers of civil unrest,‚Äù Clegg wrote. ‚ÄúIf we determine that there is still a serious risk to public safety, we will extend the restriction for a set period of time and continue to re-evaluate until that risk has receded.‚Äù The White House media briefing is underway and press secretary Jen Psaki has reiterated that Joe Biden intends to raise the problems of cyber attacks on US entities with Vladimir Putin when he meets with the Russian president during his visit to the UK and the European Union later this month. Biden views increasingly frequent ransomware attacks to be a ‚Äúrising national security concern,‚Äù she said. Psaki just said: ‚ÄúWe want to move towards a more stable and predictable relationship with Russia‚Äù and pledged that Biden is ‚Äúnever one to hold back on areas where Russian action is hurting the US‚Äù. Recent cyber attacks, including ransomware hacks, on US government and commercial computer systems are not known to be run by the Russian government but are carried out by cyber criminal gangs that are based in Russia or Russian-controlled territories and are tolerated by the authorities in Moscow. ‚ÄúWe know that the ransomware threat is urgent,‚Äù Psaki said. Biden plans to confront Putin when he meets with him in Geneva on June 16. Biden is attending G7 talks in the UK followed by a NATO summit on the Continent. A little earlier, Psaki said Biden will raise a number of issues with Putin, such as human rights and Russian aggression at the Ukraine border. ‚ÄúHe also will raise cyber activity, malign activity, problematic activity, harmful activity that we‚Äôve seen take place. There is the Solar Winds hack but also the ransomware hacks that we‚Äôve talked about. ‚ÄúThe actions of criminal groups within a country, there is a responsibility on the leaders of that country to take action and there‚Äôs no doubt that President Biden will be addressing that directly in that conversation.‚Äù Psaki added that the increasing problem has prompted a ‚Äúrapid review‚Äù of cyber security that is underway by the US government. Donald Trump has responded to Facebook‚Äôs decision that his suspension from the social media platform will, initially, last for two years. And, in a parallel universe, the former US president mysteriously refers to some election somewhere with which this outlet is unfamiliar. The election we‚Äôre familiar with is this one: We‚Äôre waiting for a press briefing at the White House by Jen Psaki, but for the moment, let us bring you a summary of the main events so far today. Facebook has announced that Donald Trump will continue to be suspended from the social media platform for two years and will only be reinstated ‚Äúif conditions permit‚Äù. Russian president Vladimir Putin issued a warning today: ransomware hacking allegations from the United States are a deliberate attempt to provoke a confrontation between the US and Russia. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Christopher Wray, the director of the FBI, compared the recent spate of ransomware attacks to the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center. Joe Biden is continuing talks with the Republican side today in an attempt to win bipartisan agreement on key legislative pieces stuck in Congress. Facebook has announced that Donald Trump will continue to be suspended from the social media platform for two years and will only be reinstated ‚Äúif conditions permit‚Äù. Today‚Äôs decision comes just weeks after input from the Facebook oversight board ‚Äì an independent advisory committee of academics, media figures and former politicians ‚Äì who recommended in early May that Trump‚Äôs account not be reinstated. However the oversight board punted the ultimate decision on Trump‚Äôs fate back to Facebook itself, giving the company six months to make the final call. The former president has been suspended since January, following the deadly Capitol attack that saw a mob of Trump supporters storm Congress in an attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. The company suspended Trump‚Äôs Facebook and Instagram accounts over posts in which he appeared to praise the actions of the rioters, saying that his actions posed too great a risk to remain on the platform. Following the Capitol riot, Trump was suspended from several major tech platforms, including Twitter, YouTube and Snapchat. Twitter has since made its ban permanent. We‚Äôll bring you more reaction and developments but you can also follow the full story as it unfolds here. Here‚Äôs a link to the decision as issued by Facebook itself. And here‚Äôs the column from last month from former Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger, who is a member of the oversight board that upheld FB‚Äôs ban, #ICYMI. Russian president Vladimir Putin issued a warning Friday: hacking allegations from the United States are a deliberate attempt to provoke a confrontation with the United States, per Reuters: President Vladimir Putin said on Friday that hacking allegations which some have linked to Russia were an attempt to provoke a political dispute ahead of a summit with US President Joe Biden on June 16, Interfax news agency reported. He also said that he expected his summit with Biden, which is set to take place in Geneva, to be held in a positive atmosphere, though he anticipated no breakthrough. Tensions between the two countries have been simmering for some time. Recall that in April the Biden administration issued new sanctions against Russia over cyberespionage: The Biden administration on Thursday announced sanctions against Russia for its involvement in a recent major cyber espionage operation against the US, foreign influence operations around US elections and other concerns. As part of an executive order signed by President Biden, the administration through the Treasury Department will block US financial institutions from purchasing bonds from Russia‚Äôs Central Bank, National Wealth Fund or Ministry of Finance after June 14 and from lending funds to these institutions. The directive also leaves open the possibility for the administration to expand the sanctions on Russian sovereign debt. Additionally, the Biden administration is expelling 10 personnel from the Russian diplomatic mission in Washington, some of whom US officials say are representatives of Russian intelligence services. One of the more crucial policy points for Joe Biden during his trip to meet with G7 leaders will be over a global minimum tax CNN has more. CNN‚Äôs Julia Horowitz explained the dynamics: The Biden administration‚Äôs ambitious plan to overhaul the global tax system is about to face a crucial test. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen heads to a meeting of Group of Seven finance ministers in London on Friday and Saturday looking to build support from many of the world‚Äôs top economies ‚Äî an important step in the administration‚Äôs efforts to rewrite international tax rules and discourage American companies from booking earnings abroad. G7 finance ministers are expected to back the US plan during the summit, according to a Reuters report citing a US Treasury official. Washington‚Äôs proposal will likely get a full endorsement when G7 leaders including President Joe Biden gather in the United Kingdom next week, the news agency reported. Last month, the US Treasury proposed a global minimum tax of at least 15%, aiming to tackle an unwieldy international system rife with loopholes. Establishing a minimum rate could help discourage companies from shifting their profits to countries where they would pay less tax. More and more Republicans have been calling for Dr. Anthony Fauci‚Äôs resignation, citing a trove of emails recently released to the public. Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri released one such statement this morning. It‚Äôs unlikely Fauci will resign or that Joe Biden will ask for Fauci‚Äôs resignation though. He said today he still is ‚Äúvery confident‚Äù in the chief medical adviser to the president. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Christopher Wray, the director of the FBI, compared the recent spate of ransomware attacks to the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center. Here‚Äôs his comments in the Journal: FBI Director Christopher Wray said the agency is investigating about 100 different types of ransomware, many of which trace back to hackers in Russia, and compared the current spate of cyberattacks with the challenge posed by the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. ‚ÄúThere are a lot of parallels, there‚Äôs a lot of importance, and a lot of focus by us on disruption and prevention,‚Äù Mr. Wray said in an interview on Thursday. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a shared responsibility, not just across government agencies but across the private sector and even the average American.‚Äù Mr. Wray‚Äôs comments‚Äîamong his first publicly since two recent ransomware attacks gripped the U.S. meat and oil-and-gas industries‚Äîcome as senior Biden administration officials have characterized ransomware as an urgent national-security threat and said they are looking at ways to disrupt the criminal ecosystem that supports the booming industry. Each of the 100 different malicious software variants are responsible for multiple ransomware attacks in the U.S., Mr. Wray said. Cyberattacks are something the president plans to bring up when he meets with Russian president Vladimir Putin. Earlier this week Biden told reporters that his administration is looking ‚Äúclosely‚Äù at possibly retaliating against Russia over ransomware attacks. ‚ÄúResponsible states do not harbor ransomware criminals,‚Äù White House press secretary Jen Psaki said recently. The Texas Tribune throws out the possibility that Allen West could be gearing up to challenge incumbent governor Greg Abbott, a Republican. Here‚Äôs the Tribune: West has not ruled out challenging Gov. Greg Abbott, and he has also had tension recently with Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick. A former Florida congressman who moved to Texas several years ago, West took over the party last summer, unseating incumbent James Dickey. He quickly made a name for himself for his willingness to speak out against fellow Republicans, including Abbott, whose coronavirus response he criticized. West used the latest legislative session to push hard for the party‚Äôs eight legislative priorities, and he has spent recent days lamenting the lack of progress that lawmakers have to show on them. It‚Äôs important to note that Abbott is a popular politician in Texas and has recently touted Donald Trump‚Äôs endorsement. He also won his last gubernatorial election by 13 percentage points. Unseating Abbott would not be easy. The jobs report numbers out today were overall positive. My colleague Dominic Rushe has more: The US added 559,000 jobs in May as the coronavirus pandemic receded, shaking off fears of a substantial slowdown in hiring after April‚Äôs disappointing monthly report. The Bureau of Labor Statistics said Friday that the unemployment rate had fallen to 5.8% from 6.1% in April, still significantly higher than the 3.8% unemployment rate recorded in February 2020 before Covid 19 hit the US but less than half its 14.8% peak in April last year. The news comes one month after the labor department shocked economists by announcing the US had added just 266,000 new jobs in April ‚Äì far below the 1m gain that had been expected. April‚Äôs report led to sparring between the Biden administration and Republicans who claimed higher levels of unemployment benefits were keeping people from returning to work. There are signs of a strong rebound across the US economy. Worker filings for unemployment benefits have dropped by 35% since late April and fell to a pandemic low of 385,000 last week, the labor department said Thursday. Former congressman Allen West, the ex-Florida member of Congress-turned chairman of the Texas Republican Party, is stepping down from his post. He had been leading the Texas Republican Party for less than a year, a short tenure for a chairman to abruptly end. There seems to be some confusion about the timing of when his departure will go into effect. While the vice chair of the party tweeted that West is stepping down at 5pm. today the party‚Äôs communications director tweeted that West will keep his job until early July. Here‚Äôs a press release announcing West‚Äôs departure. Good morning readers, Daniel Strauss here. Let‚Äôs get started. Joe Biden continues to find a deal with Republicans and conservative members of the Democratic party elusive on the primary legislative initiative his administration is focusing on. Later today, Biden is meeting with Senator Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia. It‚Äôs the latest meeting between the president and the lead Republican negotiator over a major infrastructure funding package. Despite repeated counter offers by Capito and her team of Senate Republicans, the White House and Congress have not gotten close to a compromise. And that‚Äôs caused Biden and his top aides to warn that time is running out to come up with a bipartisan deal. But there are persistent fissures within the Democratic Party as well. In an interview with CNN, Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, the most conservative Democrat in the Senate caucus and the most outspoken conservative Democrat on Capitol Hill, warned that he‚Äôs not ready to give up on a bipartisan compromise. Per CNN: In an interview with CNN on Thursday, Manchin said bipartisan infrastructure talks should continue even as pressure builds for Democrats to move ahead without Republicans, and he dismissed calls to create a special carveout from the Senate‚Äôs filibuster rules to pass a voting overhaul bill along straight party lines, a key priority for Democrats that faces stiff opposition from GOP lawmakers. Manchin heads into a pivotal time for Congress where a number of key policy issues are on a razor‚Äôs edge in the Senate, giving the swing Democrat enormous sway over the future of the Biden agenda. At the centerpiece of that agenda is the infrastructure package that Biden and Republicans are furiously negotiating in a last-ditch attempt to cut a compromise, though they remain far apart.

Washington is pushing for the immediate removal of the taxes, and threatened on Wednesday to impose punitive tariffs on countries that keep them in place. However, sources close to the talks argued this would be difficult for the UK and EU nations to accept, as it would mean US tech giants such as Google paying less tax until the reforms are implemented ‚Äì which could take several years.","charCount":"3148","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/richard-partington\">Richard Partington</a> Economics correspondent"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2021/jun/04/sale-make-light-of-manu-tuilagis-absence-to-thrash-harlequins","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-04T20:44:09Z","webTitle":"Sale make light of Manu Tuilagi‚Äôs late withdrawal in rout of Harlequins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/jun/04/sale-make-light-of-manu-tuilagis-absence-to-thrash-harlequins","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2021/jun/04/sale-make-light-of-manu-tuilagis-absence-to-thrash-harlequins","fields":{"headline":"Sale make light of Manu Tuilagi‚Äôs late withdrawal in rout of Harlequins","standfirst":"<ul><li>Sale 45-12 Harlequins</li><li>England centre misses match as Covid precaution</li></ul>","trailText":"Sale took the absence of Manu Tuilagi in their stride in a seven-try thrashing of Harlequins","byline":"Gerard Meagher","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"11ecc18889d1ad56ba470585caca599d50590638\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11ecc18889d1ad56ba470585caca599d50590638/91_0_5048_3029/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bevan Rodd scores for Sale\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bevan Rodd touches down to score Sale‚Äôs suxth try.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Rogers/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Sale blitzed past Harlequins with a seven-try victory and the kind of relentless power performance that made you wonder just how many they might have scored had Manu Tuilagi not been a late withdrawal.</p> <p>The Sharks move into second place, above Exeter who they face next weekend, and are reaching the business end of the season in superb form.</p> <p>They remain in the hunt for a home play-off and on this evidence none of their semi-final rivals will fancy meeting them.

They‚Äôre Iberian rivals, two of the best teams in the world ‚Ä¶ and the two most recent winners of the European Championship. ¬°Esta encendido! Est√° ligado!</p> <p><strong>Portugal are the reigning champions of Europe.</strong> Euro 2016 was their first-ever major title, and since then they‚Äôve added the inaugural Nations League in 2019. The dam thus broken, there‚Äôs a fair chance they‚Äôll retain their title, their squad including Bruno Fernandes, Joao Cancelo, Ruben Dias, Diogo Jota, Andre Silva, and, to give him his full title, 36-Year-Old Cristiano Ronaldo.</p> <p><strong>If they manage it, they‚Äôll become only the second nation to keep hold of the </strong><strong><em>Coupe Henri Delaunay</em> ‚Ä¶ Spain being the first. </strong>The Euro 2008 and Euro 2012 winners are the joint most successful country in European Championship history, also having won in 1964; fellow three-time victors Germany pip them on countback, having more runners-up finishes to their name. Few would be too surprised if they reclaim their crown next month and make it four, with a squad filled with the likes of Aymeric Laporte, Jordi Alba, Pau Torres, Sergio Ramos, Cesar Azpilicueta, Thiago, Rodri, Adama Traore and Ferran Torres.</p> <p><strong>Other potential winners are available, but these are the two we‚Äôll be watching tonight.</strong> Their last meeting was a 0-0 friendly draw in Lisbon last October; let‚Äôs hope tonight‚Äôs game is a bit more like the one before that, the sparkling 3-3 draw in Sochi at the last World Cup.

Sid Lowe was there in person, and he‚Äôll be filing his report in a while, so keep them peeled for that. Thanks for reading this MBM. Nighty night! Pre-tournament friendlies are difficult to parse, especially with so many substitutions. One thing we can safely conclude, though, is that Spain would be dangerous if they had a dependable striker. To be fair, twas ever thus; even when they were raking in the trophies during the imperial phase of tiki-taka, they could be extremely frustrating up front. But tonight Alvaro Morata took this charming quirk to extremes, missing a couple of big chances before hitting the bar during injury time with the best one of all. The full-backs looked good, mind, while the keeper grew in confidence, and that midfield is as pretty as ever. Portugal meanwhile will be pleased with their defensive resolve, Cristiano Ronaldo and Bruno Fernandes combined sweetly, and Renato Sanches was a magnificent force of nature. Plenty of plus points for both teams, even if the goals didn‚Äôt flow. Not a good evening for Alvaro Morata, who really should have won this for Spain on more than one occasion. 90 min +3: A free kick for Portugal, 40 yards out. Fernandes wedges it down the middle to release Ronaldo, but he should have waited for the whistle. Take two is a non-event ... and that‚Äôs that. 90 min +1: Well, they should have! Gaya‚Äôs clearance up the left wing sends Morata clear! Easy as that! He‚Äôs onside, and one on one with Rui Patricio. He draws the keeper, and ... batters his shot off the crossbar! Another absurd miss! 90 min: There will be two added minutes. Can either of these Iberian rivals snatch it? 88 min: Koke curls the free kick towards the far post. Ferran Torres gets the vaguest flick towards the bottom right. Rui Patricio gets down well to parry clear. That‚Äôs a fine save, and it was a wonderful delivery from Koke, though Spain may wonder why one of their forwards didn‚Äôt make a stronger connection. Spain have been impotent in the final third this evening. 87 min: Gaya cuts in from the left and is sandwiched by Rafa Silva and Palhinha. Free kick, and a chance to load the Portuguese box. 86 min: The intensity drops alarmingly, much to the crowd‚Äôs displeasure. To be fair to both sides, the slew of substitutions can‚Äôt have helped. 84 min: It‚Äôs not clear how this has remained goalless. Both teams - Spain especially - have had their chances. Best not to peak before the tournament starts, huh. 82 min: ... and he‚Äôs immediately in the action, curling a long pass upfield from the left touchline and releasing Ronaldo down the middle! Ronaldo heads forward, but too strongly, and instead of striding towards goal, the ball sails through to Simon. 81 min: Nuno Mendes comes on for Guerreiro. 80 min: The other Llorente makes his way down the right but can‚Äôt quite find Morata at the near post. Then another wave of attack, and Gaya crosses dangerously from the left. Morata tries to poke home, but mistimes his run again. Spain have had their chances. 79 min: Laporte makes way for Diego Llorente. 77 min: Morata sashays down the inside-right channel and cuts back for Ferran Torres, who should score from the penalty spot but allows his unconvincing shot to be blocked by Semedo. 76 min: Ruiz makes way for Koke, while Moreno replaces Sarabia. A huge reception for Koke, Atletico‚Äôs title-winning captain. 74 min: The pace has certainly dropped. 72 min: Sarabia makes good down the left and whistles a low cross through the box. The hapless Morata had gone too early. A slightly better timed run, and that was a tap-in. 70 min: Jota and the excellent Sanches are replaced by Palhinha and Rafa Silva. 69 min: A free kick for Portugal out on the right. Fernandes takes, finding Ronaldo six yards out. Ronaldo leaps high but glances his header wide left. You‚Äôd expect him to score. 67 min: Ferran Torres glides in from the right and yanks a weak shot right. Things were opening up for him there; he should have done much better. 65 min: Simon‚Äôs footwork in the first half was nothing short of appalling; here it‚Äôs absolutely delightful, as Garcia gives him a hospital pass. With Ronaldo and Jota bearing down, he executes a perfect pullback, sending Jota off to the shops, and rolls clear. Proper bullfighting brilliance. Ol√©! 63 min: Spain make a triple change: Thiago, Busquets and Pau Torres off, Pedri, Rodri and Eric Garcia on. 61 min: One corner leads to another, which leads to nothing. 60 min: Now it‚Äôs Portugal‚Äôs turn to miss a sitter. Ronaldo takes on Llorente down the right, reaches the byline, and stands one up for Jota, whose header from six yards is deflected over. He should have buried that. 59 min: Portugal make a couple more changes. Carvalho and Bruno Fernandes come on for Pepe and Oliveira. Here‚Äôs Charles Antaki: ‚ÄúClassy stuff from Busquets, which prompts the question of the last 10+ years in the Spanish National team ‚Äì if not him, then who? Koke has been in and out of the team, Sa√∫l likewise.. if we have to get down to the Dani Ceballoses, alarm bells.‚Äù 58 min: Pepe tries to shepherd a long pass down the Spanish right out of play. Llorente doesn‚Äôt allow him to do so, stealing the ball and cutting back for Sarabia ... who scoops over an unguarded net from 12 yards! What a miss! 56 min: Spain continue to dominate possession, though haven‚Äôt created much, that Morata chance being a glowing exception. 54 min: Llorente rolls a lovely pass in from the right to tee up Morata, clear just inside the box. Morata aims for the bottom left. Fonte blocks. The ball pings back to Morata, who aims for the bottom right this time, but drags it hideously wide. He should have scored. A look of misery washes over his face. 52 min: Laporte deals with the resulting corner, heading clear. Much better, though the bar was low. 51 min: Laporte attempts a clearing volley with his right peg. A hysterical slice sails into the crowd behind. Predominantly left-footed, then. What a way that would have been to mark his international debut! 50 min: A bit of space for Morata down the inside-right channel, slipped through by Busquets. Morata bashes his shot straight at Rui Patricio. He should have made the keeper work harder, at the very least. 49 min: Morata glides down the right. Pepe again has his antenna on, and intercepts once more. The old boy‚Äôs having a good match so far. 47 min: Pepe blooters into touch. By the dugout, Spain boss Luis Enrique brings the high ball down with a silky touch, much to the delight of the paying punters. 46 min: Busquets shovels a lovely pass down the inside-left channel for Sarabia, who chests down as he cuts infield. Pepe is on hand, though, to intercept just when it looked as though Sarabia was through. Portugal get the second half underway. They‚Äôve made the first change of the evening, swapping Joao Felix for Sporting striker Pote, who is making his international debut. ‚ÄúThat tooth-brushing advert looks like an early David Lynch production,‚Äù writes Mary Waltz. ‚ÄúCreepy.‚Äù Yep, it was the first ad ever shown on British television, and it‚Äôs been non-linear narratives a-go-go ever since. The players aren‚Äôt the only ones who should do some pre-tournament prep. Ahead of the Euros, history buffs are advised to bone up on 60 years and 15 tournaments‚Äô worth of action with Euro Summits: The Story of the European Championship by Jonathan O‚ÄôBrien. Breezy yet comprehensive, fun but authoritative, think of it as a perfect companion piece for Cris Freddi‚Äôs famous Complete Book of the World Cup, and I can‚Äôt think of praise too much higher than that. Highly recommended. Just a few extra seconds of play, and that‚Äôs the end of an entertaining, occasionally feisty, first 45. 45 min: Sanchez tries to release Ronaldo down the left, but his pass is too heavy. Ronaldo tries to catch it, turning on the jets, but can‚Äôt quite reach it. He‚Äôs not completely out of juice yet. 44 min: The corner leads to nothing. 43 min: Busquets slides a crisp, first-time pass down the inside left. Ruiz steps into the box, drops a shoulder, and sees his low squirter deflected wide for a corner. 41 min: Sanches has been very impressive. He drives down the inside-right channel and thinks about shooting. He lays off to Ronaldo to his right. Ronaldo has a think himself, then pulls back for Semedo, who shows no such hesitancy, battering a wild effort miles over the bar. Ronaldo, hands on hips, wonders why he bothered. 40 min: Corner for Spain down the left. Ronaldo heads it clear. It‚Äôs been good fun, this. 39 min: Peseta for the thoughts of the deposed David de Gea. 37 min: Simon has not impressed so far. He‚Äôs already had the ball stuck past him, and was nearly closed down when faffing about with Busquets. Now here comes the worst of all. Gaya slides in to stop Sanches‚Äôs pass finding Ronaldo down the inside-right channel. The ball balloons into the air. Simon isn‚Äôt sure whether to catch or not, so opts to volley. His low hack smashes straight into Ronaldo and nearly whistles back past his lugs. He catches just in time. What a nonsense. 35 min: Now Sanches brings down Sarabia, and the crowd are baying for blood. There‚Äôs still no booking, though, and the referee gets this one absolutely right, Sanches having slipped over and accidentally cleaned his man out. 34 min: Sanches is very lucky to escape a booking as he clatters into Gaya. There might have been a couple of studs showing there, in fact. The referee makes do with a lecture. 33 min: Spain have been taking a few chances when playing out from the back. Simon and Busquets were nearly punished for over-elaborating a few minutes ago, some slapstick deemed worthy of a rerun on Spanish television. A lull, basically. 31 min: More of the pantomime booing, as Ronaldo takes possession of the ball. This is Atletico Madrid‚Äôs stadium, to be fair, he‚Äôll be expecting it. 29 min: That was a timely attack by Spain, though, because after a slow start, Portugal were beginning to work their way into the game. A reminder how quickly they can spring forward. 27 min: A huge chance for Spain, as Morata, with the outside of his left boot, curls from the left wing, the ball dropping towards Ferran Torres at the far post. Torres should score, Pepe having been completely bypassed, but flashes his header wide right from close range. 26 min: A free kick for Portugal, the best part of 30 yards out. It‚Äôs tapped to Ronaldo, who considers belting it goalwards, but instead embarks on a dribble down a cul-de-sac. What a waste. 24 min: It was the right decision, though. Fonte was all over Pau Torres, so much so that the defender didn‚Äôt need to make any theatrical additions ... but did so anyway. 23 min: Portugal win their first corner of the game ... or rather Ruiz gifts them it. It‚Äôs hit long from the left. Fonte rises, ten yards out, and sends an unstoppable looping header over Simon and into the top left! But the whistle immediately goes for a foul. Ronaldo is livid. 21 min: Sanches takes matters into his own hands, and embarks on an elegant skitter down the inside-right channel. He nearly works his way into the box, but throws one shape too many and Pau Torres is able to block and clear. 19 min: Spain continue to stroke it around attractively, and when they don‚Äôt have it, swarm their opponents with great determination. Portugal are struggling to retain possession, and a certain forward is doing quite a lot of frowning and pointing, having seen very little of the ball. 17 min: Sarabia‚Äôs pressing forces Semedo into the clumsy concession of a corner ... but the referee points for a goal kick. More pantomime booing. 16 min: Spain have enjoyed a nice neat 75 percent of possession so far. 14 min: Oliveira clatters into Morata, having just been robbed by Thiago, an unnecessarily fierce challenge that should bring censure, but doesn‚Äôt. A kick out on the follow through. Play goes on, and Spain force the first corner of the match. Nothing comes of it, but the hosts are well on top here. 12 min: And now the reigning European champions show a bit of flash, Jota coming in from the left and wedging to the far post. A cute and clever run, but the hosts clear their lines easily enough. 10 min: Sarabia drives in from the left and one-twos with Morata. He dinks towards Llorente, preparing to slam home, six yards out. Pepe somehow contorts his body to improvise a prodded clearance. That was lovely football from the three-time European champs. 9 min: Rui Patricio takes his own sweet time over a clearance, much to the pantomime annoyance of the crowd. 8 min: Spain have established control of this game quickly. Plenty of passes in the old-school style, some tiki here, a bit of taka there. Put it together, and they‚Äôre probing with purpose down both flanks. 6 min: Jota comes in from the left and is upended unceremoniously by his Liverpool team-mate Thiago. No favours here. 5 min: Torres looks lively. He spins infield from the right and glides into the Portugal box. Fonte sticks out a leg and puts a stop to his gallop with a well-time tackle. 3 min: A long pass down the Spanish right. Ferran Torres gets on the end of it, cutting back to ... nobody in particular. But that‚Äôs a promising start for the hosts, who found the Portuguese defence wide open. 2 min: It isn‚Äôt too long before Busquets comes sliding through Danilo. Welcome to the Wanda. Spain get the party started, in front of 20,000 fans. They‚Äôre back, baby! Spain are in their furious red, while Portugal sport second-choice teal. The teams are out. Apologies for the late arrival of this MBM, we had a few technical issues to iron out. Everything‚Äôs been switched off and back on again, and here we are. Hey, this sort of tardy foolishness is in the grand tradition; one of Granada TV‚Äôs first foray into live coverage missed the first four minutes of a European Cup semi featuring the Busby Babes. They had ads to show, and people needed that sweet, fresh hit of Gibbs SR. We‚Äôll be off in a minute or two. Spain: Simon, Marcos Llorente, Laporte, Pau Torres, Gaya, Thiago, Busquets, Fabian, Sarabia, Morata, Ferran Torres. Subs: de Gea, Azpilicueta, Diego Llorente, Koke, Gerard, Garcia, Rodri, Jordi Alba, Olmo, Oyarzabal, Gonzalez, Sanchez. Portugal: Rui Patricio, Nelson Semedo, Pepe, Fonte, Guerreiro, Sergio Oliveira, Danilo Pereira, Sanches, Ronaldo, Joao Felix, Jota. Subs: Lopes, Joao Moutinho, Andre Silva, Bruno Fernandes, William Carvalho, Rafa Silva, Neves, Goncalves, Nuno Mendes, Joao Palhinha, Rui Silva. Referee: Craig Pawson (Dear old Blighty). Welcome to some hot bonus MBM action, hand-crafted with precision tools to whet your appetite for the upcoming Euros. It‚Äôs a friendly between Spain and Portugal. They‚Äôre Iberian rivals, two of the best teams in the world ‚Ä¶ and the two most recent winners of the European Championship. ¬°Esta encendido! Est√° ligado! Portugal are the reigning champions of Europe. Euro 2016 was their first-ever major title, and since then they‚Äôve added the inaugural Nations League in 2019. The dam thus broken, there‚Äôs a fair chance they‚Äôll retain their title, their squad including Bruno Fernandes, Joao Cancelo, Ruben Dias, Diogo Jota, Andre Silva, and, to give him his full title, 36-Year-Old Cristiano Ronaldo. If they manage it, they‚Äôll become only the second nation to keep hold of the Coupe Henri Delaunay ‚Ä¶ Spain being the first. The Euro 2008 and Euro 2012 winners are the joint most successful country in European Championship history, also having won in 1964; fellow three-time victors Germany pip them on countback, having more runners-up finishes to their name. Few would be too surprised if they reclaim their crown next month and make it four, with a squad filled with the likes of Aymeric Laporte, Jordi Alba, Pau Torres, Sergio Ramos, Cesar Azpilicueta, Thiago, Rodri, Adama Traore and Ferran Torres. Other potential winners are available, but these are the two we‚Äôll be watching tonight. Their last meeting was a 0-0 friendly draw in Lisbon last October; let‚Äôs hope tonight‚Äôs game is a bit more like the one before that, the sparkling 3-3 draw in Sochi at the last World Cup. Kick off at Atletico Madrid‚Äôs Wanda Metropolitano is at 6.30pm BST, 7.30pm local.

The federal government, in the early stages of the rollout, said it would rely on private contractors to vaccinate 183,000 aged care residents and 339,000 staff, using in-reach teams that would attend each facility. But the government‚Äôs in-reach teams focussed overwhelmingly on vaccinating residents, and data this week showed just 32,833 staff ‚Äì less than 10% ‚Äì were given the jab by in-reach teams, largely using leftovers from residents in accordance with the government‚Äôs excess dose policy. The government‚Äôs panel of surge vaccination workforce providers ‚Äì Aspen Medical, Healthcare Australia, International SOS and Sonic Clinical Services ‚Äì have since given differing accounts on whether they were contracted to vaccinate staff. Earlier this week, the Age reported that Aspen Medical was never contracted to vaccinate staff, quoting a company spokesman. The company told the Guardian on Thursday that, in fact, it was contractually obliged to vaccinate staff. ‚ÄúAspen Medical has vaccination of aged care staff as part of its contractual obligations, and in that context has already vaccinated over 20,000 staff,‚Äù a spokesman said. Healthcare Australia initially told the Guardian it was ‚Äúcontracted to provide vaccinations for aged care residents only‚Äù. But it subsequently clarified it was ‚Äúcontracted to provide vaccinations to both the aged care residents and the workforce but was instructed by the department to prioritise the residents‚Äù. Sonic Clinical Services, brought on after Aspen and HCA, said it was not contracted to do staff vaccinations. ‚ÄúWe have not been contracted to provide in-reach vaccination services to Residential Age Care staff in Victoria (or elsewhere) and have not been involved in a tender process to do so,‚Äù chief executive, Dr Ged Foley, said. The fourth company, International SOS, refused to answer questions about what it was being paid by taxpayers to do, instead referring the Guardian to the health department. The health department said all four contractors were contracted to provide vaccine administration support ‚Äúfor registered residential aged care residents and workers across residential aged care facilities‚Äù. ‚ÄúSubsequent expert medical advice recommended against vaccinating aged care residents and workers at the same time based on overseas experience,‚Äù the department said. ‚ÄúIn response to the medical advice, the contracted providers were encouraged to focus on vaccinating residents as they are most vulnerable to the impacts of Covid-19.‚Äù Earlier this week, department associate secretary, Caroline Edwards, told Senate estimates that the four companies have shared in $76m worth of work. United Workers Union aged care director Carolyn Smith said the differing responses showed ‚Äúhow badly organised this process was‚Äù. ‚ÄúThis is just another level of confusion, where the contractors themselves don‚Äôt seem to know what they‚Äôve been contracted for and what they were supposed to be doing on the ground,‚Äù she told the Guardian. The government‚Äôs initial plan contemplated using the in-reach teams to vaccinate residents and aged care staff at the same time. But the government received advice that residents and staff should be done separately to avoid the prospect of having both groups sick from side-effects at the same time. Unions say the separate in-reach teams for aged care staff never showed up. Workers only got the vaccinations by taking residents‚Äô leftovers. The plan then shifted significantly. The government is now telling workers to get a vaccine wherever they can find one, either from GP clinics, state-run hubs, Commonwealth respiratory centres, or via dedicated aged care staff pop-up hubs. There were supposed to be 13 pop-up hubs established during May. There is only three, and they are all located in Sydney. On Friday, the government announced that in-principle agreement had been reached with states and territories to make the vaccination of workers mandatory. ‚ÄúAll of a sudden, the prime minister seems to be saying the problem with aged care vaccinations is hesitancy of aged care workers to have it,‚Äù Smith said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not the problem. The problem has been, really, they forgot that aged care workers existed or were important in this process.‚Äù Victoria and Queensland are also conducting targeted blitzes to give priority access to aged care workers. Queensland health minister Yvette D‚ÄôAth said the blitz meant others seeking a vaccine may be disappointed this weekend. ‚ÄúMy message to you is this ‚Äì you are likely to be waiting a very long time and you may not get a vaccine at all because we will prioritise those in this group,‚Äù she said on Friday. ‚ÄúWe will prioritise aged care workers, and then the 40-49 age group and those who are eligible and coming out on the weekend.‚Äù The federal government conceded this week it did not have complete data on aged care workers, but that a survey of major aged care providers suggested about 11% of staff had received a first dose. Even less were fully vaccinated. The health department said it had also engaged 50 roving teams in Victoria to vaccinate workers and residents in priority locations. It said it was discussing the worker vaccination plans further with the sector.","charCount":"5457","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/christopher-knaus\">Christopher Knaus</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}

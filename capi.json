million redevelopment of the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, reports AAP. <br></p> <p>Retired admiral <strong>Chris Barrie</strong> has been a vocal opponent of the major project, fearing it will completely undermine the national institution.<br></p> <p>On Tuesday he told ABC radio:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I guess the game is over in terms of the fact it is going to happen, but I’m afraid it won’t be a memorial for very much longe...</p> <p>It might be a place of entertainment but in my view it will not be the place of remembrance that I grew up with.</p> </blockquote> <p>Barrie said the redevelopment would turn the memorial into a theme park.<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I recall the place of remembrance that I used to take visitors to as being unique around the world...</p> <p>To try and turn it into a theme park or a place of entertainment, whatever words we want to use, is not right.</p> </blockquote> <p>Barrie said he is most concerned that in the pursuit of a “bigger and better” attraction, future generations of Australians will lose the opportunity to quietly reflect on the country’s military history.</p> <p>The National Capital Authority has given the nod for early works at the memorial, including the demolition of Anzac Hall.<br></p> <p>At least 140 trees will be removed as part of the redevelopment, which will eventually be replaced by 250 native trees.<br></p> <p>The NCA, which has published a 1200-page consultation report, received 601 submissions during its consultation process, of which just three were in support.<br></p> <p>Key concerns were the need for the expansion, tree removal, the impacts on heritage values and the cost.<br></p> <p>The memorial argues the project will address constraints to the existing use of the building, improve the overall visitor and veterans’ experience and maintain its significance as a national cultural institution.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60bea0ca8f0837b8708e0912\"

(They weren’t) The daily numbers are out and it seems there are two new locally acquired cases. A former defence chief has blasted the approval of a $500 million redevelopment of the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, reports AAP. Retired admiral Chris Barrie has been a vocal opponent of the major project, fearing it will completely undermine the national institution. On Tuesday he told ABC radio: I guess the game is over in terms of the fact it is going to happen, but I’m afraid it won’t be a memorial for very much longe... It might be a place of entertainment but in my view it will not be the place of remembrance that I grew up with. Barrie said the redevelopment would turn the memorial into a theme park. I recall the place of remembrance that I used to take visitors to as being unique around the world... To try and turn it into a theme park or a place of entertainment, whatever words we want to use, is not right. Barrie said he is most concerned that in the pursuit of a “bigger and better” attraction, future generations of Australians will lose the opportunity to quietly reflect on the country’s military history. The National Capital Authority has given the nod for early works at the memorial, including the demolition of Anzac Hall. At least 140 trees will be removed as part of the redevelopment, which will eventually be replaced by 250 native trees. The NCA, which has published a 1200-page consultation report, received 601 submissions during its consultation process, of which just three were in support. Key concerns were the need for the expansion, tree removal, the impacts on heritage values and the cost. The memorial argues the project will address constraints to the existing use of the building, improve the overall visitor and veterans’ experience and maintain its significance as a national cultural institution. Up to 30% of residents in some aged care homes have not taken up a Covid-19 vaccination, according to new data that has prompted an investigation into the high rates of non-uptake. Council on the Ageing chief executive Ian Yates said the most recent data shared with stakeholders was collated last week and showed most homes reported a refusal rate of between 5% and 15%. The data does not reveal why residents had declined the vaccine, but Yates said doctors would not have recommended it for a significant number due to underlying health conditions. The federal government was now focusing on homes with the highest levels of non-uptake to uncover why so many residents had chosen not to get vaccinated against Covid-19, he said. The minister for senior Australians and aged care services, Richard Colbeck, said: The department of health is examining overall consent data to review instances where consent rates are significantly low as part of planning for any required follow up activity with these facilities. But he said aged care facilities are responsible for supporting and obtaining residents’ consent to receive both doses of the vaccine. This includes early discussions on consent, including engagement with family and guardians, and treating general practitioners, as required. I’m sorry, I’m still laughing at the idea that Daniel Andrews would have been filming himself when he slipped on the steps. That’s wild. Coronavirus vaccines are being made available to all National Disability Insurance Scheme participants aged over 16, reports Daniel McCulloch from AAP. National cabinet has approved the rapid expansion to speed up the sluggish vaccine rollout across the vulnerable disability sector. It comes after dedicated vaccination hubs for people with disabilities, support workers and primary carers were given the green light. The disability minister, Linda Reynolds, made a statement this morning: We are working quickly to provide more locations for people to receive their vaccination in safe, accessible settings ... It is a particularly important step forward that both paid and unpaid carers of NDIS participants are now able to get the vaccination as soon as possible. The number of vaccinated NDIS participants is slowly growing. Almost 40,500 NDIS participants (16%) have received at least one dose of the vaccine. More than 7,800 NDIS participants living in group homes and aged care settings – 28% of the population – have been given at least one jab. However, people in disability care were considered the highest priority group and the vaccine rollout is still months behind schedule. Now, this fairly bold move by the Victorian opposition hasn’t gone unnoticed by the state government. Treasurer Tim Pallas has called for them to make a public apology and labelled the theories “QAnon craziness”: This is nonsense ... we know it’s nonsense. What happened to Daniel Andrews was an unfortunate but very serious spinal injury. There’s nothing more to it ... Perhaps they [the Liberals] need to issue a public apology. Oh, and by the way, the leader of the Victorian opposition, Michael O’Brien, is also involved: Yikes, some weird stuff is going on in the Victoria parliament this morning. So the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has been off for a number of months now after falling on some wet steps and fracturing his spine. Since this happened a number of conspiracy theories have been bubbling away. But now it seems the state opposition is willing to play into these bizarre rumours publicly. Here is what the shadow treasurer, Louise Staley, had to say at a press conference this morning: Nobody’s got footage of the stairs. Nobody’s got really any idea where it happened and this is a very visual world these days where we seem to have everything out there on the media but not this. (I know personally I often film myself getting ready for work. If you’re lucky I’ll release the video of me making a cup of tea at 6.45am.) When asked by AAP reporter Benita Kolovos why she was “fuelling conspiracy theories”, Staley said: Well, the easiest way to stop any of these conspiracy theories – which I’m not playing into – is for these questions to be answered. Just staying on that ABC radio interview with Nationals MP Matt Canavan for a moment. He has been asked his views on the Biloela family’s situation, saying he believes the multimillion-dollar effort to keep the family in detention is worth it to protect Australia’s borders: I think what is “worth it” is that we do have strong border protections in this country that has made sure that we don’t have the atrocious and tragic trade of people that we saw around 10 years ago ... Of all of the courts, none have found that this family has refugee status. Therefore, they do not have a right to stay in this country. Now, they have chosen with their lawyers to fight and contest that. Now that’s their right, but of course, that leaves them ... in a place of limbo, if you like ... It’s certainly tragic what’s happened here to this young girl, but, given they have been found not to have refugee status ... they really cannot stay in this country. But they also have rights here, because we are a country of rights and laws of rights to challenge and contest that, but that does take time. NSW nationals MP Matt Canavan has labelled the idea of vaccine passports “un-Australian” after the former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull said on Monday that the government should seriously consider them. The passport proposal suggests certain activities, most centrally international travel, would require proof of vaccination, but Canavan told ABC Radio this morning that this went against Australian’s human rights: The idea that [being] free to go to the movies to travel to other states of Australia is somehow a gift to be given from the government is absolutely the wrong way around. In this free and fair country that we have, we have those freedoms, they are ours, they’re not given to us or gifted to us by the governance I say, they’re rights at birth as Australian citizens. They should never or only very rarely be restricted. And I don’t see any reason why at this stage we need to introduce vaccine passports. I’m confident that we will get to a high level of vaccinations as we do with other vaccines in this country, and then we’ll be able to get on with their lives. Not everyone will be vaccinated, but it will probably cover almost all vulnerable people. A former Bunnings Warehouse on the NSW north coast will be converted over the next six weeks into the state’s second Covid-19 vaccination hub. The centre, at Belmont in Lake Macquarie, is expected to be ready to administer up to 20,000 jabs a week from mid-July. The hub is the second for NSW, which already has a centre at Homebush in Sydney’s west delivering up to 5,000 injections a day, reports AAP. Premier Gladys Berejiklian made the announcement in a statement this morning: We are planning to replicate that model in the Hunter region, so we can quickly and safely vaccinate as many people as possible across NSW. The Lake Macquarie centre will employ up to 100 nurses, 25 pharmacists or pharmacy technicians plus about 200 other support staff. About 150 people will be hard at work converting the former Bunnings site over the next six weeks before it opens to residents in the region. The centre will administer both the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines, with bookings required. Labor Senator Kristina Keneally, who visited the Biloela family on Christmas Island this year, has fronted media this morning calling on the government to “bring them home”. She spoke to ABC News Breakfast just before: The family’s lawyers have put information in front of the minister about [older daughter] Kopika and Tharnicaa’s ongoing physical and mental health impacts of detention. And this latest emergency – this acute medical emergency – is unfortunately just a most recent example of the ongoing impacts that detention is having on these two little Australian-born girls. Today, I say to the minister for home affairs, and the minister for immigration, it’s time to bring this sorry saga, what we as a country are doing to these two little Australian-born girls to an end. Bring them home to Biloela, a town who wants and loves them. Keneally said the whole family should have been allowed to travel with the three-year-old on the medevac flight, rather than just her mother, Priya: All of this heartbreak for this family. The last thing they need right now is to be separated from one another and the last thing of course is this little girl, Tharnicaa, needs, is this type of medical emergency. Just back on the Biloela family, there is some controversy about the level of medical care three-year-old Tharnicaa may have received. Advocates for the family are alleging the detention centre staff didn’t take Tharnicaa to the hospital on Christmas Island until Sunday, despite multiple requests from her mother. A spokesperson for the Department of Home Affairs said both the department and Australian Border Force were committed to the welfare of detainees in immigration detention: Healthcare services for detainees on Christmas Island are broadly comparable with those available within the Australian community under the Australian public health system ... The ABF facilitates access to nurses, doctors and specialists for all members of the family. Good morning all, It’s Matilda Boseley here, ready to dive into this very lovely Tuesday with you. First up, it’s worth talking about what’s happening to the Biloela family, the Tamil family of four being held in immigration detention on Christmas Island. The youngest daughter, three-year-old Tharnicaa, has been medically evacuated to Perth with a suspected blood infection, renewing calls from advocates for the government to let the family return to their home in rural Queensland. A medical evacuation flight carrying Tharnicaa and her mother Priya landed at Perth airport on Monday evening, advocates for the family confirmed. They say Tharnicaa had been unwell for 10 days and might have septicaemia, experienced vomiting, diarrhoea, dizziness and a temperature of more than 40 degrees. Her mum Priya has released a short statement about the situation: I am feeling very scared and worried for my little girl ... She has been sick for many days, it took a long time for her to get to the hospital. She is already asking for her papa, it is going to be very hard being away from her Dad and sister. It is very hard for our family to be separated when our daughter is sick. Back in Victoria, the state is entering its 12th day of lockdown (I type from lockdown), and all eyes are on today’s numbers. Yesterday people were alarmed to see the state record 11 new locally acquired cases on Monday, fearing this would almost guarantee a third week of “stay-at-home orders”, but it was quickly clarified in the daily press conference that new cases are all close contacts of existing cases or people who are in quarantine, and there weren’t even any fresh exposure sites relating to these cases. We usually get word on the daily number before 9am, so I’ll keep you in the loop.

The British Retail Consortium said total sales increased by 10% in May compared with the same month in 2019, before Covid-19 hit consumer spending and tipped the UK into recession. After the reopening of non-essential retail and hospitality venues across all four nations of the UK, pent-up demand among lockdown consumers fuelled a sharp rise in spending, with strong growth in furniture sales and homewares, as well as a recovery in clothing and footwear shops. Clothes shops reported sales growth of more than 100% as going out returned with the opening of indoor hospitality in May. Following the reopening of physical shops, online sales growth fell back to 39% in May compared with a three-month average of 64%. However, it remains significantly higher than pre-pandemic growth of 1.5% in May 2019.

Pent-up demand for the in-store shopping experience, as well as the first signs of summer weather, helped retail to the strongest sales growth of the pandemic.” Separate figures from Barclaycard showed that spending was up by 7.6% on May 2019’s figure – the highest increase recorded since the first coronavirus restrictions were put in place last spring. Spending on essential items was bolstered by face-to-face purchases at food and drink specialists, where cardholders paid out 69% more than in May 2019. Barclaycard, which accounts for nearly half of the country’s debit and credit card transactions, said this spending may have been buoyed up by people preparing to host friends and family after the lockdown ends. Since 17 May, people in England, Wales and most of Scotland have been allowed to host another household indoors, or meet in a group of up to 30 outside, and pubs and restaurants have been able to cater for customers inside. Non-essential retail reopened across the UK in April. The Barclaycard data included signs of recovery at hospitality venues, although spending remained well below that recorded two years ago. The value of transactions in restaurants was 53% lower than in May 2019, up from a 74% decline in April, and in pubs and bars spending was down by 19%, up from a 67% dip the previous month.

As friends and families reunited after months apart, it is reassuring to see signs of recovery for the entertainment and hospitality industries, both of which have faced significant challenges over the past year.” The figures are part of a growing picture of an economy bouncing back as lockdown restrictions are eased. In early May, the Bank of England increased its estimate for UK GDP growth in 2021 from 5% to 7.25%, which would be the strongest growth since the second world war. Last week, UK factories reported surging orders, and on Monday the latest figures from the housing market showed almost double-digit growth in the year to May. Separate figures from the retail data firm Springboard showed a near-12% rise in high street visits last week, as the half-term break and good weather encouraged people to hit high streets and shopping centres. The company said footfall on UK high streets was up by 17% on the previous week, while shopping centres recorded a 9% uplift. Retail parks saw lower growth, with footfall up by 2%. Activity leapt by 37% in coastal towns as the holiday season got into swing, while in historic towns, footfall was up by a quarter week on week. Springboard’s data showed that across most parts of the country footfall was still down on the same period of 2019, but the gap narrowed to its lowest level since the pandemic hit. In central London, it was down by nearly 40%, while in coastal towns it was up by 10%, as a result of the bank holiday falling in a different week. Diane Wehrle, insights director at Springboard, said a combination of the bank holiday, good weather and the school break had “a hugely beneficial effect on customer activity”. She said: “Inevitably, visitors wanted to be outside to enjoy the weather, so by far the greatest benefit was seen by high streets, where the rise in footfall from the week before was double that in shopping centres, and eight times that in retail parks.”","charCount":"4668","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/hilaryosborne\">Hilary Osborne</a> and <a href=\"profile/richard-partington\">Richard Partington</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"law/2021/jun/08/powerful-new-watchdog-will-target-unscrupulous-employers-says-no-10","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-07T23:01:05Z","webTitle":" ‘Powerful’ new watchdog will target unscrupulous employers, says No 10","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2021/jun/08/powerful-new-watchdog-will-target-unscrupulous-employers-says-no-10","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/law/2021/jun/08/powerful-new-watchdog-will-target-unscrupulous-employers-says-no-10","fields":{"headline":" ‘Powerful’ new watchdog will target unscrupulous employers, says No 10","standfirst":"<p>Government claims body will enforce minimum wage and tackle modern slavery, but critics brand proposals ‘light on action’</p>","trailText":"Government claims body will enforce minimum wage and tackle modern slavery, but critics brand proposals ‘light on action’","byline":"Patrick Butler Social policy editor","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5c4ad3cd2036e8c7a604a222ce1fe62bd59eaba7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c4ad3cd2036e8c7a604a222ce1fe62bd59eaba7/0_182_5455_3273/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman using a sewing machine in a factory\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The government said it would also ‘explore further measures’ to target abuses in the garment sector specifically.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Dodge/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>A “powerful new watchdog” is to be created to tackle abuse by unscrupulous employers and name and shame big brands that turn a blind eye to exploitation of workers by their suppliers, the government has said.</p> <p>However, the Labour party and the Trades Union Congress (TUC) criticised the “heavy on spin but light on action” proposals, saying the body would do little to change the insecure working conditions faced by many and highlighting that there was no timetable for its introduction.</p> <p>The proposed watchdog would enforce the minimum wage, protect vulnerable workers’ holiday and sick pay entitlements, be responsible for tackling modern slavery, and name and fine companies which fail to pay workers what they are owed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2021/may/27/recruiters-urged-to-clamp-down-on-exploitation-via-umbrella-companies\">Recruiters urged to clamp down on exploitation via ‘umbrella companies’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The body would bring together three existing agencies into one enforcement body: the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority, the Employment Agency Standards Inspectorate and HMRC’s National Minimum Wage Enforcement.</p> <p>However, the government admitted the creation of the new body would require primary legislation, putting it at the mercy of the parliamentary timetable, which suggests it would be unlikely to be up and running in the near future.</p> <p>There was widespread shock last year over revelations of dangerous and exploitative workplace conditions in factories in Leicester, where staff were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/jan/23/national-shame-mp-sounds-alarm-over-uk-fast-fashion-factories\">allegedly paid as little as £3 an hour</a> and reportedly forced to work making garments for national brands, despite having Covid.</p> <p>The government said it would “explore further measures” to target abuses in the garment sector specifically, including the creation of a Garment Trade Adjudicator to investigate company supply chains.

However, the Labour party and the Trades Union Congress (TUC) criticised the “heavy on spin but light on action” proposals, saying the body would do little to change the insecure working conditions faced by many and highlighting that there was no timetable for its introduction. The proposed watchdog would enforce the minimum wage, protect vulnerable workers’ holiday and sick pay entitlements, be responsible for tackling modern slavery, and name and fine companies which fail to pay workers what they are owed. The body would bring together three existing agencies into one enforcement body: the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority, the Employment Agency Standards Inspectorate and HMRC’s National Minimum Wage Enforcement. However, the government admitted the creation of the new body would require primary legislation, putting it at the mercy of the parliamentary timetable, which suggests it would be unlikely to be up and running in the near future. There was widespread shock last year over revelations of dangerous and exploitative workplace conditions in factories in Leicester, where staff were allegedly paid as little as £3 an hour and reportedly forced to work making garments for national brands, despite having Covid. The government said it would “explore further measures” to target abuses in the garment sector specifically, including the creation of a Garment Trade Adjudicator to investigate company supply chains. It would also consider extending the licensing system for businesses that supply agricultural workers. The announcement of the new watchdog comes just weeks after a long-promised employment bill – supposedly designed to allay fears about a dilution of worker’s rights following Brexit – was omitted from the government’s Queen’s speech legislative agenda. The business minister, Paul Scully, said: “The UK has a strong record when it comes to protecting and strengthening workers’ rights, and we want to reinforce that with a watchdog that has teeth.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) has recommended enzalutamide as an option for treating some types of prostate cancer. A spokesperson for Prostate Cancer UK said: “Enzulatamide will be made permanently available for men in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, while men in Scotland will have access to a similar treatment called abiraterone.” Experts welcomed the move which they said would be especially beneficial to those who cannot have chemotherapy. Enzalutamide, which patients can take at home without intravenous medication or a medical setting, is one of the “Covid-friendly” cancer drugs adopted by NHS England during the pandemic as “swaps” for existing drugs because they are less likely to damage the immune system or cause hospital visits. However, the new draft guidance from Nice is expected to open access to the drug – also known as Xtandi and made by Astellas Pharma – for broader use among an estimated 8,500 men. The drug can be used with androgen deprivation therapy as an option for treating hormone-sensitive metastatic prostate cancer in adults, according to the guidance. It works by blocking the impact of testosterone on prostate cancer cells. Without the hormone, the cells cannot grow – even if they have spread to other parts of the body. Clinical trials have found that the treatment slows the worsening of the disease and extends patients’ lifespans. Prof Peter Johnson, the clinical director for cancer for the NHS in England, hailed the drug’s approval as “one of the lasting legacies of the NHS’s response to the pandemic” which in the future he said would benefit thousands more people. He said: “Previously made available as part of the NHS’s package of ‘Covid-friendly’ cancer treatments, this life-extending drug is the latest that the NHS will now offer permanently to patients with hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. “Throughout the last year, the NHS has been offering people with cancer treatment options that are not only effective but safer and more convenient for use during the pandemic, allowing many to take medication at home or be given medicines with less harmful effects on their immune system.” Angela Culhane, the chief executive at Prostate Cancer UK, said: “This is fantastic news for thousands of men with advanced prostate cancer, especially those who have additional illnesses that make them unsuitable for chemotherapy. “It finally guarantees them access to a treatment which is just as effective as chemotherapy and can give them back precious time with their families.”","charCount":"2684","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/miranda-bryant\">Miranda Bryant</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2021/jun/08/uk-electoral-officials-announce-biggest-shake-up-of-boundaries-in-decades","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-07T23:01:04Z","webTitle":"UK electoral officials announce biggest shake-up of boundaries in decades","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/jun/08/uk-electoral-officials-announce-biggest-shake-up-of-boundaries-in-decades","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2021/jun/08/uk-electoral-officials-announce-biggest-shake-up-of-boundaries-in-decades","fields":{"headline":"UK electoral officials announce biggest shake-up of boundaries in decades","standfirst":"<p>Labour leader among those affected by changes, which will increase the number of English constituencies at the expense of Scotland and Wales</p>","trailText":"Labour leader among those affected by changes, which will increase the number of English constituencies at the expense of Scotland and Wales","byline":"Peter Walker and Aubrey Allegretti","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c8fa654cba70d937a73d762336b697fecd840443\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8fa654cba70d937a73d762336b697fecd840443/272_331_3935_2361/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Polling station\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A voter enters a polling station in west London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Electoral officials have announced plans for the biggest shake-up of parliamentary constituencies in England in decades, one that critics immediately warned would break up many recognisable communities because of an overly strict set of rules.</p> <p>Among those affected would be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/keir-starmer\">Keir Starmer</a>.

Among those affected would be Keir Starmer. The initial plan for the Labour leader’s London seat of Holborn and St Pancras would see it significantly rejigged and renamed as Kentish Town and Bloomsbury. Other recommendations by the Boundary Commission for England include the break-up of several longstanding, geographical-based seats, for example the Labour-held City of Chester, which has existed in various forms since the 16th century. Other well-known constituency names would also change or disappear. The existing Cities of London and Westminster seat, which includes Downing Street and parliament, would be split to become City of London and Islington south, and another new constituency, Westminster and Chelsea east. The plans are the latest stage in a marathon effort to update constituency boundaries that has been going on for a decade and which will see considerably more wrangling before the new map is theoretically finished in 2023. The rejig is a UK-wide operation, but each nation has its own Boundary Commission, and those for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are not due to report until at least next month. The aim of the exercise is to make every constituency’s population of registered voters close to the average of just under 73,400, apart from a handful of “protected” seats. One of the main objections from Labour is that the various Boundary Commissions have been given a leeway of just 5% above or below the average, rather than the 10% the party hoped for. One Labour MP said this restriction had inevitably led to anomalous and arbitrary constituency divisions: “The numbers have primacy. If everything has to be so equal, it can’t take account of geography. And with a constituency system, people have to have a sense of belonging for it to work.” Even the broad template involves significant flux, given considerable existing differences in constituency size, and varying changes in population since the last completed review, which took place between 2000 and 2007 and came into force in 2010. Keeping the current total of 650 seats, the number in England will rise from 533 to 543, Scotland will lose two, down to 57, and Wales will plummet from 40 to 32. Northern Ireland will stay at 18. Within England, population patterns also mean big changes. The south-east of England gains seven new seats, London two, the east of England three, and the south-west also three. In contrast, there will be a drop of two in the north-east, north-west and West Midlands, and one fewer in the east Midlands, with no change in Yorkshire and the Humber. One of the paradoxes of the changes is that while one analysis calculated they could benefit the Conservatives by up to 10 seats according to 2019 voting patterns, the recent Tory advance into the north and Midlands means a number of their MPs could still lose out. The detailed regional reports published for England set out the scale of the task in having to adapt to the extent of the changes and the tight restrictions on numbers. The outline for London notes that of the 73 London constituencies, only two would emerge the same as before, while “significant change is required throughout most of London in order to comply with the permitted electorate range”. In the north-west, more than 80% of constituencies face change beyond alignment with new local government ward boundaries, with a similar proportion in the south-east and east of England. This is, however, just the start of the process. The Boundary Commission will now embark on a series of consultations, which will see numerous local constituency parties and councils lobby for changes. The process is never straightforward, and the last two efforts were abandoned in disarray, in 2013 and 2018, when the plan had been to reduce the Commons to 600 seats. The review is “a crucial democratic step, and Labour will engage fully and constructively in the consultation”, said Cat Smith, Labour’s shadow cabinet office minister – whose own Lancaster and Fleetwood constituency is due to become just Lancaster and, according to the commission, “significantly different”. She added: “But the Conservative government’s one-size-fits-all approach to the exact size of constituencies has made the Boundary Commission’s work much harder, and will inevitably lead to the break-up of historic community ties across the UK.”","charCount":"4600","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/peterwalker\">Peter Walker</a> and <a href=\"profile/aubrey-allegretti\">Aubrey Allegretti</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/cryptic/28466","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-07T23:00:04Z","webTitle":"Cryptic crossword No 28,466","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/28466","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/cryptic/28466","fields":{"headline":"Cryptic crossword No 28,466","trailText":"Cryptic crossword No 28,466","byline":"Nutmeg","main":"","body":"","wordcount":"0","commentCloseDate":"2021-06-10T23:00:04Z","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2021-06-07T23:00:04Z","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2021-06-07T23:00:53Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2021-06-08T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/p/hkc2f","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","isLive":"true","bodyText":"","charCount":"0","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/nutmeg\">Nutmeg</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"australia-news/2021/jun/08/australia-urged-to-take-control-of-cocos-cc-internet-domain-to-foil-scammers-and-child-abuse-sites","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-07T22:47:49Z","webTitle":"Australia urged to take control of Cocos .cc internet domain to foil scammers and child abuse sites","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/jun/08/australia-urged-to-take-control-of-cocos-cc-internet-domain-to-foil-scammers-and-child-abuse-sites","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2021/jun/08/australia-urged-to-take-control-of-cocos-cc-internet-domain-to-foil-scammers-and-child-abuse-sites","fields":{"headline":"Australia urged to take control of Cocos .cc internet domain to foil scammers and child abuse sites","standfirst":"<p>Cocos (Keeling) Islands suffix is one of the most commonly used top-level domains for hosting child abuse material, researchers say</p>","trailText":"Cocos (Keeling) Islands suffix is one of the most commonly used top-level domains for hosting child abuse material, researchers say","byline":"Josh Taylor","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c66c25e35b990eb4e3c78ac23440977906e0cfb6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c66c25e35b990eb4e3c78ac23440977906e0cfb6/0_0_5506_3304/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Palm trees on Cocos Keeling Atoll\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A beach in Australia’s Cocos (Keeling) Islands territory, whose .cc internet domain is being used by sites hosting child abuse material and spam.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Uwe Moser/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>The .cc internet domain for the Cocos (Keeling) Islands should be claimed by the Australian government to stop it being abused by scammers and people hosting child abuse websites, Australian National University researchers have said.</p> <p>Under the system that governs domain names on the internet, the .cc suffix was set up in the 1990s for the Cocos (Keeling) Islands territory, far off the coast of Western Australia.</p> <p>Due to it being one of the cheapest domains to buy websites, the .cc suffix is one of the most commonly used top-level domains for hosting child abuse material, the ANU lecturer Dr James Mortsensen and the PhD researcher Samuel Bashfield wrote in Policy Forum on Tuesday.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/jun/01/acer-says-global-chip-shortage-to-slow-laptop-production-until-at-least-next-year\">Acer says global chip shortage to slow laptop production until at least next year</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Internet Watch Foundation ranked .cc in the top 10 of most-abused top-level domains in 2019 for hosting child sexual abuse material but it dropped <a href=\"http://domainincite.com/26642-iwf-finds-3401-commercial-child-porn-domains\">out of the top 10 in 2020</a>.

Under the system that governs domain names on the internet, the .cc suffix was set up in the 1990s for the Cocos (Keeling) Islands territory, far off the coast of Western Australia. Due to it being one of the cheapest domains to buy websites, the .cc suffix is one of the most commonly used top-level domains for hosting child abuse material, the ANU lecturer Dr James Mortsensen and the PhD researcher Samuel Bashfield wrote in Policy Forum on Tuesday. The Internet Watch Foundation ranked .cc in the top 10 of most-abused top-level domains in 2019 for hosting child sexual abuse material but it dropped out of the top 10 in 2020.

On 21 December, far-right rioters descended on the statehouse, attacking police officers and assaulting journalists as lawmakers inside were meeting to discuss how to respond to the Covid crisis. Many of the demonstrators would also be among the mob that attacked the US Capitol on 6 January. A video released on Friday shows representative Mike Nearman opening a door to the building, which was closed to the public, and inviting the rioters inside. In another video, Nearman tells protesters how to reach him. Even members from his own party have called for Nearman to resign, the Associated Press reports, and all 22 Republicans in the House signed a letter calling for him to step down. If he refuses, the House may vote to remove him. Oregon house speaker Tina Kotek introduced a resolution to expel Nearman with a two-thirds majority vote, and has assembled a committee to consider next steps. From the AP: In her resolution, Kotek said personnel who were authorized to be in the Oregon Capitol described the events on Dec. 21 as intense and stressful, terrifying and distressing. ‘Law enforcement officers were visibly injured and shaken due to the demonstrators’ action,’ Kotek added. ‘The severity of Representative Nearman’s actions and last week’s revelation that they were premeditated require a special committee to immediately consider expelling him from the House of Representatives,’ Kotek said. ‘He knowingly put the physical safety of everyone in the Capitol — lawmakers, staff and law enforcement — in jeopardy’”. Stormy Daniels said today that she is eager to share her story with New York prosecutors investigating the Trump Organization and that her lawyers have been in contact. “I have not been called to testify yet, but I’ve been very forthcoming since the beginning of all this that I would love nothing more than my day in court and to give a deposition and to provide whatever evidence that they need from me,” Daniels, said during an interview on CNN, adding that she still has emails and wire transcripts that could be used as evidence to indict the former president. Daniels, an adult-film actress whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, alleges that she had an affair with Trump before he became president, a claim he denies. Trump’s former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, was sentenced to three years in prison after admitting that he paid off Daniels and another woman on Trump’s behalf during the 2016 campaign. Manhattan prosecutors have been investigating Trump’s expansive company for two years, and District Attorney Cyrus Vance has convened a grand jury which will decide whether to indict Trump and other executives at the organization. “I would tell them that I was approached. I would tell them that I have evidence,” she said, claiming she can prove that the money came from an account set up by Trump himself.

A federal task force has found that more than 3,900 migrant children were separated from their families at the border under the Trump Administration, according to a new report from ABC News. “It is our moral imperative to not only reunite the families, but to provide them with the relief, resources, and services they need to heal,” Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, who chairs the task force, said in a statement. The Family Reunification Task Force, created by the Biden Administration in February, has been examining the previous president’s controversial “zero-tolerance policy” and is expected to release the official results of their investigation soon. But ABC reports that only a fraction of the children have been reunited with their families. Currently, 62 family members of separated children have been approved to reenter the US, and roughly 400 children have been repatriated to their home countries. From ABC: The report cites the unfolding humanitarian crisis and the benefits of having behavioral health services available in the United States for allowing those family members to come into the United States, the source said. Asked why so few families are currently in the process of being reunited, the Homeland Security official noted that it is a “giant task,” requiring coordination across several U.S. government agencies. But the “biggest hurdle” for the Biden administration has been getting parents “to trust the government again,” the official said. Stay tuned for more as the west coast takes over the liveblog! The justice department recovered $2.3m in cryptocurrency that Colonial Pipeline paid in ransom to Darkside following a cyber-attack last month that brought the nation’s largest fuel pipeline offline. In Guatemala, vice-president Kamala Harris delivered a blunt message for migrants considering making the dangerous journey north: “Do not come.” Idaho’s rightward political lurch has immersed the state’s Republicans in a political civil war from the grassroots to the executive mansion. In late May, Republican governor Brad Little angrily revoked an executive order banning mask mandates in the state, which had been put in place by his own militia-supporting lieutenant governor during a period when she was deputizing for him. Janice McGeachin ordered that Idaho cities and counties revoke mask orders, playing into a widespread fear among the far right that basic health measures to stop the spread of the coronavirus are a sign of government over-reach. Little called McGeachin’s action “tyranny” and a “stunt” and scuppered it after it had been in place for just a day. Observers say the bizarre fight is symptomatic of a much wider problem in Idaho and the rest of America. They fear that the political dynamics in Idaho – where far-right actors have won recruits and political momentum through uncompromising refusal to comply with public health measures – may presage a worrying direction of conservative politics in the country as a whole. Some more on the cryptocurrency recovery: Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco noted that the “sophisticated use of technology to hold businesses and even whole cities hostage for profit is a decidedly 21st century challenge – but the old adage ‘follow the money’ still applies.” In total, the Justice Department recovered $2.6m of the money that Colonial Pipeline paid in ransom. Here, an FBI agent documented how they followed the money: More on the Justice Department cryptocurrency operation: last month’s cyber-attack on Colonial Pipeline was part of a growing ransomware trend in the US. In fact, soon after the cyber-attack on Colonial Pipeline, another attack took meat-processing factories across the US offline. Basically, the way these attacks work is a group of cybercriminals will hack into company, or government’s, network, and scramble the data. The hacker then demands payment in exchange for handing back control of the system. In the Colonial Pipeline case, a group called Darkside took responsibility for the attack. “DarkSide is a ransomware-as-a-service network – that means developers who sell or lease ransomware to use in attacks, in return for a fee or share in the proceeds,” said Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco. “DarkSide and its affiliates have digitally stalked US companies for the better part of the year, and indiscriminately attacked victims that include key players in our nation’s critical infrastructure.” “Today, we turned the tables on DarkSide.” The Justice Department announced Monday that it has recovered millions in cryptocurrency paid in ransom by Colonial Pipeline. Last month, the nation’s largest fuel pipeline confirmed it paid $4.4m to a gang of hackers who broke into its computer systems and took it offline. “Ransomware attacks are always unacceptable, but when they target critical infrastructure, we will spare no effort in our response,” Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said. US vice president Kamala Harris said today that she had held “robust” talks with the president of Guatemala, Alejandro Giammattei, on the need to fight corruption and deter undocumented immigration from Central America to the United States. Reuters reports that: Speaking at a news conference with Giammattei, Harris delivered a blunt message to anyone thinking of making the dangerous journey north: “Do not come.” “We had a robust, candid and thorough conversation,” Harris said. “The president and I discussed that fundamentally, most people do not want to leave home, they don’t want to leave the place where the language they know is spoken.” She said that a task force combining resources from the US Justice, State and Treasury departments would work with local prosecutors to punish corrupt actors in Central America. The U.S. government has been pressing the “Northern Triangle” - El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras - to do more to tackle corruption in order to improve social conditions for its people and make them less eager to emigrate. But those efforts have been undermined by corruption scandals and resistance to US-backed judges known for their commitment to fighting graft, as well as concerns that the region is drifting towards more authoritarian tendencies. Harris is due to travel to Mexico after Guatemala for talks with the Mexican government on Tuesday. Her Guatemala visit was her first overseas trip as vice president, part of her mission of tackling root causes of migration from Central America to the United States. Disagreement has emerged over the best way to tackle corruption, with the United States giving recognition to anti-graft fighters the conservative government and its allies see as politically biased. Giammattei said the fight against narco-trafficking needed to be an integral part of tackling corruption. Meanwhile, Harris confirmed that the US would supply half a million Covid-19 vaccine doses to Guatemala. The disgraced former New York City mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner has given “informal advice” to some current contenders to lead the city, he said, though as a fraught mayoral election enters its final three weeks before primary voting, he refused to say who. Weiner, who was sentenced to 21 months in prison in 2017 for sending explicit messages to a 15-year-old girl, told the New York Times naming the campaigns he had advised “would hurt them”. Polling shows Eric Adams, Kathryn Garcia and Andrew Yang leading the running among Democrats in the strongly Democratic city, ahead of the primary on 22 June. The three centrists have been aided by problems affecting leading left-wingers, although Maya Wiley, a progressive former counsel to current mayor Bill de Blasio, benefitted from an endorsement by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Saturday. Weiner had been married to Huma Abedin, a key, long-time aide to Hillary Clinton, but his scandals ultimately destroyed the marriage. Joe Biden is preparing for his first foreign trip as president. He heads off to the United Kingdom on Wednesday ahead of the G7 summit, with planned meetings with Boris Johnson, the Queen and Vladimir Putin. The trip comes as a survey found that perception of the US’s global standing remains about the same in Europe as it did under the Trump administration, largely in part because of coronavirus response. In the first full White House press briefing in more than a year, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan addressed how the president will work on reestablishing the US’s standing abroad. At home, Democratic West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin penned a column stating his opposition to voting rights legislation in which he was expected to be a key vote. Today’s White House press briefing is the first full press briefing in more than a year: Joe Biden has recently tasked vice president Kamala Harris to lead efforts on voting rights legislation. Press secretary Jen Psaki said voting rights remains a priority for the Biden administration, even with Democratic West Virginia senator Joe Manchin stating his opposition to the For the People Act in a column this weekend. “The president knows he was elected to deliver for the American people and his view is that includes making voting more accessible for people across the country, making it easier and not harder to vote,” Psaki said. “Clearly Senator Manchin has stated his point of view in his opinion piece over the weekend, which many of you, it sounds like, have read, and so have we. The president’s view is that we need to move forward, not just with the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, but with legislation like the For the People Act.” National security advisor Jake Sullivan said ransomware will be a priority topic at the G7 summit, as well as “speaking in a NATO context about cyberthreats as they relate to critical infrastructure”. This comes after cyber-attacks recently brought a gas pipeline and meat-processing factories across the US offline. “One of the things we’d like to see out of G7 is the start of an action plan,” Sullivan said. “First, how to deal with increasing the robustness and resilience of our defenses against ransomware attacks collectively. Second, how to share information about the nature of the threat among our democracies. Third, how to deal with the cryptocurrency that lies at the core of how these ransom transactions are played out. And finally, how we collectively speak with one voice to those countries, including Russia, that are harboring or permitting cyber criminals to operate from their territories.” PBS reporter Yamiche Alcindor asked Sullivan about “how President Biden plans to convince, especially our European allies, that former President Trump was an anomaly in some ways.” “Our view going into this trip is that actions speak louder than words,” Sullivan said. “Showing that the United States is capable of turning the corner on the pandemic, showing that the United States is capable of making the dramatic investments that will pull us up and out of this economic recovery and help power global growth, showing the world that we are ultimately capable of making the investments in R&amp;D and infrastructure, innovation and workforce, ultimately setting that foundation for this country will be the most effective way to show the rest of the world that the United States has the power and purpose to deliver as the world’s leading democracy. That’s what he’s going to try and demonstrate.” The unspoken elephant in the press room is a recent survey that found that Biden has not brought back the United States’ global standing to where it was before Covid-19 and Trump. Sullivan went further on the point later in the briefing, saying he felt that Biden is going into this phase of rebuilding global standing from “a record of strength”. “What President Biden can do is show the rest of the world what America is capable of,” Sullivan said. “If we can lead the world in ending the Covid-19 pandemic more rapidly, if the growth we are powering for the America people here at home helps power a global economic recovery, if we can help rally - as the president did with his climate leader summit - action on the climate crisis so we actually beat this thing ultimately, that is going to be the best way for people to say, ‘Man, the United States can do this’.” National security advisor Jake Sullivan kicked off the White House press briefing today by outlining the first foreign trip for Joe Biden as president. He addressed the Axios interview with Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in which he beseeched Biden to meet with him before he met with Vladimir Putin in Geneva on 16 June. Sullivan said he had just come from the Oval Office, where Biden had finished a phone call with Zelenskiy that they had planned in advance of the Putin meeting. “They had the opportunity to talk at some length about all the issues in the US-Ukraine relationship,” Sullivan said. “President Biden was able to tell President Zelenskiy that he will stand up firmly for Ukraine’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and its aspirations as we go forward. He also told President Zelenskiy that he looks forward to welcoming him to the White House here in Washington this summer as he returns from Europe.” Fred Ryan, publisher of the Washington Post, has taken the Biden administration to task for seizing reporters’ phone records in leak investigations. Though the Justice Department released a statement Saturday asserting that it “will not seek compulsory legal process in leak investigations to obtain source information from the media doing their jobs,” Ryan argued that the damage was done, and to the detriment of the country. Over the years, revelations by confidential government sources have informed Americans of serious missteps by our leaders and institutions that possess great power but little accountability. The sinister experiments at the Tuskegee Institute, the controversial interrogations at secret CIA prisons and dangerous lapses in the Secret Service’s protection of the president are just a few of the countless stories that emerged because government sources, trusting reporters to keep their identities secret, served the public’s right to know. Trump’s actions, and the expansion upon them during the Biden administration, pose a grave threat to our ability as a nation to keep powerful officials in check. With the revelation that the Justice Department has secretly obtained phone and email records at multiple news organizations to sniff out the identities of journalists’ sources, government employees who would otherwise come forward to reveal malfeasance are more likely to fear exposure and retaliation, and therefore to stay silent. In office, Donald Trump said Republicans in the Senate should scrap the filibuster, by which a minority can block the will of the majority, because it “allowed eight Democrats to control the country”. Out of office, he has changed his mind – saying in effect it is good that Republican senators and a few Democratic allies can control the country in the precise same way. The former president told Fox Business on Monday he supported the Democratic senator Joe Manchin in his refusal to budge on the issue. “It’s a very important thing,” Trump said. “Otherwise you’re going to be packing the courts, you’re going to be doing all sorts of very bad things that were unthinkable.” Faced with Republican opposition to federal voting rights reform – and other matters including the establishment of a commission to investigate the US Capitol attack – most Democrats favour scrapping the filibuster, under which most legislation must gain 60 votes to pass. They will not be able to do so, in large part because Manchin, from West Virginia, and the Arizona Democrat Kyrsten Sinema have set themselves against it. On Sunday, Manchin also set himself directly against the voting rights legislation in question, the For the People Act, a move that pleased Republicans and enraged progressives. Trump has direct experience of how the filibuster can frustrate a political agenda. In July 2017, faced with the failure of attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, he tweeted: “Republican Senate must get rid of 60 vote NOW! It is killing the R Party, allows 8 Dems to control country. 200 Bills sit in Senate. A JOKE!” Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, then Senate majority leader, refused to budge. Now the Senate minority leader, he is still immovable on the filibuster – as are Manchin and Sinema. In his Fox Business interview, Trump also repeated his lie that his defeat by Joe Biden last year was the result of electoral fraud, a lie which stoked the deadly Capitol attack, after which Trump was impeached and suspended from major social media platforms. Reporting the interview, the Daily Beast plumped for a succinct headline: “Fox Host Offers Absolutely Zero Pushback When Trump Spews Election Bullshit.” Secretary of State Andrew Blinken is testifying before two House committees about the federal budget. At the moment, he’s in front of House Foreign Affairs Committee, testifying about everything from vaccine distribution to Israel. While Joe Biden prepares for his first foreign trip, in which one of the first agenda items include meeting with Boris Johnson to affirm the US’s “special relationship” with Britain, Johnson has decided to make it clear that he doesn’t care all too much about the term “special relationship”. Downing Street confirmed today that Johnson is not a fan of the term to describe US-UK relations, believing it seemed “needy and weak”. “The prime minister is on the record previously saying he prefers not to use the phrase but that in no way detracts from the importance with which we regard our relationship with the US, our closest ally,” a Johnson spokesman said. The term is credited to Winston Churchill. As Joe Biden prepares for his trip to Europe, a survey found that he has not brought back the United States’ global standing to where it was before Covid-19, Reuters reports. A poll of 11 countries conducted by the German Marshall Fund and the Bertelsmann Foundation found that Washington’s handling of the pandemic diminished many European’s views of the United States, particularly in France and Germany. “The first three months of the Biden administration have not affected French and German views of US influence in the world,” the study said. US research papers released in March talk about how the US under Donald Trump could have avoided nearly 400,000 deaths with a more effective strategy. Nearly 600,000 Americans have died from Covid-19 since the start of the pandemic. Within the United States, since Biden has taken office, many seem to lean toward the perception that US influence abroad has risen, the survey found. While most Americans consider the European Union as a reliable partner, only 51% of Germans see the US as one. In France, the number is 60%, and 67% in the United Kingdom. Fewer than a quarter of Turks trust the United States. Republican Alabama Representative Mo Brooks has been served with a lawsuit filed by Democratic California Representative Eric Swalwell accusing him and other allies of Donald Trump of instigating the 6 January attack on the US Capitol. Swalwell’s legal team, which has already served Trump, Donald Trump Jr and Rudy Giuliani with the lawsuit, had stated previously that they had been having trouble getting in touch with Brooks. But this weekend, Brooks accused them of committing a crime in order to do so. Philip Andonian, an attorney for Swalwell, denied Brooks’ comments to CNN: “No one entered or even attempted to enter the Brooks’ house. That allegation is completely untrue. A process server lawfully served the papers on Mo Brooks’ wife, as the federal rules allow,” he told CNN. “This was after her initial efforts to avoid service. Mo Brooks has no one but himself to blame for the fact that it came to this. We asked him to waive service, we offered to meet him at a place of his choosing. Instead of working things out like a civilized person, he engaged in a juvenile game of Twitter trolling over the past few days and continued to evade service. He demanded that we serve him. We did just that. The important thing is the complaint has been served and Mo Brooks can now be held accountable for his role in inciting the deadly insurrection at the Capitol.” In his rush to accuse Swalwell’s team of entering his house unlawfully, however, it appears that Brooks also tweeted out his gmail passwords and his pin, which were written on a sticky note attached to his computer. Jen Psaki, Biden’s White House press secretary, went on CNN’s Reliable Sources to talk about Fox News, Newsmax and other rightwing outlets. She likened them to “propaganda pushers” and “representatives of the Russian and Chinese media asking questions directed by their government.” “The things that get under my skin are when the premise of a question is based on inaccurate information, misleading information,” she said. Psaki also defended the Biden administration against criticism for holding only one presidential press conference: “That may be driven more by the media than it is by the American public,” she said. The Supreme Court has declined to review a lawsuit challenging the country’s male-only draft registration policy as unconstitutional. Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote essentially that Congress should take the lead on the issue on whether all genders should be required to register with the Selective Service System at age 18 and be considered for military service should a draft be called up again. While the Trump administration had defended the policy, Joe Biden’s acting solicitor general Elizabeth B. Prelogar had advised the court not to take up the issue because Congress was considering including women in the draft registration, the Washington Post reports. In case you missed it, Democratic West Virginia senator Joe Manchin took out a column in the Charleston Gazette-Mail on Sunday to say that he would be opposing the For the People Act. “I believe that partisan voting legislation will destroy the already weakening binds of our democracy,” wrote Manchin, who was considered a key vote to counter efforts by Republicans in state government to restrict voting rights. Reaction was swift. Manchin also used the column to reiterate his support of the filibuster, which gives 41 of 100 senators the ability to block action by the majority. Democrats have argued that Republicans have repeated used the filibuster to support minority positions - last month, they used it to block the creation of a bipartisan, 9/11-style investigatory commission on the attack on the US capitol. A study by the Center for American Progres found that Republicans used filibusters roughly twice as much as Democrats to prevent the other party from passing legislation. For a hot second this weekend, the Internet united as everyone lost their minds over a possible theory that Donald Trump may have worn his pants backwards at the North Carolina Republican Party’s state convention on Saturday night. Images and video from his speech that appeared to show a lack of a fly at the front, as well as some odd wrinkling, had Internet sleuths questioning Trump’s fashion’s choices - and #TrumpPants trending on Twitter. But after reviewing 90 minutes of footage, Snopes declared that the theory was false. Greetings, live blog readers.

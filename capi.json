Japan, South Korea, India, Taiwan, Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam are hoping to develop their own jabs after struggling to get vaccines from overseas, according to the South China Morning Post. While locally developed vaccines aren’t likely to affect the pandemic in its current phase, they believe it’s a better long-term approach. Germany has registered 2,440 new cases in the last 24 hours, and 24.7 cases per 100,000 people, according to the country’s Robert Koch Institute. The latest figures show 74 more people have died from the virus, meaning the death toll now stands at 89,222. There has been a total of 3,700,367 positive tests for Covid since the start of the pandemic. The new Delta variant of coronavirus appears to be about 40% more transmissible than the variant it has largely replaced, Matt Hancock has said, making government decisions about whether to ease restrictions in England on 21 June “more difficult”. Saying that under-30s will be called to begin vaccinations from next week, the health secretary confirmed it was still possible the reopening programme could be delayed or some rules kept in place. “We consider all options,” he told Sky News. Away from the UK, Russia has reported 9,145 new Covid-19 cases and a further 399 deaths. A total of 5,117,274 people have tested positive in the country. The death toll in the country now stands at 123,436. Russia’s own state statistics service, Rosstat, keeps its own records and said on Friday that about 270,000 people had died from the virus and related causes as of April. Excess deaths in the county stand at 425,000 from between April 2020 and April 2021. Marr rounds off by asking whether the health secretary regretted using the phrase about a “protective ring” around care homes. “I said that much later about what we were doing for the winter plans, but it’s been interpreted,” he says, but changes the subject on to the return of children to school tomorrow after half-term. “On testing, tomorrow schoolchildren will be going back to school. You must get tests done this evening because right now secondary school-age children getting their tests done tonight is the most important thing that can be done today.” Marr asks whether Hancock will apologise for any failings on his part during the pandemic, as Cummings did. “At that time everybody was working as hard as possible to protect as many lives as possible on the evidence we had at the time,” he says. “This is true of different administrations and across the whole of Europe. “I know those decisions were taken on the best evidence with the best of intentions.” Marr ends by asking whether Hancock’s been honest and transparent during the pandemic after claims made by Dominic Cummings during his select committee appearance last week. He plays a clip of Cummings saying that in March 2020 Hancock said people would be tested before they went back to care homes and there was a protective shield around them. “It’s complete nonsense,” Cummings said. He asks Hancock whether he told Johnson that people would be tested before they went into care homes. He replies: “We know the testing wasn’t available to test everybody. The advice was that very few people would be able to pass on Covid if they didn’t have any symptoms, so we reserved that for people with symptoms. “The situation with regards to care homes, we brought in a policy of wanting to test everybody going into a care home as soon as we had those tests available. Everyone had a challenge around Europe, in Scotland in Wales, some of the most vulnerable to Covid live in care homes, but at the time, you’ll remember we didn’t have the testing capacity and I built that up, put in place the hundreds of thousands targets and then we could put that into place.” On the idea of children being vaccinated, Hancock says the government is following clinical advice. “There’s good advantages, there’s the reduction in transmission from children to parents and grandparents who might be vulnerable. There’s advantages in protecting education, if one child gets one positive test, the whole bubble has to isolate. “We should follow and listen to clinical advice … I don’t want to put pressure on them with their advice. People should be reassured that whatever steps we take they are on a clinically advised basis.” In response to a question about vaccine passports, or certification along the lines mentioned by Tony Blair, Hancock says: “We know some other countries are going to require it. So if you want to go some other countries, you already have to, the EU are talking about it. It’s my job to make sure you can have that. “If you download the NHS app right now and register it will show you your vaccine status, so you can prove it if you want to go to Greece, for example.” He says rules in the UK are down to a certification review and that there is downsides on a mandatory basis. Hancock repeats Sage’s findings that the India variant is 40% more transmissible. In turn Marr quotes a Sage report saying that a variant of that level of transmissibility would cause severe disruption to the roadmap. Hancock says: “We’re watching the case rates and the rate in which that transfers into hospitalisations. Thankfully that link, which was absolutely rock solid over the autumn, is severed but not broken. There are some people in hospital who have been double vaccinated, but very few. The majority in hospital haven’t been. “Critically, those who are double vaccinated, even if they’re in hospital, they appear to be less ill. The vaccine is working and is our way through it, the new variant, which is more transmissible is making that calculation harder.” Matt Hancock’s now appearing on Marr, after his earlier interview on Sky News’ Trevor Phillips on Sunday. He first responds to an earlier interview by Bob Geldof calling for more vaccines to go to developing countries. The health secretary references Boris Johnson’s call to get the planet vaccinated by the end of 2022, and the rollout of the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab at cost to low and middle income countries. The cut to the aid budget, he says, is supposed to be temporary. “We also have this enormous cost there, so we can continue investing in the NHS, which we are doing, but there’s many things we are doing, leadership on climate change and certainly the work that AZ and Oxford University have done that a quarter of the vaccines across the whole world are delivered with UK taxpayers cash, at cost, no charge on intellectual property, and that’s saving lives everywhere.” Nandy backs vaccination for children after the JCVI’s approval of the Pfizer jab for 12-15 year olds. “I think the regulator has been clear that for 12-year-olds and over the Pfizer vaccine is safe and it’s apparent that the rise in transmission rates is being driven by young people. “It’s right to follow the public health officials particularly the ones that are saying ‘this is what we want to do’. “If public health directors are saying ‘we’ve got a problem in our secondary schools and we need to open up the vaccine, not to make it mandatory, offer the chance to get them vaccinated’, then we need to listen. If we’d taken that approach from the start we’d be in a far better place now.” On international travel Nandy says she believes the current Amber list for international travel from the UK should be scrapped. Current rules mean people travelling to the UK from those countries must quarantine at home or the place they are staying for 10 days and take two Covid tests during that period. She adds: “It’s confusing and that confusion is dangerous at the moment and risks unravelling all the progress that we’ve made. “I think we should have robust quarantine measures for people coming back into the country. “We need to be much clearer that at the moment travelling overseas, particularly when you’ve got countries like Vietnam and Thailand on the amber list where new variants are emerging and being imported into the UK, is the wrong thing to do and the government ought to be clear about that.” Labour’s shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy tells Marr says she’s sceptical on a domestic level on vaccine passports. “I think the global case for vaccine passports is clear because other countries are doing it, but at a domestic level for many of the reasons that you’ve highlighted, discriminatory practices, how they would be enforced, I think there are potentially real problems.” Here’s more detail on the proposal put forward by the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change. People who have been vaccinated against Covid-19 should be able to travel abroad using a new digital pass and go to “vaccine-only” venues such as restaurants or sports stadiums, Tony Blair says today. Releasing a report entitled “Less Risk, More Freedom”, by the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, the former prime minister says the time has come “to distinguish for the purposes of freedom from restriction between the vaccinated and unvaccinated”. The report argues that to date, measures intended to reduce the spread of disease have treated populations as largely homogenous groups. As a result, restrictions – such as national lockdowns, regional-tier systems and entire schools closed following outbreaks – have been blunt instruments. Tony Blair’s on BBC One’s Andrew Marr Show. He says he thinks it’s “uncertain” as to whether the UK will carry on with rules being relaxed on 21 June. Marr says that with introducing vaccine passports or certification status, it will end up discriminating against people who have not had the jab. Blair replies: “Discrimination has got a very loaded meaning in the English Language now. Really when it comes to risk management it’s all about discrimination. The reason we vaccinate the elderly first is that they are more at risk. The reason we ensure people are vaccinated is that we reduce the risk of transmission.” In response to a follow-up question, the former prime minister adds that there needs to be exemptions made for certain groups, including the disabled, as it would be “totally inappropriate” to discriminate against them. Taiwan reported 343 new Covid-19 cases on Sunday, down from 511 reported the day before. The US announced on Sunday that it will give it 750,000 vaccine doses. Phillips asks if we could be giving more vaccines to other countries ahead of the G7 summit next week. Hancock says: “My first duty is to protect the UK population, and that’s to reduce transmission. The way we’re helping the rest of the world is giving away at cost the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine and that means of the 2 billion doses delivered across the world, 500m doses are the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. 70% of those doses are in low and middle-income countries. “The reason we’ve been able to do this is is that we’ve made it available at cost, no charge of intellectual property from the start. I’m delighted there’s a debate, around the G7 table on how to vaccinate the world, but this country has done more than any other by ensuring the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is available at cost.” Responding on whether the government will respond to Blair’s call earlier (see 8.19), for global vaccine passports, as well as relaxations domestically for people who have had the jab. Hancock says: “This debate has been going on for months and we’ve been doing the work inside government, and we’ll be coming out with our answers on that soon. “We know it’s going to be needed internationally, on the domestic front, that’s a matter for Michael Gove.” Phillips asks if the government will want to vaccinate all children. The UK regulator, Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, approved the Pfizer jab for use on children aged between 12 and 15 earlier this week. A story in the Sunday Telegraph said that under plans drawn up by Whitehall, they would be offered the jab from mid-August. Hancock doesn’t rule it out, and says: “We’ve got a few weeks until we come out with a plan on how and if we take this forward. “We know the vaccine both protects you and helps stops it transmitting, and I want to protect education as much as anybody does. Making sure we don’t have those whole bubbles going home and the isolation, that has big upsides for education.” Under-30s are being invited to get their jabs this week, Hancock adds, as he says the link between infection and serious illness has been “severed but not broken” by the vaccine. Phillips asks whether there will be a modification of the roadmap, such as lifting lockdown but still asking people to work from home. “There are a series of things at the moment that we’ve said will be part of step four, which include the rule of six and the fact there’s still some businesses that are closed. “We have four reviews into international travel and certification and social distancing, and we are concluding those reviews and doing that at the same time.” Hancock urges people to go and get their second dose to try and stop the damage being caused by the India variant, that is 40% more transmissible. “It’s more difficult to manage this virus with the new variant. But after two doses of vaccine we are confident that you get the same protection as you did with the old variant. “The vaccine works just as effectively, and everyone must get their second jab though, as the first on its own isn’t quite as effective.” The health secretary Matt Hancock is on Sky News’ Trevor Phillips on Sunday, as part of a morning broadcast tour. He asks Hancock whether there will be a delay to the relaxing of restrictions on 21 June. “It’s too early to make a final decision on that,” Hancock begins. “The prime minister and the team will be looking over all the data over this week and we’ve said we will be giving people enough time ahead of 21 June when this is pencilled in, this next step.” He says it will depend on the four tests; cases, hospitalisations, the rollout of the vaccine and the impact of new variants. Hancock admits that there has been a significant impact of the Delta variant. Boris Johnson will urge G7 leaders to “defeat Covid” by vaccinating the world by the end of next year. The prime minister will stress the importance of the programme when he meets leaders on Friday in Cornwall for the first face-to-face G7 meeting since the beginning of the pandemic. The US, France, Germany, Italy and Japan have all said how many doses they will donate to the global vaccine programme, Covax. However the UK and Canada are yet to announce how many they will contribute. Johnson will also call for a global watch system to catch new variants before they spread more widely. Johnson said: “I’m calling on my fellow G7 leaders to join us to end this terrible pandemic and pledge will we never allow the devastation wreaked by coronavirus to happen again.” Head of the UK vaccines taskforce Kate Bingham is to be given a damehood, the Telegraph has reported, after getting the UK access to millions of doses of six different jabs. Her expected honour is among a number in next week’s Queen’s Birthday honours dedicated to “heroes” in the pandemic. Bingham was appointed to the role in May last year and left at the end of 2020. People who have had both doses of a Covid-19 vaccine should have restrictions relaxed for them, according to former prime minister Tony Blair. Blair’s thinktank, the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, sets out how the country should remain open if the virus persists in the population. The report, Less Risk, More Freedom, says that the NHS app – which is currently used for contact tracing – should be replaced with a system of global health passes. “The health pass needs to be usable both by national border authorities and other organisations within countries. It should also include the ability to demonstrate time-restricted testing status for those who aren’t able to be vaccinated. “With this ability to securely prove vaccination status, we can move beyond blunt, catch-all tools and align with other countries by removing certain restrictions for the fully vaccinated – thereby enabling us to sustainably reopen the economy,” the report says.

Gunn, who still owns one beach hut, puts the explosion over the last few years down in part to social media, where the bright colours and kitschy designs quickly attract fans. “Instagram is unbelievable now,” she said. “Every beach hut owner who has styled their hut is showcasing their renovations — they want to show it off.” This year, both of Gunn’s huts featured on the BBC TV show Interior Design Masters with Alan Carr. “It’s like an element of keeping up with the Joneses – if people are going to hire a beach hut, they want to take pictures and they want it to be nice.”","charCount":"2648","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"true","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/robyn-vinter\">Robyn Vinter</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/live/2021/jun/06/yorkshire-v-sussex-somerset-v-hampshire-and-more-county-cricket-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-06T09:42:40Z","webTitle":"Yorkshire v Sussex, Somerset v Hampshire and more: county cricket – live!","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2021/jun/06/yorkshire-v-sussex-somerset-v-hampshire-and-more-county-cricket-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2021/jun/06/yorkshire-v-sussex-somerset-v-hampshire-and-more-county-cricket-live","fields":{"headline":"Yorkshire v Sussex, Somerset v Hampshire and more: county cricket – live!","standfirst":"<ul><li>Live coverage from the action around the grounds</li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2021/jun/05/yorkshire-v-sussex-glamorgan-v-lancs-and-more-county-cricket-live?page=with:block-60bbd6598f082ac930aeb6d5#block-60bbd6598f082ac930aeb6d5\">Saturday roundup: Labuschagne hits his groove in Glamorgan win</a></li><li><a href=\"mailto:tanya.aldred.freelance@theguardian.com\">Email Tanya</a> with any thoughts | Tweet <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tjaldred\">@tjaldred</a></li></ul>","trailText":"<strong>Rolling report:</strong> Join Tanya Aldred for live County Championship coverage from around the grounds","byline":"Tanya Aldred","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9b05907dd8b65050323aac0e6872a2896449ba77\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b05907dd8b65050323aac0e6872a2896449ba77/762_1452_3319_1992/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yorkshire had first-innings lead of 245 midway through the evening before Sussex closed Saturday’s action on a sturdy 38 without loss. \" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yorkshire had first-innings lead of 245 midway through the evening before Sussex closed Saturday’s action on a sturdy 38 without loss. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: George Wood/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<div id=\"block-60bc97368f08b9889b36a6c6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-06T09:42:40.799Z\">10.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Dawid Malan </strong>, who I’m reliably informed played a perfectly-judged innings yesterday, driving particularly well before being out for 199, spoke engagingly last night:</p> <p>“ I’ve tried to learn from my failures at Test cricket and put that into practice in four-day cricket. </p> <p>“Since 2019, I think my record speaks for itself in just having that fearless approach in four-day cricket and backing my technique and way of playing. <br></p> <p><strong>Possible Test return?</strong></p> <p>“I wouldn’t be here playing four-day cricket if I didn’t want to play Test cricket again.

No venue would be forced to become “vaccine-only”, but those that opted to do so would be subject to fewer restrictions.</p> <p>The report says the effectiveness of vaccines in reducing transmission is now proven beyond doubt and should be reflected in the freedoms people can enjoy. “Ultimately, the fully vaccinated are much less likely to infect others – approximately up to 50% less likely,” it says. “Furthermore, they are less likely to die, be hospitalised or develop Covid-19 symptoms compared to pre-vaccine.</p> <p>“Simply put, vaccine status matters.

It should also include the ability to demonstrate time-restricted testing status for those who aren’t able to be vaccinated.</p> <p>“With this ability to securely prove vaccination status, we can move beyond blunt, catch-all tools and align with other countries by removing certain restrictions for the fully vaccinated – thereby enabling us to sustainably reopen the economy.”</p> <p>For travel, the report proposes that anyone who is fully vaccinated should be free to travel to and from any country currently designated as “green” without any quarantine period or testing required.</p> <p>Commenting on the report, Blair said: “The management of the Covid-19 pandemic is all about that management of risk. We place or remove restrictions here at home on that basis. We assess countries as green, amber or red on that basis. We vaccinate on the same basis. We know that vaccination radically reduces the risk of transmission and the risk of serious illness. It doesn’t eliminate the risk. But the reduction is substantial and game-changing. Hence the country’s embrace of vaccination and pride in doing it quickly.</p> <p>“It is time to distinguish for the purposes of freedom from restriction between the vaccinated and unvaccinated, both for citizens here for domestic purposes; but also for our citizens and those from other countries in respect of travel on the basis that being vaccinated substantially reduces risk. It therefore makes no sense at all to treat those who have had vaccination as the same as those who haven’t.”</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"6","wordcount":"540","firstPublicationDate":"2021-06-06T09:30:35Z","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2021-06-06T09:30:35Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2021-06-06T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"The Observer","shortUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/p/hkn2f","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/5492edab9eec4dc839037830233ed295601967e1/0_116_3500_2101/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","isLive":"true","bodyText":"People who have been vaccinated against Covid-19 should be able to travel abroad using a new digital pass and go to “vaccine-only” venues such as restaurants or sports stadiums, Tony Blair says today.

No venue would be forced to become “vaccine-only”, but those that opted to do so would be subject to fewer restrictions. The report says the effectiveness of vaccines in reducing transmission is now proven beyond doubt and should be reflected in the freedoms people can enjoy. “Ultimately, the fully vaccinated are much less likely to infect others – approximately up to 50% less likely,” it says. “Furthermore, they are less likely to die, be hospitalised or develop Covid-19 symptoms compared to pre-vaccine. “Simply put, vaccine status matters. It is therefore critical that individuals are able to prove their vaccine status.” It advocates a “globally interoperable system of health passes” which would enable citizens to prove their status in a secure, “privacy-preserving way”. It adds: “The health pass needs to be usable both by national border authorities and other organisations within countries. It should also include the ability to demonstrate time-restricted testing status for those who aren’t able to be vaccinated. “With this ability to securely prove vaccination status, we can move beyond blunt, catch-all tools and align with other countries by removing certain restrictions for the fully vaccinated – thereby enabling us to sustainably reopen the economy.” For travel, the report proposes that anyone who is fully vaccinated should be free to travel to and from any country currently designated as “green” without any quarantine period or testing required. Commenting on the report, Blair said: “The management of the Covid-19 pandemic is all about that management of risk. We place or remove restrictions here at home on that basis. We assess countries as green, amber or red on that basis. We vaccinate on the same basis. We know that vaccination radically reduces the risk of transmission and the risk of serious illness. It doesn’t eliminate the risk. But the reduction is substantial and game-changing. Hence the country’s embrace of vaccination and pride in doing it quickly. “It is time to distinguish for the purposes of freedom from restriction between the vaccinated and unvaccinated, both for citizens here for domestic purposes; but also for our citizens and those from other countries in respect of travel on the basis that being vaccinated substantially reduces risk. It therefore makes no sense at all to treat those who have had vaccination as the same as those who haven’t.”","charCount":"3443","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/tobyhelm\">Toby Helm</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2021/jun/06/andrew-mcmillan-pandemonium-review-steeped-in-suffering","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-06T09:30:35Z","webTitle":"Andrew McMillan: pandemonium review – steeped in suffering","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/jun/06/andrew-mcmillan-pandemonium-review-steeped-in-suffering","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2021/jun/06/andrew-mcmillan-pandemonium-review-steeped-in-suffering","fields":{"headline":"Andrew McMillan: pandemonium review – steeped in suffering","standfirst":"<p>The poet reflects on death, depression and guilt with a clear eye in this troubling and fascinating collection</p>","trailText":"The poet reflects on death, depression and guilt with a clear eye in this troubling and fascinating collection","byline":"Kate Kellaway","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"27a53e7bb4f226032906f5a40081a87dff66990a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/27a53e7bb4f226032906f5a40081a87dff66990a/3_343_5240_3145/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andrew McMillan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘In his charming and modest way, he has mastered the art of self-reproach’: Andrew McMillan.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pako Mera/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure>","body":"<p>The title p<em>andemonium </em>seems wrong for a collection as collected as this. For although Andrew McMillan is writing about a period of turbulence involving the depression of his partner, the death of his sister’s baby and various reckonings with himself, the overall quality is of stunned calm. He is not only at the eye of the storm, he <em>is</em> the eye of the storm. It is a fascinating collection – troubling and moving to read. Its atmosphere is distinct from his earlier books <em>physical</em> (2015) – an interrogation of masculinity – and <em>playtime</em> (2018) – an exploration of gay adolescence. And this is because there is no poem in it unmarked by suffering. Pain, in these poems, becomes a form of clarity. And, in his charming and modest way, McMillan has mastered the art of self-reproach.

The poem relives a hectic crisis and yet, on the page, becomes trauma recollected in tranquillity. We are later shown how, just as it is possible to miss early signs of depression, it is easy to celebrate too soon. McMillan writes especially keenly about false seasons and false senses of security. In uncivil, he describes: “unseasonal daffodils/curling up tricked/by the few good days we’ve had” and in another untitled poem, behaves like the daffodils himself:</p> \n<p><em>each year I’m tricked by early spring<br>the eye of winter when the grey slips off</em></p> \n<p>Yet, as poet, he is neither absent nor tricked; he is on high alert. His sister’s stillborn son is another false spring – and he writes a beautiful sequence dedicated to George 1.8.19-1.8.19:</p> \n<p><em>no one is sure how we should look after<br>this sadness uninvited unwelcome</em></p> \n<p>This, taken in context, comes across as a maternal quandary and there is a gentle restraint to settling for “sadness” as a word, not writing it up into anything grander. And then:</p> \n<p><em>it’s days before my parents sleep again</em></p> \n<p><em>their daughter gone to grief<br>their other daughter stoic</em></p> \n<p>Again “gone to grief” tells you plainly all you need to know. Sometimes, when life hits hard, it is best to travel light as a writer – events have their own charge.

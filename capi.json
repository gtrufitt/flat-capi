There is that good focus with the understanding we are facing a Swansea team that has done a fantastic season.<br></p> <p>“We’ve played them twice, both 1-1 draws. Steve Cooper is one of the most talented managers in this country, and his experienced coaching staff, who have just performed and performed even better. It’s going to be unbelievably tight. That experience from last year will help in a way but it is not like we are suddenly 20 per cent better. It might help in the decisive moments.”<br></p> <p>“You saw in the game against Bournemouth how much the fans can help us; they had a massive impact on the result. We need the fans there to cheer us on throughout the game because this game will take twists and turns. We will all be a tiny bit more tense but that is a good thing.

It would mean everything. The club has been there before, quite some time before I was here, and that journey was a special one.</p> <p>“Then it was taken away through relegation, and you have to re-establish yourself and rebuild with a different identity. We have got to the last game of this season and given ourselves a 50-50 chance of winning - which is what a final is - and it is something we really have to go for. It would mean everything to the city, it would mean everything to the club and everyone is aware of that.</p> <p>“We talk about it at length, among the players and staff, and it is a massive motivation to get the job done. At the same time, we have to focus on the job at hand and what it takes to get it done; the performance, the mentality and winning the game.

At the tenth time of asking, Brentford have finally progressed through play-offs and in doing so earn their place in the top flight for next season. 90+5 min: Cabango rolls the ball wide of the far post from an offside position. The flag goes up. 90+4 min: Swansea get the ball upfield but are unable to muster a goal threat due in no small part to dogged Brentford defending. 90+3 min: Brentford corner. They take it short ... and who can blame them? 90+2 min: Brentford throw on another sub in a bid to waste time. Man of the match Emiliano is replaced by Mads Bidstrup. 90 min: Into the knockings we go but we’ll have a minimum of SIX added minutes. 89 min: Yan Dhanda shoots high over the bar from the edge of the Brentford penalty area as the ball was cleared his way from a Swansea City free-kick. 88 min: The jig looks well and truly up for Swansea City, who did well just to make the play-offs on a fairly small budget. They keep plugging away as full time approaches. 85 min: Manning wins his side a free-kick wide on the left, in line with the left side of the Brentford penalty area. Manning floats the ball straight into the gloves of Raya with a woeful delivery. 84 min: Swansea substitution: Jake Bidwell is replaced by Ryan Manning. 82 min: Toney picks up the ball in space on the right side of the Swans’ penalty area, but has his shot on goal blocked by Jake Bidwell. From the ensuing corner, both Toney and Mbeumo are wrestled to the ground by defenders but neither player is awarded a penalty. 80 min: Ivan Toney chases a long hoof upfield from Mads Roerslav. He hads the legs of Ben Cabango, who manages to head the ball back to Freddie Woodman before Toney can chase him down. 78 min: There’s a break in play as Brentford captain Pontus Jansson receives treatment for an injury that spells the end of his afternoon at the office. He’s replaced by Winston Reid. 76 min: Just 14 minutes to go and it’s looking extremely sweet indeed for Brentford, who are two goals and one man to the good. Not even they can blow this ... can they? 74 min: Brentford double-substitution: Marcus Forss and Saman Ghoddos on for Sergi Canos and Vitaly Janelt. 73 min: Emiliano takes the free-kick, curling the ball up and over the bar. 71 min: Brentford win a throw-in, deep in Swansea City territory. From that, they win a free-kick three or four yards outside the penalty area for a Guehi foul on Ivan Toney. It’s almost straight in front of goal. 70 min: Vitaly Yanelt is booked for deliberately obstructing the progress of Connor Roberts out by the touchline. Free-kick for Swansea, near enough to the corner flag. Brentford clear. What on earth was he thinking? Shocking on first view, but looking at it again perhaps I was a little harsh. The Swansea City midfielder slipped while chasing a loose ball, then went through Mathias Jensen from behind, appearing to stamp on his achilles. Whatever the intent or lack of it, it is definitely a sending-off offence. Swansea are down to 10 men following a shocking challenge from Jay Fulton. 64 min: Swansea City substitution: Yan Dhanda on for Conor Hourihane. 62 min: Mbeumo’s corner fizzes right across the face of goal. The ball breaks to Ethan Pinnock, who was having his shirt vigorously pulled by his marker. He escapes and gets a ashot off regardless but his effort is unwittingly blocked by Pontus Jansson, his own team-mate. Such was its velocity that it flattened the Brentford defender, who needs treatment. 61 min: Brentford win a corner, the ball going out off Jake Bidwell. 60 min: Swansea substitution: Liam Cullen on for Kyle Naughton. 59 min: With his back to goal, Jamal Lowe shoots on the turn from the right edge of the Brentford six-yard box. He fires across the face of goal and wide. 57 min: Mbeumo spins and fires over from 14 yards out for Brentford after receiving a pass from the left wing. 57 min: Swansea City free-kick, wide on the right. Hourihane’s delivery is over-hit and bounces wide of the far post. 53 min: Emiliano goes down after contesting a high ball with Conor Hourihane, who stands over the stricken Brentford goalscorer shouting angrily in his face. Replays confirm Emiliano shipped a blow to the back of the head and he’s fit to carry on after receiving medical treatment. 51 min: Some first half admin: EMiliano Marcondes was booked for something or other in the 22nd minute but I missed it a time of great goalscoring excitement. I mention it now because I won’t be hugely surprised if he gets a second yellow. In fact I will be astonished if both teams finish this game with 11 men on the pitch. 50 min: Jamal Lowe cuts inside from the wing, beats two defenders and sends his shot high and wide. Much better from Swansea but they’re still lacking composure. 48 min: That was a wonderful cross from Roberts, who was given the freedom of the right wing by Sergi Canos, who made no effort whatsoever to close him down. In the penalty arera, Pontus Jansson was stauesque as Andre Ayew beat him to the ball. Awful, awful defending from Brentford. 46 min: So close! Andre Ayew gets between defenders to head wide of the upright after connecting with a Connor Roberts cross from the right touchline. He should have scored!!! 46 min: Brentford kick off, with Swansea City hoping to become the only team to come from two down at half-time to win a Championship play-off final since Bolton Wanderers in 1995. No changes on either side yet. Some half-time reading ... Michael Appleton masterminded Lincoln City’s win over Sunderland in the League One play-off semi-final and should be barracked in the street for that act of heinousness. However, he is a very scary looking man, so do so at your peril. You can find out more about the Imps boss by reading this interview he did with Ben Fisher ahead of tomorrow’s final against his former side Blackpool. Peep! Brentford are on top after the opening 45 minutes, having opened their account with an Ivan Toney penalty, before making Swansea’s job a lot harder with an Emiliano Marcondaes strike to finish a blistering counter-attack. Swansea City are down but far from out – they’ve played reasonably well since going two behind. 45 min: Sergi Canos concedes a very cheap free-kick wide on the right not too far from the corner flag. Hourihane’s ball towards the far post bounces of the back of the leaping Andre Ayew, loops up in the air and bounces out of play off the cross-bar. Brentford keeper David Raya was very indecisive there. 44 min: Swansea press forward with Hourihane on the ball but he can find no way through the massed ranks of Brentford’s defence and ends up passing the ball backwards. 42 min: With so much at stake, this is a surprisingly open play-off final. The second half should be fantastic. 41 min: A kamikaze headed back-pass towards Woodman by Marc Guehi almost puts Mbeuma through on goal. Swansea recover and scramble the ball clear, but only just. 39 min: Oof! An attempted Mbeumo cross from the byline takes a deflection and loops up in the air, looks perilously like it might spin beneath the cross-bar and into the goal but goes out for a corner instead. Nothing comes of it. 38 min: Jay Fulton receives a pass in space outside the Brentford penalty area and tries his luck. His shot is blocked by Ethan Pinnock. 35 min: Following a period of frenetic first-half activity, there’s something of a lull. Swansea City have had more possession since conceding the second goal but have yet to give Brentford’s defence much to think about. 34 min: Another corner for Swansea, of course. Apologies! 33 min: Another corner for Brentford. Raya gathers this one at the far post. 32 min: Connor Roberts takes a long throw-in towards the Brentford penalty area, having been admonished by the refereee for trying to steal a few yards. Ethan Pinnock half-clears the ball but Swansea win a corner. Raya punches the inswinger clear. 30 min: Swansea City win a free-kick about 35 yards from the Brentford goal. Connor Roberts pings the ball into the penalty area, where Toney heads clear again. There’s a touch of the N’Golo Kantes about the Brentford striker - there appears to be two or three of him on the pitch. 28 min: Free-kick for Brentford, wide on the left. Mbeumo sends the ball towards the far post but a Pinnock foul on Ayew allows Swansea to clear their lines. 26 min: Swansea City desperately need to get a foothold in this game or they could be embarrassed. Steve Cooper has just changed his team formation to the 4-3-3 most expected them to line up in from the get-go. They had, until now, been mirroring Brentford’s 3-5-2. 23 min: Let’s go back to Brentford’s second goal. They broke up field at the speed of light after defending a Swans free-kick with Bryan Mbeumo on the ball. He played the pass to Mads Roerslev in the penalty area and the Dane picked out Emiliano up in support at the back post. Using a combination of precision and power, he fired inside the upright, giving Woodman little or no chance. 21 min: Swansea are in all sorts of bother. They almost concede a third as Ivan Toney catches the bouncing ball and hits a wonderful side-footed effort from just outside the penalty area off the bar. The ball bounces down on to the line and away from goal. That is a serious let-off for Swansea City. Brentford double their lead! Emiliano smashes home to finish a sensational counter-attack. 19 min: Swansea City free-kick, wide on the right. Connor Roberts swings the ball into the Brentford penalty area, where Ivan Toney heads it clear. 17 min: Advantage Brentford in these early stages, their players seeming to have settled better of the two teams due in no small part to that early goal. Swansea look rattled and have yet to offer anything in the way of a goal threat. 14 min: Swansea City right midfielder Jay Fulton goes in hard on Vitaly Janelt down by the touchline with his studs up, but escapes a booking from referee Chris Kavanagh. 13 min: Brentford free-kick, wide on the left. Pontus Jannsson curls the ball across the face of goal but nobody can get on the end of it. 11 min: Ivan Toney scores his 33rd goal of the season to put the Bees on top. Swansea’s defenders were caught ball-watching as Mbeumo nipped between them to dart on to a perferctly weighted through ball from Canos. Woodman dived at the striker’s feet but didn’t get near the ball and brought him down instead. Toney’s penalty was excellent, beating Woodman despite the goalkeeper guessing the right way and diving at full stretch. IVAN TONEY SCORES! He strokes the ball into the bottom left-hand corner to give Brentford the lead. Freddie Woodman brings down Bryan Mbeumo as the Brentford striker got between defenders to run on to a through ball. 7 min: Now Grimes needlessly pings the ball wide from deep, perhaps pondering his good luck in not getting sent off or his bad luck in being on a card already while playing in central midfield. He’ll have to watch his step. 6 min: Swansea City captain Matt Grimes gets booked for a nasty, reckless challenge on Sergi Canos. I think he’s very lucky not to get sent off for what looked a really wild lunge. 5 min: David Raya hacks the ball out for a Swansea City throw-in under pressure from their high press. 4 min: More Brentford pressurte and Kyle Naughton heads clear a cross from the right intended for Ivan Toney. 2 min: Mads Roerslav tries to steal in behind the Swansea defence and collect a throw-in at the byline. The ball sails out of play for a goal-kick. Now Swansea keeper Freddie Woodman gets his first touch . 2 min: Brentford goalkeeper David Raya gets an early touch, receiving the ball from a throw-in taken by Sergi Canos. 1 min: The ball is rolling in this play-off final with Swansea City doing the honours and despite having no dog in the fight I am a bag of nerves on behalf of all involved. Here’s hoping it’s a good one ... Not long now: The lucky 10,000 fans present erupt as the teams march out on to the Wembley sward led by their managers Steve Cooper and Thomas Frank. There are pensive faces everywhere to be seen on this grand occasion, with kick-off just a few minutes away. First, though ... the national anthems of the UK and Wales. Some pre-match punditry: “I never saw the Brentford I recognised in last year’s final,” says Sky Sports pundit Don Goodman, of the Bees’ defeat at the hands of Fulham last season. “That can’t happen again.” Twelve of today’s Brentford squad were involved in that final and it remains to be seen whether or not the experience will stand to them. Those teams: Thomas Frank names the same team that started the semi-final second leg against Barnsley, leaving Marcus Forss, who scored the late winner, on the bench. There had been talk he might come in for Bryan Mbeumo. Steve Cooper, makes one enforced change, with Connor Roberts replacing Wayne Routledge, who did his knee a serious mischief in their win over Barnsley. Good luck to him in his recovery. Brentford: Raya, Dalsgaard, Jansson, Pinnock, Roerslev, Jensen, Janelt, Canos, Marcondes, Toney, Mbeumo Subs: Daniels, Goode, Norgaard, Forss, Ghoddos, Reid, Fosu, Stevens, Bidstrup Swansea City: Woodman, Naughton, Cabango, Guehi, Bidwell, Fulton, Grimes, Hourihane, Ayew, Roberts, Lowe Subs: Hamer, Bennett, Latibeaudiere, Freeman, Manning, Smith, Dhanda, Whittaker, Cullen Today’s match officials Referee: Chris Kavanagh Assistant Referees: Daniel Cook and Sian Massey-Ellis Fourth Official: David Coote A reminder: there is no VAR in the play-off finals. Thomas Frank speaks ... “We are excited,” said the Brentford manager. “I was thinking about it driving home from training yesterday, that the atmosphere was calm and focused. There is that good focus with the understanding we are facing a Swansea team that has done a fantastic season. “We’ve played them twice, both 1-1 draws. Steve Cooper is one of the most talented managers in this country, and his experienced coaching staff, who have just performed and performed even better. It’s going to be unbelievably tight. That experience from last year will help in a way but it is not like we are suddenly 20 per cent better. It might help in the decisive moments.” “You saw in the game against Bournemouth how much the fans can help us; they had a massive impact on the result. We need the fans there to cheer us on throughout the game because this game will take twists and turns. We will all be a tiny bit more tense but that is a good thing. It is important that we do everything we can to be brave and make sure that we don’t regret anything when we look back. If we perform well, then we can’t do more.” Steve Cooper speaks “We want to get to the Premier League,” said Swansea’s manager. “There are two ways of doing it, either automatically or through the play-offs, and we have managed to give ourselves a chance of getting through the play-offs. It would mean everything. The club has been there before, quite some time before I was here, and that journey was a special one. “Then it was taken away through relegation, and you have to re-establish yourself and rebuild with a different identity. We have got to the last game of this season and given ourselves a 50-50 chance of winning - which is what a final is - and it is something we really have to go for. It would mean everything to the city, it would mean everything to the club and everyone is aware of that. “We talk about it at length, among the players and staff, and it is a massive motivation to get the job done. At the same time, we have to focus on the job at hand and what it takes to get it done; the performance, the mentality and winning the game. I can assure supporters we know exactly what it means, and it is our biggest motivation.” Early team news Long term absentees Shandon Baptiste and Josh Dasilva remain sidelined for Brentford, while left-back Rico Henry has been ruled out with a hamstring injury. The participation of central midfielder Christian Norgaard is in doubt after he pulled up lame in the warm-up ahead of his side’s semi-final second leg win over Bournemouth. Veteran winger Wayne Routledge misses out for Swansea City with a serious knee injury he suffered during their win over Barnsley. Out of contract at the end of June, he may have played his last game for the club. Central defender Brandon Cooper and midfielder Oli Cooper are also out. Very superstitious, but is the writing on the wall for Brentford? They will be wearing their customary home kit of red and white shirts, and black shorts today and will have to break something of a hoodoo if they are to win. No team wearing those colours has won a play-off final in their past 16 attempts to do so. Swansea, by contrast, have not lost while sporting the spearmint ensemble they’ll be trotting out in today. A highly prized place in the Premier League is up for grabs for whoever can prevail in today’s Championship play-off at Wembley. Always the bridesmaids, Brentford have contested nine different play-offs without success and are hoping to make it 10th time lucky as they bid to return to the top flight for the first time since 1947. Their opponents, Swansea City, last played in the top flight in 2017-18 but are slight underdogs today having finished seven points behind Brentford in the Championship table. Both league games contested by the side finished all square at 1-1 so today’s match may come down to a test of who can hold their nerve in a stressful game worth – apologies but we’re obliged to mention it – around £170m to the winners.","charCount":"17951","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/barryglendenning\">Barry Glendenning</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2021/may/29/sunday-feature-regarding-the-pain-of-others-allan-little-susan-sontag-review-1xtra-talks-with-richie-brave-assignment-lina-sinjab-syria","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-29T16:00:29Z","webTitle":"The week in audio: Sunday Feature; 1Xtra Talks With Richie Brave; Assignment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/may/29/sunday-feature-regarding-the-pain-of-others-allan-little-susan-sontag-review-1xtra-talks-with-richie-brave-assignment-lina-sinjab-syria","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2021/may/29/sunday-feature-regarding-the-pain-of-others-allan-little-susan-sontag-review-1xtra-talks-with-richie-brave-assignment-lina-sinjab-syria","fields":{"headline":"The week in audio: Sunday Feature; 1Xtra Talks With Richie Brave; Assignment","standfirst":"<p>A sombre week as BBC presenters pondered war reporting ethics, George Floyd’s death, and a decade of conflict in Syria</p>","trailText":"A sombre week as BBC presenters pondered war reporting ethics, George Floyd’s death, and a decade of conflict in Syria","byline":"Miranda Sawyer","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3e2a5bfc67a658a65fc430379582fefc7b6bcb9a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e2a5bfc67a658a65fc430379582fefc7b6bcb9a/0_386_5017_3010/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Susan Sontag’s essay Regarding the Pain of Others was dissected by Allan Little for Sunday Feature.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Susan Sontag’s essay Regarding the Pain of Others was dissected by Allan Little for Sunday Feature.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jean-Regis Roustan/Roger Viollet via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p><strong>Sunday Feature: Regarding the Pain of Others</strong> (BBC Radio 3) | <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000wkjm\">BBC Sounds</a> <br><strong>1Xtra Talks With Richie Brave</strong> (BBC 1Xtra) | <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p09jpzwc\">BBC Sounds</a><br><strong>Assignment</strong> (BBC World Service) | <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/w3ct1gxb\">BBC Sounds</a></p> <p>Today, on Radio 3’s <em>Sunday Feature</em>, the vastly experienced journalist Allan Little considers Susan Sontag’s 2003 essay <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000wkjm\">Regarding the Pain of Others</a></strong>. In the essay, Sontag wonders about the ethics of war journalism, particularly photography. Do pictures of the horrors of war engage the viewer or make us turn away?</p> <p>Little has spent decades reporting from places such as Sierra Leone and Bosnia. He met Sontag in Sarajevo (she was making a theatre piece – a previous Radio 3 documentary, <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m00022p1\">Afterwords</a></em>, discusses this); they drank whisky and became friendly. Little’s subject isn’t Sontag, however. Over 45 packed minutes he picks at the idea of war reporting being neutral, unframed “reality”, and also that such reporting might change the way the world works. He describes how he and other reporters are driven by the belief that “we could move people – we could move you listening now – to compassion and even action”. The US war correspondent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/dec/03/yours-for-probably-always-matha-gellhorn-letters-love-war-1930-1949-janet-somerville-review\">Martha Gellhorn</a> is quoted: “The idea [is] that the act of witnessing could end suffering.”</p> <p>Little talks to photographer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/nov/14/pakistan-women-alixandra-fazzina-conflict\">Alixandra Fazzina</a>, who often walks away from the frontline to look elsewhere. “Over the last 20, 30 years,” she says, “every image you find is of a screaming lady in a veil over a dead body… a man looking exhausted over a gun. These are images that have become cliches.” Zaina Erhaim, a journalist from Syria, describes how, even now, she is asked: “Who do you prefer – Assad or Isis?” “As if there is no 22 million people who have the right to something else,” she says.</p> <p>These dedicated and brave reporters are trying to tell us about human suffering, but they end up contributing to established biases. Professor Katie McLaughlin looked at past issues of <em>Vogue</em> in which <a href=\"https://www.iwm.org.uk/history/lee-millers-second-world-war\">Lee Miller’s war photographs</a> were published alongside fashion spreads. “These pieces are beautifully put together,” McLaughlin says. “The seamlessness of it… It was an ongoing aesthetic, and there’s something quite terrifying about that.”</p> <p>This was a deeply moral programme, fascinating and troubling. Is it possible to understand what it is like to live in a war zone? Can anyone understand if they haven’t been there, stayed there, lived their everyday lives under the threat of death? I remember <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sommervilletv/status/1360541262013726722\">Little’s report from 1991</a>, when the US air force bombed a shelter in Baghdad that housed more than 1,000 women and children. Some war photographers now take photos not in the belief that they will be published and change the world, but as evidence that could be used in a future prosecution for international war crimes.</p> <p>Last week, <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p09jpzwc\">1Xtra Talks With Richie Brave</a></strong> marked the anniversary of George Floyd’s murder. Hosts Brave, DJ and producer Seani B and podcaster Kelechi were reporting from a different frontline, one that white people – even now – can find hard to imagine. Some, in fact, find it so hard that they refuse to believe it exists. Brave read out a message from a troll, and answered it with snap and passion. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2bdb56e2773c0848b86d059f022ea47760b3f1b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2bdb56e2773c0848b86d059f022ea47760b3f1b/120_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Seani B.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Seani B.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Seani B, who won a Broadcasting Press Guild award for the searing show he did with DJ Ace last year in the immediate aftermath of the murder, described the complicated emotions he felt on winning. “What bothered me is that somebody had to lose their life for me to be even be considered for an award like that. I’ve been broadcasting in this building for 19 years… it had to take the pain of George Floyd’s family members for me to even be able to express myself, to even be heard.” Ray BLK sang What’s Goin’ On for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/may/20/whats-going-on-at-50-marvin-gaye-masterpiece-is-still-so-true-to-life\">50th anniversary</a> of the release of Marvin Gaye’s seminal LP of the same name.

Damascus is her home town, and her first programme, which went out last week, replayed her on-the-spot audio diaries, made in 2013 during her final days there. Assad supporters would take to the streets and march about chanting “Viva Assad” or “Burn the country down!” After a while, said Sinjab, they just shouted “Burn the country down”. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w3ct1gxb\">Last week’s episode</a> revisited Tim Whewell’s 2016 programme on the members of Aleppo’s Mare’a football team, who were once champions of their province.

Senior journalists are being forced to leave, and programmes such as <em>Assignment</em> and the vital <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p066rd9t\">Grenfell Tower Inquiry Podcast</a></em> may never exist in the same way again.

In the essay, Sontag wonders about the ethics of war journalism, particularly photography. Do pictures of the horrors of war engage the viewer or make us turn away? Little has spent decades reporting from places such as Sierra Leone and Bosnia. He met Sontag in Sarajevo (she was making a theatre piece – a previous Radio 3 documentary, Afterwords, discusses this); they drank whisky and became friendly. Little’s subject isn’t Sontag, however. Over 45 packed minutes he picks at the idea of war reporting being neutral, unframed “reality”, and also that such reporting might change the way the world works. He describes how he and other reporters are driven by the belief that “we could move people – we could move you listening now – to compassion and even action”. The US war correspondent Martha Gellhorn is quoted: “The idea [is] that the act of witnessing could end suffering.” Little talks to photographer Alixandra Fazzina, who often walks away from the frontline to look elsewhere. “Over the last 20, 30 years,” she says, “every image you find is of a screaming lady in a veil over a dead body… a man looking exhausted over a gun. These are images that have become cliches.” Zaina Erhaim, a journalist from Syria, describes how, even now, she is asked: “Who do you prefer – Assad or Isis?” “As if there is no 22 million people who have the right to something else,” she says. These dedicated and brave reporters are trying to tell us about human suffering, but they end up contributing to established biases. Professor Katie McLaughlin looked at past issues of Vogue in which Lee Miller’s war photographs were published alongside fashion spreads. “These pieces are beautifully put together,” McLaughlin says. “The seamlessness of it… It was an ongoing aesthetic, and there’s something quite terrifying about that.” This was a deeply moral programme, fascinating and troubling. Is it possible to understand what it is like to live in a war zone? Can anyone understand if they haven’t been there, stayed there, lived their everyday lives under the threat of death? I remember Little’s report from 1991, when the US air force bombed a shelter in Baghdad that housed more than 1,000 women and children. Some war photographers now take photos not in the belief that they will be published and change the world, but as evidence that could be used in a future prosecution for international war crimes. Last week, 1Xtra Talks With Richie Brave marked the anniversary of George Floyd’s murder. Hosts Brave, DJ and producer Seani B and podcaster Kelechi were reporting from a different frontline, one that white people – even now – can find hard to imagine. Some, in fact, find it so hard that they refuse to believe it exists. Brave read out a message from a troll, and answered it with snap and passion. Seani B, who won a Broadcasting Press Guild award for the searing show he did with DJ Ace last year in the immediate aftermath of the murder, described the complicated emotions he felt on winning. “What bothered me is that somebody had to lose their life for me to be even be considered for an award like that. I’ve been broadcasting in this building for 19 years… it had to take the pain of George Floyd’s family members for me to even be able to express myself, to even be heard.” Ray BLK sang What’s Goin’ On for the 50th anniversary of the release of Marvin Gaye’s seminal LP of the same name. She sang it beautifully. On the World Service’s Assignment, reporter Lina Sinjab has been looking back on a decade of conflict in Syria. Damascus is her home town, and her first programme, which went out last week, replayed her on-the-spot audio diaries, made in 2013 during her final days there. Assad supporters would take to the streets and march about chanting “Viva Assad” or “Burn the country down!” After a while, said Sinjab, they just shouted “Burn the country down”. Last week’s episode revisited Tim Whewell’s 2016 programme on the members of Aleppo’s Mare’a football team, who were once champions of their province. Unmissable. At the moment, BBC radio’s current affairs team is being cut to ribbons and rebranded as “longform audio”. Senior journalists are being forced to leave, and programmes such as Assignment and the vital Grenfell Tower Inquiry Podcast may never exist in the same way again. Even if an audience can’t work out the right reactions to such reporting, the BBC should continue to ensure these brave journalists, and the producers who support them, are able to keep doing their jobs. Three new shows with a twist The System Radio 4/BBC Sounds The twist of this new thriller, written by Ben Lewis, is partly the story, which is mysterious and addictive, but also its scheduling. Radio 4 has given over its Friday afternoon drama slot to a new strand of drama, Limelight. If you want to binge an entire series of Limelight, go to BBC Sounds, otherwise it will unfold week by week on 4. Forthcoming series include a real-life story about a house that vanished from the west coast of Ireland. The System is beautifully soundscaped, convincingly acted, and tackles an interesting topic: modern masculinity and how it can lead to fringe views. Cheat! Apple Podcasts Hosted by award-winning Vice reporter and former philosophy teacher Alzo Slade, this new series looks at, yes, you guessed it, cheating. Who cheats and why do they do it? The opening two episodes concern a group of seemingly upstanding Atlanta teachers. Unfortunately, they took their head’s succeed-at-all-costs approach to heart and ended up ensuring their students got good results by telling them the answers to questions. They wanted to help the pupils, who came from difficult backgrounds, and they did so. This is a story of race and class; compare and contrast with Felicity Huffman et al. No child left behind. All Day PopMaster Radio 2/BBC Sounds Tomorrow, Ken Bruce takes his quiz – for many, the very best part of his Radio 2 show – the beating heart, the USP – and turns it into a celebrity all-dayer.

Risk is probability multiplied by impact. Scientifically, we now have a very unfortunate set of data in front of us. We know that the likely impact on humans of climate disruption, mass extinction and air pollution is very, very high indeed. The probability is also uncomfortably high. This adds up to a very high risk. Now divide that by time. We have unequivocal evidence that we have entered a decisive decade. If we have any chance to prevent the loss of more than a million species, we must halt biodiversity loss now, not in 20 or 30 years. If we want to have any chance of keeping global warming to 1.5C, we need to cut emissions by half over the next nine years.

Slower flow of warm waters from south to north, can also explain why the southern ocean is warming so fast, which in turn has led to accelerated melting of the west Antarctic ice sheets.

In the five previous assessments, the IPCC estimated this range would be between 1.5C and 4.5C. In the sixth assessment that will be compacted. The higher point of 4.5C will remain, while the lower point will climb to 2.3C. This means we no longer have a range that goes from a manageable 1.5C to disastrous over 4C. Now the range is from very dangerous (above 2C, which can lead to a hothouse Earth) to catastrophic (over 4C).

Remarkably, this study shows that during this period, the world has not once passed 2C of warming – the hothouse Earth threshold that we postulated. It was not because of a gentle sun that the Earth remained in that temperature corridor, it was because of regulating feedbacks in the Earth system, such as ocean carbon uptake, terrestrial sinks, the <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-08467-z#:~:text=Introduction,snow%20and%20ice%20area1.\">albedo effect of the icecaps</a>, and so on. We want this new model to examine whether 2C of human-forced warming will push the Earth into a runaway hothouse state or whether it can land back into an equilibrium state similar to that of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jan/27/climate-crisis-world-now-at-its-hottest-for-12000-years\">Holocene period</a>.</p> <p><strong>How about evidence to the contrary? Are there studies that suggest we can avoid a </strong><strong>hothouse state?<br></strong>On the more positive side, the biggest unknown is how the oceans will behave. What we see in several of the model inter-comparisons coordinated by the <a href=\"https://www.wcrp-climate.org/\">World Climate Research programme</a> is that if we completely halt all greenhouse gas emissions, then the ocean will mop up the damage done to the climate system. That is under the assumption that ocean currents continue operating as now and that there are no further nasty surprises. It would come with very negative secondary effects: long-term ocean acidification, damage to marine life and perturbations of the heat conveyor belt in the ocean. Despite that, overall, I must admit I find it reassuring that the ocean might be able to continue buffering and ultimately clean up. But we urgently need more research on whether or not our planet can keep up its resilience and dampen warming or start self-amplifying warming.</p> <p>The second positive is that there is evidence that it is never worth giving up. Regardless of whether we can phase out fossil fuels fast enough to stay within a 1.5C increase, there is a benefit to doing everything we can. Even after a period of overshoot, of challenging decades of air pollutants and climate extremes, if we can completely phase out greenhouse emissions and go to zero carbon in an absolute sense, then we still have a chance to return within a Holocene-like state.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Tree-huggers and frontier activists are very important but they can’t tip this whole thing over by themselves</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>You have argued for a new approach in science communication to convey more urgency and agency. </strong><strong>In </strong><em><strong>Standing Up for a Sustainable World</strong></em><strong>, you urge </strong><strong>a </strong><strong>more positive message of prosperity and fairness that can attract an otherwise indifferent majority.

How important is this?<br></strong>David Attenborough is a prime example of what we need to see more widely in society. We need to see people in all walks of life, particularly those who are widely respected such as sports stars and musicians, to come out and say enough is enough. Attenborough has been the most important voice for nature in the world for two generations. Over the past five years, he has moved very drastically from love for nature to the need for planetary stability. This journey has taken him to a much stronger engagement with climate. He is an authoritative and trustworthy source for so many indifferent people. That really helps him get the message across. When he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jan/21/david-attenborough-tells-davos-the-garden-of-eden-is-no-more\">came to the World Economic Forum</a> in Davos for the first time a few years ago, he basically owned the place. His arrival on stage was the moment that made everyone willing to step onboard. It was remarkable.</p> <p>He also adds an extraordinary capacity to communicate and superb visualisation skills. It is a magic combination. Attenborough’s last film, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/sep/25/david-attenborough-a-life-on-our-planet-review-climate-emergency-documentary\">A Life on</a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/sep/25/david-attenborough-a-life-on-our-planet-review-climate-emergency-documentary\"> Our Planet</a>,</em> was the best nature documentary ever produced. We explore the science behind it in our new documentary, <em>Breaking Boundaries</em>. It is a very sustainable follow-up because Netflix and Silverback Films allowed us to use the footage that wasn’t included in the original series so we didn’t need to do any new nature shoots.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/11/greta-thunberg-schoolgirl-climate-change-warrior-some-people-can-let-things-go-i-cant\">Greta Thunberg</a> </strong><strong>is another key ally in this heightened communication effort. How close are you to her and how important is she – and other youth activists – as an interface between science and the public?<br></strong>What Greta has been able to do, along with the whole youth climate movement, including Adélaïde Charlier in Belgium Luisa Neubauer in Germany and Xiye Bastidea in Mexico – is to compel decision-makers around the world really listen to science.</p> <p>In 2018, when Fridays for Future held its first international demonstration in Berlin, I invited Greta to come to the Potsdam Institute to meet our scientists and have a closed-door seminar on the latest climate research. She immediately said yes and I sent an electric car to pick up her and Luisa. Since then, many in the scientific community are informally offering our knowledge to Fridays for Future. They are hungry to learn.</p> <p>I am in relatively frequent contact with Greta. I spoke to her this month. She had a session with the Swedish prime minister about a European green deal follow-up and wanted assessments. These are clever young people. Our exchanges are very informal. I do them because I think they are so fantastic and that they can make a real difference.</p> <p>We in the science community have a responsibility to communicate science. We need to be very active in the science-policy interface, the science-business interface and the science-society interface. Now is the time for science to step up. We should see the youth movement as fantastic proof of the transformation we are seeing right in front of our eyes right now. We scientists should surf along, not behind the backs of youth, but holding hands with them.</p> <p><strong>This informal coalition of science, youth and celebrity seems to be making a difference, at least in terms of public opinion. The leading US climatologist Michael Mann <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/feb/27/climatologist-michael-e-mann-doomism-climate-crisis-interview\">recently told me</a> the prospects for change are better now than at any time he can remember. </strong><strong>Do you share that sentiment?<br></strong>I can’t say this is the most optimistic I have been, but this is certainly a moment. It is like a ketchup bottle. You try and try to get something out and then suddenly a lot splurges out – 2021 is the year when lots come out.</p> <p>The biggest positive development right now is that the three biggest economies in the world – the US, China and the EU are aligning behind the scenes. The US and EU are committed to net zero emissions in 2050, and China by 2060, which is a bit too late but a start. This is due to Biden coming in. It will have a spill-over effect on the global economy. The three biggest economies are saying: “We are now at the beginning of the end of the fossil fuel era. We are going to cut emissions by half in a decade and reach net zero.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a0a546ade0d3553f1d8e2bfd854e98719c0c4b96\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a0a546ade0d3553f1d8e2bfd854e98719c0c4b96/0_228_4724_2835/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prof Johan Rockström, photographed at the Stockholm Resilience Center, part of Stockholm University.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prof Johan Rockström, photographed at the Stockholm Resilience Center, part of Stockholm University.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Hunt/Christopher Hunt / The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There was another unexpected blob of ketchup with the launch of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/apr/21/leading-finance-firms-sign-up-to-mark-carney-forum-on-low-carbon-investment\">net zero banking alliance</a> during Biden’s climate summit. It has taken a very long time to mobilise financial institutions behind a net zero pathway. Now we quite abruptly got it. This is important. They are the tap in the whole global economy. If you can get private banks, central banks and financial institutions on side, you can cut the flow of fossil fuel investment very fast.</p> <p>I am also encouraged by the race to decarbonise in the global car industry, which is nothing less than remarkable. Here in Germany, I sit on the sustainability advisory boards both for Daimler lorries and Mercedes-Benz cars. A few years ago, a chief executive would never participate in such meetings now he is here frequently because the key discussion in the company is how to accelerate to net zero. That is what we are seeing across industry. Agriculture is lagging behind, but the debate there is becoming more mature. I am not as optimistic as Mann, but we have shifted the narrative and it is much more aligned with what is needed, namely, that the sustainability across different industries, now is understood as the path to profits and business survival.</p> <p>Finally, what makes a person like me most enthusiastic is that we are finally understanding that landing the Paris agreement is not just about eradicating fossil fuels, but about remaining within planetary boundaries. We need to keep carbon sinks in nature intact. We need to take care of the nitrogen, water and phosphorus cycles. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cop26-glasgow-climate-change-conference-2021\">Cop26</a> in Glasgow should be the first major climate conference where the climate agenda and the nature agenda come together. Let’s see if that succeeds but many forces are trying to push it to that point.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This is quite a nervous moment. We have all those positives but we are still on a negative trend line.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That said, we are still on the wrong path. Bolsonaro is still cutting down the Amazon and we are still losing carbon sinks. This is quite a nervous moment. We have all those positives but we are still on a negative trend line. Which way will the world tip? But I agree with Mann insofar as we are at a point where the solutions are no longer seen as utopian fantasies but as scalable, replicable and achievable in one generation.</p> <p><strong>Can we trust net zero targets? They can serve as an excuse for inaction, as my colleague Damian Carrington and others have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/may/06/difference-real-climate-policy-greenwashing-emissions\">pointed out</a>. </strong><strong><br></strong>If we could get rid of the “net” in net zero, I’d be the first to throw it away. There are huge risks of misuse. The only reason why I, the IPCC and most other scientists accept net is there is no choice. There is no plausible chance of an absolute zero landing by 2050. There will be a residual of at least 5 gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent a year by 2050, due to methane fluxes, difficult-to-debate sectors, slow transitions in many developing countries and invested assets that cannot be completely stranded. So we need net. The question is how to deal with it. Rule one is that we must follow the carbon law, which means no compromises on cutting emissions of black carbon from fossil fuels by half every decade. That is the pace and that is non-negotiable. Everything under that curve should be offset with investments in nature-based solutions or different forms of offsetting. I argue we should aim for carbon neutrality today, not 2050. Many companies do this, by the way. Walmart tries to do that now.</p> <p>What is disturbing is when a company such as Shell puts out a scenario that it says is compatible with 1.5C and will reach net zero a few years after 2050. At first sight, Shell’s “Sky” scenario looks good, but scratch the surface and you see it is a seductive but completely incorrect analysis. It plans a very slow phase out of emissions, considerable overshoot and then a landing at zero emissions by 2070. It pushes this forward to 2058 by planting trees. That is an example of kicking the can down the road. This is not allowed. We have a responsibility to call out those who use “net” or “magic bullet” technological fixes such as carbon capture and storage and geoengineering to push emission reductions into the future. This has plagued discussion for too long. There has to be more independent and institutionalised ways of scrutinising this and holding commitments to account. We can’t allow nationally determined contributions at Cop26 to permit delayed phase outs with this net trick to slow emission reductions paths.</p> <p>But it is wrong to say nothing has changed. We scientists have been talking about 2050 for so long and the target year is actually approaching. And we are now pushing very hard for strong 2030 goals, which is just nine years away. We can still win.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81336476\">Breaking Boundaries – The Science of Our Planet </a></em><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81336476\">is on Netflix</a></p> <p><em>Jonathan Watts is the Guardian’s global environment editor and an unpaid contributor to the book that Rockström co-edited <a href=\"https://www.e-elgar.com/shop/gbp/standing-up-for-a-sustainable-world-9781800371774.html\">Standing Up for a Sustainable World</a>.</em></p>","newspaperPageNumber":"22","wordcount":"3164","commentCloseDate":"2021-06-27T23:00:00Z","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2021-05-29T16:00:29Z","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2021-05-29T16:00:29Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2021-05-30T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"The Observer","shortUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/p/hekm9","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/590ee043e470fc9ccec3f084fcdb4db4f2de8bef/472_599_4252_2551/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","isLive":"true","bodyText":"Johan Rockström is one of the world’s most influential Earth scientists. As director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, he advises governments, corporations and activists, including his Swedish compatriot, Greta Thunberg, about the latest research on the climate and biodiversity and argues for better science communication. Last year, he co-edited Standing Up for a Sustainable World, a book that brought together essays from climatologists, economists, environmental defenders, financiers and school strike activists. In recent months, he has teamed up with David Attenborough to create a new Netflix series, Breaking Boundaries: The Science of Our Planet, participated in President Joe Biden’s climate summit and co-organised a declaration by more than 100 Nobel laureates. The Nobel prize summit in April declared a planetary emergency. Why now? Scientists have known for at least three decades that human activity is destabilising the climate and accelerating the collapse of ecosystems. This statement, signed by 126 Nobel laureates, is a world record. Never before have we seen such a global uprising of Nobel prize winners. They issued an emergency call from science to humanity, calling for reason, truth and humanism in the transformation towards an equitable and prosperous future in a safe operating space. An emergency is calculated by risk divided by time. Risk is probability multiplied by impact. Scientifically, we now have a very unfortunate set of data in front of us. We know that the likely impact on humans of climate disruption, mass extinction and air pollution is very, very high indeed. The probability is also uncomfortably high. This adds up to a very high risk. Now divide that by time. We have unequivocal evidence that we have entered a decisive decade. If we have any chance to prevent the loss of more than a million species, we must halt biodiversity loss now, not in 20 or 30 years. If we want to have any chance of keeping global warming to 1.5C, we need to cut emissions by half over the next nine years. That is what the Nobel laureates and other scientists are speaking out about. This isn’t just a matter of raising the volume on the same old data - it is a new juncture. We are running out of time. In 2018, you co-authored the Hothouse Earth discussion paper, which warned that our planet could start drifting towards an uninhabitable state if warming exceeds the Paris Agreement target of 2 Celsius.. In the three years since, have you seen any evidence for this? My hypothesis still stands, though we have since seen new research that both strengthens and eases concerns. On the negative side, we have passed three important tipping points: Arctic summer ice, tropical coral reef systems and parts of the west Antarctic have, as far as the latest science shows, reached the point of no return. We are also seeing more evidence of a weakening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) an effect of ice melt from Greenland and the Arctic that reduces the salinity and temperature gradient between warmer salty water flowing north from the equator and colder less salty water in the north atlantic, which in turn slows ocean and atmospheric currents, with impacts on regional climate systems such as the Amazon monsoon. Slower flow of warm waters from south to north, can also explain why the southern ocean is warming so fast, which in turn has led to accelerated melting of the west Antarctic ice sheets. These cascades are a core feature of a potential drift to a hothouse Earth. We will see further support for our hypothesis in the forthcoming IPCC 6 (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) assessment, which for the first time will show a change in the climate sensitivity range (the amount of warming projected by computer models if humanity doubles the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere). In the five previous assessments, the IPCC estimated this range would be between 1.5C and 4.5C. In the sixth assessment that will be compacted. The higher point of 4.5C will remain, while the lower point will climb to 2.3C. This means we no longer have a range that goes from a manageable 1.5C to disastrous over 4C. Now the range is from very dangerous (above 2C, which can lead to a hothouse Earth) to catastrophic (over 4C). If we continue as we are, we are very unlikely to remain under 2C in 30 or 40 years. The third piece of negative new research comes from the new climate model at the Potsdam Institute, which is the first to reproduce the temperature and ice on Earth over the past 3m years. Remarkably, this study shows that during this period, the world has not once passed 2C of warming – the hothouse Earth threshold that we postulated. It was not because of a gentle sun that the Earth remained in that temperature corridor, it was because of regulating feedbacks in the Earth system, such as ocean carbon uptake, terrestrial sinks, the albedo effect of the icecaps, and so on. We want this new model to examine whether 2C of human-forced warming will push the Earth into a runaway hothouse state or whether it can land back into an equilibrium state similar to that of the Holocene period. How about evidence to the contrary? Are there studies that suggest we can avoid a hothouse state? On the more positive side, the biggest unknown is how the oceans will behave. What we see in several of the model inter-comparisons coordinated by the World Climate Research programme is that if we completely halt all greenhouse gas emissions, then the ocean will mop up the damage done to the climate system. That is under the assumption that ocean currents continue operating as now and that there are no further nasty surprises. It would come with very negative secondary effects: long-term ocean acidification, damage to marine life and perturbations of the heat conveyor belt in the ocean. Despite that, overall, I must admit I find it reassuring that the ocean might be able to continue buffering and ultimately clean up. But we urgently need more research on whether or not our planet can keep up its resilience and dampen warming or start self-amplifying warming. The second positive is that there is evidence that it is never worth giving up. Regardless of whether we can phase out fossil fuels fast enough to stay within a 1.5C increase, there is a benefit to doing everything we can. Even after a period of overshoot, of challenging decades of air pollutants and climate extremes, if we can completely phase out greenhouse emissions and go to zero carbon in an absolute sense, then we still have a chance to return within a Holocene-like state. You have argued for a new approach in science communication to convey more urgency and agency. In Standing Up for a Sustainable World, you urge a more positive message of prosperity and fairness that can attract an otherwise indifferent majority. How can this be achieved? After 50 years of trying to communicate risks, there is a rapidly rising recognition among environmental and Earth system scientists that we need to back off from an approach of just raising awareness and encouraging a willingness to pay. Indirectly, this creates a trade-off. People feel they have to choose between immediate wealth and protecting the planet. That is an obsolete and incorrect way of communicating. The indifferent majority will only come with us if the sustainable route is not just more attractive but easier. The moment we succeed is when people are sustainable without knowing it; they simply choose the right tomatoes because they taste better and they are cheaper. The counterargument is that more strident activism and a wider sense of alarm are getting the scientific message out more effectively than science has managed by itself. Talk of prosperity and equality is nice, but isn’t this more effective when reinforced by a fear of the likely consequences if we don’t change? Isn’t it necessary to see the abyss in order to step back so that fear is not paralysing but motivating? Yes, I’m on your side here. We have a responsibility to communicate the danger, the fear. As scientists, we have long tended to play down the risks. We confused society with sophisticated terms about uncertainty ranges and probability levels. Fridays for Future activists make the threat much clearer. All the cards need to be put on the table. The patient is sick and we must do a transparent diagnosis. We are clearly close to the point that can lead to disaster. A science based fear element is justified and important. Activism is a necessary force for change, but it can be counterproductive if the indifferent majority thinks everything to do with the environment is about barricades, breaking down the world order and an alternative lifestyle – that doesn’t attract the mainstream. We need all forces. Tree-huggers and frontier activists are very important but they can’t tip this whole thing over by themselves. We also need the bankers and executives. Why? Because we have only 10 years to cut emissions by half. We cannot change the economic model in 10 years. We can’t forbid everyone to do things in 10 years. We can’t re-educate whole populations in that time. We have to be very tactical. What is the role of the media and celebrities?

Attenborough’s last film, A Life on Our Planet, was the best nature documentary ever produced. We explore the science behind it in our new documentary, Breaking Boundaries. It is a very sustainable follow-up because Netflix and Silverback Films allowed us to use the footage that wasn’t included in the original series so we didn’t need to do any new nature shoots. Greta Thunberg is another key ally in this heightened communication effort. How close are you to her and how important is she – and other youth activists – as an interface between science and the public? What Greta has been able to do, along with the whole youth climate movement, including Adélaïde Charlier in Belgium Luisa Neubauer in Germany and Xiye Bastidea in Mexico – is to compel decision-makers around the world really listen to science.

Finally, what makes a person like me most enthusiastic is that we are finally understanding that landing the Paris agreement is not just about eradicating fossil fuels, but about remaining within planetary boundaries. We need to keep carbon sinks in nature intact. We need to take care of the nitrogen, water and phosphorus cycles. Cop26 in Glasgow should be the first major climate conference where the climate agenda and the nature agenda come together. Let’s see if that succeeds but many forces are trying to push it to that point. That said, we are still on the wrong path. Bolsonaro is still cutting down the Amazon and we are still losing carbon sinks. This is quite a nervous moment. We have all those positives but we are still on a negative trend line. Which way will the world tip? But I agree with Mann insofar as we are at a point where the solutions are no longer seen as utopian fantasies but as scalable, replicable and achievable in one generation. Can we trust net zero targets? They can serve as an excuse for inaction, as my colleague Damian Carrington and others have pointed out. If we could get rid of the “net” in net zero, I’d be the first to throw it away. There are huge risks of misuse. The only reason why I, the IPCC and most other scientists accept net is there is no choice. There is no plausible chance of an absolute zero landing by 2050. There will be a residual of at least 5 gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent a year by 2050, due to methane fluxes, difficult-to-debate sectors, slow transitions in many developing countries and invested assets that cannot be completely stranded. So we need net. The question is how to deal with it. Rule one is that we must follow the carbon law, which means no compromises on cutting emissions of black carbon from fossil fuels by half every decade. That is the pace and that is non-negotiable. Everything under that curve should be offset with investments in nature-based solutions or different forms of offsetting. I argue we should aim for carbon neutrality today, not 2050. Many companies do this, by the way. Walmart tries to do that now. What is disturbing is when a company such as Shell puts out a scenario that it says is compatible with 1.5C and will reach net zero a few years after 2050. At first sight, Shell’s “Sky” scenario looks good, but scratch the surface and you see it is a seductive but completely incorrect analysis. It plans a very slow phase out of emissions, considerable overshoot and then a landing at zero emissions by 2070. It pushes this forward to 2058 by planting trees. That is an example of kicking the can down the road. This is not allowed. We have a responsibility to call out those who use “net” or “magic bullet” technological fixes such as carbon capture and storage and geoengineering to push emission reductions into the future. This has plagued discussion for too long. There has to be more independent and institutionalised ways of scrutinising this and holding commitments to account. We can’t allow nationally determined contributions at Cop26 to permit delayed phase outs with this net trick to slow emission reductions paths. But it is wrong to say nothing has changed. We scientists have been talking about 2050 for so long and the target year is actually approaching. And we are now pushing very hard for strong 2030 goals, which is just nine years away. We can still win.

30s in <strong>England</strong> have received a coronavirus vaccine dose in a period of little over two weeks, new figures reveal. <br></p> <p>NHS England said that, since it began opening up the vaccine rollout to this age group on 13 May, about 53% of those aged 30 to 39 have been given at least one dose. <br></p> <p>Overall, more than 32 million people have been vaccinated with a first dose in England, almost three-quarters of the total adult population, while more than 20 million people have had both doses.</p> <p>People aged 30 to 31 were from Wednesday invited to get their jab, with more than 5m appointments made through the national booking service within 72 hours. <br></p> <p>The data comes as the NHS is asking people aged 50 and over, as well as those who are clinically vulnerable, to bring forward their second Covid-19 vaccination to help combat the spread of the B1.617.2 variant first identified in India. <br></p> <p>It follows the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) recommending earlier this month that the second dose interval be shortened from 12 weeks to eight for people in priority cohorts. <br></p> <p>NHS England said so far 600,000 people have been invited to rearrange their second jab through the national booking service, with around a quarter moving their appointment earlier. <br></p> <p>NHS England chief executive, <strong>Sir Simon Stevens,</strong> said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is remarkable that, in little over two weeks since people in their 30s began getting their invites, more than half have now had their first dose. <br></p> <p>This success is no happy accident but the result of months of careful planning and the sheer hard work and dedication of NHS staff. <br></p> <p>The Covid-19 vaccine is our most effective weapon against coronavirus and the best way of protecting yourself and loved ones, so, if you do one thing this bank holiday weekend, book your lifesaving jab and, crucially, if you’re contacted by the NHS to do so, bring forward your second dose of vital protection.</p> </blockquote> <p> Health secretary, <strong>Matt Hancock,</strong> said he was “absolutely thrilled” at the progress in the 30s age group and thanked those coming forward “to do their bit to defeat the virus”. <br></p> <p>He said: <br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As we enjoy the reopening of pubs and restaurants again, vaccines will play a crucial role in protecting us and those around us. <br></p> <p>Vaccines are the best way out of this pandemic and I urge everybody to take up the offer when eligible. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-05-29T12:51:42.032Z\">at 1.51pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div

Vietnam’s health minister Nguyen Thanh Long said on Saturday the country had detected a new variant of the coronavirus, which is a mix of the India and UK variants and spreads quickly by air, the online newspaper VnExpress reported. The World Health Organization has not yet responded to the finding. India has recorded the lowest number of new daily infections in 45 days, the Times of India reports, although a further 173,790 fresh cases were logged in the country on Saturday. Malaysia reported 9,020 new coronavirus cases on Saturday, the highest daily rise since the start of the pandemic. More than half of people in their 30s in England have received a coronavirus vaccine dose in a little over two weeks. Infections in Germany continue to fall, with the country’s seven-day incidence now at 37.5 nationwide, down from 39.8 on Friday and 66.8 in the previous week. Victoria state in Australia has recorded five new locally acquired cases of coronavirus – with four linked to a food distribution delivery driver – as the state enters its second day of its fourth lockdown. The southern Chinese city of Guangzhou shut down a neighbourhood and ordered its residents to stay at home on Saturday for door-to-door coronavirus testing following a fast rise in infections. Launching a Covid immunisation programme for children should be considered only in special circumstances, leading health experts have warned. A coronavirus surge sweeping through Thailand’s prisons has thrown the spotlight on the kingdom’s overcrowded penal system, where some inmates have less space to sleep than the inside of a coffin. Scotland’s health secretary, Humza Yousaf, said there was “significant community transmission” of coronavirus in hotspots in the city of Glasgow. Lebanon’s health authorities have launched a Covid-19 vaccination “marathon” to speed up inoculations around the country, including areas where turnout has been low. Spain will allow cruise ships to dock in its ports from 7 June, the transport ministry said on Saturday. That’s it from me, my colleague Nadeem Badshah will be taking over shortly. Prosecutors in several German regions have launched investigations of companies offering free Covid-19 tests after news reports said that some were padding their numbers to claim more money from the government. Prosecutors raided a company in the northwestern city of Bochum on Friday, according to the Suddeutsche Zeitung newspaper, while farther north in Luebeck, prosecutors have opened a fraud probe, the WirtschaftsWoche weekly said. In Cologne, authorities carried out a surprise control of a testing centre, and the city of Munster has revoked the license of a company that operates around 50 testing centres. In an effort to boost Covid-19 testing, the German government made testing free several weeks ago, reimbursing companies up to €18 ($22) for each test conducted. But according to a joint investigation by several media companies, the testing centres do not have to furnish any documents to prove how many people they’ve tested when filing for government compensation and several have been inflating the figures. “They just have to send the number of tests [carried out], without any proof, and they are wired the money soon after,” according to a joint investigation by NDR and WDR public television and Suddeutsche Zeitung. As part of the effort, journalists counted the number of people who had come into the testing centres and then compared these numbers to what the establishments submitted to the government to get reimbursed. According to the investigation, one centre declared 422 tests, when only around 100 people had come in. Another filed for reimbursement of 1,743 tests done in a single day, when only 550 people had come in. The number of places offering free Covid-19 tests have mushroomed since the government introduced the free scheme - in the North Rhine-Westphalia region there are currently nearly 8,000 and the capital Berlin has at least 1,200. Spain will allow cruise ships to dock in its ports from 7 June, the transport ministry said on Saturday, hoping to salvage the country’s battered tourism sector in time for the summer season. Reuters reports: Spain’s maritime authorities approved the reopening because of falling Covid-19 incidence rates and an increase in vaccinations, according to an order in Spain’s state gazette published on Saturday. Spain banned cruise ships from docking in its ports in June 2020 as the pandemic ripped through Europe. A number of high-profile spreader events were linked to cruise liners around the world. “Shipping companies will have to comply with measures established by the health ministry [...] to guarantee total security, both for cruise passengers and for the cities where they land,” the transport ministry tweeted on Saturday. It added that before the pandemic, Spain was the second most popular destination for international cruises in Europe. Spain, which was also the second most visited country in the world before the health crisis, was one of Europe’s worst-hit nations, recording over 79,000 coronavirus deaths and 3.7 million cases. Foreign tourism plunged 80% last year as a raft of restrictions brought the industry to a standstill. But with infection rates falling, vaccinations progressing, and most regions able to scrap curfews, Spain is looking towards reopening its vital tourism industry this summer. Last week Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez announced Spain would allow people from anywhere in the world to enter the country from 7 Jun, provided they were vaccinated. Tens of thousands of protesters have begun marching through central London in opposition to vaccine passports and coronavirus lockdowns. The anti-lockdown march, the latest in a series of large protests against the government’s coronavirus measures, began at 1pm in Parliament Square and made its way north to Oxford Street. Protesters chanted “freedom” and sang along to Bob Marley’s Three Little Birds as the they waved placards proclaiming slogans such as “we know where the rabbit hole ends”. The route of the march was not disclosed before it began. Activists at the front were directing the crowd via a series of coloured smoke signals. Louise Creffield, the founder of Save Our Rights UK, one of the groups behind the protest, told the Guardian the focus was on medical freedom. She said: We’re very concerned about the track and trace being turned into vaccine passports and the increase in mandated testing. We’re campaigning for a medical freedom bill which would prevent any coercion and any discrimination for not partaking in a medical procedure, because where there’s that there can’t be fair and informed consent. Once we lose our medical freedom there is no saying if and when we will get it back and where this slippery slope could take us. We’ve seen a huge amount of mission creep this year, so there’s no telling where it could go. In a Telegram post published the day before the protest, Save Our Rights UK said they planned to take the march on a different route to those in previous weeks. The post said: “This won’t be a scenic walk, we will be taking our message to community areas that we haven’t hit before and WE WILL BE STAYING AT THE END LOCATION AS LONG AS POSSIBLE.” Lebanon’s health authorities have launched a Covid-19 vaccination “marathon” to speed up inoculations around the country, including areas where turnout has so far been low. The Associated Press reports: The daylong campaign offered AstraZeneca vaccines at 30 different centers around the country without prior appointment to encourage people over age 30 to show up. The capital Beirut was not included in the campaign. A vaccination program that started in February targeted older age groups, primarily through registration on a government-operated platform and appointments. As of Saturday afternoon, 7,700 people had been vaccinated in the push. Pictures of lines outside centers north of Beirut showed turnout was high, particularly among foreign workers, many of whom had been reluctant or unable to register on the government-operated digital platform. There were also lines in towns and villages in the east and mountains, where turnout has so far been fickle. Lebanon has managed to curb the number of new virus cases since the start of the year. The small country, reeling from a crippling economic crisis that predated the pandemic, is eager to restore economic activities. Officials want to open up businesses and tourist attractions ahead of the summer season to draw in much needed foreign currency. So far, over 700,000 people have been vaccinated in the country of 6 million. More than 530,000 have been infected with over 7,700 deaths since February 2020. Restrictions in place since the start of 2021 have eased over the last few weeks, allowing restaurants, bars and malls to reopen and receive customers until late. “We are living many crises and our way to revive our economic life and restore some Lebanese social and culture norms forces us to think of greater ways for immunization in shorter periods,” Lebanon’s health minister Hamad Hassan told a local TV station. Launching a Covid immunisation programme for children should be considered only in special circumstances, leading health experts have warned. They say UK medical authorities, who are currently studying how vaccines for adolescents might be administered, should move with great care over the implementation of such a programme. They acknowledge it could help reduce outbreaks and the spread of Covid but also warn it could also raise important practical and ethical problems. Doctors would be giving vaccines for which there was limited information about possible side-effects to children who have nothing to gain from such a move, said Prof Adam Finn of Bristol University. “Children transmit Covid to some extent, although they rarely suffer badly from the disease themselves. If you offer them vaccines, then you put them at risk of possible side-effects – so there really needs to be some significant, tangible benefit to them, not just the indirect protection of adults from Covid-19.” The preparation of plans to give Covid vaccines to UK children comes in the wake of the US decision to launch such a programme and at a time when Germany has indicated it is planning a similar move. Canada and Switzerland have also approved plans, while the European Medicines Agency (EMA) last week agreed to extend approval for the use of the Pfizer vaccine on 12- to 15-year-olds. But the move to vaccinate children has been criticised by global health leaders, including the head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who earlier this month said that although he understood why some countries wanted to vaccinate children and adolescents, he urged them to reconsider. My colleague Robin McKie reports. More than half of people in their 30s in England have received a coronavirus vaccine dose in a period of little over two weeks, new figures reveal. NHS England said that, since it began opening up the vaccine rollout to this age group on 13 May, about 53% of those aged 30 to 39 have been given at least one dose. Overall, more than 32 million people have been vaccinated with a first dose in England, almost three-quarters of the total adult population, while more than 20 million people have had both doses. People aged 30 to 31 were from Wednesday invited to get their jab, with more than 5m appointments made through the national booking service within 72 hours. The data comes as the NHS is asking people aged 50 and over, as well as those who are clinically vulnerable, to bring forward their second Covid-19 vaccination to help combat the spread of the B1.617.2 variant first identified in India. It follows the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) recommending earlier this month that the second dose interval be shortened from 12 weeks to eight for people in priority cohorts. NHS England said so far 600,000 people have been invited to rearrange their second jab through the national booking service, with around a quarter moving their appointment earlier. NHS England chief executive, Sir Simon Stevens, said: It is remarkable that, in little over two weeks since people in their 30s began getting their invites, more than half have now had their first dose. This success is no happy accident but the result of months of careful planning and the sheer hard work and dedication of NHS staff. The Covid-19 vaccine is our most effective weapon against coronavirus and the best way of protecting yourself and loved ones, so, if you do one thing this bank holiday weekend, book your lifesaving jab and, crucially, if you’re contacted by the NHS to do so, bring forward your second dose of vital protection. Health secretary, Matt Hancock, said he was “absolutely thrilled” at the progress in the 30s age group and thanked those coming forward “to do their bit to defeat the virus”. He said: As we enjoy the reopening of pubs and restaurants again, vaccines will play a crucial role in protecting us and those around us. Vaccines are the best way out of this pandemic and I urge everybody to take up the offer when eligible. The Duchess of Cambridge has been given her first dose of a coronavirus vaccine. A message from the 39-year-old on the Kensington Palace Twitter account said: “Yesterday I received my first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine at London’s Science Museum. “I’m hugely grateful to everyone who is playing a part in the rollout – thank you for everything you are doing.” I’m Jedidajah Otte and will be taking back over now for the next few hours.

Launching a programme of Covid-19 immunisations for children should be considered only in special circumstances, leading health experts have warned. Offering vaccines to children – who “rarely suffer badly from the disease themselves” – could raise important practical and ethical problems, they said. Meanwhile, the head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also urged countries to reconsider vaccinating children when lower-income countries do not have enough doses to immunise vulnerable populations. In contrast, Klaus Okkenhaug, professor of immunology in the department of pathology at the University of Cambridge, said this morning that “it would of course help for children to be vaccinated because it also reduces their opportunities to transmit this virus to their teachers”. He added that although it was “a little bit of a fine balance because they are so unlikely to be affected by the virus”, he believes there’s “a good argument” for vaccinating over-12s, given the “phenomenal safety records” of some available vaccines. The organiser of the Edinburgh Fringe has said the world’s largest arts festival is “in danger” if the Scottish government does not ease social distancing rules for venues within a fortnight. Shona McCarthy, chief executive of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe Society, called on ministers to replace the current two-metre rule with the one-metre rule used in hospitality in order to help secure the future of the 75-year-old festival. McCarthy told the Times Scotland: “Within another two weeks, it’s going to be impossible for any [Edinburgh promoter] to put on anything. “There’s a real danger for the future of the Fringe. One year of no festival was manageable, and we were able to keep it in hearts and minds and everybody still held that space in their calendar, as that annual moment for reconnection and getting together. At two years, you jeopardise the solid space the Fringe has held for 75 years.” She urged the government to “have that leap of faith” and trust venues to deliver services safely in the same way as the hospitality sector. The UK government appears to have abandoned its “data not dates” principle, an expert advising its coronavirus response has warned, adding that its reluctance to delay unlocking was leading to “contradictory” messaging. Prof Stephen Reicher, a psychologist on the Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours (Spi-B), joined scientists warning against the final lifting of restrictions on 21 June as cases passed 4,000 for the first time since late March on Friday. Reicher said the government had invested “so much political capital” in particular dates that it has become difficult to diverge from them if the data suggests it is necessary. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I think we are in a pickle of the government’s own making at the moment. I think the reason for that is it has departed from its own mantra of ‘data not dates’. Very quickly ‘data not dates’ became ‘dates not data’.” Hello, this is Clea Skopeliti taking over the blog for the next hour while Jedidajah has a break. You can message me on Twitter if you’d like to draw my attention to a story. Thanks! Indonesia will introduce a “Work From Bali” programme for civil servants aimed at helping to revive the island’s battered economy. Bloomberg reports: The coordinating ministry for maritime and investment affairs will start with a pilot project in Nusa Dua, once a prime location for major conferences including the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in 2013, to encourage more meetings and outbound activities on the island. “We hope that with the arrival of government and state-owned company employees, the gears of Bali’s economy will start moving,” Hermin Esti Setyowati, an assistant deputy at the ministry, said in a statement on Saturday. Tourism-reliant Bali has been among the country’s hardest-hit provinces as borders remain shut, leaving its hotels and beaches empty. Its GDP shrank 9.9% in the first quarter from a year ago, following a 9.3% contraction for all of 2020. The island welcomed just 25 foreigners from January to March, compared with 1.1 million in the same period last year. The local government plans to accelerate its vaccination program with a goal of reaching herd immunity against Covid-19 by July, which could allow the island to reopen to international tourists. There is a “good argument” for vaccinating older children against Covid-19 given the safety records of some Covid vaccines, an expert has said. Klaus Okkenhaug, professor of immunology in the department of pathology at the University of Cambridge, told Times Radio that the decision on whether to give children coronavirus jabs was a “difficult question” that requires balancing wider benefits against the direct ones for children. He said: I think for a whole population it would of course help for children to be vaccinated because it also reduces their opportunities to transmit this virus to their teachers. Prof Okkenhaug said that when considering the “direct benefits to the children” it was “a little bit of a fine balance because they are so unlikely to be affected by the virus”. He added: But I think given the phenomenal safety records of some of the vaccines out there, there’s a good argument for going ahead at least with older children, say 12 and above. A coronavirus surge sweeping through Thailand’s prisons has thrown the spotlight on the kingdom’s overcrowded penal system, where some inmates have less space to sleep than the inside of a coffin. AFP reports: More than 22,000 people have tested positive inside jails, where inmates living cheek by jowl have been encouraged to keep wearing their masks even while they sleep. Authorities have floated plans to give early releases to prisoners with underlying medical conditions and have announced funding for more testing and medical care in recent days. But those behind bars say they have been kept in the dark about the seriousness of the outbreak. “Prisoners don’t have the knowledge to protect themselves,” said Somyot Prueksakasemsuk, a high-profile activist facing charges under Thailand’s harsh royal defamation law. Somyot was bailed last month and told AFP that he had not been tested for Covid-19 once during his 10-week stint in custody. He was not worried about contracting the disease while in jail because he had no idea about the level of risk. “But after this I’m so scared [for everyone still inside] ... if you are inside the prison you are at risk, it’s unavoidable,” he said. Thailand’s prison outbreak has skyrocketed from just 10 publicly announced cases a month ago and sparked growing public concern after a handful of prominent activists contracted the illness. Among them was student leader Panusaya “Rung” Sithijirawattanakul, who helped lead a series of rallies last year demanding political reforms in the kingdom, and who tested positive after she was released on bail. The Thai prison population stood at around 311,000 earlier this year, the International Federation for Human Rights said – more than two and a half times the system’s official capacity. Four inmates in every five are serving time for drug charges because of harsh anti-narcotics laws that can see offenders jailed for a decade for possessing just a few methamphetamine pills. Many cells are so packed with bodies that some inmates only have half a metre (less than 2ft) of space. “That is less room for a body than the inside of a coffin,” justice minister Somsak Thepsutin told local media in February. Officials have tested more than 36,000 inmates in recent weeks and begun delivering Covid vaccines to inmates and prison staff. Somsak said he was examining ways to give early releases to prisoners with underlying medical conditions, possibly through a royal pardon. Even if the plan goes ahead, prisoners will still have to complete a quarantine before returning home. India has recorded the lowest number of new daily infections in 45 days, the Times of India reports, although a further 173,790 fresh cases were logged in the country on Saturday. The official death toll climbed to 322,512 as a further 3,617 Covid fatalities recorded on Saturday, according to health ministry data. Daily recoveries continue to outnumber the daily new cases for the 16th consecutive day. A total of 2,080,048 samples were tested in the last 24 hours, according to the Indian Council of Medical Research. The governing civic body of Mumbai on Friday allowed walk-in vaccination for students who have been accepted for university courses abroad and require immunisation to travel. France’s budget deficit for 2021 will stand at €220bn, some €47bn higher than previously estimated, Olivier Dussopt, the public accounts minister, told AFP on Saturday. The increase is “a result of supporting measures that we’re continuing to take to support the recovery” from the devastating effects that Covid-19 shutdowns wreaked on the eurozone’s second-largest economy, he said. It is not yet clear how the revised numbers will affect the budget deficit when expressed as percentage of GDP, which was previously forecast to hit 9% this year, a postwar record. Public debt was previously forecast to reach 118% of GDP. The Covid-19 pandemic is expected to cost the French state nearly half a trillion euros over three years - €158bn in 2020, an expected €171bn in 2021 and a forecast €96bn in 2022, Dussopt said in April. France has borrowed heavily to try to keep the economy afloat through three nationwide lockdowns, including money spent on supporting salaries of people furloughed and aid for companies struggling to stay afloat during the crisis. The southern Chinese city of Guangzhou shut down a neighborhood and ordered its residents to stay home on Saturday for door-to-door coronavirus testing following an upsurge in infections. Guangzhou, a business and industrial centre of 15 million people north of Hong Hong, has reported 20 new infections over the past week. The number is small compared with India’s thousands of daily cases but has alarmed Chinese authorities who believed they had the virus under control. The spread of infections was “fast and strong,” the Global Times newspaper cited health authorities as saying. Saturday’s order to stay home applied to residents of five streets in Liwan district in the city centre. Outdoor markets, childcare centres and entertainment venues were closed. Indoor restaurant dining was prohibited, while grade schools were told to stop in-person tuition. People in parts of four nearby districts were ordered to limit outdoor activity. The city government earlier ordered testing of hundreds of thousands of residents following the initial infections. The government said some 700,000 people had been tested by Wednesday. China reports a handful of new cases every day but says almost all are believed to be people who were infected abroad, the Associated Press reports. The mainland’s official death toll stands at 4,636 out of 91,061 confirmed cases. On Saturday, the National Health Commission reported two new locally transmitted cases in Guangzhou and 14 in other parts of the country that it said came from abroad. Most of the latest infections in Guangzhou are believed to be linked to a 75-year-old woman who was found on 21 May to have the variant first identified in India, state media say. Most of the others attended a dinner with her or live together. That infection spread to the nearby city of Nanshan, where one new confirmed case and two asymptomatic cases were reported Saturday after people from Guangzhou were tested, according to the Global Times. Infections in Germany continue on a downward trend, according to the country’s Robert Koch Institute (RKI), with health authorities having reported 5,426 new cases within one day to the institute, down from 6,419 a week earlier. The seven-day incidence on Saturday morning stood at 37.5 nationwide, down from 39.8 on Friday and 66.8 in the previous week. Public holidays have, however, resulted in fewer people seeing a doctor, which means fewer samples are taken and fewer laboratory tests. Therefore, fewer new infections are reported. According to the RKI, 163 new deaths were recorded across Germany within 24 hours. A week ago 170 deaths from the virus were logged. The RKI has counted 3,675,296 Covid-19 infections since the beginning of the pandemic, but the actual total number is likely significantly higher, since many infections are not detected. The Philippines said on Saturday people were allowed to again go to work in Saudi Arabia, reversing a brief deployment ban after the kingdom said they would not be charged for Covid-19 tests and quarantine upon arrival. Reuters reports: “Our Saudi-bound workers will no longer be disadvantaged,” said labour secretary, Silvestre Bello. Flag carrier Philippine Airlines said it would accept Filipino workers on flights to Dammam and Riyadh, waiving rebooking fees for passengers who had been unable to board because of the deployment ban. Bello apologised for the “inconvenience and momentary anguish” caused by his Thursday ban, saying: “I understand that the suspension order drew confusion and irritation among our affected departing overseas Filipino workers.” More than a million Filipinos work in Saudi Arabia, the most preferred destination of overseas Filipino workers in 2019, government data shows. Many Filipinos are hired as construction workers, domestic helpers or nurses. In 2020, Filipinos in Saudi Arabia sent home $1.8bn in remittances, a key support for the consumption-led economy. With more than 1.2 million cases and 20,722 deaths, the Philippines has the second-highest Covid-19 infections and casualties in south-east Asia, behind Indonesia. People should be “very concerned” about the spread of the Indian variant of coronavirus, but “reassured” by the scale of the vaccine rollout, an expert has said. Professor Anthony Harnden, deputy chair of the UK’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), told BBC Breakfast that the variant was “clearly more transmissible”. He said: We need to be reassured that we’re in a very different position now in that we’ve got a highly vaccinated population and we just need to continue moving at speed. We do know that with this particular variant you do need two doses to offer complete protection, and so we’re very, very keen to make sure that all those, particularly higher risk groups, that’s the over-50s and those with underlying illness, receive their second vaccination as soon as feasible. The unlocking of society in England will be a “gradual process” that requires a “cautious” approach even if the government’s target date for removing all legal limits on social contact in the country on 21 June remains in place, he added, emphasising the need to “look very carefully” at what happens with the India variant in the next one or two weeks. He said: I think we need to look at that data very carefully before we completely un-lockdown. He suggested it was “better” to be on “the cautious side”, adding: Even if we do un-lockdown, if you are in a vulnerable position, particularly if you’ve not been vaccinated, you do need to carry on being cautious, even if the 21 June date goes ahead. So I think we’ve all got used to living within boundaries at the moment and I think it’s not an all or none, I think it will be a gradual process even if the 21 June date goes ahead. Scotland’s health secretary Humza Yousaf said there was “significant community transmission” of coronavirus in hotspots in the city of Glasgow. The city will remain under level 3 of Scotland’s restrictions until at least 5 June and Yousaf said urgent work was being carried out to understand the outbreak in south Glasgow and how the India variant arrived. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today: In a few concentrated hotspots ... we are seeing significant community transmission. The levels and the numbers of cases are continuing to rise. In other parts of the country “local health teams tell us they are relatively contained outbreaks” linked to either schools or domestic clusters, but that was not the case in Glasgow. What we are seeing is it’s coming in in areas where there is a large, diverse community so therefore there is a probability the variant has come in from international travel. Therefore we are trying to get to the bottom of how it managed to get in. Victoria state in Australia has recorded five new locally acquired cases of coronavirus, with four linked to a food distribution delivery driver, as the state enters its second day of its fourth lockdown. The update brings the total number of cases from the latest outbreak in Melbourne to 35. A record 56,624 tests were conducted in the 24 hours to Saturday morning, surpassing the previous day’s record of 47,462 tests. On Saturday, the state’s Covid testing commander, Jeroen Weimar, said four of the new cases were linked to a person who tested positive on Friday. The Victorian health minister, Martin Foley, said the person was a food distribution delivery driver who visited “multiple stores and grocery sites across metropolitan Melbourne on 18 and 19 May”. There are now more than 150 exposure sites and more than 15,000 primary and secondary contacts who must self-isolate after coming into potential contact with a person with Covid-19. Foley said the individual “worked during their infectious period” but they “showed no signs of Covid symptoms themselves”. He also thanked the food distribution company and customers for working with contact tracers. Weimar said four of the new cases announced on Saturday were household contacts of the delivery driver, including a student at Mount Ridley college in Craigieburn. He said these four people had only been in isolation for one day. The fifth case was separate, and was an employee of firm Stratton Finance who became infected at a display home in Mickleham. Late on Friday the Victorian health department announced new tier 1 exposure sites – where people are most at risk of catching and spreading the virus. A full list of exposure sites can be found here. Foley announced what he called a “hat-trick of records”, as the state administered a record number of tests and vaccinations over the past three days. Taiwan reported 486 new domestic Covid-19 cases on Saturday, including 166 cases added to the totals for recent days as it continues to readjust its infection numbers following delays in reporting positive tests. After successfully keeping coronavirus at bay, Taiwan is currently in the grip of its first serious outbreak. The island is desperately seeking vaccines to protect its people, and Taiwan’s neighbour China has offered to help, the BBC reported. Up until the mid-May, the country had logged only around 1,500 infections and 12 deaths, before cases began to rise sharply. On Tuesday, health minister Chen Shih-chung announced 2m vaccine doses would arrive in Taiwan in June, and 10m by the end of August. Russia reported 9,289 new Covid-19 cases on Saturday, including 3,241 in Moscow, taking the official national tally since the pandemic began to 5,053,748. The government coronavirus task force said 401 people had died of coronavirus-linked causes in the past 24 hours, pushing the national death toll to 120,807. The federal statistics agency has kept a separate count and has said Russia recorded around 250,000 deaths related to Covid-19 from April 2020 to March 2021. Malaysia reported 9,020 new coronavirus cases on Saturday, the highest daily toll since the start of the pandemic. This is the fifth straight day of record new infections, bringing the total number of cases in the country to 558,534. The country’s prime minister, Muhyiddin Yassin, has announced a nationwide “total lockdown” from 1 to 14 June that will apply to all social and economic areas, with only essential services and economic sectors listed by the national security council remaining in operation, ABC reports. “With the latest rise in daily cases showing a drastically upward trend, hospital capacity across the country to treat Covid-19 patients are becoming limited,” Muhyiddin said in a statement. Prof Stephen Reicher, a psychologist on the UK’s Sage sub-committee advising the government on behavioural science, said “confusion” over the government’s approach was undermining efforts to control the pandemic. Ahead of the planned 21 June easing of restrictions in England, he said the government was in a “pickle” because it appeared to have abandoned the “data, not dates” principle. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today: The data we are seeing at the moment suggests we have a problem. We don’t know how big the problem is - it might be bad, it might be very bad, we will learn in the next week or two. But the problem for the government is: on the one hand it can’t delay what it has been promising for so long, but on the other hand it is aware of the dangers of so doing. And so you see that in the fact that they are beginning to act in a rather contradictory way. They’re saying to us, for instance on travel: ‘you can travel internationally but please don’t’. They say of social contact ‘you can hug, but please don’t hug’. They say of restrictions, ‘no restrictions but please don’t go in and out of the hotspots’. That contradiction, that sense of confusion, I think is undermining the response. Hello and welcome to our global coronavirus live blog. Vietnam health minister Nguyen Thanh Long said on Saturday the country has detected a new variant of the coronavirus, which is a mix of the India and UK Covid-19 variants and spreads quickly by air, online newspaper VnExpress reported. Vietnam’s latest coronavirus wave, which began about a month ago, has seen 3,595 local Covid-19 cases so far in 33 cities and provinces. He said the coronavirus responsible for the new wave is much more transmissible, especially in the air. Viral cultures in the laboratory revealed that the virus replicated itself very quickly, he added, explaining why there are so many new cases in different locations in a shorter time frame. So far, Vietnam has recorded the presence of seven coronavirus variants, including ones from the UK, India and South Africa.

Caution is needed in determining whether England’s coronavirus restrictions can be lifted next month or “things will get bad very, very quickly”, a professor whose argument against herd immunity helped trigger the first lockdown has warned. Sir Tim Gowers, a professor of mathematics at the University of Cambridge, told the Guardian the downside of being “a bit more cautious” was a lot smaller than the downside of getting it wrong, as UK Covid cases rose by 4,184 on Friday – the highest increase since 1 April. Asked about the next step in lockdown easing in England, due on June 21, Prof Gowers said he did not believe the plans were necessarily at risk, but urged caution. He said: Because Boris Johnson has made a big thing about all the steps being irreversible, I think he’s put himself in a position where once he takes a step, he’ll be extremely reluctant to reverse because that would be a big U-turn, an embarrassing climbdown. So I think if that’s the way you’re going to play things, then you should be very, very cautious about every step you take ... And maybe everything [will] be OK, maybe the number of people who are vaccinated will be just enough ... ‘R’ will broadly speaking stay below one even with Indian variants. But if it’s not OK, we know, because of mathematics, that things will get bad very, very quickly. Or at least, maybe it won’t look that quick to start with, but it’ll grow exponentially. So it’ll pick up speed and become a big problem. Read my colleague Ben Quinn’s full story here. Prof Christina Pagel, a member of Independent Sage from University College London, said reopening should be delayed a few more months.","charCount":"39729","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/nadeembadshah\">Nadeem Badshah</a> (now), and <a href=\"profile/jedidajah-otte\">Jedidajah Otte</a> and <a href=\"profile/clea-skopeliti\">Clea Skopeliti</a> (earlier)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2021/may/29/brentford-promoted-to-premier-league-after-stinging-swansea-championship-play-off-final-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-29T15:55:36Z","webTitle":"Brentford promoted to Premier League for first time after stinging Swansea","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/may/29/brentford-promoted-to-premier-league-after-stinging-swansea-championship-play-off-final-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2021/may/29/brentford-promoted-to-premier-league-after-stinging-swansea-championship-play-off-final-report","fields":{"headline":"Brentford promoted to Premier League for first time after stinging Swansea","trailText":"Brentford will play in the top flight for the time in 74 years after beating Swansea City 2-0 in the Championship play-off final","byline":"Guardian sport","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"43973f92121c4b0ee693f647be6a9001218f8729\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/43973f92121c4b0ee693f647be6a9001218f8729/1_0_2270_1363/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ivan Toney and Brentford celebrate after going ahead from the penalty spot.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ivan Toney and Brentford celebrate after going ahead from the penalty spot.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kieran McManus/BPI/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Brentford will play in the top flight for the time in 74 years after beating Swansea City 2-0 in the Championship play-off final at Wembley.</p> <p>Thomas Frank’s side, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/aug/04/brentford-fulham-championship-play-off-final-match-report\">who lost to Fulham in last year’s final</a>, made a spectacular start to ensure there would be no repeat of that traumatic defeat.

Keaton Jennings was the master builder, crafting his first red-ball century since he made 146 not out for England against Sri Lanka in November 2018. After a couple of years in the wilderness, this season he has rediscovered both touch and brio. Away he chugged, putting on 19 runs in the first 45 minutes with Luke Wells, but there were occasional boulders as well as bricks, as skimming cover drives and gleaming late cuts were plucked from the level.</p> <p><strong>Yorkshire</strong> plugged away, throwing on Dom Bess, his baggy trousers and shaggy hair a sharp contrast to Jennings’ ironed creases and buttoned cuffs. Yorkshire eventually got their hands on the new ball they had been after all day, and it tookonly five overs to make a breakthrough as Jennings was caught at first slip after a partnership of 175 with Wells. One became three as Wells, then Livingstone followed. But on Lancashire went. For a while it seemed they would try for maximum batting bonus points as Dane Vilas straight drove Steven Patterson for four, then dropped to one knee and pulled him behind square, and Bess was biffed for straight sixes, with Josh Bohannon reaching the scorers’ box high in the media centre. But sense soon prevailed and the grind, grind, grind returned.</p> <p>A sixth wicket stand of 125 between Ryan ten Doeschate (55) and Adam Wheater (81) rescued <strong>Essex</strong> from an unbecoming 53 for five to finish the day with a towering lead at Chester-le-Street. <strong>Durham </strong>were earlier bowled out for 99; such was the haste of their demise that Simon Harmer didn’t even get to wrap his bowling fingers around the ball.</p> <p>Saif Zaib’s 64 helped <strong>Northants</strong> to a handy first-innings lead at Hove.

And Hammond finds himself back at the crease again. And at OT, Parky has taken his rightful place at the James Anderson End, a hanky hanging out of his waistband. There have been four singles in the last 91 balls.... Fantastic generosity from Lancashire, the scoreboard has given Yorkshire six points. Sun out, short shadows, Lyth 16, KC 15. “Hi Tanya. “Hello Richard Hirst “The teatime scores show close to symmetry between the Oval and Old Trafford. As a Surrey supporter from Yorkshire stock (and therefore anti-Yorkshire for cricket purposes) I’m delighted by both scores.” I wonder if symmetry in numbers appeals to everyone in the same way as symmetry in the face? Yes, the scoreboard is working at Old Trafford, its just that Yorkshire have retreated into their spiky shells. Vilas has reverted to pace with Lamb and Wood and Lyth and Kohler-Cadmore defend. Fatly pleased to see Dillon Pennington’s 4-44 in Derbyshire’s first-innings, followed by the first wicket of Derbys’s second innings. Have been waiting for him to have a breakthrough match ever since watching him against Surrey at New Road in September 2018. Group One Riverside: Durham 99 all out and 126-3 v Essex 182 all out and 301 Durham need 259 to win Edgbaston: Warwickshire 341 all out and 95-1 v Nottinghamshire 297 New Road: Worcestershire 421 all out v Derbyshire 270 and 16-1 Group Two Grace Road: Leicestershire 136 v Middlesex 295 and 204-8 The Oval: Surrey 473 all out v Gloucestershire 158 and 28-0 Group Three Old Trafford: Lancashire 509-9dec v Yorkshire 159 and 28-0. Hove: Sussex 175 and 298 v Northants 256 and 35-1 Northants need 183 to win Ah. Vilas has plumped for a bit of Livingstone for the last over before tea. Will it be the spin twins twirling and gurning throughout the final session? Lyth and Kohler-Cadmore have negotiated this first part of their second innings with aplomb. Yorkshire 28-0, Lyth 15; KC 12. Tea scores to follow. Derby following on at Worcester; Gloucestershire following on at The Oval. And Northants need another 194 to win at Hove, they’ve already lost Ben Curran for 10. Poor Curran, averaging 14 this season in his seven games. Not a bad record. By the way, Parky is on. Middlesex suffering a scuttle of wickets, losing three for five, including Handscomb for 36. Chris Wright 5-43. And Gloucestershire too are in deep trouble. Daniel Moriarty 5-56; Amar Virdi 3-46. Gloucestershire 158-9, no, make that 158 all out. Miles Hammond last man out for 77. They must gear up again, following-on, 315 behind. Durham lose a third wicket - 104-3 - a much better effort than the first innings, but too many wickets gone, too early in the day. The bowler, ten Doeschate, the batsman Lees. 281 more needed to win. Oh, Ben Brown! Sussex now 298-9, with him 95 not out - NO - make that 95 OUT! Sussex 298, five wickets for Simon Kerrigan (horray!). Northants need 217 to win. Would it be rude to suggest that laid-back Yorkshire look in no trouble at all? A fantastic rear-guard display by Sussex led by a century from Tom Haines and a nearly-ton from Ben Brown, who is 95 not out. Sussex 298-8, a lead of 216. Saqib Mahmood does a series of bouncy tuck jumps at the top of his long, long, run. That’s just showing off. OOoof, Lyth cuts, past a diving Danny Lamb at gully. A slightly risky air to that shot. Tom Bailey stands tall at the top of his run, quick and smooth. After one over, Yorkshire are 1-0 and everything suddenly has urgency and energy. This is the fourth time Lancashire have passed 500 in Roses matches and, remarkably, their second 509-9 declared . The first, I know you’ll want to know, came in 1926. 47 overs of the day left. Mahmood is run out for 0 and Lancs declare. A lovely gesture by Patterson, who shakes Bohannon’s hand and then signals to his players to let Bohannon walk back first, 127 not out, and they all clap him off. The groundsman drapes the crease in a black cloth, a funereal spectre of things to come. They’re back on at Edgbaston, Warwickshire pocketing a 44-run first-innings lead. And they’re stepping on it, at OT. Declaration not far away. Tom Bailey slams Hill into the empty seats of the party stand... oh, ... and he’s been bowled trying to whallop a repeat shot. Lancashire 506-8 Dom Bess gets a consolation wicket, Lamb for 61, but the Lancashire declaration doesn’t come. We’re not sure what they’re waiting for - 500? Another Chester-le-Street lbw - this time Scott Borthwick to Sam Cook for 29. Durham 53-2 and the pitch misbehaving. Notts all out at Edgbaston, but they’ve done well to pull themselves to within 44 of Warwickshire’s first innings. . Derbyshire have lost Hudson-Prentice for 25, Critchley hanging on for 61. Hammond still there at The Oval, on 61, but Gloucestershire are in rather a hole, now 129-7, 343 behind. And that’s the hundred! A first Roses hundred, the second first-class ton of his career, off 260 balls, ten fours and a six. He punches the air, whips off his helmet and raises his bat to his whooping teammates and, round the ground, to the clapping crowd. A cracking innings, slow, quick, quick, slow, which has taken Lancashire to an utterly dominant position. Nervous 99s for Bohannon.... And a great preview of the New Zealand series, which starts on Wednesday! No jacket required at lunch at Old Trafford. On my turn of the ground I saw a couple of 99’s gingerly making their way back to their seats, a man in an MCC blazer and matching face mask, and a good handful of children. Here are the Grahams, enjoying a family outing at OT for the first time post lockdown (though Peter has been here every day the match). Happy Birthday for Monday Kian and Zavi! Seat banging and mucho applause as Danny Lamb reaches his fifty with a single off Danny Brook. Off a 142 balls in a vital seventh-wicket partnership as Yorkshire just wait for the trials ahead. An email pops up from Andrew Benton: “Every time I see your name I connect in my head to a film called Ptang Yang Kipperbang, which was on Channel 4 soon after it started broadcasting (40-odd years ago now). I saw it then, as a lad, then forgot about it. Finally I checked it out and am reminded it’s about cricket (!) and more, with John Arlott providing a commentary on the adolescent protagonists life. Perhaps recommended viewing for non-match days (or the Hundred, if that flops!)“ Thank you Andrew! A lovely interview by Kevin Howells with Vic Marks on the radio now. Group One Riverside: Durham 99 all out and 47-1 v Essex 182 all out and 301 Edgbaston: Warwickshire 341 all out v Nottinghamshire 274-8 New Road: Worcestershire 421 all out v Derbyshire 193-5 Group Two Grace Road: Leicestershire 136 v Middlesex 295 and 125-4 The Oval: Surrey 473 all out v Gloucestershire 113-6 Group Three Old Trafford: Lancashire 439-6 v Yorkshire 159 all out Hove: Sussex 175 all out and 241-7 v Northants 256 all out And that is lunch, as a weary Yorkshire dawdle off the field. The Lancashire lead, 280. Scores to follow. Emma Lamb has reached her hundred, 107 not out, against Western Storm; Peter Handsomb and John Simpson at the crease for Middlesex, who have lost three this morning, but have a healthy padding of 284 over Leicestershire With an over to go, Bohannon needs another eight for his century, Danny Lamb ten for his fifty. Lancs 439-6. A third wicket to Simon Kerrigan at Hove- Tom Haines out for a marvellous 103. And Gloucestershire in deep trouble at The Oval! Brathwaited 38, Hammond 44 not out, but a sorry tale otherwise of noughts and ones as the spinners weave their web : three for Virdi, two for Moriarty. Hammond not out 44 and Tattersall, on loan from Yorkshire, one. And, according to the commentators, the pitch isn’t even spinning yet. If anyone is interested, these were the thoughts of Steven Patterson yesterday. Incidentally, we think that if Derbyshire make 200, Yorkshire will have the lowest number of batting points in the country. “It was an horrendous start for us (with the bat). But fair play to them, they’ve played good cricket throughout and have not let us back in the game. We now find ourselves right up against it. “I thought Keaton Jennings and Luke Wells showed us, in a sense, how to bat on a good surface. When you get the opportunity, make it count. “They didn’t score at a particularly quick rate at any stage, but they made it hard work for us and ground us down. “I can’t question the lads character and effort today. It’s a good surface and hard to get wickets on. “To go at two and a half an over for the first 120 overs is a good effort and a testament to the bowlers skills. But, at the end of the day, we can’t keep expecting the bowlers to pull us out of trouble.” Happy to see Barnard and Pennington in the wickets at New Road - Derby in a bit of pickle at 148-5. Not to worry Yorkshire, but Dom Bess is just starting to find a bit of a twist on the pitch. Notts continuing to bleed wickets, now 237-7, but Sussex are on a roll. Tom Haines 94 not out, Ben Brown 54 not out. A partnership of 96 which has given Sussex a sniff of a chance of fighting for a place in Division One. Their lead over Northants, 114. Thanks to Romeo for pointing out that I’d filed some absolute gibberish about live streams (he was a lot more polite!). I’ll try again: Some amazing live stream data: on day one of the Roses match, Lancashire picked up 159,000 hits via facebook and youtube, and 153,000 on day two. This is compared with an average of 150,000 over a four day match. Plus more watching on Sky. The Roses, it seems, still captures the imagination. Durham, I’m afraid to report, have lost their first wicket on their quest to make large number of runs to win. Cameron Bancroft bowled by Jamie Porter for four. Durham 9-1. Tim Bresnan pockets Joe Clarke for 61 as Nottinghamshire reach 218-5. Danny Lamb (23 not out) is not the only member of his family batting today, his sister Emma is 55 not out for Thunder against Western Storm. Essex’s innings has disintegrated with a familiar flow: another bowled and another lbw, both to Ben Raine, who finishes with 5-64. Durham need 385 to win, with five and a half sessions to get them. Aha. Some amazing live stream data: on day one of the Roses match, Lancashire picked up 159,000 hits, and 153,000 on day two. This is compared with an average of 150,000 over a four day match. Plus more watching on Sky. The Roses, it seems, still captures the imagination. And a gorgeous straight drive from Bohannon off Olivier, pushes Lancashire towards 400. Bohannon’s fifty came at last - 149 balls, seven fours, 1 six - he’s a real block or biff it boy. And I should probably mention, for those of you not watching the live streams, that the players are still taking regular sanitisation breaks. Notts have just lost their first wicket,Lyndon James for four, and Joe Clarke has passed his fourth fifty of the season. Notts 202-4. Here, we’re still waiting for Josh Bohannon to get the two runs to reach his fifty. Voices in the press box saying: “Bohannon for England!” A slow start here, a bit of prodding and poking with a fair scattering of members on an almost humid day. Some cracking reads in the paper today: and one that I KNOW will appeal to County Blog readers: Good morning! It’s the last Saturday in May and county cricket is in bloom everywhere. Some tight games today, results could flourish at Hove and Chester-le-Street ,while Lancashire, Surrey and Middlesex will tighten the screw. Keep an eye too on the Rachael Heyhoe Flint Trophy, which starts today. This year, its second, consists of eight-teams (Central Sparks, South East Stars, Northern Diamonds, Western Storm, Sunrisers , Thunder, Southern Vipers and Loughborough Lightening) playing in a 50-over competition. Lastly, apologies for the slight delay to the blog - the dog rolled in something disgusting. Group One Riverside: Durham 99 all out v Essex 182 all out and 263-8 Edgbaston: Warwickshire 341 all out v Nottinghamshire 173-3 New Road: Worcestershire 421 all out v Derbyshire 91-3 Group Two Grace Road: Leicestershire 136 v Middlesex 295 and 57-1 The Oval: Surrey 473 all out v Gloucestershire 45-1 Group Three Old Trafford: Lancashire 350-6 v Yorkshire 159 all out Hove: Sussex 175 all out and 142-4 v Northants 256 all out On a traditionally overcast Roses Friday, the day meandered towards a crushing Lancashire lead. Keaton Jennings was the master builder, crafting his first red-ball century since he made 146 not out for England against Sri Lanka in November 2018. After a couple of years in the wilderness, this season he has rediscovered both touch and brio. Away he chugged, putting on 19 runs in the first 45 minutes with Luke Wells, but there were occasional boulders as well as bricks, as skimming cover drives and gleaming late cuts were plucked from the level. Yorkshire plugged away, throwing on Dom Bess, his baggy trousers and shaggy hair a sharp contrast to Jennings’ ironed creases and buttoned cuffs. Yorkshire eventually got their hands on the new ball they had been after all day, and it tookonly five overs to make a breakthrough as Jennings was caught at first slip after a partnership of 175 with Wells. One became three as Wells, then Livingstone followed. But on Lancashire went. For a while it seemed they would try for maximum batting bonus points as Dane Vilas straight drove Steven Patterson for four, then dropped to one knee and pulled him behind square, and Bess was biffed for straight sixes, with Josh Bohannon reaching the scorers’ box high in the media centre. But sense soon prevailed and the grind, grind, grind returned. A sixth wicket stand of 125 between Ryan ten Doeschate (55) and Adam Wheater (81) rescued Essex from an unbecoming 53 for five to finish the day with a towering lead at Chester-le-Street. Durham were earlier bowled out for 99; such was the haste of their demise that Simon Harmer didn’t even get to wrap his bowling fingers around the ball. Saif Zaib’s 64 helped Northants to a handy first-innings lead at Hove. After a post-tea wobble, Tom Haines and Ben Brown inched Sussex ahead. Lewis Hill and Callum Parkinson were the only players to make their mark on Leicestershire’s first innings of 136. Martin Andersson was too much for their middle order, picking up four for 27, his best figures for Middlesex. Hashim Amla continued to scatter his munificence at The Oval, finishing with 173, and Surrey 473, thanks to a bit of hurry-up from Rikki Clarke and Sean Abbott. Gloucestershire must now bat out two days on a turning pitch, with Amar Virdi already in the wickets shortly before rain stopped play. A last wicket can-can of 52 for Warwickshire between Liam Norwell and Oliver Hannon-Dalby proved a morning irritation to Nottinghamshire on a day interrupted by showers. Norwell, who had frying-panned three sixes, then nipped in to remove England-bound Haseeb Hameed for 39, Ben Duckett and, later, Ben Slater for 77. Ed Barnard coaxed the tail into a morning wag with another handy innings, this time of 90, as Worcestershire reached 421. On a rain-interrupted afternoon, Derbyshire lost three wickets.","charCount":"15270","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/tanyaaldred\">Tanya Aldred</a> at Old Trafford"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2021/may/29/harlequins-bath-premiership-rugby-union-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-29T15:29:30Z","webTitle":"Martin Landajo seals Harlequins win over Bath and semi-final place","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/may/29/harlequins-bath-premiership-rugby-union-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2021/may/29/harlequins-bath-premiership-rugby-union-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Martin Landajo seals Harlequins win over Bath and semi-final place","standfirst":"<ul><li>Harlequins 44-33 Bath</li><li>Quins bonus-point takes them out of reach of chasing pack</li></ul>","trailText":"Harlequins secured their place in the Gallagher Premiership play-off semi-finals with a breathless 44-33 victory over Bath at the Twickenham Stoop","byline":"Michael Aylwin at the Twickenham Stoop","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"800a3339fb91d79cce5ce2d2d0c1b258e1fb6a26\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/800a3339fb91d79cce5ce2d2d0c1b258e1fb6a26/0_38_4482_2690/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Luke Northmore of Harlequins is congratulated after scoring his side’s fourth try.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Luke Northmore of Harlequins is congratulated after scoring his side’s fourth try.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Davidson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>We have our semi-finalists - but we so nearly didn’t.

The record will state that Quins took the bonus-point win that takes them beyond the reach of the chasing pack, but they did their best to keep the door open, Bath registering two bonus points of their own and holding the lead against all odds up to the hour. Truth be told, though, Quins could afford to be lax. That pack stopped chasing a while ago. Now the race, bar that for Europe, or the top eight, in which Bath are very much invested, narrows to one for the two home semi-final spots. Bristol are one win away from securing one of those, but Sale and Quins will be lurking for the other, should Exeter slip up in the final couple of rounds. Quins will relish their six tries – and rightly so – Jack Kenningham setting them on their way in the fifth minute, and further scores, most breathless and brilliant, by Danny Care, Joe Marchant, Luke Morthmore, Stephan Lewies and Martin Landajo. But there is a fault line that runs through them. Marcus Smith, superb as ever with ball in hand, missed six kicks at goal, including three simple penalties in the second half that might have sealed the win before Landajo’s try late on. Bath’s tries were fabulous too, Josh McNally’s opener showcasing outrageous athleticism for a lock. They came back twice to take the lead midway through each half. This felt like a typically wild occasion at the Stoop. If ever a club were made for this sort of assignment, it is Quins. The sun was out, the opposition game, and – glory be – enough adoring fans were present to make some proper noise.

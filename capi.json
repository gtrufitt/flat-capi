Experts said a lack of shots, coupled with misinformation about vaccines, had led millions of Brazilians to only take one dose so far. A lack of chemical ingredients, mainly delivered from China, has caused Brazil’s two main vaccine production hubs, Fiocruz and the Butantan institute in Sao Paulo, to temporarily pause production of their respective shots. Fiocruz is making the AstraZeneca PLC vaccine, while Butantan is manufacturing a shot developed by China’s Sinovac Biotech Ltd. Carlos Lula, president of the National Council of Health Secretaries (Conass), said about 5 million people had so far not shown up to take their second dose. “Conass is talking to the Health Ministry and seeing what we can do to speed up vaccinations,” he told Reuters. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60b680f58f08b9889b365de4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-01T19:00:16.184Z\">8.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Coachella music festival will return to the <strong>US </strong>in April 2022, organisers have announced.</p> <p>The 2020 event was scheduled for April of that year before being pushed to October.<br></p> <p>It was then moved to April 2021 before again being cancelled due to the health crisis.</p> <p>However promoter Goldenvoice has now confirmed Coachella will return over two weekends next year in California - April 15-17 and April 22-24.</p> <p>Advance ticket sales begin on Friday, organisers added.</p> <p>The Stagecoach music festival, a country music event scheduled for April on the same site as Coachella, is also making its return.</p> <p>It is scheduled to take place over April 29-May 1. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60b67fc48f082e80569f32c5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-01T18:48:17.626Z\">7.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>New infection control guidance to help keep NHS workers safe from Covid-19 “falls short”, leading nurses in the <strong>UK </strong>said. <br> The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) said that the updated official Covid-19 infection prevention and control guidance “focuses too much on aerosol generating procedures as the main risk”.

A key quality is that they resist change: they attempt to fix for us an abiding sense of what exactly has happened. They can be many things: columns, tombs, plaques, cenotaphs, village halls, even housing. But who are they for? The people who suffered, their families, the wider public or future generations?</p> <p>At some point, inevitably, there will be an official, national memorial of the pandemic in the UK (as well as many more, surely, at local and international levels). What, then, should it look like? It will have to contend with how messy the past year has been – the death, the sorrow, the fear, but also the ensuing political and social division. Perhaps through all of that, memorialisation can play a therapeutic role.</p> <p>Memorials naturally remove some of the complexity of the past, replacing it with something smoother, better suited to a broad audience: the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/from-the-archive-blog/2020/nov/10/the-funeral-of-the-unknown-warrior-november-920\">tomb of the Unknown Warrior</a> doesn’t address one specific loss, so it can talk of all loss. Because of this universal ambition it is vital public memorials hit the right tone – being both honest and broadly interpretable, tending to avoid friction. As a result, though, memorials can feel as if they don’t talk to you directly or seem too vague. But at a time when narratives are brutally contested, it seems unlikely that a pandemic memorial will avoid controversy, no matter how skilful the architect.</p> <p><strong>Read more here: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/01/what-should-britains-memorial-covid-pandemic-look-like\">Eddie Blake – What should Britain’s memorial to the Covid pandemic look like?</a></strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/01/what-should-britains-memorial-covid-pandemic-look-like\">What should Britain’s memorial to the Covid pandemic look like? | Eddie Blake</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60b5d8288f088d8c3178f3a9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-01T06:49:42.786Z\">7.49am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Prof Adam Finn, from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, is a second expert in the UK on the airwaves today warning against further easing of domestic restrictions on 21 June.

decrease in local Covid-19 vaccine production has slowed the pace of Brazil’s inoculation drive and contributed to a growing number of people not taking their second doses, according to the latest data from the Fiocruz biomedical institute. Reuters reports: Brazil administered 21 million COVID-19 shots in May, down 14.2% from the 24.5 million vaccines injected in April, according to data compiled by the federally funded Fiocruz and state Health Departments. More than 10.5 million second doses were given in April, compared with 6.6 million last month, the data show. Experts said a lack of shots, coupled with misinformation about vaccines, had led millions of Brazilians to only take one dose so far. A lack of chemical ingredients, mainly delivered from China, has caused Brazil’s two main vaccine production hubs, Fiocruz and the Butantan institute in Sao Paulo, to temporarily pause production of their respective shots. Fiocruz is making the AstraZeneca PLC vaccine, while Butantan is manufacturing a shot developed by China’s Sinovac Biotech Ltd. Carlos Lula, president of the National Council of Health Secretaries (Conass), said about 5 million people had so far not shown up to take their second dose. “Conass is talking to the Health Ministry and seeing what we can do to speed up vaccinations,” he told Reuters. The Coachella music festival will return to the US in April 2022, organisers have announced. The 2020 event was scheduled for April of that year before being pushed to October. It was then moved to April 2021 before again being cancelled due to the health crisis. However promoter Goldenvoice has now confirmed Coachella will return over two weekends next year in California - April 15-17 and April 22-24. Advance ticket sales begin on Friday, organisers added. The Stagecoach music festival, a country music event scheduled for April on the same site as Coachella, is also making its return. It is scheduled to take place over April 29-May 1. New infection control guidance to help keep NHS workers safe from Covid-19 “falls short”, leading nurses in the UK said. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) said that the updated official Covid-19 infection prevention and control guidance “focuses too much on aerosol generating procedures as the main risk”. But doctors have welcomed the new guidance as a “step in the right direction”, PA reports. Concerns were raised early on in the pandemic that medics were not able to get access to appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) amid a worldwide shortage. The guidance, issued jointly by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) as well as public health agencies across the UK’s four nations and NHS England, has been updated to “strengthen existing messaging”, it states. But “no changes to the recommendations, including PPE, have been made in response to the new variant strains at this stage”, the guidance adds, though this is under constant review. The World Health Organization (WHO) has voiced concerns at the Covid-19 situation in South America, warning that outbreaks in the already hard-hit region were once again worsening. The WHO’s emergencies chief Michael Ryan said eight of the 10 countries reporting the coronavirus highest mortality rates in the last week were in the Americas, AFP reports. “The situation in South America right now remains of very high concern,” he told reporters. “South America was really in a difficult situation only a couple of months ago, and that situation again is starting to turn in the wrong direction.” “The disease transmission is intense, community transmission is widespread and healthcare systems remain under pressure,” he said stressing that those factors were being “reflected in mortality rates.” A Brazilian Supreme Court judge has given president Jair Bolsonaro five days to submit information regarding the government’s decision to host the Copa America football tournament despite the nation’s ongoing struggles with Covid-19. Reuters reports: The demand by Ricardo Lewandowski came in response to a suit filed by the opposition Workers’ Party, which objected to hosting the tournament given the current public health situation in Brazil and plunged the fate of Latin America’s biggest sporting event into uncertainty once more. Bolsonaro said earlier on Tuesday his government was on board with hosting the Copa America which starts on June 13, after planned host Argentina pulled out due to a dramatic worsening of the coronavirus pandemic there. It comes as Brazil struggles to cope with the ravages of a virus that has killed 462,791 people, according to government figures, the second-highest tally in the world. “Considering the importance of the matter and the public health emergency resulting from the coronavirus pandemic, as well as the urgency that the case requires, information from the president of the Republic is being requested within the legal deadline,” wrote Lewandowski in an order seen by Reuters. Speaking to supporters in Brasilia, Bolsonaro said he consulted with Health Minister Marcelo Queiroga and they had agreed the four-week long tournament played by 10 South American nations could take place. “As far as it is up to me, and all the ministers, including the health minister, it is all decided,” Bolsonaro said. India said it is aiming to triple capacity to 10 million jabs per day by July to avert another wave of Covid-19 infections as deadly as the outbreak suffered since April. Brazil’s President Jair Bolsinaro has come under fire for agreeing to host the Copa America football tournament in two weeks, despite his country potentially facing a third wave of infections. Heathrow airport in London has begun processing arrivals from red list countries in a dedicated terminal following concerns about them mixing with other passengers. Travellers arriving from red list nations on direct flights are being taken to Terminal 3. Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa called on faster delivery of vaccines to poorer countries, including by waiving patents on vaccine development. Peru has revised its official Covid-19 death toll to 180,764, nearly triple the previous official figure of 69,342, following a government review that shows the severity of the outbreak in the country. The World Health Organisation has recommended a new set of names for the coronavirus “variants of concern”, which will be known by letters of the Greek alphabet. Alpha is the new name for UK/Kent (B.1.1.7), Beta for South Africa (B.1.351), Gamma for Brazil (P.1) and Delta for the variant first detected in India (B.1.617.2). Malaysia has begun a tough nationwide lockdown to battle a worsening coronavirus outbreak. Of almost 2,800 deaths from Covid-19 recorded in the country of 32 million since the start of the pandemic, over 40 percent were in May alone. Israel announced it will begin phasing out coronavirus-related payments to the unemployed and Ireland announced similar steps later this year while maintaining other income and business supports as the economy fully reopens. South Africa and India’s push for a patent waiver on coronavirus vaccines was backed by other major emerging economies on Tuesday, who together called for quicker delivery of vaccines. Brazil, Russia and China echoed the call for a temporary waiver of intellectual property rights by the World Trade Organization, which they said would help poorer countries secure vaccine doses. The five countries also said there needed to be more transparency on pricing, transfer of technology, more local production and sharing of vaccines. The heads of the World Bank, International Monetary Fund, WTO and World Health Organization published a joint op-ed in a dozen newspapers across the world on Tuesday calling for greater vaccine equality. They said the World Bank’s $12 billion in financing to help buy and transport vaccines should soon support 50 countries but also warned that ensuring equal vaccine access needed solid commitments from richer nations. “It calls for upfront financing, upfront vaccine donations, and upfront precautionary investments and planning – rather than commitments that may be slow to materialize,” they said. After making $3 billion (£2.1 billion) selling Covid-19 tests last year, American company Abbott Laboratories has forecast its revenues to fall sharply, largely due to increased vaccination. Reuters reports the company’s shares dropped 6% after its announcement on Tuesday, in major contrast to the more than 20% rise over the course of 2020. The company said reduced demand for its tests has also been down to fewer cases in richer countries and US guidance that fully vaccinated people do not need to be tested to travel. It had previously forecast revenues of up to $7 million but revised the figure to $4 billion to $4.5 billion. France reported 127 new coronavirus deaths in hospitals on Tuesday, compared to 126 on Monday, and the number of Covid-19 patients remained on the decline, Reuters reports. The number of people in hospital with the virus fell by 508 to 16,088 and the number of people in intensive care units with Covid-19 fell by 120 to 2,825 people. Both numbers have been falling steadily for weeks. Italy reported 93 coronavirus-related deaths on Tuesday against 82 the day before, the health ministry said, while the daily tally of new infections rose to 2,483 from 1,820, Reuters reports. Italy has registered 126,221 deaths linked to COVID-19 since its outbreak emerged in February last year, the second-highest toll in Europe after Britain and the eight-highest in the world. The country has reported 4.22 million cases to date. The International Monetary Fund will provide grant financing for £25 billion of a proposed £35 billion project aimed at ramping up global vaccinations against the coronavirus, Reuters reports. IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva said at a joint news conference with the World Health Organization, the World Bank and the World Trade Organization: “We are creating a breeding ground for variants unless we act decisively to end the pandemic everywhere.” Meanwhile the World Bank announced that it has £8.5 billion in Covid-19 vaccine financing available and will have approved vaccination financing operations in over 50 countries by the end of June. The development lender’s president, David Malpass, said it was “vital that we speed up the supply chain for vaccine distribution,” including shortening the manufacturing time, approvals and allocations of doses that have already been produced. The Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, has sparked outrage after approving plans to hold South America’s answer to the European championship in his Covid-stricken country despite warnings Brazil is steaming into a potentially calamitous third wave of infections, Tom Philips reports. Full story here: Rachel Hall here taking over from Kaamil Ahmed. Do send over anything we’ve missed to rachel.hall@theguardian.com After vaccinating large sections of the population and exiting lockdowns, several countries are evaluating the health of their economies and support packages they have had in place. In Israel, where the economy has fully opened, the finance ministry announced Tuesday that it would be scaling down support for the unemployed, starting with under-28s without families, after complaints about businesses struggling to find workers. Ireland, where 385,000 people were receiving unemployment support in April, according to AFP, has announced a €4bn package to rectify the “enormous damage” caused by the pandemic. “Our core objective is to restore, and then go beyond pre-pandemic employment levels,” said Prime minister Micheal Martin. Italy’s economy grew faster in the first quarter of this year than previously estimated, according to new data. Both Gross Domestic Product and unemployment grew 0.1 percent compared to the previous quarter. “Italy is strong, alive and is yearning to restart. The pandemic months have been very tough, for workers and businesses,” Prime Minister Mario Draghi said during a visit in the northern Emilia Romagna region. “But thanks to sacrifices made by Italians and the strong acceleration of the vaccination campaign, we are facing a new phase.” The World Health Organization has approved the Chinese Sinovac vaccine for emergency use, it said in a statement. The second Chinese vaccine against Covid-19 to be approved as safe by the WHO, it said the vaccine would be allowed to delivered under Covax, the global vaccine-sharing programme. India wants to more than triple its supply of coronavirus vaccines to 10 million per day by July as it scales up a campaign seen as keen to avoiding another outbreak as disastrous as April’s, Reuters reports. “We don’t doubt that we will be able to increase the pace of vaccinations, once supply is ramped up,” government advisor V K Paul told reporters on Tuesday. Vaccine manufacturers such as Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech are scrambling to boost supplies, with the country is also in talks with major foreign vaccine producers such as Pfizer Inc, officials have said. The health ministry said nearly 45 million people had been fully vaccinated - 4.7% of the country’s 950 million adult population. India administered nearly 2.8 million doses on Monday, according to data from its official vaccine portal. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has drawn criticism for a slow vaccine rollout even though India is one of the world’s biggest manufacturers of doses, including AstraZeneca’s shot. Healthcare workers in Huthi-held territory in Yemen will be given vaccinations from next week, a World Health Organization official told Reuters. Adham Abdel-Moneim, the WHO’s representative in Yemen, said 10,000 doses arrived in the capital Sanaa yesterday and were put in cold storage. The WHO will run the campaign. Human Rights Watch on Tuesday accused the Huthi rebels of concealing the number of Covid-19 cases in areas it controls and blocking the delivery of vaccines, despite the country receiving 360,000 doses on 31 March. Vaccinations began almost two months ago in parts of Yemen controlled by the Saudi-backed government. Doctors marched throughout India to protest a popular guru who claimed yoga can defeat Covid-19, AFP reports. The doctors denounced and called for the arrest for Baba Ramdev, who claimed modern drugs were “stupid and failed science”. The doctors’ association at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), one of Delhi’s biggest government hospitals, called Ramdev’s comments “disgraceful”. Ramdev, a keen supporter of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, retracted his comments after an appeal by India’s health minister and the guru said he had been merely reading out other people’s WhatsApp messages. But he then caused further outcry by saying that he did not need a coronavirus vaccine because he was protected by yoga and traditional medicine, or Ayurveda. Moderna has followed Pfizer by filing for full approval of its coronavirus vaccine in the US, which is currently authorised for emergency use, Reuters reports. The company said it will be submitting data to the US Food and Drug Administration over coming weeks as it seeks priority approval for the vaccine. Scarce supplies of coronavirus vaccines are endangering refugees in Asia as their host countries experience surges in Covid-19 cases, the UN’s refugee agency, UNHCR, has warned. It urged manufacturers and countries with surplus vaccines to give more vaccines to Covax. Low supplies to the global vaccine-sharing initiative has meant delayed deliveries to countries relying on it. “These countries host the vast majority of more than 80 million forcibly displaced people in the world. Yet so far, they have benefited from only a fraction of the world’s Covid-19 vaccines,” UNHCR said on Tuesday. Not a single vaccine has been delivered in the Rohingya refugees camps in Bangladesh, where the total number of cases identified more than doubled in May alone. There were also increased among refugee populations in Nepal, Pakistan, Thailand, Malaysia, Iran and Indonesia, UNHCR said. Reuters are reporting that Poland will offer Covid-19 vaccinations to children aged 12-15 from 7 June. Michal Dworczyk, the minister in charge of the country’s vaccination programme, announced the move this morning. The European Commission on Friday authorized the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine for use in children as young as 12. The Italian government has allocated €50m to help treat the estimated 164,000 people suffering from serious health problems associated with ‘long Covid’. The money will be used for regular check-ups, including of the heart, lungs and kidneys, of patients until the end of 2023 as part of a strategy also aimed at allowing medics to research the long-term impact of the virus. More than a third of Italians suffering from serious symptoms of long-Covid are from Lombardy, the region hardest-hit by the pandemic. Antonio Pisani, a neurologist at the Mondino research centre, told Il Sole 24 Ore that the risk of neurological disorders is high. Among the most common symptoms he sees among patients are ongoing fatigue, dizziness and difficulty concentrating. He said there were also signs that the virus could predispose people to diseases including Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s. “I had two patients who, before March 2020, had never visited a neurologis … a month ago one was diagnosed with Parkinson’s and the other Alzheimer’s. Therefore it’s as if Covid was an accelerator for a disease that was already there but had not yet presented itself.” Delivery to the Philippines of the first batches of a promised 17m doses of AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine made in Thailand has been delayed by several weeks, a Philippine presidential adviser has said. The delay raises questions about AstraZeneca’s vaccine distribution plan in Southeast Asia, which depend on 200m doses made by Siam Bioscience, a company owned by Thailand’s king that is making vaccines for the first time. Joey Concepcion, a presidential adviser who has been coordinating vaccine procurement with the Philippine government and private sector, told Reuters that AstraZeneca had informed him delivery of the first batch of 1.3m doses would have to be pushed back from the third week of June to mid-July and also reduced to 1.17m doses. Concepcion said he was in touch daily with AstraZeneca and was told there were delays in Thai production. “It is a new plant they are running … that is how it is when you start a new plant,” he said. AstraZeneca has faced legal action in Europe over a failure to deliver supplies as promised. Yemen’s Huthi rebels, who control most of the country’s north including the capital Sanaa, have been blocking international efforts to supply Covid vaccines, Human Rights Watch said. The New York-based group accused Huthi leaders of suppressing information about both the dangers of Covid and the prevalence of the disease in territory under their control. “The deliberate decision of the Huthi authorities to keep the real number of cases of Covid-19 under wraps and their opposition to vaccines are putting Yemeni lives at risk,” said HRW’s deputy Middle East director Michael Page. “Pretending Covid-19 does not exist is not a mitigation strategy and will only lead to mass suffering. “Given the weakened healthcare system in Yemen, Huthi authorities should at least ensure transparency so that civilians living in their areas can understand the scale of the pandemic and facilitate an international vaccination plan that meets the needs on the ground.” AFP report that Yemen received 360,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine on 31 March, the first of 1.9 million doses to be delivered this year through the Covax programme for poorer countries. However, the rebels’ failure to cooperate with the World Health Organization and the Yemeni government has prevented any vaccines from reaching the north, HRW said citing a medical source with “direct knowledge of the circumstances”. As a result, vaccinations have only been occurring in the government-held south. HRW quoted Huthi officials as dismissing Covid-19 as a “conspiracy”. “America bears the primary responsibility for the Covid-19 epidemic,” it quoted rebel leader Abdul Malik al-Huthi, as saying in a televised speech last year. Heathrow airport in London has begun processing arrivals from red list countries in a dedicated terminal following concerns about them mixing with other passengers. Travellers arriving from red list nations on direct flights are being taken to Terminal 3. Russia has announced the resumption of air travel with Britain and a number of other countries – Austria, Hungary, Lebanon, Luxembourg, Croatia, Mauritius, and Morocco – which had been suspended due to coronavirus restrictions. Peru has revised its official Covid-19 death toll to 180,764, nearly triple the previous official figure of 69,342, following a government review that shows the severity of the outbreak in the country. The World Health Organisation has recommended a new set of names for the coronavirus “variants of concern”, which will be known by letters of the Greek alphabet. Alpha is the new name for UK/Kent (B.1.1.7), Beta for South Africa (B.1.351), Gamma for Brazil (P.1) and Delta for the variant first detected in India (B.1.617.2). Chinese authorities in Guangdong province have cancelled flights and locked down communities in response to what is believed to be the first community outbreak of the “Delta” or Indian variant in China. Malaysia has begun a tough nationwide lockdown to battle a worsening coronavirus outbreak. Of almost 2,800 deaths from Covid-19 recorded in the country of 32 million since the start of the pandemic, over 40 percent were in May alone. Taiwan has reported 13 new deaths from Covid-19, and 262 new cases. In a sign that authorities are also clearing the backlog of test results which had seen hundreds added to previous daily totals and caused difficulties in analysing any trends, there were just 65 new positive cases announced today. Germany’s Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious disease is to reduce the coronavirus risk level for the country to “high” from “very high”, health minister Jens Spahn said. A leading scientific adviser to the UK government has repeated calls to delay the 21 June lifting of restrictions by “a few weeks”, warning the coronavirus’s ability to adapt in the face of vaccines has still left the UK in a vulnerable position. Ireland will begin to gradually phase out temporary coronavirus-related jobless payments later this year while maintaining other income and business supports as the economy fully reopens, public expenditure minister Michael McGrath. Australians who have been vaccinated against Covid would be able to leave the country and return with less strict quarantine requirements under a plan that could be trialled within six weeks. Our community team are interested to hear about your experiences of travelling through Heathrow, now that London’s airport has opened up a terminal specifically to deal with arrivals from the so-called “red list” countries. If you’ve travelled and want to get in touch with them, you can find all the details here… Australians who have been vaccinated against Covid would be able to leave the country and return with less strict quarantine requirements under a plan that could be trialled within six weeks. The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, revealed the proposal in the Coalition party room on Tuesday following a question from Liberal MP Jason Falinski, who had asked whether vaccination could see people exempted from outbound and inbound travel restrictions. Australia shut its borders in March 2020 in response to the coronavirus pandemic imposing two weeks hotel quarantine on those arriving into the country. Outbound travel is also banned – which was upheld by the full federal court on Tuesday – although more than 140,000 Australian citizens and residents have travelled overseas for critical business, on compassionate grounds or for other exempted reasons. With Australia struggling to vaccinate its population by the end of 2021, there is pressure on the federal government to provide incentives to get the jab and to ease the travel ban that has separated families. About 40,000 Australians remain stranded overseas due to flight caps imposed as a result of limited hotel quarantine beds. Read more of Paul Karp’s report here: Trial allowing vaccinated Australians to travel overseas could start in six weeks This might be a useful ready-reckoner for some new language that you – and I – are going to need to get used to in the next few weeks, after the WHO recommended a new set of names for the coronavirus “variants of concern”. These are the four you need to know: Alpha - UK/Kent (B.1.1.7) Beta - South Africa (B.1.351) Gamma - Brazil (P.1) Delta - India (B.1.617.2) For ease of use to start with, I’ll try to make sure I am using all three ways of naming each variant until we all get more acquainted with the new terminology. There’s fuller details here: Covid-19 variants to be given Greek alphabet names to avoid stigma The proposed Copa América this summer is in some disarray, with reports that Brazil will replace hosts Argentina, just 13 days before it is due to start. “The Copa América 2021 will be played in Brazil,” an official Conmebol statement said. “Tournament start and end dates are confirmed. The venues and the fixtures will be announced by Conmebol in the next few hours.” The tournament, featuring 10 South American nations, had been due to be held in Argentina and Colombia with joint hosts for the first time in its 105-year history. Colombia was removed as a co-host on 20 May after a wave of protests demanding social and economic change spread across the country, and Argentina has followed. Now Reuters report that Chilean national soccer star Arturo Vidal has been diagnosed with Covid-19 and is in hospital in what appears to be a an isolated case as the squad readies itself for World Cup qualifying match against Argentina on 3 June. “He was diagnosed positive for Covid in the daily preventive exam performed today,” the team said in a statement late yesterday. The team plan to travel to Argentina for the game today. A quick Reuters snap here that Germany’s Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious disease is to reduce the coronavirus risk level for the country to “high” from “very high” as the situation improves, health minister Jens Spahn said on Tuesday. “We have grounds for optimism,” said Spahn at a news conference with the head of the RKI, Lothar Wieler, who said developments were improving but the pandemic was not yet over. Ireland will begin to gradually phase out temporary coronavirus-related jobless payments later this year while maintaining other income and business supports as the economy fully reopens, public expenditure minister Michael McGrath said today. Ireland is emerging from its third and longest lockdown having had one the strictest regimes in Europe for the last 15 months, leaving more than 300,000 people who lost their jobs claiming the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP). Local media reported that the PUP, which is paid out at a higher rate than regular jobless benefits, would be reduced from September and withdrawn by February 2022. “There won’t be a cliff edge in July, we will be looking at an extension of the PUP but also laying out a pathway towards the normalisation of our social welfare code and ultimately unwinding a payment that is pandemic related,” McGrath told national broadcaster RTE. “The changes will be gradual.” The number of people temporarily or permanently unemployed in Ireland stood at 22.4% at the end April, with around three in four on the PUP. McGrath said he expected that cohort to fall very significantly over coming weeks as the economy reopens. He added that additional supports for businesses reopening would be announced later today. Padraic Halpin reminds us for Reuters that the government allowed all shops to open for the first time this year two weeks ago with the hospitality sector to follow with limited capacity in coming days. Nicola Slawson has launched our UK live blog for the day, with the leads line being the warning that the country is in a “perilous moment”. Join her for the latest UK Covid news as it comes in today. I’ll be continuing here with the latest coronavirus news from around the world. Taiwan has reported 13 new deaths from Covid-19, and 262 new cases. In a sign that authorities are also clearing the backlog of test results which had seen hundreds added to previous daily totals and caused difficulties in analysing any trends, there were just 65 new positive cases announced today. The majority of the new cases remained in the north, with 166 in New Taipei city, 87 in Taipei city, and 23 in Taoyuan. Health and welfare minister Chen Shih-Chung said reinfection rates had declined thanks to the measures introduced over the past two weeks - and the community’s cooperation with them - but said it was still not time to relax. Chen the backlog of cases was expected to be cleared in the next day or two. The daily number of vaccinations has increased, but Taiwan still remains far behind other countries, with less than 2% of its population having received a shot. Taiwan’s problems with a Covid-19 vaccination drive are complicated, and involved accusations of geopolitical interference as well as of government bungling, but the important news from recent days is that the government is now allowing private companies, religious groups and local governments to arrange imports. Tech giant Foxconn and its billionaire founder Terry Gou have sought permission to buy 5 million vaccines from Germany’s BioNTech, to distribute among the general population. Gou said on Saturday they hope to airlift the shots from Germany to Taiwan without going via any middlemen. This has received a lukewarm reaction from the government. Chen expressed his gratitude to Gou and said the government was reviewing the application, adding that while it welcomes help in obtaining vaccines from companies and religious groups, Taiwan’s government has stipulated that only it can distribute the shots. Russia has announced the resumption of air travel with Britain and a number of other countries which had been suspended due to coronavirus restrictions. “Given the improvement of the epidemiological situation in the United Kingdom, a decision has been taken to resume regular air travel between Moscow and London from 2 June,” Russian health authorities said in a statement on Monday. Russia will also resume air travel with Austria, Hungary, Lebanon, Luxembourg, Croatia, Mauritius, and Morocco from 10 June, it said. Flights to Turkey, a major tourist destination for Russians, will remain suspended until at least 21 June. AFP note that since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, Russia’s borders have remained largely closed to foreigners. Heathrow has begun processing arrivals from red list countries in a dedicated terminal following concerns about them mixing with other passengers. Travellers arriving from red list nations on direct flights are being taken to Terminal 3. Passengers travelling to the UK on connecting flights from red list locations continue to transit through the airport alongside those from green and amber countries. The red list currently consists of 43 nations from which arrivals are deemed to present a high risk of importing coronavirus. Red list countries from where direct flights to the UK are permitted include India, the Philippines, Pakistan, Kenya and Bangladesh. Passengers arriving in the UK after being in one of those destinations during the previous 10 days must spend 11 nights in a quarantine hotel, costing 1,750 for solo travellers. The decision to separate arrivals on direct flights from red list destinations was welcomed by the GMB union, which had previously warned that “bottlenecks” are putting passengers and staff at risk. Heathrow insisted there were “several layers of protection to keep passengers and colleagues safe”, such as mandatory testing for all arrivals, segregation and ventilation. PA Media notes that an airport executive said in April that passengers are being forced to queue for up to six hours to be processed through immigration halls. It is the first time Terminal 3 has been used since April 2020, when it was closed to save costs amid the collapse in demand for travel. Heathrow plans to move its new facility for processing red list arrivals to Terminal 4 “as soon as operationally possible”. The pressure to get England’s Covid restrictions dropped on 21 June is coming from several quarters, not least those sectors of the hospitality industry that are still unable to open their doors. CEO of the Night Time Industries Association, Michael Kill, has been pushing for earlier clarification of when reopening might happen. He told Sky News: Nine out of 10 late-night businesses feel that veering off the roadmap would threaten their survival. Ninety-five per cent of businesses have already made financial commitments in terms of stock, staff and entertainment. So this is a key time, and the government really needs to step up and make it very clear exactly what their intentions are. The UK’s small businesses minister Paul Scully has been on LBC this morning reiterating the message from the government that people in the UK should use “caution” in the face of the growing number of cases of the “Delta” variant of coronavirus – the B.1.617.2 variant first detected in India. He stressed again that no decision would be taken until 14 June, saying: I know for some people that won’t be quick enough, but we’ve got to make sure that we are working with the latest data, accurate data. Scientists have to be able to go through this with a fine tooth comb, because it’s a really really important decision that affects so many people. Pressed about whether the country was in fact seeing increased hospitalisations and what the threat to the NHS currently was, he said: We’ve just got to make sure that we are looking forward to see what happens in the next few weeks and months in terms of that modelling, based on the data. Because what we do know is that when case rates go up, hospitalisations to date have also gone up. But the vaccination progress is still continuing with 63 million vaccinations and that is what is going to help us win this race. Eddie Blake writes for us this morning, asking what should Britain’s memorial to the Covid pandemic look like? Memorials aim to be an eloquent last word on an event. A key quality is that they resist change: they attempt to fix for us an abiding sense of what exactly has happened. They can be many things: columns, tombs, plaques, cenotaphs, village halls, even housing. But who are they for? The people who suffered, their families, the wider public or future generations? At some point, inevitably, there will be an official, national memorial of the pandemic in the UK (as well as many more, surely, at local and international levels). What, then, should it look like? It will have to contend with how messy the past year has been – the death, the sorrow, the fear, but also the ensuing political and social division. Perhaps through all of that, memorialisation can play a therapeutic role. Memorials naturally remove some of the complexity of the past, replacing it with something smoother, better suited to a broad audience: the tomb of the Unknown Warrior doesn’t address one specific loss, so it can talk of all loss. Because of this universal ambition it is vital public memorials hit the right tone – being both honest and broadly interpretable, tending to avoid friction. As a result, though, memorials can feel as if they don’t talk to you directly or seem too vague. But at a time when narratives are brutally contested, it seems unlikely that a pandemic memorial will avoid controversy, no matter how skilful the architect. Read more here: Eddie Blake – What should Britain’s memorial to the Covid pandemic look like? Prof Adam Finn, from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, is a second expert in the UK on the airwaves today warning against further easing of domestic restrictions on 21 June. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “There’s vulnerability across the country. The idea that somehow the job is done, is wrong. “We’ve still got a lot of people out there who’ve neither had this virus … nor yet been immunised, and that’s why we’re in a vulnerable position right now.” PA Media reports Finn added: “There are a lot of people who are very fed up about the idea of us even worrying about this. Since I’ve been saying in the last 24 hours that we should be cautious I’ve been getting lots of messages from people telling me to shut up basically. “But the truth is that a more infectious virus, which is what it looks like we’ve got, will reach people who are vulnerable – those who did not make a good response to the vaccine, those who have not yet had their doses – and that will be a problem for everyone because in the end it will be worse economically as well as for public health if we end up having to shut down again.” Chinese authorities in Guangdong province have cancelled flights and locked down communities in response to what is believed to be the first community outbreak of the “Delta” or Indian variant in China. Guangdong province had been reporting daily single figures of local cases, including asymptomatic cases, for more than a week, until the case load suddenly jumped to 23 on Monday, including three asymptomatic cases, and 11 on Tuesday. Most of Guandong’s cases are in the city of Guangzhou, with some in nearby Foshan, which has a population of 7.2 million. Authorities said all cases were found to be the strain commonly known as the Indian variant of the virus, now renamed by the WHO as the “Delta” variant. “In this race against the virus, we must run a bit ahead and run faster than before in order to block the spread of the virus and cut off the infection chain in time,” said Huang Guanglie, director of the Guangzhou municipal health commission. Guangzhou deputy mayor, Li Ming, said the strain had a short incubation period, a high viral load, and spread quickly. However she said that the trajectory was “under control”. In response hundreds of flights at the busy Guangdong Baiyun international airport have been cancelled, and authorities ordered some streets in the Liwan neighbourhood of Guangzhou city to isolate at home, with only one person per household allowed out to buy daily necessities. On Sunday, all 15.3 million Guangzhou residents were barred from leaving via bus, air or train without a green code on the health management app and a negative Covid test taken in the preceding 72 hours. Read more of Helen Davidson’s report here: China locks down part of Guangzhou amid outbreak of Indian Covid variant Malaysia has begun a tough nationwide lockdown to battle a worsening coronavirus outbreak, AFP reports, as countries across Southeast Asia struggle with a resurgence in cases driven by infectious variants. It writes, Much of the region escaped the pandemic’s first wave last year relatively unscathed by rapidly closing borders and introducing curbs. But countries from Thailand to Vietnam are being hammered by fresh surges, with efforts to quell outbreaks hampered by slow vaccine rollouts and populations weary of restrictions. Malaysia is among the worst hit. Of almost 2,800 deaths from Covid-19 recorded in the country of 32 million since the start of the pandemic, over 40 percent were in May alone. More than 570,000 infections have been reported, with a string of new daily records last week. As well as variants, the outbreak has been fanned by gatherings in the Muslim-majority country during the holy month of Ramadan and the Eid al-Fitr holiday, often in defiance of coronavirus rules. Under what authorities have termed a “total lockdown” in force from Tuesday, only essential businesses - such as supermarkets and medical clinics - can operate, people can only go outside for necessities, and most schools are closed. Travel between most parts of the country had already been banned for months. Just following up on Prof Ravi Gupta’s words there with a quick check on the UK government’s own coronavirus dashboard, and we can see that with data in from 31 May now, that the rolling seven-day averages of cases, deaths and hospitalisations are all up – all admittedly from a baseline much lower than was in the earlier peak of the second wave of the virus. You can have look for yourself here. A leading scientific adviser to the UK government has repeated calls to delay the 21 June lifting of restrictions by “a few weeks”, warning the coronavirus’s ability to adapt in the face of vaccines has still left the UK in a vulnerable position. Prof Ravi Gupta, a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), said the increased socialisation which has followed last month’s phase of restriction lifting could be expected to lead to “quite a lot” of hospital admissions. PA Media reports that he told ITV’s Good Morning Britain that while the nation had performed “amazingly well” in its vaccination programme, it was still too early “to put the vaccine straight up against the virus”. Gupta said a delay of a few weeks to the 21 June target could have a significant impact on Britain’s battle against the pandemic, and recommended it should be made clear to the public that it would be a temporary measure based on recent events, chiefly the emergence of the newly-designated “Delta variant”, which we had previously been calling the B.1.617.2 strain of the virus or the variant that was first detected in India. “Even a month delay could have a big impact on the eventual outcome of this,” said Prof Gupta. He continued: “As long as it’s clear to people this is not an unlimited extension of the lockdown but actually just a reassessment, that would be realistic. “Because we didn’t plan for the 617.2 variant when the initial roadmap was made, and actually things have gone really well except for the fact that we have this new variant to complicate things. “We must remember this is a virus that does adapt, and faced with vaccines it will eventually start to make mutations to avoid them even further, and then we could be in an even more precarious situation after that.” Vietnam is seeking to buy Covid-19 vaccine production technology and wants to build a plant to supply the Covax programme, Reuters reports, as the country tries to step up vaccinations to stem a new outbreak of infections. India and South Africa are among developing countries that have been pushing for an intellectual property waiver for Covid-19 vaccines. But even with a surprise US shift last month to support a waiver World Trade Organization talks on the issue on Monday failed to achieve a breakthrough. “Vietnam would build the plant and would like to receive the patent so it could supply vaccines to Covax, to other countries as well as to Vietnam,” the health ministry said in a statement, following a meeting with Covax representatives overnight. India has reported its lowest daily rise in new coronavirus infections since 8 April at 127,510 cases over the past 24 hours, while deaths rose by 2,795, Reuters reports. The South Asian nation’s tally of infections now stands at 28.2 million, while the death toll has reached 331,895, health ministry data showed. That’s it from me, Helen Livingstone, for today. I’m handing over to my colleague Martin Belam in London. Here’s a quick roundup of what’s been happening so far: Peru has revised its official Covid-19 death toll to 180,764, nearly triple the previous official figure of 69,342, following a government review that shows the severity of the outbreak in the country. As new coronavirus variants continue to be discovered, the World Health Organization has revealed new names, after the letters of the Greek alphabet, to simplify the discussion around the variants and avoid stigma. Australia’s drug regulator says it may refer anti-vaccination Facebook posts to federal police after anti-vaccine campaigners targeted an MP who posted about getting the jab. Australia’s federal court has rejected a bid by a rightwing thinktank to overturn the country’s ban on outbound travel. US gun sales spiked during the pandemic and continue to rise, with first-time buyers making up more than a fifth of those who purchased guns Germany has pledged to crack down on fraud in coronavirus test centres, after evidence that some have been claiming for more tests than they have carried out. Scientists are urging the government to speed up second doses of Covid vaccines and delay a decision on easing lockdown restrictions in England on 21 June in an effort to tackle the creeping spread of new cases. France has opened up vaccines to all adults a week before Germany, as Europe rushed to avoid another wave of infections caused by new virus variants. Vietnam has announced the suspension of incoming international flights to its capital and tightened restrictions in its biggest city. The inbound flight suspension to Hanoi will apply from 1-7 June. Travellers from the UK will have to provide “compelling reasons” to enter France from Monday, as French authorities tighten curbs to halt the spread of the Indian Covid variant. The European Commission has proposed that all EU countries gradually ease travel measures over the summer. School closures in England during the Covid lockdown badly damaged the mental health of mothers but had no impact on fathers’ wellbeing, research has found. Here’s a sobering, but important, feature by Guardian contributor V on the ways in which the pandemic has erased women’s rights and left them vulnerable to violence. She writes, All over the world, patriarchy has taken full advantage of the virus to reclaim power – on the one hand, escalating the danger and violence to women, and on the other, stepping in as their supposed controller and protector. And in more Australia-related Covid news, the country’s drug regulator is considering referring Covid vaccine misinformation posts to the federal police, after anti-vaccine campaigners targeted an MP who posted about getting the jab. In response to a viral post of Labor backbencher Julian Hill receiving his vaccine, numerous users posted false material purportedly from the Therapeutic Goods Administration wrongly claiming Covid-19 vaccines have caused more than 200 deaths. The figure they used was in fact the number of people who have died after receiving the vaccine, but apart from one case, none have been linked by the TGA to the vaccine. The TGA told Guardian Australia the alleged posting of the death counter was “particularly concerning” and it would consider referring it to the federal police. Australia’s federal court has rejected a bid by a rightwing thinktank to overturn the country’s ban on outbound travel. Libertyworks had argued that the health minister, Greg Hunt, has no power to impose a blanket rule stopping citizens from leaving the country. But Justices Anna Katzmann, Michael Wigney and Thomas Thawley dismissed the application and ordered Libertyworks to pay the commonwealth’s costs. The federal government had argued that, if successful, the case would have “driven a truck” through Hunt’s powers under the Biosecurity Act to impose measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19 during the global pandemic.

The president will soon deliver remarks at the center to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the massacre, which killed at least 300 African Americans. In his remarks in Tulsa this afternoon, Joe Biden is expected to formally unveil a new set of initiatives aimed at narrowing the racial wealth gap in America. But the policies, which the White House announced this morning, are already attracting some criticism from the NAACP. The Washington Post reports: Biden’s proposals drew immediate criticism from the nation’s most prominent civil rights group, the NAACP, whose leader said the president’s plan omitted canceling student debt, one of the most effective ways to shrink the wealth gap, according to some researchers. ‘Components of the plan are encouraging, but it fails to address the student loan debt crisis that disproportionately affects African Americans,’ said Derrick Johnson, president of the NAACP. ‘You cannot begin to address the racial wealth gap without addressing the student loan debt crisis.’ Although he applauded Biden’s focus on homeownership as a way to build wealth, Johnson pointed out that many African Americans simply won’t qualify for needed loans because of a high debt-to-income ratio. That’s particularly true, he said, among government workers. ‘That must be addressed if there is going to be a question of dealing with the racial wealth gap,’ Johnson said. He supports cutting as much as $50,000 per person in student debt but said it is not a ‘magic number.’ Joe Biden has arrived in Tulsa, Oklahoma, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the city’s race massacre. The president is accompanied on the trip by housing and urban development secretary Marcia Fudge, domestic policy adviser Susan Rice and senior adviser Cedric Richmond. The president will first tour the Greenwood Cultural Center, which is dedicated to honoring the hundreds of African Americans who died in the massacre. Biden will later deliver remarks on the massacre, and he is expected to formally unveil a series of new initiatives that his administration is launching to narrow the racial wealth gap in the country. The White House has also said Biden will meet with survivors of the massacre, three of whom testified before Congress two weeks ago. Florida Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried has officially filed paperwork to run for governor next year. The filing follows months of speculation that Fried, currently the only Florida Democrat serving in a statewide office, would jump into the race to unseat Republican incumbent Ron DeSantis. “I’m here to break the rigged system in Florida,” Fried said in a video announcing her candidacy. “It’s corrupt, it’s anti-democratic, and it’s time for something new.” Fried will have some competition for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, as congressman Charlie Crist has already announced his campaign. Democratic state Senator Annette Taddeo is also considering launching a bid. Whoever wins the Democratic primary race will have to run against DeSantis, who has positioned himself as a potential successor to Donald Trump in the Republican party. Fried has repeatedly criticized DeSantis over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and has called for an FBI investigation into allegations that the governor gave early vaccine access to some of his donors. In case you missed it this morning: Joe Biden issued a proclamation to mark the beginning of LGBTQ+ Pride Month. “This Pride Month, we recognize the valuable contributions of LGBTQ+ individuals across America, and we reaffirm our commitment to standing in solidarity with LGBTQ+ Americans in their ongoing struggle against discrimination and injustice,” the president said in his proclamation. Biden touted the level of LGBTQ+ representation in his administration, saying, “Nearly 14 percent of my 1,500 agency appointees identify as LGBTQ+, and I am particularly honored by the service of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, the first openly LGBTQ+ person to serve in the Cabinet, and Assistant Health Secretary Dr. Rachel Levine, the first openly transgender person to be confirmed by the Senate.” The president noted the LGBTQ+ community has achieved “remarkable progress” since the Stonewall Inn riots of June 1969, but he also emphasized that much work still needs to be done to ensure equal rights for LGBTQ+ Americans. He specifically mentioned the recent wave of state bills aimed at restricting trans students’ participating in school athletics. “During LGBTQ+ Pride Month, we recognize the resilience and determination of the many individuals who are fighting to live freely and authentically. In doing so, they are opening hearts and minds, and laying the foundation for a more just and equitable America,” Biden said. “This Pride Month, we affirm our obligation to uphold the dignity of all people, and dedicate ourselves to protecting the most vulnerable among us.” Joe Biden will soon become the first sitting US president to visit the site of the white supremacist race massacre in Tulsa 100 years ago. There’s been a press huddle aboard Air Force One en route to Oklahoma, where Biden plans to meet with the last survivors of the massacre and announce new investment in Greenwood, the area of Tulsa that was razed by a white mob in 1921, and communities like it where majority-Black populations endure entrenched disadvantage in business, work and housing as a result of racial discrimination. Reuters reports: “What these survivors have endured is tragic and devastating,” White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on the flight to Oklahoma on Tuesday. He plans to listen, learn and portray his heartfelt gratitude to them for sharing their stories, she said. The president will address the U.S. legacy of racist violence, and the challenges to unity ahead, an administration official said. Biden cannot fulfill his promise to restore the “soul” of the nation without recognizing the complexity of U.S. history, the official said. In a proclamation on Monday, Biden asked all Americans to “reflect on the deep roots of racial terror in our Nation and recommit to the work of rooting out systemic racism across our country.” His visit comes during a racial reckoning in the United States as the country’s white majority shrinks, threats increase from white supremacist groups and the country re-examines its treatment of African Americans after last year’s murder of George Floyd, a Black man, by a white Minneapolis police officer, which sparked nationwide protests. Biden, who won the presidency on the strength of Black voter support, made fighting racial inequality a key platform of his 2020 campaign and has done the same during his short tenure in the White House. The Republican governor of Florida, Ron DsSantis, has fired off another shot in the culture war by signing a bill banning transgender females from girls’ sports in schools. “In Florida, girls are going to play girls sports and boys are going to play boys sports,” DeSantis said, signing the bill into law at a Christian academy in Jacksonville on Tuesday. “We’re going to make sure that that’s the reality.” As the AP reports: The new law inflames an already contentious discussion as Republican-controlled states move to limit the rights of LGBTQ people. It also could impose severe financial consequences on Florida. The NCAA, which oversees college athletics, has threatened to relocate key games from states that discriminate against athletes. When the Florida legislature was considering the measure in April, the NCAA said it would commit championship games to “locations where hosts can commit to providing an environment that is safe, healthy and free of discrimination”. The measure approved by the GOP-led legislature takes effect 1 July. Human Rights Campaign president Alphonso David said: “All Floridians will have to face the consequences of this anti-transgender legislation - including economic harm, expensive taxpayer-funded legal battles and a tarnished reputation.” Democrats and LGBTQ advocates said the law will be challenged in court. “This is yet another hate-driven attack from the governor and Republican legislators, and it’s insulting that they’ve staged this morning’s photo-op on the first day of Pride Month,” said state senator Shevrin Jones. “At the end of the day, transgender kids are just kids.” The Florida law mirrors an Idaho law, the first of its kind when enacted last year, that is now mired in legal challenges. Republican governors in Arkansas, Mississippi and Tennessee recently signed similar measures. Here’s where the day stands so far: Joe Biden is en route to Tulsa, Oklahoma, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the city’s race massacre. The president will deliver remarks to honor the victims of the massacre and meet with survivors of the violence, which killed at least 300 African Americans in 1921. Ahead of the trip, the Biden administration announced a series of initiatives aimed at narrowing the country’s racial wealth gap. The administration pledged to take action to address racial housing discrimination and use its purchasing power to direct an additional $100 billion to small disadvantaged business owners. Biden will meet tomorrow with Republican Senator Shelley Moore Capito to discuss a potential compromise on infrastructure. The meeting comes a week after Republicans outlined their latest offer, which called for spending $928 billion on infrastructure over the next eight years, far less than what Biden has proposed. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. The Fox News host Sean Hannity was criticised for appearing at a Donald Trump rally in 2018 but according to a new book he was involved again with Trump’s campaign in 2020, helping write an ad that aired on his primetime show. Frankly, We Did Win This Election: The Inside Story of How Trump Lost, by Mike Bender, senior White House reporter for the Wall Street Journal, will be published in August. News of its contents, including “some amazingly hilarious revelations” about Mike Pence, Rudy Giuliani, Roger Stone, Tucker Carlson, Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump “and the rest of the Trump posse”, was reported by Punchbowl News. According to the news site, the ad known to Trump insiders as “the Hannity ad” and “the one Hannity wrote” ran only during Hannity’s show. An anonymous Trump aide is reported as saying “Hannity said this is our best spot yet” but Bender reports: “Inside the campaign, the spot was mocked mercilessly – mostly because of the dramatic, over-the-top language and a message that seemed to value quantity over quality. “Donald Trump himself, in a post-election interview with Bender, did not dispute that Hannity wrote the ad, which called [Joe] Biden a ‘47-year swamp creature’ who had ‘accomplished nothing’ and supported a ‘radical, socialist Green New Deal’.” Hannity denied writing the ad, telling Bender: “The world knows that Sean Hannity supports Donald Trump. But my involvement specifically in the campaign – no. I was not involved that much. Anybody who said that is full of shit.” Joe Biden is now en route to Tulsa, Oklahoma, where he will commemorate the 100th anniversary of the city’s race massacre. The president did not stop to take questions from reporters as he boarded Air Force One for the trip to Tulsa, where he will meet with massacre survivors and deliver remarks to honor the victims of the violence. The Washington Post has obtained more than 800 pages of emails to and from Anthony Fauci, the senior US health official who is now chief medical adviser to President Joe Biden, during the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic last year. The paper reports that the emails offer a window into the chaos, panic and confusion of the time, and of the considerable difficulties Fauci faced as a prominent figure in a Covid task force serving Donald Trump. As Fauci recently told the Post, “I was getting every single kind of question, mostly people who were a little bit confused about the mixed messages that were coming out of the White House and wanted to know what’s the real scoop. “I have a reputation that I respond to people when they ask for help, even if it takes a long time. And it’s very time consuming, but I do.” The Post obtained the emails through the Freedom of Information Act. Some exchanges are with George Gao, a top Chinese health official. “Lets work together to get the virus out of the earth,” Gao says in one message. “We will get through this together,” Fauci replies. US-China tensions have been high throughout the pandemic but the US is now investigating whether the virus, discovered in Wuhan province, came from animals, as has been the scientific community’s position for some time, or whether there is truth to the theory that the virus was being studied in a laboratory and escaped. In a column for the Guardian on Tuesday, the author Thomas Frank said that if true, the laboratory leak theory “is the kind of thing that could obliterate the faith of millions” of Americans who have followed government advice throughout the pandemic. In another exchange between Fauci and Gao, the Chinese official refers to “some news (hope it is fake) that [you] are being attacked by some people. Hope you are well under such [an] irrational situation”. “Thank you for your kind note,” Fauci replies. “All is well despite some crazy people in this world.” Fauci was often at odds with Trump and others who sought to play down the severity of the threat to US public health. The scientist ended up having to hire security. Here’s our own interview with Fauci, published yesterday: Joe Biden is “finishing the job” begun by Barack Obama, the former president told the New York Times in an interview released on Tuesday. “I think that what we’re seeing now, is Joe and the administration are essentially finishing the job,” Obama said. “And I think it’ll be an interesting test. “Ninety per cent of the folks who were there in my administration, they are continuing and building on the policies we talked about, whether it’s the Affordable Care Act or our climate change agenda and the Paris [climate deal], and figuring out how do we improve the ladders to mobility through things like community colleges.” Obama also mused about Biden’s much-discussed ability to reach voters, particularly in post-industrial midwestern states, who voted Obama then switched to Donald Trump. “By virtue of biography and generationally,” Obama said, his vice-president, who is 78 and was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, “can still reach some of those folks”. “People knew I was left on issues like race, or gender equality, and LGBTQ issues and so forth,” Obama said. “But I think maybe the reason I was successful campaigning in downstate Illinois, or Iowa, or places like that is they never felt as if I was condemning them for not having gotten to the politically correct answer quick enough, or that somehow they were morally suspect because they had grown up with and believed more traditional values.” In fact Obama famously stirred controversy in 2008 when he said such voters “get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren’t like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations”. The New York Times interviewer did not raise those remarks. Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell once again defended Republicans’ decision to block the bill to create a bipartisan commission to study the January 6 insurrection. “I don’t think anybody’s going to get away with anything,” the Republican leader said in Kentucky today. “I think we’ll know everything we need to know. We were all witnesses, we were right there when it happened. And I simply think the commission is not necessary.” McConnell’s comments come four days after Senate Republicans blocked the commission bill from being taken up for debate, killing the legislation for now. Six Republicans joined their Democratic colleagues in voting to advance the bill, but Democrats needed 10 Republican votes to overcome a filibuster of the legislation. Alexandra Villareal reports for the Guardian: Republicans in Texas are already plotting to resurrect their fight for sweeping voting restrictions after Democratic lawmakers walked out of the state capitol and blocked an 11th-hour attempt to ram through legislation that would have made it harder to cast a ballot. The Texas governor, Greg Abbott – who leads the state’s domineering Republican majority – has announced he will include the high-stakes issue on his agenda when he reconvenes the legislature for a rapid-fire special session. He called the failure of the bill “deeply disappointing”. Abbott, who says “election integrity” remains an emergency in Texas, wields control over what is essentially legislative overtime, where lawmakers consider issues on a sped-up timeline. When the session will begin remains unclear. But advocates are still painting last night’s historic show of force as an inflection point for the Texas legislature and America, when Democrats shirked business as usual for aggressive tactics that matched the urgency of a teetering democracy. “The fight you saw last night is the fight that will remain and continue,” state representative Trey Martinez Fischer, a Democrat representing San Antonio, told the Guardian. “That’s our commitment.” Joe Biden’s visit to Tulsa comes almost exactly one year after Donald Trump traveled to the city to hold his first campaign rally since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, an event that sparked intense criticism and attracted protests. The AP notes: After suspending his campaign rallies because of the coronavirus pandemic, Trump, a Republican, chose Tulsa as the place to mark his return. But his decision to schedule the rally on June 19, the holiday known as Juneteenth that commemorates the end of slavery in the United States, was met with such fierce criticism that he postponed the event by a day. The rally was still marked by protests outside and empty seats inside an arena downtown. Trump arrived in Tulsa during a highly charged moment, days after he had ordered the forcible clearing of Lafayette Square across from the White House, with federal officers pushing out those peacefully protesting [George] Floyd’s death. Trump reflexively embraced law enforcement throughout his presidency and was frequently accused of using racist rhetoric when painting apocalyptic — and inaccurate — scenes of American cities. While in Oklahoma today, Joe Biden will meet with survivors of the Tulsa race massacre and visit the Greenwood Cultural Center. The center describes itself as “the keeper of the flame for the Black Wall Street era, the events known as the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, and the astounding resurgence of the Greenwood District in the months and years following the tragedy”. The Guardian’s Sam Levine reports: Conservative activists across America are pushing efforts to review the 2020 vote more than six months after the election, a move experts say is a dangerous attempt to continue to sow doubt about the results of the 2020 election that strikes at the heart of America’s democratic process. Encouraged by an ongoing haphazard review of 2.1m ballots in Arizona, activists are pushing to review votes or voting equipment in California, Georgia, Michigan, and New Hampshire. Meanwhile, in Wisconsin, the powerful speaker of the state house of representatives recently hired ex-law enforcement officers, including one with a history of supporting Republicans, to spend the next three months investigating claims of fraud. At least one of the officers hired has a history of supporting GOP claims. The announcement also came after state officials announced they found just 27 cases of potential fraud in 2020 out of 3.3m votes cast. The reviews are not going to change the 2020 election results or find widespread fraud, which is exceedingly rare. Nonetheless, the conservative activists behind the effort – many of whom have little election experience – have championed the reviews as an attempt to assuage concerns the 2020 election was stolen. If the probes don’t turn up anything, they will only serve to increase confidence in elections, proponents say. Joe Biden also released a statement yesterday to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Tulsa race massacre, calling on Americans to “recommit” to efforts to address systemic racism in the US. “On this solemn centennial of the Tulsa Race Massacre, I call on the American people to reflect on the deep roots of racial terror in our nation and recommit to the work of rooting out systemic racism across our country,” Biden said in the statement. The president noted that the federal government “must reckon with and acknowledge the role that it has played in stripping wealth and opportunity from Black communities”. The Biden administration announced today a series of initiatives aimed at narrowing the racial wealth gap in the US, including efforts to support affordable housing and minority-owned small businesses. Reflecting on the lives and businesses lost in Tulsa in 1921, Biden said yesterday, “We honor the legacy of the Greenwood community, and of Black Wall Street, by reaffirming our commitment to advance racial justice through the whole of our government, and working to root out systemic racism from our laws, our policies, and our hearts.” The full-page advert in a special Black History edition of USA Today presents a technicolor vision of modern-day Tulsa, with sparkling images of public parks and brightly-painted murals celebrating the local Black community under the banner headline: “Tulsa Triumphs”. “Tulsa is leading America’s journey to racial healing,” the text says, inviting visitors from across the US to sample the delights of Oklahoma’s second-largest city. The enticements include “an emotional opportunity for learning and reflection” and a “space for reconciliation… Tulsa triumphs, and you can be a part of this pilgrimage.” The advert is a brazen attempt to turn Tulsa’s grim distinction as the setting of one of the most grotesque mass lynchings in US history into a tourist draw. It is the work of the Tulsa Race Massacre Centennial Commission, a body of prominent state and city politicians and other local notables who have put together the city’s established version of the 100th anniversary of a very special day. On that day, 31 May 1921, white Tulsans ran amok, shooting any Black person in sight, dropping incendiary devices from the air onto their homes and burning to the ground one of the most flourishing Black business districts in the country, known as “Black Wall Street”. Some 35 blocks of Black real estate in the Greenwood neighbourhood were destroyed. At least 300 men, women and children were murdered. Over 24 hours, Tulsa witnessed what is thought to be the worst single event of white supremacist violence against African Americans in the nation’s history. From the terror of 31 May 1921 to the “triumph” of 31 May 2021 – it makes for a powerful attraction for visitors. The only hitch with this depiction of Tulsa rising from the ashes is that from the perspective of the Black survivors and many of the descendants of the massacre, it has no bearing in reality. Ahead of Joe Biden’s Tulsa trip, his administration also outlined how his American Jobs Plan will directly benefit communities of color. The president’s proposal includes a $10 billion community revitalization fund that will help fund community-led infrastructure projects and a $15 billion grant program to bolster transportation infrastructure. Biden has also called for the creation of a Neighborhood Homes Tax Credit to support the development of affordable housing and a $5 billion grant program to expand housing options for Americans with low or moderate incomes. Finally, the president has indicated he would like to invest $31 billion to expand efforts to support minority-owned small businesses. However, it is very unclear if any of these initiatives will make it into the final version of the infrastructure bill. Senate Republicans have proposed a $257 billion bill, much smaller than the $1.7 trillion infrastructure package that Biden is pushing, and it’s possible that proposals like those above may end up getting cut from the legislation. The White House has just confirmed Biden will meet with Republican Senator Shelley Moore Capito to discuss her team’s latest offer. That meeting will likely offer insight into the size and scope of the final bill. Greetings from Washington, live blog readers. Joe Biden will travel today to Tulsa, Oklahoma, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the city’s race massacre, which targeted affluent African Americans and their businesses. Ahead of the president’s trip, the White House announced this morning a series of new initiatives aimed at narrowing the country’s racial wealth gap. The administration pledged to take action to address racial housing discrimination and use its purchasing power to direct an additional $100 Billion to small disadvantaged business owners. The trip and the administration’s announcement come two weeks after three living survivors of the massacre -- Viola Fletcher, Hughes Van Ellis and Lessie Evelyn Benningfield Randle -- testified to Congress about the need to compensate massacre survivors and their descendants. “I am here seeking justice,” Fletcher said at the House subcommittee hearing. “I am here asking my country to acknowledge what happened in Tulsa in 1921.” The blog will have more details on the trip coming up, so stay tuned.","charCount":"25755","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/joan-greve\">Joan E Greve</a> in Washington"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2021/jun/01/sacklers-opioid-crisis-website","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-01T19:05:32Z","webTitle":"Sacklers deny responsibility for opioid crisis and claim lawyers ‘invented false narrative’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jun/01/sacklers-opioid-crisis-website","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2021/jun/01/sacklers-opioid-crisis-website","fields":{"headline":"Sacklers deny responsibility for opioid crisis and claim lawyers ‘invented false narrative’","standfirst":"<p>A branch of the family launches website and claims they are victims of smear campaign by lawyers seeking to make profit</p>","trailText":"A branch of the family launches website and claims they are victims of smear campaign by lawyers seeking to make profit","byline":"Chris McGreal in New York","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d8631eba2e9eec86a85f63c0b9e1698be416c81e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d8631eba2e9eec86a85f63c0b9e1698be416c81e/0_200_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Purdue Pharma headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Purdue Pharma headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Lennihan/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>A branch of the Sackler family has launched a website denying responsibility for the US opioid epidemic even after agreeing to pay billions of dollars to settle lawsuits over the crisis.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.judgeforyourselves.info/\">website</a>, called Judge for Yourselves, claims that the family and the company it owns, Connecticut-based Purdue Pharma, are victims of a smear campaign by lawyers seeking to profit from a “strategically invented false narrative” that the firm’s high-strength prescription painkiller, OxyContin, drove <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/nov/08/the-making-of-an-opioid-epidemic\">an epidemic</a> that has ultimately claimed more than 500,000 lives over the past two decades.</p> <p>It says the Sackler family regrets that the drug “unexpectedly became part of the opioid crisis” but that those members who ran Purdue “acted lawfully and ethically”.</p> <p>However, the site also downplays Purdue’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/22/purdue-pharma-opioids-epidemic-guilty-plea-analysis\">guilty pleas</a> to federal crimes on two occasions, in 2007 and last year, over its huge marketing push to sell OxyContin to the masses, which included false claims that the drug was less addictive than other narcotic painkillers.</p> <p>It claims that the family is prepared to hand over a part of its fortune, even though it insists there was no wrongdoing, because it “does not want funds available for a public benefit to be consumed by attorneys’ fees”.</p> <p>The publicity campaign by the branch of the family descended from Raymond Sackler, one of two brothers who owned Purdue Pharma when the company entered the opioid painkiller market, comes amid accusations that it is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/11/opioid-crisis-sacklers-proposal-shield-wealth\">misusing</a> bankruptcy proceedings to keep hold of some of the billions of dollars the family made from OxyContin.</p> <p>Last week a judge approved a plan for the two branches of the Sackler family who have made their multibillion-dollar fortune from OxyContin to pay $4.5bn to settle more than 3,000 civil lawsuits.

The website, called Judge for Yourselves, claims that the family and the company it owns, Connecticut-based Purdue Pharma, are victims of a smear campaign by lawyers seeking to profit from a “strategically invented false narrative” that the firm’s high-strength prescription painkiller, OxyContin, drove an epidemic that has ultimately claimed more than 500,000 lives over the past two decades. It says the Sackler family regrets that the drug “unexpectedly became part of the opioid crisis” but that those members who ran Purdue “acted lawfully and ethically”. However, the site also downplays Purdue’s guilty pleas to federal crimes on two occasions, in 2007 and last year, over its huge marketing push to sell OxyContin to the masses, which included false claims that the drug was less addictive than other narcotic painkillers. It claims that the family is prepared to hand over a part of its fortune, even though it insists there was no wrongdoing, because it “does not want funds available for a public benefit to be consumed by attorneys’ fees”. The publicity campaign by the branch of the family descended from Raymond Sackler, one of two brothers who owned Purdue Pharma when the company entered the opioid painkiller market, comes amid accusations that it is misusing bankruptcy proceedings to keep hold of some of the billions of dollars the family made from OxyContin. Last week a judge approved a plan for the two branches of the Sackler family who have made their multibillion-dollar fortune from OxyContin to pay $4.5bn to settle more than 3,000 civil lawsuits. The plan would also turn Purdue Pharma into a non-profit company. But, in a highly unusual move, the deal would shield the Sacklers from further lawsuits, although not criminal prosecutions, and allow them to keep billions of dollars in profits from opioids even though the family itself has not sought bankruptcy. The publicity drive also follows publication of a damning biography of the family, Empire of Pain by the New Yorker writer, Patrick Radden Keefe. The Sacklers said the website was intended to counter “the many false allegations” by lawyers seeking to “vilify Purdue and the Sackler family”. At the core of the denial is a selective use of statistics to assert that OxyContin never accounted for more than 4% of prescription opioid sales in the US and therefore could not have been a cause of the epidemic. Analysts have called the claim “a legal and a public relations strategy” that cherry-picked data on the sales of individual pills without taking account of the impact of their high narcotic content or their leading role in creating addiction. When the amount of opioid in the drugs is taken into account, OxyContin accounted for about 20% of the market. The Sacklers’ claims are at odds with a wide body of studies into the roots of the epidemic. In 2017, Donald Trump’s presidential Commission on Combatting Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis said Purdue’s “aggressive promotion” of OxyContin, and its broader impact on the use of opioids for pain treatment, was a leading cause of the epidemic. Two years ago, the National Bureau of Economic Research released a study of the impact of OxyContin which concluded that “the introduction and marketing of OxyContin explain a substantial share of overdose deaths over the last two decades”. Purdue used its wealth to influence politicians and regulators, keeping open the floodgates to ever larger prescribing of opioids in the US, far beyond other developed countries, even as the evidence grew of a public health crisis in the making. The billionaire Sacklers face a struggle to restore the reputation of a family whose name is stamped on museums, art galleries and medical centres around the world thanks to their large donations from the profits of OxyContin. Raymond Sackler sat on Purdue’s board from 1990 until his death in 2017. His son, Richard Sackler, was the company’s head of marketing and ramped up sales of OxyContin while painting people who overdosed on the drug as criminals to blame for their own condition. At hearings last year, one member of Congress referred to the Sacklers who own Purdue as the “most evil family in America”, after Kathe Sackler, a powerful former member of Purdue’s board, drew scorn when she said that while “my heart breaks for the parents who have lost their children”, the company was not at fault. “There’s nothing that I can find that I would have done differently,” she said.

Pent-up demand after a year of stop-start activity due to the coronavirus outbreak pushed factory order books to fresh highs in May, adding to previous growth records set in April, according to a bellwether survey of factory owners. Oil prices surged, with Brent crude surpassing $70 a barrel for the first time since March, while US crude hit its highest price in two years. The broad-based recovery increased demand for precious metals such as silver, used in environmentally friendly electric cars and solar panels. With more than half of all US adults fully vaccinated and much of the economy open for business, American manufacturers were able to ramp up production to unprecedented levels and reinforce predictions from some analysts that GDP growth could hit double figures by the end of the year. US president Joe Biden’s $1.9tn stimulus package and the prospect of a multi-trillion infrastructure boost later this year have also fuelled demand from consumers and businesses to push the ISM measure of production activity to 61.2 last month from 60.7 in April, well above the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction. The UK saw even sharper growth in May across its manufacturing sector as factories enjoyed swelling orders books from domestic and foreign buyers. The IHS Markit purchasing managers index (PMI) increased to 65.6, up from 60.9 in April. In continental Europe, Spain and France lagged behind Italy and Germany in the race to secure manufacturing orders, according to the PMIs, after German factories maintained a strong run of increasing output. Mining companies and housebuilding firms – which made gains following an 11% increase in annual house prices – pushed the FTSE 100 index of listed shares back towards last month’s high of 7,129, after closing at 7,083, up almost 1% on the day. A vote of confidence by investors in German companies sent the Dax index to an all-time high of 15,567, up from a low of 8,928 last year as the pandemic struck. The Dow Jones recovered earlier losses to reach 34,656, up 0.4% on the day and well ahead of the 19,173 crash registered in March 2020. MSCI’s index of global stocks rose 2.51 points or 0.35%, to 713.96, marking a record high. Analysts said markets in the UK and US were held back by concerns that vital components and raw materials were in short supply and could put the brake on output growth in the coming months. Some economists have warned that manufacturers will be forced to pass on price rises unless supply-chain bottle necks ease, alleviating pressure on inflation. Inflation in Germany hit 2.4% and the average for the eurozone leapt to the European Central Bank’s 2% target from 1.6% in April, indicating that prices across the 19-member currency bloc are increasing at a rate not seen for two years. Fears of price rises were borne out by a tweet from Elon Musk, the Tesla boss, on Monday which said shortages would force the electric carmaker to increase prices this month, making it the sixth incremental hike this year, according to the Electrek website. Import prices have increased in the US in part due to the declining value of the dollar, which has depressed domestic buying power of foreign goods. The UK has seen the pound increase this year, mainly in response to the Brexit deal with the EU, offsetting the rising cost of oil. Danni Hewson, an AJ Bell financial analyst, said: “Robust figures from the housing market lifted the housebuilding sector while miners were in demand as commodity prices resumed an upwards trajectory.” She said the FTSE’s rise was all the more impressive against the backdrop of the rally in sterling, which also has the effect of depressing the relative worth of the overseas earnings among firms that dominate the index. There was also concern that the recovery could slow later this year unless vaccination programmes are rolled out to developing world nations. In a warning to governments and markets to avoid exuberance, the International Monetary Fund said the current boom could easily falter if mutations of the virus are allowed to spread, especially in developing countries. The Washington-based organisation’s managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, said her proposal for a $50bn plan to end the pandemic was needed to end a situation where fewer than 1% of Africans were vaccinated. She said the $50bn price tag was dwarfed by the estimated $9tn increase in economic activity by 2025 that could be gained, “making it the best public investment ever”.

There is a limited supply of these sorts of houses and in a sellers’ market prices are heading in only one direction: up.</p> <p>The second factor is that borrowing money is cheap and likely to remain so. Dave Ramsden, one of the Bank of England’s deputy governors, says Threadneedle Street is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jun/01/bank-of-england-monitors-uk-housing-boom-as-it-weighs-inflation-risk-dave-ramsden-covid\">closely monitoring house prices</a> for signs of a more generalised inflationary threat, but there is no immediate prospect of borrowing costs being raised.</p> <p>With official interest rates at a record low level of 0.1%, lenders have some tempting offers for potential buyers. It is not hard to find three year 60% loan-to-value mortgages at just below the current inflation rate of 1.5%, which means people moving to a bigger home are effectively borrowing for nothing.</p> <p>The final factor helping to prop up prices is the diminished threat of unemployment. Unemployment is likely to peak at between 5% and 6% later this year, but that’s considerably lower than the forecasts produced this time last year. The people who are looking to sell up in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london\">London</a> for a bigger place in the country are not those most at risk of losing their job.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here’s the full piece:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jun/01/house-price-inflation-continue-hit-young-low-paid\">House price inflation will continue for now, hitting the young and low-paid | Larry Elliott</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60b661388f082ac930ae7227\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-01T16:42:32.676Z\">5.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Opec+ sticks with plan to ease supply curbs</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Opec nations and key allies such as Russia have agreed to continue gradually easing production cuts amid a rebound in oil prices.</strong></p> <p>After a mainly online conference today, the OPEC+ group agreed to lift output in July, as part of their existing plan of gradually increasing supply by 2.1m barrels per day from May to July.</p> <p>But production policy beyond July was not decided on, and the group will meet again on July 1.<br></p> <p>Bloomberg says this has left the market guessing about what will happen beyond July:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>OPEC+ stuck to its plan to hike oil output in July, but Saudi Arabia’s energy minister kept the market guessing as to whether the group will add more supply later this year to keep pace with the accelerating global recovery.</p> <p>“The demand picture has shown clear signs of improvement,” Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said, in some of his most upbeat comments since the crash last year.

Economies are reopening, so the demand for oil is increasing. However, expected oil demand in 2021 is still about five million barrels per day below 2019 levels. During the Covid-19 crisis, OPEC and other major oil producing countries such as Russia absorbed the drop in demand for crude oil by significantly reducing production. This removed 10% of supply from the market.</p> <p>In recent months production has slowly resumed. There are still over nine million barrels per day of spare capacity though. We expect OPEC will opt for a cautious approach to keep the market in balance. Above all it will be afraid of flooding the market with crude oil too soon. We saw confirmation of this earlier in the year when Saudi Arabia offered to unilaterally cut production by an additional one million barrels per day. That being said, in April it decided to increase production by 2.1m barrels per day from May to July in anticipation of a pick-up in global economic growth.</p> <p>It will remain cautious however, thanks to other areas where supply could yet rebound beyond its control. This includes Iran, which is currently producing two million barrels of oil per day but could reach toward 6.5m if a new nuclear deal is agreed with the US.</p> <p>The US itself could also up its capacity as prices rise and shale oil producers come back into play. OPEC will be wary of restarting a price war with those producers that ended so badly for them in 2014 and 2015.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-06-01T15:41:27.862Z\">at 4.41pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-60b61d9c8f08b9889b3657c2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-01T11:55:08.361Z\">12.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The pound has now dropped back from<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2021/jun/01/uk-house-price-growth-factories-supply-chain-inflation-ftse-stock-market-business-live?page=with:block-60b5e4098f086d71cc160c55#block-60b5e4098f086d71cc160c55\"> its three-year high against the US dollar</a>. </strong></p> <p>Having hit $1.4250 early this morning, sterling has now dipped to $1.4175, down a third of a cent.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/britain-sterling/update-1-covid-variant-fears-and-profit-taking-knock-sterling-from-3-year-high-idUSL2N2NJ0L8\"><strong>Reuters</strong> attributes this dip</a> to profit-taking, and some concerns that the UK’s reopening plans could be disrupted by the latest Covid-19 strain, now known as the Delta variant.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We saw some profit taking appear this morning as the market looked to monetise the gains made overnight,” said Stuart Cole, head macro economist at Equiti Capital. </p> </blockquote> <p>Cole added that fears that a Covid variant, first found in India, could delay the next phase of the reopening on June 21 also capped sterling’s gains.<br></p> <p>Inflation fears kept the overnight optimism in check after Bank of England Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden said the central bank is carefully monitoring Britain’s booming housing market.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jun/01/bank-of-england-monitors-uk-housing-boom-as-it-weighs-inflation-risk-dave-ramsden-covid\">Bank of England monitors UK housing boom as it weighs inflation risk</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The government’s former chief scientific adviser, Prof Sir Mark Walport, warned today that the UK is facing a “quite perilous moment” as the Delta coronavirus variant becomes more dominant, accounting for three-quarters of cases.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/01/uk-facing-perilous-moment-as-indian-covid-variant-spreads\">UK facing ‘perilous moment’ as Indian Covid variant spreads</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-06-01T15:43:24.593Z\">at 4.43pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-60b614d68f082ac930ae6d3b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-01T11:26:46.535Z\">12.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e7ff8f27aaa22a0d65ff9f4053b763798a98d0f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e7ff8f27aaa22a0d65ff9f4053b763798a98d0f/0_326_4896_2938/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jammie Dodger biscuits\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Back in UK manufacturing, the firm behind Jammie Dodgers, Wagon Wheels and Maryland Cookies has been sold.</strong><br></p> <p><strong>Burton’s Biscuits</strong> is being acquired by the Ferrero Group (<em>whose <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4P-nZZkQqTc\">Ferrero Rocher adverts at the ambassador’s reception</a> are still fondly remembered here</em>).</p> <p>Burton’s employs around 2,000 people at six production facilities at Blackpool, Dorset, Edinburgh, Livingston, Llantarnam and Isle of Arran, and dates back to 1935.</p> <p>Headquartered in St Albans, is being sold by the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board after eight years. </p> <p>Ferrero, which also makes Nutella and Kinder chocolates, says the deal will expand its sweet biscuits offering, having previously acquired Biscuits Delacre, Kelsen Group and Fox’s.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/food_comm/status/1399660616172834817\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"it\" dir=\"ltr\">Ferrero - CTH accordo per l&#39;acquisizione di Burton&#39;s da Ontario Teachers - <a href=\"https://t.co/8PqW6r6Rh8\">https://t.co/8PqW6r6Rh8</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/aWDXzjM6eL\">pic.twitter.com/aWDXzjM6eL</a></p>&mdash;

A quick recap. Factories in the UK, the eurozone and the US have all posted very rapid growth as demand jumped as lockdown measures are eased. The UK manufacturing PMI, which tracks activity, hit its highest level since the survey began in 1992. The eurozone index also hit a record peak, with output and new orders surging. And with US factories also reporting the strongest PMI reading since at least 2007, and China’s manufacturing growing at its fastest this year, the global index hit an 11-year high. But cost pressures hit firms, forcing them to lift their own prices, while American bosses reported a struggle to find workers. Inflation was also in focus in the eurozone, where the Consumer Prices Index hit 2% for the first time since 2018 - over the ECB’s target. Energy prices were the main factor..... and that trend could continue, with Brent crude hitting $71 per barrel for the first time since March, as Opec+ ministers agreed to continue slowly increasing production. US crude briefly hit its highest since 2018. Opec+ didn’t set a plan for beyond July, though, as they wait to see how demand develops, and if sanctions on Iran are lifted as part of a nuclear deal with the US. Optimism over the recovery drove world stock markets to a fresh record today, with analysts predicting further gains to come. European stock markets hit a new peak tonight, while the FTSE 100 closed at a three-week high as rising commodity prices pushed miners higher. Sterling hit a three-year high against the US dollar in early trading, but is now down half a cent at $1.4155 as traders wonder whether plans to end the lockdown on 21 June will be delayed. Canada’s economy grew slower than expected in Q1, and looks to have contracted by 0.8% in April as new restrictions hit activity. In the UK, house prices surged in May to a new record high, according to Nationwide. Prices rose 10.9% over the last year, with the ‘race for space’ fuelling demand for larger, more rural properties with a garden. My colleague Joanna Partridge writes: Younger house buyers are just as keen on building a new life in the country as they are to move to the bright lights of a big city as they react to the post-pandemic changes under way in working patterns and rapidly rising property prices. Data released on Tuesday by the Nationwide building society showed that demand for property has pushed average house prices up 10.9% over the past year, the fastest pace for almost seven years. Prices rose on average by 1.8% in May, after a 2.3% rise in April, according to the figures, pushing the annual rate of increase up from 7.1% a month earlier. The Bank of England is watching the housing boom closely, deputy governor Sir Dave Ramsden told us: It’s been a busy day in the food sector. The UK firm behind Jammie Dodgers, Wagon Wheels and Maryland Cookies sold to Italy’s Ferrero (so there’ll be some new treats at the ambassador’s reception).... ....and donut maker Krispy Kreme has decided to float on US market after five-year gap. Here are more of today’s stories: Goodnight. GW Global stock markets hit a new record high today, Reuters reports, as investors broadly shrugged off inflation worries. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe rose 2.51 points or 0.35%, to 713.96, marking a new record high, led by broad gains across Europe’s indexes (which hit a new record). Today’s strong factory data also lifted stocks, ahead of a crucial US jobs report on Friday. It could give new clues as to when the US Federal Reserve could start tapering its bond-buying stimulus programme. Reuters adds: “Markets are letting the macroeconomic data lead the way with Treasury prices lower and yields higher after strong numbers this morning,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance in Charlotte, North Carolina, adding that news of oil supplies rapidly drawing down, which will lead to higher oil prices, has prompted traders. Mark Haefele, chief investment cfficer at UBS Global Wealth Management, predicts stocks could have further to rise: Although global stocks are now around 20% above pre-pandemic highs, a combination of strong earnings growth and reasonable valuations relative to still-low bond yields points to further upside for stocks. At a sector level, we reiterate our preference for energy and financials, for which valuations and a supportive macro backdrop point to further catch-up potential following significant underperformance in early 2020.” NatWest Group is preparing for a future where just 13% of staff work from the office full-time, as it becomes the latest major business to plan new remote working rules beyond the pandemic. It means that about 8,300 staff will be expected to commute to the lender’s offices and branches daily, leaving the rest of its 64,000 employees to split their time between home and office, even after the government’s work-at-home orders are lifted. One in three of the bank’s staff – more than 20,000 workers – will be able to live and work anywhere in the UK and have to attend their office in person only two days a month. NatWest chief executive, Alison Rose, told staff last week. “There is no ‘one size fits all’, as not every role is the same.” More here: We started the day with the news that UK house prices surged by nearly 11% over the last year. And tonight, our economics editor, Larry Elliott, writes that three factors are behind the move -- in a double blow to young and the low-paid workers: The first is the race for space, a pandemic-induced desire to find a property which has a garden and a room from which it is possible to work from home. There is a limited supply of these sorts of houses and in a sellers’ market prices are heading in only one direction: up. The second factor is that borrowing money is cheap and likely to remain so. Dave Ramsden, one of the Bank of England’s deputy governors, says Threadneedle Street is closely monitoring house prices for signs of a more generalised inflationary threat, but there is no immediate prospect of borrowing costs being raised. With official interest rates at a record low level of 0.1%, lenders have some tempting offers for potential buyers. It is not hard to find three year 60% loan-to-value mortgages at just below the current inflation rate of 1.5%, which means people moving to a bigger home are effectively borrowing for nothing. The final factor helping to prop up prices is the diminished threat of unemployment. Unemployment is likely to peak at between 5% and 6% later this year, but that’s considerably lower than the forecasts produced this time last year. The people who are looking to sell up in London for a bigger place in the country are not those most at risk of losing their job. Here’s the full piece: Opec nations and key allies such as Russia have agreed to continue gradually easing production cuts amid a rebound in oil prices. After a mainly online conference today, the OPEC+ group agreed to lift output in July, as part of their existing plan of gradually increasing supply by 2.1m barrels per day from May to July. But production policy beyond July was not decided on, and the group will meet again on July 1. Bloomberg says this has left the market guessing about what will happen beyond July: OPEC+ stuck to its plan to hike oil output in July, but Saudi Arabia’s energy minister kept the market guessing as to whether the group will add more supply later this year to keep pace with the accelerating global recovery. “The demand picture has shown clear signs of improvement,” Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said, in some of his most upbeat comments since the crash last year. But pressed on whether more supply increases will be needed, he said: “I will believe it when I see it.” European stocks hit a new record high today, and ended at a closing high too. The Stoxx 600 index of leading European stocks ended 0.75% higher at 450.1 points, with the surge in factory growth last month cheering traders. With oil and commodity prices rising, Energy stocks were the top sector, followed by basic materials (including those FTSE 100 miners), industrial stocks and consumer cyclicals. Ticketing company Trainline was the top Stoxx 600 riser, up 6.6%, having slumped last month after the UK government announced it would run its own ticketing website, as part of rail reform. The Mail on Sunday reported that analysts think Trainline’s overseas arm could be a big growth driver instead. Germany’s DAX gained almost 1% today, with France’s CAC up 0.66%, amid optimism for a strong recovery this year. But....Mihir Kapadia, CEO of Sun Global Investments says investors should be cautious, given concerns about inflation (which rose above target in the eurozone today). However, there are still concerns regarding policymakers, who remain focused on tackling inflation, which could still cap gains for some time. This could be a slow process as we await further economic data but could be crucial in easing expectations and avoiding any unnecessary losses during this period.” Back in London, the FTSE 100 blue-chip index has closed nearly 58 points higher at 7080 points, up 0.8% today. That’s its highest closing level in three weeks, after it hit an intraday three-week high of 7118 points during today’s upbeat session. Miners held their place as the top risers, boosted by stronger commodity prices and hopes of higher demand thanks to the surge in factory activity last month. Anglo American, copper miner Antofagasta and Rio Tinto all gained around 4%, with advertising group WPP up 3.7% and steelmaker Evraz rising 3.3%. The jump in crude oil prices lifted BP (+2.8%) and Royal Dutch Shell (+2%), with Brent at its highest since March and US crude touching the highest since 2018 (although it’s dipped a little since). UK housebuilders also had a good day, with Barratt Development up 2.3% and Persimmon gaining 2.5%. Banking giants HSBC (-2%) and luxury goods maker Burberry (-1.3%) led the fallers, with pharmaceuticals group AstraZeneca (-1.1%), internet security firm Avast (-1%) and online grocery technology firm Ocado (-0.7%) also lower. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, says gains in stock indices have mirrored the sunny UK weather, lifted by the strong factory growth data from China, the eurozone, UK and the US. Growth sectors such as health care and tech stocks continue to struggle compared to the cyclical areas such as mining - where UK commodity prices have driven the gains for the FTSE 100, he says. Investors seem to be largely shrugging off concerns that Covid variants will continue to emerge, or that the UK’s reopening could be delayed, Beauchamp adds: “Fortunately, there is a growing realisation that developed nations must do their part to supply vaccines to others, in a move that would ultimately benefit everyone. “UK reopening plans for 21 June are in doubt thanks to the Delta variant, but for now that does not appear to be hitting risk assets in any significant way even as Scotland revises some of its plans for the lifting of restrictions.” Crunch all today’s factory PMI reports together, and you find that the global manufacturing sector expanded at a robust pace in May. Production rose at one of the fastest rates in a decade, as new order growth accelerated to an 11-year high. The outlook remained positive, with manufacturers forecasting further increases in output over the next 12 months. This pushed the JP Morgan Global Manufacturing PMI to 56.0 in May, up from 55.9 in April, its highest level in over 11 years. Solid improvements in business conditions were seen across the consumer, intermediate and investment goods sectors, with employment up...and price pressures growing as supply chains struggled. Twenty four out of the 30 nations for which May data were available registered better business conditions. Europe was a bright spot in the upturn, with the six top-ranked countries (the Netherlands, Austria, the UK, Germany, Ireland and Italy) located in that region. The US also saw a solid pace of expansion. Subdued growth was registered in Japan, China, Russia and India. The Philippines, Turkey, Thailand, Mexico, Colombia and Myanmar all saw contractions. Wall Street’s early rally is faltering a little, with the S&amp;P 500 now flat and the tech-focused Nasdaq dipping into the red (-0.2%). Transport news: Work to introduce driverless tube trains has been demanded by ministers as part of an emergency funding agreement for Transport for London, with the government injecting just over £1bn to help the capital recover from the pandemic. TfL will be obliged to produce business cases for driverless trains on the Piccadilly and Waterloo and City lines in return for the latest funding, which also comes with a requirement to make £300m of annual cuts and slash pensions. The mayor, Sadiq Khan, said the short-term settlement was a “sticking plaster” and that he had reluctantly agreed to the conditions. However, he promised to fight any further moves to introduce driverless trains, which he said would cost billions of pounds and be a “gross misuse of taxpayers’ money”. Here’s the full story: Labor shortages are now emerging as a key restraint on the US manufacturing sector, says Michael Pearce, senior US economist at Capital Economics: While the headline ISM manufacturing index edged up to 61.2 in May, from 60.7, the main takeaway from the release was that shortages of workers, and not just raw materials, now appear to be playing a key role in holding back production and pushing up prices. Production growth at US factories accelerated last month as client demand increased, two surveys have shown. But firms also reported significant supply chain disruption, backlogs of work, and problems hiring staff. IHS Markit’s US manufacturing PMI has come in at 62.1 in May, up from 60.5 in April, and above the earlier ‘flash’ estimate of 61.5. That shows rapid growth – as we’ve seen in the UK and eurozone already today. The PMI survey found that: Output expanded at faster rate as growth in new order inflows strengthens Supply chain disruption lead to soaring cost pressures Backlogs of work rose at quickest pace on record New orders increased at the fastest pace since the survey began in 2007, lifted by both domestic and foreign client demand. This upturn was often linked to the loosening of Covid-19 restrictions and successful vaccine rollouts, which led to stronger demand conditions. But cost pressures surged, leading manufacturers to lift their own prices at the fastest rate in the survey’s 14-year history. The rate of job creation slowed to the softest since December 2020, with some companies reporting problems finding suitable staff to fill vacancies. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said: US manufacturers are enjoying a bumper second quarter, with the PMI hitting a new high for the second month running in May. Inflows of new orders are surging at a rate unsurpassed in 14 years of survey history, buoyed by reviving domestic demand and record export sales as economies reopen from Covid-19 restrictions. However, elevated levels of other survey indicators are less welcome: prices charged by manufacturers are also rising at an unprecedented rate, linked to soaring input costs and unparalleled capacity constraints. Not only is operating capacity being curbed by record supply chain delays so far in the second quarter, but firms have also been increasingly unable to hire sufficient staff. Hence backlogs of work are building up at an unprecedented rate, as firms struggle to meet demand. The Institute of Supply Management’s manufacturing PMI survey tells a very similar picture. It jumped to 61.2 in May, from April’s 60.7 - again showing rapid growth, but with work backlogs rising and firms struggling to find staff. The key points are: New Orders, Production &amp; Employment Growing; Supplier Deliveries Slowing at Faster Rate; Backlog Growing (continuing at a record high) Raw Materials Inventories Growing; Customers’ Inventories Too Low (at an all-time low) Prices Increasing; Exports and Imports Growing ISM’s Employment Index expanded for the sixth straight month, but panelists continue to note significant difficulties in attracting and retaining staff, at their own companies and at suppliers. In New York, stocks have begun June on the front foot. The main indices are all higher as trading resumes after yesterday’s Memorial Day holiday, pushing the S&amp;P 500 index near to record levels. Dow: up 150 points or 0.44% at 34,680 S&amp;P 500: up 15 points or 0.35% at 4,219 Nasdaq Composite: up 53 points or 0.4% at 13,802 Oil stocks are sharply higher, following the jump in crude prices today. Devon Energy (+12.2%) and Marathon Oil (+11%) are leading the S&amp;P 500 risers. On the Dow, the oil producer Chevron (+2.8%) is the top riser, followed by the aerospace manufacturer Boeing (2.8%), the investment bank Goldman Sachs (+1.6%) the and financial services firm American Express (+1.6%). Corrections corner: I mangled Olaf van den Heuvel’s job title in the Brent crude oil entry earlier. To clarify, he’s CIO Aegon AM NL. Now fixed. Apologies. The jump in crude oil is likely to mean higher energy and transport bills for consumers and businesses, putting upward pressure on inflation. But the good news today, for small firms and organisations, is that they shouldn’t be ripped off by unscrupulous energy brokers. Ofgem, the energy regulator, is forcing brokers to reveal their hidden commission fees, to protect more than a million microbusinesses from being overcharged. My colleague Jillian Ambrose explains: All energy brokers will need to disclose how much commission they stand to earn from their services after some rogue brokers conned charities, church groups and care homes by locking them into long-term bad-value gas and electricity contracts. Ofgem hopes to root out these “poor practices” by forcing brokers to disclose their full commission fees upfront, and by offering microbusiness customers a 14-day cooling-off period after signing a new energy deal. The regulator is setting out the measures almost 18 months after it was made aware that some energy brokers may have overcharged ultra-small companies by up to £2bn by hiding their commission fees. Canada’s economy grew slower than expected in the first quarter of this year, and appears to have contracted in April. Canadian GDP increased by 1.4% during the January-March period, new data shows, down from the 2.2% growth seen in October-December 2020 The economy picked up in March, growing 1.1% after 0.4% growth in February, but is still around 1% smaller than before the pandemic. Statistics Canada says March’s expansion was the 11th consecutive monthly increase, after the steepest drops in Canadian economic activity on record in March and April 2020. But it also estimates that GDP fell in April, by around 0.8%, due to restrictions introduced to restrict the Covid-19 virus. Declines in retail trade and accommodation and food services reflect in part additional public health measures in some parts of the country. There are also notable declines in manufacturing, real estate and rental and leasing, and educational services. US crude price are rallying too, hitting their highest levels since October 2018. Predictions that the oil market is tightening this summer are driving crude prices up, Bloomberg says: US crude futures climbed to the highest in more than two-and-a-half years after the OPEC+ alliance forecast a tightening global market, while international efforts to revive a nuclear deal with Iran were yet to reach a breakthrough. West Texas Intermediate rose as much as 3.2% from Friday’s close to $68.42 a barrel, while global benchmark Brent topped $70, a level it has failed to hold for a sustained period since 2019. The oil glut built up during the coronavirus pandemic has almost gone and stockpiles will slide rapidly in the second half of the year, according to an assessment of the market from an OPEC+ committee. A ministerial group is gathering in Vienna, before a full meeting that is expected to ratify a scheduled output increase for July. Brent crude has hit its highest level in almost three months, as oil ministers from Opec countries and their allies prepare to decide whether to lift production. Brent is up over 2% today, hitting $71 per barrel for the first time since early March. The Opec+ group, led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, are expected to stick to their plan of gradually relaxing supply curbs, as they await to see whether Iran’s production increases (if a nuclear deal with the US is agreed). Factory data from China earlier today, showing the fastest growth this year, is also positive for oil demand, as are the record manufacturing PMI readings from the eurozone and UK this morning. Olaf van den Heuvel, CIO at Aegon AM NL, expects OPEC will attempt to stabilise oil prices as spare capacity responds to rising demand, rather than boost supply too fast and risk another price war. Commodity prices are in the spotlight because of rising inflation. Economies are reopening, so the demand for oil is increasing. However, expected oil demand in 2021 is still about five million barrels per day below 2019 levels. During the Covid-19 crisis, OPEC and other major oil producing countries such as Russia absorbed the drop in demand for crude oil by significantly reducing production. This removed 10% of supply from the market. In recent months production has slowly resumed. There are still over nine million barrels per day of spare capacity though. We expect OPEC will opt for a cautious approach to keep the market in balance. Above all it will be afraid of flooding the market with crude oil too soon. We saw confirmation of this earlier in the year when Saudi Arabia offered to unilaterally cut production by an additional one million barrels per day. That being said, in April it decided to increase production by 2.1m barrels per day from May to July in anticipation of a pick-up in global economic growth. It will remain cautious however, thanks to other areas where supply could yet rebound beyond its control. This includes Iran, which is currently producing two million barrels of oil per day but could reach toward 6.5m if a new nuclear deal is agreed with the US. The US itself could also up its capacity as prices rise and shale oil producers come back into play. OPEC will be wary of restarting a price war with those producers that ended so badly for them in 2014 and 2015. The pound has now dropped back from its three-year high against the US dollar. Having hit $1.4250 early this morning, sterling has now dipped to $1.4175, down a third of a cent. Reuters attributes this dip to profit-taking, and some concerns that the UK’s reopening plans could be disrupted by the latest Covid-19 strain, now known as the Delta variant. We saw some profit taking appear this morning as the market looked to monetise the gains made overnight,” said Stuart Cole, head macro economist at Equiti Capital. Cole added that fears that a Covid variant, first found in India, could delay the next phase of the reopening on June 21 also capped sterling’s gains. Inflation fears kept the overnight optimism in check after Bank of England Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden said the central bank is carefully monitoring Britain’s booming housing market. The government’s former chief scientific adviser, Prof Sir Mark Walport, warned today that the UK is facing a “quite perilous moment” as the Delta coronavirus variant becomes more dominant, accounting for three-quarters of cases. Back in UK manufacturing, the firm behind Jammie Dodgers, Wagon Wheels and Maryland Cookies has been sold. Burton’s Biscuits is being acquired by the Ferrero Group (whose Ferrero Rocher adverts at the ambassador’s reception are still fondly remembered here). Burton’s employs around 2,000 people at six production facilities at Blackpool, Dorset, Edinburgh, Livingston, Llantarnam and Isle of Arran, and dates back to 1935. Headquartered in St Albans, is being sold by the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board after eight years. Ferrero, which also makes Nutella and Kinder chocolates, says the deal will expand its sweet biscuits offering, having previously acquired Biscuits Delacre, Kelsen Group and Fox’s. Nick Jansa, senior managing director at Ontario Teachers’, says Burton’s is ‘well positioned’ for success: We’re proud to have supported Burton’s and overseen the significant growth of this leading UK biscuit manufacturer. Since our investment, Burton’s has implemented key organic growth initiatives and completed a number of strategic acquisitions to further strengthen its portfolio and manufacturing capability. Eurozone inflation is now (just) above target for the first time since October 2018. Charles Hepworth, investment director at GAM Investments, says the European Central Bank should welcome this move (it’s been trying stimulate prices and ward of deflation). Consumers probably won’t share this feeling, but Hepworth doesn’t think higher inflation will be permanent. The resurgent demand coming about from partial reopening of the bloc’s economy highlights the ongoing supply constraints in some parts of the economy. The ECB however will be more than pleased that inflation is at its implied target level, although how long it persists is open to huge debate, as witnessed in volatility seen across markets since the spectre of higher inflation emerged this year. Higher input costs will inevitably lead to a modest inflation overshoot in the short term but the continuation of monetary largesse, which doesn’t seem to be looking to be withdrawn any time soon, is arguably the deciding factor on the medium-term inflation rate. We see higher inflation as being a transient one-off supply led issue and not something that should spook investors in the medium term. Inflation across the eurozone has accelerated above the European Central Bank’s target, as rising prices hit consumers. The annual eurozone consumer prices index rose by 2% in May, flash data shows, up from 1.6% in April. Energy prices were the biggest factor, surging by 13.1% over the last year (as crude prices recover from their slump early in the pandemic). Service sector firms also raised their prices, with annual services inflation rising to 1.1% from 0.9% in April, while non-energy industrial goods rose 0.7% and food, alcohol &amp; tobacco were 0.6% higher than a year ago. This takes inflation above the ECB’s inflation target of ‘close to, but below 2%’, and could intensify pressure from more hawkish policymakers to slow its pandemic bond-buying stimulus programme. Eurostat has also reported that unemployment across the eurozone fell in April, to 8.0% from 8.1% in March. However, that’s still higher than a year ago (it was 7.3% in April 2020), due to the heavy job losses caused by Covid-19. That shows that the economic damage of the pandemic has yet to heal (especially with the eurozone falling into recession last quarter). It adds: Eurostat estimates that 15.380 million men and women in the EU, of whom 13.030 million in the euro area, were unemployed in April 2021. Compared with March 2021, the number of persons unemployed decreased by 165 000 in the EU and by 134 000 in the euro area. Compared with April 2020, unemployment rose by 1.406 million in the EU and by 1.275 million in the euro area. UK factories might growing even faster if they weren’t constrained by supply chain problems, says Mike Thornton, partner and head of manufacturing at accountancy giant RSM. He says supply shortages are now biting, as firms consume stocks built up ahead of the Brexit deadline at the end of 2020. It’s great to see another increase in the latest CIPS Manufacturing PMI to a record high of 65.6 from 60.9; and reinforces the important role that UK manufacturing will play in the economic recovery this year. It also demonstrates the resilience of manufacturers in a chaotic market; but supply chain disruption is really starting to bite now. Not only is there a shortage of certain components which is stalling production, but the cost of shipping certain products or materials is through the roof. This extra expense is the last thing manufacturers need as they try to trade out of unprecedented times. Brexit stockpiling has cushioned the blow for many manufacturers at the start of the year; but as stocks dwindle and supply chain disruption remains, we could see further pressure on input costs and production – pushing prices up even further for consumers. It’s such a shame that post-Brexit and pandemic supply chain disruption could curb economic growth at a time when manufacturers are looking to maximise the opportunity of pent up consumer spend.’ The Office for National Statistics has reported that the number of companies citing Brexit as their main challenge rose at the start of the year – replacing Covid-19 as the biggest problem for the largest proportion of firms. Here’s a good snap summary of the purchasing manager survey, from EY Item Club’s Howard Archer: By surging to 65.6 in May, the UK manufacturing PMI has burst above July 1994’s previous record high of 61.0, as well as April’s reading of 60.9. It’s now signalled an improvement in the factory sector for the last 12 months, following the first lockdown in April and May 2020. A surge of new orders has helped Britain’s factory sector to post a record increase in activity last month, as the easing of lockdown restrictions boosted demand. The UK Manufacturing PMI jumped to 65.6 in May, up from 60.9 in April, and the highest since the survey began in 1992 (any reading over 50 shows growth). IHS Markit, which compiles the survey, reports that conditions in the manufacturing sector improved at an unprecedented rate in May. Output growth strengthened, and new orders rose at the quickest pace on record. Markit says: Companies linked new order growth to rising business confidence, the further re-opening of the UK economy and reduced issues relating to Covid-19. New export orders also rose at a survey-record pace in May, amid reports of stronger demand from the EU, the US and China. But while large companies saw record gains in new export work, small firms only saw a smaller rise. Employment jumped at a record pace, with manufacturers taking on staff to handle high levels of pent-up demand. Supply disruption was a growing problem too, with companies reporting shortages of electronics, plastics and metals, transport delays and higher demand for raw materials. This drove up input costs at a record pace, leading to an unprecedented rise in output prices too, in a further sign that inflationary pressures are building. Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, said UK factories benefited from the easing of lockdown restrictions, as vaccine rollouts help economies unlock. But he also warns that consumers will see higher prices, as the jump in input costs is passed on. The UK PMI surged to an unprecedented high in May, as record growth of new orders and employment supported one of the steepest increases in production volumes in the near 30-year survey history. Growth is being boosted by the unlocking of economies from Covid restrictions and ongoing vaccination programs. This is being felt across the globe, as highlighted by a record rise in new export business during the latest survey month. The corollaries of this strong upsurge in industrial activity are increased strain on supply chains and a build-up of price pressures. Supplies of inputs into manufacturers and finished goods on to clients are both being severely disrupted by raw material shortages, port issues, Covid restrictions, post-Brexit difficulties and market forces as demand outstrips supply. Suppliers’ delivery times subsequently lengthened to one of the greatest extents on record, while input costs and selling prices both rose at unprecedented rates. With little sign of supply pressures receding, these price rises will become more visible to consumers. Back on the housing market boom ... the Resolution Foundation flags up that prices are rising fastest in the less populated parts of the UK, confirming that the ‘race for space’ is happening. Resolution’s research, released last month, found that house prices in the least-densely populated areas of the UK have risen almost twice as much as those in the most-densely populated areas over the past year. Demand for rural properties, or those with a garden, have jumped during the lockdown and the move to more home working. Domino’s Pizza is aiming to hire 5,000 chefs and delivery drivers, as consumers’ appetite for takeaways remains strong, at a time when the hospitality industry is battling staff shortages. Britain’s biggest pizza delivery chain said it had recruited just over 8,000 people in 2020 to meet demand, including hairdressers, taxi drivers and event managers who were not able to work as usual during lockdown. However, as Covid restrictions ease, some of Domino’s pandemic recruits are returning to their previous roles. As a result, the chain needs more staff for its 1,100 UK branches, most of which are run by franchisees. The firm has previously announced plans to open a further 200 outlets. Domino’s search for new employees comes amid warnings from the hospitality industry that it is facing a staffing crisis, with businesses trying to fill thousands of vacancies. Domino’s was “overwhelmed by the response from people of all walks of life” during last year’s recruitment drive, said Nicola Frampton, operations director at Domino’s UK. Frampton added. I’m proud we were able to play a part by offering people the opportunity to continue working and earning when times were tough. But as people start to reunite, customer demand is showing no signs of slowing and so we’re now looking for 5,000 new recruits. Here’s the full story: The UK sub-prime lender Amigo is facing insolvency after the high court rejected a controversial rescue plan last week. Amigo told the City this morning that it will not appeal against the court’s ruling, which concluded that its proposal to cut compensation payouts to customers for mis-selling loans was unfair. Amigo added that its board are considering all options, including insolvency, saying: The Board of Amigo continues to consider all options, which includes insolvency, and whether it might be possible and appropriate, given the cost of a scheme, to promote another scheme of arrangement to avoid insolvency. The UK’s financial watchdog, the FCA, opposed the original scheme of arrangement proposed by Amigo, which charges 49.9% interest and requires borrowers to provide a friend or family member to act as a guarantor for a loan. Under the plan, the compensation pool for those missold loans was capped while directors could earn £7m in long-term bonuses. Gary Jennison, chief executive officer of Amigo, said today: Without a scheme, Amigo faces insolvency as it will be unable to satisfy its customer compensation claims as well as meeting the legally binding funding obligations owed to its secured creditors. The Board is committed to finding the best solution it can for Amigo’s customers and other stakeholders and will be working with its stakeholders, including the FCA, to achieve that solution as quickly as it can. Amigo shares are down 8% this morning at around 7.6p, near to its record lows, having halved last week after the court ruling. It floated on the stock market in 2018 at 275p... The FTSE 100 index has jumped 1% this morning, amid hopes of a strong recovery from the pandemic. The blue-chip FTSE 100 index is currently up 75 points to 7,097, near to the pandemic highs hit last month, with almost every stock gaining ground. Mining companies are leading the risers, with iron ore jumping today amid reports that China could be relaxing recent restrictions on steelmakers in its Tangshan region. The weaker dollar is also pushing up commodity prices, boosting Anglo American (+4.5%), Rio Tinto (+4%), Glencore (+3.4%) and BHP Group (+3.4%). Housebuilders such as Persimmon (+2.4%), Barratt Development (+1.7%) and Taylor Wimpey (+1.2%) are also rallying, after Nationwide reported that house prices jumped sharply again in May. AJ Bell financial analyst Danni Hewson says: Robust figures from the housing market lifted the housebuilding sector while miners were in demand as commodity prices resumed an upwards trajectory. The FTSE’s rise was all the more impressive when you consider it came against the backdrop of a recovery-inspired rally in sterling. A strong pound dulls the relative worth of the overseas earnings which dominate the index. Europe’s Stoxx 600 share index has hit a new high this morning, rising by over 0.8% to 450.79 points. The eurozone manufacturing PMI has hit a new record high, as factory activity surged and inflationary pressures build up. Data firm IHS Markit has reported that its eurozone manufacturing purchasing manager’s index, which tracks activity across the sector, hit 63.1 in May, up from April’s 62.9. That’s its highest reading since the survey began in 1997 (any reading over 50 shows growth). Firms reported a slight slowdown in output and new orders, but growth rates remained near the record levels set earlier this year. There was also a record deterioration in vendor delivery times, as suppliers struggled to meet demand, which pushed up raw materials costs and forced companies to hike their own prices. Markit says: On the price front, average input costs again rose substantially, with the rate of inflation hitting an unprecedented level in line with widespread product shortages. Boosted by strong market demand, manufacturers took advantage of improved pricing power by raising their own charges at the fastest rate in more than 18 years of data availability. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, says the data suggests the eurozone will grow strongly this summer, and also see a sharp rise in inflation: Eurozone manufacturing continues to grow at a rate unprecedented in almost 24 years of survey history, the PMI breaking new records for a third month in a row. Surging output growth adds to signs that the economy is rebounding strongly in the second quarter. However, May also saw record supply delays, which are constraining output growth and leaving firms unable to meet demand to a degree not previously witnessed by the survey. In the financial markets, sterling has hit its highest level against the US dollar in three years. The pound traded as high as $1.4248 early this morning, its highest level since April 2018 (which was the highest since the 2016 EU referendum). This rally comes despite concerns about a potential third wave of Covid-19, due to rising cases of the new variant, called B.1.617.2, Bloomberg reports that traders are betting that the UK’s fast vaccine rollout will help the recovery gain traction: “The pound is favoured because the progress of vaccination puts the UK closer to economic normalisation than other countries,” said Toshiya Yamauchi, chief manager for foreign-exchange margin trading at Ueda Harlow, in Tokyo. Sterling could climb toward $1.45. Economic optimism has also lifted sterling recently, with consumer confidence strengthening, retail sales rising and company output picking up as lockdown restrictions were eased. Yesterday, the OECD predicted that the UK economy would expand by 7.2% this year, a strong bounceback, which would be the fastest since 1941. The dollar, though, has been pushed down by the huge US stimulus spending packages and the Federal Reserve’s pledge not to tighten monetary policy until it sees more progress on unemployment. Last week it hit a three-year low against China’s yuan, despite Beijing’s efforts to avoid its currency strengthening too quickly (which could hit export growth). The shortage of larger, more rural houses on the market is helping to push up prices strongly, says Nicky Stevenson, managing director at national estate agent group Fine &amp; Country: Many current buyers are those who delayed a move last year and would have been forgiven for thinking that competition would have cooled by now. Instead, they find themselves in an even tighter race as demand continues to outstrip supply. The buyers driving the market higher are still those looking for more space. Forever homes are still the order of the day and buyers are more than willing to do everything in their power to secure what they truly desire. There just aren’t enough of these larger properties coming on to the market in the right areas and there’s no sign this imbalance is going to resolve itself in time to suppress strong growth over the summer. But Guy Harrington, CEO of residential lender Glenhawk, predicts that the pace of growth will slow, especially if a third wave of Covid-19 cases hits the UK. The disconnect between the UK housing market and economic reality appears as great as ever. Government stimulus has created a false sense of consumer confidence. Iain McKenzie, CEO of The Guild of Property Professionals, says there’s a ‘frenzy’ in the housing market, with some buyers bolstered by lockdown savings: At a time when much of the country seems to be enjoying a sense of normality once again, we would expect the property market to follow suit. Today’s figures show that the market didn’t get the memo. The frenzy to snap up a property at the tail end of a pandemic is showing no signs of stopping, with double-digit growth in house prices throughout May – the highest we have seen in the best part of a decade. The success of the stamp duty holiday has certainly played its part, as well as the savings many have made while working from home. With a record-breaking new average house price, which has grown almost £24,000 over the past 12 months, it’s worth thinking about how your potential savings might not outweigh the inflated price of your new home. It is still crucial that prospective buyers go into the process with a sound understanding of the market and what they want from a new property. As demand in the market increases, the extra competition creates a fear of missing out that can distract buyers from the fundamentals. It’s important not to let the current property frenzy draw attention away from what you are really looking for. Nationwide also predicts that house prices could “accelerate further” in the coming months. The ‘race for space’, record low interest rates, and the stamp duty holiday (which will fall from £500,000 to £250,000 at the end of June, and finish three months later) could all drive activity, making it even harder for first-time buyers to get onto the housing ladder. But the market could then slow, if the end of the furlough scheme pushed up unemployment. Chief economist Robert Gardner explains: “Housing market activity is likely to remain fairly buoyant over the next six months as a result of the stamp duty extension and additional support for the labour market included in the Budget, especially given continued low borrowing costs, improving credit availability and with many people still motivated to move as a result of changing housing preferences in the wake of the pandemic. “With the stock of homes on the market constrained, there is scope for annual house price growth to accelerate further in the coming months, especially given the low base for comparison in early summer last year. Further ahead, the outlook for the market is far more uncertain. If unemployment rises sharply towards the end of the year as most analysts expect, there is scope for activity to slow, perhaps sharply, though even this could potentially be offset by ongoing shifts in housing preferences, if current trends are maintained. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The UK housing boom continues to run, with house price inflation accelerating again as the pandemic spurs people to move to larger properties in more rural areas. Figures released by Nationwide this morning show that annual house price growth jumped to 10.9% in May, up from 7.1%/year in April, pushing the new average price to a new peak. It says: Annual house price growth rises to 10.9%, the highest level in nearly seven years Prices up 1.8% month-on-month, following a 2.3% rise in April New record average price of £242,832, up £23,930 over the past twelve months Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist, says the housing market has seen a “complete turnaround over the past twelve months” since the first lockdown temporarily froze the market, with transactions reaching a record high of 183,000 in March: Gardner adds that Nationwide’s research shows that pressure for more space, or a garden, is the primary factor driving the market this spring. “Amongst homeowners surveyed at the end of April that were either moving home or considering a move, more than two thirds (68%) said this would have been the case even if the stamp duty holiday had not been extended. It is shifting housing preferences which is continuing to drive activity, with people reassessing their needs in the wake of the pandemic. Nationwide says the ‘race for space’ continues to drive demand. Of those moving or considering a move, around a third (33%) were looking to move to a different area, while nearly 30% were doing so to access a garden or outdoor space more easily, according to an online survey of consumers. Gardner adds: “Over a third (36%) of those surveyed said they were more likely to consider enhancing their home as a result of Covid19, with nearly half (46%) of these looking to add or maximise space. Faster broadband was another factor, with the move to home working and home schooling during lockdown showing the value of a good web connection. Nationwide’s results will interest the Bank of England, which is carefully monitoring Britain’s booming housing market as it weighs up the possibility that a rapid recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic will lead to a sustained period of inflation. In an interview with the Guardian today, deputy governor Sir Dave Ramsden said the Bank expected price pressures to be temporary but he and his colleagues on Threadneedle Street’s monetary policy committee were aware of the risks. Ramsden, the deputy governor responsible for markets and banking, said: “There is a risk that demand gets ahead of supply and that will lead to a more generalised pick-up in inflationary pressure. That’s something we are absolutely going to guard against. We are looking carefully at the housing market and a raft of real-term indicators.” Also coming up today Surveys of factory purchasing managers in the eurozone, UK and US are expected to show strong growth last month, and squeezed supply chains pushing up prices. Oil ministers from the Opec+ group will hold a video call today to assess the latest developments in the global markets. They’re expected to stick to the existing pace of gradually easing oil supply curbs, as demand picks up -- which has already pushed UK petrol prices up for six months in a row. Crude prices have risen overnight, with Brent crude rising over $70 per barrel.

Portugal is the only mass tourism destination where no quarantine is required on either leg, but operators are pinning hopes on the reopening of holiday islands such as Malta, the Canaries or the Balearics, even if mainland Spain remains on the amber list.

Vietnam’s containment of coronavirus had been a worldwide success story until the past few months, when cases have risen. The country has recorded about 7,000 total cases, with 47 deaths. Vietnam’s health minister, Nguyễn Thanh Long, said on Saturday that a variant had been detected combining characteristics of two existing variants first found in India and the UK. The Telegraph reported analysis by Robert Boyle, a BA strategist, suggesting Bahrain, Costa Rica, Trinidad and Tobago and Kuwait could also be added to the red list because of their case rates. Heathrow airport in London has reopened a dedicated terminal for red-list passengers after significant concerns were raised about people mixing at border control. Currently the red list requires hotel quarantine for arrivals from countries including India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Brazil, South Africa, the UAE and Turkey. From Tuesday, red-list arrivals will pass through the airport’s Terminal 3, which has been closed since April 2020 due to plummeting visitor

The Australian Academy of Science says some $824m will be needed over the next 25 years to complete a mammoth task becoming more urgent as the climate crisis puts more species at risk of extinction. Economic research commissioned by the academy and released today argues every dollar spent on the taxonomy mission could deliver between $4 and $35 in benefits. Australia is estimated to have 750,000 different species of plants, animals and insects, but about 70% are either undiscovered or have not been formally described in the scientific literature. The academy’s proposal would see all of Australia’s species properly documented and recorded over the next 25 years. The Deloitte Access Economics report says such a mission could deliver between $3.7bn and $28.9bn in economic returns over the next 25 years. Economic benefits include the discovery of new drugs, improvements to biosecurity with invasive species easier to identify, and new crops developed from hybridisation of newly discovered species. Associate Prof Kevin Thiele, director of the academy’s Taxonomy Australia organisation, said: “Every species that is lost – especially those lost before we even find them – is a lost opportunity. “If we don’t even know what 70% of the species are, how can we answer the question of whether we’re conserving biodiversity or not?” Taxonomy is the field of science that finds, documents and then describes new species and is a foundation for understanding the natural world and conserving it. Thiele said so little was known about Australia’s biodiversity that at current rates it would take 400 years to describe all the species that scientists think are on land, in rivers and oceans, and in the air. Thiele, who is a plant specialist, said he was currently working on about 20 new species. But he said scientific advancements in genetics and machine learning had created an opportunity to massively scale-up the field of taxonomy and expand the pipeline of the discovery of new species. “Now is the first time in history that we can do this,” he said. “But as well, there is enormous need because [of] climate change and all the other stresses [on the natural world].” The $824m the academy’s report says is needed, includes money to double the workforce of taxonomists and provide funds for research and field operations. Thiele said it would need a collaborative effort from state and commonwealth government agencies, philanthropists and industry to gather enough funds. He said funding of that size was “not out of the ordinary”, with space missions and particle physics projects costing many times more. The Deloitte report says: “Climate change, including rapid onset disasters such as the bushfires experienced in the summer of 2019-20, is accelerating the extinction of species from the planet. Many species will disappear without ever having been known to humankind.” Research published on Wednesday in the journal PLOS Biology has found a large backlog and taxonomic uncertainties in almost 300 snakes and lizards. Dr Jane Melville, the lead author and senior curator of terrestrial vertebrates at Museums Victoria, said many species had been described in science a century ago. In reality, some of those described species were likely an umbrella of several distinct animals. Some 24 “species” needed urgent taxonomic research, Melville said, as there was a likelihood that those classifications contained distinct species that were already threatened with extinction. In 2019, Melville’s research found that a lizard species – the grassland earless dragon – was in fact four different species, and one isolated around Melbourne and Geelong may already have disappeared. Prof Tim Entwisle, the director of Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria and president of the International Association of Botanic Gardens, said: “As a plant scientist and head of a botanic garden, I’m very aware that being able to identify and name a plant unlocks a vast array of benefits to that plant and to us. “We need to discover and classify life on Earth so that species can survive in a changing world, so that we can control weeds and diseases, and so that we can develop new pharmaceuticals and agricultural crops. “It’s time we took this Cinderella of sciences (taxonomy) seriously.” Queensland’s chief scientist, Prof Hugh Possingham, said the report showed the benefits of using economics to support conservation. “The economic thinking in these papers helps us to understand biodiversity and manage Australia’s rich natural heritage far more efficiently; plus, it shows the enormous benefits to Australia of increased investment in science and science-informed actions.” A spokesman for the federal environment minister, Sussan Ley, said the government was “already working towards a comprehensive understanding of Australia’s biological diversity”. More than $56m had been invested across the Australian Biological Resources Study’s (ABRS) National Taxonomy Research Grant Program, Parks Australia’s Annual Bush Blitz and the Centre for Australian National Biodiversity Research, which he said provides Australia’s funding and support for taxonomy and systematics research. Parks Australia’s Bush Blitz had led to the discovery of more than 1,780 species new to science since its inception in 2010. Over the past decade ABRS had facilitated the revision of approximately 2,016 taxa and the description of 1,106 new taxa, “adding significantly to our knowledge and understanding of Australia’s flora and fauna”.

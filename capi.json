Nadal, the 13-times French Open champion, will go into battle later today against Cameron Norrie, the British No 2, while Djokovic takes on Ricardas Berankis of Lithuania and Federer meets the left-handed German Dominik Koepfer. </p> <p>British fans will be fascinated to see how Norrie gets on: he was impressively consistent in his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/jun/03/cameron-norrie-wins-at-french-open-to-set-up-potential-tennis-clash-with-rafael-nadal\">second-round win against Lloyd Harris</a>, but will he have the weapons to trouble the king of clay? We will find out from around 1.15pm.</p> <p>In the women’s competition, a few big names have admittedly fallen early: Naomi Osaka withdrew, sparking a global debate about mental health and media coverage which rumbles on, while Ash Barty, the world No 1, was forced to retire from the tournament with a hip injury. The reigning champion Iga Swiatek of Poland is still very much in contention, however, in ominous form, and is clearly feeling increasingly confident about a second title. Swiatek faces a potentially tricky tie against 30th seed Estonian Anett Kontaveit this afternoon, scheduled on court at 3pm. Barbora Krejcikova will be the opposition for Elina Svitolina (5) on Philippe-Chatrier from 11am, while the fourth seed Sofia Kenin meets her American compatriot Jessica Pegula on Court Suzanne Lenglen. Coco Gauff v Jennifer Brady is another all-American affair from 3.15pm.</p> <p>There is light cloud covering Paris at the moment but no rain is expected, and the sun is scheduled to peep through the clouds later in the day. Let’s get started!</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-06-05T09:15:01.822Z\">at 10.15am BST</time></p>  </div>","wordcount":"2449","firstPublicationDate":"2021-06-05T09:02:52Z","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2021-06-05T11:25:23Z","liveBloggingNow":"true","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/p/hktdb","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/f625fceb5f40916947389335997dc8fe0bcf0ede/260_332_2385_1432/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","isLive":"true","bodyText":"Now, to Court Philippe-Chatrier, where a shock is brewing: Barbora Krejcikova of the Czech Republic is 2-0 up against fifth seed Elina Svitolina in the second set, after winning the first set 6-3. The first set featured a 20-minute service game for Krejcikova which she eventually held. She has hit 30 winners so far. Cédric Pioline, on post-match interview duty, tells the 10th seed Schwartzman that the crowd love him. “It’s a very special place to me,” Schwartzman tells Pioline of his feelings for Roland Garros as the cheers ring out. “I’m very happy to be back, to play my best tennis again, and with a crowd. Last year was my best tournament here, but not many people could come [due to lockdown] and I’m very happy to play with a lot of people here this week. “I was thinking to play every single point, as many shots I can ... he [Kohlschreiber] was not playing a lot of tournaments since last year ... so I was thinking to play a long match ... at the end, he was not running very well. “Now we can have time to walk around Paris this afternoon. I’m very happy, because now I have two days [off] before the second week here in Paris. Everything is perfect right now.” The diminutive Argentinian smokes a forehand down the line, and seals an utterly dominant win against the 37-year-old German. Schwartzman, the Argentinian, is 5-1 up in his third set against Kohlschreiber on Court Suzanne Lenglen. He angles a beautiful cushioned volley across court, and a point later, he has his first match point ... he sends the ball long, though, and it’s back to deuce on Kohlschreiber’s serve. That was a very, very entertaining two hours of tennis. Muchova sends a forehand long and Stephens is through with a top-drawer performance. Can the 2018 runner-up do something special this year? Stephens gives Muchova a smile as they shake hands - and then a big round of applause as the Czech leaves the court. A great spirit between the players - and a fine display of hitting from both of them. Muchova hits a blinding forehand winner. Stephens answers straight back, and has two match points. Stephens speeds to 30-0 and is two points away from the last 16 ... Stephens breaks! 6-5 to the resurgent American now, and she can serve for the match. Schwartzman is now 3-1 up against Kohlschreiber and seemingly easing to a straight-sets win. Stephens v Muchova is a much more interesting spectacle. Lovely variation now from Stephens, who produces a drop shot of her own: Muchova sprints and gets it back, but Stephens clumps a confident volleyed winner back into the open court. She now has three break points! Stephens holds for 5-5. Krejcikova and Svitolina are playing a marathon first set - it’s 4-3 there at the moment, Krejcikova with the second break and serving for 5-3. Whoah! Fantastic forehand winner down the line, on the slide, from Muchova and she creates a sniff of a chance at 40-30 on the Stephens serve. And now she takes it to deuce with another excellently-judged drop shot. Another classy drop shot from Muchova early in this service game from Stephens. But Stephens moves to 40-15 with a tremendous, powerful forehand that Muchova - attacking the net - cannot get back. Muchova digs out the game for 5-4. It’s been excellent from both players, this match. And that is a really gritty and calm effort from Muchova to fight back from 15-40 down and take the game - and, effectively, stay alive in the tournament. Muchova wins a game point, but a fine, deep return from Stephens forces an error and we’re back to deuce. Muchova forces it back to deuce after a long rally! Very, very impressive. Neither player held back there, despite the importance of the point. Stephens eventually sends a forehand wide and Muchova has parity. Now, two break points for Stephens after a couple of errors from Muchova. Muchova saves the first and it’s 30-40. Huge point coming up, can Stephens break again? Krejcikova and Svitolina are level at 3-3 in their first set, both with a break. Now Muchova, showing plenty of fight, forces a break point and she gets it! She’s broken back for 4-4 in the second set, and Stephens has more work to do. Now a break point for Stephens against Muchova! Muchova can’t afford to lose this point. But she does, directing a backhand into the net. Stephens is well set now, a break up once again, 4-3 in the second set, already a set to the good. Schwartzman is two sets up now against Kohlschreiber: 6-4, 6-2. Musetti, meanwhile, has hit back to level at 1-1 in sets against Cecchinato: 6-3, 4-6. If you missed it, here is a news story from yesterday regarding the arrest of the Russian player, Yana Sizikova, over allegations of spot-fixing in last year’s French Open: It’s 3-3! Stephens holds serve to draw level in the second set. Muchova has tightened up her game and is making life much tougher for Stephens now. The American puts a backhand into the net for deuce in the sixth game of the second set. Following a washout at Lord’s yesterday, it’s game on in St John’s Wood this morning in the first England v New Zealand Test match. Tim de Lisle is covering the action here: It’s been extremely high-quality tennis here, so much so, it’s a big surprise when Muchova tamely finds the net with a backhand from the baseline. That makes it 30-30 and it’s a chance for Stephens: but now the American puts a shot of her own into the net from the back of the court for 40-30 to Muchova. Muchova closes out the game and it’s 3-2 to the Czech in the second set. Muchova now advances to the net and produced a lovely angled drop, then smacks a backhanded winner for 30-0. She’s on top right now. Stephens answers back, dispatching a fine backhand winner on a short ball. She’s done it! Stephens chases down a drop shot, opening up the right of the court, and Muchova passes to break back! Great point, and a great game. It’s 2-2 in the second set and Muchova is back in it! Muchova is noticeably timing the ball a lot better in the last few games, really starting to get a feel for it. Muchova gets it wrong again. She’s had four break points so far in this match and converted none of them. Now, here’s a fifth ... can she do it? Now, a chance for Muchova to break back ... she gains advantage on Stephens’ serve, but then inexplicably sends a forehand well wide. But next up, Muchova digs out a stunning volley at the net for another break point! On Court Philippe-Chatrier, the fifth seed Svitolina has started her match against Krejcikova. Schwartzman leads Kohlschreiber 3-1 in their second set (the Argentinian also won the first set, 6-4), while Musetti is 4-3 up on Cecchinato in that second set. A perfectly-judged drop shot from Muchova and she’s on the board in the second set, at 2-1 to Stephens. Stephens has fallen down the rankings of late - according to the commentators, in fact, she won just four matches throughout the whole of 2020 - but this performance has been well above her current ranking of 59 in the world. Muchova hasn’t played badly but Stephens has exerted control with every area of her game. Stephens holds comfortably for 2-0 in the second set. Muchova is very much second best here. Muchova has won just one out of 11 points when she’s come to the net, so she probably needs to rethink that tactic. Muchova sends a forehand long, after another entertaining rally, to seal a Stephens break at the start of the first set! Trouble for Muchova. Schwartzman wins the first set against Kohlschreiber, 6-4. Stephens wins the first set, 6-3! This has been a really interesting and engaging contest: Muchova has been mixing things up with a few clever drop shots, but Stephens has generally been in the ascendancy, taking every advantage with her accomplished forehand and showing ability to dictate the terms of many of the rallies from the baseline. Muchova moves to 40-0 on her serve, including a drop shot that flicks off the net cord (Muchova raising a hand by way of apology), and a lob which Stephens decided not to play but drops just inside the tramlines. Muchova then seals a love hold with another drop shot - and the American Stephens will serve for the first set at 5-3. Schwartzman is really making Kohlschreiber work to hold serve in that first set, but the German finally does it, and it’s 5-4 to the Argentinian who will try to serve it out now. Cecchinato wins his first set against Musetti, 6-3. The Stephens forehand is causing Muchova plenty of issues. The American earns a second advantage - and wins the game when the Czech sends a volley long. The umpire gets out of his seat and jogs to the back of the court to check the mark, raises his finger in confirmation, and it’s 5-2 to Stephens in this very engaging first set. Muchova takes it deuce on Stephens’ serve. Muchova then wins a break point with a fine, powerful forehand into the corner on her opponent’s backhand side. But Stephens then saves the break point with a big forehand of her own which Muchova can only dump in the net. On court, Stephens and Muchova both hold serve, and it’s 4-2 in the first set. Kohlschreiber is serving to stay in the first set against Schwartman at 3-5. Sloane Stephens has had a terribly tough year, having lost two grandparents and an aunt to Covid-19, and has said that she wishes she had attended her grandparents’ funeral instead of being in isolation ahead of the Australian Open: “I should have asked to go to my grandparents’ funeral,” she told the New York Times earlier this week. “I should have made those inquiries and seen if I could get out of the bubble and go home. I didn’t. It’s something that I’ll probably regret for the rest of my life, because I prioritized my tennis over things that were happening in my life. The only thing I can do now is move on and move forward. There’s nothing wrong with having a therapist or two and a grief counselor and all of these things. I have to do what’s best for me and work on myself.” Schwartzman has broken Kohlschreiber, to go 4-2 up, and now Stephens breaks Muchova for 3-1 in the first set! Elsewhere in the men’s singles, Marco Cecchinato is 4-2 up on Lorenzo Musetti on Court 7. Stephens wins a break point with a lovely sliced backhand down the line. Muchova saves it with a delicate (and brave) drop shot - a much better effort than her previous one. Stephens is seeing it - and hitting it - remarkably well. She wrests control of a rally with a booming backhand, crosscourt, and finishes off the point in style. She is dictating the terms more often than not. Schwartzman and Kohlschreiber are under way on Suzanne Lenglen and it’s 2-2 in the first set. Stephens wins four points in a row to hold her second service game, and it’s 2-1 in the American’s favour against Muchova. Muchova finally manages to hold: she had to work for that, and this is shaping up to be a closely-fought - and very entertaining - affair. 1-1. Muchova tries a drop shot for the first time but Stephens runs it down easily and puts away a forehand winner. Back to deuce. Muchova is now having to work to hold her first service game. Stephens takes it to deuce after a marathon rally, both players hitting wonderfully well early in this match. Muchova grabs advantage, but Stephens stays aliver with an excellent forehand on to Muchova’s toes as the Czech comes forward, and she can only direct it into the net. Sloane Stephens holds serve against Karolina Muchova to begin their third-round match. It was an interesting first game, with both players hitting the ball sweetly and powerfully. Muchova produced one brilliant clean backhanded winner on Stephens’ second serve, but Stephens generally had the best of the rallies and she is on the board in solid style. Here is Tumaini Carayol’s report from yesterday, including Serena Williams’ win against Danielle Collins, as well as Aryna Sabalenka’s defeat by Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova: Sloane Stephens v Karolina Muchova (seeded 18) is first up on Court Simonne Mathieu, a match I will focus on to begin with. I’ll bring you live scores from across the other courts, of course. If you have any thoughts on the day’s action, you can drop me an email or tweet @LukeMcLaughlin. As the days tick by at Roland Garros and the field thins out, the big guns are naturally becoming more noticeable in the order of play: the men’s singles today sees Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal take to the clay for their third-round matches. Nadal, the 13-times French Open champion, will go into battle later today against Cameron Norrie, the British No 2, while Djokovic takes on Ricardas Berankis of Lithuania and Federer meets the left-handed German Dominik Koepfer. British fans will be fascinated to see how Norrie gets on: he was impressively consistent in his second-round win against Lloyd Harris, but will he have the weapons to trouble the king of clay? We will find out from around 1.15pm. In the women’s competition, a few big names have admittedly fallen early: Naomi Osaka withdrew, sparking a global debate about mental health and media coverage which rumbles on, while Ash Barty, the world No 1, was forced to retire from the tournament with a hip injury. The reigning champion Iga Swiatek of Poland is still very much in contention, however, in ominous form, and is clearly feeling increasingly confident about a second title. Swiatek faces a potentially tricky tie against 30th seed Estonian Anett Kontaveit this afternoon, scheduled on court at 3pm. Barbora Krejcikova will be the opposition for Elina Svitolina (5) on Philippe-Chatrier from 11am, while the fourth seed Sofia Kenin meets her American compatriot Jessica Pegula on Court Suzanne Lenglen. Coco Gauff v Jennifer Brady is another all-American affair from 3.15pm. There is light cloud covering Paris at the moment but no rain is expected, and the sun is scheduled to peep through the clouds later in the day.

It might not have the same ring as “Dreamtime at the ‘G” but given the era of Covid that we live in, we should be grateful it is happening at all. And why not share the love? Optus Stadium will no doubt do the game justice, with ticket sales going gangbusters and the venue record for an AFL game – 59,608, for the 2018 preliminary final between West Coast and Melbourne – under serious threat.</p> <p>The pin-up match of Sir Doug Nicholls Round should be quite a contest, too, with both Richmond and Essendon in winning form and sniffing around the lower reaches of the top eight. A win for either team tonight will do their finals chances the world of good. For their part, the Bombers will be delighted to return to the stadium where last week they toppled West Coast.

Grimes gets dispossessed deep in defence - how was that not holding the ball?????? - and Essendon are denied what should be theirs: a shot on goal. The ball slings to the other end and Castagna, somehow afforded time and space close to goal, finishes off in a cruel blow to the Bombers. Twelve-point play. Don’t want to bash the umps, but that was awful umpiring. Q3: 9 mins remaining: Essendon 6-6 (42) vs Richmond 9-8 (62) Richmond goal! The Bombers aren’t clean out of defence and they turn the ball over just where they don’t want to: in the path of Bolton, who reads the ball off the pack and splits the big sticks from close range. That stings for Essendon. Q3: 11 mins remaining: Essendon 6-5 (41) vs Richmond 8-8 (56) Cotchin coughs up possession with a poor kick inside before Zaharakis takes over and sets up Phillips but he squanders his chance to get the Bombers within two kicks of the Tigers, missing to the left what he really should have kicked. Q3: 14 mins remaining: Essendon 6-4 (40) vs Richmond 8-8 (56) Essendon goal! Lightning fast work from Mc-T in the middle of the ground opens up Richmond’s zone and Zaharakis is involved to set up Ham, who drills his shot on the run to put Essendon right in this contest. Q3: 16 mins remaining: Essendon 5-4 (34) vs Richmond 8-8 (56) Dusty almost pouches an extremely tough half-chance deep in attack but the ball spills free and Essendon collect the crumbs to work their way out of danger. Q3: 19 mins remaining: Essendon 5-4 (34) vs Richmond 8-8 (56) And we are back. Richmond clear away from the centre and Laverde, under heavy pressure from Martin, punches the ball through for a rushed behind. Richmond maintain their ascendancy but Essendon’s commitment was better in that second term. Though the Tigers extended their 19-point quarter-time lead to 21 at the main break, the Bombers look to be more in the contest than they were in the opening stanza. They started getting their hands on it in the middle of the park and were far more direct in their forward advances. It’s still Richmond’s to lose but Essendon are not out of this by any stretch. Q2: 1 min remaining: Essendon 5-4 (34) vs Richmond 8-7 (55) Essendon goal! The Bombers pressure Richmond into a turnover and Ham makes another good fist of it, getting on the end of a handpass receive and kicking truly on the run. They won’t go away, the Dons. Q2: 2 mins remaining: Essendon 4-3 (27) vs Richmond 8-7 (55) Coleman-Jones is awarded a holding free but can’t make the Dons pay, missing his chance to kick three goals inside the first half. Q2: 4 mins remaining: Essendon 4-3 (27) vs Richmond 8-6 (54) Richmond goal! Waterman spills what he should have taken and Richmond cash in as Graham converts from close range. The closer the Bombers get, the further away the Tigers go. Q2: 6 mins remaining: Essendon 4-3 (27) vs Richmond 7-6 (48) Essendon goal! And now a quick reply from the Bombers after a centre victory of their own, Waterman doing the rest with a deft finish. Q2: 7 mins remaining: Essendon 3-3 (21) vs Richmond 7-6 (48) Richmond goal! Quick reply from the Tigers and it again comes from a centre clearance. Bombers defenders can’t do anything to mop up as Caddy spins, dodges and shakes - confusing everybody, including possibly himself - before snapping a goal with his left boot. Q2: 9 mins remaining: Essendon 3-3 (21) vs Richmond 6-6 (42) Essendon goal! Riewoldt coughs up a 50-metre penalty in Richmond’s back half and it’s a costly error as Phillips, who outmuscles Pickett in a marking contest before converting nicely. They needed that, the Bombers. Q2: 10 mins remaining: Essendon 2-3 (15) vs Richmond 6-5 (41) Richmond goal! Another for Riewoldt and six for Richmond and Jumping Jack rocks back from about 50 out and bisects the middle. Huge tackle from Aarts, and repeat involvement from Houli, set it all up. Q2: 12 mins remaining: Essendon 2-3 (15) vs Richmond 5-5 (35) McGrath looks done for the night with a knee injury. Big blow for the Bombers. Cox takes a well-judged mark, cops one late from Vlastuin for his troubles, but can’t finish the job as his set shot misses to the left. At the other end, and boy did the ball move fast, Riewoldt hits the post with a left-foot snap. Q2: 16 mins remaining: Essendon 2-2 (14) vs Richmond 5-4 (34) Richmond goal! Fast break by the Tigers and a searching ball to a dangerous spot is gobbled up by Coleman-Jones, who seals the deal with an assured finish. Q2: 17 mins remaining: Essendon 2-2 (14) vs Richmond 4-4 (28) Essendon goal! The Bombers rebound and they catch the Tiges unawares with some swift ball movement as Hooker fairly well outmarks three defenders before splitting the big sticks in a much-needed goal. There are already 55,000 people in the stadium. Biggest crowd of the year at Optus. Q2: 19 mins remaining: Essendon 1-2 (8) vs Richmond 4-4 (28) Michael Long just got interviewed on the telly. We are not worthy. The Tigers look set to start with another goal but a timely touch on the line makes it only a sixth as bad. All Richmond, really. The Tigers dominated possession in the first quarter and that led to a glut of inside-50s. The weight of numbers told in the end and Essendon have some work to do. Q1: 1 min remaining: Essendon 1-2 (8) vs Richmond 4-3 (27) Richmond goal! Mc-T has a bit of a fumble in the middle of the ground, but Chol then matches him, and the quarter looks to be petering out before a chaos ball inside 50 hits the chest of Riewoldt, who rocks back and converts. Big first quarter from Richmond. Q1: 2 mins remaining: Essendon 1-2 (8) vs Richmond 3-3 (21) Laverde’s rushed kick forward is snaffled by Chol, who is having one heck of a quarter - maybe he is a first-choice ruckman - but his disposal lets him down and Essendon have a chance to reboot. Lovely looking set shot from Parish almost on the boundary but it fades to the right. Q1: 5 mins remaining: Essendon 1-1 (7) vs Richmond 3-3 (21) Richmond goal! The Tigers are cutting Essendon to shreds in the middle - far too easy in the corridor - and Castagna slots one home after marking, unmarked if you don’t mind, 35 metres out from goal directly in front. Q1: 8 mins remaining: Essendon 1-1 (7) vs Richmond 2-2 (14) Essendon goal! The Bombers are away as Ham gets a slice of the action, marking strongly inside 50 and Ham-mering it home with an assured kick from (free) range. Just as well he didn’t shave the post and instead put it through the middle. Q1: 10 mins remaining: Essendon 0-1 (1) vs Richmond 2-2 (14) The Bombers get the ball not only inside 50 but onto the chest of a leading forward. Jones has a good chance to kickstart his team’s night but it’s a horrible shank that still manages to register a behind. By the by, Martin has changed his boots. Bigger moulds? Q1: 12 mins remaining: Essendon 0-0 (0) vs Richmond 2-2 (14) Richmond goal! Chol finds himself with time and space at centre half-forward - he’s off to a blinder - and a pinpoint pass finds Martin, who does what Martin does. The rest. Big start by the Tiges. Q1: 14 mins remaining: Essendon 0-0 (0) vs Richmond 1-2 (8) Ripping tackle by Redman on Aarts saves Essendon’s bacon in the right forward pocket. The Dons might want to start possessing the ball, however! Q1: 15 mins remaining: Essendon 0-0 (0) vs Richmond 1-2 (8) Richmond Goal! Coleman-Jones gets manhandled in the square and it’s an easy conversion from there. First goal of the game. All Richmond so far. Killing it in the middle and Essendon can’t get their hands on it. Q1: 17 mins remaining: Essendon 0-0 (0) vs Richmond 0-2 (2) Dusty gets his hands on it in the centre and he finds Riewoldt on the chest - how many times have we seen that?! - but the entry inside-50 is a bit off and it’s anyone’s ball before Prestia has a rushed snap that misses to the left. Q1: 19 mins remaining: Essendon 0-0 (0) vs Richmond 0-1 (1) And we are away. Straight out of the middle by Richmond and Chol goes long. Could’ve been a goal in about as many seconds but he misses to the right. TWELVE snags!!!!!!!!! The Crows have been fined a hefty amount - hefty in the sense that it will come from their football department soft cap - for what can only be described as an act of rank stupidity. 100% The Dons haven’t beaten Richmond since round 11, 2014. If you don’t think that was a long time ago, take a look at how young some of these gents look. In a game with fewer players. So an enormous ratio! It’s a sensational day in Perth. Prime conditions for a long walk and a great game of footy. The annual Dreamtime fixture really is a beaut. It’s something lovers of this great game should cherish.

Three double-barreled surnames. How refreshing! Good evening and welcome to Dreamtime in the west. It might not have the same ring as “Dreamtime at the ‘G” but given the era of Covid that we live in, we should be grateful it is happening at all. And why not share the love? Optus Stadium will no doubt do the game justice, with ticket sales going gangbusters and the venue record for an AFL game – 59,608, for the 2018 preliminary final between West Coast and Melbourne – under serious threat. The pin-up match of Sir Doug Nicholls Round should be quite a contest, too, with both Richmond and Essendon in winning form and sniffing around the lower reaches of the top eight. A win for either team tonight will do their finals chances the world of good. For their part, the Bombers will be delighted to return to the stadium where last week they toppled West Coast. They will need to draw on the good vibes generated by that upset victory if they are to avoid an 11th successive defeat at the hands of the Tigers.

Burns has only five from his last 30 balls, so the question now is whether he can take charge.</p> <p>“Just done a team sprint triathlon in Leeds (I know I know, anything to get out of the house),” says Guy Hornsby. “Checked my phone after the finish to a flurry of notifications.

And he nearly gets a golden duck, just saving himself from a big LBW shout by getting an inside edge. Robinson can bat, but he hasn’t shown it yet – he gets off the mark with a leaden-footed squirt through the slips.

They need another 29 to see off the possibility of the follow-on. Here’s Richard O’Hagan again. “I know that there’s a lot of 90s nostalgia around at the moment – music reviews, Euro 96 reviews and so on – but England being thrashed by NZ was one memory I really didn’t want to revisit.” 59th over: England 147-6 (Burns 67, Robinson 5) Robinson plays his first decent shot, a firm push down the ground off Southee, which is saved by a diving stop from Kane Williamson. If he’d thought about it, Williamson might have let it trickle for four, to give Southee a few more goes at Robinson. Southee could afford to concede the extra run: his spell now stands at 11-6-18-3, and it may have won the match. 58th over: England 143-6 (Burns 66, Robinson 2) Burns needs to get a move on, but de Grandhomme isn’t the bowler you’d choose for that scenario. He keeps it tight apart from a big fat no-ball. Burns has only five from his last 30 balls, so the question now is whether he can take charge. “Just done a team sprint triathlon in Leeds (I know I know, anything to get out of the house),” says Guy Hornsby. “Checked my phone after the finish to a flurry of notifications. I thought ‘it can’t be the cricket’ but... Of COURSE IT CAN. I know we’re keen on a result but.... Oh England.” 57th over: England 142-6 (Burns 66, Robinson 2) One debutant gives way to another as Ollie Robinson comes in. His first Test has been a right old rollercoaster – four wickets and one disgrace, albeit from years ago. And he nearly gets a golden duck, just saving himself from a big LBW shout by getting an inside edge. Robinson can bat, but he hasn’t shown it yet – he gets off the mark with a leaden-footed squirt through the slips. This is riveting. Another duck! Poor Bracey’s first Test innings comes to a miserable end as Southee bends one back up the slope and the bat goes some way down the wrong line. England have lost three for none in 21 balls. It’s a classic English collapse, and they still need 39 to avoid the follow-on. 56th over: England 140-5 (Burns 66, Bracey 0) Time for a bowling change, as Jamieson takes a breather and Colin de Mullet comes on. It’s a maiden from him to Burns, and that’s drinks, with New Zealand well on top. England’s grown-ups have been fine, making 108 runs for once out, while the kids are all wrong – Sibley 0, Crawley 2, Pope 22, Lawrence 0. These ducks and twos won’t do: if you’re going to struggle, at least stick around for half an hour. “You see,” says Richard O’Hagan, “this is why England picked a top-order batter at number 7. It all makes sense now.” 55th over: England 140-5 (Burns 66, Bracey 0) And here comes James Bracey, on debut. Facing the demon Southee, he leaves one that’s a little too close for comfort, then traps a full ball in the crease like a footballer. But he’s survived five balls, which is three more than Lawrence managed. Southee’s spell now: 9-6-11-2, Timmy with a strong whiff of Jimmy. Another one! Southee sends down a piece of sheer temptation, in the form of a full outswinger. And Lawrence takes the bait, giving Colin de Grandhomme, at third slip, a catch so simple that he could have held it in his mullet. 54th over: England 140-4 (Burns 66, Lawrence 0) Dan Lawrence has come in, but has only faced one ball so far. He is England’s sixth specialist batsman, something that hardly ever happened under Ed Smith – who is having rather a good game, as absent friends often do. 53rd over: England 140-4 (Burns 66, Lawrence 0) Great stuff from Southee, whose spell has been impeccable: 8-5-11-1. “I wonder,” says David Reynolds, “if any of your readers might know what ails the overseas TMS feed. To begin with, the Youtube page for Day 4 produced no sound, and now the link for it has disappeared from the BBC Cricket page. In the meantime, this Middlesex man is hoping for oodles of Surrey runs today.” Yes, he’s gone! It was a very plumb plumb, and Southee knew it. Gough is not God after all. And Pope’s promising innings turns out to be a mere cameo. The only reason to think this is not out is that Michael Gough said so, and he is hardly ever wrong. 52nd over: England 140-3 (Burns 66, Pope 22) A glance from Pope, so he gets down the other end, the better to decide who it is that Jamieson really resembles. And finally we have a commanding shot from Burns, clipping for four in front of square. He could do with a hundred here after six consecutive Tests of diddly squat. 51st over: England 135-3 (Burns 62, Pope 21) After that flurry of runs, Southee decides a maiden is required, and Burns obliges. “Jamieson just offered up one cheeky grin too many,” says Robert Cookson, “and I realised that he has more than a passing resemblance to a youthful Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson. I’m done for the day.” Kyle Jamieson thus becomes the first person ever to be likened to both B Johnson and R Redford in the same morning. 50th over: England 135-3 (Burns 62, Pope 21) Burns takes a single off Jamieson, and Pope clips a blameless ball square for four. Isa Guha heard him taking guard and asking for middle-and-off, which enables a shot like that – but if he misses, playing a ball on middle stump with half a bat, he’ll be plumb. Intriguing stuff. 49th over: England 130-3 (Burns 61, Pope 17) Pope, freed from the shackles of Jamieson, spots a half-volley from Southee and creams it to the extra-cover boundary. That’s the shot of the morning, not that the bar is a high one. And then it’s trumped by an on-drive off a pretty good ball, swinging out from middle-and-leg. Pope is moving the game along at a good lick, which is just what it needs. “Jamieson has something of the Tremlett about him, don’t you think?” says Kevin Wilson. “Not super quick, about Anderson or Broad pace, but he just looks huge! A lovely, flowing action too. Broad is the same height more or less but wouldn’t intimidate me half as much as Jamieson would.” Broad, right now, only intimidates coaches and people called Warner. But with a bit of luck he’ll see himself being written off and get 6 for 20 in the second innings. 48th over: England 122-3 (Burns 61, Pope 9) Another four to Pope, another thick edge off Jamieson, but with a bit more control this time. Then we get the first single of the day, as Pope nudges to fine leg. Burns, facing Jamieson for the first time, is turned around and slammed on the back pad. There’s a big appeal but the ump reckons it’s too high. Ooh – umpire’s call. On this evidence Jamieson is much like Ollie Robinson, but even more effective, because taller and that bit more experienced. 47th over: England 117-3 (Burns 61, Pope 4) With the ball moving sideways, Rory Burns – who does plenty of that himself – looks like a wicket waiting to happen. But he’s a fighter and he gets off the mark for the morning with a shovel for two off Southee. 46th over: England 115-3 (Burns 59, Pope 4) We have some runs! Four of them, to Ollie Pope, but off a thick edge – a bit of a grope from Pope. And next ball he plays and misses. How many do England need to avoid the follow-on? Another 60 or so. 45th over: England 111-3 (Burns 59, Pope 0) At the other end – running in from the Pavilion – it’s Tim Southee, and he too is swinging it round corners.

Tim Alderslade, the chief executive of the industry body that represents UK carriers, said ministers had not kept to promises over a “green watchlist” that would have given travellers increased warning about a country potentially coming off the safe list. His comments came after the government decided to move Portugal from the green list and into the amber travel category. It means people arriving in the UK from Portugal after 4am on Tuesday will need to self-isolate at home for 10 days in a change that has left holidaymakers scrambling for pricey return flights in a bid to beat the quarantine deadline. Speaking about the “green watchlist” proposal, Alderslade BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: It would be a list of countries that were on the cusp or there was a risk that they would be moving from green to amber so passengers were aware of that, it was fully transparent and they would be taking that risk when they booked. It was entirely to stop what happened last summer when countries were moving up and down off the corridor list on a weekly basis and we saw people stranded overseas and then desperate to come home again because they couldn’t afford to quarantine. It has caused complete pandemonium because we don’t have that watchlist that we were promised by the government and I think with the taskforce, the transparency is not there, we don’t know what has to happen for countries to move from green to amber, or amber to green for that matter. Everyone aged older than 12 years in specific postcode areas of the English county of Berkshire will be offered PCR testing over the next two weeks from Monday in an effort to tackle the spread of the Delta variant. Meradin Peachey, the director of public health for Berkshire West, said a “real concern” with this variant is that if it keeps circulating there may be more mutations. She told BBC Breakfast: What’s happened in the last couple of weeks, especially in the last week, we’ve noticed that a lot of cases now coming through we can’t link to any travellers, which means we now have community transmission. She said cases are mainly among young people, with “virtually nobody over 60 or anyone who has been vaccinated” affected. She added: If the variant spreads and becomes even more, it may mutate again and the big concern is that vaccines won’t work. We really want to get people tested and isolated if they’ve got the virus, stop the spread so that we can make sure the vaccination programme works. Earlier, Dr Mike Tildesley, a member of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (Spi-M) UK government advisory panel, said ministers had a “difficult call” to make. He told Times Radio: It’s a hard one. I’m going to be annoying and sit a little bit on the fence on this, as I don’t think it’s our role as epidemiologists to call that. I think the difficult thing that we have, the difficult situation the government have, is of course if you delay that then of course you’ll get a smaller subsequent wave. I mean, that’s the case with any control policy – if you leave them in for a longer period of time then it’s going to reduce cases. But, of course, if you delay that we know that negatively impacts businesses, people’s livelihoods, and so forth. So, this is the difficult call that they have to make, and all we can do is put together as much evidence as possible and say this is what we expect to happen if you relax on 21 June, this is what we may expect if you delay that by two weeks for example, or four weeks and so on, so they have all the evidence they can to make the decision. It is clear that it would be “foolish” and a “major risk” to go ahead with the 21 June reopening, an expert on an advisory group to the UK government has said. Prof Stephen Reicher said there was enough evidence to say one of the government’s four key tests for its roadmap out of lockdown had not been met, according to the PA news agency. The member of the Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours (Spi-B), which advises the government, said the criteria about the current assessment of the risks not being fundamentally changed by new variants of concern was “not upheld” due to the spread of the Delta variant. Reicher told the news agency: I think, by the government’s own criteria, it’s quite clear that it would be foolish to proceed on the data that we’ve got at the moment. The risk would be very great indeed. And of course it’s a balance of risks but I think it would be a major risk to go further in opening up. Again, I make the point that it is about data not dates, and if you make it too much about the dates then you box yourself into a corner and I think that’s what the government has done. Marton Aszalos, a Hungarian paramedic, and Eniko Tokacs-Mathe, a vet, had to cancel their wedding twice during the pandemic and are finally getting ready for their big day this summer as restrictions are lifted. Reuters reports that the couple, who met in 2016 at a clinic where Eniko was working and Marton was then a trainee, say the emotional rollercoaster of the past 18 months has been draining but has made their relationship stronger. Eniko told the news agency: Because of the pandemic, we had to replan our wedding for the third time; both its date and the venue. The pandemic has also had a serious mental and physical affect on my fiancé as he is an ambulance officer. Reuters reports that the couple held a civil ceremony a month ago and are preparing for a wedding party with more than 100 guests in the town of Makó, near the Romanian border. Eniko is from Transylvania and many of her relatives will cross to Hungary to attend. They have been rehearsing their waltz for the wedding night, after a photo shoot on a motor boat on the Danube. Eniko said: Before, I thought my main worries would be whether we manage the lift in the dance, whether my makeup and hair would look good. But now, I am just happy and hope that all the guests and relatives can make it in health and we can celebrate together. Many couples are relieved that with 53% of Hungarians vaccinated, they can now go ahead and get married, Reuters reports. Gabor Herendi, a wedding planner, usually handles 30 to 35 weddings a year. But, in 2020, about 70% were postponed to this year. After the long wait, “energies will be multiplied”, he said. Hawaii will drop its quarantine and testing requirements for travellers once 70% of the state’s population has been vaccinated, the Associated Press reports, citing the governor, David Ige. The state will also lift its requirement that people wear masks indoors once that level has been reached. The state health department website said 59% of Hawaii’s population had had at least one dose of a vaccine and 52% had finished their dosing regimen. The AP reports: The state is using its figures, and not those provided by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to calculate thresholds for lifting restrictions. The health department director, Dr Libby Char, said that’s because Hawaii’s numbers are more accurate. She said it appeared the CDC had been counting some of Hawaii’s doses twice. Right now, travellers arriving from out of state must spend 10 days in quarantine or, to bypass that quarantine, they must show proof of a negative test taken before departure for the islands. Once 60% of Hawaii’s population is vaccinated, Ige said, the state will allow travellers to bypass a quarantine requirement as long as they can prove they were vaccinated in the US. Restrictions on travel between the islands will open up before that. Ige said that as of 15 June, people will be able to fly inter-island without taking a test or showing proof of vaccination. Also on that date, those who have been vaccinated in Hawaii may bypass quarantine when returning from a trip out of state. Russia has reported 9,145 new cases, including 2,897 in Moscow, taking the official national tally since the pandemic began to 5,117,274. According to Reuters, the government’s taskforce said 399 people had died in the past 24 hours, pushing the national death toll to 123,436. Taiwan has reported 511 new domestic cases, including 35 cases added to totals for recent days. That is up from the 472 domestic infections reported on Friday, Reuters reports. The agency also reports that Taiwan is in talks with US companies about making their vaccines, following similar talks with European firms, citing the health minister Chen Shih-chung. Taiwan, like much of the world, has been trying to speed up its vaccination programme following a spike in domestic cases, but has been stymied by global supply shortages. Chen told reporters that they previously had talks with European companies he did not name about producing their vaccines under licence. “Only recently have we started to have talks with US companies to see if it’s possible or not to carry out relevant subcontracting work,” he added, without providing details. Taiwan has ordered around 5m shots from the US firm Moderna, of which 150,000 have arrived. It has ordered 10m shots from the British-Swedish firm AstraZeneca. Taiwan, also in talks with BioNTech, blames China – which claims the island as its own territory – for blocking a deal with the German company earlier this year. Johnson &amp; Johnson said on Friday it had been in talks with Taiwan about providing its vaccine since last year. The number of confirmed cases in Germany increased by 2,294 to 3,697,927, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) shows, while the reported death toll has risen by 122 to 89,148. Mexico recorded 206 more deaths on Friday, bringing the total death toll to 228,568, its health ministry has said. Separate government data recently published suggests the real death toll may be at least 60% above the confirmed figure, Reuters has reported. Victoria, Australia’s second most populous state, has reported a small increase in locally acquired cases, as authorities hunt for the source of a new cluster of a highly infectious variant. Reuters reports: Five new local cases were reported, taking Victoria’s total to 70 in the latest outbreak, as the state capital, Melbourne, entered its second weekend of a hard lockdown, due to end on 10 June. Curbs were eased for the rest of the state on Friday. Saturday’s count was up from four new locally acquired cases on Friday. Authorities were alarmed after detecting the highly infectious Delta variant for the first time in Melbourne, sparking concerns cases could surge. There are now seven known cases in the city. The Delta variant, which has been classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as among the four variants of concern due to evidence that it spreads more easily, probably caused the latest devastating outbreak in India. Snap lockdowns, regional border restrictions and strict social distancing rules have helped Australia rein in prior outbreaks and keep its numbers relatively low at just 30,150 cases and 910 deaths. Victoria’s outbreak, which began on 24 May, has spurred people to join long queues for vaccinations following a slow rollout since February. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, said 20% of the adult population had now had a first dose of a vaccine. India’s capital city is preparing to deal with an infection peak of 37,000 cases a day in future, its chief minister has said, as the country as a whole reports 120,529 new cases over the last 24 hours. According to the Reuters agency, New Delhi’s political leader Arvind Kejriwal announced a partial easing of a lockdown, while the city is also preparing for oxygen storage capacity of 420 tons, and will set up genome sequencing labs to study coronavirus variants. Citing the federal health ministry, the agency reported 3,380 more deaths across India in 24 hours and said the tally of infections stood at 28.69 million and the death toll at 344,082.","charCount":"12007","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/kevin-rawlinson\">Kevin Rawlinson</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2021/jun/05/yorkshire-v-sussex-glamorgan-v-lancs-and-more-county-cricket-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-05T11:15:19Z","webTitle":"Yorkshire v Sussex, Glamorgan beat Lancs and more: county cricket – live!","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2021/jun/05/yorkshire-v-sussex-glamorgan-v-lancs-and-more-county-cricket-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2021/jun/05/yorkshire-v-sussex-glamorgan-v-lancs-and-more-county-cricket-live","fields":{"headline":"Yorkshire v Sussex, Glamorgan beat Lancs and more: county cricket – live!","standfirst":"<ul><li>County Championship updates from around the grounds</li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2021/jun/05/england-v-new-zealand-first-test-day-four-live\">England v New Zealand – live!

The only remaining unbeaten record in county cricket has disappeared. And the result was flashed up on the scoreboard here at Headingley, where cheers and claps rung out. Yorkshire 340-3 in the 92nd over, with Dawid Malan on 123 not out. Labuschagne, by the way, finished 63 not out. Derbyshire are chasing 309 to beat Warwickshire at the County Ground and thus claim their first win of the season at the eighth attempt. They have bowled the visitors out for 155 second time around this morning, with South African seamer Michael Cohen claiming five wickets. Glamorgan need eight to win with six wickets left. Be some collapse to blow it from there! Crikey, must be soggy at Canterbury. Further inspection at 12pm. Glamorgan nearly there – 168-4, needing 20 more. Marnus Labuschagne’s 46 not out represents a season’s best. Nothing for Joe Root and co to worry about this winter, hey! Gloucestershire 23-3 in their second innings at Grace Road, still trailing Leicestershire by 270. And Hampshire are 311 all out at Taunton, trailing by 49. Josh Davey finished with five-for. Plenty of wickets around the traps. Lewis McManus missed out on a hundred at Taunton, where Hampshire are 307-9 in their first innings, trailing by 53. In the Rachael Heyhoe Flint Trophy, Katherine Brunt has struck three times for the Northern Diamonds at Fenner’s. Sunrisers are 16-5. Early wicket at Cardiff. Luke Wood has just got Kiran Carlson caught behind. Glamorgan 153-4, needing 35. There’s also been a wicket at Headingley. Gary Ballance caught behind off the impressive off-spin of Jack Carson for 77. 280-3 in the 79th over. There will be a delayed start at Canterbury due to damp conditions following yesterday’s torrential rain. Thankfully, play is up and running everywhere else, including at Lord’s, where England have lost Joe Root early – 111-3. Initial eyes are focused towards Cardiff. Glamorgan 143-3, needing 45 more. Labuschagne there on 36. His highest score of the season so far is 44. Jonny Bairstow is at Headingley this morning. He has netted and done some running with Yorkshire’s strength and conditioning coach, Pete Sim. Bairstow is due to make a handful of appearances for Yorkshire in the Vitality Blast, which gets under way for them here on Thursday against Birmingham Bears. That game, if selected, will also be Tim Bresnan’s first appearance against Yorkshire since leaving them last summer. It’s shorts weather for the second day running at Headingley, a far cry from the snow which greeted us eight weeks ago today when Yorkshire faced Glamorgan in the season opener. I think I wore three jumpers that day and two coats – sat inside! Tanya, I seem to remember, even went out at lunch and took orders for hot water bottles from the local B&amp;M Bargains or Poundland. Anyway, I apologise for the early digression. Here, yesterday, was a day to long remember as Sussex’s debutant Dan Ibrahim became the youngest player to score a fifty in Championship history, aged 16 and 299 days. He looked the real deal in front of a near-2,000 crowd. His composure really stood out before he struck with his medium pacers as Yorkshire slipped to 95-2 in reply to 313. Unfortunately, things got much harder for the young buck and his mates as Dawid Malan and Gary Ballance shared an unbroken 177 and will resume this morning looking to put a young attack on the ropes from 272-2. Malan (103) brought up a serene century in the final over the day and Ballance has 74. If Yorkshire can complete victory, it is likely to put them back within a handful of points of Group Three leaders Lancashire, who are on course for defeat in a quite remarkable game at Glamorgan. On what Alex Davies has described as a “substandard” pitch, Glamorgan are 137-3 needing 50 more to win with Marnus Labuschagne unbeaten on 32. The only remaining unbeaten record in county cricket this summer looks set to disappear. Mind you, get Marnus out immediately this morning and it could be different.

When play does resume, Northamptonshire will be 362-5 against Kent in the other Group Three fixture and Notts will be 248-6 against Essex in the Group One top-of-the-table clash. Worcestershire have it all to do in Group One at New Road against an emerging Durham; 151 behind with seven wickets remaining and Jake Libby 51 not out. Likewise for Derbyshire at the County Ground against Warwickshire. The Bears, at 132-7 in their second innings, lead by 285. Derby will have to post the highest score of the match to claim victory.

While a final study will be needed, Casimir said the preliminary results mean they can “begin the process of honouring the lost loved ones who are in our caretaking”. “Not acting,” to uncover the rest of those sites, Saganash said, “will be just an invitation to relive the trauma every year or so, as we slowly discover other sites.” Saganash’s family found Jonnish’s grave almost purely by chance, after his sister met a supervisor from the school who remembered him. “When we asked my late mom, after finding her son 40 years later, if she would like the little body to be brought home,” Saganash recalled. “She responded: ‘It is not necessary, because I will be with him one day again.’”","charCount":"7083","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/justin-ling\">Justin Ling</a> in"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2021/jun/05/home-listening-will-liverman-leif-ove-andsnes-mozart-and-1785","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-05T11:00:08Z","webTitle":"Home listening: Will Liverman; Leif Ove Andsnes, Mozart and 1785","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/jun/05/home-listening-will-liverman-leif-ove-andsnes-mozart-and-1785","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2021/jun/05/home-listening-will-liverman-leif-ove-andsnes-mozart-and-1785","fields":{"headline":"Home listening: Will Liverman; Leif Ove Andsnes, Mozart and 1785","standfirst":"<p>The American baritone highlights black composers across generations; and Andsnes and the Mahler Chamber Orchestra play peak Mozart</p>","trailText":"The American baritone highlights black composers across generations; and Andsnes and the Mahler Chamber Orchestra play peak Mozart","byline":"Fiona Maddocks","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"58f29458cfb036e9bce26e2da402367335150fa6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/58f29458cfb036e9bce26e2da402367335150fa6/0_411_4480_2688/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Baritone Will Liverman.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Baritone Will Liverman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jaclyn Simpson</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>• The new album by the baritone <a href=\"http://www.willliverman.com/\">Will Liverman</a>, a recent Papageno at New York’s Metropolitan Opera, and pianist <a href=\"https://www.paultsanchez.com/\">Paul Sánchez</a> should be obligatory listening for anyone planning a song recital, not to mention anyone wanting to expand their musical horizons. <strong><a href=\"https://www.cedillerecords.org/albums/dreams-of-a-new-day-songs-by-black-composers/\">Dreams of a New Day: Songs By Black Composers</a></strong> (Çedille) includes a powerful new commission – <em>Two Black Churches</em> by <a href=\"http://www.shawnokpebholo.com/\">Shawn E Okpebholo</a> (b1981) – alongside existing African American art songs by eight composers past and present.</p> <p>The earliest is Henry Burleigh (1866-1949), who collaborated with Dvořák during the Czech composer’s time in America.

Among women over 50, a third have no private or company pension and are set to rely on the state for their retirement income.</p> <p>These are two of the findings from the insurer SunLife’s <a href=\"https://www.sunlife.co.uk/finances-after-50/\" title=\"\">Finances After 50 report</a>, which is due to be published later this month.</p> <h2><strong>It is not too late to act</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b66b80b7b0f0902a11bd1d641acacc930af4dbe3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b66b80b7b0f0902a11bd1d641acacc930af4dbe3/1258_125_2383_1429/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A financial planning poster\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The coronavirus crisis has put a strain on millions of people’s finances but it is worth weighing up whether you have spare money to put into a pension.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rawpixel Ltd/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The retirement specialist Canada Life recently published research into the UK’s <a href=\"https://www.canadalife.co.uk/unretire/late-financial-bloomers/\" title=\"\">“late financial bloomers”</a> – those who could end up with less money to retire on because of a range of factors that reduce their focus on retirement planning, including marrying later in life and having children later.</p> <p>If you are already struggling with your rent or mortgage, household bills, childcare costs and so on, then putting aside another sum of cash each month may be impossible.</p> <p>But if you can afford to put something by, it is not too late.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You may still have a decade or more of working life, so there is still time to pay into a pension</p> <footer> <cite>Money and Pensions Service's Carolyn Jones</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Ros Altmann, a retirement expert and a former pensions minister, says you are “certainly not” too old to start saving, even if you are in your 50s. “You could save for another 15 or 20 years and benefit from long-term returns, which increases the money you have later in life,” she says.</p> <p>You may still have a decade or more of working life, so there is still time to pay into a pension and top up what you receive as a state pension, says Carolyn Jones, head of pensions policy and strategy at the Money and Pensions Service.</p> <p>“If you’re starting to save later in life, you should consider maximising your pension contributions. It can be hard to find spare money to save but if you get a pay rise or a bonus, or find you can free up some money by spending less somewhere else, think about paying a little more into your pension,” she says.</p> <p>If you start a new job at any point between the age of 22 and the state pension age, your employer will be obliged to put you into a workplace pension scheme where you and they pay some money in. This is known as automatic enrolment. But do not assume this will be enough to provide you with a big payout: the minimum total contribution into the scheme is 8% of your pay, regardless of your age. As an older worker, you will have much less time to pay in and much less time for the fund to grow than if you were in your 20s.</p> <h2>The state pension</h2> <p>If you have made at least 10 years’ worth of national insurance contributions over your adult life, you will be entitled to some level of pension from the state. The maximum state pension for 2021-22 is <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/new-state-pension/what-youll-get\" title=\"\">£179.60 a week</a>, which is £9,339.20 a year. To get that, you will need to have 35 years of contributions.</p> <p>For an estimate of how much state pension you could receive, check your forecast <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/check-state-pension\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p> <p>It is possible to boost your weekly state pension by delaying starting to draw it, Altmann says.</p> <p>Your state pension increases by the equivalent of 1% for every nine weeks you delay – or defer – claiming it, which works out at just under 5.8% for every 52 weeks. So if you are entitled to £179.60 a week, by deferring for 52 weeks you will get an extra £10.42 a week.</p> <p>“However, of course, you are not receiving any state pension until you do start taking it.

It’s £26,000 a year for a couple or £19,000 for a single-person household. That was the headline finding from research this week by Which?, the consumer body, which surveyed almost 7,000 retirees and concluded these were the average annual incomes needed for a comfortable retirement. Which? included state pension income in its calculations (£16,000 a year for the couple and £8,000 a year for the single person is assumed), with the rest presumably having to come from other pensions. But many people are not putting away nearly enough to build up a pension pot that will produce a decent retirement income, and the coronavirus pandemic has exacerbated these problems by putting a huge strain on millions of people’s finances. Building up a decent pot can be particularly challenging for those who, for whatever reason, are late to the pension party, because they have less time to pay in, and their fund has less time to increase in value. Research shared exclusively with Guardian Money found that a quarter of over-50s don’t have a private or company pension. Among women over 50, a third have no private or company pension and are set to rely on the state for their retirement income. These are two of the findings from the insurer SunLife’s Finances After 50 report, which is due to be published later this month. It is not too late to act The retirement specialist Canada Life recently published research into the UK’s “late financial bloomers” – those who could end up with less money to retire on because of a range of factors that reduce their focus on retirement planning, including marrying later in life and having children later. If you are already struggling with your rent or mortgage, household bills, childcare costs and so on, then putting aside another sum of cash each month may be impossible. But if you can afford to put something by, it is not too late. Ros Altmann, a retirement expert and a former pensions minister, says you are “certainly not” too old to start saving, even if you are in your 50s. “You could save for another 15 or 20 years and benefit from long-term returns, which increases the money you have later in life,” she says. You may still have a decade or more of working life, so there is still time to pay into a pension and top up what you receive as a state pension, says Carolyn Jones, head of pensions policy and strategy at the Money and Pensions Service. “If you’re starting to save later in life, you should consider maximising your pension contributions. It can be hard to find spare money to save but if you get a pay rise or a bonus, or find you can free up some money by spending less somewhere else, think about paying a little more into your pension,” she says. If you start a new job at any point between the age of 22 and the state pension age, your employer will be obliged to put you into a workplace pension scheme where you and they pay some money in. This is known as automatic enrolment. But do not assume this will be enough to provide you with a big payout: the minimum total contribution into the scheme is 8% of your pay, regardless of your age. As an older worker, you will have much less time to pay in and much less time for the fund to grow than if you were in your 20s. The state pension If you have made at least 10 years’ worth of national insurance contributions over your adult life, you will be entitled to some level of pension from the state. The maximum state pension for 2021-22 is £179.60 a week, which is £9,339.20 a year. To get that, you will need to have 35 years of contributions. For an estimate of how much state pension you could receive, check your forecast here. It is possible to boost your weekly state pension by delaying starting to draw it, Altmann says. Your state pension increases by the equivalent of 1% for every nine weeks you delay – or defer – claiming it, which works out at just under 5.8% for every 52 weeks. So if you are entitled to £179.60 a week, by deferring for 52 weeks you will get an extra £10.42 a week. “However, of course, you are not receiving any state pension until you do start taking it. Therefore, you may get a higher state pension but you need to live for a long time after you start taking it, in order to make up for the period in which you received nothing at all,” Altmann says. How much to start saving “There is no reliable hard and fast rule” to tell you how much to pay in, Altmann says. The traditional rule of thumb is that you should set aside about half your age expressed as a percentage of income. That would mean a 50-year-old saving 25% of their salary into a pension. “But of course, none of this is accurate because it will depend on what pension you have already built up so far and what your aims are for a level of pension income that you would want,” she adds. As an example, a pension pot of £100,000 could get you a retirement income on top of your state pension of perhaps £4,000 to £5,000 a year on average. The investment company Fidelity says that to get a pot of £100,000, with a target retirement age of 67, based on a relatively cautious investment style and assuming average market performance, you would need to put away a considerable sum if you only start at age 55: about £650 a month. If you start at 45, it is a lot less: about £300 a month. These figures were calculated using Fidelity’s online retirement planning tool called MyPlan. The carry forward allowance It may be worth checking to see if you have any unused annual allowances on your pension savings. The government places a cap on the amount you can save in your pension pots every year before you have to pay tax. This cap is known as the annual allowance and is £40,000 this tax year. Your annual allowance is made up of all contributions to your pension(s) made by you or anyone else, such as your employer. However, some people who are on a mission to build up their pot may be able to carry forward annual allowance they did not use from previous tax years. “Carry forward allows you to make use of unused annual allowances from the three previous tax years if you have used all your annual allowance for the current tax year. This means you may be able to contribute more to your pension pot this tax year (until midnight on 5 April 2022) and still benefit from tax relief, as long as you have the relevant earnings equivalent to the amount you want to contribute,” says Maike Currie, an investment director at Fidelity. Carry forward may be particularly useful if you are self-employed and your earnings change significantly each year, or if you are looking to make large pension contributions, the Pensions Advisory Service says.","charCount":"6713","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"Amanda Hall-Davis and <a href=\"profile/rupertjones\">Rupert Jones</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"}]}}

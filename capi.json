Coco Gauff kicks things off on Philippe-Chatrier against Barbora Krejcikova. At 17, she is the youngest grand slam quarter-finalist for 15 years, but you can’t help feeling that this is just another tiny milestone in what will surely be a remarkable career. </p> <p>Both players will be nervous, though. The unseeded Krejcikova beat Sloane Stephens to reach this stage but admitted afterwards that she nearly didn’t take the court in the fourth-round due to nerves. She is traditionally a doubles player, but this is the first time she has reached the last eight of a grand slam. </p> <p><em>“You know, half an hour before the match, I didn’t even want to step on the court, because I just felt really bad, and I had to lock myself in the physio room and I had to talk to my psychologist. I was actually crying. We talked about it a lot, and she told me, ‘If you can overcome this, what you feel right now, it’s going to be a huge win, and it doesn’t matter if you’re going to win on the court or lose on the court, because it’s going to be a personal win’.” I think after the first point things got a little bit better, a little bit easier. Then I broke her. I just felt like yeah, you know, I can play, I can actually play her. So I think I was just more stressed that I’m just not going to be good enough. I think that’s what happened.”</em></p> <p>We join the match with Gauff an break up at 3-0 in the first set. After a double fault on the first point of the match, Gauff has certainly come out of the traps with more authority. Perhaps with the above comments, that is not surprising. But perhaps Krejcikova will take her time to grow into the match. </p> <h2>Wednesday’s order of play</h2> <ul> <li>Coco Gauff v Barbora Krejcíkova</li> <li>Maria Sakkari v Iga Swiatek</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Diego Schwartzman v Rafael Nadal</li> <li>Novak Djokovic v Matteo Berrettini</li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-06-09T10:21:19.945Z\">at 11.21am BST</time></p>  </div>","wordcount":"1474","firstPublicationDate":"2021-06-09T09:23:42Z","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2021-06-09T10:35:56Z","liveBloggingNow":"true","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/p/hmxg5","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/93af59adab122484e29f04604698b27f4b0efaca/0_179_1742_1045/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","isLive":"true","bodyText":"Second set: Gauff* 6-7 (6), 0-3 Krejcikova (*denotes next server) The sound of an ambulance can be heard careering down some Parisian street outside Chatrier, and one can’t help feeling that it might be for Gauff, who is playing herself out of the tournament here.

These involve checks on some goods, and potentially some restrictions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2021/jun/08/brexit-eustice-sausages-eu-northern-ireland-protocol-g7-covid-live?page=with:block-60bf1e1b8f0827600c04c306#block-60bf1e1b8f0827600c04c306\">(including later this year on sausages and other chilled meats)</a> to protect the EU single market, which includes Northern Ireland. The UK agreed to all these rules when it signed the Northern Ireland protocol. But now it is arguing that there is a need for a rethink because: a) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2021/jun/08/brexit-eustice-sausages-eu-northern-ireland-protocol-g7-covid-live?page=with:block-60bf5b688f0837b8708e1127#block-60bf5b688f0837b8708e1127\">the EU is being too “purist” in enforcing these rules</a>; and b) the UK did not fully realise what the protocol would involve.</p> <p>Frost made this latter argument in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eb35a108-6186-42a4-b401-5e1df0e2c64a\">an article for the Financial Times (paywall)</a> at the weekend. He wrote:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We expected to be able to operate it in a way which respected the sensitive politics in Northern Ireland — after all that was the point of making special arrangements in the first place ...</p> <p>We underestimated the effect of the protocol on goods movements to Northern Ireland, with some suppliers in Great Britain simply not sending their products because of the time-consuming paperwork required. </p> </blockquote> <p>This morning <strong>Gavin Barwell,</strong> who as Theresa May’s chief of staff was fully involved in the Brexit talks until the summer of 2019, said it was just not plausible for Boris Johnson to claim that he did not know what he was signing up to. Barwell told the Today programme:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I don’t think the EU is ever going to think that is credible. The EU negotiating team have obviously worked very closely with the British negotiating team under both governments. They know the quality of the civil servants involved in that work, and they know that British ministers would have been have been advised in detail on the implications of what they were signing up to. </p> <p>So I don’t think anyone who’s involved in the process is going to find it credible that the government signed up to something and didn’t understand what the consequences of that were. </p> </blockquote> <p>Asked if he thought that the government was now only pretending that it did not realise how damaging the protocol would be when it signed it in 2019, Barwell said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It’s difficult to conceive of any other explanation. When I was working with Theresa [May], Boris Johnson was foreign secretary for a period of that time. He perfectly well understood what the previous iteration of the protocol meant in terms of regulatory checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</p> <p>When the deal was published and the government brought its legislation forward, the explanatory memorandum for the bill, which explained what the bill meant, was very clear what the consequences would be. </p> <p>And I think he and David Frost are intelligent people. I find it inconceivable that they didn’t understand what they were signing up to. They would have been advised very clearly by the civil service about that.</p> <p>And I think it’s also important to consider the political context at the time. When Boris took over, he initially tried to prorogue parliament and leave without a deal. He wasn’t able to do that.

As PA Media reports, Billy Hutchinson, the Progressive Unionist party (PUP) leader told a Westminster committee the only way to resolve issues around the Northern Ireland protocol was through political means. PA says: However, Hutchinson warned that loyalist leaders had a “very difficult” job convincing some people within their community that protests should remain peaceful, claiming the reason the trade border was not placed on the Irish land border was due to the threat of republican violence. The PUP has a long-established link with the loyalist paramilitary organisation the Ulster Volunteer Force. Hutchinson, a Belfast city councillor, told the Northern Ireland affairs committee that the European single market represented the biggest threat to his British identity. “People are angry, people misunderstood how Brexit was going to play out and people didn’t realise that Brexit would have a bigger impact in Northern Ireland than it would have in the rest of the UK,” he said. “So the protocol is a manifestation of people attacking their Britishness or taking something away.” Here is my colleague David Conn’s story on the high court ruling on the award of the contract to Public First being illegal. Adults living in the most deprived areas of England are three times more likely to be hesitant about getting a coronavirus vaccine than those in the least deprived parts, PA Media reports. PA says: One in 10 people in the most deprived parts reported vaccine hesitancy between 28 April and 23 May, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This compares with 3% of those in the least deprived areas. Overall, hesitancy levels in Britain are slightly down from the previous month, the survey of 15,173 adults aged 16 years and over found. Some 94% of adults in Britain reported positive sentiment, while 6% reported hesitancy, compared with 93% and 7% respectively between 31 March and 25 April. One in eight (13%) of those aged 16-29 reported hesitancy - the highest proportion of all the age groups and unchanged from the previous month. Black or black British adults were the ethnic group reporting the highest level of vaccine hesitancy, at 21%. Jolyon Maugham, head of the Good Law Project, says the high court has ruled that the Cabinet Office’s decision to award a public opinion research contract worth £560,000 to a company with Tory links without putting it out to tender was unlawful. The Good Law Project has written up the ruling here. And the 43-page judgment is here (pdf). And here is the conclusion from Mrs Justice O’Farrell. For the reasons set out above, the claimant’s challenge to the defendant’s decision to award a contract to Public First and the award of the contract fails on grounds 1 and 2 but succeeds on ground 3. The claimant is entitled to a declaration that the decision of 5 June 2020 to award the contract to Public First gave rise to apparent bias and was unlawful. Following hand down of this judgment, the hearing will be adjourned to a date to be fixed for the purpose of any consequential matters, including any applications for permission to appeal, and any time limits are extended until such hearing or further order. Boris Johnson has thanked police officers for their work during the pandemic in a surprise video address to the Police Federation conference this morning. Delivering what he said was a “huge thank you”, he said: You’ve encouraged people to stick to the rules the same time as you’ve been fighting crime and you’ve each risen to an enormous challenge. Just as I could never have imagined being forced, as prime minister, to close pubs and bars and restaurants or tell people how many households could get together, I bet that policing restrictions in that way was not something you ever dreamt you would be doing. But you did it because you knew it was how we were going to protect the NHS and save lives. Johnson also said that the government had recruited 8,771 new officers and that it was 44% of the way towards the target of 20,000 extra officers by 2023. Arlene Foster, the outgoing DUP first minister of Northern Ireland, does not seem to agree with Gavin Barwell’s analysis of who is to blame for the problems with the Northern Ireland protocol. (See 8.48am.) She has posted this response to a tweet from the former Ukip MEP Patrick O’Flynn. More than 80% of adults in England and Wales would test positive for Covid antibodies, according to figures released by the Office for National Statistics this morning. The figures are lower for Northern Ireland (79.9%) and for Scotland (72.6%). Having antibodies can protect people from further infection. People acquire antibodies either through vaccination, or from being infected in the past. But antibody levels do not correspond to the total number of people vaccinated and infected in the past because over time antibody levels reduce to the point where they are no longer detected in tests. Here are the figures for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. They cover the week beginning Monday 17 May, and they are based on the results of a survey that involves tens of thousands of people being tested at random. And these charts compare the proportion of adults testing positive for antibodies (the dark blue line) with the proportion who have had one dose of vaccine (the green line) and the proportion fully vaccinated (the light green line). Lord Frost and his EU counterpart Maroš Šefčovič, vice-president of the European Commission, have started their talks at Admiralty House in London. Although it essentially one event, technically there are two meetings taking place: a meeting of the withdrawal agreement joint committee meeting (the body set up to oversee the implementation of the withdrawal agreement, including the Northern Ireland protocol); and a meeting of the partnership council (the body set up to oversee the implementation of the UK-EU trade deal, the trade and cooperation agreement). Frost and Šefčovič jointly chair both bodies. Here is the agenda (pdf) for the withdrawal agreement joint committee meeting. And here is the agenda (pdf) for the partnership council meeting. In a statement issued last night, ahead of his meeting this morning with Maroš Šefčovič, Lord Frost, the Brexit minister, urged the EU to adopt “pragmatism” and “common sense solutions” to resolve the problems in Northern Ireland. He said: I hope this will be a productive forum where we can address shared challenges by working together in the spirit of mutual trust and cooperation. First among these challenges is the damaging impact the protocol is having on the ground in Northern Ireland. Businesses in Great Britain are choosing not to sell their goods into Northern Ireland because of burdensome paperwork, medicine manufacturers are threatening to cut vital supplies, and chilled meats from British farmers destined for the Northern Ireland market are at risk of being banned entirely ... Our overriding shared priority must be to protect the Belfast (Good Friday) agreement and the peace process. I look to the EU to show flexibility and engage with our proposals so that we can find solutions that enjoy the confidence of all communities. Further threats of legal action and trade retaliation from the EU won’t make life any easier for the shopper in Strabane who can’t buy their favourite product. Nor will it benefit the small business in Ballymena struggling to source produce from their supplier in Birmingham. What is needed is pragmatism and common sense solutions to resolve the issues as they are before us. This work is important. And it is ever more urgent. Good morning. Lord Frost, the Brexit minister, is holding talks this morning with his EU counterpart, Maroš Šefčovič, in an attempt to resolve the increasingly acrimonious dispute about the post-Brexit rules in place governing trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. These involve checks on some goods, and potentially some restrictions (including later this year on sausages and other chilled meats) to protect the EU single market, which includes Northern Ireland. The UK agreed to all these rules when it signed the Northern Ireland protocol. But now it is arguing that there is a need for a rethink because: a) the EU is being too “purist” in enforcing these rules; and b) the UK did not fully realise what the protocol would involve. Frost made this latter argument in an article for the Financial Times (paywall) at the weekend. He wrote: We expected to be able to operate it in a way which respected the sensitive politics in Northern Ireland — after all that was the point of making special arrangements in the first place ... We underestimated the effect of the protocol on goods movements to Northern Ireland, with some suppliers in Great Britain simply not sending their products because of the time-consuming paperwork required. This morning Gavin Barwell, who as Theresa May’s chief of staff was fully involved in the Brexit talks until the summer of 2019, said it was just not plausible for Boris Johnson to claim that he did not know what he was signing up to. Barwell told the Today programme: I don’t think the EU is ever going to think that is credible. The EU negotiating team have obviously worked very closely with the British negotiating team under both governments. They know the quality of the civil servants involved in that work, and they know that British ministers would have been have been advised in detail on the implications of what they were signing up to. So I don’t think anyone who’s involved in the process is going to find it credible that the government signed up to something and didn’t understand what the consequences of that were. Asked if he thought that the government was now only pretending that it did not realise how damaging the protocol would be when it signed it in 2019, Barwell said: It’s difficult to conceive of any other explanation. When I was working with Theresa [May], Boris Johnson was foreign secretary for a period of that time. He perfectly well understood what the previous iteration of the protocol meant in terms of regulatory checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. When the deal was published and the government brought its legislation forward, the explanatory memorandum for the bill, which explained what the bill meant, was very clear what the consequences would be. And I think he and David Frost are intelligent people. I find it inconceivable that they didn’t understand what they were signing up to. They would have been advised very clearly by the civil service about that. And I think it’s also important to consider the political context at the time. When Boris took over, he initially tried to prorogue parliament and leave without a deal. He wasn’t able to do that. So he then decided that he wanted to call an election to strengthen his position and it was clearly easier to fight that an election within an “oven-ready” Brexit deal. So I think the calculation was sign up to whatever is on offer, and then see if we can deal with anything we don’t like down the line. I think the EU have come to the same conclusion as me and that’s why they’re taking the approach that they are now. Barwell was expanding in his interview on a claim he made on Twitter on Monday. Yesterday Downing Street said Barwell’s analysis was wrong. Here is the agenda for the day. Morning: Lord Frost, the Brexit minister, and Maroš Šefčovič, his EU counterpart, co-chair a meeting of the partnership council and the withdrawal agreement joint committee, which will mostly focus on the Northern Ireland protocol. 9.30am: The ONS publishes new figures on vaccine hesitancy, and on antibody levels in the UK. 11.15am: Priti Patel, the home secretary, gives a speech to the Police Federation. 12pm: Boris Johnson faces Sir Keir Starmer at PMQs. 12.30pm: Šefčovič holds a press briefing after his meeting with Frost. After 12.30pm: MPs begin a debate on a Labour motion criticising the government’s plans to help pupils make up for the learning lost during the pandemic. It says “the current half-hearted approach risks failing hundreds of thousands of young people” and calls for a more ambitious plan. 1.30pm: Downing Street is expected to hold its daily lobby briefing.

The FBI only closed its investigation in 2016.

Here, the writers Eric Martin and Bisha K Ali appear to be trying to answer the question: “What would Marvel’s Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy look like?” A beautiful, surreal, mid-century modern bureaucratic nightmare designed by Dieter Rams is their answer. And I simply can’t wait for more. Further minutes The DB Cooper snippet was perfect. Loki’s mid-air bifrosting was in the trailer, presumed to be part of some death-defying, pivotal-to-the-plot action sequence. But no, it was a little joke stating that Loki was DB Cooper, the unidentified man who, in 1971, hijacked a Boeing 727 over the US, demanded $200,000 (which he collected), before parachuting from the plane and disappearing. The FBI only closed its investigation in 2016. I enjoyed this playful subplot, not least because it nods to Mad Men, a clear stylistic influence on Loki, and the fact that armchair sleuths theorised Don Draper was DB Cooper for some time before that show’s finale. Whether you enjoyed this episode or not (I loved it, if you can’t tell), it’s hard to argue with its aesthetic beauty. I’m now scrolling through images of the Atlanta Marriott Marquis, which doubled as the TVA HQ. Let’s salute the British talent on display here, Hiddleston, Mosaku and Gugu Mbatha-Raw, who will hopefully have a bigger part to play as the series goes on. I could easily sit through an entire season of Marvel explainers drawn in that Friz Freleng/Pink Panther style. In fact, I could probably watch just about anything. I thought the infinity stones being used as paperweights as a demonstration of the TVA’s power was a masterstroke; the thing that finally made Loki see that what he’d been craving all along was futile. What did you think? Do you enjoy the premise? What does “fine Asgardian leather” feel like? Was that Mephisto hiding in the church window?

The prospect of Iranian crude exports returning faded as the US secretary of state said sanctions against Tehran were unlikely to be lifted. Brent crude, the global benchmark, rose to $72.83 a barrel earlier, the highest since May 2019, and is now trading 25 cents higher at $72.47 a barrel. US West Texas Intermediate crude reached a near-three-year high of $70.62, and is currently up 21 cents at $70.26 a barrel. Analysts at PVM Oil Associates said: The widespread faith that oil demand growth will trend significantly higher in the second half of the year is paving the way forward for the price rally. El Salvador has become the first country to adopt bitcoin as legal tender. Lawmakers in the Central American country’s Congress voted by a “supermajority” in favour of the Bitcoin Law, which received 62 out of 84 votes.

A BA spokesperson said: During this unprecedented crisis we have issued well over 3m refunds and helped millions of our customers change their travel dates or destinations and we’re grateful to them for their ongoing support. We continue to offer highly flexible booking policies at the same time as operating a vastly reduced schedule due to government-imposed travel restrictions, and we have acted lawfully at all times. It is incredible that the government is seeking to punish further an industry that is on its knees, after prohibiting airlines from meaningful flying for well over a year now. Any action taken against our industry will only serve to destabilise it, with potential consequences for jobs, business, connectivity and the UK economy. And Ryanair said: Ryanair today welcomed the UK CMA’s update on its review of airline policies on refund requests made by UK consumers whose flights operated during periods of lockdown. Ryanair has approached such refund requests on a case by case basis and has paid refunds in justified cases. Since June 2020, all our customers have also had the ability to rebook their flights without paying a change fee and millions of our UK customers have availed of this option. Travel stocks are up this morning after the EU parliament approved vaccine passports to ease travel this summer. This has boosted the Anglo-German tour operator Tui, along with airlines IAG, the BA owner (up 2.1%), easyJet (up 1.3%) and Ryanair (up 1%). Intercontinental Hotels Group and Premier Inn owner Whitbread are also higher, by 1% and 0.5% respectively. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, says: Meanwhile, the US eased travel restrictions for 61 countries, but not the UK. Nevertheless, there is a real sense that vaccines are working to open up the US, EU and UK to travel this summer, albeit not quite how it once was.

I’m aiming to create an eco-friendly home, but the property is a 200-year-old, Grade II-listed house, so it’s quite challenging to insulate and update. As the founder of a green tech company, I do try to stick to those values by living an offsetting lifestyle.”</p> <p>Over the years, Daniel has registered patents for everything from collapsible keyboards to a wearable computer with a necklace-like strap – a forefather of the smartwatches worn by millions today. And now he’s turned his attention to the emerging field of smart home batteries – “like a hot water tank for power”, he explains.

I’m aiming to create an eco-friendly home, but the property is a 200-year-old, Grade II-listed house, so it’s quite challenging to insulate and update. As the founder of a green tech company, I do try to stick to those values by living an offsetting lifestyle.” Over the years, Daniel has registered patents for everything from collapsible keyboards to a wearable computer with a necklace-like strap – a forefather of the smartwatches worn by millions today. And now he’s turned his attention to the emerging field of smart home batteries – “like a hot water tank for power”, he explains. Home batteries enable households to store energy to use later, giving homeowners the chance to buy electricity when it’s cheap and renewable at off-peak times, or generate and store their own using solar panels. “There are tens of thousands of people with batteries in their homes in the UK, and hundreds of thousands in the US,” he says. “It’s still in the early stages for battery technology, but green innovations like these work best alongside smart meters, which offer better prices for off-peak charging, helping households top up batteries with energy when it’s low-carbon.

The cap on 30 attendees was one of the restrictions the UK government roadmap touted being lifted “no earlier” than 21 June. Jenrick said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We’ve always said that the roadmap is subject to review of the data, and that is what is happening right now.

A total of 879 patients with Covid-19 were in hospital in England as of 8am on 8 June, according to NHS England. This is up from 776 one week earlier - a rise of 13%. It is also up 20% from a low of 730 patients on 22 May. This comes as Government ministers are reviewing the latest data on Covid-19 cases and the amount of people being taken to hospital to decide whether the planned easing of social restrictions in England on 21 June will go ahead. Patient numbers are not increasing steadily, with the total sometimes falling slightly one day before jumping again the next. But even when using a seven-day average to smooth out these kinds of fluctuations, the trend is now upwards. These figures are still well below the second-wave peak, when the number of patients reached a record high average of 33,594 on 22 January. The upwards trend is also not being reflected in every region of England. Covid-19 case rates are currently rising in four out of five local areas of England - the highest proportion since early January. Public health experts have said that the country could expect to see rising case numbers as restrictions were eased – but the key metric is whether this would lead to increased hospitalisations and a repeat risk of overwhelming the NHS. Earlier today NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson seemed very clear that vaccines appear to have “broken” the link between infections, hospital admission and deaths in the UK. Intensive care beds for Covid patients in Malaysia have reached full capacity, according to the country’s health director general, who said the country’s pandemic remained at a critical level. Malaysia’s king has started a series of meetings with leaders of political parties, amid public discontent over the government’s handling of a coronavirus crisis that has forced the nation into a third lockdown. UK housing minister Robert Jenrick has told people hoping to get married after 21 June that “I wouldn’t make plans until you’ve heard from the prime minister” over attendance numbers. The government’s roadmap had suggested the cap of 30 attendees would be lifted “no earlier” than 21 June, and many couple will have planned on that basis. NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson has told Times Radio this morning that vaccines appear to have “broken” the link between infections, hospital admission and deaths in the UK. A judge has ruled that the UK government acted unlawfully when it awarded a contract for polling the public about Covid messaging without a tender last March. The company was owned by friends of Dominic Cummings, then British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s chief adviser. The mayor of Greater Manchester in England, Andy Burnham, has offered a rare bit of praise to the government for “surging support” into areas where there are high case numbers after health secretary Matt Hancock announced that a “strengthened package of support” will be provided for Greater Manchester and Lancashire. But he urged people to “minimise” the number of people they watch England’s Euro 2020 match against Croatia with this weekend. The UK’s competition watchdog has launched action against British Airways and Ryanair over their refusal to give refunds to people during UK lockdowns, when they were “lawfully unable to fly” due to travel bans and restrictions imposed by the government. Andrew Lloyd-Webber has said he will reopen his London theatres at the end of June regardless of restrictions, inviting the government to have him arrested. Confidence in the EU’s ability to handle crises has taken a hit from Covid-19, a major survey shows, but dissatisfaction with national political systems is even higher and most people still support EU membership and want a stronger, more cooperative bloc. Three people were killed in a blaze that broke out at a Russian hospital treating patients with Covid-19, authorities said, with one official suggesting a faulty ventilator was to blame. Additionally, Russia has reported 10,407 new coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours, its highest number of daily infections since early March. Indonesia has reported 7,725 new coronavirus infections, the highest daily number since 26 February. Taiwan has reported 274 new local cases of Covid-19 today, mostly in New Taipei city. Another 25 people have died, bringing Taiwan’s total death toll to 296. Dr David Nabarro, special envoy on Covid-19 for the World Health Organization, has said British prime minister Boris Johnson’s commitment to vaccinating the entire world by the end of next year could be a “gift for generations to come”. Doctors, pharmacists and workplaces in Australia can now incentivise people to receive the Covid-19 vaccine by offering rewards including cash, prizes and complementary and alternative medicines, in a move a professor of public health and expert on drugs regulation, Prof Ken Harvey, has described as “utter craziness”. The US state department has eased travel recommendations for more than 110 countries and territories, including Japan just ahead of the Olympics. Also in the US, a pharmacist has been jailed for three years after pleading guilty to trying to spoil hundreds of doses of the Moderna vaccine because he was skeptical about them. Andrew Sparrow has our UK live blog, which will have its main focus on Brexit, PMQs and the G7 meeting today. I’ll continue to bring you the top lines from the UK on Covid as well as the rest of the coronavirus news from around the world. One of those stories today that is likely to feature in both Andrew Sparrow’s UK politics live blog, and here on our Covid blog, but a judge has just ruled that the government acted unlawfully when it awarded a contract without a tender last March to a polling company owned by friends of Dominic Cummings, then British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s chief adviser. When the pandemic then hit, Cummings urged civil servants to hire the company Public First to hold focus groups on the government’s Covid-19 health messaging. Mrs Justice O’Farrell, who gave the ruling on the Cabinet Office contract with the company Public First, said: “The decision of 5 June 2020 to award the contract to Public First gave rise to apparent bias and was unlawful.” Read more of David Conn’s report for us here: Covid contract for firm run by Cummings friends was unlawful, judge rules Indonesia has reported 7,725 new coronavirus infections, the highest daily number since 26 February, data from the country’s Covid-19 taskforce showed. Reuters note that the task force also reported 170 people died from Covid on Wednesday, taking the total to 52,162. Joseph Sipalan has this despatch for Reuters from Kuala Lumpur, where he reports Malaysia’s king has started a series of meetings with leaders of political parties, amid public discontent over the government’s handling of a coronavirus crisis that has forced the nation into a third lockdown. Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin’s administration imposed strict Covid-19 measures from June 1-14 to address a surge in infections and deaths, on top of an ongoing national emergency to curb the spread of the disease. But those have led to public frustration over a perceived slow rollout of vaccinations, haphazard policymaking and uneven enforcement of coronavirus curbs that critics say royalty and elites have been allowed to skirt. Opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, who spent an hour with King Al-Sultan Abdullah, said the national emergency has done more harm than good. “We presented our view that allowing this emergency to continue will lead to losses to the country,” Anwar told reporters. “It does not help with the handling of Covid and it effects the economy, especially those in the lower rungs of society.” Muhyiddin was the first to meet with the king, ahead of his weekly cabinet meeting. Other political leaders are expected at the palace over the next few days, including ex-premier Mahathir Mohamad. In a statement, the national palace said the king has convened a special meeting of the council of rulers on Wednesday to discuss efforts to battle the epidemic during the emergency. Intensive care beds for Covid patients in Malaysia have reached full capacity [see 6.11], according to the country’s health director general, who said the country’s pandemic remained at a critical level. My colleague Sarah Marsh has a recap here of those important words from NHS Providers chief executive, Chris Hopson, that the link between Covid cases and deaths has been broken. Three people were killed in a blaze that broke out at a Russian hospital treating patients with Covid-19, authorities said, with one official suggesting a faulty ventilator was to blame. The fire broke out in the early hours of Wednesday at a hospital in the city of Ryazan, some 180 kilometres (112 miles) from Moscow, in a ward treating Covid-19 patients. The region’s governor, Nikolai Lyubimov, told state television that a ventilator in the ward had overheated and caught fire, the Interfax news agency reported. Nurses attempted to extinguish the blaze, but were unsuccessful in doing so, with some of them sustaining severe burns, the governor said. Reuters note that since the start of the pandemic, Russia has reported several fires at intensive care units that doctors said were caused by malfunctioning ventilators used to treat patients severely ill with the virus. Andrew Sparrow has begun publishing our UK live blog for the day. I suspect there will be a lot of politics in it today. I’ll continue to have top UK lines as well as the global Covid news. Russia has reported 10,407 new coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours, its highest number of daily infections since early March, taking the national tally to 5,156,250 since the pandemic began. Regular readers will note that I’ve expressed some scepticism about how Russia’s official figures basically haven’t moved for months, which doesn’t feel like how the pandemic has behaved elsewhere. Reuters said the government coronavirus task force reported 399 people had died, pushing the national death toll to 124,895. The federal statistics agency has kept a separate toll and has said that Russia recorded around 270,000 deaths related to Covid-19 between April 2020 and April 2021. Gerald Imray reports for Associated Press from Cape Town that in South Africa, which has Africa’s most robust economy and its biggest coronavirus caseload, just 0.8% of the population is fully vaccinated. Hundreds of thousands of the country’s health workers, many of whom come face-to-face with the virus every day, are still waiting for their shots. The picture is similar with other African nations. In Nigeria, Africa’s biggest country with more than 200 million people, only 0.1% are fully protected. Kenya, with 50 million people, is even lower. Uganda has recalled doses from rural areas because it doesn’t have nearly enough to fight outbreaks in big cities. Chad didn’t administer its first vaccine shots until this past weekend. And there are at least five other countries in Africa where not one dose has been put into an arm, according to the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The World Health Organization says the continent of 1.3 billion people is facing a severe shortage of vaccine at the same time a new wave of infections is rising across Africa. Vaccine shipments into Africa have ground to a “near halt”, WHO said last week. In an interview, Nkengasong called on the leaders of wealthy nations meeting this week at the G7 summit to share spare vaccines – something the US has already agreed to do – and avert a “moral catastrophe”. “I’d like to believe that the G7 countries, most of them having kept excess doses of vaccines, want to be on the right side of history,” Nkengasong said. “Distribute those vaccines. We need to actually see these vaccines, not just … promises and goodwill.” Others are not so patient, nor so diplomatic. “People are dying. Time is against us. This IS INSANE,” South African human rights lawyer Fatima Hasan, an activist for equal access to health care, wrote in a series of text messages. NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson has told Times Radio this morning that vaccines appear to have “broken” the link between infections, hospital admission and deaths in the UK, and hospitals were reporting less sick, younger patients than before. He added: “And if, and it is a big if, if Bolton has gone through its complete cycle and if others areas follow Bolton, the view from the hospital there was that they were able to cope with the level of infections. “It’s important not to just focus on the raw numbers here … you also do need to look at who’s being admitted into hospital and how clinically vulnerable and what level of acuity they’ve got. “What chief executives are consistently telling us is that it is a much younger population that is coming in, they are less clinically vulnerable, they are less in need of critical care and therefore they’re seeing what they believe is significantly lower mortality rate which is, you know, borne out by the figures. So it’s not just the numbers of people who are coming in, it’s actually the level of harm and clinical risk.” However, PA Media reports he said those people who are admitted but survive may still end up with long Covid. Taiwan has reported 274 new local cases of Covid-19 today, mostly in New Taipei city. Another 25 people have died, bringing Taiwan’s total death toll to 296. Health authorities have just given their daily update, and the numbers are higher than the previous two days but lower than last week. There are currently 2,542 people in hospital and 1,486 with milder cases in centralised quarantine facilities. More than 10% of deaths – which have skewed older in this outbreak – occurred before the patient got to hospital, Testing capacity has also increased, with the ability for 48,000 PCR tests a day, up from 27,600. Health and welfare minister Chen Shih-chung has also reminded local governments that they should be following the protocols established under alert level 3, which limits gatherings and closes some shops, but doesn’t lock people inside. He made the comments in response to reports of the Miaoli county government ordering migrant workers be kept to their dorms and not allowed out except to go to work. A growing cluster of hundreds of cases across four factories is quickly becoming the new focus of this outbreak, and there are a lot of allegations around that migrant workers – of whom there are around 430,000 in the manufacturing industry primarily living in dormitories – are being treated at a different standard to Taiwanese employees. There is some pushback on the government’s handling of this outbreak, including its preparations for the known risk of outbreaks in migrant worker dorms, and over the level 3 rules for the general public. Employers are still only encouraged to facilitate working from home, and there are wide reports that many are still making workers go in - even if not strictly necessary. Meanwhile outdoor areas are closed. Dr David Nabarro, special envoy on Covid-19 for the World Health Organization, has said British prime minister Boris Johnson’s commitment to vaccinating the entire world by the end of next year could be a “gift for generations to come”. “I am absolutely delighted that the British prime minister has made this call to action for the world to get vaccinated by the end of next year,” he told Sky News.“And he’s going to use his leadership of the G7 group of nations to make this point. “So I think like many, I am hoping that world leaders in the G7 will just say very clearly: ‘We are going to work together to make sure that the world is vaccinated adequately by the end of 2022’. That would be a gift for generations to come. And it’s the kind of leadership that really we’re expecting and hoping to see in the coming weeks.” He added: “The reality is that it will be a massive undertaking to ensure that everybody has access to a vaccine, it will be a massive undertaking to make sure that enough vaccine is available and the vaccines are constantly modified in the light of new variants emerging. But this is doable. “It’s not in the big scheme of things a massive expenditure, it just requires everybody saying we’re going to work together on this job.” Nabarro may have over-estimated not only the extent to which Boris Johnson habitually sees his grand projects through to the end – garden bridge anyone? – but also under-estimated practicalities of it. Yesterday my colleague Sarah Boseley assessed how feasible it might be… The mayor of Greater Manchester in England, Andy Burnham, has offered a rare bit of praise to the government for “surging support” into areas where there are high case numbers after health secretary Matt Hancock announced that a “strengthened package of support” will be provided for Greater Manchester and Lancashire. “We very much appreciate the help of the government. It’s a reversal of where we were last year,” he said on BBC Breakfast. “Then we were getting restrictions put on us without support. This is an approach where the restrictions are being managed nationally through the road map. We’ve been working closely with the government on this. It’s a sensible approach and we support it.” Burnham has encouraged residents in parts of Lancashire and Greater Manchester to “minimise” the number of people they watch England’s Euro 2020 match against Croatia with this weekend after a rise in coronavirus cases in the areas. PA report he said: “If you look to this weekend with the weather looking good in Greater Manchester, which is great for everybody with the football coming, we would say minimise the number of people you watch the match with. Watch it outside if you can.” Burnham has also been on the Radio 4 Today programme, where he is been making the point that surge vaccinations could provide a key route out of the local restrictions that areas of the north-west of England are being asked to follow. There’s already been some pushback on that investigation by the CMA into the refund policies of British Airways and Ryanair, as you might imagine. PA Media is reporting that a spokeswoman for British Airways said the company has issued more than 3m refunds. They added: “We continue to offer highly flexible booking policies at the same time as operating a vastly reduced schedule due to government-imposed travel restrictions, and we have acted lawfully at all times. “It is incredible that the government is seeking to punish further an industry that is on its knees, after prohibiting airlines from meaningful flying for well over a year now. “Any action taken against our industry will only serve to destabilise it, with potential consequences for jobs, business, connectivity and the UK economy.” The UK’s competition watchdog has launched action against British Airways and Ryanair over their refusal to give refunds to people during UK lockdowns, when they were “lawfully unable to fly” due to travel bans and restrictions imposed by the government. BA offered vouchers or rebooking and Ryanair only the option to rebook. The Competition and Markets Authority started an investigation in December. It said this morning it is “concerned that, by failing to offer people their money back, both firms may have breached consumer law and left people unfairly out of pocket. It is now seeking to resolve these concerns with the companies, which may include seeking refunds, or other redress, for affected customers”. This relates to “periods when it was unlawful in one or more parts of the UK for people to travel for non-essential reasons. It covers flights that were not cancelled, and does not cover any other situations”. Andrea Coscelli, the chief executive of the CMA, said: While we understand that airlines have had a tough time during the pandemic, people should not be left unfairly out of pocket for following the law. Customers booked these flights in good faith and were legally unable to take them due to circumstances entirely outside of their control. We believe these people should have been offered their money back. My colleague Julia Kollewe will have more on this as it unfolds on our business live blog: UK’s CMA launches action against BA and Ryanair over refunds – business live UK government ministers could not justify spending millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money hiring consultants to assess applicants for its £500m Covid emergency support package for charities, despite clear bid processes already existing, according to cross-party MPs. Ministers were also unable to explain why a team of political special advisers was given an unusually central role in deciding which charities would receive funding, or why some charities received cash even though their bids initially received low scores. The public accounts committee (PAC) said there was a “notable opaqueness” surrounding decisions on how funds were distributed to charities, with little clarity about how the cash was shared regionally, or what impact it had. MPs were examining the £513m allocated to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) last year to provide financial support for charities to help them meet increased demand during the pandemic. An additional £200m went to hospice charities via the Department of Health and Social Care. The PAC chair, Meg Hillier, said that it was not the first time during the pandemic “worrying smoke” had been thrown up by ministers around Covid support funding decisions, with “growing instances of the official processes overridden without adequate explanations”. “Exorbitant funds” having been spent by consultants without the impact being measured was a recurring pandemic theme, she added. “I fear one clear impact is the steady erosion of taxpayers’ trust that their money is being well spent in this national emergency.” Read more of Patrick Butler’s report here: Millions spent on consultants for Covid scheme ‘not justified’, MPs say The UK’s housing secretary Robert Jenrick is on media duties this morning, and he has said that coronavirus cases are “clearly rising” and that the government is reviewing a range of data to make a decision on the further lifting of restrictions on 21 June. PA Media reports he told Sky News: “The prime minister is reviewing the data, and more data is coming in, which is very important. We created this five-week period between the stages of the road map and that has actually proved invaluable on this occasion, because it’s a finely balanced decision. “We need to see that data of cases, which are clearly rising, but the link to hospitalisations and ultimately to death. So the prime minister is reviewing that ahead of the decision point, which is going to be 14 June – at that point of course he will let everybody know what the ultimate decision is.” He was pressed particularly on the impact on wedding planning, and the current uncertainty over how many people will be able to attend ceremonies during July. The cap on 30 attendees was one of the restrictions the UK government roadmap touted being lifted “no earlier” than 21 June. Jenrick said: We’ve always said that the roadmap is subject to review of the data, and that is what is happening right now. So whether it’s weddings, or international travel, or any of these other important topics, you always have to wait until the judgment is made on the basis of the data. I wouldn’t make plans until you’ve heard from the PM, if that’s important to you, but weddings can go ahead right now but just with the maximum 30 guests. Mongolia is the latest country to begin holding an election where Covid restrictions are in place for voting, and where the handling of the pandemic is going to be a major factor in swaying the vote. The winner will become the sixth president he vast landlocked nation of 3 million people since the peaceful transition from communism to democracy in 1992. Incumbent Battulga Khaltmaa of the Democratic party is barred by the constitution from seeking a second six-year term. Voters are required to observe social distancing, and restrictions on public gatherings have severely curtailed campaign events, prompting candidates to shift much of their outreach to voters online. Mongolia’s already ailing economy has been thrown into crisis due to the pandemic, with 69,022 cases and 324 deaths reported and the number of new local infections hitting a daily record last week. That has forced the temporary closure of markets and other enterprises in the capital of Ulaanbaatar. Pandemic-related disruptions in demand for Mongolia’s chief exports such as coal and copper are also dragging on the economy. Doctors, pharmacists and workplaces in Australia can now incentivise people to receive the Covid-19 vaccine by offering rewards including cash, prizes and complementary and alternative medicines, in a move a professor of public health and expert on drugs regulation, Prof Ken Harvey, has described as “utter craziness”. Since Covid-19 vaccines became available in Australia from February, some doctors have expressed frustration that strict rules around the promotion and advertising of medicines enforced by drugs regulator the Therapeutic Goods Administration has meant they could not promote the vaccines as freely as they would have liked, including directly to patients during consults, or on social media. The regulations are important because they prevent drugs companies and health professionals from making exaggerated claims about medicines and medical devices, and stop drug companies from advertising prescription drugs directly to consumers including through television, radio and social media. But the regulations have also made vaccine promotion difficult during the pandemic. In response, the TGA amended the rules, though only for the promotion of Covid-19 vaccines. While health professionals, corporate entities and media outlets can now communicate information publicly about TGA-approved Covid-19 vaccines, this information must be consistent with current commonwealth health messaging. Any promotion must not reference brand names such as Pfizer or AstraZeneca or any active ingredients that might identify the vaccines. The rules do not allow any statements saying vaccines do not cause harm, or any false or misleading information.

PA Media notes that the department has changed its advice for dozens of nations, including France, Spain and Italy, from “Level 4: Do Not Travel” to “Level 3: Reconsider Travel”, according to its website. The UK has been designated Level 3 since May 10. The Level 3 advice allows travel for fully vaccinated citizens, with a warning they should “avoid travel due to serious risks to safety and security”. However, the UK is still subject to a presidential decree which prohibits non-US citizens who have been in the UK in the last 14 days from entering the country. The full list can be found on the state department website here: US state department travel advisories Overnight PA’s Joe Gammie has rounded-up some more response from the travel industry on the traffic-light system being used for international travel in England – and it is not a warm welcome for it. London-based World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) said the Government must scrap the system which has “wreaked havoc” among consumers and businesses in order to save hundreds of thousands of jobs. Portugal being moved from the green to amber caught many holidaymakers by surprise and left thousands of UK tourists scrambling to get home before new quarantine rules came into force on Tuesday morning. The WTTC said that moving to a more transparent and easier to understand system will restore consumer confidence and provide a “much-needed” boost to the travel and tourism sector. It warned that a further 218,000 jobs were at “serious risk” if international travel continued to be off limits for most of the summer, on top of the 307,000 jobs which were lost in the UK sector last year. WTTC acting CEO Virginia Messina said: “It’s time the Government abandoned the hugely damaging traffic lights system. Consumers, airlines and the wider travel sector were promised a watchlist and three weeks’ notice of any changes from green to amber, and not just four days. “It has been incredibly disruptive and costly for both travel and tourism businesses and consumers. It simply hasn’t worked. What’s needed now is a watertight government policy enabling those who’ve been fully jabbed to travel freely, and not have to self-isolate on their return. “Those who are not fully vaccinated should be able to travel with proof of a negative test, like what we are seeing in the EU. The travel sector needs this now if it is to survive this summer as domestic travel alone will not save the day.” It is already clear what one of the main topics of the UK’s morning media round is going to be: presenters trying to trip up ministers over Andrew Lloyd-Webber’s claim that he was going to reopen his theatres come-what-may and is willing to be arrested over it. The composer said he may have to sell his six West End venues if the government does not remove restrictions that have forced venues to run with reduced capacities. Lloyd Webber is preparing for a production of Cinderella, which is scheduled to open for previews on 25 June ahead of its world premiere in July. “We are going to open, come hell or high water,” Lord Lloyd-Webber told the Telegraph. Asked what he would do if the government postponed lifting lockdown, he said: “We will say: ‘come to the theatre and arrest us.”’ On Sky News, Kay Burley has already been repeatedly pressing housing minister Robert Jenrick on whether Lloyd-Webber should be arrested. For a government that indulged Dominic Cumming’s trip to Durham last year, it is always tricky for a minister to flat-out state that someone should just obey the rules. I’m not sure this is the most enlightening way to tease out current government thinking on whether there will be a delay to England’s planned 21 June reopening. It may well feel like a very long morning of interviews for Jenrick. Confidence in the EU’s ability to handle crises has taken a hit from Covid-19, a major survey shows, but dissatisfaction with national political systems is even higher and most people still support EU membership and want a stronger, more cooperative bloc. The report’s authors suggested the polling should be a wake-up call for Brussels, warning that while public support for the broader European project remained high in many countries, it was fragile and would not easily survive more disappointment. Europeans were “making a distinction between the need for cooperation and solidarity at a European level, and their confidence in the EU to deliver”, they said, and were unhappy the bloc had “missed an opportunity to prove its worth”. The polling also suggested Brexit had changed Europeans’ views of the UK, with the prevailing view now seeing Britain – like the US – as a “necessary partner” to be “strategically cooperated with” rather than an ally, and one in four Germans and one in five French and Spanish respondents considering it as a rival or adversary. The report, published by the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR) on Wednesday, suggested the bloc’s poor early response to the pandemic and slow initial vaccine rollout had dealt a heavy blow to confidence in its capabilities. Read Jon Henley’s full report here: Europeans’ confidence in EU hit by coronavirus response Chinese authorities in Guangdong have taken extraordinary measures to make sure students have been able to sit the crucial gaokao college entrance exams amid an outbreak in the city of Guangzhou. From AFP: The local government has dispatched hundreds of taxis and buses to ferry students from neighbourhoods affected by the outbreak to exam venues, with state broadcaster CCTV showing footage of drivers in hazmat suits spraying down their cars. Students were split into different rooms based on their level of Covid-19 risk, with contacts of confirmed cases taking the tests in smaller groups. But infected students with mild symptoms had to take the tough exams solo in brightly lit isolation rooms in the hospital or special locations. CCTV footage showed one student sitting at a lone desk and scratching his head as he read the exam paper, a bottle of hand sanitizer on the desk and officials monitoring him on a TV screen. Other state footage showed masked examiners in protective clothing removing completed exam papers from infected students and hanging them up on a clothes-drying rack to be sprayed down with disinfectant. Provincial officials inspected testing sites in Guangzhou late last week and urged examiners to make sure “students feel comfortable, parents are at ease and society is reassured,” the local government said. Last year’s gaokao exams were delayed as schools hesitated to resume mass activities due to the coronavirus, which first emerged in the country in late 2019. Life in China has since returned almost to normal, with authorities responding to sporadic outbreaks with aggressive testing and localised quarantines. Guangzhou authorities shut down cinemas and karaoke bars across the city on Tuesday, and have locked down neighbourhoods and ordered travellers leaving the city to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test. China reported eight locally transmitted Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, all of which were detected in Guangdong province. Reuters: The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has eased travel recommendations for more than 110 countries and territories, including Japan just ahead of the Olympics. The Biden administration is forming expert working groups with Canada, Mexico, the European Union and Britain to determine how best to safely restart travel after 15 months of pandemic restrictions, a White House official said on Tuesday. The CDC’s new ratings include 61 nations that were lowered from its highest “level 4” rating that discouraged all travel to recommending travel for fully vaccinated individuals, the agency confirmed on Tuesday. An additional 50 countries and territories have been lowered to “level 2” or “level 1,” a CDC spokeswoman said. Countries ranked lowest for Covid-19 risks now include Singapore, Israel, South Korea, Iceland, Belize and Albania. Among those now listed at “level 3,” are France, Ecuador, the Philippines, South Africa, Canada, Mexico, Russia, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, Honduras, Hungary and Italy. A US pharmacist has been jailed for three years after pleading guilty to trying to spoil hundreds of doses of the Moderna vaccine because he was skeptical about them. The US justice department said on Tuesday the 46-year-old man had also been ordered to pay $83,800 in compensation to the hospital at which he worked. According to a statement from the Wisconsin eastern district’s US Attorney’s office, he pleaded guilty to two counts of attempting to tamper with consumer products with reckless disregard for the risk that another person would be placed in danger of death or bodily injury. According to justice department, in December 2020 the man deliberately removed a box of vaccine vials from a hospital refrigeration unit on two successive night shift. Moderna’s vaccine has to be stored and shipped frozen but can be stored for 30 days in standard-temperature refrigerators. The statement said the man was generally skeptical of vaccines, and the Moderna vaccine specifically. It said he had shared his beliefs with co-workers for at least the past two years. Intensive care beds for Covid patients in Malaysia have reached full capacity, according to the country’s health director general, who said the country’s pandemic remained at a critical level. Malaysia entered a near total lockdown on 1 June, after daily cases rose to more than 9,000 last month. The increase in cases has been blamed on the more infectious variants of the virus, as well as gatherings held ahead of Eid al-Fitr. Malaysia’s health director general, Noor Hisham Abdullah, said hospitals were facing a rise in severe cases of Covid, especially among older and clinically vulnerable people, who needed oxygen and respiratory assistance. “These patients need a long recovery period to heal, due to serious complications from Covid-19,” he said. The pressure placed on intensive care units, which are at 100% capacity, was very worrying, Noor Hisham said, adding some patients who needed critical care could not be placed in an ICU bed. While new infections have fallen slightly over the past two weeks, there were still 82,797 active cases under treatment and observation as of 8 June. Malaysia managed to contain the virus for much of 2020, and had recorded fewer than 500 fatalities by January. The country’s death toll has since risen to 3,536, while 627,652 cases have been recorded. Hospital morgues have been forced to use containers to cope with the rise in fatalities. Malaysia imposed a national lockdown on 1 June, shutting schools and shopping malls. Only two people from each household are allowed to go out to buy essentials or seek medical treatment within 10km of their home. The manufacturing sector, however, has been allowed to continue operating at a reduced capacity. Malaysia began its vaccination campaign in February, and 7.7% of the population has since received at least one dose Hello and welcome to the continuing coverage of the global pandemic. Here are some of the major developments in the last day. Guangzhou city in China has ordered the closures of cinemas, theatres, nightclubs and other indoor entertainment venues amid an outbreak. The US and the European Union are expected to support a renewed push into investigating the origins of Covid-19 after conflicting assessments about where the outbreak started, according to Bloomberg News. Residents of Melbourne in Australia will come out a tough lockdown on Thursday night, but will still be subject to restrictions including 25km travel limits Washington is also forming working parties with Brussels, Canada, and Mexico to determine how best to safely restart international travel. It came as the World Travel and Tourism Council said the UK government had to scrap its traffic light system for travel because it had “wreaked havoc”. Portugal will allow vaccinated US tourists into the country, Reuters reports. “We are in a position to approve the opening of non-essential travel and flights to people from the US to Portugal as long as they have a vaccination certificate,” economy minister Pedro Siza Vieira, cited by Portuguese radio Renascenca, said. Vaccine passports will be used for the first time at UK sporting events for England’s Euro 2020 group games at Wembley stadium, with those not fully vaccinated able to show proof of a negative lateral flow test taken within the previous 48 hours. World Bank president David Malpass said the institution does not support waiving intellectual property rights for Covid-19 vaccines at the World Trade Organization, claiming it is out of concern that it would hamper innovation in the pharmaceuticals sector. South Africa’s president Cyril Ramaphosa placed the country’s health minister on “special leave” over alleged links to a corruption scandal involving coronavirus communications funding. Pfizer is to begin testing its Covid-19 vaccine on a larger cohort of thousands of children under 12 years old in the US, Finland, Poland and Spain after selecting a lower dose of the shot in an earlier stage of the trial. A top White House official has urged state governors to work with the US Food and Drug Administration to extend the shelf life of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s Covid vaccine as millions of unused doses nationwide near expiration. Many thousands of vaccine doses have been destroyed in African countries after exceeding their expiry dates amid a reluctance to be inoculated and a lack of medical infrastructure, while some jabs were donated relatively late in their shelf life. Music fans flocked to the first unrestricted European festival since the pandemic began over the weekend at an event in Albania that had 10,000 attendees across four days, with everyone showing proof of a recent negative test. Washington state is to give adults a free cannabis spliff after they receive a Covid jab in an attempt to accelerate vaccination uptake through a promotion coined “Joints for Jabs” by the state’s liquor and cannabis board.","charCount":"41061","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a> (now) and <a href=\"profile/helen-davidson\">Helen Davidson</a> (earlier)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2021/jun/09/queensland-covid-update-state-on-alert-after-melbourne-traveller-tests-positive","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-09T10:15:52Z","webTitle":"Queensland and NSW on alert after traveller who left Melbourne lockdown tests positive for Covid","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/jun/09/queensland-covid-update-state-on-alert-after-melbourne-traveller-tests-positive","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2021/jun/09/queensland-covid-update-state-on-alert-after-melbourne-traveller-tests-positive","fields":{"headline":"Queensland and NSW on alert after traveller who left Melbourne lockdown tests positive for Covid","standfirst":"<p>Health authorities say the woman left Melbourne on 1 June and travelled to the Sunshine Coast via NSW</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/jun/09/covid-19-list-queensland-public-exposure-sites-hotspots-brisbane-regional-south-east-qld-sunshine-coast-caloundra-toowoomba-venues-case-location-alerts-metro-coronavirus-cases-outbreak-locations\">Qld Covid hotspots list</a>; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/jun/08/covid-19-list-nsw-public-exposure-sites-hotspots-goulburn-jervis-bay-hyams-beach-gundagai-venues-case-location-alerts-sydney-regional-coronavirus-cases-outbreak-locations\">NSW hotspots</a>; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/jun/09/covid-19-list-melbourne-public-exposure-sites-hotspots-victoria-venues-case-location-alerts-metro-regional-vic-coronavirus-cases-outbreak-locations\">Vic exposure sites</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/jun/08/melbourne-lockdown-covid-victoria-restrictions-coronavirus-rules-covid19-explained-10km-radius-masks-compulsory-exercising-home-gatherings-what-you-need-to-know\">Victoria’s Covid lockdown restrictions explained</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2021/jun/08/covid-19-vaccine-rollout-australia-coronavirus-vaccination-progress-updates-tracker-victoria-nsw-queensland-qld-daily-live-data-stats-updates-total-numbers-distribution-schedule-tracking-new-cases-today\">Covid vaccine rollout numbers: tracking vaccination progress</a></li></ul>","trailText":"Health authorities say the woman left Melbourne on 1 June and travelled to the Sunshine Coast via NSW","byline":"Naaman Zhou","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fc1690b409d238c9f9feab3b963483dad583e787\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc1690b409d238c9f9feab3b963483dad583e787/0_7_4003_2403/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Queensland Covid case: a woman has tested positive after travelling from Melbourne to the Sunshine Coast.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Queensland Covid case: a woman has tested positive after travelling overland from Melbourne to the Sunshine Coast.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Darren England/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Queensland has recorded a local case of Covid-19 after a Melbourne couple left their home city during lockdown and travelled to the Sunshine Coast via New South Wales.</p> <p>A 44-year-old woman from Melbourne tested positive on Wednesday morning in Queensland where she was visiting family.</p> <p>The state’s chief health officer, Dr Jeannette Young, said the woman may have been a recovered case and that further tests were needed.</p> <p>“The CT [cycle threshold] values are quite high so she could well be right at the end of her illness,” Young said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/jun/09/covid-19-list-queensland-public-exposure-sites-hotspots-brisbane-regional-south-east-qld-sunshine-coast-caloundra-toowoomba-venues-case-location-alerts-metro-coronavirus-cases-outbreak-locations\">Queensland Covid-19 exposure sites: list of Qld coronavirus hotspots and case location alerts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The woman and her husband left Melbourne on 1 June, during the state’s recent lockdown.

A 44-year-old woman from Melbourne tested positive on Wednesday morning in Queensland where she was visiting family. The state’s chief health officer, Dr Jeannette Young, said the woman may have been a recovered case and that further tests were needed. “The CT [cycle threshold] values are quite high so she could well be right at the end of her illness,” Young said. The woman and her husband left Melbourne on 1 June, during the state’s recent lockdown. The pair travelled through NSW and arrived in Queensland on 5 June. The woman’s husband has so far tested negative and there are five other identified close contacts. Young said the pair were staying with family in Caloundra. Young said it was too early to discuss whether Queensland would need to enter a lockdown. She said there was no evidence yet of local transmission in Queensland as the woman contracted the virus in Victoria. A police spokesperson told reporters they were investigating how the couple entered Queensland and it was “too early” to say whether they had committed any breaches of health directions. “We will investigate the circumstances of what has happened … all aspects of how that occurred, including what happened in other states,” he said. “It is too early to say. The purpose of our investigation is to establish the facts. That hasn’t happened so we won’t speculate.” On Wednesday, both Queensland and NSW released a list of potential exposures sites related to the couple. In Queensland, the sites included the McDonalds and BP Complex in Goondiwindi on Saturday 5 June; Sunnys at Moffat Beach and Coffee Cat at Kings Beach on Sunday 6 June; various locations at Stockland Caloundra Shopping Centre and Kawana Shoppingworld on Monday 7 June; and the female toilets near the Baringa White’s Supa IGA in Baringa on Tuesday 8 June. In NSW, the sites included the Caltex Narrandera in Gillenbah and the Vandenberg Hotel in Forbes on Tuesday 1 June; the Brew Coffee Bar in Forbes, the Church Street Cafe and Reading Cinemas and Homestead Motel in Dubbo on Wednesday 2 June; and the Gwydir Carpark/Motel and Thermal Pools, Cafe Omega and the Amaroo Tavern in Moree, at various times from Thursday 3 June to Saturday 5 June. More information on these sites and times can be found at Queensland Health and NSW Health. Young said that it was possible the virus would not be able to be genome sequenced due to how long the woman had been infected. “It was quite a late CT value on the test so we aren’t sure we will be able to sequence it,” she said. A cycle threshold value refers to the number of cycles of amplification required for viral RNA to reach a detectable level. The lower the number of cycles needed, the higher the viral load. But Young said it was possible the woman had been infectious during her travel through both NSW and Queensland. “She could well have been infectious while she was travelling through NSW,” she said. Young called on residents of the Sunshine Coast to get vaccinated as soon as possible and she said the federal government had doubled the available vaccines for that region. “Anyone who lives in the Sunshine Coast, this is the time to go forward and get vaccinated,” she said. “GPs will have additional doses of vaccine so anyone who is 50 years of age or older should go to their GP or one of the commonwealth vaccine clinics and get vaccinated.

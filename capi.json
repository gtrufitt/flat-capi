Biden has also been forced to limit his infrastructure bill to $1.7tn, down from his originally proposed $2.2tn initiative. So, the chances of getting GOP support for such a budget are slim. </p> <p>Biden’s two-part initiative to revitalize the US economy is rooted in ramping up its flagging infrastructure and broadening its social safety net. These initiatives would cause the US to have yearly deficits of more than $1.3tn over the next 10 years, with debt increasing to 117% of the value of economic output before 2031.</p> <p>Biden’s plan would be funded, in part, by increasing taxes on corporations and the extremely wealthy. He supports increasing corporate taxes to 28%, up from 21%. All Republicans oppose this tax increase plan, as do some Democrats.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/28/joe-biden-budget-proposal-infrastructure-education-climate\">Biden proposes $6tn budget to boost infrastructure, education and climate</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-05-28T19:30:49.765Z\">at 8.30pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-60b136ca8f086d71cc15dda0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-05-28T18:49:46.856Z\">7.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2021/may/27/joe-biden-republicans-covid-coronavirus-us-politics-latest-updates\">Joe Manchin</a></strong> has slammed GOP senators who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2021/may/28/enate-republicans-capitol-attack-commission-joe-biden-covid-live-updates?page=with:block-60b117128f088d8c3178c299#block-60b117128f088d8c3178c299\">blocked </a>the creation of a bipartisan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2021/may/28/enate-republicans-capitol-attack-commission-joe-biden-covid-live-updates?page=with:block-60b10c8c8f088d8c3178c1d4#block-60b10c8c8f088d8c3178c1d4\">commission </a>to study the deadly Capitol insurrection on 6 January. </p> <p>“Choosing to put politics and political elections above the health of our Democracy is unconscionable, and the betrayal of the oath we each take is something they will have to live with,” Manchin, a Democrat senator from West Virginia, has said.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Sen_JoeManchin/status/1398335147003502592\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Choosing to put politics and political elections above the health of our Democracy is unconscionable.

The speech made the vice-president the first woman to address the academy’s graduating class since its founding in 1845. Harris expressed confidence that the Naval Academy graduates are prepared to meet any challenge they may face in a rapidly changing world. “The American people are depending on you: the best, the bravest, the most brilliant,” the vice-president said. “Class of 2021, you are prepared for all of this. You are prepared for any threat. And you are prepared for this new era.” The Guardian’s Dominic Rushe has the latest on Biden’s $6tn budget proposal Friday: Biden’s budget would fund a dramatic overhaul of US infrastructure, and dedicate extensive funds to education and climate action—which would put government spending at its “highest sustained levels since the second world war,” Rushe explains. Importantly, Rushe points out, Biden’s first budget is “largely a political document.” While this proposal makes clear Biden’s hopes for revitalizing the US in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, Republicans are already chaffing against its scale. Indeed, no Republicans voted in favor of Biden’s $1.9tn Covid stimulus bill. Biden has also been forced to limit his infrastructure bill to $1.7tn, down from his originally proposed $2.2tn initiative. So, the chances of getting GOP support for such a budget are slim. Biden’s two-part initiative to revitalize the US economy is rooted in ramping up its flagging infrastructure and broadening its social safety net. These initiatives would cause the US to have yearly deficits of more than $1.3tn over the next 10 years, with debt increasing to 117% of the value of economic output before 2031. Biden’s plan would be funded, in part, by increasing taxes on corporations and the extremely wealthy. He supports increasing corporate taxes to 28%, up from 21%. All Republicans oppose this tax increase plan, as do some Democrats. Joe Manchin has slammed GOP senators who blocked the creation of a bipartisan commission to study the deadly Capitol insurrection on 6 January. “Choosing to put politics and political elections above the health of our Democracy is unconscionable, and the betrayal of the oath we each take is something they will have to live with,” Manchin, a Democrat senator from West Virginia, has said. “This was our chance to have a bipartisan commission that would allow for an impartial investigation into the events of that horrific day, so that we are better able to prevent another attack on our nation,” Manchin also says. Manchin tells viewers that Democratic leadership in the house and Senate accepted Republicans’ proposed changes “because a commission of this nature must be bipartisan to be successful.” He recognizes the “six brave Republicans” who favored establishing the commission, while pointing out that four more were needed to advance this legislation. Manchin, in his address, has also issued a broad apology about the commission’s failure to progress. “You deserve better, and I am sorry that my Republican colleagues and friends, let political fear prevent them from doing what they know in their hearts to be right.” Joe Biden’s remarks to troops at Joint Base Langley-Eustis have now concluded. Here’s where the day stands so far: Senate Republicans blocked consideration of the bill to form a bipartisan commission to study the Capitol insurrection. The final vote on whether to start debate on the commission bill was 54-35, with six Republicans joining 48 Democrats in supporting the motion to advance the proposal. Democrats needed 60 votes to take up the bill because Republicans invoked the first official Senate filibuster of the Biden era to defeat the legislation. Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer condemned Republicans for preventing the commission bill from moving forward. “Shame on the Republican party for trying to sweep the horrors of that day under the rug because they’re afraid of Donald Trump,” Schumer said in a floor speech shortly after the vote concluded. Biden spoke to US troops to thank them for their service ahead of the Memorial Day holiday. Speaking at the military base in Hampton, Virginia, the president expressed appreciation for the sacrifices made by service members and their families. “Simply stated, you are the backbone of the country,” Biden said. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Joe Biden delivered remarks to US troops at Joint Base Langley-Eustis in Hampton, Virginia, ahead of Memorial Day weekend. The president began his speech with an emotional retelling of how his son, Beau, decided to join the military. Beau Biden died of brain cancer in 2015. Biden said the sacrifices that his son made to join the military reminded him of the sacrifices that service members and their families make every day. “Simply stated, you are the backbone of the country,” Biden said. Jill Biden spoke at Joint Base Langley-Eustis before Joe Biden delivered his own remarks to US troops ahead of the Memorial Day holiday. The first lady, who has made supporting military families a primary focus of her work, expressed appreciation for the sacrifices of service members and their loved ones. “Our military is a community bound together by love,” the first lady said. “It’s time that our nation matches that devotion.” The stage is set at Joint Base Langley-Eustis in Hampton, Virginia, where Joe Biden will soon speak to US troops to thank them for their service ahead of Memorial Day weekend. As the Senate voted on the January 6 commission bill, Joe Biden delivered remarks on the country’s fight against coronavirus in Alexandria, Virginia. Appearing alongside Virginia Governor Ralph Northam, the president celebrated the significant progress that the state has made to limit the spread of coronavirus since he took office in January. Virginia has received more than $247 million in federal funding for community vaccination sites, and more than 1,000 pharmacies across the state have participated in the federal vaccination program. As more Virginians have gotten vaccinated, case numbers have consistently fallen in the state, with deaths and hospitalizations having decreased substantially since January. Although this progress is encouraging, Biden emphasized the importance of getting even more Virginians vaccinated in order to get the virus under control by July 4. “If we succeed, we can celebrate our independence from the virus together on the Fourth of July, as we celebrate our independence as a nation,” Biden said. “And the future is only going to get brighter.” The president and the first lady will also soon deliver remarks in Hampton, Virginia, to kick off the start of Memorial Day weekend, so stay tuned. The Guardian’s Sam Levine reports on the upcoming Senate vote on Democrats’ election reform bill: The senate will vote in about a month on sweeping legislation that would dramatically expand access to the ballot box, Chuck Schumer, the senate majority leader, said Friday. The announcement came immediately after senate Republicans blocked the creation of a bipartisan commission to probe the 6 January attack on the US capitol. Republicans used the filibuster, a procedural tactic that prevents legislation from moving ahead in the senate unless it has 60 votes. The comments from Schumer are significant because there is some handwringing over how exactly Democrats plan to get over the filibuster when it comes to passing the sweeping voting rights bill. Those conversations have become more urgent in recent weeks as Republicans have moved aggressively in state legislatures across the country to impose new restrictions. Schumer said the senate would vote on the bill during the last week of the senate’s June work period. A key senator in the vote will be Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat, who continues to back the filibuster, even as it harms his own party. Manchin has also said he wants bipartisan buy-in for the bill. After the Friday filibuster blocking the 6 January commission, Manchin tweaked Republicans for not supporting the panel. House speaker Nancy Pelosi sharply criticized Senate Republicans for blocking consideration of the January 6 commission bill. “Mitch McConnell asked Senate Republicans to do him a ‘personal favor’ and vote against the January 6th Commission,” the Democratic speaker said in a new statement. “In doing so, Mitch McConnell asked them to be complicit in his undermining of the truth of January 6th. In bowing to McConnell’s personal favor request, Republican Senators surrendered to the January 6th mob assault.” Pelosi argued the vote on the commission bill brought “shame” to the Senate and would make the country less safe. She indicated that House committees, which are under Democratic leadership, would continue to investigate the attack. “Honoring our responsibility to the Congress in which we serve and the Country which we love, Democrats will proceed to find the truth,” Pelosi said. Congresswoman Liz Cheney commended the six Republican senators who voted in favor of taking up the January 6 commission bill. “Thank you to Senators Cassidy, Collins, Murkowski, Portman, Sasse, and Romney for voting for truth and defense of our constitution,” the Republican congresswoman said on Twitter. “History will remember those who put country ahead of politics.” Cheney was ousted as House Republican conference chair earlier this month over her criticism of Donald Trump’s lies about the presidential election, which sparked the Capitol attack. Last week, Cheney voted with 34 other House Republicans and every House Democrat in support of the commission bill. Progressives are already pointing to the Republican blockade of the January 6 commission bill as evidence for why Senate Democrats should eliminate the filibuster. Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Twitter, “If Senate Republicans can block an independent commission investigating a deadly armed attack on the Capitol because it might hurt their poll numbers with insurrectionists, then something is badly wrong with the Senate. We must get rid of the filibuster to protect our democracy.” At least two Senate Democrats -- Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema -- have indicated they are still against eliminating the filibuster. Although Manchin expressed severe disappointment about today’s vote, he previously indicated he would not be willing to end the filibuster to make the commission happen. A spokesperson for Republican Senator Pat Toomey told HuffPost that he was not in Washington for the commission bill vote today because of a family obligation. However, the spokesperson said, Toomey would have voted in favor of starting debate on the bill. The Pennsylvania senator also voted to convict Donald Trump for incitement of insurrection shortly after the Capitol attack, and he had expressed openness to the commission proposal. Toomey’s “aye” vote would have made seven Republicans in support of advancing the bill, but that is still short of 10 Republican votes necessary to overcome the filibuster. Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer condemned his Republican colleagues for blocking consideration of the bill to form a bipartisan commission to study the Capitol insurrection. “Shame on the Republican Party for trying to sweep the horrors of that day under the rug because they’re afraid of Donald Trump,” Schumer said in a floor speech moments ago. This marked Senate Republicans’ first official use of the filibuster to defeat a bill, and Schumer said he hoped this was not the beginning of a trend of Republicans blocking “reasonable, common-sense legislation”. Because Republicans invoked the filibuster, Democrats needed 60 votes to take up the commission bill, and they only got 54 by the time the vote was gaveled out. The six Senate Republicans who voted with Democrats in favor of taking up the January 6 commission bill were Susan Collins, Mitt Romney, Bill Cassidy, Lisa Murkowski, Ben Sasse and Rob Portman. Two Republican senators who voted earlier this year to convict Donald Trump for incitement of insurrection, Pat Toomey and Richard Burr, were not present for the vote. Republicans have successfully blocked the Senate from taking up the bill to form a bipartisan commission to study the Capitol insurrection. The final vote was 54-35, with six Republicans joining 48 Democrats in supporting the motion to advance the bill. Eleven senators did not participate in the vote. Democrats needed 10 of their Republican colleagues to join them in order to break the filibuster and take up the commission bill, but they fell short of that. The January 6 commission is dead -- for now, at least. Senator Joe Manchin told reporters that he was “very disappointed” about the likely defeat of the January 6 commission bill. “Politics has trumped - literally and figuratively - the good of the country,” the Democratic senator said, according to a Wall Street Journal reporter. Republicans will likely be able to defeat the commission bill because of the 60-vote threshold needed to overcome a Senate filibuster. But Manchin has continued to defend the filibuster, saying he is unwilling to eliminate it, even if it means the commission will not happen. Rob Portman of Ohio has become the sixth Republican senator to vote in favor of taking up the January 6 commission bill. Portman voted to acquit Donald Trump in his impeachment trial earlier this year, but the senator acknowledged the former president had “encouraged the mob” to attack the Capitol on January 6. Democrats need four more Republicans to join them in order to overcome a filibuster of the commission bill. Two more Republican senators, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Ben Sasse of Nebraska, have voted in favor of taking up the January 6 commission bill. That makes five Republicans total who have voted with Democrats so far, but it remains unlikely that five more Republicans will join them. Because of the Republican filibuster, 60 votes are needed just to start the Senate debate over the January 6 commission bill. Only three Republicans -- Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Susan Collins of Maine and Mitt Romney of Massachusetts -- have voted in favor of advancing the bill so far. It seems very unlikely that seven more Republicans will join Democrats in voting to take up the bill, so the proposal will almost certainly be defeated. Before the vote began, Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer pleaded with his colleagues to support the January 6 commission bill. “This commission is desperately needed,” the Democratic leader said. “If our Republican friends vote against this, I would ask them: what are you afraid of? The truth?” Schumer argued Donald Trump’s lies about widespread fraud in the presidential election had “eroded” American democracy and the commission was necessary to rebut those lies. “This is not a Democratic or Republican obligation. This is an American obligation,” Schumer said. The Senate is now holding a procedural vote on the bill to create a bipartisan commission to study the Capitol insurrection. The bill is not likely to advance, as only a handful of Republicans have indicated they will support the proposal and Democrats need 60 votes to break a filibuster. The Senate has reached an agreement to delay final consideration of the Endless Frontier Act until after the Memorial Day holiday. The upper chamber will now shift focus to a procedural vote on the bill to form a bipartisan commission to study the Capitol insurrection, as well as votes on two of Joe Biden’s nominees. Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer said moments ago that the commission bill vote will occur sometime in the next hour. Republicans are expected to defeat the bill, as Democrats will need 60 votes to overcome a filibuster of the proposal. The Senate vote on the January 6 commission bill may actually happen sooner rather than later, with a potential deal between Democrats and Republicans in the works. According to multiple reports, Republicans are discussing the possibility of delaying final passage of the Endless Frontier Act until after Memorial Day weekend. If Democrats agree to that, then the Senate will vote on the commission bill and two of Joe Biden’s nominations before leaving for the holiday weekend. However, it’s still unclear if Democrats will be on board, as they wanted to wrap up the Endless Frontier Act before going into recess. Stay tuned. Guardian staff and agencies report: The state-backed Russian cyber spies behind the SolarWinds hacking campaign launched a targeted phishing assault on US and foreign government agencies and thinktanks this week using an email marketing account of the US Agency for International Development (USAid), Microsoft has said. The effort targeted about 3,000 email accounts at more than 150 different organisations, at least a quarter of them involved in international development, humanitarian and human rights work, the Microsoft vice-president Tom Burt wrote in a blog post late on Thursday. It did not say what portion of the attempts may have led to successful intrusions. The cybersecurity firm Volexity, which also tracked the campaign but has less visibility into email systems than Microsoft, said in a post that relatively low detection rates of the phishing emails suggested the attacker was “likely having some success in breaching targets”. Microsoft identified the group carrying out the attacks as Nobelium, originating from Russia and the same actor behind the attacks on SolarWinds customers in 2020. Burt said the campaign appeared to be a continuation of efforts by the Russian hackers to “target government agencies involved in foreign policy as part of intelligence-gathering efforts”. He said the targets spanned at least 24 countries. Another issue as the Senate prepares to vote on the January 6 commission bill: about 10 senators have already left town for Memorial Day weekend, according to Fox News reporter Chad Pergram. Even though the Senate may not be at full attendance today, the number of senators required to break the expected Republican filibuster of the commission bill will not change. So even if only 90 senators are present to vote on the bill later today, 60 votes will still be required to advance the legislation past the filibuster. Republicans are expected to defeat the bill because Democrats need 10 of their colleagues from across the aisle to vote with them to break a filibuster, and that seems extremely unlikely to happen. Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell said he hopes the vote on the January 6 commission bill will happen today, but he did not definitively say whether he thought that would happen. According to CNN, reporters asked McConnell as he entered the Senate how long today’s session will take. “You’ll have to ask the folks who feel compelled to speak,” McConnell replied. Asked if the votes on the Endless Frontier Act and the January 6 commission bill will wrap up today, the Republican leader said, “I hope so, but we will see how it goes.” The Senate had expected to give final approval to the Endless Frontier Act yesterday, but some late-night disagreements pushed that to today. Senator Jon Ossoff did not gavel out the Senate until almost 3 am this morning, and the chamber returned from recess about six hours later. Jill Biden will join Joe Biden when he travels to Europe next month, the White House has just announced. The White House said the first lady will accompany her husband as he attends the G-7 summit in Cornwall from June 11 to 13. “This will be the first overseas travel by President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden,” the White House said. “This trip will highlight the President’s commitment to restoring our alliances, showing that democracies can deliver, and working in close cooperation with our allies and multilateral partners.” CNN reported earlier this week that Biden will meet with Queen Elisabeth II during his trip to the UK, but the White House has not yet confirmed that plan. Kamala Harris is making some history this morning: the vice-president will become the first woman to deliver the commencement address at the US Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. The New York Times reports: The vice president’s speech is expected to focus on some of the Biden administration’s most urgent challenges, like the coronavirus pandemic, climate change and a host of increasingly sophisticated cybersecurity threats. ‘The global pandemic has launched us into a new era. It has forever impacted our world,’ Ms. Harris is expected to say, according to prepared remarks shared with The New York Times. ‘If we weren’t clear before, we know now: Our world is interconnected. Our world is interdependent. Our world is fragile.’ The vice president’s speech at the Naval Academy, in Annapolis, Md., will be her first to focus on the military, and it comes as the Biden administration is accelerating its withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, well ahead of the deadline President Biden set in April: Sept. 11. According to a press pool report, Harris stopped at the gravesite of John McCain before her speech to pay her respects to the late senator and lay some flowers on his headstone. The state of Arizona is preparing to kill death row inmates using hydrogen cyanide, the same lethal gas that was deployed at Auschwitz. Documents obtained by the Guardian reveal that Arizona’s department of corrections has spent more than $2,000 in procuring the ingredients to make cyanide gas. The department bought a solid brick of potassium cyanide in December for $1,530. It also purchased sodium hydroxide pellets and sulfuric acid which are intended to be used to generate the deadly gas. The gas chamber itself, built in 1949 and disused for 22 years, has been dusted off and, according to the department, “refurbished”. Over the past few months the Republican-controlled state has moved aggressively to restart its deeply flawed execution system. The death penalty has been in abeyance in Arizona for seven years following the gruesomely botched lethal injection of Joseph Wood in 2014. Last month, the Guardian revealed that Arizona spent a jaw-dropping $1.5m on a batch of pentobarbital in October, a sedative which it now hopes to use as its main lethal injection method. The Senate is now back in session to wrap up votes on the Endless Frontier Act before holding a vote on the January 6 commission bill. The upper chamber stood in recess for a little over six hours. Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff of Georgia gaveled out the Senate at 2:52 am this morning, per a C-SPAN producer. Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer said in a floor speech moments ago that he expects the chamber to pass the Endless Frontier Act later today. “We have every intention of sticking it out until the job is done, and that’s what we’re going to do,” Schumer said. At least 70% of people charged in the Capitol riot have been released as they wait for trial, according to a Guardian analysis. That high pretrial release rate stands in stark contrast with the usual detention rates in the federal system, where only 25% of defendants nationwide are typically released before their trial. Eric Munchel, known as “Zip Tie Guy”, who was allegedly photographed wearing tactical gear and carrying wrist restraints in the Senate chamber, was released in late March, along with his mother, after an appeals court questioned whether he posed any danger outside the specific context of 6 January. Richard Barnett, the Arkansas man photographed with his foot on Nancy Pelosi’s desk, was released in late April, nearly two months after screaming during a court hearing that “it’s not fair” that he was still in custody when “everybody else who did things much worse are already home”. Multiple alleged members of the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers, two groups facing the most serious conspiracy charges related to their alleged plans for violence, have been released before trial, though some prominent leaders in these groups remain in custody. The disparity in pretrial detention rates highlights what legal experts said was a broader development in the 6 January cases: the likelihood that a substantial swathe of the alleged rioters may not serve any prison time at all, even if they are convicted or plead guilty. Greetings from Washington, live blog readers. The Senate is expected to vote later today on whether to advance the bill to form a bipartisan commission to study the Capitol insurrection – for real this time. The Senate was originally planning to hold a procedural vote on the commission bill yesterday, but some late-night disagreements over the Endless Frontier Act pushed the vote to today. Now the vote is expected to take place later this morning or possibly early this afternoon, according to CNN. Senate Republican leaders seem confident that they have the votes to defeat the bill, which they worry could jeopardize their hopes of taking back Congress in next year’s midterm elections. Senator Lisa Murkowski, one of the few Republicans who is expected to support the commission bill, sharply criticized that logic yesterday. “To be making a decision for the short-term political gain at the expense of understanding and acknowledging what was in front of us on January 6, I think we need to look at that critically. Is that really what this is about, one election cycle after another?” Murkowski told reporters.

Now, Russia’s supreme court has rejected a lawsuit from the <strong>US</strong> company that challenged the Russian government decision to let the firm develop and market the drug without their consent.</p> \n  <p>Reuters reports that the government said in a decree at the time that the move was in the interests of Russia’s own security. According to the decree, Russia had to pay compensation to the drug’s patent-holder. The amount was not specified.<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Vikram Punia</strong>, its director, said the company had also written to Gilead in July last year to try to obtain their consent in the form of a voluntary licence, but had not heard back. Pharmasyntez produces remdesivir under the name <strong>Remdeform</strong>. A shipment of the drug was sent by Russia to India on Tuesday as part of a delivery of humanitarian aid.</p> \n  <p>Gilead said in a statement it was disappointed by the ruling and called the issuance of a compulsory licence “unnecessary and counterproductive ... We have stood ready to work with Russia to expand access to Veklury [remdesevir] since [the] mid-2020.

hopes to permit a staggered return of employees to their offices from August, the government said, with the advice to continue to work from home unless necessary “as strong as ever” until then. Reuters reports: The message is to continue to work from home if at all possible and we anticipate that is going to be the advice until September,” deputy prime minister Leo Varadkar told a news conference. “However we will give consideration, if things continue to improve (in managing Covid-19), to some kind of phased return perhaps in August around people going in on a staggered basis or for training or induction or reasons such as that.” U.S. secretary of state Antony Blinken said at a meeting with India’s foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar that their two countries were united in tackling the Covid-19 pandemic together, Reuters reports. Jaishankar, who has spent the past week in the US seeking help to deal with India’s coronavirus crisis, told reporters while standing with Blinken at the State Department India was grateful to the U.S. administration for strong support and solidarity. Denmark this week began incinerating 4 million mink that had been culled to curb Covid-19 mutations but began to resurface from mass burial sites, prompting renewed health concerns. The government last year decided to cull all of the country’s 17 million mink to curb a coronavirus mutation and because the mammal was considered likely to host future mutations, Reuters reports. Some were buried in pits in a military area in western Denmark under two metres of soil only for some to resurface in less than a month. Contaminants were later found under the graves in an examination carried out on behalf of the Danish Environmental Protection Agency, prompting the government to order the incineration of the the animals. “There’s not supposed to be any virus left, but we burn it at more than 1,000 degrees (Celsius), so if there were any virus left it would definitely disappear,” said Jacob Hartvig Simonsen, the CEO of the ARC waste-management plant. The Taoiseach said the sense of “hope, excitement and relief” is palpable as he confirmed the widespread reopening of Ireland over the summer. Micheal Martin said that while the end of the pandemic is “within our grasp”, he urged the public to “remain vigilant against the terrible virus”, PA reports. As Martin unveiled the government’s plans over June, July and August, he said that the reopening of society and the economy will depend on Irish people following the guidelines in place. Martin confirmed that on June 2, hotels, B&amp;Bs, guesthouses and self-catering accommodation will reopen. On June 7, outdoor services in bars and restaurants will reopen along with cinemas and theatres. On the same date, up to 200 people can attend outdoor events in venues with a minimum capacity of 5000, and up to 100 can attend other outdoor events. In what can only be described as a comedy of errors, an Argentinian TV news channel delivered a stunning, if slightly flawed, scoop when it reported that William Shakespeare, “one of the most important writers in the English language” had died after receiving the Covid vaccine. The mistake of well, Shakespearean, proportions happened on Thursday night after Noelia Novillo, a newsreader on Canal 26 mixed up the Bard with William “Bill” Shakespeare, an 81-year-old Warwickshire man who became the second person in the world to get the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine. William Shakespeare died in 1616, while his namesake – an inpatient in the frailty ward at University hospital, Coventry, at the time of his first vaccination – died this week from a stroke unrelated to the jab. The World Health Organization’s (WHO) top emergency expert Mike Ryan has urged for the separation of the “politics” of the question of the origin of the coronavirus from the science of it, days after US president Joe Biden ordered aides to find answers to the question. “We would like for everyone out there to separate, if they can, the politics of this issue from the science. This whole process is being poisoned by politics,” Ryan said during a press conference, adding further studies are going to be needed to find the origins of the virus. It comes after the last WHO investigating team said a lab leak was “extremely unlikely” and not worthy of further study before the organisation head swiftly said all hypotheses in fact remained under consideration. WHO experts are preparing a proposal on the next studies to be carried out into the origins of the virus that causes Covid-19, The European Medicines Agency (EMA) backed the use of Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine for children as young as 12, paving way for a broader roll-out in the region after similar clearances in the US and Canada. EMA task force chair Marco Cavaleri said that additional reports of blood clots in people after having the AstraZeneca jab since mid-April shows no change in frequency, but the fatality rate has decreased.

A single-shot coronavirus vaccine from Johnson &amp; Johnson was approved for use in the UK. The vaccine, developed by Johnson &amp; Johnson’s pharmaceutical arm Janssen, has been shown to be 67% effective overall at preventing moderate to severe Covid-19, with studies suggesting it also offers complete protection from admission to hospital and death. The World Health Organization called for access to patients in the Gaza strip and free passage to evacuate them for medical treatment as health workers struggle to care for the sick and wounded after 11 days of violence. Indian authorities announced a tentative easing of the lockdown in the capital Delhi as coronavirus infections fall in major cities after weeks of restrictions. Fuelling doubts about whether the Olympics can go ahead safely, Japan’s government has, as expected extended a coronavirus emergency in Tokyo and other parts of the country until just a month before the Games. Lockdown measures in the Netherlands will be eased as of next week, allowing bars and restaurants to serve customers indoors and museums to reopen, Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte said. Hotels in Ireland can reopen on 2 June and pubs and restaurants can resume outdoor service on 7 June, the government announced. All Italians aged over 16 will be able to be vaccinated from 3 June onwards, the government’s Covid-19 commissioner has said, with the country also preparing to extend the campaign to 12 to 15-year-olds. The Greek government unveiled the first EU Covid passport, described by the country’s prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, as a “fast lane to facilitate travel”, after a successful dry run of the technology.

Lockdown measures in the Netherlands will be eased as of next week, allowing bars and restaurants to serve customers indoors and museums to reopen, Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte said. “We are taking another calculated risk”, Rutte said at a news conference. Here’s more on our brief bit earlier, courtesy of Reuters. A total of 316 cases of rare blood clots with low platelets have been recorded in adults who received AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine in the European Economic Area, an executive of the region’s drug regulator said. The figure as of yesterday includes 174 new reports since the European Medicines Agency (EMA) provided an update in April, Georgy Genov, the chief of the watchdog’s safety monitoring operations, said during a briefing today. The EMA has been looking into cases of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) since March and has found a possible link to the vaccine developed with Oxford University, Vaxzevria, and to Johnson &amp; Johnson’s single-dose shot. It has, however, maintained that overall benefits of both the vaccines outweigh any risks posed by them. Genov said a further 19 million people had received the first dose of Vaxzevria in the EEA since the April update, adding that the frequency of TTS has not changed - it is still extremely rare - but the fatality rate following symptoms has decreased. He said the drop in death rates possibly indicated that awareness among those vaccinated and those administering the vaccine and treating patients had gone up, leading to early diagnosis and treatment. France has reported that the number of people in intensive care units with Covid-19 fell by 102 to 3,104 today, while the overall number of people in hospital with the disease fell by 669 to 17,272. Reuters reports that both numbers have been on a strong downward trend in recent weeks. The health ministry also reported 98 new coronavirus deaths in hospitals. Later, it is set to report the death tally for retirement care homes over the past three days as well as data on new cases. The WHO’s European director has warned that the pandemic would not end until at least 70% of people are vaccinated as he criticised Europe’s vaccine rollout as “too slow”. The World Health Organization’s regional director for Europe Hans Kluge said countries and their populations must not become complacent about the pandemic. Don’t think the Covid-19 pandemic is over. The pandemic will be over once we reach 70 percent minimum coverage in vaccination. Our best friend is speed, time is working against us, [and] the vaccination roll-out still goes too slow. We need to accelerate, we need to enlarge the number of vaccines. It is not acceptable that some countries start to vaccinate the younger, healthy part of the population, while other countries in our region still did not cover all the health care workers and the most vulnerable people. In the 53 countries and territories that make up the WHO’s European region, including several in Central Asia, 26% of the population has received a first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine. In the EU, 36.6% of the population has received at least one dose and 16.9% have been fully vaccinated, according to a count by AFP. French president Emmanuel Macron has pledged that his country will invest in boosting the production of Covid-19 vaccines in Africa, to help close a gap in the availability of the shots between African and Western nations. Speaking at a joint news conference with South African president Cyril Ramaphosa in Pretoria, Macron said Africa made up around 20% of the world’s need for vaccines but only 1% of vaccine production. How do we boost the production of vaccines on the African continent? On this, we will this afternoon have an investment strategy to help these industrials produce more, and quite quickly. We need to vaccinate as quickly as possible the maximum number of people ... all over the world. It is our moral duty; it is also in everyone’s interests. He said France already had a partnership with South Africa’s Biovac Institute and would soon launch a project with South African pharmaceutical company Aspen. He reiterated support for waiving intellectual property rights for Covid vaccines, a move also supported by US president Joe Biden but opposed by Germany and the UK among other states. The European Medicines Agency task force chair Marco Cavaleri has said that additional reports of blood clots in people after having the AstraZeneca jab since mid-April shows no change in frequency, but the fatality rate has decreased, according to Reuters. As of yesterday, the EMA had recorded a total of 316 cases of blood clots with low platelets among people who have recently had the AstraZeneca jab in the European Economic Area. Some 17 million people had received at least one dose by 13 April, and since then another 19 million doses have been administered. Hotels in Ireland can reopen on 2 June and pubs and restaurants can resume outdoor service on 7 June, the government has announced. Cinemas and gyms can reopen on 7 June and bars and restaurants can serve customers indoors on 5 July. Non-essential international travel can resume on 19 July in accordance with the EU travel certificate. The announcement heralded a significant easing of one of Europe’s strictest, longest lockdowns. However, Ireland will not restore the Common Travel Area with Britain because of concerns over the Covid-19 variant first identified in India. The government, a coalition comprising Fianna Fail, Fine Gael and the Green party, also approved plans to hold test entertainment and sports events with up to 500 people at outdoor venues. The taoiseach, Micheál Martin, is to outline the plan in a televised address this evening. Everyone arriving in Ireland from abroad, with the exception of Northern Ireland, must complete a passenger locator form and provide evidence of a negative or “not detected” RT-PCR test result. People from countries deemed high-risk – including France and the US – must quarantine in a designated hotel for 14 days. Those from other countries, such as Britain, are advised to self-isolate for 14 days. Travellers going the other way from Ireland to Britain face no such restriction. Ferry companies are urging the Irish government to fully reinstate the Common Travel Area and open a de facto “bubble” with British travellers. The Biden administration is taking “a very close look” at the possibility of vaccine passports for travel into and out of the US, the homeland security secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said today. Like so many other public health measures meant to mitigate Covid-19’s spread, vaccine passports have drawn support and ire. Some welcome the fast pass to normalcy, sick of extended quarantines and tedious testing requirements. Others harbour unsubstantiated concerns that the certificates could chip away at their privacy. Still others worry about vaccine inequality, with the life-saving shots going disproportionately to residents of the world’s wealthiest nations. Vaccine equity campaigners have said it would be “obscene” to allow Johnson &amp; Johnson to put company profits before people’s lives, as their vaccine is approved for use in the UK. Global Justice Now, part of the People’s Vaccine Alliance, is calling on the company to share its vaccine technology and know-how through the World Health Organisation’s Covid-19 technology access pool (C-TAP). The group’s director, who was a trial volunteer for the company’s vaccine, has said he and his fellow volunteers wanted “a people’s vaccine”. Nick Dearden, director of Global Justice Now, said: A single-dose vaccine has huge advantages and could be easier to roll out in low and middle income countries, but we won’t be able to fully utilise this vaccine unless Janssen shares its patents and technological knowhow with the world. NHS staff and trial volunteers like myself poured time and resources into this vaccine. Governments and charities have fronted billions of dollars to make it a reality. The only return we wanted was a vaccine for the world – a people’s vaccine. This is an unprecedented pandemic. Johnson &amp; Johnson is one of the wealthiest companies in the world. We need to put people’s lives before this company’s profits. Anything less would be obscene.” Earlier this month, 450 academics, public health experts, charities, NGOs, unions, MPs, peers, faith leaders, doctors, and patients wrote to Boris Johnson, calling for the UK to support an intellectual property waiver on Covid-19 vaccines and treatments. The UK has today reported 4,182 new cases of Covid-19, up from 3,542 yesterday, and 10 new deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test. The official data showed 38.87 million people had received their first dose of the vaccine, equivalent to 73.8% of the total adult population. The government also said that, as of 9am today, there had been a further 4,182 lab-confirmed cases in the UK. It brings the cumulative total to 4,477,705. That’s it from me, Rhi Storer, for now. I will now hand over the live blog back to Mattha Busby for the rest of the afternoon. Here’s what we know about the European’s Medicines Agency (EMA) approval of the Pfizer vaccine on children: It will be expanded to children ages 12 to 15, a decision that offers younger and less at-risk populations across the continent access to a coronavirus vaccine for the first time during the pandemic. The recommendation follows similar decisions by regulators in Canada and the US last month. The EMA’s recommendation that the vaccine can safely be used on adolescents was based on a study of more than 2,000 adolescents in the U.S. that showed the vaccine was safe and effective. Researchers will continue to monitor the shot’s long-term protection and safety in the children for another two years. Marco Cavaleri, who heads the EMA body, said the European Union regulator had received the necessary data to authorise the vaccine for adolescents and found it to be highly effective against coronavirus. The decision will need to be rubber-stamped by the European Commission and individual national regulators, he said. Breaking news coming in via Reuters, as the European Medicines Agency backs the use of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine for children as young as 12, paving way for a broader roll-out in the region after similar clearances in the US and Canada. The European Medicines Agency’s endorsement comes weeks after it began evaluating extending use of the vaccine, developed with Germany’s BioNTech, to include 12- to 15-year olds. It is already being used in the European Union for those aged 16 and older. This story will be updated as more details emerge. Over in Vietnam, the health ministry is in talks to secure COVID-19 vaccines from Moderna through its distribution partner in Asia, Zuellig Pharma, as the country battles a new outbreak. Health minister Nguyen Thanh Long asked Zuellig Pharma to supply Moderna vaccines to Vietnam as soon as possible so the country can cope with the pandemic effectively, Vietnam’s health ministry said in a statement on Friday. After successfully containing the new coronavirus for most of last year, Vietnam is now battling an outbreak which includes the highly transmissible B.1.1.7 variant and B.1.617.2 variant. The country has placed orders for vaccines from several suppliers and has received around 2.9 million doses from its purchases and via the international COVAX scheme. Vietnam has registered 6,396 coronavirus cases so faf, half of which were recorded in the latest outbreak. At least 1.04 million people in Vietnam have had one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, but only 28,529 have been fully vaccinated, according to official data. A quick news story from Reuters as Russia declines to approve combined AstraZeneca and Sputnik V vaccine trials. The Russian health ministry has declined to approve clinical trials in Russia of a vaccine against COVID-19 combining Russia’s Sputnik V and AstraZeneca’s shots, an AstraZeneca official told Reuters on Friday. Human trials of a COVID-19 vaccine combining a shot from AstraZeneca and Britain’s Oxford University with Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine were approved in Azerbaijan, the United Arab Emirates and Belarus, said Irina Panarina, AstraZeneca general director in Russia and Eurasia. She said AstraZeneca was preparing a response to questions from Russia’s health ministry. Japan has extended its coronavirus state of emergency in Tokyo and other areas for 20 more days, with infections still not slowing as it prepares to host the Olympics. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said: “I am aware that many people are voicing concern about holding the Olympics and Paralympics. “I take them seriously, and I will proceed with preparations for a safe and secure games.” He said the next three weeks are “an extremely important time for us to achieve results” in a two-pronged battle to control infections while expanding vaccinations. The state of emergency, covering Tokyo and eight other metropolitan areas, was expected to end next Monday, but hospitals in some areas are still overflowing with coronavirus patients and serious cases have recently hit new highs. The 20-day extension covers nine areas ranging from Hokkaido in the north to Fukuoka in the south. A 10th area, the southern island prefecture of Okinawa, is already under emergency status through June 20. The Olympics are scheduled to start July 23, after a one-year postponement due to the pandemic. Worries about new variants and Japan’s slow vaccination rollout have triggered calls from the public, medical experts and even a sponsor to cancel the games. Only 2.3% of the population has been fully vaccinated. Japan has reported about 730,000 coronavirus cases and more than 12,700 deaths.

All Italians aged over 16 will be able to be vaccinated from 3 June onwards, the government’s Covid-19 commissioner has said, with the country also preparing to extend the campaign to 12 to 15-year-olds. Reuters has more: Prime minister Mario Draghi has so far urged regional health authorities to give priority to the elderly, who are especially vulnerable to the disease. “From 3 June, all regions will be able to open up to all age groups [over 16],” commissioner Francesco Paolo Figliuolo said. Some 11.2 million Italians, or 19% of the population, have completed their vaccination cycle as of Friday, while more than 20 million people have received a first shot. The country has registered more than 125,000 coronavirus deaths so far, the second highest toll in Europe after Britain. With many more vaccinations starting to arrive from the various manufacturers, the government is looking to ramp up its inoculation campaign with the aim of covering the entire adult population by September. Figliuolo said vaccinations might soon be opened up to some 2.3 million Italians aged between 12 and 15 if the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and Italian regulators give the green light. The EMA is expected to approve shots for youngsters later today. “We are ready to vaccinate them,” Figliuolo said. World Health Organization (WHO) experts are preparing a proposal on the next studies to be carried out into the origins of the virus that causes Covid-19, a spokeswoman has said. The US called yesterday for the WHO to carry out a second phase of its investigation into the origins, with independent experts given full access to original data and samples in China. The UK made a similar appeal. WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib told a UN briefing today that experts would prepare a proposal for WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, but that there was no set timeline. Earlier this week WHO’s top emergency expert Mike Ryan said that talks with member states would continue in coming weeks. Illustrating the potential dangers of social media regulation of news content, due to its u-turn, Facebook yesterday lifted a ban on posts claiming Covid-19 was man-made after the Wall Street Journal reported that three staff members at the Wuhan Institute for Virology sought hospital treatment for flu-like symptoms in November 2019. It comes after Adhanom Ghebreyesus in February almost immediately undermined the dismissal by a WHO team that visited Wuhan to investigate the origins of the pandemic of the lab leak theory. The original mission oversaw tens of thousands of tests on animals which did not make any suggestion there was a natural cause to the virus. Prince Charles has suggested that people struggling to return to full health after having the coronavirus should practise yoga. In a video statement to the virtual yoga and healthcare symposium Wellness After Covid, the heir apparent said doctors should work together with “complementary healthcare specialists” to “build a roadmap to hope and healing” after Covid. This pandemic has emphasised the importance of preparedness, resilience and the need for an approach which addresses the health and welfare of the whole person as part of society, and which does not merely focus on the symptoms alone. As part of that approach, therapeutic, evidenced-informed yoga can contribute to health and healing. By its very nature, yoga is an accessible practice which provides practitioners with ways to manage stress, build resilience and promote healing.” The prince said those attending the symposium shared an ambition “to help those for whom the mental anguish and physical challenges of long Covid have been devastating”. He added: “When we work together with a common interest we can build on each other’s ideas and, perhaps, build a roadmap to hope and healing.” Speaking to attendees at the event co-organised by the Yoga In Healthcare Alliance and the Give Back Yoga university, the Prince of Wales also acknowledged his own brush with Covid in March last year, saying: “I seem to have got away with it quite lightly … unfortunately, that is not the case for millions of people in the UK and across the globe.” Travelers coming from Nordic countries will no longer have to show a negative Covid test to enter Sweden from next week, the minister for the interior has said. “We have decided to go ahead with the Nordics first, it’s a priority for us,” the minister, Mikael Damberg, said. Travelers from other countries within the EU will still have to show a negative test until 30 June, Reuters reports. Travelers from outside the EU are still banned. Thirty-two members of parliament in the Democratic Republic of Congo, or about 5% of the total, have died from Covid-19 since the start of the pandemic, the vice-president of the national assembly said. Reuters has the story: Even as Congo, like many other African countries, has officially reported relatively few cases and deaths, the virus has rippled through the corridors of power, killing prominent lawmakers and members of the president’s entourage. “The latest update announced by the government reports 31,248 confirmed cases and 780 deaths, among them 32 members of parliament,” said Jean-Marc Kabund, the first vice president of the lower house of parliament. In December, lawmakers and others in the parliament building flung chairs and buckets at one another during a brawl caused by a rift between president Felix Tshisekedi and his predecessor, Joseph Kabila. Most wore their masks below their chins. Tshisekedi raised eyebrows earlier this month when, during a dinner with supporters in the southeastern city of Kolwezi, he noted jokingly that attendees were violating a curfew imposed in response to the pandemic and said, “Today, you have permission.” Congo’s vaccination campaign has stuttered after it delayed the rollout because of safety concerns about the AstraZeneca shot. As a result, around 75% of the 1.7 million doses it received in March were reallocated the following month to make sure they were used before they expired. Indian authorities have announced a tentative easing of the lockdown in the capital Delhi as coronavirus infections fall in major cities after weeks of restrictions. AFP reports: Rural areas of the country are now seeing the brunt of a surge in cases that has overwhelmed the health care system and killed at least 160,000 people since the start of March. Arvind Kejriwal, Delhi’s chief minister, said that from Monday construction work and factories can resume, “keeping the poorest section of our society, the labourers and daily wage workers, in mind”. “We are starting the process of reopening very, very slowly. We will reassess it after a week based on experts and people’s opinions,” he said. Daily infections reported across India have more than halved from more than 400,000 earlier this month, according to official statistics. Deaths per day have also fallen but by much less, with 3,660 reported on Friday in the previous 24 hours. This is widely seen as a major underestimate. Delhi reported about 1,100 new infections today, down from about 25,000 daily cases when the lockdown was announced six weeks earlier. Even as he announced reopening from Monday, Kejriwal urged people of Delhi to “not step out of your homes unnecessarily”. He said: “This is a very sensitive time and we have to function with full responsibility so that we can together save our Delhi and our country.” A single-shot coronavirus vaccine from Johnson &amp; Johnson has been approved for use in the UK. PA Media reports: The vaccine, developed by Johnson &amp; Johnson’s pharmaceutical arm Janssen, has been shown to be 67% effective overall at preventing moderate to severe Covid-19, with studies suggesting it also offers complete protection from admission to hospital and death. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, welcomed the news. He said: “This is a further boost to the UK’s hugely successful vaccination programme, which has already saved over 13,000 lives, and means that we now have four safe and effective vaccines approved to help protect people from this awful virus. “As Janssen is a single-dose vaccine, it will play an important role in the months to come as we redouble our efforts to encourage everyone to get their jabs and potentially begin a booster programme later this year.” The Danish government has presented its digital coronavirus passport enabling people to travel abroad or, in Denmark, go to the hairdresser, a tattoo parlour, dine inside a restaurant or wherever else it is needed. “The corona passport we present today can be used from 1 July when you can travel within the EU,” said finance minister Nicolai Vammen. AP has the story: Some 20% of Denmark’s population of 6 million have been fully vaccinated, according to the latest figures, he said. During a press conference outside the Copenhagen airport, health minister Magnus Heunicke held up his phone to show the app, which only features a QR code and a green bar if the person has been vaccinated twice or recently tested negative for Covid-19. “What we get now is an app that makes it easier and simpler to use,” Heunicke said. “There is no doubt that we will have to use it over the summer, but it is of course something that needs to be phased out.” People will either have the code scanned or will flash it before entering an airport, a harbor, a train station, a hairdresser or an eatery. In certain cases, a physical document can be sent in the mail to serve the same purpose as the app. However, there have been warnings from across Europe that vaccine certificates could create a form of “medical apartheid”. Last month, more than 1,200 church leaders in the UK said in a letter they are an “unethical form of coercion” and would strengthen the “surveillance state”. This scheme has the potential to bring about the end of liberal democracy as we know it and to create a surveillance state in which the government uses technology to control certain aspects of citizens’ lives. As such, this constitutes one of the most dangerous policy proposals ever to be made in the history of British politics. Holland’s first choice goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen has tested positive for coronavirus and will not travel with the team for a week-long European Championship training camp in Portugal. The Valencia keeper will miss the preparations on the Algarve, which include a friendly international against Scotland on Wednesday. “The medical staff of the Dutch team are monitoring his condition closely and as soon as it is medical responsible, he will be drafted back into the squad,” a statement from the Dutch football association said. Marco Bizot, who was not named in the final 26-man squad by coach Frank de Boer, was already scheduled to travel to the camp in Portugal as a standby keeper, so no replacement is necessary, Reuters reports. Hungary has identified two cases of the coronavirus variant first detected in India, the government official in charge of vaccinations has said. Reuters reports: The central European country has been badly hit by the pandemic, and according to Johns Hopkins University data is the country with the most deaths per 100,000 people. An especially lethal third wave has been easing after an aggressive vaccination campaign. “The Indian variant is present in Hungary, according to experts we cannot exclude the possibility of a new wave of the pandemic,” Istvan Gyorgy, deputy minister and head of the government’s task force on vaccinations, told a news conference. Surgeon General Cecilia Muller added one of the two patients has recovered already. Contact tracing was unable to establish how they were infected. Neither of them spent time abroad recently. The World Health Organization has called for access to patients in the Gaza strip and free passage to evacuate them for medical treatment as health workers struggle to care for the sick and wounded after 11 days of violence. Reuters reports: WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib told a Geneva briefing that around 600 patients, including some with chronic conditions, needed to be referred outside of the Palestinian enclave since the start of the hostilities, but had been unable to due to crossing closures. “It’s very important that we help Palestinians get the care they need, especially helping them get treatment outside the Gaza strip,” she said. WHO has a presence on the ground, Chaib said, but was unable to confirm whether it currently had any access from the outside. Other aid agencies have complained about limited humanitarian access and drug supplies. Dozens of health centres were damaged during Israeli bombings earlier this month, prompting the WHO to warn that facilities risked being overwhelmed. “The capacity of the health system to respond is completely crushed,” Helen Ottens-Patterson, MSF head of mission in Gaza, told journalists earlier this week. In an indication of the challenges ahead, she said that an MSF team had to “wade through rubble and glass” to access a ministry of health compound earlier this week. AFP have this dispatch from Finland as the Scandinavian country opens drive-in voting for local elections on 13 June to manage the risk of Covid transmissions at traditional polling stations. Cars are queued up on an old airport runway on the outskirts of the Finnish capital Helsinki - not for coronavirus tests but for drivers to cast their vote. Outdoor polling stations have sprung up across the Nordic country as authorities try to make voting as socially distanced as possible ahead of the country’s local elections. “Signing in and filling out the ballot paper went brilliantly,” retiree Joukko Salminen tells AFP from inside his white car. “And corona safe too!” Finland’s municipal vote was due to take place in April but was postponed due to the pandemic, after which officials began looking for ways to cast ballots outside during a two-week advance voting period, while protecting the legally protected privacy of voters. “We’ve built screens that stop people being able to see the voting happening,” polling station manager Vesa Kouvonkorpi said. “Because the car is the polling booth, and by law you’re not allowed to see into the polling booth.” Although processing the drive-in votes takes about four times as long as the regular process, the outdoor polling station has proven popular and received 500 voters on its first day, Kouvonkorpi says. Mexico has administered roughly 27.7m doses – about 10.9% of the population – and president Andrés Manuel López Obrador has expressed hopes all adults will have had at least one dose by October. But vaccines have still been denied to many doctors, dentists and medical workers in private medicine – and also some physicians in public institutions. More health workers have died during the pandemic in Mexico than any other country in the hemisphere, according to the Pan-American Health Organisation. Fuelling doubts about whether the Olympics can go ahead safely, Japan’s government has, as expected extended a coronavirus emergency in Tokyo and other parts of the country until just a month before the Games. Organisers said they would now wait to take a decision on whether to allow local fans at the Games until the period ends on 20 June. AFP reports that fans from overseas have already been barred, in an unprecedented decision. Japan has seen a comparatively small virus outbreak, with around 12,500 deaths, and has avoided tough lockdowns. But a fourth wave has prompted the government to put emergency measures in place in 10 regions including the capital. The measures mostly limit the sale of alcohol in bars and restaurants and ask them to close early, while encouraging telework and capping audience numbers at events. “The number of new cases has been declining since the middle of the month but the situation continues to be uncertain,” said prime minister Yoshihide Suga, announcing the extension. Tokyo 2020 chief Seiko Hashimoto told reporters that with the measures being taken “we expect the infection situation to improve.” But she acknowledged that a decision on local fans, originally expected in early June, would now not be taken until the end of the month. “Once the state of emergency is lifted, we will assess how many spectators we can allow in,” she said, adding that there could be different rules for indoor and outdoor venues and the decision would be based on government guidelines. Even under the current state of emergency, sports venues in Japan are allowed to seat 5,000 spectators or 50 percent capacity, whichever is smallest. As pharmaceutical companies face growing pressure to waive patents to allow Covid vaccines to be manufactured quicker to allow more even distribution around the globe, Russia has provided an interesting model on what to do if you would like a certain medicine to be available in your country. Late last year, the Russian government granted Russian drugmaker Pharmasyntez a compulsory licence for one year to manufacture the anti-Covid-19 drug remdesivir under a different name without creator Gilead Science’s permission. Pharmasyntez had asked the Kremlin to allow it to produce a generic version of remdesivir before the decree was issued. Now, Russia’s supreme court has rejected a lawsuit from the US company that challenged the Russian government decision to let the firm develop and market the drug without their consent. Reuters reports that the government said in a decree at the time that the move was in the interests of Russia’s own security. According to the decree, Russia had to pay compensation to the drug’s patent-holder. The amount was not specified. Vikram Punia, its director, said the company had also written to Gilead in July last year to try to obtain their consent in the form of a voluntary licence, but had not heard back. Pharmasyntez produces remdesivir under the name Remdeform. A shipment of the drug was sent by Russia to India on Tuesday as part of a delivery of humanitarian aid. Gilead said in a statement it was disappointed by the ruling and called the issuance of a compulsory licence “unnecessary and counterproductive ... We have stood ready to work with Russia to expand access to Veklury [remdesevir] since [the] mid-2020. Intellectual property is not, and has never been, a significant barrier to access to medicines in Russia.” Its Mattha Busby here taking over the blog from my colleague Martin Belam. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening to everyone reading, do get in touch via Twitter with any thoughts or tips. Stay tuned for updates. Greece has said it is ready to use a Covid-19 travel certificate before its EU-wide launch on 1 July to attract foreign travellers and save its tourism sector from a second summer lost to the coronavirus. Spain’s prime minister Pedro Sanchez also confirmed his country would take part in the trials from 7 June. “This will be decisive in getting the certificate ready before summer begins and is big news for our tourism industry.” The deputy prime minister of Ireland, Leo Varadkar, has said that Irish citizens should be able move more freely across the European Union from mid-July, but cast doubt on whether it would also apply to Britain. South Africa is in a race against time to vaccinate as many people as possible amid signs the virus may be surging again with the approach of winter in the southern hemisphere, when people spend more time indoors, typically allowing for more spread of disease. Japan is expected to extend emergency coronavirus measures in Tokyo and several other regions by about three weeks, according to officials, as the country struggles to rein in a fourth wave of infections less than two months before the Olympics. Japan said it would consider sharing its Covid vaccines with other countries as a ruling party committee urged it to provide a portion of its AstraZeneca vaccine stock to Taiwan. Japan has also today approved the use of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine for those aged 12 and above. Weeks into Taiwan’s worst outbreak since the pandemic began, and 10 days after the island was put on the third highest level of social restrictions, daily totals of new cases are still not decreasing, the health minister has conceded. India reported on Friday 186,364 new coronavirus infections during the previous 24 hours, for its lowest daily rise since April 14, while deaths rose by 3,660. The south Asia region - India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Bhutan, Nepal, Maldives and Sri Lanka – accounts for 18% of global cases and almost 10% of deaths according to analysis by Reuters. The region has exceeded 30 million cases in total. Australia’s government is scrambling to administer first doses of Covid vaccines to unvaccinated aged care homes across Victoria on the first day of a week-long lockdown. Overcrowding in Victoria’s healthcare system is a “bigger public health emergency than Covid”, according to a leading emergency physician who says the state’s doctors and nurses were exhausted even before the latest outbreak in Australia. Czech restaurants will open to indoor diners from Monday. The Czech Republic will also open up to tourists from seven countries – Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia, Croatia, Austria and Germany – under reciprocal agreements. A €2.5bn (£2.15bn) package has been agreed by Germany’s government to help the culture industry get back on its feet as the country slowly emerges from a third wave of the Covid pandemic. The UK business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, has defended health secretary Matt Hancock against criticism that he failed to protect people in care homes at the outset of the Covid pandemic, saying residents “were protected as far as we could”. Professor Christina Pagel, from University College London and a member of Independent Sage, said the India variant was causing concern in England and the road map for reopening the economy should be delayed. Murdo Fraser of the Scottish Conservatives has criticised the continued restrictions in place across Glasgow. He has said if the latest data shows infections are still high then a “more targeted” approach was needed in Scotland. A royal academy chaired by Princess Chulabhorn, the youngest sibling of Thailand’s king, has said it would import 1 million doses of Sinopharm’s Covid-19 vaccine next month, after the Food and Drug Administration authorised its use. The Philippines has suspended the deployment of workers to Saudi Arabia after it received reports that their employers and recruiters were making them pay for Covid-19 testing, quarantine and insurance upon arrival in the kingdom. Russia has registered the world’s first vaccine for animals against Covid, its agricultural regulator said on Wednesday, after tests showed it generated antibodies against the virus in dogs, cats, foxes and mink Health ministers around the world are being urged to sign off on plans to create 6m more nursing jobs by 2030, amid warnings that Covid-19 has exacerbated a global shortage and could spark a “brain drain” from the developing world. That’s it from me, Martin Belam. I will be back on Tuesday. Harry Taylor has our UK live blog, Mattha Busby will be joining you here shortly to carry on bringing you the latest global Covid developments. The Philippines has suspended the deployment of workers to Saudi Arabia after it received reports that their employers and recruiters were making them pay for Covid-19 testing, quarantine and insurance upon arrival in the kingdom. Reuters report that Labour secretary Silvestre Bello said in an order that his department will issue an official statement on resumption of deployment “after this matter has been clarified accordingly”. It was not immediately clear how many Filipinos bound for Saudi Arabia would be directly affected. Saudi Arabia was the most preferred destination of overseas Filipino workers in 2019, government data showed, hosting one out of five Filipinos who landed jobs abroad during that year. The Scott Morrison government in Australia was scrambling to administer first doses of Covid vaccines to unvaccinated aged care homes across Victoria on the first day of a week-long lockdown, as federal ministers rejected criticism of the programme’s rollout. Facilities hurriedly prepared residents for rushed vaccines on Friday as the commonwealth raced to vaccinate neglected populations within the highest priority group it had initially promised to two months ago. The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, had said on Thursday there were 74 residential aged care homes across Australia that had not yet received an initial dose of Covid vaccine, including 16 in Victoria. But he went on a media blitz on Friday morning insisting every aged care home in the state would have received at least one dose by the weekend. The government’s push to vaccinate the remaining aged care homes in Victoria came a day after Hunt announced the recommended two-week interval between flu and Covid shots would be scrapped for aged care settings in Victoria. The operator of one aged care home in Melbourne, who asked not to be identified, told Guardian Australia they were surprised to learn vaccination teams were being sent to their facility on Friday. It presented logistical hurdles to prepare residents at such short notice, they said. Read more here: Federal government scrambles to vaccinate Victorian aged care homes as state enters first day of lockdown My colleague Haroon Siddique has a fuller write-up of those quotes from the UK business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng that we were carrying on this blog earlier: Kwasi Kwarteng defends Hancock over Covid care home claims As a reminder, UK Covid news is now being blogged by Harry Taylor over here: A royal academy chaired by Princess Chulabhorn, the youngest sibling of Thailand’s king, has said it would import 1m doses of Sinopharm’s Covid-19 vaccine next month, after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorised its use. The announcement in the official Royal Gazette surprised some members of the government, which had until now insisted on being the sole importer of Covid-19 vaccines. The FDA on Friday approved the Sinopharm coronavirus vaccine for emergency use, making it the fifth authorised by Thailand after AstraZenaca, Sinovac’s CoronaVac, Johnson &amp; Johnson’s Janssen and Moderna “We want to help plug in the gaps for business, schools, so they can move forward,” Nithi Mahanonda, secretarygeneral of the Chulabhorn Royal Academy told a news briefing. Reuters report that earlier this week, the academy announced it would import “alternative vaccines” to supplement the government campaign. The government says it will have 6m AstraZenaca doses and 3 million Sinovac doses available in June. Just over 1 million of Thailand’s more than 66 million people are fully vaccinated. Nithi said other organisations would be able to buy from the academy’s 1m Sinopharm doses, adding that it did not seek profit. Greece has said it is ready to use a Covid-19 travel certificate before its EU-wide launch on 1 July to attract foreign travellers and save its tourism sector from a second summer lost to the coronavirus. The free certificate will take the form of a QR code on a smartphone or paper, letting authorities determine the status of a visitor based on records in their home EU country. Greece was one of the early advocates of a certificate that would ease European Union travel curbs and help pull the country’s economy from recession by lifting tourism revenues. The European Council and parliament last week reached a deal on the digital green certificate following a rapid pick-up of vaccinations allowing widespread lifting of coronavirus curbs. The European parliament is expected to pass a law in the week from 7 June and more than a dozen EU countries, including France and Spain, have agreed to test the system before a launch on 1 July. The certificate would show if a person had received a vaccine, had a recent negative test or had immunity based on recovery. “It is very, very simple. Essentially, it includes all the information that a member-state would need to welcome a traveller without imposing additional restrictions,” Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said at a presentation of the pass on Friday. Lefteris Papadimas and Angeliki Koutantou report for Reuters that Mitsotakis added: “Greece is ready to launch this digital certificate earlier than 1 July.” He called on EU countries to ensure they stick to the deadlines and facilitate travel over the summer. In a separate event in the northern Spanish city of Soria, Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez also confirmed his country would take part in the trials from 7 June. “This will be decisive in getting the certificate ready before summer begins and is big news for our tourism industry.” South Africa is in a race against time to vaccinate as many people as possible amid signs the virus may be surging again with the approach of winter in the southern hemisphere, when people spend more time indoors, typically allowing for more spread of disease. It is also a critical front in the fight against the virus in Africa, with South Africa recording 40% of the continent’s Covid-19 deaths. Since January, South Africa has vaccinated nearly 500,000 of its 1.2 million healthcare workers and now is adding its older citizens to the campaign. In the past two weeks, nearly 200,000 have received their Pfizer jabs with instructions to come back in six weeks to get their second dose. After a plateau of the disease that lasted a few months, South Africa’s new cases, hospitalisations and deaths are trending up. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases has risen over the past two weeks from 3.33 per 100,000 people on 12 May to 3.97 per 100,000 on Wednesday, according to Johns Hopkins University. The seven-day rolling average of deaths is also on the rise: from 0.10 deaths per 100,000 people to 0.11 per 100,000 over the same period. The increase may seem small, but experts warn it may be the start of a resurgence as the country enters the colder winter months, which start in June. The national coronavirus task force met this week and President Cyril Ramaphosa’s government is pondering the possibility of reimposing restrictions, such as reducing the hours that alcohol can be sold and limiting the number of people at gatherings. “We’re under pressure to reach higher levels of vaccination,” Mosa Moshabela, professor of public health at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, told the Associated Press. “New vaccination centers are opening every day and the numbers being given shots should quickly go from 20,000 elderly per day to 50,000 and then 100,000 per day,” he said. “By June we should reach 200,000 per day. We need to have that kind of volume to get close to vaccinating 5 million elderly by the end of June.” South Africa’s overall goal is to vaccinate 67% of its 60 million people by February. Czech restaurants will open to indoor diners from Monday, health minister Adam Vojtech said this morning, announcing a quicker-than-planned easing of Covid-19 restrictions. Reuters report that the Czech Republic will also open up to tourists from seven countries – Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia, Croatia, Austria and Germany – under reciprocal agreements. Harry Taylor is on our UK live blog duties this morning, and he’s just got that started for the day. If you are after UK news, then you can follow that with him here … I’ll be continuing here with the latest global coronavirus news. The deputy prime minister of Ireland, Leo Varadkar, has said that Irish citizens should be able move more freely across the European Union from mid-July, but cast doubt on whether it would also apply to Britain. “The advice that we have, and we’re accepting this advice, is that there are real concerns about the Indian variant and for that reason, we’re not in a position to restore the common travel area just yet,” Varadkar told national broadcaster RTE. Reuters report he said there would continue to be restrictions for arrivals from Britain, including requirements to have a vaccine or a negative Covid-19 test, even once travel opens up using the EU’s “green certificate”. Very quick snap from Reuters that a Japanese health ministry panel has approved the use of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine for those aged 12 and above. The move, which lowers the threshold from 16, follows approvals in the US and other nations this month for the vaccine to be used for adolescents. On the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, UK business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng was pushed on the issue of people being discharged from hospital to care homes without testing. He was fairly steadfast in repeatedly saying that testing capacity had to be built from scratch, and that is what Matt Hancock and the department did. Weeks into Taiwan’s worst outbreak since the pandemic began, and 10 days after the island was put on the third highest level of social restrictions, daily totals of new cases are still not decreasing, the health minister has conceded. In today’s daily press conference, minister Chen Chih-shung reported 19 new deaths, 297 new cases and an additional 258 cases from a backlog of cases stretching as far as 10 days. He said the trends appeared stable, and were not rising, but the fact they were not visibly decreasing suggested there was still unidentified spread. The 19 deaths is the third consecutive record for daily fatalities. Taiwan is currently on alert level 3, of a four-tier system. Recreation, entertainment and sporting venues have closed, restaurants ordered to do take-away only, and working from home encouraged but not enforced. The backlog of cases has made assessment of trends - and the effectiveness of the response measures - difficult, with up to 95 cases at a time being added to previous daily totals. For the first time in this outbreak, Chen has flagged a possible move to level 4, requiring a lockdown. Until now he has said it would not happen unless there were 14 consecutive days of more than 100 cases (which has happened) and a rate of at least 50% untraced (which has not happened). He said they need to get a clearer picture of the trends, and would have more information early next week. Chen also announced local governments would be allowed to facilitate their own vaccine purchases, with FDA approval, acknowledging the central government’s processes were not procuring fast enough to meet Taiwan’s needs in the context of the current outbreak. About 330,000 people have received at least one vaccine so far, from a population of 24 million. Taiwan’s hospitals have also been told to double their Covid patient capacity by allowing two patients to a room, instead of one. A €2.5bn (£2.15bn) package has been agreed by the German government to help the culture industry get back on its feet as the country slowly emerges from a third wave of the Covid pandemic. The finance minister, Olaf Scholz, has called the package “the biggest cultural subsidy programme” since the end of the second world war. The coronavirus cultural fund is intended to give organisers of events assurances that they will be compensated if performances and concerts are not able to go ahead as planned, as well as making up for the loss of ticket sales due to reduced seating as a result of social distancing regulations. Initially the measures will protect events of up to 500 participants, so that if from 1 July an event has to be cancelled, the organiser will be fully compensated. From the end of August, in anticipation of events being able to increase in size, that will go up to 2,000 participants. The measures, coming as Germany starts to open up after months of tight restrictions, are on top of a multimillion-euro neustart kultur (new start culture) programme announced last year to cover events across the country. “Life is starting again after a long coronavirus winter,” Scholz said. Monika Grütters, the culture minister, said the fund sent a signal to the cultural industry that its “resuscitation deserves the same amount of effort which is being given to other branches”. Read more of Kate Connolly’s report from Berlin: Germany agrees €2.5bn package to help revive Covid-hit culture sector Yesterday UK housing minister Robert Jenrick was touting next spring as a possible starting date for a Covid inquiry. Opposition Labour MP David Lammy has just joined calls to rapidly bring that date forward in the light of the revelations from Dominic Cummings earlier in the week. Meanwhile on LBC, shock-jock Nick Ferrari has been lambasting business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng saying he should be “kicking the door down” of the prime minister, “banging the desk and saying ‘We have got to stick to 21 June, prime minister!’”. Kwarteng replies “You know what Nick, that’s exactly what I’m doing.” The rest of his answer doesn’t make it sound like he is doing that, however, as he reiterates form his earlier media appearances that “What I can’t do is give guarantees on the 28 May” and continues to hold the line that the government will be following the data and there will not be a decision until 14 June. Mario Koran reports for us from Milwaukee that Wisconsin is the ground zero of America’s battle against vaccine hesitancy: Vaccination rates in Wisconsin vary widely between rural and urban areas and political, religious and racial divides – a pattern that mirrors the divide across the nation. In the progressive stronghold of Dane county – home to the University of Wisconsin-Madison – more than 65% of the population has received one dose. In the state’s rural north, Taylor county has vaccinated only 23.5% of the population, state data shows. Vaccine availability once posed the biggest barrier to immunization. But as availability increased, demand plateaued. Now, healthcare professionals are strategizing ways to reach those who haven’t yet been vaccinated but remain open to it. “Most of our rural residents have the information they need about where and when to get vaccinated. So this is no longer primarily an issue about access to the vaccine. It truly is an issue of what is commonly called vaccine hesitancy,” said Tim Size, executive director of the Rural Wisconsin Health Cooperative, a network of 43 rural hospitals. “I’m not talking about those who just say hell will freeze over before they get the vaccine. That’s not where I think any of us probably need to spend our energy because it’s unlikely to get much traction. I’m talking about the number of people who are communicating that they’re not quite ready yet, but with more information and conversation, they may get there.” Read more of Mario Koran’s report from Milwaukee here: Wisconsin: ground zero of America’s battle against vaccine hesitancy Prof Christina Pagel, from University College London and a member of Independent Sage, said the India variant was causing concern and the road map should be delayed. She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “Certainly we have weakened the link significantly between cases and hospitalisations, but we haven’t broken it.” She added: “We now have fewer restrictions in England than we’ve had since the pandemic started, so if enough people get infected, even a really small proportion who need hospital can still end up being quite large absolute numbers.” Asked whether the planned further lockdown easing for 21 June should not go ahead, she said: “So far we’ve kind of been crossing our fingers a little bit, Sage and Public Health England both say it’s a more transmissible variant, we know it has some levels of vaccine escape. “So we’re in a situation where, compared to two months ago, we now have a dominant variant, it transmits faster, and our vaccines are less effective against it.” PA Media reports that asked if it would be “very demoralising” to remain as we are now, she said: “I think what’s demoralising is having a third wave. If we can just delay international travel, delay stage 4 of the road map until we have a much higher proportion of people vaccinated with two doses, we’re in a much, much better position. “We’re only two months away from that, it’s not long to wait. What I don’t want is for us to have new restrictions.” In the UK, business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has become the latest minister to defend health secretary Matt Hancock, saying “Very few people – if anyone – worked as hard as he did.” Hancock had an awkward time in front of parliament yesterday following accusations by former government adviser Dominic Cummings that he had lied to colleagues and the public during the early stages of the pandemic. Kwarteng said: “I think what Matt stressed very carefully yesterday was that he was absolutely focused, right from the start of the pandemic, on saving people’s lives. “He was in a difficult situation as the Health Secretary, in a pandemic, the like of which we hadn’t seen for 100 years. He was under huge pressure. “And as a Cabinet colleague, I know that he worked really hard and very few people - if anyone - worked as hard as he did and he was very committed to saving lives. Now, he said what he said, I fully believe him but we’ll have an inquiry and that will iron out all these facts.” Poulomi Ghosh reports for the Hindustan Times on a vaccine mix-up causing concern: At least 20 people in Uttar Pradesh’s Siddharthnagar district bordering Nepal were administered with different doses of vaccines, in a case of “negligence”. The 20 people who received two different vaccines in two slots are all from Audahi Kalan village and are aged above 45 years. On 1 April, there were given a dose of Covishield, which was their first dose. On 14 May, they were administered the second dose and as the health workers did not check the card to find out which vaccine was administered to them earlier, they were given Covaxin, by mistake. Reports said none of them reported any adverse effect. There are controlled trials ongoing in some countries of mixing vaccines to see if it increases effectiveness. Murdo Fraser of the Scottish Conservatives has criticised the continued restrictions in place across Glasgow. PA Media reports that he has said if the latest data shows infections are still high then a “more targeted” approach was needed. Areas of Glasgow with higher concentrations of coronavirus infections should be targeted with testing and vaccinations rather than the whole city being subject to “blanket” restrictions, the Scottish Conservatives have said. Fraser told the BBC’s Good Morning Scotland: “Our view is the current council-wide lockdown in Glasgow has not been the right approach. “Large parts of Glasgow do not see large numbers of people infected with Covid and yet are affected by these lockdown restrictions. “If the data is still showing a specific problem in Glasgow what we should be doing is isolating that problem … localised surge testing, accelerating vaccinations in those communities and greater support for local businesses who have been really suffering.” Glasgow has been under strict coronavirus restrictions for 270 days and is the only part of the country under tougher Level 3 constraints. An update on restrictions in Scotland’s largest city is expected later today from first minister Nicola Sturgeon. Overcrowding in Victoria’s healthcare system is a “bigger public health emergency than Covid”, according to a leading emergency physician who says the state’s doctors and nurses were exhausted even before the latest outbreak. Victoria is in a seven-day lockdown with 30 cases of community transmission, more than 120 exposure sites, and 15,000 primary and secondary contacts of cases in isolation. The Australasian College for Emergency Medicine Victoria faculty chair, Dr Mya Cubitt, said on Friday that doctors and nurses in public hospitals had been dreading such a situation because they were still recovering from Victoria’s second wave in 2020. At its height, there were more than 700 new cases in a single day. There were 768 deaths overall with hundreds of healthcare workers infected. “We are in the worst crisis that healthcare has faced in many years,” Cubitt said. “You could even say – and I’d love to speak with [chief health officer Prof] Brett Sutton about this – that the access block and overcrowding of the system is the bigger public health emergency at the moment. Whether we have a Covid outbreak or not, emergency clinicians, and all of the many colleagues that we intersect with in the healthcare system, are under extreme pressure.” Read more of Melissa Davey’s report here: Overcrowding in Victorian hospitals ‘bigger emergency than Covid’, expert warns Sky News have just posted a clip of that Kwasi Kwarteng interview on Twitter. Reuters have been looking at the impact of Covid in the South Asia region, and have found that the tally of cases there, according to their figures, passed 30 million today. They report that the south Asia region - India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Bhutan, Nepal, Maldives and Sri Lanka – accounts for 18% of global cases and almost 10% of deaths. But there is growing suspicion that official tallies of infections and deaths are not reflecting the true extent of the problem. India’s decision to halt the export of vaccines until at least October has had a knock-on effect, with other South Asia countries such as Nepal and Bangladesh making diplomatic efforts to secure Covid-19 vaccines to prop up their faltering inoculation drives as their stocks run out. India’s western neighbour Pakistan, with purchases and donations from China and allocations from the World Health Organisation and the GAVI Vaccine Alliance, has now secured more than 18m doses. Pakistan has opened its vaccination campaign to everyone aged 19 or older. As I mentioned, business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has been on Sky News, and he was rather downbeat when asked about the prospects for the roadmap out of lockdown. He said: We don’t want to proceed with the roadmap without considering all the information that we have. I think that the numbers of cases, is a matter of concern. Today’s the 28th of May. It’s impossible for anyone to know what the situation will be like in a week or two weeks time. On the positive side, he said “the other thing that’s very helpful and encouraging, is the fact that the numbers of hospitalizations, and the number of fatalities as well, is considerably lower than it was even just two months ago” Ultimately he keep reiterating that the UK government would be guided by data: There’s lots of facts that we have to consider. I, as business secretary, I’m very committed to try to reopen on 21 June, I can’t guarantee that. And as I’ve said, we’re looking at the data, every day. The UK government dashboard shows that cases, deaths and hospitalisations are all going up, albeit at much lower levels than they were at the height of the pandemic. Kwarteng confirmed that there would be no decision before 14 June. Good morning from London, it is Martin Belam here – you can get in touch with me at martin.belam@theguardian.com. The UK’s business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng looks to have drawn the short straw for media duties this morning – he’ll be on Sky News in a few moments. While we wait for that, here’s Lizzy Davies on calls for 6m more nurses worldwide: Health ministers around the world are being urged to sign off on plans to create 6m more nursing jobs by 2030, amid warnings that Covid-19 has exacerbated a global shortage and could spark a “brain drain” from the developing world. Delegates meeting virtually this week at the World Health Assembly, the key decision-making body of the World Health Organization, are expected to adopt a resolution calling on countries to transform the nursing profession through more investment, support and training. The WHO director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, called on countries to invest in healthcare workers, nearly 50% of whom are nurses and midwives, saying the pandemic had reminded everyone “that these are incredible people doing incredible jobs under incredible circumstances”. “We owe them so much, and yet globally health and care workers often lack the protection, the equipment, the training, the decent pay, the safe working conditions and the respect they deserve,” he said in his opening remarks. “If we have any hope of achieving a healthier, safer, fairer future, every member state must protect and invest in its health and care workforce as a matter of urgency.” Read more here: ‘Protect and invest’: WHO calls for 6m more nurses worldwide That’s it from me, Helen Sullivan, for today. And if, for a break from pandemic news, you’d like to see a praying mantis wearing “tiny homemade 3D glasses”, might I suggest: Russia has registered the world’s first vaccine for animals against Covid, its agricultural regulator said on Wednesday, after tests showed it generated antibodies against the virus in dogs, cats, foxes and mink, Reuters reports. Mass production of the vaccine, called Carnivac-Cov, can start in April, regulator Rosselkhoznadzor said. The World Health Organization has expressed concern over the transmission of the virus between humans and animals. The regulator said the vaccine would be able to protect vulnerable species and thwart viral mutations. Russia has so far only registered two cases of Covid among animals, both in cats. Denmark culled all 17 million mink on its farms last year after concluding that a strain of the virus had passed from humans to mink and that mutated strains of the virus had then turned up among people. Rosselkhoznadzor said Russian fur farms planned to buy the vaccine, along with businesses in Greece, Poland and Austria. Russia’s fur farm industry accounts for around 3% of the global market, down from 30% in the Soviet era, according to the main trade body. Thailand’s food and drug regulator on Friday approved for emergency use the coroanvirus vaccine developed by China’s Sinopharm, Reuters reports, citing a senior official. “The FDA has approved the Sinopharm vaccine,” senior health official Paisan Dankhum told a news conference, making it the fifth Covid-19 vaccine Thailand has approved. Japanese shares jumped on Friday, as investors scooped up stocks after sell-offs due to MSCI’s reshuffle in the previous session, while progress in the country’s vaccination drive lifted risk appetite on prospects of a swift economic recovery, Reuters reports. The Nikkei share average crossed the 29,000 level for the first time since 11 May, jumping 1.95% to 29,106.86, as of 0205 GMT. The index is poised for a weekly gain of 2.8%. Rollouts of Covid vaccines have contributed to positive sentiment as investors hope a steady vaccination drive can help accelerate economic recovery, market participants said. Japan said on Friday it would consider sharing its Covid vaccines with other countries as a ruling party committee urged it to provide a portion of its AstraZeneca Plc vaccine stock to Taiwan, Reuters reports. Taiwan is battling a spike in domestic infections and has vaccinated only about 1% of its population, while Japan has secured more than 400 million doses, double what it needs for its adult population. “We think it’s important to ensure fair access to safe and effective vaccines in every country and region towards achieving universal health coverage,” Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato told a news conference. “We will swiftly consider and look into a concrete course of policy with regard to how we provide other countries and regions with vaccines that exceed the amount for those needed at home. Masahisa Sato, the head of a Japanese ruling party committee on Taiwan relations, said earlier on Friday the government should provide Taiwan with vaccines as soon as possible, adding “when Japan was in need Taiwan sent us 2 million masks.” Kato declined to comment whether Tokyo had received supply requests from specific countries. India reported on Friday 186,364 new coronavirus infections during the previous 24 hours, for its lowest daily rise since April 14, while deaths rose by 3,660. The South Asian nation’s tally of infections now stands at 27.56 million, with the death toll at 318,895, health ministry data show. Japan is expected to extend emergency coronavirus measures in Tokyo and several other regions by about three weeks, according to officials, as the country struggles to rein in a fourth wave of infections less than two months before the Olympics. The state of emergency – the third in the capital since the start of the pandemic – was called in late April and was originally due to end on 11 May, but was extended until the end of this month, as restrictions on businesses failed to make a dent in infections. Media reports said the latest extension could last until 20 June. Infections have fallen in Tokyo in recent days, but the daily caseload is still too high to justify an end to the measures, according to medical experts, while hospitals are contending with a record number of critically ill Covid-19 patients: Hello and welcome to today’s live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic with me, Helen Sullivan. As always, you can get in touch with me on Twitter @helenrsullivan. India reported on Friday 186,364 new coronavirus infections during the previous 24 hours, for its lowest daily rise since April 14, while deaths rose by 3,660. The South Asian nation’s tally of infections now stands at 27.56 million, with the death toll at 318,895, health ministry data show. Meanwhile Japan is expected to extend emergency coronavirus measures in Tokyo and several other regions by about three weeks, according to officials, as the country struggles to rein in a fourth wave of infections less than two months before the Olympics. Here are the key developments from the last few hours: Argentina reported a record one-day number of new Covid-19 cases of 41,080 on Thursday, amid a second wave of infections that has made the country one of the hardest hit in the world, pushing the local health care system to its limit. Africa needs at least 20m doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine within six weeks if those who have had their first shot are to get the second in time, the WHO said on Thursday. Up to three-quarters of new UK Covid cases are thought to be caused by the variant first detected in India, as the reported number more than doubled to almost 7,000, Matt Hancock said on Thursday. The United States called on Thursday for the World Health Organization to carry out a second phase of its investigation into the origins of the coronavirus, with independent experts given full access to original data and samples in China. The US intelligence community acknowledged its agencies had two theories on where Covid-19 originated, with an element embracing a possible laboratory accident as the source of the pandemic. US President Joe Biden said he is likely to release a report detailing the US intelligence community’s findings on the origins of Covid-19 in full. Sweden will go forward with its plan to ease some of its Covid curbs from June 1, prime minister Stefan Lofven said. Germany plans to make enough Covid vaccine doses available to offer a first shot to all children aged 12 and over by the end of August, a draft health ministry document showed.","charCount":"76506","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/mattha-busby\">Mattha Busby</a> (now); <a href=\"profile/rhi-storer\">Rhi Storer</a>, <a href=\"profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a> and <a href=\"profile/helen-sullivan\">Helen Sullivan</a> (earlier)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2021/may/28/lancashire-v-yorkshire-durham-v-essex-and-more-county-cricket-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-28T19:11:55Z","webTitle":"Lancashire v Yorkshire, Durham v Essex and more: county cricket – live!","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2021/may/28/lancashire-v-yorkshire-durham-v-essex-and-more-county-cricket-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2021/may/28/lancashire-v-yorkshire-durham-v-essex-and-more-county-cricket-live","fields":{"headline":"Lancashire v Yorkshire, Durham v Essex and more: county cricket – live!","standfirst":"<ul><li>County Championship updates from day two of the latest round</li><li>The Spin: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/18/sign-up-to-the-spin\">sign up to our email</a>.

The crowds were back at Old Trafford for the first time in 617 days and, what’s more, the sun obliged, a distant heat haze rippling over the Manchester skyscrapers.</p> <p><strong>Yorkshire</strong>, who won the toss and chose to bat, took the opportunity to flirt with a record – their lowest ever total at Old Trafford. At 21 for six, and 40 for seven, 51 looked a stretch, with <strong>Lancashire</strong>’s Saqib Mahmood and Tom Bailey in particular bowling searching spells. Bailey’s figures were a parsimonious 14-11-6-3.</p> <p>But Yorkshire had a gem in Harry Duke, the 19-year old wicketkeeper playing in only his second first-class match, and who had collected a golden duck in his one previous innings. From nervous bolter walking out at 21 for 5, he found his mojo and, full of youthful vim, stroked the ball simply and through the covers. He and Steven Patterson, all elbows and knees, put on 77 for the 10th wicket before Ben Coad and Duanne Olivier thrashed about to take the total over 150.</p> <p>Alex Davies then teed off from the start, reaching his 50 to a happy crescendo of applause before tickling Olivier behind for 52. Jennings and Wells played out till the close, with just under 2,000 people watching Dom Bess twirling in from the Brian Statham End and revelling in Lancashire’s day.</p> <p>Sixteen wickets fell at The Riverside as both <strong>Essex</strong> and <strong>Durham</strong> suffered batting malfunctions. First, Essex lost five wickets for three runs after Michael Pepper was out for 92, as Durham hoovered up their tail. Durham, in turn, collapsed to 58 for six post-tea, five of them lbw.</p> <p><strong>Northamptonshire</strong>’s Ben Sanderson filched five wickets at Hove for the third time in the past four innings, though it could not prevent a <strong>Sussex</strong> fightback. They had been in deep trouble at 67 for eight, before Jack Carson and Henry Crocombe tickled 99 for the ninth wicket. Facing 175, Northants then lost four wickets by the close.</p> <p>Three wickets for <strong>Leicestershire</strong>’s Callum Parkinson, including two in two balls, failed to pin <strong>Middlesex</strong> down as a seventh-wicket stand of 90 between John Simpson and Luke Hollman took them to respectability at stumps.</p> <p>A steady day at Edgbaston, led by 91 from <strong>Warwickshire</strong>’s Will Rhodes at the top of the order, was hijacked by Dane Paterson who snatched three wickets for <strong>Nottinghamshire</strong> in evening sunshine; while the England Under-19 batsman Jack Haynes hit a career best 97 for <strong>Worcestershire</strong> against <strong>Derbyshire</strong> at New Road before being caught on the boundary. Hashim Amla, leading <strong>Surrey</strong> for the first time, made an unbeaten century against <strong>Gloucestershire</strong>, and received a standing ovation from the Oval crowd.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60b0a2e18f08d486a7715878\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-05-28T09:26:27.902Z\">10.26am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Good morning!</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>It’s day two and there’s a dampness to the air</strong>.

As are Surrey, Middlesex and Essex. Still tight at Hove if Sussex can build all day tomorrow. That’s it from me, enjoy your Friday celebrations, goodnight! Losing my marbles. Just watched this... and thought - blimey, I didn’t even realise Kerrigan was bowling. Must concentrate. He left Lancashire in September 2018. Anyway, well done him, Sussex 79-3, Kerrigan 2-10. Lancashire 287-4; rain at Edgbaston and New Road; Essex still five down; Leicestershire have nurdled another 20 odd but lost Callum Parkinson. I better think about the round up, it could take my brain a while today. Will try to pop back with stats etc. How about Dane Vilas smoothing Paterson down the ground for four, then pulling him,down on a hind leg, towards the cagoul clad behind square? “Haseeb Hameed and Ben Slater continue to frustrate the Warwickshire bowlers, who have plugged away with tight lines but found the Nottinghamshire pair their equals. Hameed looking nice and compact, sniffing the ball out in defence and clipping the ball around for runs in workmanlike fashion ... and as I type that he neatly guides one past backward point for four like Ian Bell at his best. Nottinghamshire 50 for no loss in the 21st over with Hameed on 31 and Slater on 19.” Group One Riverside: Durham 99 all out v Essex 182 all out and 160-5* Edgbaston: Warwickshire 341 all out v Nottinghamshire 51-0 took an early tea New Road: Worcestershire 421 all out v Derbyshire 2-0 Group Two Grace Road: Leicestershire 108-7 v Middlesex 295 all out The Oval: Surrey 473 all out v Gloucestershire Group Three Old Trafford: Lancashire 266-4 v Yorkshire 159 all out Hove: Sussex 175 all out and 65-1 v Northants 256 all out The Lancashire lead passes one hundred on the brink of tea. We’ve slumped back into slow-go land here at OT, Lancs 257-4; while Ten Doeschate and Wheater are picking up runs for fun at Chester le Street. Their partnership more than a hundred, Durham’s target galloping over the horizon. Great to see the ECB adding a little more diversity to the match referee’s panel. Devon Malcolm and Dean Headley are amongst the new names on the list of the new Supplementary Panel (created to give more opportunities to match refereees). They join Will Smith, Alec Swann and Simon Hinks. Sue Laister has been appointed to match referee this weekend’s Rachael Heyhoe Flint Trophy match between Northern Diamonds and Central Sparks at Headingley, becoming, in the process, the first female Match Referee of a professional domestic match in England and Wales. An email awaits. Hello Tim(would you like a cold flannel?) “Just got back from a rare post-COVID trip to the pub to watch my beloved Western Bulldogs get their arses handed to them on a plate by the evil Melbourne Demons in a much-anticipated yet bitterly disappointing top-of-the-table clash. As a result, I am in the mood to burn something down and can think of no better victim than LBW. Here goes. We need to give umpire’s call to the batsman and adjust games not being ruled/ruined (your choice) by TV umpires in the same way. It was never intended to be one of the primary methods of dismissal, but was only introduced to deal with cads and bounders standing in front of the stumps. The world - and the game - would be a better place if we put it in its proper place. A nice GIF of someone lighting the blue touch paper and retreating to a safe distance would go very nicely here. P.S. Next week we allow injured batsmen to have runners but allow fielders to go full Rollerball on them: bodychecks and blindside hits all fair game. P.P.S. Also it’s time to let go of your pro-Lancashire smugness and accept what you know from your time spent in Yorkshire: this game is an utter disaster, isn’t proper cricket and the balls are clearly fixed in favour of the red rosers.” Still raining at Worcesters and at Edgbaston, where they’ve taken tea with Notts 28-0. And at Chester-le-Street, ten Doeschate and Wheater have decided that speed is of the essence, putting on 81 in 17 overs from the ignominy of 53-5. Essexc currently 139-5, a lead of 222. At The Oval, Hashim Amla has been bowled for a mammoth 173, by Miles Hammond. Surrey 430-8. Sussex have only lost the one wicket in their second innings, Thomason for 8, still trail Northants by 51. Parkinson (C) and Lewis Hill rattling a few for the seventh wicket against Middlesex, though they seem but dust in the wind. Leics 86-6, trail by 209. And another! Wells is furious with himself, giving Kohler-Cadmore his second catch at first slip. An invaluable 60 in a stand of 175 with Jennings in 66.4 overs And just as he was cutting loose.... caught off Ben Coad at first slip for 114. Jennings tucks his bat under his left armpit as he departs. Then pauses to salute the crowd, to the fans huddling under the point, to the pavilion, to A and B stand. And with a drive through the covers, Keaton Jennings reaches his hundred! A hug with Luke Wells, a two-step of delight, and off with his helmet as he raises his bat to the dressing-room and all round the ground to the crowd, many on their feet. Hi first first-class hundred since he made 146 not out for England v Sri Lanka in November 2018. A nice little story on Moeen Ali playing in the Birmingham League on Saturday. The England management have agreed he can play for West Bromwich Dartmouth against Walsall in Premier Division One. He’ll be joined by his brother, Omar, his cousin, the former England swing bowler, Kabir, and another cousin, Ismail Mohammed, who is on the staff at Worcestershire And with a six off a no ball, a Bess high, high, full toss, Luke Wells reaches his first fifty for Lancashire. Wi\\th Lancs 214-1, Yorkshire take the new ball. They’ve been asking for a new one all day. Now let’s see if they can do owt with this one. Northants are all out for 256, Sanderson and Berg uoompa loompaing 51 for the last wicket. A prickly lead over Sussex of 81. Four wickets for the promising Garton, two to the equally promising Crocombe. UPDATE “We’ve just had the first “gerronwithit” from the Edgbaston crowd in 18 months (not sure why they had a Nottinghamshire accent.)” Andersson picks up three quick wickets, 3-6 to be exact, at Grace Road, as Leicestershire stumble and fall face down in a puddle. 48-6, trail Middlesex by 247. Will it be curtains tonight at CLS? Essex 68-5, though disappointingly Walter and Pepper were both caught. The Essex lead 155. Keaton reverse-sweeps Bess for four. Easy as pie. Just saying whispering that... if KJ were to reach three figures, it would be for the first time in first-class cricket since November 2018 when he scored 146 for England against Sri Lanka. Off for rain at Edgbaston too. When I walked round the ground at lunch and heard someone in the nets, my first thought was: I bet that’s Has. Old habits, etc. Hameed watch: Hello Tanya at Old Trafford, Ali Martin at Edgbaston here. In between penning a Test series preview for the Observer and a big interview with Tim Southee for Monday’s paper - and before taking my eldest to All Stars cricket later - I’ve been watching Haseeb Hameed bat ahead of his return to the England fold. Some wonderful tail-end swish from Oliver Hannon-Dalby and Liam Norwell (the former giving it both barrels) took Warwickshire to 341 and set up a tricky period of play before lunch for the Nottinghamshire openers. Hameed and Ben Slater survived and have now resumed after vittles (fish and chips in the press box). Hameed, he of the recent England call-up, has taken one blow to the hand from Norwell - a slightly worrying feature of his game - but otherwise the pair have held firm with Notts 28 for none. Rain at Worcestershire. Pepper and Walter have doubled the score, and more, at The Riverside - Essex 38-3. Amla moving inevitably towards 150 at The Oval; and Northants have a lead of 38 with one wicket left at Hove. Celebrity fan. A lap of the ground and back in time to see Keaton Jennings unleash his inner David Gower. I can tell you that it costs £5 for a pint of ice-cold Fosters, which seems on the extortionate side, but what do I know of matters beer. Lots of members warming up in the OT Cafe Nero, others milling round the Members’ Representative desk outside the pavilion. A murmur, a content murmur. Essex?!?!?! Alastair Cook gone for single figures for the second time in the match. Browne and Westley fell either side. Two more lbws to make it 14 in the match, and the last 18 wickets have been lost for 117 runs. Time for lunch and a stretch. Back in 40. mins. Group One Riverside: Durham 99 all out v Essex 182 all out and 15-3!!!!

Scores to follow. Drizzle in the Manchester air so the covers come on. Thanks to Hoppsy for tweeting this - and to point out that these figures do not include the scholarship kids like Joe and Billy Root and Haseeb Hameed. And a thoughtful email from Nat Goodden on a similar theme. “This is left over from last week – I e’d you a few minutes after you’d (very reasonably) logged off. Whitchurch High School – someone had e’d you about its interesting (I’d say amazing) record for producing sporting stars – mentioning Gareth Bale, but without adding both Geraint Thomas (Tour de France winner, also a second place, yes?) and Sam Warburton (Wales and Lions rugby captain). All within 2 or 3 years, I believe. And it’s a proper STATE school! Re Durham LBW’s yesterday – even more extraordinary seems the total number of LBW’s given, Essex ones included – 11 in all by my count. Now is that a record, or what?” In my book all state schools should have a proper playing field, even if that means requisitioning land from next door office buildings or building new schools elsewhere. Even if pupils hate sport they can benefit from sitting in a green environment at lunchtime with all the benefits we know that brings. I defy you to listen to this and not have a little cry. Ed Barnard’s 2021 season is run-heavy - I’ve just clocked he’s 86 not out, with Dillan Pennington hanging on in there, 22 not out, in an attempts to get him over the line. Worcestershire 417-9. Through the covers Keaton, head over knee, arcing bat. A hundred and seventy-seven balls of dedication - and 28 of the 53 came in seven fours. Northants inch into the lead at Hove, as Saif Zaib passes 50 for the third time in his last 4 innings. Nice little fight back from 107-5. Not the best of starts at Grace Road, where Leicestershire are 2-1. Hassan Azad gone for a duck to Ethan Bamber in what is proving to be rather an unkind season. averaging 31, compared to 54 in 2019. Much to Gloucestershire’s irritation, Hashim Amla and Sean Abbott have now put on 53 for the seventh wicket, with Amla on a 250-ball 121 not out. Jennings awakes from his slumbers to crack Patterson for four - three more runs and he’ll have his fourth fifty in five innings. Lancs 136-1. Time to change the sheets. Durham all out 99. Essex lead by 83 runs, which is more than generous. Middlesex 295 all out, John Simpson left high and dry on 95. Yorkshire try to change the ball in desperation, but the umpires tell them to hurry along. Durham are down and nearly out at 99-9 against Essex; Harmer hasn’t even had a bowl yet. Luke Fletcher has grabbed his first wicket of the day at Edgbaston, swiftly followed by Paterson snatching his fifth as Danny Lamb is caught for 67. Warwicks 293-9 Yorkshire are giving Bess a go from the Brian Statham end, Long sleeves, baggy trousers that could do with a hitch, he has a endearingly scruffy air, most unlike his opponent Mister wax and polish Jennings. He dries, dries, dries the ball again on his shirt. Lancashire have scored 19 runs in 45 minutes. Proper Roses. A pocket of early morning wickets: Ned Eckersley (a sixth lbw) and Brydon Carse at The Riverside, Durham 79-8; Danny Briggs at Edgbaston, as Paterson continues where he left off yesterday, Warwicks 270-7; Tom Helm at Grace Road, Middx 279-8; and in the umbrella-biter at Hove,Simon Kerrigan has been bowled by George Garton, Northants 121-5. And lo, Keaton Jennings pulls Olivier across the verdant grass and into the boundary boards, with a crack of the bat and to a crescendo of local applause. An email. Good Morning Brian. “Morning Tanya The Durham commentator tells us that yesterday was the only time that Durham have lost their first five wickets lbw. (Judging by the way they were offering their pads so freely I had half-suspected they were on some sort of ‘charity sponsorship’, if that’s the acceptable euphemism for spot fixing.) More generally, I’m wondering who holds the (presumably unwanted) county record for most consecutive lbw dismissals?” This is definitely one for BTL. A tickle brings a trudge: Jamie Overton slopes back over The Oval rope, out to the first ball of the day. Surrey 285-6. A couple of overs under the belt at Old Trafford, not much to report apart from some deliciously sticky biscotti and a discussion about how much more together Keaton Jennings looks this season. Group One Riverside: Durham 58-6 v Essex 182 all out Edgbaston: Warwickshire 250-6 v Nottinghamshire New Road: Worcestershire 336-7 v Derbyshire Group Two Grace Road: Leicestershire v Middlesex 260-7 The Oval: Surrey 285-5 v Gloucestershire Group Three Old Trafford: Lancashire 95-1 v Yorkshire 159 all out Hove: Sussex 175 all out v Northants 91-4 The swifts darted over the tram lines for the 221st Roses Championship match, and in the car park a man carefully folded his jacket over his arm and picked up his picnic bag. The crowds were back at Old Trafford for the first time in 617 days and, what’s more, the sun obliged, a distant heat haze rippling over the Manchester skyscrapers. Yorkshire, who won the toss and chose to bat, took the opportunity to flirt with a record – their lowest ever total at Old Trafford. At 21 for six, and 40 for seven, 51 looked a stretch, with Lancashire’s Saqib Mahmood and Tom Bailey in particular bowling searching spells. Bailey’s figures were a parsimonious 14-11-6-3. But Yorkshire had a gem in Harry Duke, the 19-year old wicketkeeper playing in only his second first-class match, and who had collected a golden duck in his one previous innings. From nervous bolter walking out at 21 for 5, he found his mojo and, full of youthful vim, stroked the ball simply and through the covers. He and Steven Patterson, all elbows and knees, put on 77 for the 10th wicket before Ben Coad and Duanne Olivier thrashed about to take the total over 150. Alex Davies then teed off from the start, reaching his 50 to a happy crescendo of applause before tickling Olivier behind for 52. Jennings and Wells played out till the close, with just under 2,000 people watching Dom Bess twirling in from the Brian Statham End and revelling in Lancashire’s day. Sixteen wickets fell at The Riverside as both Essex and Durham suffered batting malfunctions. First, Essex lost five wickets for three runs after Michael Pepper was out for 92, as Durham hoovered up their tail. Durham, in turn, collapsed to 58 for six post-tea, five of them lbw. Northamptonshire’s Ben Sanderson filched five wickets at Hove for the third time in the past four innings, though it could not prevent a Sussex fightback. They had been in deep trouble at 67 for eight, before Jack Carson and Henry Crocombe tickled 99 for the ninth wicket. Facing 175, Northants then lost four wickets by the close. Three wickets for Leicestershire’s Callum Parkinson, including two in two balls, failed to pin Middlesex down as a seventh-wicket stand of 90 between John Simpson and Luke Hollman took them to respectability at stumps. A steady day at Edgbaston, led by 91 from Warwickshire’s Will Rhodes at the top of the order, was hijacked by Dane Paterson who snatched three wickets for Nottinghamshire in evening sunshine; while the England Under-19 batsman Jack Haynes hit a career best 97 for Worcestershire against Derbyshire at New Road before being caught on the boundary. Hashim Amla, leading Surrey for the first time, made an unbeaten century against Gloucestershire, and received a standing ovation from the Oval crowd. It’s day two and there’s a dampness to the air. Paul Allott is walking gingerly over the outfield in his hush puppies, while over on the white rose side of the ground, Yorkshire are playing touch rugby. Adam Lyth is resplendent in knee high white socks, not a sign of surrender of course.","charCount":"16770","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/tanyaaldred\">Tanya Aldred</a> at Old Trafford"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2021/may/28/champions-league-final-tactics-where-the-game-could-be-won-and-lost-manchester-city-chelsea","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-28T19:00:04Z","webTitle":"Champions League final: where the game could be won and lost | Jonathan Wilson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/may/28/champions-league-final-tactics-where-the-game-could-be-won-and-lost-manchester-city-chelsea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2021/may/28/champions-league-final-tactics-where-the-game-could-be-won-and-lost-manchester-city-chelsea","fields":{"headline":"Champions League final tactics: where the game could be won and lost","standfirst":"<p>Manchester City’s high defensive line, Chelsea’s wing-back issues and other factors to look out for in Porto</p>","trailText":"Manchester City’s high defensive line, Chelsea’s wing-back issues and other factors to look out for in Porto","byline":"Jonathan Wilson","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"62277bbcc20275cd02bdca1d6aa8ff2d49bfc130\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/62277bbcc20275cd02bdca1d6aa8ff2d49bfc130/0_0_3212_2131/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Reece James has recently been used by Chelsea on the right of a back three but would be more valuable in the final against Manchester City as a wing-back.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Reece James has recently been used by Chelsea on the right of a back three but would be more valuable in the final against Manchester City as a wing-back.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Javier García/BPI/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<h2>City’s high line</h2> <p>The problem historically for Pep Guardiola sides in Europe has been the high line that he operates, which means that if the press goes awry, his teams can be vulnerable to balls in behind them – as happened for Bayern against Real Madrid in 2014 and against Barcelona in 2015, and for City against Monaco in 2017, Liverpool in 2018 and Lyon last year.

Jeanette Shields, 70, was dropped on the floor after a routine operation at the Cumberland Infirmary, Carlisle, according to her husband, John Shields. She was being treated after breaking her hip while at the hospital with gall stones. “I was told the operation went well but there’s been a serious incident where they dropped my wife on the floor,” Johns Shields said. He said that he was first informed by hospital staff in a phone call late in the evening of the day of the incident, but North Cumbria integrated care NHS foundation trust have said they are not in a position to confirm any details regarding the case while an inquiry is ongoing. The trust said an investigation was under way “in relation to an incident involving a patient in one of our theatres” and that regulators have been informed. A spokesperson for the trust added: “The outcome of the investigation will also determine any further action that we will need to take. We remain in regular contact with the patient’s family.” However, John Shields claimed this was not the case and that he had not had any communication with the hospital since he was called to Cumberland Infirmary for an interview about the incident with senior trust staff on 11 April. Shields was rushed to the hospital’s intensive care unit and spent time on a ventilator “before deteriorating and passing away” six weeks later. John Shields said: “Before she passed, my wife told me and my daughters, ‘you take this further for what they’ve done to me’.” Shields said he was “heartbroken” to have lost his “dear wife”.

The president’s first budget is largely a political document, and faces months of difficult negotiations in Congress where Republicans are already balking at the scale of his spending plans. But it clearly sets out Biden’s ambition to remake the US after the coronavirus pandemic. “Now is the time to build on the foundation that we’ve laid, to make bold investments in our families, in our communities, in our nation,” Biden told a crowd in Cleveland on Thursday. “We know from history that these kinds of investments raise both the floor and the ceiling of an economy for everybody.” The White House has set out a two-part plan to overhaul the US economy by upgrading its infrastructure and expanding its social safety net. The costs of the programmes would lead to the US running annual deficits of over $1.3tn over the next decade and debt rising to 117% of the value of economic output by 2031. Alongside rebuilding bridges, roads, airports and other infrastructure, Biden has proposed a $13bn federal investment to roll out broadband internet access. Democrats are also pushing to expand and reform the US’s social programmes with government money for paid family leave and universal pre-school. In part the plan would be funded by tax increases on corporations and the very wealthy. Biden has already proposed increasing US corporation taxes to 28% from 21%, a plan opposed by all Republicans and some Democrats. Biden has said he is willing to negotiate with his political opponents on the shape and size of his proposals, but he will struggle to find Republican support for his agenda. No Republicans voted for his $1.9tn Covid stimulus bill and he has already been forced to scale back his infrastructure bill to $1.7tn from the originally proposed $2.2tn effort. The economy has improved markedly since Biden took office and the pandemic began to wane in the US. More than half of the country is now fully vaccinated and hiring has picked up as the economy has reopened. But the Biden administration believes the pandemic highlighted many structural issues with the US economy that need to be addressed by federal spending. Unemployment rates for Black and Latino Americans remain disproportionately high and women were hit particularly hard by the pandemic recession – in many cases because a lack of affordable childcare prevented them from working. A huge increase in government spending has fueled concerns about rising inflation. Prices on goods including lumber, cars and chicken have soared in recent months, and the commerce department said on Friday that the personal consumption expenditures index, a key measure of inflation, increased by 3.1% in April from a year ago, its highest level since 1992. On Thursday the treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, said the budget would push US debt above the size of the US economy, but said the proposed plan was responsible and would not contribute to inflationary pressures. “I believe it is a fiscally responsible program,” Yellen told a House appropriations subcommittee.","charCount":"3298","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/dominic-rushe\">Dominic Rushe</a> in New York"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}

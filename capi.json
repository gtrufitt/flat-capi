Hotel quarantine is not a perfect system. </p> <p>As Paul Kelly’s referred to this in estimates, it is still probably the most powerful and positive public health intervention that Australia could have made back in March last year.</p> <p> It has gotten us to that state of no community transmission that has made a world of difference on the global scale, in terms of how we have managed to open up in Australia and how we have managed to protect so many Australians from dying from Covid. There will be ongoing challenges with hotel quarantine. We just need to continue to investigate and improve as much as possible and where alternatives that can be built exist, we should pursue those also.</p> </blockquote> <p>Side note: I haven’t seen that “1 in 42 positive cases” myself so I can’t vouch for that in terms of accuracy.

We need to look at what the causes are but, as the acting premier said, as every first minister or head of quarantine or public health across the country has said, we need to look at every single aspect, every mitigation in hotel quarantine because they are not from an engineering point of view, the most ideal – they’re not open air.</p> </blockquote> <p>Another reporter:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Do you have ongoing confidence in hotel quarantine in Victoria?</p> </blockquote> <p>Sutton:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Yes, absolutely.

Under the new restrictions, regional brothels are allowed 100 customers a day. One reporter has asked why this is the case when you can only have two visitors in your home, and chief health officer Brett Sutton says the answer is scale: Visitors to the home are a cumulative risk. We are talking about hundreds of thousands, millions of homes across Victoria. When you have a particular easing of a restriction for an indoor environment, the most high-risk environment indeed for coronavirus, you have to look at the cumulative effect at what it means to allow two people, plus dependants, excluding kids under 12 months, across hundreds of thousands of homes. For other venues, you are also looking at the cumulative risk, and if there are only three or four of those venues, if there are no casinos, if there are a few other settings you are talking about using restrictions, the cumulative risk is not the same as what it means to change the settings for a private gathering. Of course, if you are looking at my home versus what I am able to do in another setting, it looks out of accord, but we have to look at what it means to make these changes across the board, understanding what it means for millions and millions of person-to-person interactions. Sutton has been asked why the lockdown measures have to ease tomorrow night not right this second. There are complex legal drafting matters to be done that needs to be measured against all of the charted considerations for each and every charter obligation that is in play with restrictions. And to make sure that it is not a sloppy process. We need to go through with a fine-tooth comb to make sure every single drafted peas with the public health directions are appropriate and correct. You are talking about public health advice. So good news, Melbourne is coming out of lockdown. Bad news, this means the federal government’s already fairly narrow wages support package will be cut off. Merlino says the federal government has rejected requests for this funding to be extended: These are the settings that the federal government put in place. They put a lot of conditions on the funding. We welcome the additional support but acknowledge that whether it is the conditions that they set, the taxing arrangements that they put to that funding, that is a decision that they have made. We understand hardship doesn’t end at 11.59pm tomorrow night. I can confirm that Tim Palace, our treasurer, reached out to the federal treasurer to advocate for the continuation of support. My understanding is that is not forthcoming but in terms of questions of additional income support and continuation of that support, that should be put to the federal government. Now it’s time to talk about Victoria’s hospital capacity, which has been feeling the strain in recent months. Reporter: How would our hospitals cope with a Covid surge if one were to happen? We don’t have enough nurses and there aren’t enough beds as is. Are you concerned if we were to have another outbreak, our hospital won’t be able to cope? Health minister Martin Foley: I am concerned about every case of Covid. In terms of preparation by our healthcare system, as we have seen, for instance, in the private residential aged care system with the Arcare Maidstone number of cases, I think it is three residents out there, whether it is aged care to be immediately moved into hospitals where it has been run which has happened with those three cases there. Whether it is prioritising all the work in a number of particular hospitals that would be best placed should there be cases that need hospitalisation, we have done a lot of preparatory work with those hospitals in the healthcare system and in a collaborative way to be ready should that happen. That is why these public health measures that we have been taking in the past few weeks are designed to avoid that set of circumstances. Sutton says while hotel quarantine is not perfect, it’s still a very important part of Australia’s Covid-19 response, which didn’t actually answer the question he was asked. Have a look. Reporter: The statistics ... relate to the number of positive cases. Per positive case with one in every 42 positive cases is a breach. That is the highest rate of any state per cases. Do you have any idea why that is? These are recent figures. Sutton: Sure. Hotel quarantine is not a perfect system. As Paul Kelly’s referred to this in estimates, it is still probably the most powerful and positive public health intervention that Australia could have made back in March last year. It has gotten us to that state of no community transmission that has made a world of difference on the global scale, in terms of how we have managed to open up in Australia and how we have managed to protect so many Australians from dying from Covid. There will be ongoing challenges with hotel quarantine. We just need to continue to investigate and improve as much as possible and where alternatives that can be built exist, we should pursue those also. Side note: I haven’t seen that “1 in 42 positive cases” myself so I can’t vouch for that in terms of accuracy. I’ll see if I can find out where that came from. More questions for Sutton (he has been up for quite a while now, come on Merlino, help a bro out!) Reporter: Between the end of October and June, Victoria has had the highest rate of hotel quarantine breaches per case of any other state, with one in every 42 cases of breach. Why is this? Sutton: We have had fewer breaches than some other jurisdictions with respect to hotel quarantine. We need to look at what the causes are but, as the acting premier said, as every first minister or head of quarantine or public health across the country has said, we need to look at every single aspect, every mitigation in hotel quarantine because they are not from an engineering point of view, the most ideal – they’re not open air. Another reporter: Do you have ongoing confidence in hotel quarantine in Victoria? Sutton: Yes, absolutely. Again, it doesn’t mean we should never consider that there isn’t a risk of the virus coming out of hotel quarantine. You can check out a full table of the new restrictions here. If you prefer a version without an eye-wateringly busy layout, I’ll link to the Guardian Australia explainer as soon as it’s updated. The federal treasurer (and Victorian resident) Josh Frydenberg released an op-ed today calling for school closures to be used as an absolute last resort in the case of a Covid outbreak. Merlino was just asked about this: Moving to remote learning is a last resort, absolutely is a last resort and for last couple of weeks, our schools have been open for vulnerable children and for children of authorised workers. We are in a position, based on public health advice, to have our year 11s and 12s back at school last Friday. I am pleased, as education minister and a parent, that on Friday, all children will be back at school. The Victorian Liberal opposition is gunning hard for more transparency around health decisions. Merlino was just been asked what he thinks of this tactic. Reporter: The Victorian opposition is calling for the health advice behind lockdowns to be made public. Do you support that? Merlino: I am very happy to deal with this myth that the Liberals are pedalling around transparency. We have got the public health directions which are publicly available. That is the public health advice, signed off by Victoria’s chief health officer. We have got experts standing up every day answering all sorts of questions, Prof Sutton, Prof Cheng, Covid-19 commander, commissioner Casser from CQV and in the parliament, in terms of the state of emergency legislation, there is a written report provided by the chief health officer monthly and a briefing to the parliament on the pandemic. Being absolutely transparent and clear with people, in terms of the situation, the settings that are in place and the reasons why, this is a complete myth pedalled by the Liberals. Merlino is making no promises on further lockdowns: In terms of any further lockdowns, whether we are talking about Victoria, New South Wales, WA or SA this is a global pandemic and it is impacting our nation. The path to easing of restrictions completely and living a normal life is the successful rollout of the Commonwealth’s vaccination program and the construction and the operation of a purpose-built quarantine facility for our highest risk people. That has always been the path through this pandemic. In meantime, we make our hotel quarantine system as safe as we possibly can, and if and when there is an outbreak, we absolutely run it to ground so we can get back to the life that we’re enjoying just a few weeks ago. Sutton has been asked when people in Victoria can expect to “snap back” to pre-outbreak conditions: It is a week-by-week respect, as the acting premier has flagged, we are looking aspirationally to the kind of levels that regional Victoria are moving to now in a further week. That would be my further hope. We can be surprised on a day-by-day basis around what can emerge, and we have to recognise it remains a reasonably volatile situation. The idea of a snap back to absolutely no restrictions whatsoever, no one has done that after significant community transmission, it didn’t happen after Avalon, it hasn’t happened after other significant community outbreaks, and so we have to move by increments, safely, but with the minimum restrictions that we know will continue to control this. Reporter: Where do you believe there are people not in quarantine who should be who would spread it if we open it up fully today? Sutton: Well, if I knew where they were, we wouldn’t be worried about them. It is potentially undetected cases out there and we have had a few mystery cases over the last couple of weeks, you know, as recently as a week or so ago. So it is needing to have that high level of testing in coming days to be absolutely sure that there are no undetected chains of transmission. The Delta variant is one in particular that is obviously being discovered through people coming forward for testing which doesn’t have that intermediary case, necessarily, with hotel quarantine. I would want to be absolutely sure that we can find if there are any cases. But also, with the other variants, the Kappa variant, we have had a number of cases where acquisition is it absolutely clear, so we just need to run back down as much as possible. Remember back in the day when everyone was pretending that we weren’t going for the elimination of Covid-19? No one would admit we were all aiming for zero. Well how the times have changed - here is what Victorian chief health officer Brett Sutton has to say: So just a huge thank you from me for ... everybody who has made a sacrifice through this period of lockdown. It is an awfully painful period, I have always had in mind that we need to do what is required to make sure that we get back down to zero. There is really no alternative. Our national strategy of aggressive suppression is there for a reason. If you do not get to zero, there is no grumbling along with one or two cases. This started with one case in Wollert that has led to almost 100 cases over a period of a few weeks. So we absolutely have to drive it back down to zero. But this has been the national strategy for a reason. It is what allows the travel bubble, what allows our internal borders to be open again. Foley is laying out the total case number for all the clusters across greater Melbourne. Here is where we stand for each of those different aspects of the outbreak, as of yesterday. In the city of Whittlesea outbreaks, we have identified 1500 primary close contacts to that outbreak, and the Port Melbourne outbreaks, we have seen 2100 primary close contacts. These numbers are continuing to fall each day as people finalise their quarantine period. And as these numbers fall, so to do the list of exposure sites linked to these aspects of the original part of this outbreak. There are now fewer than 200 exposure sites online, and we expect as sites and primary close contacts continue to be cleared, that this figure should continue to come down. In regards to the private residential aged care outbreaks, the Arcare Maidstone location, where we have seen 1057 primary close contacts, that number grew as a result of the case associated with the family member yesterday, and a number of those sites have been added as of yesterday. With the West Melbourne cluster, which is still moving and shifting, in fact, we have seen that number of primary close contacts grow to 1112, obviously the majority of test results which continue to come in from the outbreak have given the public health team the confidence they need to make these recommendations that the acting premier has just announced. So what about this person who was diagnosed today? Well, I’m glad you asked, and the Victorian health minister, Martin Foley, has some answers for you: So, today’s locally-acquired case is directly linked to the Stratton Finance workplace, and like many of these cases we are currently managing, this person was quarantining securely during their entire infectious period. Merlino finishes up his speech with a congratulations ... and a warning: Everyone should be absolutely proud of what we have all achieved together. But we know this isn’t over yet, and until we have widespread vaccination across Victoria and across our country, the virus will still be with us. So we can’t let complacency creep in, and I am asking everyone to keep doing the right thing. Follow the rules, check-in, get tested if you are feeling unwell. You know, we are into the depths of winter now. People will get the sniffles. Any symptoms, any symptoms, please go and get tested. That is the most important thing you can do, and if you are eligible, please get vaccinated. We are making some big steps today, we are announcing some big steps. This is a good day. Oh, and there is some extra business supports announced for the Victorian businesses that have missed out in this round of restrictions easing. Merlino: In terms of business support, with the restrictions easing for Melbourne, but I have just outlined, we know that some businesses, so, for Melbourne, like gyms, amusement parks, dance studios and nightclubs, they will need to remain closed for a little while longer stop that is why I am announcing a further $8.36 million to provide an additional $2000 grant to support thousands of businesses eligible for the business cost assistance program that remain closed under the restrictions that I am announcing today. Merlino foreshadows stricter QR code check-in requirements to come: Another thing that I want to put on people’s radar is in regards to QR codes. On the advice of the chief health officer, we will be moving to make QR check-ins compulsory for all workplaces, with very limited exemptions. Previously it has only been mandatory for customer-facing services, but through this outbreak we have seen a number of cases occur in office settings, so we want to take the next step on this. We will be looking to consult with industry over the next few days around implementation and we will finalise the details next week ahead of the requirements coming into effect. The acting premier has said that, if all goes to plan, the travel restrictions barring people in Melbourne moving around the rest of the state will be eased from next Thursday night. Merlino: We will have more to say about what the next stages of easing will look like next week, but I want to assure people that are subject to the public health advice, the epidemiological conditions through the next week, we expect to be, next Thursday night, that the original Metro divisions will come down and we will be able to travel more freely around the state again. For Melbourne, we will be looking to further ease restrictions on venues, community sport will be able to come back for competition, so again, this allows local sporting clubs to start planning for what the weekend after next looks like. We want to see what more can be done to further ease restrictions safely on businesses, without jeopardising the gains we have made, and we will be looking again to make some further changes for regional Victoria. Here is what will be changing from 11.59pm Thursday for regional Victoria. Merlino: The changes include visitors to homes, so that is limited to two adults per day, plus their dependents. Public gatherings will be increased to 20 people. Restaurants and cafes can open to a maximum of 150 per venue for seated service, including up to 75 allowed indoors. Religious ceremonies will be capped at 15o per venue. Funerals will be limited to 75 people, while weddings will be limited to 20. Offices will remain capped at 50%. Community sport is back for all ages, both for training and for competition in regional Victoria. Finally, regional Victorians will still be able to travel around regional Victoria, Melburnians will not. Here is what will be changing from 11.59pm Thursday for Melbourne: Merlino: The five reasons to leave home will no longer apply in metropolitan Melbourne. The existing 10km limit will be increased to 25km. That means the only reasons to go further than 25km will be for work, education, caregiving or getting a vaccination. Travel into regional Victoria still remains a no go for now. We are also still not in a position to be able to have visitors in our homes, but outdoor gatherings will be increased to a maximum of 10 people. Schools will be able to resume face-to-face learning from Friday. Which is great news for teachers, staff, students and parents. Masks will no longer be required outdoors unless you cannot maintain a 1.5 metre distance, but it is important that everyone continues to wear them indoors, whether that is shopping, on the train or at work. Funerals are limited to 50 people, weddings are limited to 10. Religious ceremonies will be capped at 50 people inside. Offices will be able to return with 25% or a cap of 10, whichever is greater. But we’re still asking people to work home where they can. Restaurants and cafes can reopen for seated service with up to 100 people per venue and a maximum of 50 inside. Retail can reopen in line with density limits of one person per four square metres. Beauty therapy can also resume for treatments where masks can be worn. Community sport can return to training in metropolitan Melbourne. Auctions can happen outdoors, with a maximum of 50 people. Some entertainment venues and community facilities will also open in line with density limits and additional caps, and they are in line with the current settings in regional Victoria. The acting premier, James Merlino, is announcing the easing of restrictions for Melbourne and regional Victoria now. Today, on the advice of the chief health officer, we can announce some significant steps. So, from 11:59pm tomorrow night, metropolitan Melbourne will move to most of the same settings currently in place across regional Victoria, and regional Victoria will move further towards further easing Australia’s most populous state capitals Melbourne and Sydney have plummeted down the list of the world’s most liveable cities. The Economist Intelligence Unit’s survey for 2021 rated Auckland, New Zealand as the most liveable city across the globe, ahead of Osaka, Japan, reports AAP. Melbourne had basked in the title for seven years and was in second place the last time the list was compiled in 2019. The Victorian city has now dropped to eighth, behind both Adelaide (third) and Perth (sixth), after enduring the nation’s longest Covid-19 lockdown last year. Brisbane has also entered the top 10. Despite enjoying some of the most relaxed restrictions across the nation, Sydney dropped from third to 11th in a similar dive to Melbourne. The index gave Melbourne 100% in infrastructure and education, while its healthcare (83.3) and culture and environment ratings (88.2) fell. Here is the top 10 list as it now stands (Don’t worry the numbering confuses me too): * 1. Auckland, New Zealand * 2. Osaka, Japan * 3. Adelaide, Australia * 4. Wellington, New Zealand * 4. Tokyo, Japan * 6. Zurich, Switzerland * 8. Geneva, Switzerland * 8. Melbourne, Australia * 10. Brisbane, Australia Okay, we are just standing by now from Victorian acting premier James Merlino to step up now. I swear, politicians have a bad reputation for being disingenuous and talking around the questions, but they have nothing on professional sports people. Say what you mean, Buckley! Say what you mean! No Covid-19 for NSW by the way! Ummmmm is it just me or is this... good graphic design choices from Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk? I need to go buy a lotto ticket, this is clearly a very special day. Ben Roberts-Smith will take the stand this morning in his defamation trial against three Australian newspapers who have accused him of war crimes. His trial will stay behind closed doors initially before the Victoria Cross recipient takes the stand in open court to give evidence about what he saw and did in Afghanistan. He is expected to answer questions about his actions on deployment with the SAS in Afghanistan. The newspapers have accused him of committing six murders, on five separate occasions, while on deployment. The first two days of the trial opening this week has heard from Roberts-Smith’s barrister, Bruce McClintock, who has sought to impugn those who have made allegations against Roberts-Smith as “fabulists” and “failed soldiers”. McClintock told the court: “[Roberts-Smith] has never killed anyone outside the rules of engagement ever. But before Roberts-Smith’s defamation trial begins day three, a parallel legal action he is bringing, suing his ex-wife Emma Roberts over alleged access to emails and other information, is also set to be heard before a different judge. Roberts-Smith claims his former wife had access to his email - and may have disclosed to others - confidential, sensitive or privileged material. Roberts-Smith, 42, is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times for defamation over a series of reports published in 2018 which he alleges are defamatory because they portrayed him as someone who “broke the moral and legal rules of military engagement” and committed war crimes, including murder. Roberts-Smith, a decorated former corporal in the SAS, has consistently denied the allegations as “baseless”, saying they were “completely without any foundation in truth”. Collingwood CEO Mark Anderson appears to be eulogising Nathan Buckley while sitting right next to Nathan Buckley. It’s all very awkward. Looking at the next three to five years. As those conversations unfolded and particularly over the last couple of weeks and the last few days with Graham and Nathan, it became clear that Nathan’s time as coach would finish this year and that we wouldn’t be going on into 2022. We will find the right time to honour and respect his amazing legacy to the club. He is a towering figure and legend of the club and we will respect that and provide our members and fans that opportunity of respecting that as well. We know all of our people and particularly our players will be doing their very best for Bucks and our club on Monday but it will be the last time that Bucks will be leading our players and our club on Monday afternoon. OK, the Zoom call Collingwood press conference about Nathan Buckley stepping down is starting now. A brilliant photo essay out today from Alana Holmberg. Super duper worth checking out on your morning coffee break! Speaking of pressers, we will be hearing from the acting premier, James Merlino, at 11.30am today where he is expected to confirm Melbourne will come out of lockdown from Friday. (With a number of restrictions still in place.) Nathan Buckley is to stand down as Collingwood coach midway through the AFL season as the club continues its large scale structural reform. A press conference has been called for 11am at which Buckley is expected to confirm his exit, having told the club’s football department and playing staff earlier this morning. Buckley’s last game in charge is expected to be against Melbourne at the SCG on the Queen’s birthday on Monday. Buckley, who has been in charge of the Pies since taking over from Mick Malthouse in 2012, becomes the second of Collingwood’s major figureheads to leave the club this year, following the departure of former president Eddie McGuire. It brings to an end months of speculation about his future, following a disappointing start to the season which has seen his side win just three games from 12 outings. The Pies currently sit 16th on the ladder. It is unclear who will take over the job on an interim basis, but he counts his assistants as Brenton Sanderson, Robert Harvey, Hayden Skipworth and Damian Carroll. Important news from Europe. Now I know nothing about AFL (or any sport in general), but luckily the fantastic Guardian Australia sports editor Mike Hytner will drop-in in a second and bring you all the important news about Collingwood coach Nathan Buckley reportedly stepping down. By the way, we are still waiting for a time to be confirmed for this Victorian press conference. I’ll let you know as soon as we know! (Seems like the acting premier is still deep in discussion this morning as he is MIA in parliament.) Whoops, looks like the Victorian Liberals have no plans on easing up the attacks on the Andrews government today. The Australian Medical Association is backing a digital coronavirus vaccination certificate for Australians vaccinated against coronavirus. People who have had both doses of Pfizer or AstraZeneca are able to access proof through their Medicare account, reports Matt Coughlan from AAP. Australian Medical Association president Omar Khorshid told ABC radio on Wednesday that allowing immunisation status to be shown on a screen without disclosing other private health information was a logical step. Australians need to be able to prove they are vaccinated one way or another... It’s going to be needed for international travel. It may well be needed in many workplaces. Yes, we do support a mechanism for you to demonstrate your vaccine status. The certificate has a coat of arms hologram and includes the person’s name, date of birth and a green tick of validity. No one will be required to share information about non-Covid vaccinations or other health data. Proof of immunisation is seen as vital to relaxing restrictions long term, with some businesses and political leaders floating it as an incentive to receive jabs. The government services minister, Linda Reynolds, said the new record would make it simple for people to show their vaccination status. The Covid-19 digital certificate makes proof of vaccination accessible anytime, anywhere. The certificate can be accessed through the Medicare app or online through myGov. Just a quick shout out to the artist whose artwork is featured in the header photo of the blog today. The piece is called “Spatial deconstruction #23 (resilience)“, so a fairly fitting photo for today’s news, and it’s by the fantastic Emma Coulter. If you are keen to see more of her work she has a super bright and fun Instagram page here. The Victorian truth and justice commission, the Yoo-rrook Justice Commission has named Dunghutti man Josh Smith as its inaugural CEO. The Yoo-rrook Justice Commission, announced in March, is preparing to conduct an inquiry into the ongoing effects of violent dispossession and genocide as part of the process to get to Treaty in Victoria. Commissioners have already been named. Smith is a career public servant — his previous roles include the deputy secretary of Aboriginal justice at the Victorian Department of Justice and Community. The announcement of his appointment said Smith would “assist the commissioners in helping them to achieve the commission’s objectives, including those related to truth-telling, educating the wider public and making recommendations for structural reform”. He starts on 21 June. If are keen to learn more about the Biloela family’s situation, and the timeline of medical care three-year-old Tharnicaa received, can I suggest this fantastic explainer from Melissa Davey and Josh Taylor: Priya Nadesalingam has become a fierce advocate for her young daughters – Tharnicaa, three, and Kopika, five, – since her family was taken from their central Queensland home in 2018 and put in detention after her and her husband’s visas had expired. Family friend Simone Cameron said Nadesalingam has had no choice but to fight for the girls, who were both born in Australia. The health of her daughters has significantly deteriorated since the family was moved to immigration detention by Border Force officials. Only allowed half an hour outside a day in the early months of detention, Tharnicaa and Kopika became vitamin D deficient and prone to repeated infections. Tharnicaa was two when her teeth were so rotten she needed surgery to have two of them removed. You can read the full timeline below: Queensland is (local) Covid-19 free as well by the way! Victoria’s acting premier, James Merlino, is expected to give a press conference mid-morning announcing that the lockdown in Melbourne will lift from midnight on Thursday. The Victorian government has not confirmed any of the conditions which will apply post-lockdown, and says it did not provide them. But it is not refuting reports in the Herald Sun which suggest that the post-lockdown conditions will include: A 25km travel limit for people in greater Melbourne to prevent people travelling to regional areas for the Queen’s Birthday long weekend. Students returning to the classroom as early as Friday. Outdoor gatherings limited to 10 people. Cafes and restaurants limited to 50 customers. Visitors to the home still banned. Gyms to remain closed. Mandatory face masks indoors. Density limits in offices. Again, these are not confirmed rules — but they appear pretty likely. It’s not clear yet how long they will remain in place. Some may be lifted after the long weekend. We’ll bring you all the official details once the announcement is made in a few hours. A Tamil asylum seeker family detained at a Christmas Island facility has had no communication with the federal government about the prospect of being sent to the US or New Zealand, reports AAP. The Murugappan family’s lawyer Carina Ford on Wednesday responded to suggestion the two countries were likely destinations, as the government continues to reject pleas they be allowed to remain in Australia. For the record we and our clients have not been approached about this by the government - we have written to the Department of Home Affairs to ask why. The family has been on the island, far off the West Australian coast, for two years after being removed by federal authorities from their home in Biloela, Queensland. The home affairs department had been threatening to send them back to Sri Lanka, despite the family’s pleas they would be targeted. On Tuesday, the home affairs minister, Karen Andrews, said “a range of resettlement options” were under negotiation. The foreign minister, Marise Payne, later expanded on that statement, saying the US and NZ were options. “I do know that the minister for home affairs, Ms Andrews, has indicated that there are two options there, and the United States and New Zealand are both in the frame,” she told Sydney radio 2GB. Vigils will be held outside the hospital in Perth on Wednesday evening, where the youngest daughter is being treated after being medically evacuated from Christmas Island, and at Sydney Town Hall on Thursday. Victoria has recorded just one new locally acquired case overnight, which the department of health has confirmed was linked to the current outbreak and was already quarantining. This absolutely bolsters the idea that Melbourne will be allowed out of lockdown from Friday. Massive mouse plague news! (The only news I care about) The NSW government will provide up to $100m in rebates to farmers purchasing the mouse control chemical zinc phosphide amid a plague of the rodent blighting rural and regional communities. NSW farmers will be offered a rebate of 50% on their purchase of zinc phosphide - which is already tax deductible - up to $10,000. This comes after the agriculture minister, Adam Marshall, had controversially focused the government’s response on getting a permit to use the currently agriculturally banned super-strong mouse killer bromadiolone. Last month the NSW government secured 5000 litres of the anti-coagulant, enough to treat about 95 tonnes of grain, to be provided to farmers for free once federal authorities approve its use. But environmentalist and the NSW Farmer’s Association were quick to express concerns about the extremely high secondary poisoning risk to native animals that comes with this poison. Unlike zinc phosphide, bromadiolone stays in a mouse’s body after death, placing all scavenger animals, such as owls, raptors, snakes, fish and even domestic pets, at risk. In a statement, Marshall said the government was also chipping in $5m to help transport zinc phosphide to Australia. Mice have been running rampant through large tracts of inland NSW and parts of southern Queensland since last year, destroying crops and causing significant damage to tonnes of stored hay and grain. In case anyone was wondering, the Victorian Liberals haven’t been totally chased out of town and were out and about again this morning. The Federal Court has ruled while most Greenpeace social media posts using energy provider, AGL’s logo next to the tagline “Australia’s greatest liability” fall under “fair dealing”, some lacked parody and therefore breached the company’s copyright. Basically ruling the environmental group has to be funnier or risk further legal action. Greenpeace launched a campaign in May while publishing a report detailing the provider’s responsibility for 8% of Australia’s carbon emissions. AGL sought an urgent injunction in the Federal Court, saying allegations of environmental wrongdoing were “unsubstantiated” and it wanted to protect its copyright, reports AAP. Greenpeace argued its use of the AGL logo should fall under “fair dealing” provisions in Australian copyright law as it is clearly satire or parody. While justice Stephen Burley agreed with the not-for-profit in his ruling on Tuesday, he said not every post was humoured enough for this to apply. The ridicule potent in the message is likely to be immediately perceived... Many would see these uses of the modified AGL logo as darkly humorous because the combined effect is ridiculous. AGL is exposed to ridicule by the use of its corporate imagery including by use of the modified AGL logo to convey a message that AGL would not wish to send. However, no satire was featured in a photo of a school student holding a poster that contained only the logo, the term “Australia’s Biggest Climate Polluter” and “Greenpeace”. That, and a handful of other social media posts and placards, did breach AGL’s copyright, Burley ruled. Greenpeace said the ruling was an affirmation that the law “is on the side of freedom of expression”, promising to continue pressuring AGL to close its coal-burning power stations by 2030. The energy giant welcomed the court’s ruling that its logo had been misused on some occasions and reiterated the case was about “the integrity of how our brand is used”. The parties will return to court on Thursday to address questions of costs and the form of injunctive relief. You can read Guardian Australia’s previous reporting on this court case here: If you were hanging out with me on the blog yesterday you might remember the (truly wild) decision from the Victorian Liberals to publish a list of questions about the Victorian premier Daniel Andrew’s March fall where he fractured his spine. There’s no point beating around the bush, it was a move that pretty clearly stoked the flames of conspiracy theories in the state and has been pretty broadly condemned. Well, now it’s time for the federal Liberals to pay the piper for their state counterparts, with the trade minister, Dan Tehan, being asked about it on ABC news breakfast this morning. Michael Rowland: You are a member of the Victorian Liberal Party, in fact a senior member of the Victorian party. What do you make of the grassy knoll conspiracy theories being circulated by the state opposition regarding the premier, Daniel Andrews’, back accident? Tehan: As I understand it, it wasn’t grassy knoll conspiracy theories. A series of questions were asked by the opposition... Look, the opposition in Victoria has the right to ask questions. That is what happens in a properly functioning democracy... Some of them I would prefer not to be asked, but they are and that is what happens in a properly functioning Liberal democracy and the Victorian opposition have the right to ask those questions... Rowland: Do you believe they are fair questions? Not if they are right. I am asking you, you are a senior member of the Victorian Liberal Party, Dan Tehan, do you believe they are fair questions? Tehan: The opposition has the right to ask questions. It is up to commentators to decide whether they are fair, whether they are not fair. They have the right to ask those questions and, can I say, I support Louise Staley asking requests as a member of the opposition in Victoria. That is what functioning Liberal parties are all about and good on Louise for asking requests as the opposition shadow treasurer. Dan Tehan is being grilled over the Biloela family’s situation after the foreign minister yesterday suggested the young family could be resettled in the UK or New Zealand rather than returning home to their rural town where the community has been protesting for years to get them back. (Take a sip of coffee for every time Tehan says “before the courts”: I saw her comments yesterday. I also know that this issue and this matter is before the courts, but [the foreign minister] has been pursuing that. Host Michael Rowland: Is there any prospect at all of this family being returned to their community in Biloela if Queensland? Tehan: Look, my understanding is that matter is before the courts, so therefore I won’t be commenting any further on it, but also my understanding is based on the comments that Marise Payne made yesterday that we are looking at other resettlement options... This is before the courts. I am not going to comment on a matter that is before the courts, so I’ll leave it there. The minister for trade, tourism and investment, Dan Tehan, is backing up the prime minister’s criticism of China this morning, discussing the need for global rules of trade. He is speaking with ABC News Breakfast now: What the PM is putting out quite clearly is that we do have a heightened strategic competition in the Indo-Pacific and it never has been a more important time for liberal democracies to get together and make sure that we are 100% becoming a rules-based order and to make sure when it comes to global trade that those global trade rules are there, that they are being adhered to and also, as with set new rules, it is bodies like the World Trade Organization that are setting those rules. It never has been a more important time to having all countries setting rules and making sure those rules are adhered to. More on ABC’s reports about today’s Melbourne lockdown announcements: We are hanging out on the blog this morning, but about 9pm last night we weren’t so sure there would even be a website to have a blog on today! Yep, let’s talk about the massive global server outage that took down most of Australia’s major news sites last night. Alex Hern and Dan Sabbagh have the details: One of the world’s biggest web outages should act as a “wake-up call” that internet infrastructure has become dangerously over-centralised and lacks resilience, security experts have warned. An unexplained configuration error at a single infrastructure provider, Fastly, which handles 10% of the world’s internet traffic, was enough to render major websites and services inoperable for almost an hour. Online businesses including Reddit, Amazon, Twitch, Spotify and Hulu were knocked offline, as was the Guardian’s website, the BBC, the New York Times, and CNN. National governments were also caught up: gov.uk was unavailable, making a host of government services inaccessible include the Covid vaccines booking site, as was the website for the White House. The affected sites all used Fastly as a content delivery network, a service intended to provide greater reliability and performance for heavily trafficked websites. You can read the full link below on our, thankfully functional, website: This hasn’t been independently confirmed by Guardian Australia but here is what the ABC is reporting will be the likely announcements on the end of Melbourne lockdown. It’s been suggested the city will move to a 25km travel bubble, with density limits in hospitality venues, and all students returning to the classroom. The ABC suggests that senior minister are meeting this morning to finalise plans so this could still change between now and the press conference. Scott Morrison is resisting international pressure to lock in more ambitious climate commitments, declaring Australia opposes setting targets for certain parts of the economy or “false deadlines for phasing out specific energy sources”. Before he sets off for the G7 summit in the UK later this week, the prime minister will use a foreign policy speech to say that “ambition alone won’t solve the problem of actually reducing emissions”. Morrison is also expected to characterise carbon border tariffs – an idea that is gathering momentum in international discussions as a way to avoid heavy-emitting industries shifting to countries with less ambitious climate commitments – as a “combative” protectionist measure. In an address to a thinktank in Perth on Wednesday, Morrison is expected to address tensions with China, saying Australia is “far from isolated” despite Beijing rolling out a series of trade actions against Australian export sectors over the past year. You can read more about Morrison’s upcoming G7 trip below: Hello, and a very good morning to you all. It’s Matilda Boseley here to take you through the news of Wednesday. First things first, we will likely get an update on the Melbourne lockdown today, with the current restrictions notionally slated to end at midnight tomorrow. Yesterday the acting premier, James Merlino, suggested that, barring any dramatic changes on Wednesday and Thursday, Melbourne was “on track” to ease restrictions at the end of the city’s second week of lockdown. We are still ... working through all the elements. It is a day-by-day, hour-by-hour analysis about how we are tracking … We remain on track to provide that easing of restrictions to all Victorians. But Merlino also flagged that this would not mean those living in the city could suddenly begin travelling around the state freely again, saying the bubble around Melbourne “will extend beyond any announcements that we will make later in the week”. This means we will be keeping a very close eye on today’s Victorian numbers, which are usually published around 9am, and I’ll bring you all the updates when the acting premier (presumably) appears before the media later this morning. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, will deliver a major foreign policy speech today ahead of a trip to the United Kingdom, where he will be a guest at the G7 meeting of world economic powers. Australia isn’t important enough to be an official member of this exclusive club, but countries like the US, Japan, Germany and the UK sometimes let us tag along like you would a younger sibling to a house party. But before Morrison jumps on a plane he will tell Perth’s USAsia Centre that regional infrastructure that comes with onerous conditions or is too expensive isn’t worth having. Projects should be high quality – and affordable. They should meet real need, and deliver sustainable economic benefits. And they should not compromise countries’ resilience or sovereignty. (We will go into detail about this later, but as usual it’s a not-so-subtle jab at China.) Well with that, why don’t we jump into the day!

Turning back asylum seekers is illegal, dangerous, &amp; oftentimes sends them back to their deaths. Seeking asylum is a right under US and international law.”</p> \n<p>Harris, who visited Mexico on Tuesday, also faced questions about her choice not to visit the US-Mexico border as part of her trip, saying that her focus was on addressing the “root causes” that prompt migrants to flee their homes.</p> \n<p>“I’m in Guatemala because my focus is dealing with the root causes of migration,” Harris told NBC’s Lester Holt. “There may be some who think that that is not important, but it is my firm belief that if we care about what’s happening at the border, we better care about the root causes and address them.”</p> \n<p>During the NBC interview, she dismissed a question on why she hadn’t yet visited the border as vice-president by responding, “and I haven’t been to Europe. And I mean, I don’t understand the point that you’re making.

On her first foreign trip as vice-president, Harris visited Guatemala on Monday. At a press conference with Guatemala’s president, Alejandro Giammattei, the former California senator spoke about investigating corruption and human trafficking in Central America and described a future where Guatemalans could find “hope at home”. But she also had a clear message that undocumented Guatemalan migrants would not find solace at the US border under the Biden administration. “I want to be clear to folks in the region who are thinking about making that dangerous trek to the United States-Mexico border,” she said. “Do not come. Do not come.” Later on Monday, Ocasio-Cortez criticized Harris on Twitter, calling her comments “disappointing to see”. “First, seeking asylum at any US border is a 100% legal method of arrival,” said the congresswoman, an influential voice on the Democratic left since her upset win in a 2018 primary and widely known as AOC. “Second, the US spent decades contributing to regime change and destabilization in Latin America. We can’t help set someone’s house on fire and then blame them for fleeing.” Several human rights groups also spoke out. Rachel Schmidtke, a Latin America advocate at the non-profit Refugees International, said: “We continue to urge the Biden administration to build policies that recognize that many Guatemalans will need to seek protection until the longstanding drivers of forced displacement are addressed and realign its message to the Guatemalan people to reflect America’s commitment to the right to seek protection internationally.” The Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project, a non-profit that works with asylum seekers, tweeted: “Kamala Harris, seeking asylum is legal. Turning back asylum seekers is illegal, dangerous, &amp; oftentimes sends them back to their deaths. Seeking asylum is a right under US and international law.” Harris, who visited Mexico on Tuesday, also faced questions about her choice not to visit the US-Mexico border as part of her trip, saying that her focus was on addressing the “root causes” that prompt migrants to flee their homes. “I’m in Guatemala because my focus is dealing with the root causes of migration,” Harris told NBC’s Lester Holt. “There may be some who think that that is not important, but it is my firm belief that if we care about what’s happening at the border, we better care about the root causes and address them.” During the NBC interview, she dismissed a question on why she hadn’t yet visited the border as vice-president by responding, “and I haven’t been to Europe. And I mean, I don’t understand the point that you’re making. I’m not discounting the importance of the border.” Speaking to reporters in Mexico City, she also pledged she would eventually visit to the border. Despite Joe Biden moving to undo Trump-era restrictions at the border, including instituting changes to the asylum process, Harris’s speech on Monday underlined a continued stance of turning back undocumented migrants. Central America has long been affected by poverty and violence, amid entrenched cycles of political instability partly caused by criminal elites. Experts contend the US has often aided oppressive regimes. Despite the litany of dangers migrants often face when traveling north, the journey is often safer than remaining at home. “People are leaving because the corrupt governments (supported by the US) have tolerated and encouraged the growth of these criminal organizations,” said Jeff Faux, the founder of the Economic Policy Institute, in an interview with USA Today. In April, according to CNN, more than 178,000 migrants arrived at the US-Mexico border, the highest one-month total in two decades.

He has been photographed holding hands with Allen, and the Australian Financial Review reported two days ago that he was seen returning to her apartment in running gear. The judge said if the deponent of the affidavit was in a personal relationship with Roberts-Smith, “I consider that should have been disclosed”. Arthur Moses, SC, acting for Roberts-Smith, said an alternative affidavit would be provided to the court. He said he was concerned by “rumour and innuendo” and said it was unusual for a judge to take media reporting into account. “Female lawyers have enough to deal with in this profession without these aspersions being put against them,” he said. Roberts-Smith’s defamation hearing has been adjourned for the day on Wednesday and will resume – with evidence from the former soldier – on Thursday. The adjournment is because of the release of new department of defence documents to both the newspapers’ and Roberts-Smith’s legal teams. Roberts-Smith’s legal team has argued before court his high-profile defamation trial may be “contaminated,” because they believe his ex-wife, Emma Roberts, had access to the former soldier’s emails and may have shared legally privileged, or national security, information. It has been argued Roberts had access to Roberts-Smith’s emails, including correspondence with his lawyers concerning the defamation proceedings, and the Afghanistan inquiry conducted by the inspector general of the ADF. Roberts-Smith has launched the legal action against his estranged former wife, seeking all the information she holds from his email account, as well as a declaration of with whom that information has been shared. Roberts has produced documents to the federal court’s Brisbane registry. It is being “safe-handed” to Sydney. Bromwich said the court needed to hear from Roberts on her access to the information. “She might say she had a right of access, there was no breach of confidence,” Bromwich. “I don’t know.” The judge also disclosed to the court he had formerly met Ben Roberts-Smith’s father, Len, in his capacity as the commonwealth director of public prosecutions, regarding a defence response to abuse taskforce, which Len Roberts-Smith, a judge and military officer, chaired.

She has drawn sharp criticism for telling migrants at the border, “do not come”. The White House has defended her comments, which advocates pointed out violated the rights of people to come to the border seeking asylum. The White House, lawmakers and voting rights advocates are still in talks with Joe Manchin, the West Virginia Democrat who has said won’t support the For the People voting rights bill. Manchin has also obstinately refused to ax the filibuster, slashing Democrats’ hopes of protecting voting rights as Republican-led states race to enact suppression laws ahead of the next elections. A bipartisan Senate review of the 6 January Capitol insurrection found that intelligence failures left police officers vulnerable. “Communications were chaotic, sporadic, and, according to many front-line officers, non-existent,” the report said. Joe Biden abandoned negotiations with Republicans on an infrastructure bill. Biden informed Republican senator Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, who has been the senate Republican liaison on infrastructure, “that the latest offer from her group did not, in his view, meet the essential needs of our country”. The president will now focus on working with a bipartisan group led by Republican senator Mitt Romney to develop a compromise package. Former Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe has won the Democratic primary to retake his old seat. The AP just called the race in his favor. McAuliffe is set to face off against Trump-backed Republican businessman Glenn Youngkin in the state’s gubernatorial election this year. The race will be closely watched. The party that holds the White House tends to lose the gubernatorial elections in Virginia – but McAuliffe bucked that trend in 2013, become the first candidate from the president’s party to win the state’s governorship in 40 years. Throughout her trip, Harris been getting questions about why she didn’t visit the US-Mexico border. She said today that she plans to, and has visited the border before. But, she said, “Let’s talk about what’s going on in the places that are causing the issue at the border,” she said. “I think it’s shortsighted for any of us who are in the business of problem-solving to suggest we’re only going to respond to the reaction as opposed to addressing the cause.” Harris also announced a $130m investment “that we are going to dedicate to the labor reform movement here in Mexico”. She and Biden, she added, “are proud of the fact that we will be the most pro-union administration”. The investment will go to help strengthen labor standards in Mexico, address worker safety and child labor, the vice-president said. Harris, who took her first foreign trip as vice-president this week to Guatemala and Mexico City, said the trip was a “success”. She was there as an emissary for the administration on immigration and the conditions at the US-Mexico border. Earlier today, she met with the Mexican president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, to discuss efforts to combat human trafficking and manage migration, as well as economic goals. Yesterday, she stirred up criticism and controversy after she told undocumented migrants to “not come” to the US. “If we are to address the issues that address the southern Border of the United States,” she said, “we have to have the ability to address the root causes of why people leave.” “I want to be very clear that the problem at the border in large part, if not entirely, stems from the problems in these countries,” she said, referring to Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and other countries that migrants are fleeing. The Senate has passed a bipartisan bill designed to boost US competitiveness with China, 68-32. The legislation includes massive investment in American semiconductor manufacturing, robotics research, quantum computing and other technology – in an effort to counter China’s rise as an economic and geopolitical power. It includes $10bn over five years to create regional tech hubs in rural areas, and it requires that iron, steel and other products used in American infrastructure projects are manufactured domestically. It’s a rare bill that was supported by both majority leader Chuck Schumer and minority leader Mitch McConnell – demonstrating that one-upping China can unite lawmakers across party lines. The bill will still need to pass through the House before it becomes law – and it may face some resistance there from lawmakers concerned that it focuses too much on investing in emerging technologies, rather than research and technology to address climate change, cybersecurity and other pressing issues. The Senate confirmed Biden’s first two judicial nominees today, with some Republican support. The appointments are the first step for Biden in working to rebalance the courts after Republicans during the Trump administration raced to appoint more than 220 conservative judges, including three supreme court justices. “I want to convey my sincere gratitude to the Senate for confirming Julien X Neals as a judge for the US district court for the district of New Jersey and Regina M Rodriguez as a judge for the US district court for the district of Colorado, both with bipartisan support,” Biden said in a statement. Biden and Democrats have made it a big priority to appoint even more nominees in the coming weeks, with the goal of confirming “the most judges by July of the first year of a president’s first term in over 50 years”, Biden said. Bill Cassidy, a Republican senator of Louisiana, was one of the members of the moderate bipartisan group working on a new infrastructure proposal. Biden spoke with him, as well as Democrats Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona today, in hopes of reaching a deal even as he travels to Europe this week for the G7 summit. “The president said that he would be in contact with members of the group by phone while in Europe,” Psaki said. A group of moderate lawmakers led Republican Mitt Romney, of Utah, had been working on an alternative bipartisan plan. Biden will keep working with this group, in hopes of getting a deal through, Psaki said. That group hopes to win over 20 centrists to back a compromised plan – one that could cost about half of Biden’s most recent $1.7tn proposal. The plan could be closer to what Biden and most Democrats have backed than the proposal that Capito brought. A major point of contention in the $928bn Republican offer that Biden rejected was that it avoided new spending by dipping into coronavirus relief funds. While Democrats would prefer to raise the corporate tax rate, Republicans have rejected the tactic. According to press secretary Jen Psaki, the president’s efforts to negotiate a bipartisan infrastructure plan that is “responsive to the country’s pressing infrastructure needs” has hit an impasse. Biden informed Republican senator Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, who has been the senate Republican liaison on infrastructure, “that the latest offer from her group did not, in his view, meet the essential needs of our country to restore our roads and bridges, prepare us for our clean energy future, and create jobs”, Psaki said in a statement. “While he was willing to reduce his plan by more than $1 trillion, the Republican group had increased their proposed new investments by only $150 billion.” Capito signaled that she didn’t have much more to offer in terms of a plan that Republicans and Democrats could get behind. “While I appreciate President Biden’s willingness to devote so much time and effort to these negotiations, he ultimately chose not to accept the very robust and targeted infrastructure package, and instead, end our discussions,” she said. Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats are also working on a plan to pass an infrastructure measure via the reconciliation process, which would circumvent the need for bipartisan agreement. Even though Senator Joe Manchin faces pressure for his refusal to back a sweeping voting bill, there was a calm atmosphere when he met with several of the US’ leading civil rights groups on Tuesday to discuss the bill. “It was entirely constructive. It wasn’t tense in the least. Look, if there was going to be a tense meeting ever, this one was set up to be that. But it wasn’t,” Damon Hewitt, the president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, told the Guardian. “This relationship that we are continuing to build is bigger, so we were committed to this not being a tense, bombthrowing meeting.” Manchin too said the meeting was constructive, though he remained unmoved. “I don’t think anybody changed positions on that. We’re just learning where everybody’s coming from,” he said. The meeting underscores the enormous power Manchin has over the future on major civil rights bills, as well as virtually every other element of the Democratic agenda. Advocates must seek a way to show Manchin the urgency of acting without alienating them from their cause. Chuck Schumer, the senate majority leader, has pledged there will be a vote on the For the People Act at the end of June. He said Tuesday there could be changes to the bill before then – a tacit acknowledgment the current bill may be unfeasible given Manchin’s objections. Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois, said Tuesday Democrats were expecting Manchin to provide a specific list of his qualms with the bill. Asked whether Manchin understood the urgent need to act on voting rights now, Hewitt said: “Urgency, I’m not sure if he connects with because he’s on a different clock. His clock is the long game.” “People may say he’s angling for this or that, what he can get for his state. Maybe some of that is true, I don’t know. But he came across as deeply principled. That he believes what he says and he says what he believes. And we may just simply disagree,” he added. Republican West Virginia Senator Shelley Moore Capito is saying that Joe Biden has ended infrastructure negotiations with Republicans. This comes after press secretary Jen Psaki said today that “the train is moving on several tracks” regarding the negotiations. Here is Capito’s statement: Actress and activist Alyssa Milano is considering running for Congress in 2024, in a bid to flip a Republican stronghold in California blue, the Hill is reporting. Milano said she splits her time between Ventura county and Truckee in California’s 4th congressional district, which has been represented by Republican Tom McClintock since he was first elected in 2008. “It’s going to take someone with, I think, name recognition and deep pockets to be able to run against McClintock, and so I’m considering it,” Milano told the Hill. “I’m basically gathering information right now, speaking to different consultants, speaking to the community.” Vice-President Kamala Harris will host all 24 female senators for dinner next week, bringing back what were once regular bipartisan get-togethers, Politico reports. The quarterly dinners were started by former Democratic Maryland Senator Barbara Mikulski and Republican Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, according to Politico, hosted at the home of a different senator every six week, with each lawmaker bringing a different dish. Supposedly, however, the dinners became less regular after Mikulski retired in 2017 - and with the aggressive campaigning against former Republican New Hampshire Senator Kelly Ayotte in 2016 and Republican Maine Senator Susan Collins in 2020. Adding to tensions, in 2020, a record four femaleDemocratic senators were running against each other for president - Harris, New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren. “The sisterhood has certainly faded,” an unnamed source told Politico. It’s been a lively morning and we have more news to bring you in the coming hours, so do stay tuned. Here are the main developments of the day in US political news so far. Vice president Kamala Harris is coming in for some criticism from progressives and others both on the likely effectiveness of her visit to Guatemala and Mexico this week and attempts to tackle the “root causes” of migration from the region to the US, and her blunt message yesterday aimed at migrants telling them simply: “Do not come”. White House press sec Jen Psaki defended Harris at the briefing today. The White House is still putting a brave face on the gut-punch by Joe Manchin in his West Virginia op-ed saying he wouldn’t support either the For the People voting rights Act legislation stuck in Congress or busting the filibuster to get more Biden bills through. Psaki said folks were encouraged by talks today between Manchin and civil rights leaders. This despite those talks not yielding any concrete agreement, compromise or shift in positions, apparently. The first – and possibly the last – bipartisan review into the 6 January insurrection at the US Capitol uncovered failings on all fronts before the attack as well as breakdowns between intelligence agencies and a lack of preparation by the Capitol police. White House press secretary Jen Psaki received multiple questions about Vice-President Kamala Harris and her first foreign trip. To recap, Harris has received some criticism for bluntly telling migrants “do not come” to the US and then for not visiting the border. Psaki reiterated that Harris’s assignment “was to work with countries and leaders within the northern triangle to address root causes, to address corruption, to make sure we’re working together to address humanitarian concerns.” “I think at some point she may go to the border, we’ll see,” Psaki said. “But she’s in the northern triangle now to have discussions with leaders, with community leaders, with civil society leaders, with the embassy on how we can work together.” Psaki acknowledged a critical tweet from progressive Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez that pointed out that seeking asylum at the US border is “a 100% legal method of arrival”. “What the vice president was simply conveying is that there’s more work to be done, that we don’t have these systems in place yet, that it’s still a dangerous journey, as we’ve said many times from here and from many forums before,” Psaki said. “We need more time to get the work done to get asylum processing to where it should be.” Much of the backlash over Harris’s comments over not visiting the border have come from Republicans. Psaki addressed this, saying, “we’re not taking advice from former President Trump, or most of the Republicans who are criticizing us on this, given that they were all sitting there while we created this problem that we walked into at the border and the movement of migration that has been growing in the last year,” she said. A reporter asked about some progressives referring to Joe Manchin as the “new Mitch McConnell”. Jen Psaki responded: “We’ll leave the name-calling to others.” In today’s White House press briefing, White House press secretary Jen Psaki was asked about voting rights legislation, in light of senator Joe Manchin and his weekend oped about his decision not to vote for the For The People Act. In response to a question about whether Joe Biden would push for pursuing the John Lewis Act before the For The People Act, she responded, “I think he is quite open to what Democratic leadership feels is the viable path forward.” She followed up by saying it was “encouraging” to see Manchin meet with civil rights leaders this morning, and reiterated the administration’s support for voting rights legislation. “We will continue to press for federal action to move forward on a bill that the president would love to sign into law,” Psaki said. “We certainly know we cannot do that with a magic wand, that is not how democracy works, for good reason. But the president also signed this executive action early on, a very expansive and powerful executive action, because he didn’t want to delay a moment in ensuring that we were taking more steps to assist states to modernize vote.gov, to increase federal employees’ access to voting, to analyze barriers to voting for people.” West Virginia senator Joe Manchin left his meeting with civil rights leaders unmoved on his decision to oppose the sweeping For the People Act, but called the conversation constructive. “We had a constructive conversation. I think everybody pretty much knows the importance of what we’re doing,” Manchin said. “And I think I’m very much concerned about our democracy, protecting people’s voting rights.” Civil rights leaders that met with Manchin - NAACP President Derrick Johnson, the Rev Al Sharpton, National Urban League President Marc Morial, National Council of Negro Women President Johnnetta Cole, Lawyers’ Committee President Damon Hewitt, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights interim President Wade Henderson and the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation President Melanie Campbell - were measured in their response. The readout from the meeting read: In a very constructive meeting today, national civil rights leaders met with Senator Manchin to share our policy priorities and concerns related to voting rights and police reform. Specifically, the groups expressed their collective views on the need for Congress to pass both the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, and the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. The two voting rights bills are a top priority and essential to protect the freedom to vote. There continues to be an unprecedented partisan wave of state legislative proposals that are aimed at denying the right to vote — particularly for Black and Brown people. The leaders also conveyed to Senator Manchin that a minority of senators must not be able to abuse the filibuster to impede much needed progress. Congress must act so all Americans have meaningful access to the ballot. Vice-President Kamala Harris, who has been taking some criticism for her blunt speech in Guatemala to Central American migrants to “do not come” to US, is now getting some backlash from Republicans for an NBC interview she did on this same trip. Reminder: Joe Biden tasked Harris in March with efforts to stem migration at the US-Mexican border. On her first foreign trip, NBC’s Lester Holt asked if she had any plans to visit the border. “At some point, you know, we are going to the border,” Harris said. “We’ve been to the border. So this whole, this whole, this whole thing about the border. We’ve been to the border. We’ve been to the border.” “You haven’t been to the border,” Holt responded. “I, and I haven’t been to Europe. And I mean, I don’t - I don’t understand the point that you’re making,” Harris said with a laugh. Harris has maintained that her focus is on “the root causes of migration.” “I care about this and I care about what’s happening at the border. I’m in Guatemala because my focus is dealing with the root causes of migration,” Harris said. “There may be some who think that that is not important, but it is my firm belief that if we care about what’s happening at the border, we better care about the root causes and address them.” Vice-President Kamala Harris is in Mexico now, meeting with Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador. Reminder that the Senate report on the Capitol attack comes just weeks after Republicans blocked efforts to establish a bipartisan, 9/11-style commission to investigate the events of 6 January. The first – and possibly the last – bipartisan review into the 6 January attack on the US Capitol uncovered failings on all fronts before the attack as well as breakdowns between intelligence agencies and a lack of preparation by the Capitol police. “This report is important in the fact that it allows us to make some immediate improvements to the security situation here in the Capitol,” said Michigan senator Gary Peters, the chairman of the homeland security and governmental affairs committee, which conducted the investigation along with the Senate rules committee. “But it does not answer some of the bigger questions that we need to face, quite frankly, as a country and as a democracy.” Read more about the report’s findings here: Joseph Blount Jr, president and CEO of the Colonial Pipeline Company, is testifying before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee about the ransomware attack last month that knocked out gas delivery up and down the East Coast. The Justice Department announced yesterday that it recovered $2.3m of the roughly $4.4m that the company paid in a cryptocurrency ransom to a gang of criminal hackers known as DarkSide. It appears the meeting between Joe Manchin and civil rights leaders has come to an end. In more voting rights news: following the Sunday oped in which Democratic senator Joe Manchin committed against voting for the For The People Act, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is saying the House will move on the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. Some recap: the For The People Act would ensure automatic and same-day registration, place limits on gerrymandering and restore voting rights for felons. The John Lewis Act, named after the late Georgia Democratic congressman, would reauthorize voting protections established in the civil rights era but eliminated by the supreme court in 2013. Manchin said he would support the John Lewis Act. His major concern with the For The People Act is that it was not bipartisan. Pelosi made clear that the John Lewis Act is not a substitute for the For The People Act. Former President Barack Obama went on CNN last night to criticize how Republicans have been “cowed into accepting” a series of positions that “would be unrecognizable and unacceptable even five years ago or a decade ago”. In an interview with Anderson Cooper, Obama spoke of the 6 January attack on the US Capitol: “Suddenly you have large portions of the elected Congress going along with the falsehood that there were problems with the election.” He expressed disappointment in Republican elected officials, saying that he understood that while it was politically difficult to go against the lies and conspiracy theories being peddled among their base, it was the right thing to do. “I didn’t expect that there would be so few people who would say, ‘I don’t mind losing my office because this is too important. America is too important. Our democracy is too important’,” Obama said. “We didn’t see that.” “I’m still the hope and change guy,” Obama said. “My hope is the tides will turn, but that does require each of us to understand that this experiment in democracy is not self-executing. It doesn’t happen just automatically. It happens because each successive generation says ‘these values, these truths, we hold self-evident. This is important. We’re going to invest in it and sacrifice for it, even when it’s not politically convenient’.” Vice-President Kamala Harris travels to Mexico today to meet with the country’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador. But Harris is already drawing some criticism on her first official foreign trip. In Guatemala yesterday, Harris was blunt in telling would-be migrants “do not come” to the US border. Her spokeswoman, Symone Sanders, appeared to try to soften that statement today: The Guardian’s Julian Borger looks into some other questions raised by the measures Harris announced in Guatemala: Hello, live blog readers. Hope you’re all doing well. Two days after publishing an op ed on why he won’t vote for voting rights legislation for which he was a key vote, Democratic West Virginia senator Joe Manchin will meet with critics on the left today. Black and civil rights leaders have long fought against what many Democrats have categorized as Republican efforts to restrict voter access in communities of color. And they’re not happy. Manchin’s decision leave Democrats scrambling on what to do next on the For the People Act, which would ensure automatic and same-day registration, place limits on gerrymandering and restore voting rights for felons. It comes as Joe Biden said he would “fight like heck” for voting protections, putting Vice-President Kamala Harris in charge of the White House’s efforts.

Here we bring together the latest figures to track the progress of the rollout, as well as presenting an interactive tool to show when you might be eligible to receive the vaccine. Vaccine rollout One of the biggest logistical exercises in Australia’s history, the delivery of coronavirus vaccines to more than 20 million people has begun. The government was hoping to have 4 million people vaccinated by March and the entire country inoculated by October. Here, you can see the current rate of vaccination compared with the rate of doses we would have needed to meet the government’s goals for the early stages of the rollout, with the initial goal of 60,000 doses in the first week followed by 4m doses by the end of March. This assumes a linear rate of increase, but it’s quite likely the speed of vaccinations will ramp up as the rollout proceeds: The vaccine rollout is not uniform across Australia, as the state and federal governments have divided the task between them. The following chart shows how many doses have been administered per 100 people in each jurisdiction. Note that the Australian rollout rate is higher than the sum of the state rates as vaccinations in GP clinics and aged and disability care are counted at the federal government level. Here, you can see how Australia’s vaccine rollout compares with other countries, notably excluding Israel, which is currently leading the world in terms of the number of doses administered per 100 people: When will I get the vaccine? The timing for when you should expect to get the vaccine is dependent on who you are, how old you are and what you do for work. The government has released an interactive tool that takes into account all the factors that will determine which phase of the vaccine rollout you will be in. You can check your eligibility for the vaccine rollout using our interactive tool, which uses the government’s data: Latest coronavirus statistics Guardian Australia has gone through every state and territory press release to construct and maintain an up-to-date database of coronavirus cases, as well as maintaining live data feeds from other groups collating data.

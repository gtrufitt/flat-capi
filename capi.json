Because this Melbourne outbreak’s come out of a hotel.</p> <p><strong>SR:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We’ve seen a few issues in Victoria with hotels*. In March last year when the prime minister put together national cabinet, the states were insistent that they were to run quarantine. They’re the ones whose public health orders are being responded to. They’re the ones with the emergency services and health personnel. So it was at the states’ request that quarantine will be run out of states and territories. Now, we’re in this together. We’re working with the states and territories. There’s no criticism –</p> </blockquote> <p> * It’s been all states. The latest outbreak is linked to an Adelaide quarantine hotel.<br></p> <p>KG: [interrupts] But the prime minister is the prime minister. He’s your friend. He’s the nation’s leader. Why wouldn’t he just say ‘look, we’ve got to build this thing, we’ve got to get it done, take it out of the hotels’? It’s been said to him several times from <strong>Jane Halton</strong>, from the opposition, from everyone concerned yet it hasn’t been done.</p> <p><strong> SR:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The states and territories are still keen to continue to operate it. Now, at the same time …</p> </blockquote> <p> KG: [interrupts] Override them.</p> <p><strong> SR:<br></strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> … over the same time – well, you’ve seen the constitutional powers and the limit of them with trying to keep state borders open and our inability to do that because the states are supreme in their own states.</p> </blockquote> <p>KG: But they’re now saying they want you to build one in northern Victoria, one in Toowoomba. Why is the government not jumping all over this?</p> <p><strong>SR: </strong><br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>So, we’ve expanded Howard Springs to 2,000. We’re going through with Victoria now in a very good proposal from Victoria, as the prime minister has said. And the issue in Toowoomba, of course, is we don’t have the details from the Queensland state government. Now, if they gave us all of the detail in the same vein that Victoria has, it may be a different discussion. But we’re working very constructively with Victoria on their proposal.</p> </blockquote> <p>KG: Do you see why some, including the opposition, are saying that the government’s been sitting on its hands on this issue? It’s not like this proposal of getting the quarantine out of hotels hasn’t been around for some months now.</p> <p><strong>SR:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> Again, we are working with the states and territories, and they were the ones that wanted to run quarantine. Now, states are now coming forward with alternative proposals, and the Victorian one’s a great case in point. We’re working really constructively with them.</p> </blockquote> <p>KG:</p> <p>So does the PM say at the election campaign to people if there’s a massive outbreak, look, it was the states’ fault? Is that where we get to?</p> <p><strong>SR:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> Well, national cabinet was all about being in this together and doing this together. The decision was made together that states and territories would run quarantine. Now the opposition is saying that it’s not good enough the states and territories are running quarantine. And they’re criticising their state and territory colleagues, which I think is a bit harsh. States and territories are doing their best and they’re having a good crack at this.</p> </blockquote> <p> KG:<br></p> <p> I think they’re criticising you, to be fair. They’re criticising your government.</p> <p><strong>SR</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> <strong>Well, they’re saying we should take it over because they’re saying the states are failing.

A shouting match ensued.</p> <p>The hearing earlier revealed that <strong>Jane Prentice</strong>, a former Liberal minister, was appointed in February to the AAT, a body that reviews government decisions, while still working for Counsel House, a lobbying firm. </p> <p>Full-time AAT members must seek approval from the president before taking on other paid work. Carr asked if that approval had been sought and obtained.</p> <p>The AAT officials couldn’t answer the question and took it on notice. Attorney general <strong>Michaelia Cash</strong> was asked when she first became aware of the matter. She replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I am aware of it now, Senator Carr, because you’ve just raised it, and it has been taken on notice by the registrar to provide you with more information.</p> </blockquote> <p>Carr also questioned the AAT members about the number of part-time members who either have not finished a case or not worked a single day since being appointed.<br></p> <p>There were 29 members who had not finalised a case in 2018-19, 18 members in 2019-20, and 18 members in 2019-20.

ARA CEO Paul Zahra said the seven-day lockdown is set to cost over a billion dollars in terms of lost retail trade. “We support the Victorian Government in their response to keep the community safe, but we can’t ignore the significant impact this lockdown will have on retailers, the Melbourne CBD and small businesses in particular,” Mr Zahra said. “Victorians have been to hell and back over the past year or so, and just when we thought the worst of Covid was behind us, it’s reared its head again mid-year. “Businesses no longer have JobKeeper support payments available to them and Victorian small businesses in particular will be under significant stress – this is a huge blow to their confidence. “A seven-day lockdown is expected to cost retailers over a billion dollars in terms of lost trade. This isn’t just a financial cost – it’s a social one as well. This lockdown will have an enormous impact on people’s health and wellbeing and will shatter fragile confidence levels for the second half of the year. This will also set back the valiant efforts of State and local government to restore confidence and foot traffic within Melbourne’s hard-hit CBD. “Online, click and collect and home delivery is still available in Victoria and we encourage people to use those options for getting the goods and services they need. “Most retailers have an online sales platform, so if there’s items you would normally buy in store - check out the online purchase, collection and delivery options they might have.” The ARA has called for focused efforts to bolster vaccinations and improve contact tracing within Victoria, along with targeted support to continue for small business and Melbourne’s CBD in light of this major set-back. How long until Victorians can see the impacts of the lockdown? Brett Sutton: Some of it will be immediate in the sense that people who are close contacts now will not have 100 close contact themselves. They will have three, four, five and that does make a difference. The real effects are still a few days away and it is fair to say that of the 24 cases we have got so far all of that transmission occurred before we knew about the first case, essentially, so this is the time for the lockdown. This is the time when all of those exposed individuals who might now be becoming infected US from now onwards - we just want to limit their movements. Brett Sutton says Victoria could probably do 30,000 vaccines a day “easily” and the primary care system - GPs - could do even more. He says if Victoria could get to 100,000 a day “that would be great” Was consideration given for people who are fully vaccinated not to go into lockdown? Brett Sutton: There is no question that getting vaccinated and been two weeks after your first vaccine gives you a level of protection. One vaccine is not enough, but even for those who are poorly vaccinated and 12-14 days post at the second vaccine, it is problematic until we have clear directive from a national standard. The lockdown starts at 11.59pm tonight. Where you are tonight should be where you are for the full week of lockdown. But don’t go rushing to a new residence if you don’t have to. James Merlino says Daniel Andrews supports the lockdown: I spoke to the premier this morning and yesterday as well – his recovery is going well. This was a nasty incident -– fractured ribs, fractured vertebrae, very lucky. A very nasty injury and a long recovery. Anyone who has had a major back injury knows the duration, the pain of that recovery, but he is going well. He is walking. He put out a statement a little while ago that he hopes to be back in June. That will be subject to his doctor’s advice, but he is going well. But why is Victoria going into its fourth lockdown? James Merlino: Across the country, we have had breaches out of hotel quarantine across the country. We have had community transmission across the world. This is a global pandemic where millions and millions of people have died. We are not unique. Where we are unique is the work we did last year, all Victorians, in defeating the second wave. We need to deal with the reality of this outbreak that originated as of a hotel breach in SA. We need to deal with a reality that a vast majority of our community in this country are not vaccinated, and that means that we need to have these circuit-breaker lockdowns. Asked why no other state has gone through this like Victoria has, James Merlino says: We are continually improving how we respond to the pandemic and I go back to the work that our contact tracers have been doing with this particular outbreak that originated from a hotel quarantine breach in SA. As Professor Sutton and other experts have spoken about, there are others who are positive but do not shed and transmit. There are other individuals who are highly infectious. If you combine a highly infectious individual with high-risk transmission settings – bars, clubs and workplace – particular workplaces we are focused on at the moment, 10% of the workforce has returned a positive result, so when you have highly infectious people operating in a higher-risk settings, we do have transmission Should Victorians be angry at the federal government? James Merlino: It helps no one if I am just standing here blaming circumstances or blaming individuals or governments … It is a fact that the commonwealth vaccine rollout has been delayed and there are global reasons for that delay. You have to supply, procure and deliver and we have seen a delay. We have also seen a reluctance from some people to get vaccinated when they are eligible, so it is a fact that we have aged care facilities where not one person has been vaccinated. These are facts. We need to get this vaccination rolled out as quickly as possible, and that is why we have been doing a lot of work about how we can quickly expand what we offer at our state sites and that is why I am pleased that we have been in a position through Martin and his department that we can deliver the Pfizer vaccine for 40- to 49-year-olds. Despite the booking problems, Victoria’s health minister says people do need to book for Pfizer (if they are eligible) because of supply issues: With the nature of the Pfizer of vaccine, we do require people who are eligible, now 40- to 49-year-olds to book, and we ask you to do that through the phone system. In regards to the AstraZeneca which is in the ... pharmacies and with primary healthcare providers, you would need to book with your GP. We would encourage you to either phone or walk up if you are over 50 for the AstraZeneca. So under 50 – book. Over 50 – you can walk in. More on the vaccine expansion in Victoria just announced by the acting premier. The commonwealth’s Covid-19 vaccination program will again expand in Victoria to include everyone aged 40 years and over from tomorrow, Friday 28 May. It means more than half of all Victorians will be eligible to receive either the Pfizer or AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccines. Victorians aged 40 to 49 years will be able to access to the Pfizer vaccine at state-run vaccination sites. People aged 40 to 49 years receiving the Pfizer vaccine must book an appointment by calling the Coronavirus Hotline on 1800 675 398 – and can do so now – this is essential as not all vaccination centres will have the Pfizer vaccine available. Victorians aged 50 years and over will continue to receive the AstraZeneca vaccine, either through a state-run vaccination centre or a participating GP clinic. While many vaccination centres are accepting walk-in appointments for people aged 50 years and over, bookings via the 1800 675 398 hotline are preferred. Since launching the first high-volume vaccination centres, the state-run program has expanded rapidly to more than 30 hubs across metropolitan Melbourne and regional Victoria. Victoria has experienced record demand this week for vaccinations and forward bookings.

For more information on the commonwealth’s Covid-19 vaccination program, visit health.vic.gov.au. Brett Sutton gets very cranky when he’s asked what has gone wrong with Victoria’s Covid contact tracing, given that this is the fourth lockdown: That is absurd. To finish, it is an absurd proposition that contact tracing has gone wrong. We have talked about exactly what the contact tracing team have done here and it is extraordinary. Contact tracing is an integral part of how to get control. It does not do magic. Every country in the world started with one or two cases in their countries. Brett Sutton says contact tracers have seen this many primary and secondary contacts this soon before: We haven’t seen that number previously. Part of the reason for the big numbers we’ve seen is there were generations of transmission that occurred before the first case was identified to us. There’s been opportunities to spread to people. The other clear is element is the infectiousness of the virus. When we see a member become infected, almost all the household is infected. It speaks to the infectiousness of this B161 variant, but also the cycles it’s going through. It really is rapid and that’s led to the exponential increase. Victoria’s chief health officer Prof Brett Sutton says the lockdown is necessary, given the number of exposures: I do think we have to ready ourselves for seven days of this lockdown. With, as the acting premier said, thousands of primary and secondary close contacts. They are individuals who have been exposed – any one of them could become cases over the next 14 days from their exposure. So we really just need to see each and every day what new cases might emerge, hopefully, all of the positives will be they have been contacted, they’re in quarantine already, and that when they test positive, there’s no new exposure sites generated. So the things to watch are the new cases that I’m sure will occur but whether or not they’re out and about in the community, whether there’s new exposure sites that are putting others at risk. So they’re the things to watch. It would be great if the new cases I do expect, that they have – they’re amongst those 10,000 primary and secondary close contacts and there aren’t new exposure sites generated. Are vaccine supply concerns the reason the vaccination program hasn’t been opened to everyone? James Merlino: We have a number of reasons why the commonwealth’s vaccine rollout has been delayed. And it has been delayed. That is a fact. It should – we should be at a much higher level, in terms of the number of people vaccinated than today. These are supply issues the commonwealth is responsible for, securing, procuring, and then delivering the supply, so that’s been one of problems. And of course the changes that were announced in regards to AstraZeneca had a hit on public confidence, but the third element is people have got to be willing to be vaccinated. As the minister for health, professor Sutton and other public health experts say, these vaccines are safe. And these vaccines, if people get vaccinated, it keeps our community safe. We would not be in this position that we are today, this necessary and difficult position, that we are today, if our vaccination rates were much higher than they are right now. James Merlino says he knows this will be tough for business and events given that it is the first lockdown since the end of jobkeeper, but he says the Victorian government is looking at support. He does not go into detail about what form that support will take. Will Victorians have to keep living with the threat of lockdown? James Merlino: Well, you go to last year, it was about defeating the second wave and ensuring we don’t have a third wave. But there’s only – there’s only one path to defeating this pandemic, and the successful rollout of the commonwealth’s vaccine program, and an alternative to hotel quarantine, particularly for those who are very, very high risk. Until we get to that point, until we have successfully rolled out the commonwealth’s vaccine program, and we’re stepping up where we can, the announcement we’re making today to extend the eligibility for people who can get a vaccine, from the priority cohorts to now anyone over 40, is what we can do to make sure we get there. But this is the commonwealth’s vaccine program, they’re responsible for supply, right now, we’ve got the supply we need, and that’s why we’re making the call to everyone. No one – no one wants to be where we are today. But this is highly infectious, and it is running at a super quick pace. Is Victoria confident in its contact tracers? James Merlino: They’re doing an extraordinary work. I just go back to what I said in my opening remarks, our contact tracers, within a 24-hour period, are identifying and locking down first, second and third rings of cases. They have never ever worked as hard, as fast, and as effectively as they are right now. But despite that, this variant is moving at a faster pace. So, our contact tracers are doing a brilliant job but we need to get on top of this. That’s why we have advice from public health, given the circumstances, more than 10,000 primary and secondary contacts, more than 150 exposure sites right across the state of Victoria, Bendigo, on our border, right across metropolitan Melbourne, we need to have this circuit-breaker lockdown. We know it works. We know it makes a difference. We’ve done this before. Victorians know what to do. But the contact tracers are working more quickly than they have ever done before. The vaccine booking line for 40- to 49-year-olds in Victoria has already crashed: More testing sites are being set up around Victoria today. There are about 196 of them. On the vaccine program in Melbourne: The ACTU has responded to the lockdown: The Victorian lockdown will be the first to extend beyond a weekend since the Morrison Government prematurely ended the JobKeeper wage subsidy at the end of March, despite an uneven recovery and a failing vaccine rollout which meant that additional lockdowns were likely. A lockdown with no support for jobs, especially those in sectors like hospitality, retail and aviation which are still struggling to recover from the pandemic, means many workers face an uncertain future with no guaranteed connection to work. The Morrison Government bears clear responsibility both for this lockdown, caused by a combination of its lack of action on national quarantine standards and inability to efficiently distribute the vaccine, and for any job losses resulting from its short-sighted decision to end JobKeeper for all. James Merlino then pleads for people who can get vaccinated, to do so – and also pleads with the federal government to move forward with a proper quarantine facility: I can announce that from tomorrow morning, vaccinations at state sites will be expanded to include those in the 40- to 49-year-old age group, for the Pfizer vaccine, so that means now, if our state sites, if you’re over 40, you will eligible for a vaccine. So we need you to call the hotline, we need you to make a booking. In terms of GPs, that will be a decision of the commonwealth, but in terms of the state sites that we run, we’ll be expanding it to 40 to 49, so I really encourage everyone, if you’re eligible, get vaccinated. The reason why we are dealing with this outbreak today is because of a hotel breach in South Australia. That is not a criticism, it is just a fact, we have had breaches in hotel quarantine right around our country. The only way through this pandemic is everyone getting vaccinated as quickly as you are eligible, and for the commonwealth to agree to an alternative quarantine arrangement, particularly for high-risk individuals and, in this case, we’re talking about a variant of concern. If we had – if we had an alternative to hotel for this particular variant of concern, we would not be here today. If we had the vaccine, the commonwealth’s vaccine program effectively rolled out, we may well not be here today, talking about these circuit-breaker restrictions that we must impose to keep our community safe. James Merlino is going through some of the rules: For shopping and exercise, you need to stay within 5km of your home, unless your nearest shops are further away. Masks must be worn everywhere, indoors and outdoors, anywhere other than your home, unless an exemption applies. There are to be no visitors to your home other than an intimate partner. Single bubbles will be permitted. If you live alone, you can make a bubble with another person. And there’s to be no public gatherings. In terms of what remains open, so restaurants, pubs, and cafes can provide takeaway only. Essential retail, so supermarkets, food stores, petrol stations, banks, bottle shops and pharmacies, other retail stores can provide click and collect. Childcare and kinders will be open as per the last circuit-breaker lockdown earlier this year. Approved professional sporting events will proceed but proceed without crowds. Authorised workers and workplaces – in terms of what will be closed or changed, schools will move to remote learning, except for vulnerable children, and children of authorised workers. Higher education will move to remote learning only. Community support and recreation, accommodation, but there will be some exemptions that apply. Hotels, clubs, TABs and the casino will be closed, indoor and outdoor entertainment venues, swimming pools, spas, saunas, indoor and outdoor springs, community venues, drive-in cinemas, amusements parks, creative studios, art galleries and museums, tourism, tours, and transport, and auctions can only happen online. In terms of our health settings, aged care facilities: no visitors except for limited reasons. In our hospitals, visitors only for end of life, to support a partner during birth, or a parent accompanying a child. In terms of ceremonies, funerals: a maximum of 10 people, plus those running the service. Weddings cannot proceed unless end-of-life or deportation reasons apply. And religious activities will not proceed other than through broadcast with a maximum of five people. James Merlino says there is no other choice but to lock down the state, given the speed of the spread of this variant of the virus. Here are the reasons you can leave home: shopping for necessary goods and services authorised work or permitted education exercise – a two-hour limit, with one other person caregiving, compassionate and medical reasons and the fifth: to get vaccinated James Merlino: Our public health experts’ primary concern is how fast this variant is moving. We’ve seen overseas how difficult that movement can be to control. Here in Victoria we’re seeing not only how quick it is but how contagious it is as well. Our contact tracers identifying – are identifying and locking down the first ring, second ring and third ring within 24 hours. They have never done that before. That’s the fastest our contact tracers have ever moved within a 24-hour period, identifying and locking down first, second and third rings of cases. But despite working as fast as this – and my thanks to all of our contact tracers – this variant is moving faster still. The time between catching the virus and passing it on is tighter than ever. For some of those cases I mentioned, for some of them ... how long it takes between the onset of symptoms in the first and secondary case is averaging just over a day. Now, to put that in some perspective, the usual transmission is about five to six days. In some of these cases, within a day it’s been transmitted. The number of cases has doubled in 24 hours. Unless something drastic happens, this will become increasingly uncontrollable. The vaccine rollout has been slower than we have hoped. It’s not where we hoped it would be, it’s not where it should be. If more people were vaccinated, we might be facing a very different set of circumstances than we are today. But sadly we are not. If we make the wrong choice now, if we wait too long, this thing will get away from us. Acting premier James Merlino says one person is in ICU: We said this time yesterday the next 24 hours were going to be particularly critical in terms of what our next steps will be. To ensure we keep our state safe. In the last day, we have seen 12 linked new cases, bringing the total number of cases linked to the hotel quarantine breach in South Australia to 26. Sadly, we have one of those people in an ICU, on a ventilator, in not a very good way. In the last day, we’ve seen more evidence we’re dealing with a highly infectious strain of the virus, a variant of concern, which is running faster than we have ever recorded. There are at least 10,000 primary and secondary contacts who are being required to be isolated. Journalists at the press conference have been handed a statement with the lockdown conditions: Annnnd there has been a small earthquake in regional Victoria: For those asking why is Victoria looking at a lockdown, while NSW didn’t when it had an outbreak in the northern beaches – I’d urge you to look at the geographical spread of where people infected with Covid have visited and just how spread out exposure sites are. It’s a lot easier to contain an outbreak when people are all in the same area – like what happened with the northern beaches. The latest Melbourne outbreak has spread across the city. Queensland is being very Queensland amid all this (I can say that, as a Queenslander). Via AAP: Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk is in talks with the NRL to host the State of Origin opener in 13 days time, following a Covid-19 outbreak in Melbourne. The MCG is currently the venue for the June 9 clash, but that could change if the Victorian capital goes into lockdown from Friday, as expected. The virus cluster in Melbourne’s north expanded to 26 infections as 11 new cases diagnosed on Thursday. Premier Palaszczuk says the Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane or Queensland Country Bank Stadium in Townsville could host the clash on June 9, if needed. “We’re putting our hand up – as I know other states will as well,” Palaszczuk told parliament on Thursday. “We live in rugby league heartland. Queensland is the ideal place to kick off this year’s State of Origin. “I can confirm that we’re in discussions with the NRL.” For the record, no one is saying the states are failing and they want the federal government to “take over” quarantine. I think people just want the federal government to *do* something on quarantine, given that it is a commonwealth responsibility, we are 18 months in, our vaccine program has been delayed, we have thousands of Australians still stranded overseas, eventually we will have to open our international border and we will be living with this virus for years to come. “Fortress Australia” is, and always was, porous. And we still don’t have a plan. This exchange between Stuart Robert and Kieran Gilbert on Sky News yesterday afternoon shows you where the federal government’s attitude to this is at. This was after a question time when Scott Morrison accused Labor of blaming the states after he was questioned about the lack of purpose-built federal quarantine facilities and the slow vaccine rollout: KG: The other question that’s been put, though, is why hasn’t the government, why haven’t you and other ministers said “OK, look, we’ve got to build a purpose-built quarantine facility out of the cities, out of hotels”? Because this Melbourne outbreak’s come out of a hotel. SR: We’ve seen a few issues in Victoria with hotels*. In March last year when the prime minister put together national cabinet, the states were insistent that they were to run quarantine. They’re the ones whose public health orders are being responded to. They’re the ones with the emergency services and health personnel. So it was at the states’ request that quarantine will be run out of states and territories. Now, we’re in this together. We’re working with the states and territories. There’s no criticism – * It’s been all states. The latest outbreak is linked to an Adelaide quarantine hotel. KG: [interrupts] But the prime minister is the prime minister. He’s your friend. He’s the nation’s leader. Why wouldn’t he just say ‘look, we’ve got to build this thing, we’ve got to get it done, take it out of the hotels’? It’s been said to him several times from Jane Halton, from the opposition, from everyone concerned yet it hasn’t been done. SR: The states and territories are still keen to continue to operate it. Now, at the same time … KG: [interrupts] Override them. SR: … over the same time – well, you’ve seen the constitutional powers and the limit of them with trying to keep state borders open and our inability to do that because the states are supreme in their own states. KG: But they’re now saying they want you to build one in northern Victoria, one in Toowoomba. Why is the government not jumping all over this? SR: So, we’ve expanded Howard Springs to 2,000. We’re going through with Victoria now in a very good proposal from Victoria, as the prime minister has said. And the issue in Toowoomba, of course, is we don’t have the details from the Queensland state government. Now, if they gave us all of the detail in the same vein that Victoria has, it may be a different discussion. But we’re working very constructively with Victoria on their proposal. KG: Do you see why some, including the opposition, are saying that the government’s been sitting on its hands on this issue? It’s not like this proposal of getting the quarantine out of hotels hasn’t been around for some months now. SR: Again, we are working with the states and territories, and they were the ones that wanted to run quarantine. Now, states are now coming forward with alternative proposals, and the Victorian one’s a great case in point. We’re working really constructively with them. KG: So does the PM say at the election campaign to people if there’s a massive outbreak, look, it was the states’ fault? Is that where we get to? SR: Well, national cabinet was all about being in this together and doing this together. The decision was made together that states and territories would run quarantine. Now the opposition is saying that it’s not good enough the states and territories are running quarantine. And they’re criticising their state and territory colleagues, which I think is a bit harsh. States and territories are doing their best and they’re having a good crack at this. KG: I think they’re criticising you, to be fair. They’re criticising your government. SR Well, they’re saying we should take it over because they’re saying the states are failing. And I don’t think the states are failing. I think our relationship with the states on this is actually going quite well, and we’ll continue to work … WA has also called a Covid presser – 9.15am WA time, which is 11.15am eastern time – so it looks as though that state will also be banning Melbourne residents. Things got slightly heated over in the legal and constitutional affairs estimates a bit earlier, where Labor senator Kim Carr has been questioning officials from the administrative appeals tribunal about the appointment of former Liberal members. Liberal senator David Van asked the AAT to calculate how much time and expense has been incurred answering Carr’s questions, prompting senator Rex Patrick to accuse him and the Morrison government of being “allergic to oversight”. Van asked Patrick to “step outside” and say the same thing, prompting Patrick to invite Van to look at his tweets, which frequently express similar criticisms. A shouting match ensued. The hearing earlier revealed that Jane Prentice, a former Liberal minister, was appointed in February to the AAT, a body that reviews government decisions, while still working for Counsel House, a lobbying firm. Full-time AAT members must seek approval from the president before taking on other paid work. Carr asked if that approval had been sought and obtained. The AAT officials couldn’t answer the question and took it on notice. Attorney general Michaelia Cash was asked when she first became aware of the matter. She replied: I am aware of it now, Senator Carr, because you’ve just raised it, and it has been taken on notice by the registrar to provide you with more information. Carr also questioned the AAT members about the number of part-time members who either have not finished a case or not worked a single day since being appointed. There were 29 members who had not finalised a case in 2018-19, 18 members in 2019-20, and 18 members in 2019-20. Nine members had not performed a single hour of work in 2018-19 and 2019-20, and 13 in 2020-21. AAT registrar Sian Leathem said that may be explained by resignations, members being appointed late in the financial year or other commitments: There is also the case that we have a number of very specialised members that we only use when there is an operational need to allocate work to them and that would mean they were not allocated any work during the time period. We will get the major update in about 20 minutes. We should be able to bring all those answers you want then. The AFL may also have to prepare for delays: The Senate is holding an inquiry into the commonwealth’s new powers to declare a national emergency, which the prime minister can do unilaterally (without state and territory agreement) in certain circumstances. The National Emergency Declaration Act was passed in December 2020 after the bushfire royal commission, and before what legislators feared could be another horror fire season. Although it is already law, it is interesting that there is quite a lot of dissent from the states – including from Coalition governments in Tasmania and New South Wales. The Tasmanian government submitted to the Senate standing committee on legal and constitutional affairs that it “does not support the commonwealth having power to declare a national emergency without the agreement of, or consultation with, states and territories”. It said: Noting that the circumstances that would trigger a national emergency declaration would be exceptional, the Tasmanian government opposes any unilateral decision, declaration or action that affects Tasmania, or its interests, without prior consultation. NSW argued that the condition of “nationally significant harm” could be open to broad interpretation: Any Commonwealth efforts should be targeted at supporting States and Territories’ lead role in emergency response and recovery operations … [The Act should] be aimed solely at improving Commonwealth arrangements for the provision of expedited assistance to the States, and not operate so as to disrupt or interfere with these arrangements. NSW proposed consideration of “multi-agency national-level exercises” to test how the act could work. The Australian Capital Territory called for a new requirement to inform the governments of all affected states and territories when a national emergency declaration is made, regardless of whether consultation has occurred. The Queensland government said it shares the concerns expressed by other states and territories that the act goes beyond the scope of what was recommended by the bushfire royal commission, in not limiting the powers to natural disasters and not defining an emergency. The other big international news today has been Dominic Cummings, the former chief adviser to Boris Johnson, giving evidence about the UK’s Covid policy: The government has no major campaign in place to combat vaccine hesitancy. The messages from the health minister down, when it comes to AstraZeneca, have been confused – ie, please go out and get AstraZeneca, but we will have more Pfizer and Moderna at the end of the year. Now Richard Colbeck, the aged care minister, while explaining why we still haven’t vaccinated all aged care residents – including 29 centres in Melbourne which are yet to receive a single dose – says “people have made their choice” over whether they want the vaccine or not. We are still waiting to learn when the Victorian press conference will be held. Past experience says that the later it is, the more they have to say – there are a lot of details that need to be covered before announcing changes to health policy. We’ll bring you the updates as soon as we have them. We hope everyone is OK – The public hearing scheduled for today by the select committee on mental health and suicide prevention has been cancelled due to illness. The hearing will be rescheduled and the revised public hearing program will be available on the committee website. The House of Representatives has begun with a Labor thrust at Liberal MP Andrew Laming, as MP Julie Collins moved to suspend standing orders for a motion accusing him of reneging on a commitment to resign his parliamentary roles. At the height of the controversy about his treatment of constituents, Laming said he would “step down from all parliamentary roles effective immediately”. But since returning to parliament from health leave, Laming has refused to give up his position as the chair of a parliamentary committee on employment, education and training. The position adds $23,000 to his annual salary. Laming now points to a 28 March statement in which he announced he had taken “health leave from all parliamentary, electorate and committee work”, claiming he never committed to permanently give up the chair’s role. Education minister Alan Tudge moved that Collins no longer be heard. The government won that vote. Laming then gave a personal explanation, saying he had “never resigned” and “never reneged” from a commitment to resign. He attempted to table a “health statement” about his period of leave but Anthony Albanese objected and it appears leave wasn’t granted. The House has now moved on to other business. For those scratching their heads about what all this achieved – Labor has tried this move every morning this week and now has lots of footage of (male) Coalition ministers moving that female Labor members no longer be heard. This follows on from South Australia yesterday – but the NT is now declaring two areas in Victoria hotspot regions – meaning mandatory quarantine if you arrive in the NT and have been in those areas. Here is the declaration: My directions issued at 5:53pm on 25 May 2021 are revoked and replaced with the following: These directions apply to any person who has arrived or who will arrive in the Northern Territory before 00:01 on 27 May 2021 who has been to any of the locations listed as ‘public exposure sites’ by the Victorian Department of Health on or about the relevant times and dates specified at the following link as updated by the Victorian Department of Health from time to time: https://www.coronavirus.vic.gov.au/exposure-sites 3 Any person who has arrived or who will arrive in the Northern Territory before 00:01 on 27 May 2021 who has been in Victoria since 12 May 2021 must check the above website at least once per day and comply with these directions if a place they have been to becomes a public exposure site. Any person to whom these directions apply who has arrived in the Northern Territory or who will arrive in the Northern Territory before 00:01 on 27 May 2021 who has been to a ‘Tier 1’ site, must travel directly to a suitable place of quarantine and remain in that place, except to submit to testing for COVID-19 (or in an emergency). Once tested, the person must remain in the suitable place of quarantine until noon on the 14th day after the last day the person was in the ‘Tier 1’ site, regardless of whether the result of the test is negative. Note: A person who has already had a test may be required to have further tests, at the direction of an authorised officer. If a public exposure site that was a ‘Tier 1 site’ ceases to be a ‘Tier 1’ site, a person who is in quarantine by reason only of that area formerly being a ‘Tier 1 site’ is not required to remain in quarantine, provided they have been tested for COVID-19 and received a negative result. If a public exposure site that was a ‘Tier 2 site’ or a ‘Tier 3 site’ becomes a ‘Tier 1 site’, a person who has been to the site must travel directly to a suitable place of quarantine and remain in that place, except to submit to testing for COVID-19 (or in an emergency). Once tested, the person must remain in the suitable place of quarantine until noon on the 14th day after the last day the person was in the ‘Tier 1’ site, regardless of whether the result of the test is negative. To avoid doubt, a person to whom these directions apply is considered a person who is required to quarantine under my Directions for Territory Border Restrictions (No.49), and all quarantine requirements under my Directions for Territory Border Restrictions apply. If a place of quarantine is deemed not to be suitable, the CHO will direct quarantine to be undertaken at the Howard Springs or Alice Springs quarantine facilities. People have been preparing for the last few days for a potential lockdown: This is not yet confirmed – we will most likely hear from the acting premier around 10.30 or so now, but it looks very likely: I mean, 18 months on, I think we are very past this conversation. Keep an eye on the exposure list sites here. The Victorian police commissioner has not confirmed the lockdown but says police have been preparing for the possibility: Where are Scott Morrison and Greg Hunt getting the “hotel quarantine has been 99.99% effective” stat from? Mark Butler took a guess while a guest on Steve Price’s livestreamed radio show this morning: I think what they’re doing, and I don’t really know, but I think what they’re doing is they’re just simply using the number of people who’ve gone through hotel quarantine. So that’s quite a lot of people coming home from overseas, and then dividing that by the number of leaks. The problem though is it ignores the fact that every single leak is a massive disaster. The whole city of Melbourne is in huge disruption. I see speculation about the possibility of a lockdown being announced this morning. I don’t know whether that is right but I know that would be enormously distressing. I’m not from Melbourne but my Dad lives in Melbourne. I’ve got other relatives and very close friends there. I know how triggering that would be for a city that was locked down for 111 days last year. To know that 40% of aged care facilities in Melbourne have not been fully vaccinated and I think, scandalously, 29 have not received even a single dose when they were promised all across the country to be vaccinated fully by Easter. Given what we know happened last year, I think must be very distressing for everyone. For those trying to work out the number of Covid cases linked to this latest outbreak in Victoria, it’s at 26. One of the 12 cases was mentioned by James Merlino at yesterday’s press conference. So that makes 11 new cases (the ones we didn’t know about) but 12 in total. Day four of estimates is getting under way – a little bit later in the day we will hear from officials within the finance department who deal with Parliament House staffing issues, so we’ll bring you updates from that. The latest Victoria Health numbers are out: Richard Colbeck was pressed on the 29 Victorian aged care homes who were yet to receive any vaccines (aged care is a federal responsibility) outside the Nine studios: I’m very comfortable with the rollout of the vaccination across the – across the country. About 85% of residents across Australia have taken up the vaccine. And it’s been a significant logistical effort. There’s some providers who have put back their vaccine dates so that the residents can get flu vaccinations. We have worked with the providers to schedule them over the last 12 or 13 weeks to get the vaccines. Here is a rundown of the various reports of a lockdown flagged for Victoria. No detail has been given about whether the lockdown will affect the whole state or just greater Melbourne. The Age reports: “A source close to the government, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the confidential decision, said cabinet was set to confirm final details of the lockdown on Thursday morning before announcing the public health measures.” According to the Age, this lockdown will last at least three days, with the finer details being discussed this morning. The ABC is reporting that the cluster has grown overnight to 25 cases, with reporter Richard Willingham saying the lockdown will last at least five days. This is the problem with government leaks before the official announcement – there is confusion about how long the lockdown will last, and which areas it will affect, creating extra anxiety. There has been no announcement of a press conference yet, we’ll keep you posted when we know the details. We can expect the Victorian state government to continue to push for purpose-built quarantine facilities, given the situation that’s unfolding. Yesterday the deputy premier, James Merlino, urged that more secure quarantine facilities be designed and built, with the outbreak in Victoria originating from a hotel quarantine breach in South Australia: There is a sense of urgency about this. The best time to have had an alternative quarantine facility is 12 months ago and the next best time is now, so we are very keen to finalise those discussions with the commonwealth. There are 29 aged care facilities in Victoria which are yet to receive a single dose of vaccine from the federal government. Aged care minister Richard Colbeck was on the Nine Network this morning explaining why, as Melbourne looks about to enter another lockdown because of a Covid outbreak, sparked from a breach in Adelaide hotel quarantine: They should be done in the next few days. We’ve prioritised those. We’ve been working our way obviously across the country. There’s about 600 facilities that the commonwealth has responsibility for in Victoria. As you said, 29 of those left to be done. They were programmed to be done. They were programmed to be done this week or next week, so we’ll get those finalised as quickly as we can. We’re actually going back over other facilities, particularly in those areas of Melbourne where there has been an outbreak. The average vaccination rate across aged care in Australia is about 85%. There’s some that are lower than that so we’re going back and offering people a second chance to take up a vaccine if that’s what they’d like, given the current circumstances. Scott Morrison has also taken to reminding people how bad Covid could have been in Australia if it weren’t for the measures put in place (largely pushed by the states). Yesterday he accused the opposition of “whinging” about the vaccine rollout and said people stopped him on the street to say how happy they were: I know that Australians – because they approach me every time when I go out into regional Australia or the suburbs and cities of this country – they know here, in this country, they’re living a life during Covid like few are anywhere else in the world. This country has enjoyed safety from this pandemic and an economic recovery like few, if any, other countries in the world. Those opposite, Mr Speaker, may want to retreat into whinging and complaining and undermining the government, as we fight the virus and they focus on the politics. (Nice order of importance there too, in terms of the geographical indicators he used in that sentence.) Kristina Keneally spoke to ABC News Breakfast about that attitude this morning: Well, if we take that argument from the prime minister at face value – well, 17 outbreaks in six months – “You’ve never had it so good, what are you complaining about?” Let me tell you, the people of Melbourne today who are facing the prospect of another extended lockdown, they would disagree with the prime minister. They would say, “You got a report, prime minister, some nine months ago from Jane Halton, your handpicked expert, who told you hotel quarantine is not fit-for-purpose.” Hotels are for tourists, not for quarantine and medical purposes. We rolled it out at the beginning of the pandemic because we needed something quickly. But we now know so much more about this virus, we know it is airborne, we know hotels are not fit-for-purpose for quarantine. Jane Halton gave the prime minister multiple recommendations and he has failed to act on a single one of them. He could be, for example, taking up Victoria’s offer of the Mickleham facility and expanding that. He could be working with Queensland, with their offer to expand and work with him on a national quarantine system in that state. He could be looking at Bladin Point in the Northern Territory. Yet this is a prime minister who thinks that this is not his problem. He wants to shove everything onto the states – everything is someone else’s responsibility, and nothing is his fault. In a national pandemic, and an international pandemic, that is simply not good enough from our prime minister. Looking to some other news at the moment, a significant judgment has just come out of The Hague: A court in The Hague has ordered Royal Dutch Shell to cut its global carbon emissions by 45% by the end of 2030 compared with 2019 levels, in a landmark case brought by Friends of the Earth and over 17,000 co-plaintiffs. The oil giant’s sustainability policy was found to be insufficiently “concrete” by the Dutch court in an unprecedented ruling that will have wide implications for the energy industry and other polluting multinationals. The Anglo-Dutch company was told it had a duty of care and that the level of emission reductions of Shell and its suppliers and buyers should be brought into line with the Paris climate agreement. More than a year on from the start of the pandemic, after hotel quarantine breaches in all states and with no end in sight, you have to wonder why more people aren’t screaming for purpose-built quarantine facilities. Scott Morrison has taken to saying that hotel quarantine is 99.9% effective. But, as we are seeing from one of those 0.01% of failures, which is happening to Melbourne after a breach in an Adelaide quarantine hotel, the cost on communities is very, very high. Hotel quarantine was set up in a couple of weeks in an answer to new problems. Hotels are not set up as quarantine spaces. They have shared ventilation, for starters. We have learnt more about the virus and more about the impact of airborne particles. This is not something the federal government can continue to shrug off. Meanwhile, back in 1950, John “lots of numbers” Troll has something to say about parents in the workplace: We are expecting the Victorian press conference to be held about 9.30am or so. I’m so sorry, Melbourne. We will hopefully be hearing from Victorian authorities soon. The Herald Sun has reported the possibility of a five-day lockdown is on the cards, given the number of exposure sites. That also includes Marvel Stadium – anyone sitting on level one, between rows five and 28 and level three between aisles six and 29 is considered a tier 2 contact – and must get a Covid test and isolate until results come in. (That was Sunday’s Essendon v North Melbourne game.) You may have heard a lot from Peter Dutton lately about defence spending. Daniel Hurst has taken a look at a small slither of that spend: Australia’s defence department has revealed it is spending $37m to hire private helicopters as it grapples with low availability of the trouble-plagued Taipan choppers. The move comes as defence officials concede a fault found in one of the helicopters in 2019 – when it was on its way to pick up the Australian defence force chief, Angus Campbell – could have led to “catastrophic consequences” if left unfixed. It has prompted the opposition to blast the Howard government-era acquisition of the Multi-Role Helicopters (MRH90), also known as Taipans, as “a farce from go to whoa”. Australia needs to avoid adding to a global “race to the bottom” over military ambitions in space, amid concerns that the major powers are seeking to dominate space, according to a new report. The Australian defence force is setting up a space division at the Royal Australian Air Force headquarters in Canberra early next year, with the government planning to spend $7bn on space capabilities over the next decade. The government has also launched an Australian Space Agency. Dr Cassandra Steer, a senior lecturer at the Australian National University’s college of law who specialises in space law, said space was “a critical strategic domain for Australia’s civilian and military interests” but was “increasingly congested, contested and competitive”. She said major powers were engaged in “a destabilising space arms race”, with China, Russia and the US rejecting the strategic restraint that had kept space a stable political and military domain. In a policy options paper published by the ANU’s national security college today, Steer said Australia could act as a “middle space power” and encourage responsible behaviour in space. She argued Australian leaders should “avoid inadvertently contributing to escalatory rhetoric”. That meant avoiding descriptions of space as a “warfighting domain” or a “battlespace”: Australia needs to be careful that, as it develops sovereign space capabilities, it does not accelerate a global strategic race to the bottom. Rather, Australia should focus on its ability to become an effective diplomatic space power – building on our history as a strong contributor to space technologies and arms control norms. The paper calls on the government to invest in space literacy training across the Australian public service and for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to appoint a “space ambassador” with a dedicated team to influence the space agenda internationally. While you were sleeping, US president Joe Biden ordered an intelligence investigation into the origins of the coronavirus. You can read the Guardian’s full story here: We start this morning with the news that the list of exposure sites in Victoria has grown to 70. I think we can expect further social distancing measures to be announced today in response to that – it’s a huge list. It includes a NSW western Riverina sporting club in Tooleybuc, which is near the Victorian border. A positive case attended a football match at Cohuna which the Tooleybuc club was at. Anyone who was at the Cohuna recreation reserve on Saturday 22 May between 12pm and 5pm must get a Covid test and isolate until they receive their results. NSW has already officially asked all residents to rethink any non-urgent travel to greater Melbourne or Bendigo. South Australia has gone further and shut its borders to Melbourne residents as of 6pm last night. We’ll keep across everything that happens as it does, as well as parliament and estimates.

Des providers get their remaining 40% of revenue from service fees for coaching jobseekers, matching them with jobs, connecting with employers, and administrative tasks such as overseeing job search requirements, known as mutual obligations. Internal documents reveal the Boston Consulting Report was triggered in part due to departmental fears of “emerging trend where participants assigned to a higher funding level are being channelled into education activities as opposed to employment”. This prompted a department crackdown which included “locking down IT systems to ensure providers cannot influence participant eligibility for education outcomes”. It’s understood the department took action to stop providers lowering a person’s education qualifications in the system, which had allowed job agencies to claim a higher bonus fee from the government. Boston Consulting Group then warned there was “limited evidence” the increase in education fees claimed meant jobseekers were graduating their courses, or that they were being “enrolled in courses which relate to their employment prospects”. Jobseekers were pleased they could choose their provider, the report said, but they were still concerned providers’ “support was not individualised” and jobs offered were often unsuitable. One jobseeker told the review, “We are just money to them. It’s a pay packet, they don’t listen.” Employers told the review they dealt with “poorly skilled staff who lack an understanding of the corporate environment” and were “flooded with inappropriate applications”. The review also found providers’ efforts to offer a quality service were hampered by “compliance and administrative burdens”, such as administering mutual obligations, which might be better handled by Centrelink. The review’s recommendations included tightening bonuses paid to providers for education outcomes, considering whether to combine jobactive and Des into a single program, and reassessing the funding the government provides for “effective program oversight”. Kristin O’Connell, an Australian Unemployed Workers’ Union spokesperson, said the report was “damning evidence about the failures of privatised employment services”. She said some of the money would be better spent lifting payments for welfare recipients. The Greens senator Rachel Siewert said that while she supported increased spending on employment services, extra money that went to providers should lead to better outcomes for jobseekers. The report showed this was not the case. Anne Ruston, the social services minister, said the government’s 2018 reforms were aimed at giving jobseekers more options and improving competition between providers. While she said there had been position progress, “further refinement” was needed to make the program more efficient. Ruston said “upskilling and retraining can be important”, but added: “Clearly, we have a situation where some providers have an overemphasis on education outcomes that are not leading to jobs and this needs to be addressed.” She said the government had tightened provider payments for education course referrals in the May budget and would also allow jobseekers to request to join the new digital employment service. It is also working on an updated provider star rating system, which was also criticised in the report. The National Employment Services Association was approached for comment.","charCount":"5941","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/luke-henriques-gomes\">Luke Henriques-Gomes</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2021/may/27/australian-court-finds-government-has-duty-to-protect-young-people-from-climate-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-27T01:50:32Z","webTitle":"Australian court finds government has duty to protect young people from climate crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/may/27/australian-court-finds-government-has-duty-to-protect-young-people-from-climate-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2021/may/27/australian-court-finds-government-has-duty-to-protect-young-people-from-climate-crisis","fields":{"headline":"Australian court finds government has duty to protect young people from climate crisis","standfirst":"<p>Eight teenagers, along with 86-year-old nun, launched case to prevent the approval of a massive coalmine</p>","trailText":"Eight teenagers, along with 86-year-old nun, launched case to prevent the approval of a massive coalmine","byline":"Adam Morton Environment editor","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2ce9b56d7160e32136537f15f70abaad0b1928e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ce9b56d7160e32136537f15f70abaad0b1928e4/0_55_1362_817/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sister Brigid Arthur, 86, and Anj Sharma, 16, are among a group who secured a judgment from the Australian federal court that found the government has a duty to protect young people from climate change. \" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sister Brigid Arthur, 86, and Anj Sharma, 16, are among a group who secured a judgment from the Australian federal court that found the government has a duty to protect young people from climate change. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>The federal court of Australia has found the environment minister, Sussan Ley, has a duty of care to protect young people from the climate crisis in a judgment hailed by lawyers and teenagers who brought the case as a world first.</p> <p>Eight teenagers and an octogenarian nun <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/mar/02/a-duty-of-care-australian-teenagers-take-their-climate-crisis-plea-to-court\">had sought an injunction</a> to prevent Ley approving a proposal by Whitehaven Coal to expand the Vickery coalmine in northern New South Wales, arguing the minister had a common law duty of care to protect younger people against future harm from climate change.</p> <p>Justice Mordecai Bromberg found the minister had a duty of care to not act in a way that would cause future harm to younger people.

Eight teenagers and an octogenarian nun had sought an injunction to prevent Ley approving a proposal by Whitehaven Coal to expand the Vickery coalmine in northern New South Wales, arguing the minister had a common law duty of care to protect younger people against future harm from climate change. Justice Mordecai Bromberg found the minister had a duty of care to not act in a way that would cause future harm to younger people. But he did not grant the injunction as he was not satisfied the minister would breach her duty of care. David Barnden, a lawyer representing the children, said it was a historic and “amazing decision” with potentially significant consequences. “The court has found that the minister owes a duty of care to younger children, to vulnerable people, and that duty says that the minister must not act in a way that causes harm - future harm - from climate change to younger people,” he said outside court. “It is the first time in the world that such a duty of care has been recognised, especially in a common law country.” He said Bromberg had indicated he would now take submissions before making further declarations about what the minister’s duty of care may mean for whether the mine extension could go ahead. Whitehaven Coal had a different interpretation of the judgment. In a statement to the stock exchange, it did not mention the duty of care finding, and said it welcomed the court dismissing the teenagers’ attempt to block Ley from approving the mine extension. “Our consistent position has been that this legal claim was without merit,” it said. “Whitehaven looks forward to receiving the…approval for the Vickery extension project and will keep the market updated as appropriate.” Speaking for the children, 17-year-old Ava Princi said it was “thrilling and deeply relieving” that the justice had recognised the minister had a duty of care. “I am thrilled because this is a landmark decision,” she said. “My future and the future of all young people depends on Australia stepping away from fossil fuel projects and joining the world in taking decisive climate action.” She said though an injunction was not granted the case was “not over yet”. “There will be further submissions on what the duty of care means for the minister’s decision and the mine,” she said The teenagers, led by the 16-year-old Melbourne student Anj Sharma and supported by Sister Brigid Arthur, an 86-year-old nun and former teacher who volunteered to be their litigation guardian, argued Ley would be breaching a common law duty of care if she used her powers under national environment laws to allow Whitehaven Coal to extend the Vickery mine. The court heard the expansion of the mine could lead to an extra 100m tonnes of CO2 – about 20% of Australia’s annual climate footprint – being released into the atmosphere as the extracted coal is shipped overseas and burned to make steel and generate electricity. In his judgment, Bromberg said the evidence presented to the court showed the potential harm the children could face due to global heating “may fairly be described as catastrophic, particularly should global average surface temperatures rise to and exceed 3°C beyond the pre-industrial level”. “Perhaps the most startling of the potential harms demonstrated by the evidence before the court, is that one million of today’s Australian children are expected to suffer at least one heat-stress episode serious enough to require acute care in a hospital,” he said. “Many thousands will suffer premature death from heat-stress or bushfire smoke. Substantial economic loss and property damage will be experienced. The Great Barrier Reef and most of Australia’s eastern eucalypt forests will no longer exist due to repeated, severe bushfires.” Bromberg found that the minister had a common law duty to take reasonable care not to cause the children personal injury when using her powers under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act. He did not grant an injunction to prevent the mine extension because he had “not been satisfied that a reasonable apprehension of breach of the duty of care by the minister has been established”. Ley’s office was asked for its response to the judgment.","charCount":"4463","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/adam-morton\">Adam Morton</a> Environment editor"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2021/may/27/covid-restrictions-victoria-new-greater-melbourne-and-vic-coronavirus-rules-explained","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-27T01:48:05Z","webTitle":"Covid Victoria lockdown restrictions: new Melbourne and Vic coronavirus rules explained","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/may/27/covid-restrictions-victoria-new-greater-melbourne-and-vic-coronavirus-rules-explained","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2021/may/27/covid-restrictions-victoria-new-greater-melbourne-and-vic-coronavirus-rules-explained","fields":{"headline":"Covid Victoria lockdown restrictions: new Melbourne and Vic coronavirus rules explained","standfirst":"<p>New Victorian Covid-19 restrictions have been announced in response to a growing number of cases in a Melbourne suburbs coronavirus outbreak.

The state also said a Dayton-area teen is the first winner of the program’s full-ride college scholarship. The names were announced Wednesday night at the end of the Ohio Lottery’s Cash Explosion TV show. Four more winners of the $1m prize and four college scholarship winners will be announced each Wednesday for the next four weeks. The state’s Republican governor, Mike DeWine, announced the program 12 May to boost lagging vaccination rates. More than 2.7 million adults registered for the money prize and more than 100,000 children ages 12 to 17 entered for the scholarship, which includes tuition, room and board, and books. The Ohio Lottery conducted the first drawing Monday afternoon at its draw studio in Cleveland using a random number generator to pick the winners ahead of time, and then confirmed the eligibility of the ultimate winner. “I know that some may say, ‘DeWine, you’re crazy! This million-dollar drawing idea of yours is a waste of money,’” the governor said when he announced the incentive. But with the vaccine now readily available, the real waste, “is a life lost to Covid-19”, the governor said. The concept seemed to work, at least initially. The number of people in Ohio age 16 and older who received their initial Covid-19 vaccine jumped 33% in the week after the state announced its million-dollar incentive lottery, according to an Associated Press analysis. But the same review also found that vaccination rates are still well below figures from earlier in April and March. More than 5.2 million people in Ohio had at least started the vaccination process as of Monday, or about 45% of the state. About 4.6 million people are done getting vaccinated, or 39% of the state. Vax-a-Million is open to permanent Ohio residents who have received either the one-dose Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine or their first part of the two-dose Pfizer or Moderna vaccination. DeWine’s proposal inspired similar vaccine-incentive lotteries in Colorado, Maryland, New York state and Oregon. In Colorado, governor Jared Polis says the state will have a weekly lottery for five residents to win $1m Tuesday, and is using federal coronavirus relief funds to do so. Other states are also providing incentives to encourage vaccinations. In New Jersey, residents 21 and older can get a free beer after receiving their first vaccination. Maine residents who get their first shot of the vaccine before the end of May can choose from several outdoor-themed prizes including fishing or hunting licenses or day passes to state parks.","charCount":"2671","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"Guardian staff and agency"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2021/may/27/afl-scrambles-again-as-melbourne-lockdown-causes-chaos-for-sport","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-27T01:26:41Z","webTitle":"AFL scrambles again as Melbourne lockdown causes chaos for sport","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/may/27/afl-scrambles-again-as-melbourne-lockdown-causes-chaos-for-sport","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2021/may/27/afl-scrambles-again-as-melbourne-lockdown-causes-chaos-for-sport","fields":{"headline":"AFL scrambles again as Melbourne lockdown causes chaos for sport","standfirst":"<ul><li>Games in Melbourne to go ahead but without crowds</li><li>Richmond’s match against Adelaide moved to Sydney </li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/may/27/covid-restrictions-victoria-new-greater-melbourne-and-vic-coronavirus-rules-explained\">Victoria’s new Covid lockdown restrictions explained</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/may/27/covid-19-melbourne-exposure-sites-hotspots-list-victoria-metro-regional-vic-coronavirus-cases-outbreak-locations\">Full list of case alerts and public exposure sites in Victoria</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2021/may/27/coronavirus-australia-live-updates-victoria-braces-for-potential-lockdown-to-contain-melbourne-outbreak-covid-cases-restrictions-scott-morrison-brittany-higgins-james-merlino-nsw-border-closure-afl-crowds-exposure-sites-mcg\">Follow LIVE Covid updates on Thursday as Victoria goes into seven-day lockdown</a></li></ul>","trailText":"The AFL is again scrambling to keep its season on track as Victorians prepared to enter a seven-day circuit-breaker lockdown in response to the growing Covid-19 cluster","byline":"Guardian sport","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"933cfdb538e7fbb21c899c983c07cc7f072bfbbe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/933cfdb538e7fbb21c899c983c07cc7f072bfbbe/0_365_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The MCG\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The MCG was due to host two games this weekend.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Cianflone/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>The AFL is again scrambling to keep its season on track as Victorians prepared to enter a seven-day circuit-breaker lockdown in response to the growing Covid-19 cluster.</p> <p>Victorian health officials announced on Thursday 11 new cases, taking the total number in the recent outbreak to 26 and throwing the AFL’s plans into chaos.</p> <p>The state’s acting premier James Merlino confirmed approved sporting events would go ahead this week, but without crowds.</p> <p>But Richmond’s match against Adelaide – originally scheduled to be played at the MCG on Sunday – has been moved to Sydney following the closure of South Australia’s border with Victoria, while the Gold Coast’s game with Hawthorn in Darwin on Saturday has been postponed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/may/26/afl-confirms-crowds-at-melbourne-games-despite-covid-outbreak-and-mcg-virus-alert\">Victoria AFL clubs in lockdown as second fan at weekend match tests positive for Covid</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Hawks were one of three Melbourne teams with interstate matches this week who made plans to leave the city earlier than scheduled to avoid getting trapped by a lockdown.

Victorian health officials announced on Thursday 11 new cases, taking the total number in the recent outbreak to 26 and throwing the AFL’s plans into chaos. The state’s acting premier James Merlino confirmed approved sporting events would go ahead this week, but without crowds. But Richmond’s match against Adelaide – originally scheduled to be played at the MCG on Sunday – has been moved to Sydney following the closure of South Australia’s border with Victoria, while the Gold Coast’s game with Hawthorn in Darwin on Saturday has been postponed. The Hawks were one of three Melbourne teams with interstate matches this week who made plans to leave the city earlier than scheduled to avoid getting trapped by a lockdown. Essendon and Carlton managed to escape on Wednesday, but Hawthorn were unable to fly to the Northern Territory on Thursday. More fixture changes are likely, with the Demons’ top-of-the-table clash with the Western Bulldogs on Friday night in jeopardy after reports that a player attended a Covid exposure site earlier this week. All 10 Victorian clubs were on Wednesday ordered into an AFL-imposed lockdown and were told they face restrictions for at least the next seven days with players and staff asked to leave only for playing, training and essential other reasons. It comes after two venues – the MCG and Marvel Stadium – were visited on Sunday by people who later tested positive for the coronavirus. Given the volume of clubs based in Melbourne, the AFL is the league most affected by the new measures. The NRL remains relatively unaffected with the Storm already in camp on the Gold Coast and intending to extend their stay in Queensland beyond Thursday night’s game in Brisbane. But the NRL is expected to make a call on the opening State of Origin game, scheduled to take place at the MCG on 9 June. Peter V’landys said the league would consult with biosecurity experts before making a decision, with Canberra, Perth and Adelaide shaping up as alternative venue options. Queensland has also put up its hand to host the opener after state premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said she was in talks with the NRL over a possible switch to either Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane or Queensland Country Bank Stadium in Townsville. Super Netball club Melbourne Vixens also left the state earlier than planned due to the outbreak, bringing forward their departure to Queensland from Friday to Wednesday.","charCount":"2589","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/guardian-sport\">Guardian sport</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2021/may/27/jodi-mckay-leadership-turmoil-threatens-to-throw-nsw-labor-back-to-the-the-bad-old-days","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-27T00:38:36Z","webTitle":"Leadership turmoil threatens to throw NSW Labor back to the bad old days | Anne Davies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/may/27/jodi-mckay-leadership-turmoil-threatens-to-throw-nsw-labor-back-to-the-the-bad-old-days","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2021/may/27/jodi-mckay-leadership-turmoil-threatens-to-throw-nsw-labor-back-to-the-the-bad-old-days","fields":{"headline":"Leadership turmoil threatens to throw NSW Labor back to the bad old days","standfirst":"<p>Warring tribes and a thin pool of talent are among the obstacles facing the party as Jodi McKay scrambles to rebuilt a tarnished brand<br></p>","trailText":"Warring tribes and a thin pool of talent are among the obstacles facing the party as Jodi McKay scrambles to rebuilt a tarnished brand<br>","byline":"Anne Davies","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"36e7e9adb94d5bf279272ec382ddc8db844fccc2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/36e7e9adb94d5bf279272ec382ddc8db844fccc2/0_0_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jodi McKay’s lead rival for the NSW Labor leadership, Chris Minns (right), resigned from shadow cabinet on Wednesday, signalling he is exploring a possible leadership challenge.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">NSW Labor leader Jodi McKay’s chief rival for the top job, Chris Minns (right), resigned from shadow cabinet on Wednesday.

But Labor is now dealing with the secondary consequences of those years. After tarnishing the brand so badly and spending a decade in opposition, the pool of talent on Labor’s frontbench has become decidedly thin, and few have experience of government. Jodi McKay was chosen to lead Labor following the 2019 election when Michael Daley, MP for Maroubra and one of the few with experience in the Carr ministry, stood down after losing. In the last two weeks of the 2019 campaign, a tape emerged of Daley giving a speech in a pub, in which he had reflected that people from “Asia with PhDs” were taking Australian jobs. What role the comments played in the defeat is unclear. Daley denied they were racist but stepped down after narrowly losing to premier Gladys Berejiklian. Daley had only been in the job for four months, after the resignation of Luke Foley as leader. Daley appeared to run a competent campaign, but the election stumble was too raw and recent to be easily brushed aside. Labor then opted for a woman and someone unequivocally seen as not part of the old party. McKay, a former newsreader, gave evidence at the independent commission against corruption against former Labor colleagues in 2014 and has subsequently traded on her cleanskin image. This is why accusations of a “dirt dossier” being deployed against McKay’s main leadership rival Chris Minns this week could be so damaging. McKay denied any knowledge of it, and said a staff member in her deputy leader’s office had been let go. But some of the actual contents of the dossier were hardly revelatory. The dossier contained a summary of public evidence to Icac about Minns. It canvassed matters raised in the Icac investigation known as Operation Aero into Labor’s donations, including $10,000 in donations Minns was forced to return after Icac heard evidence of an elaborate scheme to launder undeclared cash donations. This included $100,000 allegedly given to NSW ALP head office by Chinese businessman Huang Xiangmo in an Aldi shopping bag. Huang has since had his visa cancelled after Asio deemed him a security risk and left Australia. Counsel assisting Icac, Peter Hall, said there was no evidence implicating Minns in the donation-washing scheme and he was not under investigation by Icac. But nonetheless, the issue of Chinese influence remains a serious one for both the state Labor and Liberal parties and for the security agencies. The Icac investigation into NSW Labor and donations is still to report. It is unclear what it will find. Minns can expect much closer scrutiny if he takes the leadership. Another challenge will be a redistribution that will make his seat of Kogarah highly marginal. Meanwhile, Daley is still supporting McKay, and is reportedly returning to the frontbench. He has the experience and is tough on the floor of parliament, but could be seen as representing a return to the past. The other two possible leadership contenders are relatively unknown to the public domain but also represent a generational change. Ryan Park, the MP for Kiera, and Paul Scully from Wollongong, are both seen as rising stars from the Illawarra and well-connected with the blue-collar union movement as a result. Both have shown they are hard workers for their constituents and for the party. But Park is not aligned with either the left or the right, which could prove a handicap. Others say he is too eager to be liked, which could count against him when colleagues weigh the options. The problem now is how Labor moves beyond this crisis. Some want generational change. Most are just heartsick that it has come to this. Under Labor’s new rules, a spill of the leadership can only occur if 60% of the caucus agrees. That then triggers a plebiscite of the rank and file of the party, followed by a vote of caucus. It would take months and cost serious money at a time when the party is gearing up to fight a federal election in the next 12 months. It is understood that Minns does not have the numbers yet to mount a challenge and there are no signs that McKay intends to resign. But there is anger in the ranks over the dossier, which could shift numbers. Minns upped the ante on Wednesday by resigning from the shadow cabinet, as did his supporter Walt Secord. McKay will now respond with a reshuffle, which will be closely analysed by all. It will become a fight for competing narratives: a party in chaos or a party rebuilding. The new rules have changed the dynamic and they offer much greater protection for an incumbent, compared with the old days when a challenge almost inevitably led to a spill. But they cannot preserve political authority, only the position. The Minns camp is hoping that ALP secretary Bob Nanva will intervene, as past secretaries have done, and prevail on McKay to go in the interest of the party. So far he has been silent. Instead, there is likely to be a slow burn of destabilising as the warring tribes attempt to gain momentum or shore up the status quo. Meanwhile, the public will recall the bad old days of Labor.","charCount":"5373","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/anne-davies\">Anne Davies</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2021/may/27/covid-19-melbourne-exposure-sites-hotspots-list-victoria-metro-regional-vic-coronavirus-cases-outbreak-locations","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-27T00:35:36Z","webTitle":"Victoria Covid public exposure sites: full list of Melbourne venues and Vic coronavirus hotspots and case location alerts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/may/27/covid-19-melbourne-exposure-sites-hotspots-list-victoria-metro-regional-vic-coronavirus-cases-outbreak-locations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2021/may/27/covid-19-melbourne-exposure-sites-hotspots-list-victoria-metro-regional-vic-coronavirus-cases-outbreak-locations","fields":{"headline":"Victoria Covid public exposure sites: full list of Melbourne venues and Vic coronavirus hotspots and case location alerts","standfirst":"<p>Here are the current coronavirus hotspots and Covid-19 exposure sites in Victoria and Melbourne, and what to do if you’ve visited them</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/may/27/covid-restrictions-victoria-new-greater-melbourne-and-vic-coronavirus-rules-explained\">Victoria’s new Covid lockdown restrictions explained</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2021/may/27/coronavirus-australia-live-updates-victoria-braces-for-potential-lockdown-to-contain-melbourne-outbreak-covid-cases-restrictions-scott-morrison-brittany-higgins-james-merlino-nsw-border-closure-afl-crowds-exposure-sites-mcg\">Follow LIVE Covid updates on Thursday: Victoria goes into seven-day lockdown to contain Melbourne cases</a></li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2018/may/15/the-guardian-app?CMP=cvau_sfl\">Download the free Guardian app</a><br></p></ul>","trailText":"Here are the current coronavirus hotspots and Covid-19 exposure sites in Victoria and Melbourne, and what to do if you’ve visited themVictoria’s Covid restrictions explained","byline":"Guardian staff","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bcd3c4def6dd56c58e9ef11bb7a413312d8bf9c6\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bcd3c4def6dd56c58e9ef11bb7a413312d8bf9c6/0_260_4854_2913/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Check our full list of Covid-19 public exposure sites in Victoria and Melbourne for Covid hotspots and coronavirus case location alerts.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Check our full list of Covid-19 public exposure sites in Victoria and Melbourne for Covid hotspots and coronavirus case location alerts.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Ross/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure>","body":"<p>Authorities have released a list of public exposure sites in Melbourne and Victoria visited by a confirmed case of Covid-19.</p> \n<p>Here are the current coronavirus hotspots and Covid exposure sites, and what to do if you’ve visited them</p> \n<h2><strong>List of public exposure sites in Victoria</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom element--showcase\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2021/01/nsw-covid-hotspots/table4\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>More detailed information is available at the <a href=\"https://www.dhhs.vic.gov.au/case-locations-and-outbreaks#case-alerts--public-exposure-sites\">Department of Health and Human Services website</a>.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><em>Due to the unprecedented and ongoing nature of the coronavirus outbreak, this article is being regularly updated to ensure that it reflects the current situation at the date of publication.

It was a relatively quiet day, with the news of a mass shooting in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/26/san-jose-shooting-police-gunman-railyard\">San Jose that left eight people and the gunman dead</a> prompting renewed mourning, but no political shifts. </p> <p>Here’s an updated summary of today’s key events: </p> <ul> <li><strong>Joe Biden has asked the intelligence community to “redouble” its efforts to study the origins of coronavirus. </strong>The president is requesting a follow-up report on the issue within 90 days. The request comes days after the Wall Street Journal broke the news of a previously undisclosed US intelligence report about three Wuhan researchers being hospitalized with coronavirus-like symptoms in November 2019. The report intensified speculation that the virus started spreading as a result of a laboratory accident.</li> <li><strong>A shooting at a railyard in San Jose, California, left eight people dead, </strong>in addition to the shooter, who was identified as an employee of the Valley Transportation Authority. Biden has been briefed on the shooting, and the vice-president, <strong>Kamala Harris, </strong>described it as “absolutely tragic”.<br></li> <li>The <strong>justice department released a strategy for combatting homicide and violence</strong><strong>, </strong><strong>pledging to support community prevention and intervention programs</strong>, focus law enforcement action narrowly on the people and locations driving current violence, and measure the success of US attorneys’ efforts not on the raw number of people arrested or incarcerated for committing violent crimes, but on whether violence actually goes up or down. </li> <li><strong>US diplomats sent a letter to the state department complaining that those with “Havana syndrome” are being denied proper care, </strong>according to NBC News. The diplomats are calling for the <strong>Biden administration </strong>to take the condition more seriously, NBC reported.</li> <li> A new survey found that <strong>a majority of Asian Americans feel unsafe in public at least some of the time because of their race. </strong><br></li> <li>Michigan election official <strong>Jocelyn Benson</strong>, a Democrat,<strong> </strong>warned that <strong>election-focused conspiracy theories and disinformation are likely to intensify in 2022 and 2024, a trend that threatens to undermine the legitimacy of US democracy. </strong></li> <li><strong>Senate Republicans will soon propose a counteroffer in the ongoing negotiations over an infrastructure package. </strong>The Republican negotiators are expected to propose spending $1tn on an infrastructure bill, which is still far less than the $1.7tn that Biden called for last week, when he issued his own counteroffer.</li> <li><strong>Karine Jean-Pierre made history as the first openly gay person and the second Black woman to ever hold a White House briefing. </strong>The principal deputy White House press secretary held her first formal briefing with reporters this afternoon.</li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-05-27T00:13:06.846Z\">at 1.13am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-60aedacc8f088d8c3178a415\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-05-26T23:38:38.074Z\">12.38am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Ohio announces first winners of vaccine incentive lottery </strong></p> <p>Ohio has announced the first winners of the state’s Vax-a-Million incentive prizes, which include $1m for those 18 and older and a full-ride college scholarship for teens, as the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/or-state-wire-ohio-coronavirus-pandemic-coronavirus-vaccine-health-4c7a3728b79700faea66a6d5b57966fe\">Associated Press reported earlier</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JoshCroup/status/1397698706531663880\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Congratulations to Ohio&#39;s first Vax-a-Million winner, Abbigail Bugenske of Silverton! <br><br>Joseph Costello of Englewood is the first college scholarship winner! <a href=\"https://t.co/Ri6jrZkFi6\">pic.twitter.com/Ri6jrZkFi6</a></p>&mdash; Josh Croup 13abc (@JoshCroup) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JoshCroup/status/1397698706531663880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 26, 2021</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The state’s Republican governor, Mike DeWine, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/ohio-coronavirus-lottery-prize-7058159d2c71eabd19b541194a1e2d95\">announced the program 12 May</a> to boost lagging vaccination rates.

It was a relatively quiet day, with the news of a mass shooting in San Jose that left eight people and the gunman dead prompting renewed mourning, but no political shifts. Here’s an updated summary of today’s key events: Joe Biden has asked the intelligence community to “redouble” its efforts to study the origins of coronavirus. The president is requesting a follow-up report on the issue within 90 days. The request comes days after the Wall Street Journal broke the news of a previously undisclosed US intelligence report about three Wuhan researchers being hospitalized with coronavirus-like symptoms in November 2019. The report intensified speculation that the virus started spreading as a result of a laboratory accident. A shooting at a railyard in San Jose, California, left eight people dead, in addition to the shooter, who was identified as an employee of the Valley Transportation Authority. Biden has been briefed on the shooting, and the vice-president, Kamala Harris, described it as “absolutely tragic”. The justice department released a strategy for combatting homicide and violence, pledging to support community prevention and intervention programs, focus law enforcement action narrowly on the people and locations driving current violence, and measure the success of US attorneys’ efforts not on the raw number of people arrested or incarcerated for committing violent crimes, but on whether violence actually goes up or down. US diplomats sent a letter to the state department complaining that those with “Havana syndrome” are being denied proper care, according to NBC News. The diplomats are calling for the Biden administration to take the condition more seriously, NBC reported. A new survey found that a majority of Asian Americans feel unsafe in public at least some of the time because of their race. Michigan election official Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, warned that election-focused conspiracy theories and disinformation are likely to intensify in 2022 and 2024, a trend that threatens to undermine the legitimacy of US democracy. Senate Republicans will soon propose a counteroffer in the ongoing negotiations over an infrastructure package. The Republican negotiators are expected to propose spending $1tn on an infrastructure bill, which is still far less than the $1.7tn that Biden called for last week, when he issued his own counteroffer. Karine Jean-Pierre made history as the first openly gay person and the second Black woman to ever hold a White House briefing. The principal deputy White House press secretary held her first formal briefing with reporters this afternoon. Ohio announces first winners of vaccine incentive lottery Ohio has announced the first winners of the state’s Vax-a-Million incentive prizes, which include $1m for those 18 and older and a full-ride college scholarship for teens, as the Associated Press reported earlier. The state’s Republican governor, Mike DeWine, announced the program 12 May to boost lagging vaccination rates. More than 2.7 million adults registered for the money prize and more than 100,000 children ages 12 to 17 entered for the scholarship, which includes tuition, room and board, and books, the Associated Press reported. The concept seemed to work, at least initially. The number of people in Ohio age 16 and older who received their initial Covid-19 vaccine jumped 33% in the week after the state announced its million-dollar incentive lottery, according to an Associated Press analysis. But the same review also found that vaccination rates are still well below figures from earlier in April and March. Four more winners of the $1m and a college scholarship will be announced each Wednesday for the next four weeks. Los Angeles Times journalists file lawsuit against Minnesota state patrol A Los Angeles Times reporter and photographer have filed a lawsuit against Minnesota state patrol troopers over injuries they received while covering protests over George Floyd’s murder by police last year, the Minneapolis Star-Tribune reports. One of the journalists, Molly Hennessy-Fiske, tweeted that she is seeking “information and accountability” for the state patrol “attacking us while we were covering protests a year ago.” NYT seeks ‘hard fact’ editor to oversee weddings coverage, fact-check dating claims Most media job postings don’t get much attention. But a new job listing from the Styles section of The New York Times was unusually candid. The paper is seeking a new editor for weddings coverage who is “highly skilled at hard fact editing.” “Listen,” the listing read, “If you think that the D.C. bureau or the politics desk deals with people lying to them or hiding facts, wait till you start asking someone about their dating history.” Some readers who have personally submitted wedding announcements to the Times confirmed that the fact-checking process was unusually intense (though, as others noted, not without slip-ups.) And others noted that the job listing sounded like a pretty good premise for a romantic comedy. Cate Doty, a former New York Times weddings writer, has a just-published new memoir dishing about the inside drama of the Times’ wedding section. Michigan’s Democratic secretary of state, Jocelyn Benson, was on the front lines of the protests and election disinformation fueled by Trump’s “big lie” about election fraud as the battleground state’s chief election official. In a new interview with the Associated Press, Benson warns that the ongoing disputes and conspiracy theories around the 2020 election are only the beginning of what she sees as a sustained attack on American democracy that will culminate in a renewed attack on election legitimacy in 2024. Here’s a key exchange from the full interview: AP: Across the country, we are seeing several GOP-controlled legislatures seeking to exert more control over election officials. How concerned are you that we could end up seeing more of these outside ballot reviews like in Arizona or even takeovers of local election offices? BENSON: I feel very strongly that the battles that we saw around 2020’s election ... was just the beginning of what is clearly turning out to be a multi-year, strategic, nationally coordinated, partisan assault on the vote in our country and on our democracy. And we will see another battle in the 2022 elections around that truth and around the security of the vote, around access to the vote. But it’s also all going to culminate, I believe, in an effort to try again in 2024 what those democracy deniers attempted to do in 2020 but failed. And in 2024, the bad actors, I believe, will be more coordinated, more strategic, better funded and will have the benefit of doing this work for a number of years. I’m deeply concerned about the future health of our democracy. Democrats Move to Fulfill Biden’s Election Promise on Healthcare ‘Public Option’ Two Congressional Democrats are pushing to create a “public option” for healthcare coverage to compete with private health insurance plans, and aim to introduce legislation by the end of the year, NBC News reports. The health insurance public option, a Biden campaign pledge, was “billed as a moderate alternative to rival Bernie Sanders’ plan to scrap private coverage and put all Americans in Medicare”, per NBC. There will be plenty of opposition, and the bill will be “very tough to pass”, NBC’s Sahil Kapur reports. A majority of Americans think discrimination against Asian Americans has increased over the past year, and many are concerned that incidents of violence are up as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, the Associated Press reports. Most Asian Americans feel unsafe in public because of their race at least sometimes. Only 16% of White Americans who responded to the survey described feeling unsafe in public at least sometimes because of their race, compared with 57% of Asian Americans, 63% of Black Americans, and 44% of Hispanic Americans. The nationwide poll of 1,842 adults was conducted between 20 April and 3 May. More details on the survey methodology here. Insurrection math: will enough Republicans support a 6 January commission? Will enough Republican senators break with their party to support the creation of a 9/11-style commission to investigate how a mob of Trump supporters broke into a poorly-defended Capitol building on 6 January, forcing lawmakers of both parties to flee? NBC News’ Sahil Kapur is tracking senators’ statements on the issue, and created a useful emoji infographic: Susan Collins, the Maine Republican who has come out in support of the commission, also has some proposed changes in how it would operate: Democrats fight over bill that would reform the military’s approach to sexual assault Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a New York Democrat, has made the problem of sexual assault in the military one of her key policy issues. She’s now fighting against another Democrat, Senator Jack Reed, to get a vote on her bipartisan legislation, which would change military law to take authority for deciding military sexual assault cases out of the control of military commanders. The change has attracted support from key Republicans, including Senator Joni Ernst, who has spoken out about her own experience of sexual assault. But it’s being blocked by Reed, the Democratic chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Politico reports. More context here from The Hill: In response to rising homicides, the justice department focuses on prevention This is Lois Beckett, picking up our live US politics coverage from Los Angeles. Homicides surged across the United States during the coronavirus pandemic, in what could be the worst single-year increase in killings in decades. While final national data will not be available for months, one expert estimates the country may have seen an estimated 4000 additional murders in 2020, compared with 2019. Biden’s justice department announced its new violent crime strategy today. Department officials who briefed reporters ahead of the announcement emphasized the importance of non-law enforcement prevention programs, and made clear that US attorneys across the country would not be allowed to measure their success simply in terms of how many people they locked up, rather than whether there was evidence that violence was actually falling. The officials who briefed reporters emphasized principles and rhetoric straight out of the decades of academic research on violence prevention, including the importance of focusing on the relatively tiny number of people and places responsible for the majority of fatal violence. The Guardian investigated the intense concentration of America’s gun violence problem in 2017, and explored the strategies behind the dramatic decline in murders in California’s Bay Area in 2019. That’s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Lois Beckett, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here’s where the day stands so far: Joe Biden has asked the intelligence community to “redouble” its efforts to study the origins of coronavirus. The president is requesting a follow-up report on the issue within 90 days. The request comes days after the Wall Street Journal broke the news of a previously undisclosed US intelligence report about three Wuhan researchers being hospitalized with coronavirus-like symptoms in November 2019. The report intensified speculation that the virus started spreading as a result of a laboratory accident. A shooting at a railyard in San Jose, California, left eight people dead, in addition to the shooter, who was identified as an employee of the Valley Transportation Authority. Biden has been briefed on the shooting, and vice-President Kamala Harris described it as “absolutely tragic”. US diplomats sent a letter to the state department complaining that those with “Havana syndrome” are being denied proper care, according to NBC News. The diplomats are calling for the Biden administration to take the condition more seriously, NBC reported. Senate Republicans will soon propose a counteroffer in the ongoing negotiations over an infrastructure package. The Republican negotiators are expected to propose spending $1tn on an infrastructure bill, which is still far less than the $1.7tn that Biden called for last week, when he issued his own counteroffer. Karine Jean-Pierre made history as the first openly gay person and the second Black woman to ever hold a White House briefing. The principal deputy White House press secretary held her first formal briefing with reporters this afternoon. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. “Hi, everybody! Welcome!” So, with a rustle of papers, began a new chapter in the White House briefing room on Wednesday when Karine Jean-Pierre became the first openly gay person to address reporters on behalf of the US president. She was also the first Black woman to do so since Judy Smith, a deputy press secretary for President George H W Bush – and inspiration for Olivia Pope in the TV drama Scandal – stood at the podium some 30 years ago. The briefing was widely seen as an audition by Jean-Pierre, who is currently principal deputy press secretary, for the top job of presidential spokesperson. The incumbent, Jen Psaki, who has been briefing almost daily, said recently she intends to leave the post after a year. Did Jean-Pierre pass the audition? Joe Biden will be the ultimate judge of that but it would fair to say that she observed the first rule for press secretaries: do no harm. Her replies were noncommittal, uncontroversial and not likely to generate unwanted headlines. Vice-President Kamala Harris, a former senator of California, described today’s mass shooting in San Jose as “absolutely tragic”. Speaking at the beginning of a meeting with members of Congress on investing in broadband infrastructure, Harris noted she has family members who live in San Jose and has worked with the mayor and police department there. “My prayers and my thoughts are with all of those families affected,” Harris told reporters. Joe Biden has been briefed on the mass shooting today at a railyard in San Jose, California, the White House said in a statement to the press pool. “The President has been briefed on the mass shooting and the tragic loss of life in San Jose by his Homeland Security Advisor, Liz Sherwood-Randall. The White House continues to monitor the situation and remains in close contact with local officials to offer any assistance as needed,” the statement said. Local authorities said eight people were killed in the attack, in addition to the shooter, who was identified as an employee of the Valley Transportation Authority. Multiple other people were injured in the shooting, and a police spokesperson warned the death toll could still rise. US diplomats and other officials experiencing symptoms that appear to be consistent with the unexplained brain injury known as Havana Syndrome have written a letter to the US state department saying those affected are being denied appropriate care. NBC News, which obtained the letter, reports that staffers have claimed that the Biden administration has continued to “invalidate our injuries and experiences,” and they are calling for the condition to be treated more seriously. Last month, The New York Times reported that there had been more than 130 incidents of Havana syndrome among US diplomats, spies and defence officials, some of them very recently. The Times said three CIA officers had reported serious symptoms since December, following overseas assignments. The Guardian’s world affairs editor, Julian Borger, reported at the time: In December, the National Academy of Sciences published a report saying that the brain injuries suffered by US government employees in Cuba and China were most likely the result of some form of directed energy. Cheryl Rofer, a former chemist at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, has questioned the study’s conclusions, and the claim by victims and some experts that some kind of microwave weapon developed by an adversary is responsible for Havana syndrome. ‘The evidence for microwave effects of the type categorized as Havana syndrome is exceedingly weak,’ Rofer wrote in Foreign Policy. Republican Senator Tim Scott said Congress must reach a deal on the policing reform bill next month, as bipartisan negotiations over the legislation continue. “It’s June or bust,” Scott told a PBS Newshour reporter. “We’ve got three weeks in June to get this done.” Scott is one of three lawmakers, along with Democratic congresswoman Karen Bass and Democratic Senator Cory Booker, who are involved in the negotiations over the bill. Joe Biden had originally said he hoped to sign the bill by the one-year anniversary of the death of George Floyd, the Black man who was murdered by a white Minneapolis police officer last May. But that anniversary came and went yesterday without a final deal on the policing bill. Biden met yesterday with some of Floyd’s family members, who urged Congress to pass the legislation as quickly as possible. Speaking to reporters this afternoon, deputy White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said policing reform remains a “top priority” for the president. “He is going to continue to work on this today, tomorrow and every day,” Jean-Pierre said. President Joe Biden has paid tribute to former Virginia Republican senator John Warner who died on Tuesday aged 94, saying he “lived an extraordinary life of service and accomplishment”. In a statement issued Wednesday, Biden said: “I had the privilege of serving alongside John in the Senate for three decades. The John Warner I knew was guided by two things: his conscience and our Constitution. And, when acting in accordance with both, he neither wavered in his convictions nor was concerned with the consequences.” He added: “When told that if he voted in a way that was not in line with his party’s position—as he did numerous times on issues of rational gun policy, women’s rights, and judicial nominees—that “people would say,” his favorite rejoinder was, “Let ‘em say it.” “Indeed, that was his response when, in one of the great honors of my career, he crossed party lines to support me in the 2020 election.” Biden ended the statement by saying “our hearts and prayers are with his family”. The White House is reportedly finalizing plans for president Joe Biden to meet with Queen Elizabeth II during his first trip abroad next month, according to CNN. “This face-to-face greeting, during which Biden would be joined by first lady Jill Biden, is expected to take place before the president leaves the United Kingdom following the Group of 7 summit,” CNN reported, citing an unnamed US official. The official reportedly said the White House and Buckingham Palace were finalizing details on Wednesday, and an announcement was expected in the coming days. The Queen, who is 95 years-old and is the world’s longest-reigning monarch, has met every US president since Harry Truman, with the exception of Lyndon Johnson. If the meeting goes ahead, Biden would be the 13th American president she has met. Karine Jean-Pierre indicated the Biden administration will also continue to press the World Health Organization to gather information on the origins of coronavirus. “We’ve been very clear with the WHO to continue to get to the bottom of this,” the deputy press secretary said. “We’re going to continue working with the WHO.” Jean-Pierre noted Joe Biden brought the US back into the WHO after Donald Trump withdrew from the organization, and she said the president made that decision partly to hold the group accountable when it comes to investigating the origins of coronavirus. The White House press briefing has now concluded. A reporter pressed Karine Jean-Pierre on what has changed recently to make Joe Biden call for a 90-day intelligence community review of the potential origins of coronavirus. The New York Times reporter noted that Jean-Pierre’s boss, press secretary Jen Psaki, had been emphasizing the World Health Organization’s investigation (rather than a domestic investigation) as recently as last week. Jean-Pierre insisted nothing has changed in recent days, telling reporters, “We don’t speak about everything under review.” Biden’s announcement came days after the Wall Street Journal broke news of a previously undisclosed US intelligence report about three Wuhan researchers being hospitalized with coronavirus-like symptoms in November 2019, intensifying speculation that the virus spread as the result of a lab accident. Asked if the US intelligence community has ruled out the possibility of a deliberate release of coronavirus, Karine Jean-Pierre replied, “We haven’t ruled out anything yet.” The deputy White House press secretary repeatedly emphasized that the administration will have more information to offer on the investigation into the origins of coronavirus once the 90-day intelligence community review is completed. Jean-Pierre repeatedly criticized China for not being transparent with its information on the origins of the virus, echoing comments from other senior administration officials and international leaders. Deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked about the White House’s response to the shooting this morning at a railyard in San Jose, California. “Our hearts go out to the victims and their families,” Jean-Pierre said. “There is an ongoing investigation, as we all know. We will continue to stay in close contact with them and offer any assistance as needed.” San Jose officials have just confirmed that eight people died in the shooting, in addition to the shooter, who reportedly died by suicide after the attack. A police spokesperson warned that the number of victims could change, as multiple other people were injured in the attack. One reporter asked Karine Jean-Pierre to reflect on her history-making appearance at the White House briefing room podium today. “It’s a real honor to just be standing here today. I appreciate the historic nature” of this moment, the deputy White House press secretary said. But Jean-Pierre emphasized that this administration is not about any one person and is instead focused on the collective efforts to improve American lives. She also promised to be “truthful” and “transparent” while speaking to the press. “Clearly, the president believes representation matters, and I appreciate him giving me this opportunity,” Jean-Pierre said. No surprise here: the first questions at the White House briefing focused on Joe Biden’s announcement that he is asking the intelligence community to “redouble” efforts to study the origins of coronavirus. Deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre would not say whether the report will be made public when it is completed. “We’ll have more to share after the 90 days,” Jean-Pierre said, referring to the deadline set by the president for completing the report. Deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre is now holding her first formal briefing with reporters in the White House briefing room. Jean-Pierre’s appearance at the briefing room podium makes her just the second Black woman to hold a White House briefing, after Judy Smith did so 30 years ago while serving in George HW Bush’s administration. Jean-Pierre has been mentioned as a potential successor to press secretary Jen Psaki, who has said she only wants to stay in the job for one year. if Jean-Pierre were selected to succeed Psaki, she would be the first Black woman to serve as White House press secretary. Testifying before a Senate appropriations subcommittee today, Dr Anthony Fauci reiterated that he is “very much in favor” of further investigation into the origins of coronavirus. Fauci, the president’s chief medical adviser, and some of his colleagues from the National Institutes of Health said they still believed coronavirus most likely came about from human contact with an infected animal. Fauci told Republican Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith, “I feel the likelihood is still high that this is a natural occurrence, but since you cannot know 100% whether it is or is not -- other possibilities exist -- and for that reason, I and my colleagues have been saying that we are very much in favor of a further investigation.” Here’s where the day stands so far: Joe Biden has asked the intelligence community to “redouble” its efforts to study the origins of coronavirus. The president is requesting a follow-up report on the issue within 90 days. The request comes days after the Wall Street Journal broke the news of a previously undisclosed US intelligence report about three Wuhan researchers being hospitalized with coronavirus-like symptoms in November 2019. The report intensified speculation that the virus started spreading as a result of a laboratory accident. A shooting at a railyard in San Jose, California, left multiple people dead. Authorities said the shooting resulted in “multiple injuries and multiple fatalities,” and the shooter is now dead. The victims include Valley Transportation Authority employees. Senate Republicans will soon propose a counteroffer in the ongoing negotiations over an infrastructure package. The Republican negotiators are expected to propose spending $1 trillion on an infrastructure bill, which is still far less than the $1.7 trillion that Biden called for last week, when he issued his own counteroffer. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Joe Biden’s request to intensify the investigation into the origins of coronavirus comes days after the Wall Street Journal reported on a previously undisclosed US intelligence report about three Wuhan researchers being hospitalized with coronavirus-like symptoms in November 2019. The report intensified speculation that coronavirus may have spread as a result of a laboratory accident in China. The Journal reported: Three researchers from China’s Wuhan Institute of Virology became sick enough in November 2019 that they sought hospital care, according to a previously undisclosed U.S. intelligence report that could add weight to growing calls for a fuller probe of whether the Covid-19 virus may have escaped from the laboratory. The details of the reporting go beyond a State Department fact sheet, issued during the final days of the Trump administration, which said that several researchers at the lab, a center for the study of coronaviruses and other pathogens, became sick in autumn 2019 ‘with symptoms consistent with both Covid-19 and common seasonal illness.’ ... Current and former officials familiar with the intelligence about the lab researchers expressed differing views about the strength of the supporting evidence for the assessment. One person said that it was provided by an international partner and was potentially significant but still in need of further investigation and additional corroboration. Another person described the intelligence as stronger. ‘The information that we had coming from the various sources was of exquisite quality. It was very precise. What it didn’t tell you was exactly why they got sick,’ he said, referring to the researchers. Joe Biden has asked the US intelligence community to “redouble” its efforts to study the origins of coronavirus. The president said he received a report earlier this month with the “most up-to-date analysis of the origins of COVID-19,” and he has asked for additional follow-up within 90 days. Biden noted that the US intelligence community has not yet coalesced around a common theory as to whether coronavirus came about from human contact with an infected animal or from a laboratory accident. “I have now asked the Intelligence Community to redouble their efforts to collect and analyze information that could bring us closer to a definitive conclusion, and to report back to me in 90 days. As part of that report, I have asked for areas of further inquiry that may be required, including specific questions for China,” Biden said. The president said he has also asked the intelligence community to keep Congress apprised of its work on this matter. “The United States will also keep working with like-minded partners around the world to press China to participate in a full, transparent, evidence-based international investigation and to provide access to all relevant data and evidence,” Biden said. Deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre will soon hold her first formal briefing in the White House briefing room. Jean-Pierre is only the second Black woman to lead a briefing in the briefing room, after Judy Smith did so 30 years ago while serving in George HW Bush’s administration. Symone Sanders, who serves as chief spokesperson for Vice-President Kamala Harris, congratulated Jean-Pierre on the significant moment. “I will be raising my coffee cup during the WH press briefing in celebration of representation, aptitude and brilliance,” Sanders said on Twitter. “The ancestors are proud.” The suspect in the San Jose shooting died by suicide, according to CBS News. It’s still unclear how many people were killed in the attack, although a sheriff’s office spokesperson confirmed there were “multiple fatalities”. Guardian staff and agencies report: The San Jose shooting took place at a light rail facility that is nextdoor to the Santa Clara county sheriff’s department and across a freeway from the airport. The facility is a transit control center that stores trains and has a maintenance yard. A spokesperson for the Valley Transportation Authority did not immediately respond to multiple requests for comment. A shooting at a railyard in San Jose, California, has left multiple people dead and several others injured, a spokesperson for the Santa Clara County sheriff’s office said. The spokesperson would not say the exact number of victims, but he confirmed to reporters that there were “multiple injuries and multiple fatalities” from the shooting. The victims include Valley Transportation Authority employees. The mayor of San Jose, Sam Liccardo, previously said on Twitter that the shooter is now dead and the facility has been evacuated. He said more information would be made available in about 30 minutes. California Governor Gavin Newsom also said in a tweet that he is closely monitoring the situation and remains in contact with local law enforcement officials. Second gentleman Douglas Emhoff will travel tomorrow to Albuquerque, New Mexico, the White House has just announced. According to Politico, the vice-president’s husband is traveling to the state to campaign for Melanie Stansbury, the Democratic congressional candidate who is running to fill Interior Secretary Deb Haaland’s seat in the House. Politico reports: The second gentleman will be heading to New Mexico to campaign with Democratic congressional candidate Melanie Stansbury ahead of the special election on Tuesday, according to two sources with knowledge of the planning. An administration official says the event will take place on Thursday. ... This won’t be the first political event for Emhoff who joined DNC Chair Jaime Harrison in March for the latter’s first virtual fundraiser. It is, however, his first campaign event since the November election. Emhoff is no stranger to the trail. He was a mainstay of Vice President Kamala Harris’ primary bid and did solo events during the general election after she joined the Biden ticket. Joe Biden endorsed Stansbury in a statement yesterday, saying she has “the grit and determination to deliver real results for all New Mexicans”. The seat is considered safely Democratic, given that Biden won it by 23 points in November. New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft has denied allegations he and Donald Trump attempted to pay a senator money in order to drop an investigation into a cheating scandal involving the team. According to a report published on Wednesday by ESPN, Trump met with late senator Arlen Specter in 2008 and offered him “money in Palm Beach” if he dropped his investigation into the Spygate scandal, in which the Patriots were disciplined by the NFL for filming a rival team’s coaching signals. Trump had not started his political career at the time and was well-known as the star of reality show The Apprentice. ESPN says Trump was acting on behalf of Kraft, a claim those close to the former president and the team deny. “This [report] is completely false,” Jason Miller, a senior adviser to Trump, told ESPN when asked about the story. “We have no idea what you’re talking about.” A spokesman for the Patriots also denied the allegations to ESPN. “Mr Kraft is not aware of any involvement of Trump on this topic and he did not have any other engagement with Specter or his staff,” the spokesman said via email. Specter was senator for Pennsylvania at the time and ran as a Democrat and Republican during his political career. He was also a personal friend of Trump. Trump himself has been on friendly terms with several prominent members of the Patriots including Kraft, head coach Bill Belichick and former quarterback Tom Brady. Both Brady and Belichick have distanced themselves from Trump recently. In January, following the US Capitol invasion, Belichick turned down Trump’s offer of the presidential medal of freedom. Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer said the flags around the Senate side of the US Capitol will be lowered to half-staff in honor of the late senator John Warner, who died last night at the age of 94. “On behalf of the Senate, I want to express our condolences to his family and his friends, and our gratitude for amazing service to America throughout his life,” the Democratic leader said in a floor speech moments ago. Virginia Governor Ralph Northam described the late senator John Warner as “the best of what public service and elected leadership should be”. “Virginia, and America, have lost a giant,” the Democratic governor said in a statement. “As a sailor, a senator, a statesman, and a gentleman, former U.S. Senator John Warner spent his life in public service.” Northam offered his prayers to Warner’s family members as they mourn his death at the age of 94. “John helped build up his political party and always remained an independent voice. He used that voice in the Senate to forge bipartisan compromise, knowing how and when to reach across the aisle. And he always put Virginia first,” Northam said. “Our prayers for comfort go out to his wife Jeanne, his three children, grandchildren, scores of friends, and all those who loved him.” John Warner, the longtime former Republican senator of Virginia who clashed with George W Bush over the Iraq War, has died of heart failure at 94. Reuters reports: Warner died late on Tuesday, with his wife and daughter at his side, his chief of staff, Susan Magill, said in an email to family and friends, according to a Politico report on Wednesday. The Washington Post said he died in Alexandria, Virginia. Warner was an influential voice in Congress on military policy and served in the US Senate for five terms from 1979 to 2009. He was also the sixth husband of the actor Elizabeth Taylor. A former chairman of the Senate armed services committee, Warner openly criticized President George W Bush’s handling of the Iraq war and called on him in 2007 to begin withdrawing US troops from Iraq. The decision put Warner in the center of a growing debate in Congress over the conflict. Warner spent months trying to develop an approach to US policy in Iraq that was supported by Republicans and Democrats. Lawmakers of both parties responded to the news of Warner’s death by offering admiring condolence messages to the his family. Current Virginia Senator Mark Warner, who was not related to the late senator, said of him, “John Warner was a consummate statesman and a public servant who always put Virginia before politics; who put the nation’s security before partisanship; who put the country’s needs above his own.” When deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre holds her first formal White House briefing this afternoon, she will be only the second Black woman to ever do so, according to a CBS News reporter. Alexandra Villarreal reports on how white male minority rule has overtaken US politics: From county officials and sheriffs to governors and senators, white male minority rule pervades politics in the United States, according to a new report published on Wednesday. White men represent 30% of the population but 62% of officeholders, dominating both chambers of Congress, 42 state legislatures and statewide roles across the nation, the analysis shows. By contrast, women and people of color constitute 51% and 40% of the US population respectively, but just 31% and 13% of officeholders, according to the research by the Reflective Democracy Campaign, shared exclusively with the Guardian. “I think if we saw these numbers in another country, we would say there is something very wrong with that political system,” said Brenda Choresi Carter, the campaign’s director. “We would say, ‘how could that possibly be a democratic system with that kind of demographic mismatch?’” Read Alexandra’s full report here: Today will also mark an important first at the White House. Principal deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre will be doing her first full briefing from the briefing room podium this afternoon. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Twitter, “Today is a big day in the press office and @WhiteHouse. My partner in truth--@KJP46 is doing her first full briefing from the podium today making history in her own right. But doing her real justice means also recognizing her talent, her brilliance and her wonderful spirit.” Jean-Pierre has done briefings with reporters aboard Air Force One before, usually as the president flies across the country promoting his American Rescue Plan or American Jobs Plan. But this will be her first official appearance at the briefing room podium. Reporters will be watching Jean-Pierre closely because she has been suggested as a potential successor to Psaki, who has indicated she only wants to serve as press secretary for one year. If Jean-Pierre did get the job, she would be the first Black woman to hold the post. Joe Biden has reportedly signaled to Republican senators working on infrastructure negotiations that he would be willing to accept a $1 trillion counteroffer. CNN reports: Two key GOP negotiators -- Sens. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and Roger Wicker of Mississippi -- both indicated on Tuesday that Biden has signaled openness to that price tag, a reason why they plan to make a counteroffer around that amount on Thursday, even as there are still sharp disagreements on how to pay for the massive proposal. ‘The President indicated he would accept that number,’ Wicker told CNN, referring to $1 trillion. The upcoming Senate GOP offer is a sign that negotiations with the White House aren’t over yet even as talks are teetering on the edge ahead of a Memorial Day deadline. GOP negotiators met Tuesday behind closed doors, telling reporters that they planned to offer a new infrastructure proposal Thursday that will approach $1 trillion in part because they believe the two sides could find agreement there. ‘He used that figure with us, yes,’ Capito said when asked if Biden showed a willingness to accept a $1 trillion proposal, adding that the President also suggested a package of investments over an eight-year time frame. ‘We’re responding to what he proposed.’ The White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, would not confirm yesterday whether Biden had signaled he would be comfortable with $1 trillion as the topline number for the infrastructure package. “I’m not going to read any more specifics of a private conversation,” Psaki told reporters. “But I will just reiterate that the proposal put forward last Friday, that we put out transparently to all of you, that brought the price tag down by $550 billion was directed, signed off on by the president of the United States.” Greetings from Washington, live blog readers. Senate Republicans are expected to propose a counteroffer tomorrow in the ongoing negotiations over an infrastructure package, and their plan is expected to cost around $1 trillion. “We’re going to hit a figure very close to what the president said he would accept, and it will end up being the most substantial infrastructure bill ever enacted by the federal government,” Republican Senator Roger Wicker told reporters yesterday. “And if the president gets to make the decision, he will accept it.” The new offer comes almost a week after Joe Biden proposed a smaller infrastructure bill than he had originally proposed, lowering the overall cost of his plan from $2.25 trillion to $1.7 trillion. Republicans complained that price tag was still too high for them, but Democrats have insisted the plan must include items like massive investments in green energy, which the Republican plans have largely omitted. If Biden does not like Republicans’ latest offer, Democrats could still try to pass an infrastructure bill using reconciliation, thus avoiding a Senate filibuster. But Democrats’ key 50th Senate vote, Joe Manchin, may not be on board for that, so all eyes will be on the Republicans’ as they propose their counteroffer. The blog will have more details on the Republican offer coming up, so stay tuned.","charCount":"41339","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/lois-beckett\">Lois Beckett</a> in Los Angeles and <a href=\"profile/joan-greve\">Joan E Greve</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}

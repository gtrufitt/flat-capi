Philippines has suspended the deployment of workers to Saudi Arabia after it received reports that their employers and recruiters were making them pay for Covid-19 testing, quarantine and insurance upon arrival in the kingdom. Reuters report that Labour Secretary Silvestre Bello said in an order that his department will issue an official statement on resumption of deployment ‚Äúafter this matter has been clarified accordingly‚Äù. It was not immediately clear how many Filipinos bound for Saudi Arabia would be directly affected. Saudi Arabia was the most preferred destination of overseas Filipino workers in 2019, government data showed, hosting one out of five Filipinos who landed jobs abroad during that year. The Scott Morrison government in Australia was scrambling to administer first doses of Covid vaccines to unvaccinated aged care homes across Victoria on the first day of a week-long lockdown, as federal ministers rejected criticism of the programme‚Äôs rollout. Facilities hurriedly prepared residents for rushed vaccines on Friday as the commonwealth raced to vaccinate neglected populations within the highest priority group it had initially promised to two months ago. The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, had said on Thursday there were 74 residential aged care homes across Australia that had not yet received an initial dose of Covid vaccine, including 16 in Victoria. But he went on a media blitz on Friday morning insisting every aged care home in the state would have received at least one dose by the weekend. The government‚Äôs push to vaccinate the remaining aged care homes in Victoria came a day after Hunt announced the recommended two-week interval between flu and Covid shots would be scrapped for aged care settings in Victoria. The operator of one aged care home in Melbourne, who asked not to be identified, told Guardian Australia they were surprised to learn vaccination teams were being sent to their facility on Friday. It presented logistical hurdles to prepare residents at such short notice, they said. Read more here: Federal government scrambles to vaccinate Victorian aged care homes as state enters first day of lockdown My colleague Haroon Siddique has a fuller write-up of those quotes from the UK business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng that we were carrying on this blog earlier: Kwasi Kwarteng defends Hancock over Covid care home claims As a reminder, UK Covid news is now being blogged by Harry Taylor over here: A royal academy chaired by Princess Chulabhorn, the youngest sibling of Thailand‚Äôs king, has said it would import 1m doses of Sinopharm‚Äôs Covid-19 vaccine next month, after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorised its use. The announcement in the official Royal Gazette surprised some members of the government, which had until now insisted on being the sole importer of Covid-19 vaccines. The FDA on Friday approved the Sinopharm coronavirus vaccine for emergency use, making it the fifth authorised by Thailand after AstraZenaca, Sinovac‚Äôs CoronaVac, Johnson &amp; Johnson‚Äôs Janssen and Moderna ‚ÄúWe want to help plug in the gaps for business, schools, so they can move forward,‚Äù Nithi Mahanonda, secretarygeneral of the Chulabhorn Royal Academy told a news briefing. Reuters report that earlier this week, the academy announced it would import ‚Äúalternative vaccines‚Äù to supplement the government campaign. The government says it will have 6m AstraZenaca doses and 3 million Sinovac doses available in June. Just over 1 million of Thailand‚Äôs more than 66 million people are fully vaccinated. Nithi said other organisations would be able to buy from the academy‚Äôs 1m Sinopharm doses, adding that it did not seek profit. Greece has said it is ready to use a Covid-19 travel certificate before its EU-wide launch on 1 July to attract foreign travellers and save its tourism sector from a second summer lost to the coronavirus. The free certificate will take the form of a QR code on a smartphone or paper, letting authorities determine the status of a visitor based on records in their home EU country. Greece was one of the early advocates of a certificate that would ease European Union travel curbs and help pull the country‚Äôs economy from recession by lifting tourism revenues. The European Council and parliament last week reached a deal on the digital green certificate following a rapid pick-up of vaccinations allowing widespread lifting of coronavirus curbs. The European parliament is expected to pass a law in the week from 7 June and more than a dozen EU countries, including France and Spain, have agreed to test the system before a launch on 1 July. The certificate would show if a person had received a vaccine, had a recent negative test or had immunity based on recovery. ‚ÄúIt is very, very simple. Essentially, it includes all the information that a member-state would need to welcome a traveller without imposing additional restrictions,‚Äù Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said at a presentation of the pass on Friday. Lefteris Papadimas and Angeliki Koutantou report for Reuters that Mitsotakis added: ‚ÄúGreece is ready to launch this digital certificate earlier than 1 July.‚Äù He called on EU countries to ensure they stick to the deadlines and facilitate travel over the summer. In a separate event in the northern Spanish city of Soria, Spanish prime minister Pedro S√°nchez also confirmed his country would take part in the trials from 7 June. ‚ÄúThis will be decisive in getting the certificate ready before summer begins and is big news for our tourism industry.‚Äù South Africa is in a race against time to vaccinate as many people as possible amid signs the virus may be surging again with the approach of winter in the southern hemisphere, when people spend more time indoors, typically allowing for more spread of disease. It is also a critical front in the fight against the virus in Africa, with South Africa recording 40% of the continent‚Äôs Covid-19 deaths. Since January, South Africa has vaccinated nearly 500,000 of its 1.2 million healthcare workers and now is adding its older citizens to the campaign. In the past two weeks, nearly 200,000 have received their Pfizer jabs with instructions to come back in six weeks to get their second dose. After a plateau of the disease that lasted a few months, South Africa‚Äôs new cases, hospitalisations and deaths are trending up. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases has risen over the past two weeks from 3.33 per 100,000 people on 12 May to 3.97 per 100,000 on Wednesday, according to Johns Hopkins University. The seven-day rolling average of deaths is also on the rise: from 0.10 deaths per 100,000 people to 0.11 per 100,000 over the same period. The increase may seem small, but experts warn it may be the start of a resurgence as the country enters the colder winter months, which start in June. The national coronavirus task force met this week and President Cyril Ramaphosa‚Äôs government is pondering the possibility of reimposing restrictions, such as reducing the hours that alcohol can be sold and limiting the number of people at gatherings. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre under pressure to reach higher levels of vaccination,‚Äù Mosa Moshabela, professor of public health at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, told the Associated Press. ‚ÄúNew vaccination centers are opening every day and the numbers being given shots should quickly go from 20,000 elderly per day to 50,000 and then 100,000 per day,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBy June we should reach 200,000 per day. We need to have that kind of volume to get close to vaccinating 5 million elderly by the end of June.‚Äù South Africa‚Äôs overall goal is to vaccinate 67% of its 60 million people by February. Czech restaurants will open to indoor diners from Monday, health minister Adam Vojtech said this morning, announcing a quicker-than-planned easing of Covid-19 restrictions. Reuters report that the Czech Republic will also open up to tourists from seven countries ‚Äì Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia, Croatia, Austria and Germany ‚Äì under reciprocal agreements. Harry Taylor is on our UK live blog duties this morning, and he‚Äôs just got that started for the day. If you are after UK news, then you can follow that with him here ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll be continuing here with the latest global coronavirus news. The deputy prime minister of Ireland, Leo Varadkar, has said that Irish citizens should be able move more freely across the European Union from mid-July, but cast doubt on whether it would also apply to Britain. ‚ÄúThe advice that we have, and we‚Äôre accepting this advice, is that there are real concerns about the Indian variant and for that reason, we‚Äôre not in a position to restore the common travel area just yet,‚Äù Varadkar told national broadcaster RTE. Reuters report he said there would continue to be restrictions for arrivals from Britain, including requirements to have a vaccine or a negative Covid-19 test, even once travel opens up using the EU‚Äôs ‚Äúgreen certificate‚Äù. Very quick snap from Reuters that a Japanese health ministry panel has approved the use of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine for those aged 12 and above. The move, which lowers the threshold from 16, follows approvals in the US and other nations this month for the vaccine to be used for adolescents. On the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, UK business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng was pushed on the issue of people being discharged from hospital to care homes without testing. He was fairly steadfast in repeatedly saying that testing capacity had to be built from scratch, and that is what Matt Hancock and the department did. Weeks into Taiwan‚Äôs worst outbreak since the pandemic began, and 10 days after the island was put on the third highest level of social restrictions, daily totals of new cases are still not decreasing, the health minister has conceded. In today‚Äôs daily press conference, minister Chen Chih-shung reported 19 new deaths, 297 new cases and an additional 258 cases from a backlog of cases stretching as far as 10 days. He said the trends appeared stable, and were not rising, but the fact they were not visibly decreasing suggested there was still unidentified spread. The 19 deaths is the third consecutive record for daily fatalities. Taiwan is currently on alert level 3, of a four-tier system. Recreation, entertainment and sporting venues have closed, restaurants ordered to do take-away only, and working from home encouraged but not enforced. The backlog of cases has made assessment of trends - and the effectiveness of the response measures - difficult, with up to 95 cases at a time being added to previous daily totals. For the first time in this outbreak, Chen has flagged a possible move to level 4, requiring a lockdown. Until now he has said it would not happen unless there were 14 consecutive days of more than 100 cases (which has happened) and a rate of at least 50% untraced (which has not happened). He said they need to get a clearer picture of the trends, and would have more information early next week. Chen also announced local governments would be allowed to facilitate their own vaccine purchases, with FDA approval, acknowledging the central government‚Äôs processes were not procuring fast enough to meet Taiwan‚Äôs needs in the context of the current outbreak. About 330,000 people have received at least one vaccine so far, from a population of 24 million. Taiwan‚Äôs hospitals have also been told to double their Covid patient capacity by allowing two patients to a room, instead of one. A ‚Ç¨2.5bn (¬£2.15bn) package has been agreed by the German government to help the culture industry get back on its feet as the country slowly emerges from a third wave of the Covid pandemic. The finance minister, Olaf Scholz, has called the package ‚Äúthe biggest cultural subsidy programme‚Äù since the end of the second world war. The coronavirus cultural fund is intended to give organisers of events assurances that they will be compensated if performances and concerts are not able to go ahead as planned, as well as making up for the loss of ticket sales due to reduced seating as a result of social distancing regulations. Initially the measures will protect events of up to 500 participants, so that if from 1 July an event has to be cancelled, the organiser will be fully compensated. From the end of August, in anticipation of events being able to increase in size, that will go up to 2,000 participants. The measures, coming as Germany starts to open up after months of tight restrictions, are on top of a multimillion-euro neustart kultur (new start culture) programme announced last year to cover events across the country. ‚ÄúLife is starting again after a long coronavirus winter,‚Äù Scholz said. Monika Gr√ºtters, the culture minister, said the fund sent a signal to the cultural industry that its ‚Äúresuscitation deserves the same amount of effort which is being given to other branches‚Äù. Read more of Kate Connolly‚Äôs report from Berlin: Germany agrees ‚Ç¨2.5bn package to help revive Covid-hit culture sector Yesterday UK housing minister Robert Jenrick was touting next spring as a possible starting date for a Covid inquiry. Opposition Labour MP David Lammy has just joined calls to rapidly bring that date forward in the light of the revelations from Dominic Cummings earlier in the week. Meanwhile on LBC, shock-jock Nick Ferrari has been lambasting business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng saying he should be ‚Äúkicking the door down‚Äù of the prime minister, ‚Äúbanging the desk and saying ‚ÄòWe have got to stick to 21 June, prime minister!‚Äô‚Äù. Kwarteng replies ‚ÄúYou know what Nick, that‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôm doing.‚Äù The rest of his answer doesn‚Äôt make it sound like he is doing that, however, as he reiterates form his earlier media appearances that ‚ÄúWhat I can‚Äôt do is give guarantees on the 28 May‚Äù and continues to hold the line that the government will be following the data and there will not be a decision until 14 June. Mario Koran reports for us from Milwaukee that Wisconsin is the ground zero of America‚Äôs battle against vaccine hesitancy: Vaccination rates in Wisconsin vary widely between rural and urban areas and political, religious and racial divides ‚Äì a pattern that mirrors the divide across the nation. In the progressive stronghold of Dane county ‚Äì home to the University of Wisconsin-Madison ‚Äì more than 65% of the population has received one dose. In the state‚Äôs rural north, Taylor county has vaccinated only 23.5% of the population, state data shows. Vaccine availability once posed the biggest barrier to immunization. But as availability increased, demand plateaued. Now, healthcare professionals are strategizing ways to reach those who haven‚Äôt yet been vaccinated but remain open to it. ‚ÄúMost of our rural residents have the information they need about where and when to get vaccinated. So this is no longer primarily an issue about access to the vaccine. It truly is an issue of what is commonly called vaccine hesitancy,‚Äù said Tim Size, executive director of the Rural Wisconsin Health Cooperative, a network of 43 rural hospitals. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not talking about those who just say hell will freeze over before they get the vaccine. That‚Äôs not where I think any of us probably need to spend our energy because it‚Äôs unlikely to get much traction. I‚Äôm talking about the number of people who are communicating that they‚Äôre not quite ready yet, but with more information and conversation, they may get there.‚Äù Read more of Mario Koran‚Äôs report from Milwaukee here: Wisconsin: ground zero of America‚Äôs battle against vaccine hesitancy Prof Christina Pagel, from University College London and a member of Independent Sage, said the India variant was causing concern and the road map should be delayed. She told BBC Radio 4‚Äôs Today programme: ‚ÄúCertainly we have weakened the link significantly between cases and hospitalisations, but we haven‚Äôt broken it.‚Äù She added: ‚ÄúWe now have fewer restrictions in England than we‚Äôve had since the pandemic started, so if enough people get infected, even a really small proportion who need hospital can still end up being quite large absolute numbers.‚Äù Asked whether the planned further lockdown easing for 21 June should not go ahead, she said: ‚ÄúSo far we‚Äôve kind of been crossing our fingers a little bit, Sage and Public Health England both say it‚Äôs a more transmissible variant, we know it has some levels of vaccine escape. ‚ÄúSo we‚Äôre in a situation where, compared to two months ago, we now have a dominant variant, it transmits faster, and our vaccines are less effective against it.‚Äù PA Media reports that asked if it would be ‚Äúvery demoralising‚Äù to remain as we are now, she said: ‚ÄúI think what‚Äôs demoralising is having a third wave. If we can just delay international travel, delay stage 4 of the road map until we have a much higher proportion of people vaccinated with two doses, we‚Äôre in a much, much better position. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre only two months away from that, it‚Äôs not long to wait. What I don‚Äôt want is for us to have new restrictions.‚Äù In the UK, business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has become the latest minister to defend health secretary Matt Hancock, saying ‚ÄúVery few people ‚Äì if anyone ‚Äì worked as hard as he did.‚Äù Hancock had an awkward time in front of parliament yesterday following accusations by former government adviser Dominic Cummings that he had lied to colleagues and the public during the early stages of the pandemic. Kwarteng said: ‚ÄúI think what Matt stressed very carefully yesterday was that he was absolutely focused, right from the start of the pandemic, on saving people‚Äôs lives. ‚ÄúHe was in a difficult situation as the Health Secretary, in a pandemic, the like of which we hadn‚Äôt seen for 100 years. He was under huge pressure. ‚ÄúAnd as a Cabinet colleague, I know that he worked really hard and very few people - if anyone - worked as hard as he did and he was very committed to saving lives. Now, he said what he said, I fully believe him but we‚Äôll have an inquiry and that will iron out all these facts.‚Äù Poulomi Ghosh reports for the Hindustan Times on a vaccine mix-up causing concern: At least 20 people in Uttar Pradesh‚Äôs Siddharthnagar district bordering Nepal were administered with different doses of vaccines, in a case of ‚Äúnegligence‚Äù. The 20 people who received two different vaccines in two slots are all from Audahi Kalan village and are aged above 45 years. On 1 April, there were given a dose of Covishield, which was their first dose. On 14 May, they were administered the second dose and as the health workers did not check the card to find out which vaccine was administered to them earlier, they were given Covaxin, by mistake. Reports said none of them reported any adverse effect. There are controlled trials ongoing in some countries of mixing vaccines to see if it increases effectiveness. Murdo Fraser of the Scottish Conservatives has criticised the continued restrictions in place across Glasgow. PA Media reports that he has said if the latest data shows infections are still high then a ‚Äúmore targeted‚Äù approach was needed. Areas of Glasgow with higher concentrations of coronavirus infections should be targeted with testing and vaccinations rather than the whole city being subject to ‚Äúblanket‚Äù restrictions, the Scottish Conservatives have said. Fraser told the BBC‚Äôs Good Morning Scotland: ‚ÄúOur view is the current council-wide lockdown in Glasgow has not been the right approach. ‚ÄúLarge parts of Glasgow do not see large numbers of people infected with Covid and yet are affected by these lockdown restrictions. ‚ÄúIf the data is still showing a specific problem in Glasgow what we should be doing is isolating that problem ‚Ä¶ localised surge testing, accelerating vaccinations in those communities and greater support for local businesses who have been really suffering.‚Äù Glasgow has been under strict coronavirus restrictions for 270 days and is the only part of the country under tougher Level 3 constraints. An update on restrictions in Scotland‚Äôs largest city is expected later today from first minister Nicola Sturgeon. Overcrowding in Victoria‚Äôs healthcare system is a ‚Äúbigger public health emergency than Covid‚Äù, according to a leading emergency physician who says the state‚Äôs doctors and nurses were exhausted even before the latest outbreak. Victoria is in a seven-day lockdown with 30 cases of community transmission, more than 120 exposure sites, and 15,000 primary and secondary contacts of cases in isolation. The Australasian College for Emergency Medicine Victoria faculty chair, Dr Mya Cubitt, said on Friday that doctors and nurses in public hospitals had been dreading such a situation because they were still recovering from Victoria‚Äôs second wave in 2020. At its height, there were more than 700 new cases in a single day. There were 768 deaths overall with hundreds of healthcare workers infected. ‚ÄúWe are in the worst crisis that healthcare has faced in many years,‚Äù Cubitt said. ‚ÄúYou could even say ‚Äì and I‚Äôd love to speak with [chief health officer Prof] Brett Sutton about this ‚Äì that the access block and overcrowding of the system is the bigger public health emergency at the moment. Whether we have a Covid outbreak or not, emergency clinicians, and all of the many colleagues that we intersect with in the healthcare system, are under extreme pressure.‚Äù Read more of Melissa Davey‚Äôs report here: Overcrowding in Victorian hospitals ‚Äòbigger emergency than Covid‚Äô, expert warns Sky News have just posted a clip of that Kwasi Kwarteng interview on Twitter. Reuters have been looking at the impact of Covid in the South Asia region, and have found that the tally of cases there, according to their figures, passed 30 million today. They report that the south Asia region - India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Bhutan, Nepal, Maldives and Sri Lanka ‚Äì accounts for 18% of global cases and almost 10% of deaths. But there is growing suspicion that official tallies of infections and deaths are not reflecting the true extent of the problem. India‚Äôs decision to halt the export of vaccines until at least October has had a knock-on effect, with other South Asia countries such as Nepal and Bangladesh making diplomatic efforts to secure Covid-19 vaccines to prop up their faltering inoculation drives as their stocks run out. India‚Äôs western neighbour Pakistan, with purchases and donations from China and allocations from the World Health Organisation and the GAVI Vaccine Alliance, has now secured more than 18m doses. Pakistan has opened its vaccination campaign to everyone aged 19 or older. As I mentioned, business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has been on Sky News, and he was rather downbeat when asked about the prospects for the roadmap out of lockdown. He said: We don‚Äôt want to proceed with the roadmap without considering all the information that we have. I think that the numbers of cases, is a matter of concern. Today‚Äôs the 28th of May. It‚Äôs impossible for anyone to know what the situation will be like in a week or two weeks time. On the positive side, he said ‚Äúthe other thing that‚Äôs very helpful and encouraging, is the fact that the numbers of hospitalizations, and the number of fatalities as well, is considerably lower than it was even just two months ago‚Äù Ultimately he keep reiterating that the UK government would be guided by data: There‚Äôs lots of facts that we have to consider. I, as business secretary, I‚Äôm very committed to try to reopen on 21 June, I can‚Äôt guarantee that. And as I‚Äôve said, we‚Äôre looking at the data, every day. The UK government dashboard shows that cases, deaths and hospitalisations are all going up, albeit at much lower levels than they were at the height of the pandemic. Kwarteng confirmed that there would be no decision before 14 June. Good morning from London, it is Martin Belam here ‚Äì you can get in touch with me at martin.belam@theguardian.com. The UK‚Äôs business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng looks to have drawn the short straw for media duties this morning ‚Äì he‚Äôll be on Sky News in a few moments. While we wait for that, here‚Äôs Lizzy Davies on calls for 6m more nurses worldwide: Health ministers around the world are being urged to sign off on plans to create 6m more nursing jobs by 2030, amid warnings that Covid-19 has exacerbated a global shortage and could spark a ‚Äúbrain drain‚Äù from the developing world. Delegates meeting virtually this week at the World Health Assembly, the key decision-making body of the World Health Organization, are expected to adopt a resolution calling on countries to transform the nursing profession through more investment, support and training. The WHO director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, called on countries to invest in healthcare workers, nearly 50% of whom are nurses and midwives, saying the pandemic had reminded everyone ‚Äúthat these are incredible people doing incredible jobs under incredible circumstances‚Äù. ‚ÄúWe owe them so much, and yet globally health and care workers often lack the protection, the equipment, the training, the decent pay, the safe working conditions and the respect they deserve,‚Äù he said in his opening remarks. ‚ÄúIf we have any hope of achieving a healthier, safer, fairer future, every member state must protect and invest in its health and care workforce as a matter of urgency.‚Äù Read more here: ‚ÄòProtect and invest‚Äô: WHO calls for 6m more nurses worldwide That‚Äôs it from me, Helen Sullivan, for today. And if, for a break from pandemic news, you‚Äôd like to see a praying mantis wearing ‚Äútiny homemade 3D glasses‚Äù, might I suggest: Russia has registered the world‚Äôs first vaccine for animals against Covid, its agricultural regulator said on Wednesday, after tests showed it generated antibodies against the virus in dogs, cats, foxes and mink, Reuters reports. Mass production of the vaccine, called Carnivac-Cov, can start in April, regulator Rosselkhoznadzor said. The World Health Organization has expressed concern over the transmission of the virus between humans and animals. The regulator said the vaccine would be able to protect vulnerable species and thwart viral mutations. Russia has so far only registered two cases of Covid among animals, both in cats. Denmark culled all 17 million mink on its farms last year after concluding that a strain of the virus had passed from humans to mink and that mutated strains of the virus had then turned up among people. Rosselkhoznadzor said Russian fur farms planned to buy the vaccine, along with businesses in Greece, Poland and Austria. Russia‚Äôs fur farm industry accounts for around 3% of the global market, down from 30% in the Soviet era, according to the main trade body. Thailand‚Äôs food and drug regulator on Friday approved for emergency use the coroanvirus vaccine developed by China‚Äôs Sinopharm, Reuters reports, citing a senior official. ‚ÄúThe FDA has approved the Sinopharm vaccine,‚Äù senior health official Paisan Dankhum told a news conference, making it the fifth Covid-19 vaccine Thailand has approved. Japanese shares jumped on Friday, as investors scooped up stocks after sell-offs due to MSCI‚Äôs reshuffle in the previous session, while progress in the country‚Äôs vaccination drive lifted risk appetite on prospects of a swift economic recovery, Reuters reports. The Nikkei share average crossed the 29,000 level for the first time since 11 May, jumping 1.95% to 29,106.86, as of 0205 GMT. The index is poised for a weekly gain of 2.8%. Rollouts of Covid vaccines have contributed to positive sentiment as investors hope a steady vaccination drive can help accelerate economic recovery, market participants said. Japan said on Friday it would consider sharing its Covid vaccines with other countries as a ruling party committee urged it to provide a portion of its AstraZeneca Plc vaccine stock to Taiwan, Reuters reports. Taiwan is battling a spike in domestic infections and has vaccinated only about 1% of its population, while Japan has secured more than 400 million doses, double what it needs for its adult population. ‚ÄúWe think it‚Äôs important to ensure fair access to safe and effective vaccines in every country and region towards achieving universal health coverage,‚Äù Japan‚Äôs Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato told a news conference. ‚ÄúWe will swiftly consider and look into a concrete course of policy with regard to how we provide other countries and regions with vaccines that exceed the amount for those needed at home. Masahisa Sato, the head of a Japanese ruling party committee on Taiwan relations, said earlier on Friday the government should provide Taiwan with vaccines as soon as possible, adding ‚Äúwhen Japan was in need Taiwan sent us 2 million masks.‚Äù Kato declined to comment whether Tokyo had received supply requests from specific countries. India reported on Friday 186,364 new coronavirus infections during the previous 24 hours, for its lowest daily rise since April 14, while deaths rose by 3,660. The South Asian nation‚Äôs tally of infections now stands at 27.56 million, with the death toll at 318,895, health ministry data show. Japan is expected to extend emergency coronavirus measures in Tokyo and several other regions by about three weeks, according to officials, as the country struggles to rein in a fourth wave of infections less than two months before the Olympics. The state of emergency ‚Äì the third in the capital since the start of the pandemic ‚Äì was called in late April and was originally due to end on 11 May, but was extended until the end of this month, as restrictions on businesses failed to make a dent in infections. Media reports said the latest extension could last until 20 June. Infections have fallen in Tokyo in recent days, but the daily caseload is still too high to justify an end to the measures, according to medical experts, while hospitals are contending with a record number of critically ill Covid-19 patients: Hello and welcome to today‚Äôs live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic with me, Helen Sullivan. As always, you can get in touch with me on Twitter @helenrsullivan. India reported on Friday 186,364 new coronavirus infections during the previous 24 hours, for its lowest daily rise since April 14, while deaths rose by 3,660. The South Asian nation‚Äôs tally of infections now stands at 27.56 million, with the death toll at 318,895, health ministry data show. Meanwhile Japan is expected to extend emergency coronavirus measures in Tokyo and several other regions by about three weeks, according to officials, as the country struggles to rein in a fourth wave of infections less than two months before the Olympics. Here are the key developments from the last few hours: Argentina reported a record one-day number of new Covid-19 cases of 41,080 on Thursday, amid a second wave of infections that has made the country one of the hardest hit in the world, pushing the local health care system to its limit. Africa needs at least 20m doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine within six weeks if those who have had their first shot are to get the second in time, the WHO said on Thursday. Up to three-quarters of new UK Covid cases are thought to be caused by the variant first detected in India, as the reported number more than doubled to almost 7,000, Matt Hancock said on Thursday. The United States called on Thursday for the World Health Organization to carry out a second phase of its investigation into the origins of the coronavirus, with independent experts given full access to original data and samples in China. The US intelligence community acknowledged its agencies had two theories on where Covid-19 originated, with an element embracing a possible laboratory accident as the source of the pandemic. US President Joe Biden said he is likely to release a report detailing the US intelligence community‚Äôs findings on the origins of Covid-19 in full. Sweden will go forward with its plan to ease some of its Covid curbs from June 1, prime minister Stefan Lofven said. Germany plans to make enough Covid vaccine doses available to offer a first shot to all children aged 12 and over by the end of August, a draft health ministry document showed.","charCount":"32053","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a> (now) and <a href=\"profile/helen-sullivan\">Helen Sullivan</a> (earlier)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/live/2021/may/28/champions-league-final-and-play-offs-news-weekend-football-countdown","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-28T09:47:19Z","webTitle":"Champions League final and play-offs news ‚Äì weekend football countdown!","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2021/may/28/champions-league-final-and-play-offs-news-weekend-football-countdown","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2021/may/28/champions-league-final-and-play-offs-news-weekend-football-countdown","fields":{"headline":"Champions League final and play-offs news ‚Äì weekend football countdown!","standfirst":"<ul><li>The latest news ahead of Saturday‚Äôs showpiece in Porto</li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/may/27/thomas-tuchel-chelsea-inside-the-mind-of-an-obsessive-with-the-winning-touch\">Tuchel: inside the mind of an obsessive with a winning touch</a></li><li>And you can <a href=\"mailto:john.brewin.casual@theguardian.com\">email John</a>, tweet <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JohnBrewin_\">@johnbrewin_</a> or post BTL</li></ul>","trailText":"The latest news ahead of Saturday‚Äôs showpiece in Porto and the crunch weekend at Wembley.

Plenty of time for that on Sunday. Saturday night in the Est√°dio do Drag√£o will all be about mentality, and Ben Welch‚Äôs piece for the Blizzard, carried in these pages, hears from psychologists and players who share their tips for staying self-assured. The rest of the Premier League will look on at City and Chelsea with gimlet eyes, but the transfer window is about to be prised open. Manchester United look like early market movers, though we probably say that every year. Noel Gallagher has been talking to the BBC about Manchester City and, well, himself. What Manchester City have done is exactly what the owners said would happen. When they came in and said they were determined to turn us into one of the biggest clubs in Europe and the world, all I was thinking was, I don‚Äôt care what you do, as long as that banner comes down at Old Trafford, the one showing how long we‚Äôd been without a trophy. I remember meeting [City chairman] Khaldoon Al Mubarak at the start and telling him that and he was adamant, saying ‚Äòoh no no no, it‚Äôs going to be much greater than that‚Äô. I was like ‚Äòwhatever‚Äô but my God they have been true to their word and it has just been an amazing journey that the club has been on. It feels like quite a neat anniversary - we‚Äôve had 10 years of the High Flying Birds and 10 years of City in the Champions League. Not only that but it‚Äôs my birthday on Saturday and I‚Äôm going to be in Porto, so it‚Äôs a big day all round. And here‚Äôs the brilliant Barney Ronay on Kevin De Bruyne, the main man for Manchester City. De Bruyne will turn 30 next month. He‚Äôs about to play his 494th professional game. To date he has three Premier League titles, an FA Cup and five League Cups, which is certainly a lot of League Cups. He has been player of the year in England, Germany and Belgium, but never above ninth spot in the Ballon d‚ÄôOr. This will be Manchester City‚Äôs second European final. Remembering Big Mal, Joe Mercer, the other Neil Young with those who were in Vienna in 1970, including City stalwart Tommy Booth. Jacob Steinberg dove deeply into Tactics Tom ahead of the final. Great piece. Saturday is also upon us, and it will be a tremendous day of red hot soccer. Brentford and Swansea, two teams who play the game the ‚Äòright‚Äô way will serve as an hors d‚Äôoeuvre for the evening‚Äôs events in Porto when they play in the EFL Championship play-off final. It will be a match when every kick can be measured by how much money it might cost, football divined right down to the pecuniary. Talking of which, can Manchester City reach the holy grail of winning the competition their owners set out to win on buying the club in 2008 or will Roman Abramovich celebrate success for the second time, having set out a similar target five years before. Setting aside such cynicism, both games promise so much with Thomas Tuchel seeming to have Pep Guardiola‚Äôs number so far this season and Swansea and Brentford drew both their games 1-1 in the regular season. Last year, of course, Brentford did a number on the Swans in the play-off semis only to lose to Scott Parker‚Äôs Fulham. Two different matches, two rather different forms of jeopardy.

Economic confidence across the eurozone has hit a three-year high, as optimism over the recovery from the pandemic rises. It was lifted by a jump in sentiment at service sector firms, retailers and among consumers, as Covid-19 restrictions are eased, new data from from the European Commission shows. The EC‚Äôs index of eurozone economic sentiment has jumped to 114.5 points in May from 110.5 in April, higher than expected, and close to its December 2017 peak. It also rose strongly in the wider EU, up 4 points to 113.9. These readings are ‚Äúmarkedly above its long-term average and pre-pandemic level‚Äù, says the EC, with employment expectations also rising. Optimism in the services sector rose the most, and broke above its long-term average for the first time since March last year - jumping from 2.2 to 11.3 in the euro area. The report explains: Managers expressed more positive views on the past business situation and past demand, and were more optimistic on demand expectations. Consumer confidence increased for the fourth time in a row (+3.0), driven by an improvement in all its components (i.e. views on their household‚Äôs past and future financial situation, their expectations of the general economic situation in their country, and their intentions to make major purchases). Industry confidence increased for the sixth month in a row, with managers reporting strong order books and improved export demand. Retail trade confidence rose for the third time in a row (+2.8), and construction confidence improved (+1.9), as managers reported improved order books and more optimistic employment expectations. Back on Joe Biden‚Äôs budget proposal...CNBC say the president is proposing $5tn in new federal spending over the next 10 years. President Joe Biden will propose $5 trillion in new federal spending over the next decade on Friday, part of his fiscal year 2022 budget request, a source familiar with the proposal tells CNBC. The new spending would be paid for in part by $3.6 trillion in additional revenues over the same period. The result would be a net deficit of $1.4 trillion, which would begin shrinking after 2030. Biden will include $300 billion of the $5 trillion total in his budget request to Congress for fiscal year 2022. This will bring the president‚Äôs total budget request for next year to $6 trillion, the source said. European stocks have hit a new all-time high, as optimism over the economic recovery continues to lift share prices across the region. The Europe-wide Stoxx 600 index has gained 0.45% this morning to 448.45 points, a fresh record. Every sector is higher, led by financials, industrial stocks and utilities. The Stoxx 600 has now gained over 12% so far this year, amid optimism that Europe‚Äôs economy will rebound strongly from the pandemic - now that Covid-19 vaccination programs have picked up speed. Germany‚Äôs DAX and France‚Äôs CAC are both up around 0.4%. Recent European economic data has shown activity is picking up strongly, with business growth hitting a three-year high this month and the EC upgrading its own growth forecasts. America‚Äôs strong recovery, and president Biden‚Äôs spending plans, are also providing a lift. Fr√©d√©rique Carrier, Head of Investment Strategy, RBC Wealth Management, says the European economy is reviving faster than most observers expected. Europe, where many countries had to extend lockdown measures, is finally emerging from a long economic winter thanks to lower infection rates and an accelerating vaccine rollout. Carrier has upgraded her view on European equities to ‚Äòoverweight‚Äô, predicting they will see a ‚Äòconducive climate‚Äô over the next six to 12 months. She writes: As macroeconomic momentum builds, earnings delivery is strong and both management and consensus forecasts are being revised upwards. The Q1 reporting season was exceptionally robust, with companies in the Euro STOXX Index, an index of some 300 European companies, easily beating consensus expectations and generating earnings per share growth of close to 40 percent year over year, driven by sales increases and margin expansion. Moreover, management teams overall were optimistic on a demand recovery, though some noted concerns regarding supply shortages. Most were confident of their pricing power and ability to reduce costs. Following a heady Q1, upgraded forecasts suggest the earnings recovery is likely to last into next year. The consensus is looking for earnings growth of around 15 percent year over year for 2022. In the City, the blue-chip FTSE 100 index has risen 30 points to 7050 points, up 0.45%. Top risers include energy firm SSE (+2.6%), and UK housebuilders Taylor Wimpey (+2.5%), Barratt Development (+2.4%) and Persimmon (+2.1%). Luxury fashion group Burberry (+2.5%), and financial stocks such as HSBC (+2.4%) and Prudential (+2.4%) are also higher this morning. Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor, says the prospect of higher inflation is pushing the market up. ‚ÄúFurther signs that the US economy is beginning to run hot prompted another switch into value stocks, at the expense of growth. The renewed consideration of cyclical stocks as an investment destination has generally played into the hands of the FTSE100, which has now risen by 9% in the year to date. The index is replete with sectors falling into the recovery category, such as the banks, oils and miners. For the likes of the airlines and the hospitality sectors, however, the outlook remains rather more cloudy as both travel restrictions and the emergence of Covid-19 variants hinder a smooth return to some sort of normality. The US stock market is expected to open higher later today. The Dow Jones industrial average up around 0.5% in pre-market trading, adding to yesterday‚Äôs 0.4% gain. Australia‚Äôs benchmark stock index, the S&amp;P/ASX 200, has hit a record closing high today, amid renewed optimism in the global economic outlook and the prospect of a $6tn Biden budget. The mining sector was leading the gains with financials, energy, industrials and consumer staples also higher. Higher US spending could mean greater demand for commodities and a wider boost to growth. This lifted the index to its highest close, and near the intraday high hit early in the pandemic. The Australian Financial Review reports: A sharp rally in domestic miners and energy stocks drove the S&amp;P/ASX 200 Index to a fresh closing high of 7179.5, rising 84.6 points, or 1.2 per cent, on Friday amid speculation that US President Joe Biden is planning an infrastructure friendly $6 trillion budget. Shares exceeded their May 10 record of 7172.8 points, but not the intraday high of 7197 set on February 20, 2020. Asian stocks have put global equities on course for a seventh day of gains today as investors bet the U.S. will lead the world out of the COVID-19 pandemic, points out Reuters. While Japan‚Äôs Nikkei led the way with a 2.1% jump, MSCI‚Äôs broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 0.3% earlier today. The MSCI world equity index added 0.1% to 709.71, nearing the all-time closing high of 710.36 set on May 7. However, China‚Äôs CSI 300 index dipped by 0.3%. Kyle Rodda of IG explains why president Biden‚Äôs budget plans have lifted spirits: Given its sensitivity to swings in the business cycle, commodity prices and global trade, Asia‚Äôs financial markets could arguably be said to benefit most from a big spending US fiscal package. As much seemed to manifest in the region‚Äôs stock markets today: Asia‚Äôs benchmark indices have generally put in solid rallies to end the month ‚Äì with the notable exception of Chinese stocks, which have traded flat ‚Äì as markets discount the possibility of another pump-priming of global growth by the US. The export sensitive Nikkei has been the noteworthy outperformer, despite Japan extending its state of emergency today. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Global stock markets are nudging higher as investors brace for president Joe Biden to propose a $6tn spending package when he unveils his first budget later today. Biden is expected to propose record federal spending of $6tn in the 2022 financial year, starting in October, rising to $8.2 trillion by 2031, according to a report in the New York Times. Citing documents it had obtained, the NYT said the Democratic president planned to pay for his agenda through increased taxes on corporations and high earners, with budget deficits expected to decrease in the 2030s. The budget will show how Biden intends to deliver on his sweeping domestic agenda. That includes the American Jobs Plan to build new transport, water, energy and broadband infrastructure, modernise homes, and boost manufacturing, and the American Families Plan to invest more in childcare and education. The budget will also outline how the White House see inflation, employment, and economic growth panning out. The budget deficit is expected to hit $1.8tn in 2022. But the documents will also be aspirational. Biden‚Äôs Democrats hold only narrow majorities in the House and Senate, and the Republicans are pushing for a smaller infrastructure package instead. So a pitched battle lies ahead. As Reuters explains: Republicans have criticized the president for seeking trillions in new spending, setting the stage for pitched battles over his priorities. ‚ÄúIt just seems like the trillions keep on coming,‚Äù Republican U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito, who is leading a group of colleagues pursuing a counteroffer to Biden‚Äôs current $1.7 trillion infrastructure proposal. Yesterday, president Biden told an event in Cleveland that it‚Äôs the right time to invest in the economic recovery: ‚ÄúNow is the time to build (upon) the foundation that we‚Äôve laid to make bold investments in our families and our communities and our nation. We know from history that these kinds of investments raise both the floor and the ceiling over the economy for everybody.‚Äù Hailing the recent progress against Covid-19, Biden added: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve turned the tide on the once-in-a-century pandemic. ‚ÄúAnd now we‚Äôre faced with a question: what kind of economy are we going to build for tomorrow? What are we going to do? I believe this is our moment to rebuild an economy from the bottom up and the middle out.‚Äù Asia-Pacific equity markets have been boosted overnight, with Japan‚Äôs Nikkei jumping 2.1% and South Korea‚Äôs Kospi gaining 0.8%. Investors anticipate that this surge in US spending will feed through to the global economy, as Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at OANDA, explains: President Biden‚Äôs Preliminary Budget is envisaging a $1.8 trillion deficit next year, after tax rises. Of course, what the President would like, and what he will get from Congress could be quite different, but with that level of spending, Asia appears to feel that some of that goody bag will fall their way, and Asian equity markets have risen today Strong economic data yesterday is also supporting stocks, with the number of new US jobless claims falling to a pandemic low yesterday, and US growth confirmed at a pacy 1.6% in the last quarter (while the UK and eurozone contracted). Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote, says: A robust GDP growth in the first quarter, a fresh pandemic low print in weekly jobless claims and the talk of a $6 trillion federal spending package for the coming fiscal year boosted appetite in most equities and the US dollar. But could inflation fears spoil the party again? Later today we get the latest ‚Äòcore PCE price‚Äô index -- the US Federal Reserve‚Äôs preferred gauge of inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices.

Facilities hurriedly prepared residents for rushed vaccines on Friday as the commonwealth raced to vaccinate neglected populations within the highest priority group it had initially promised to two months ago. The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, had said on Thursday there were 74 residential aged care homes across Australia that had not yet received an initial dose of Covid vaccine including 16 in Victoria. But he went on a media blitz on Friday morning insisting every aged care home in the state would have received at least one dose by the weekend. The government‚Äôs push to vaccinate the remaining aged care homes in Victoria came a day after Hunt announced the recommended two-week interval between flu and Covid shots would be scrapped for aged care settings in Victoria. The operator of one aged care home in Melbourne, who asked not to be identified, told Guardian Australia they were surprised to learn vaccination teams were being sent to their facility on Friday. It presented logistical hurdles to prepare residents at such short notice, they said. The home had initially been scheduled to receive its first doses last week, but a sick staff member on the mobile medical team contracted by the commonwealth to vaccinate the facility forced the vaccination date to be postponed to early June. ‚ÄúYou wonder why it took so long in the first place to vaccinate us here, I mean we‚Äôre in Melbourne after all,‚Äù the operator said. ‚ÄúIt annoys me a bit because the government is clearly being misleading when it claims its aged care vaccinations are doing well. It‚Äôs the end of May already.‚Äù The operator said the medical team that arrived at their facility on Friday appeared to have been contracted at short notice and would unlikely be able to vaccinate all residents in one day. The situation mirrored vaccination issues experienced by another Melbourne aged care home, Jewish Care Windsor. After Guardian Australia reported their initial vaccinations were cancelled due to a sick staff member from Health Care Australia ‚Äì contracted by the federal government to vaccinate aged care homes ‚Äì the matter was raised in question time on Thursday. Jewish Care said the federal government called the facility shortly after question time, instructing them to prepare to receive a vaccination team on Friday. ‚ÄúThe late notice creates some operational challenges,‚Äù a spokesperson said. The same situation was reported at the Doutta Galla aged care home in Footscray in Melbourne, which also had its first doses fast-tracked to Friday after the government scrapped the flu shot interval recommendation. On Friday, authorities announced Melbourne‚Äôs cluster had grown by four cases to a total of 30. As part of restrictions under the current lockdown, no visitors are allowed at aged care facilities except for end-of-life cases. Medical professionals familiar with the federal government‚Äôs vaccination of aged care homes said shots had to be ‚Äúcarefully planned‚Äù and schedule changes, whether due to sick staff or fast-tracked vaccination dates, would impact the queue for second doses. They said fast-tracking aged care dates also impacted the vaccine schedule for other facilities requiring mobile teams and cold chain delivery of Pfizer vaccines for other settings ‚Äì including disability care. On Friday, Hunt revealed 20,000 of the 26,000 Australians living in disability care had not yet received their first dose. Some 9,000 doses had been administered to 6,000 disability care residents, he told ABC radio. Hunt told reporters in Canberra in the last week the number of in-reach visits to vaccinate residents of disability care centres had doubled to 424.

For the business, a catering company delivers large, refilled packs directly to the kitchen, but on the domestic front Rawson and his partner are regulars at the Ecover refill station at Kirkgate Market in Leeds. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about a change of habit more than anything,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI suppose it was a bit of a hassle at the outset, but any sort of eco-living seems more difficult to start with.‚Äù Now a total convert, he‚Äôs always on the lookout for anything at the market he can buy without packaging. Back in Bedfordshire, McMurdo is spreading the word about Ecover refills to his fellow boat owners. ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre all getting back to nature a bit more,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAnd when you‚Äôre living more in touch with nature, you have to consider it more; so the products you‚Äôre using have to be even better selected.‚Äù You can find your nearest Ecover refill station, as well as learning more about the full Ecover range, at ecover.com/store-locator. If your local store isn‚Äôt listed then why not encourage the owner to get in touch with Ecover and bring the ‚Äúrefillution‚Äù to your doorstep.","charCount":"6142","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"Mark Hillsdon"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"politics/2021/may/28/kwasi-kwarteng-defends-hancock-over-covid-care-home-claims","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-28T09:24:33Z","webTitle":"Kwasi Kwarteng defends Hancock over Covid care home claims","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/may/28/kwasi-kwarteng-defends-hancock-over-covid-care-home-claims","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2021/may/28/kwasi-kwarteng-defends-hancock-over-covid-care-home-claims","fields":{"headline":"Kwasi Kwarteng defends Hancock over Covid care home claims","standfirst":"<p>Business secretary says residents ‚Äòwere protected as far as we could‚Äô during early days of pandemic</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus ‚Äì latest updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul>","trailText":"Business secretary says residents ‚Äòwere protected as far as we could‚Äô during early days of pandemic","byline":"Haroon Siddique","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"95456005aed781f141e5a108e4cd57980863a469\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95456005aed781f141e5a108e4cd57980863a469/0_0_3198_1919/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kwasi Kwarteng\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kwasi Kwarteng: Hancock ‚Äòalways maintained he wanted to build up testing capacity.

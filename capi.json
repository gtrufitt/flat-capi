It’s been said to him several times from <strong>Jane Halton</strong>, from the opposition, from everyone concerned yet it hasn’t been done.</p> <p><strong> SR:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The states and territories are still keen to continue to operate it. Now, at the same time …</p> </blockquote> <p> KG: [interrupts] Override them.</p> <p><strong> SR:<br></strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> … over the same time – well, you’ve seen the constitutional powers and the limit of them with trying to keep state borders open and our inability to do that because the states are supreme in their own states.</p> </blockquote> <p>KG: But they’re now saying they want you to build one in northern Victoria, one in Toowoomba. Why is the government not jumping all over this?</p> <p><strong>SR: </strong><br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>So, we’ve expanded Howard Springs to 2,000. We’re going through with Victoria now in a very good proposal from Victoria, as the prime minister has said. And the issue in Toowoomba, of course, is we don’t have the details from the Queensland state government. Now, if they gave us all of the detail in the same vein that Victoria has, it may be a different discussion. But we’re working very constructively with Victoria on their proposal.</p> </blockquote> <p>KG: Do you see why some, including the opposition, are saying that the government’s been sitting on its hands on this issue? It’s not like this proposal of getting the quarantine out of hotels hasn’t been around for some months now.</p> <p><strong>SR:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> Again, we are working with the states and territories, and they were the ones that wanted to run quarantine. Now, states are now coming forward with alternative proposals, and the Victorian one’s a great case in point. We’re working really constructively with them.</p> </blockquote> <p>KG:</p> <p>So does the PM say at the election campaign to people if there’s a massive outbreak, look, it was the states’ fault? Is that where we get to?</p> <p><strong>SR:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> Well, national cabinet was all about being in this together and doing this together. The decision was made together that states and territories would run quarantine. Now the opposition is saying that it’s not good enough the states and territories are running quarantine. And they’re criticising their state and territory colleagues, which I think is a bit harsh. States and territories are doing their best and they’re having a good crack at this.</p> </blockquote> <p> KG:<br></p> <p> I think they’re criticising you, to be fair. They’re criticising your government.</p> <p><strong>SR</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> <strong>Well, they’re saying we should take it over because they’re saying the states are failing. And I don’t think the states are failing. I think our relationship with the states on this is actually going quite well, and we’ll continue to work …</strong></p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-05-27T01:02:44.908Z\">at 2.02am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-60aeeb438f086d71cc15bdc1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-05-27T00:44:33.641Z\">1.44am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>WA has also called a Covid presser – 9.15am WA time, which is 11.15am eastern time – so it looks as though that state will also be banning Melbourne residents.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-05-27T00:52:23.356Z\">at 1.52am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-60aeea758f088d8c3178a4a8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/christopher-knaus\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-05-27T00:41:47.987Z\">1.41am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Things got slightly heated over in the legal and constitutional affairs estimates a bit earlier, where Labor senator <strong>Kim Carr</strong> has been questioning officials from the administrative appeals tribunal about the appointment of former Liberal members. </p> <p>Liberal senator <strong>David Van</strong> asked the AAT to calculate how much time and expense has been incurred answering Carr’s questions, prompting senator <strong>Rex Patrick</strong> to accuse him and the Morrison government of being “allergic to oversight”. </p> <p><strong>Van asked Patrick to “step outside” and say the same thing, prompting Patrick to invite Van to look at his tweets, which frequently express similar criticisms</strong>.

The speed up in vaccinations has happened where the states have taken it into their own hands. There is no plan as yet for a national approach to expanding the vaccination program to beyond those over 50s There is no campaign to counter vaccine hesitancy. Will the federal government finally do a vaccination campaign, given the hesitancy? Scott Morrison uses this question for a wide ranging fatherhood statement that doesn’t actually answer the question: I am pleased the numbers each week have been growing and growing, not that long ago we talked about week we vaccinations of 350,000, now it is well over 500000 and that will build on weeks and months ahead, especially when they are supported by additional supplies coming through from Pfizer, the next big jump we will be able to see them sing those vaccination rates elevate in weeks and months ahead as we move towards the end of this year. There is no doubt, as I move around the country, while it is wonderful and enviable around the world, that Australians can live like we are living here in this country, notwithstanding the very significant difficulties Victorians will face over the next seven days, that, that way of living, can of course lead to some hesitancy when it comes to coming forward on those vaccines, these events I think will set out very clearly that this is an insidious virus, it hasn’t gone anywhere, it’s not giving up, it continues to attack where ever it can and where ever it well and it continues to be as dangerous and I would argue even more dangerous today than it was a year ago because what we are seeing now, is as the virus has ravaged the developed world, it is now ravaging the developing world. With that and the multitude of cases we can continue to expect to see in places as we already see in India, and we took some very strong decisions on India to protect Australians, we will continue to see this occurring in the developing world. This week I spoke to the Prime Minister of Vietnam, we had the three conversation and supporting them with additional vaccine over the second half of this year, I spoke to the Prime Minister of the Solomons yesterday in the support we are giving to them on vaccines as well as the Prime Minister of PNG. This virus will continue to see different screens emergency we will continue to combat this. It is another does make it does not matter whether it is Victoria, Western Australia or Far North Queensland. The vaccines are there. Make a booking, talk to your doctor, please get vaccinated. You very much, everyone. National cabinet is not scheduled to meet until Friday week. It is no longer on “war footing” (it was never on war footing – Scott Morrison called it that, but really all it was was a couple of extra meetings). Morrison says that is because it got “so much done” in that first week. It’s amazing what a few lost state elections have done, and the subsequent election reports which found state border closures were popular: suddenly, the prime minister is very strong on the federation, and how the states will make their own decisions. Scott Morrison: At the end of the day this is a federation, states have their authorities and powers and they will make as they see them in the best interest of the state and territory. Scott Morrison now says he thinks the purpose-built quarantine centre Victoria has proposed could be sped up: We are working closely with the Victorian government to address the challenges Victorians are facing right now, and in private conversations I had with the acting premier I know was his intention with working with me, and the excellent relationship between the health minister in Victoria and Greg Hunt here federally, I want to assure Victorians the Victorian and federal government are working hand in glove to get this job done. The only thing that matters is their health, safety, jobs and protecting them and getting them through these next few days ahead. We are working with the Victorian government, they put forward a few weeks ago a very useful proposal, I discussed this yesterday with James Merlino. Know we are highly favourable towards this, we think this can be done quicker, that is one of the things we are working through with them now. One of the useful elements of this proposal is that it adds to capacity, it is not in place of hotel quarantine, they propose this to be in addition. I want to commend the Victorian government for keeping the repatriation flights going on, not reducing caps, to make sure the flights can also keep coming as we seek to bring Australians home even in the middle of challenges they face in the next seven days. I would describe it as a highly cooperative arrangement focusing on mild problems ahead and working together to address them. Does the government need to ‘turbo charge’ the program? And was it too early to take national cabinet off ‘war footing’ (spoiler - there was never any ‘war footing’. There were just more meetings) Scott Morrison: We put the measures in place which brought all of those things forward, which restates to do and we were keen to support them to do as well, so bringing forward the over 50s, which we have done, bringing forward the greater state based vaccination clinics, which was particularly done in Victoria, I was in Victoria last week, they were opening a further one of those, and I commended the Victorian State Government for doing that as with other state governments moving to do this. The challenges that the Health Minister and Victoria and the acting premiere noted about the program today, related to the supply issues out of Europe, and the advisory groups regarding the AstraZeneca vaccine. They are the reasons that were identified by the Victorian government, and they are right to identify those. So, there are cases in Victoria and in paths right around the country for - for people to go and get their vaccination and we encourage them to do just that. It’s hard to... reconcile that with the international experience. When you look at countries around the world, which had far worse COVID experiences, and of course, entered into the vaccination program in emergency measures, well before Australia, whether it is in France, Canada, particularly now in Singapore, it’s hard to marry that with international experience, but what is important is exactly what the doctor was just saying, and I have said in Health Minister have said that this is a further reminder to Australians about the importance of getting vaccinated. I am pleased that we are now over 100,000 who were vaccinated yesterday, and we want to see that continue. I am pleased that particularly in Victoria, more than half of those aged over 70 have been vaccinated, but also right around the country, as I indicated, we expect about 4 million by the end of the week but it is still a long way to go. There are many things that need to operate is doubly one of the wings of containment are in effect right now with the work being done by contact races. What we have also learnt to the course of COVID is there is no simple one measure that provides any guarantee of certainty here, it requires all of these measures working together, but more importantly it requires governments to work together, patiently and cooperatively, and for Australians to work together to ensure we overcome this latest challenge, because in the COVID wells, the challenges will come, and we have boys been very upfront about that. No system is foolproof, so when challenges come like this from time to time, you address them, you address them together, calmly, patiently, understanding of the difficulties that this clearly will impose on Victorians over the course of the next seven days, and seek to minimise the disruption and that dislocation as much as possible. Greg Hunt has announced $2.6m to support the mental health of frontline health workers. “We just need to focus on working the issue, and working together – that’s how we have come through on every occasion,” Scott Morrison says. The federal government is very worried that Australia could be seeing what has happened in Taiwan and Vietnam and other countries which did well on suppression but have seen a resurgence of cases following a slowed vaccine rollout. Greg Hunt steps in to call the lockdown regrettable but necessary: Today is a difficult day for all Victorians, and we recognise that these are highly regrettable but necessary restrictions under the current circumstances. We have been through this before, we will get through this again. Scott Morrison “commends” the Victorian government and the state’s contact-tracing team for the job they have done: I want to command the Victorian government and the acting premier for their efforts over recent days, in particular, and I want to thank the contact tracers in Victoria for the very difficult job that they are engaged in. With so many different points of contact that we have here, being able to work through that information on the many thousands of contacts that they are working through, I think they are doing a tremendous job. And I commend them for the job they are doing, remembering that there are many rings of containment to ... deal with the virus and protect Australians from the virus. The work that is done enforcing those public health orders in the state through the quarantine system ... and then there is of course the contact tracing regime that has been so effectively used, not just now in Victoria but in other states that have confronted these exact same challenges. And Australians have been to come through this, and once again we will come through. No matter what our success has been, today that is no guarantee, or certainly, against a very challenging virus that continues to test not only here in Australia but all around the world. The prime minister says the expert health committee is meeting to discuss what is happening in Victoria. Scott Morrison begins: Once again we are faced with the challenge in the ongoing battle against Covid-19, the challenge and battle that we have faced many many times. And on each occasion, together we have overcome. There are no certainties, no guarantees, in a global pandemic and against a virus, an insidious virus such as this. Our defence has always been a steadfast resilience of the Australian people, working together, putting in place the best possible set of protections and systems that has seen Australia been able to come through and protect lives and livelihoods like few other countries in the world. But that, of itself, provides no guarantee ... The virus will continue to seek to strike anywhere around the country, as it has on this occasion. The next seven days in Victoria will be very challenging. Of course we are very mindful of the distressed and the difficulty this will impose upon people right across Victoria as a result of what has been described, rightly, by the acting premier as a circuit-breaking lockdown. New South Wales has now also released new health advice for Victorian travellers: Anyone travelling to NSW who has been in Victoria after 4pm today (Thursday) must follow the stay-at-home measures that will apply in Victoria, which were announced by the Victorian government this morning. This means anyone arriving in NSW who has been in Victoria since 4pm today must remain at their home or place of residence in NSW for the seven-day duration of the Victorian measures. People will only be permitted to leave their places of residence for limited reasons, including shopping for essential items, medical care, caregiving, outdoor exercise and essential work or education, if you cannot do it from home. People subject to the stay-at-home measures in Victoria should not be travelling to NSW unless they are permitted to do so. NSW residents in border communities will have different requirements, recognising the daily interaction of residents in these communities with regional Victoria. For NSW residents living along the Victorian border, the seven-day stay-at-home requirement will only apply to people who have been outside the border region in Victoria since 4pm today. The border communities are defined by the map which was used for the previous “bubble” arrangements. Anyone arriving in NSW by air, rail or road from Victoria (except those travelling within the defined border region) must complete a travel declaration that confirms they have not attended any of the growing number of venues of concern. Anyone who has attended a venue of concern must not travel to NSW; instead, they should follow the health advice on the Victorian Health website. The declaration form is available on the Service NSW website, and can be completed in the 24-hour period before entering NSW or on arrival. The information gathered via the travel declarations is vital in allowing NSW Health to contact travellers if necessary. NSW Health continues to urge people have been in Victoria since 12 May to check the Victoria Department of Health and Human Services website regularly to see if they have visited any of these venues of concern, and if so, immediately follow the relevant public health advice. If you attended any of the venues identified at the times listed, please contact NSW Health immediately on 1800 943 553. NSW strongly advises against all non-essential travel to Victoria at this time. People who do choose to travel will be required to follow the Victorian stay-at-home requirements on their return to NSW. Anthony Albanese has responded to the lockdown: Anthony Albanese and Mark Butler were meant to hold a press conference of their own at 1.30 in the opposition leader’s courtyard, but that might be put off because of the prime minister’s press conference Greg Hunt will join Scott Morrison, along with Dr Omar Khorshid, the president of the Australian Medical Association. Greg Hunt has cancelled his press conference - because the prime minister is now holding one. Scott Morrison will be up at 1.10 - in the courtyard. So South Australia, the Northern Territory, Western Australia, Queensland and now Tasmania have now closed their borders to Victoria, or to parts of Victoria. Here is Queensland’s announcement: From 1am AEST Wednesday 26 May, anyone arriving into Queensland who has been in the City of Whittlesea local government area on or since May 11 will go into hotel quarantine unless they have a valid exemption. Restrictions also apply to anyone entering Queensland who has been to any of the exposure venues in Victoria. From 1am Thursday 27 May, everyone arriving from Victoria is required to complete a border pass. Anyone of those arrivals who have been in the City of Whittlesea local government area on or since 11 May and are a non-resident will be turned away unless they have an exemption to enter the state. Queensland residents or those given an exemption to enter the state will go into hotel quarantine. Apply for a border pass. Restrictions may also apply if you are already in Queensland but visited the Melbourne region of Victoria on or after 18 May 2021. Adam Morton has reported on this significant court case in Australia: The federal court of Australia has found the environment minister, Sussan Ley, has a duty of care to protect young people from the climate crisis in a judgment hailed by lawyers and teenagers who brought the case as a world first. Eight teenagers and an octogenarian nun had sought an injunction to prevent Ley approving a proposal by Whitehaven Coal to expand the Vickery coalmine in northern New South Wales, arguing the minister had a common law duty of care to protect younger people against future harm from climate change. Justice Mordecai Bromberg found the minister had a duty of care to not act in a way that would cause future harm to younger people. But he did not grant the injunction as he was not satisfied the minister would breach her duty of care. The corporate regulator has launched legal action for unconscionable conduct against big financial services group AMP for charging fees to dead people. AMP’s habit of harvesting cash from graveyard clients was exposed at the banking royal commission in 2018 - all up, it charged fees to around 10,000 people who were no longer around to argue with the bill. However, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission is only pursuing AMP over about 2000 dead clients, because the rest of the alleged misbehaviour occurred before a six-year cutoff period for launching civil litigation. Asic alleges AMP reaped more than $500,000 in insurance premiums from the dead customers, plus $100,000 in advice fees. In a statement, AMP said it had changed its systems and paid $5.3m in compensation related to the 10,000 accounts held by dead people. Group general counsel David Cullen said: AMP has taken this matter very seriously and we will now carefully consider the allegations raised by Asic. We have been assisting ASIC with its investigation and will continue to engage constructively as part of the legal process. In other news: YouTube has contacted Guardian Australia to say it is now “actively” removing comments from Sky News Australia’s YouTube channel that violate its community guidelines. We reported that Sky News Australia’s YouTube channel published more than 9,000 comments mostly celebrating and mocking the shooting of a Black Lives Matter activist in Britain who is fighting for her life. A spokeswoman for YouTube said on Thursday: We are removing comments that are violative of our policies and will continue to do so as we keep monitoring the comments on the video. The move comes three days after the social media platform was advised of the thousands of hateful comments aimed at the black community that were posted. The racist and violent comments, which could be described as hate speech, appear below a short video news report uploaded on Monday about the activist Sasha Johnson. Johnson remains in a critical condition after sustaining a gunshot wound to her head in an incident in south London. On Wednesday YouTube said: We take the safety of our users very seriously and have strict policies that prohibit hate and harassment on YouTube, including content promoting violence or hatred against individuals or groups. Our community guidelines apply to videos and comments alike. Any flagged content found to violate our policies is removed from YouTube immediately. Tasmania is also putting restrictions on people entering the state from Victoria. Arrive after 2pm today and you are going into quarantine. Here is the announcement: Victoria has been declared a high-risk area from 2pm Thursday 27 May by Tasmanian public health authorities. The declaration was made in response to Victoria announcing a state-wide lockdown and additional cases of Covid-19 being detected in the community. Anyone intending to travel to Tasmania after 2pm Thursday May 27 who has been in Victoria in the 14 days prior to their travel will not be able to enter Tasmania unless approved as an essential traveller. Quarantine and other requirements are in place for essential travellers Tasmanian residents, who have a suitable residence to undertake 14 days quarantine, can apply to enter Tasmania as an essential traveller. If you don’t have a suitable residence, you will be required to quarantine in government-designated quarantine – fees may apply. Anyone who arrives before the declaration takes effect will be allowed to enter Tasmania – unless they have been in the Whittlesea local government area in the last 14 days or any of the identified high-risk premises. Anyone currently in Tasmania who has been in Victoria in the last 14 days is asked to monitor themselves for symptoms and book a test if they develop any cold or flu symptoms – even if only mild. Call the public health hotline to arrange a test. The situation is evolving, please check the travel alert page regularly for an updated list of high-risk premises. If you have been at any of the premises at the dates and times identified, please call the public health hotline on 1800 671 738. The Victorian Liberal moderate Russell Broadbent has used a contribution in parliament’s federation chamber to do two significant things. He has called on the government to accept the Uluru Statement from the Heart. Broadbent has told the chamber Australians need to acknowledge our historical role in the suffering of Indigenous people as the first step to healing. Broadbent noted Indigenous Australians had “extended the hand of reconciliation when they gave us the generous Uluru Statement from the Heart”. He added: As a nation, we should show grace and embrace it. Broadbent said including the voices of first nations people in national policy-making “should be non-negotiable to the government”. This was essential for healing, he said, so what were we afraid of? Continuing with his decency theme, but turning his focus to asylum seekers, Broadbent said it was time to face hard truths as well. He said it was time for Australians to “look at where the rubbish is”. People in Australia on bridging visas needed opportunity, and that meant opportunities for economic participation. Why can’t we be sensible and let them work? He said there was “nothing to fear from people being employed while on a bridging visa”, considering the whole country was “desperate for employees” given the international border remains closed. There was a lot in that press conference, so let’s recap From midnight, Victoria will go back into lockdown - for the fourth time. You can leave your house only for five reasons: caregiving, essential shopping, exercise, essential work and to get vaccinated If you are a single household, you can invite one person into your bubble. All non-essential stores are to close. Take-away is still OK. Masks must be worn everywhere. Major sporting events will continue, without crowds. There are now 10,000 people who have been identified as a primary or secondary contact of a confirmed case. Twenty-six people have been diagnosed with this cluster. More than 150 sites (including private homes) have been identified as exposure sites. One person is in the ICU. The Victorian press conference has ended. The comments under this are ... something. International flights are continuing - including repatriation flights from India. Martin Foley says it is unlikely the lockdown will be extended beyond the seven days. Brett Sutton says he doesn’t regret not putting the state into lockdown earlier, because the data had to be analysed. He says: We have to act on the information before us at any time. We had to analyse everything that we knew yesterday. [And there are] detailed discussions with cabinet. There is a detailed process of writing up dozens and dozens of pages of public health directions today, that will be charter compliance that will make considerations about all of the things that you are weighing up in terms of the constraints that are very serious. So we had to go through that process. I am confident that Victorians know what to do. They will not wait until midnight. I would also encourage them, if they have got plans that they can put off now, that before this afternoon, this evening ... cancel them, because we really need to start these measures as soon as possible. They become mandated from midnight, but Victorians know the right thing to do – we have done it before and we have done it better than anyone. Why is the vaccine program extended to 40-49-year-olds happening now? Why not earlier? Martin Foley says it is because authorities needed to make sure they had enough supply for the second dose in two weeks’ time. There are about 150 exposure sites, but you won’t find them all on the Victoria Health website – there are quite a few private residences among them. The exposure sites on the health website are the public ones. You’ll find the whole statement on the lockdown here: Why is it all of Victoria? James Merlino: We’ve got a bigger spread of exposure sites, more than 150 exposure sites across the state ... so we’ve got to make sure. And there is also the risk of people in metropolitan Melbourne moving into regional Victoria and spreading transmission of the virus. There is very strong advice from public health that this needs to be a statewide lockdown, a circuit breaker, and we will make an assessment, public health leading an assessment every day in terms of how we are tracking. It is seven days. If it can be earlier, it will be, but it is a seven-day circuit-breaker lockdown for the entirety of the state. In terms of people who live on the border, and work interstate, the people living in Victoria but work in New South Wales, for example, one other changes we’ve made – and this is subject to New South Wales and South Australia – but if [they] have close to the border and you work interstate in New South Wales and South Australia, whatever that occupation is, that person can continue to go to their place of work. And that is another difference to what we’ve had in the previous circuit-breaker lockdown. James Merlino says he understands how tough this will be on Victorians: This impacts on families, our schools, businesses. No-one wants to be in this position but I think the community also understands that we’ve got to follow public health advice. We’ve seen overseas what happens if this thing gets away. We must follow public health advice. My view is that as tough as this is for everyone, I think people appreciate that we just got to do this and Victorians have shown what a brilliant job they do and while I’m here, as education minister, one sector of our community, it will be parents and carers of our children and young people, students at school, our workforce. We will have remote learning for a few days next week. I do my department as a pupil free day tomorrow and a government school system so that our teachers and staff can focus and prepare for a few days of remote learning next week. My message to parents and carers is to trust your school and your child’s teacher They know what they are doing. They did a brilliant job last year and earlier this year they will do a brilliant job again. In terms of Catholic education and independent schools, a recommendation is they have a pupil free day to allow staff to prepare for remote learning for a few days but that will be a decision they will make. In terms of support, particularly for those kids that struggled with remote learning, this year we’ve got more than 5600 tutors as well as our existing teaching staff and other education support staff so we got 5600 tutors particularly focused on supporting those kids that really struggled. James Merlino is asked again if Victoria has enough vaccine supply. (The vaccine booking line is currently down in the state – it crashed with the news 40-49-year-olds are now eligible to book in). As the health minister and myself and others have said over the last few days, in terms of supply, we’ve got what we need now. For the duration of the year, and beyond, how confident we are will depend on the supply that is coming from the commonwealth. But in terms of right now, we have the supply that we need and I acknowledge and thank the commonwealth for the additional supplies that have been announced. That must be prioritised to disability workers, residents and aged care and other settings. We must make sure that our most vulnerable citizens are vaccinated as quickly as possible and that is responsibility of the commonwealth. Passengers who have been to Melbourne and are on the Ghan are being offloaded. This was expected: And anyone who has arrived in WA from Victoria between 16 May and 6pm 25 May must now present for a Covid-19 test within the next 48 hours, and remain in self-quarantine until they receive a negative result. The Australian Retail Association has also responded to the lockdown: The Australian Retailers Association (ARA) said the Victorian lockdown is a devastating blow for retailers, and consumer and business confidence and again highlights the threat of Covid is far from over. ARA CEO Paul Zahra said the seven-day lockdown is set to cost over a billion dollars in terms of lost retail trade. “We support the Victorian Government in their response to keep the community safe, but we can’t ignore the significant impact this lockdown will have on retailers, the Melbourne CBD and small businesses in particular,” Mr Zahra said. “Victorians have been to hell and back over the past year or so, and just when we thought the worst of Covid was behind us, it’s reared its head again mid-year. “Businesses no longer have JobKeeper support payments available to them and Victorian small businesses in particular will be under significant stress – this is a huge blow to their confidence. “A seven-day lockdown is expected to cost retailers over a billion dollars in terms of lost trade. This isn’t just a financial cost – it’s a social one as well. This lockdown will have an enormous impact on people’s health and wellbeing and will shatter fragile confidence levels for the second half of the year. This will also set back the valiant efforts of State and local government to restore confidence and foot traffic within Melbourne’s hard-hit CBD. “Online, click and collect and home delivery is still available in Victoria and we encourage people to use those options for getting the goods and services they need. “Most retailers have an online sales platform, so if there’s items you would normally buy in store - check out the online purchase, collection and delivery options they might have.” The ARA has called for focused efforts to bolster vaccinations and improve contact tracing within Victoria, along with targeted support to continue for small business and Melbourne’s CBD in light of this major set-back. How long until Victorians can see the impacts of the lockdown? Brett Sutton: Some of it will be immediate in the sense that people who are close contacts now will not have 100 close contact themselves. They will have three, four, five and that does make a difference. The real effects are still a few days away and it is fair to say that of the 24 cases we have got so far, all of that transmission occurred before we knew about the first case, essentially, so this is the time for the lockdown. Brett Sutton says Victoria could probably provide 30,000 vaccines a day “easily” and the primary care system – GPs – could do even more. He says if Victoria could get to 100,000 a day “that would be great”. Was consideration given for people who are fully vaccinated not to go into lockdown? Brett Sutton: There is no question that getting vaccinated and been two weeks after your first vaccine gives you a level of protection. One vaccine is not enough, but even for those who are poorly vaccinated and 12-14 days post at the second vaccine, it is problematic until we have clear directive from a national standard. The lockdown starts at 11.59pm tonight. Where you are tonight should be where you are for the full week of lockdown. But don’t go rushing to a new residence if you don’t have to. James Merlino says Daniel Andrews supports the lockdown: I spoke to the premier this morning and yesterday as well – his recovery is going well. This was a nasty incident -– fractured ribs, fractured vertebrae, very lucky. A very nasty injury and a long recovery. Anyone who has had a major back injury knows the duration, the pain of that recovery, but he is going well. He is walking. He put out a statement a little while ago that he hopes to be back in June. That will be subject to his doctor’s advice, but he is going well. But why is Victoria going into its fourth lockdown? James Merlino: Across the country, we have had breaches out of hotel quarantine across the country. We have had community transmission across the world. This is a global pandemic where millions and millions of people have died. We are not unique. Where we are unique is the work we did last year, all Victorians, in defeating the second wave. We need to deal with the reality of this outbreak that originated as of a hotel breach in SA. We need to deal with a reality that a vast majority of our community in this country are not vaccinated, and that means that we need to have these circuit-breaker lockdowns. Asked why no other state has gone through this like Victoria has, James Merlino says: We are continually improving how we respond to the pandemic and I go back to the work that our contact tracers have been doing with this particular outbreak that originated from a hotel quarantine breach in SA. As Professor Sutton and other experts have spoken about, there are others who are positive but do not shed and transmit. There are other individuals who are highly infectious. If you combine a highly infectious individual with high-risk transmission settings – bars, clubs and workplace – particular workplaces we are focused on at the moment, 10% of the workforce has returned a positive result, so when you have highly infectious people operating in a higher-risk settings, we do have transmission Should Victorians be angry at the federal government? James Merlino: It helps no one if I am just standing here blaming circumstances or blaming individuals or governments … It is a fact that the commonwealth vaccine rollout has been delayed and there are global reasons for that delay. You have to supply, procure and deliver and we have seen a delay. We have also seen a reluctance from some people to get vaccinated when they are eligible, so it is a fact that we have aged care facilities where not one person has been vaccinated. These are facts. We need to get this vaccination rolled out as quickly as possible, and that is why we have been doing a lot of work about how we can quickly expand what we offer at our state sites and that is why I am pleased that we have been in a position through Martin and his department that we can deliver the Pfizer vaccine for 40- to 49-year-olds. Despite the booking problems, Victoria’s health minister says people do need to book for Pfizer (if they are eligible) because of supply issues: With the nature of the Pfizer of vaccine, we do require people who are eligible, now 40- to 49-year-olds to book, and we ask you to do that through the phone system. In regards to the AstraZeneca which is in the ... pharmacies and with primary healthcare providers, you would need to book with your GP. We would encourage you to either phone or walk up if you are over 50 for the AstraZeneca. So under 50 – book. Over 50 – you can walk in. More on the vaccine expansion in Victoria just announced by the acting premier. The commonwealth’s Covid-19 vaccination program will again expand in Victoria to include everyone aged 40 years and over from tomorrow, Friday 28 May. It means more than half of all Victorians will be eligible to receive either the Pfizer or AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccines. Victorians aged 40 to 49 years will be able to access to the Pfizer vaccine at state-run vaccination sites. People aged 40 to 49 years receiving the Pfizer vaccine must book an appointment by calling the Coronavirus Hotline on 1800 675 398 – and can do so now – this is essential as not all vaccination centres will have the Pfizer vaccine available. Victorians aged 50 years and over will continue to receive the AstraZeneca vaccine, either through a state-run vaccination centre or a participating GP clinic. While many vaccination centres are accepting walk-in appointments for people aged 50 years and over, bookings via the 1800 675 398 hotline are preferred. Since launching the first high-volume vaccination centres, the state-run program has expanded rapidly to more than 30 hubs across metropolitan Melbourne and regional Victoria. Victoria has experienced record demand this week for vaccinations and forward bookings.

For more information on the commonwealth’s Covid-19 vaccination program, visit health.vic.gov.au. Brett Sutton gets very cranky when he’s asked what has gone wrong with Victoria’s Covid contact tracing, given that this is the fourth lockdown: That is absurd. To finish, it is an absurd proposition that contact tracing has gone wrong. We have talked about exactly what the contact tracing team have done here and it is extraordinary. Contact tracing is an integral part of how to get control. It does not do magic. Every country in the world started with one or two cases in their countries. Brett Sutton says contact tracers have seen this many primary and secondary contacts this soon before: We haven’t seen that number previously. Part of the reason for the big numbers we’ve seen is there were generations of transmission that occurred before the first case was identified to us. There’s been opportunities to spread to people. The other clear is element is the infectiousness of the virus. When we see a member become infected, almost all the household is infected. It speaks to the infectiousness of this B161 variant, but also the cycles it’s going through. It really is rapid and that’s led to the exponential increase. Victoria’s chief health officer Prof Brett Sutton says the lockdown is necessary, given the number of exposures: I do think we have to ready ourselves for seven days of this lockdown. With, as the acting premier said, thousands of primary and secondary close contacts. They are individuals who have been exposed – any one of them could become cases over the next 14 days from their exposure. So we really just need to see each and every day what new cases might emerge, hopefully, all of the positives will be they have been contacted, they’re in quarantine already, and that when they test positive, there’s no new exposure sites generated. So the things to watch are the new cases that I’m sure will occur but whether or not they’re out and about in the community, whether there’s new exposure sites that are putting others at risk. So they’re the things to watch. It would be great if the new cases I do expect, that they have – they’re amongst those 10,000 primary and secondary close contacts and there aren’t new exposure sites generated. Are vaccine supply concerns the reason the vaccination program hasn’t been opened to everyone? James Merlino: We have a number of reasons why the commonwealth’s vaccine rollout has been delayed. And it has been delayed. That is a fact. It should – we should be at a much higher level, in terms of the number of people vaccinated than today. These are supply issues the commonwealth is responsible for, securing, procuring, and then delivering the supply, so that’s been one of problems. And of course the changes that were announced in regards to AstraZeneca had a hit on public confidence, but the third element is people have got to be willing to be vaccinated. As the minister for health, professor Sutton and other public health experts say, these vaccines are safe. And these vaccines, if people get vaccinated, it keeps our community safe. We would not be in this position that we are today, this necessary and difficult position, that we are today, if our vaccination rates were much higher than they are right now. James Merlino says he knows this will be tough for business and events given that it is the first lockdown since the end of jobkeeper, but he says the Victorian government is looking at support. He does not go into detail about what form that support will take. Will Victorians have to keep living with the threat of lockdown? James Merlino: Well, you go to last year, it was about defeating the second wave and ensuring we don’t have a third wave. But there’s only – there’s only one path to defeating this pandemic, and the successful rollout of the commonwealth’s vaccine program, and an alternative to hotel quarantine, particularly for those who are very, very high risk. Until we get to that point, until we have successfully rolled out the commonwealth’s vaccine program, and we’re stepping up where we can, the announcement we’re making today to extend the eligibility for people who can get a vaccine, from the priority cohorts to now anyone over 40, is what we can do to make sure we get there. But this is the commonwealth’s vaccine program, they’re responsible for supply, right now, we’ve got the supply we need, and that’s why we’re making the call to everyone. No one – no one wants to be where we are today. But this is highly infectious, and it is running at a super quick pace. Is Victoria confident in its contact tracers? James Merlino: They’re doing an extraordinary work. I just go back to what I said in my opening remarks, our contact tracers, within a 24-hour period, are identifying and locking down first, second and third rings of cases. They have never ever worked as hard, as fast, and as effectively as they are right now. But despite that, this variant is moving at a faster pace. So, our contact tracers are doing a brilliant job but we need to get on top of this. That’s why we have advice from public health, given the circumstances, more than 10,000 primary and secondary contacts, more than 150 exposure sites right across the state of Victoria, Bendigo, on our border, right across metropolitan Melbourne, we need to have this circuit-breaker lockdown. We know it works. We know it makes a difference. We’ve done this before. Victorians know what to do. But the contact tracers are working more quickly than they have ever done before. The vaccine booking line for 40- to 49-year-olds in Victoria has already crashed: More testing sites are being set up around Victoria today. There are about 196 of them. On the vaccine program in Melbourne: The ACTU has responded to the lockdown: The Victorian lockdown will be the first to extend beyond a weekend since the Morrison Government prematurely ended the JobKeeper wage subsidy at the end of March, despite an uneven recovery and a failing vaccine rollout which meant that additional lockdowns were likely. A lockdown with no support for jobs, especially those in sectors like hospitality, retail and aviation which are still struggling to recover from the pandemic, means many workers face an uncertain future with no guaranteed connection to work. The Morrison Government bears clear responsibility both for this lockdown, caused by a combination of its lack of action on national quarantine standards and inability to efficiently distribute the vaccine, and for any job losses resulting from its short-sighted decision to end JobKeeper for all. James Merlino then pleads for people who can get vaccinated, to do so – and also pleads with the federal government to move forward with a proper quarantine facility: I can announce that from tomorrow morning, vaccinations at state sites will be expanded to include those in the 40- to 49-year-old age group, for the Pfizer vaccine, so that means now, if our state sites, if you’re over 40, you will eligible for a vaccine. So we need you to call the hotline, we need you to make a booking. In terms of GPs, that will be a decision of the commonwealth, but in terms of the state sites that we run, we’ll be expanding it to 40 to 49, so I really encourage everyone, if you’re eligible, get vaccinated. The reason why we are dealing with this outbreak today is because of a hotel breach in South Australia. That is not a criticism, it is just a fact, we have had breaches in hotel quarantine right around our country. The only way through this pandemic is everyone getting vaccinated as quickly as you are eligible, and for the commonwealth to agree to an alternative quarantine arrangement, particularly for high-risk individuals and, in this case, we’re talking about a variant of concern. If we had – if we had an alternative to hotel for this particular variant of concern, we would not be here today. If we had the vaccine, the commonwealth’s vaccine program effectively rolled out, we may well not be here today, talking about these circuit-breaker restrictions that we must impose to keep our community safe. James Merlino is going through some of the rules: For shopping and exercise, you need to stay within 5km of your home, unless your nearest shops are further away. Masks must be worn everywhere, indoors and outdoors, anywhere other than your home, unless an exemption applies. There are to be no visitors to your home other than an intimate partner. Single bubbles will be permitted. If you live alone, you can make a bubble with another person. And there’s to be no public gatherings. In terms of what remains open, so restaurants, pubs, and cafes can provide takeaway only. Essential retail, so supermarkets, food stores, petrol stations, banks, bottle shops and pharmacies, other retail stores can provide click and collect. Childcare and kinders will be open as per the last circuit-breaker lockdown earlier this year. Approved professional sporting events will proceed but proceed without crowds. Authorised workers and workplaces – in terms of what will be closed or changed, schools will move to remote learning, except for vulnerable children, and children of authorised workers. Higher education will move to remote learning only. Community support and recreation, accommodation, but there will be some exemptions that apply. Hotels, clubs, TABs and the casino will be closed, indoor and outdoor entertainment venues, swimming pools, spas, saunas, indoor and outdoor springs, community venues, drive-in cinemas, amusements parks, creative studios, art galleries and museums, tourism, tours, and transport, and auctions can only happen online. In terms of our health settings, aged care facilities: no visitors except for limited reasons. In our hospitals, visitors only for end of life, to support a partner during birth, or a parent accompanying a child. In terms of ceremonies, funerals: a maximum of 10 people, plus those running the service. Weddings cannot proceed unless end-of-life or deportation reasons apply. And religious activities will not proceed other than through broadcast with a maximum of five people. James Merlino says there is no other choice but to lock down the state, given the speed of the spread of this variant of the virus. Here are the reasons you can leave home: shopping for necessary goods and services authorised work or permitted education exercise – a two-hour limit, with one other person caregiving, compassionate and medical reasons and the fifth: to get vaccinated James Merlino: Our public health experts’ primary concern is how fast this variant is moving. We’ve seen overseas how difficult that movement can be to control. Here in Victoria we’re seeing not only how quick it is but how contagious it is as well. Our contact tracers identifying – are identifying and locking down the first ring, second ring and third ring within 24 hours. They have never done that before. That’s the fastest our contact tracers have ever moved within a 24-hour period, identifying and locking down first, second and third rings of cases. But despite working as fast as this – and my thanks to all of our contact tracers – this variant is moving faster still. The time between catching the virus and passing it on is tighter than ever. For some of those cases I mentioned, for some of them ... how long it takes between the onset of symptoms in the first and secondary case is averaging just over a day. Now, to put that in some perspective, the usual transmission is about five to six days. In some of these cases, within a day it’s been transmitted. The number of cases has doubled in 24 hours. Unless something drastic happens, this will become increasingly uncontrollable. The vaccine rollout has been slower than we have hoped. It’s not where we hoped it would be, it’s not where it should be. If more people were vaccinated, we might be facing a very different set of circumstances than we are today. But sadly we are not. If we make the wrong choice now, if we wait too long, this thing will get away from us. Acting premier James Merlino says one person is in ICU: We said this time yesterday the next 24 hours were going to be particularly critical in terms of what our next steps will be. To ensure we keep our state safe. In the last day, we have seen 12 linked new cases, bringing the total number of cases linked to the hotel quarantine breach in South Australia to 26. Sadly, we have one of those people in an ICU, on a ventilator, in not a very good way. In the last day, we’ve seen more evidence we’re dealing with a highly infectious strain of the virus, a variant of concern, which is running faster than we have ever recorded. There are at least 10,000 primary and secondary contacts who are being required to be isolated. Journalists at the press conference have been handed a statement with the lockdown conditions: Annnnd there has been a small earthquake in regional Victoria: For those asking why is Victoria looking at a lockdown, while NSW didn’t when it had an outbreak in the northern beaches – I’d urge you to look at the geographical spread of where people infected with Covid have visited and just how spread out exposure sites are. It’s a lot easier to contain an outbreak when people are all in the same area – like what happened with the northern beaches. The latest Melbourne outbreak has spread across the city. Queensland is being very Queensland amid all this (I can say that, as a Queenslander). Via AAP: Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk is in talks with the NRL to host the State of Origin opener in 13 days time, following a Covid-19 outbreak in Melbourne. The MCG is currently the venue for the June 9 clash, but that could change if the Victorian capital goes into lockdown from Friday, as expected. The virus cluster in Melbourne’s north expanded to 26 infections as 11 new cases diagnosed on Thursday. Premier Palaszczuk says the Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane or Queensland Country Bank Stadium in Townsville could host the clash on June 9, if needed. “We’re putting our hand up – as I know other states will as well,” Palaszczuk told parliament on Thursday. “We live in rugby league heartland. Queensland is the ideal place to kick off this year’s State of Origin. “I can confirm that we’re in discussions with the NRL.” For the record, no one is saying the states are failing and they want the federal government to “take over” quarantine. I think people just want the federal government to *do* something on quarantine, given that it is a commonwealth responsibility, we are 18 months in, our vaccine program has been delayed, we have thousands of Australians still stranded overseas, eventually we will have to open our international border and we will be living with this virus for years to come. “Fortress Australia” is, and always was, porous. And we still don’t have a plan. This exchange between Stuart Robert and Kieran Gilbert on Sky News yesterday afternoon shows you where the federal government’s attitude to this is at. This was after a question time when Scott Morrison accused Labor of blaming the states after he was questioned about the lack of purpose-built federal quarantine facilities and the slow vaccine rollout: KG: The other question that’s been put, though, is why hasn’t the government, why haven’t you and other ministers said “OK, look, we’ve got to build a purpose-built quarantine facility out of the cities, out of hotels”? Because this Melbourne outbreak’s come out of a hotel. SR: We’ve seen a few issues in Victoria with hotels*. In March last year when the prime minister put together national cabinet, the states were insistent that they were to run quarantine. They’re the ones whose public health orders are being responded to. They’re the ones with the emergency services and health personnel. So it was at the states’ request that quarantine will be run out of states and territories. Now, we’re in this together. We’re working with the states and territories. There’s no criticism – * It’s been all states. The latest outbreak is linked to an Adelaide quarantine hotel. KG: [interrupts] But the prime minister is the prime minister. He’s your friend. He’s the nation’s leader. Why wouldn’t he just say ‘look, we’ve got to build this thing, we’ve got to get it done, take it out of the hotels’? It’s been said to him several times from Jane Halton, from the opposition, from everyone concerned yet it hasn’t been done. SR: The states and territories are still keen to continue to operate it. Now, at the same time … KG: [interrupts] Override them. SR: … over the same time – well, you’ve seen the constitutional powers and the limit of them with trying to keep state borders open and our inability to do that because the states are supreme in their own states. KG: But they’re now saying they want you to build one in northern Victoria, one in Toowoomba. Why is the government not jumping all over this? SR: So, we’ve expanded Howard Springs to 2,000. We’re going through with Victoria now in a very good proposal from Victoria, as the prime minister has said. And the issue in Toowoomba, of course, is we don’t have the details from the Queensland state government. Now, if they gave us all of the detail in the same vein that Victoria has, it may be a different discussion. But we’re working very constructively with Victoria on their proposal. KG: Do you see why some, including the opposition, are saying that the government’s been sitting on its hands on this issue? It’s not like this proposal of getting the quarantine out of hotels hasn’t been around for some months now. SR: Again, we are working with the states and territories, and they were the ones that wanted to run quarantine. Now, states are now coming forward with alternative proposals, and the Victorian one’s a great case in point. We’re working really constructively with them. KG: So does the PM say at the election campaign to people if there’s a massive outbreak, look, it was the states’ fault? Is that where we get to? SR: Well, national cabinet was all about being in this together and doing this together. The decision was made together that states and territories would run quarantine. Now the opposition is saying that it’s not good enough the states and territories are running quarantine. And they’re criticising their state and territory colleagues, which I think is a bit harsh. States and territories are doing their best and they’re having a good crack at this. KG: I think they’re criticising you, to be fair. They’re criticising your government. SR Well, they’re saying we should take it over because they’re saying the states are failing. And I don’t think the states are failing. I think our relationship with the states on this is actually going quite well, and we’ll continue to work … WA has also called a Covid presser – 9.15am WA time, which is 11.15am eastern time – so it looks as though that state will also be banning Melbourne residents. Things got slightly heated over in the legal and constitutional affairs estimates a bit earlier, where Labor senator Kim Carr has been questioning officials from the administrative appeals tribunal about the appointment of former Liberal members. Liberal senator David Van asked the AAT to calculate how much time and expense has been incurred answering Carr’s questions, prompting senator Rex Patrick to accuse him and the Morrison government of being “allergic to oversight”. Van asked Patrick to “step outside” and say the same thing, prompting Patrick to invite Van to look at his tweets, which frequently express similar criticisms. A shouting match ensued. The hearing earlier revealed that Jane Prentice, a former Liberal minister, was appointed in February to the AAT, a body that reviews government decisions, while still working for Counsel House, a lobbying firm. Full-time AAT members must seek approval from the president before taking on other paid work. Carr asked if that approval had been sought and obtained. The AAT officials couldn’t answer the question and took it on notice. Attorney general Michaelia Cash was asked when she first became aware of the matter. She replied: I am aware of it now, Senator Carr, because you’ve just raised it, and it has been taken on notice by the registrar to provide you with more information. Carr also questioned the AAT members about the number of part-time members who either have not finished a case or not worked a single day since being appointed. There were 29 members who had not finalised a case in 2018-19, 18 members in 2019-20, and 18 members in 2019-20. Nine members had not performed a single hour of work in 2018-19 and 2019-20, and 13 in 2020-21. AAT registrar Sian Leathem said that may be explained by resignations, members being appointed late in the financial year or other commitments: There is also the case that we have a number of very specialised members that we only use when there is an operational need to allocate work to them and that would mean they were not allocated any work during the time period. We will get the major update in about 20 minutes. We should be able to bring all those answers you want then. The AFL may also have to prepare for delays: The Senate is holding an inquiry into the commonwealth’s new powers to declare a national emergency, which the prime minister can do unilaterally (without state and territory agreement) in certain circumstances. The National Emergency Declaration Act was passed in December 2020 after the bushfire royal commission, and before what legislators feared could be another horror fire season. Although it is already law, it is interesting that there is quite a lot of dissent from the states – including from Coalition governments in Tasmania and New South Wales. The Tasmanian government submitted to the Senate standing committee on legal and constitutional affairs that it “does not support the commonwealth having power to declare a national emergency without the agreement of, or consultation with, states and territories”. It said: Noting that the circumstances that would trigger a national emergency declaration would be exceptional, the Tasmanian government opposes any unilateral decision, declaration or action that affects Tasmania, or its interests, without prior consultation. NSW argued that the condition of “nationally significant harm” could be open to broad interpretation: Any Commonwealth efforts should be targeted at supporting States and Territories’ lead role in emergency response and recovery operations … [The Act should] be aimed solely at improving Commonwealth arrangements for the provision of expedited assistance to the States, and not operate so as to disrupt or interfere with these arrangements. NSW proposed consideration of “multi-agency national-level exercises” to test how the act could work. The Australian Capital Territory called for a new requirement to inform the governments of all affected states and territories when a national emergency declaration is made, regardless of whether consultation has occurred. The Queensland government said it shares the concerns expressed by other states and territories that the act goes beyond the scope of what was recommended by the bushfire royal commission, in not limiting the powers to natural disasters and not defining an emergency. The other big international news today has been Dominic Cummings, the former chief adviser to Boris Johnson, giving evidence about the UK’s Covid policy: The government has no major campaign in place to combat vaccine hesitancy. The messages from the health minister down, when it comes to AstraZeneca, have been confused – ie, please go out and get AstraZeneca, but we will have more Pfizer and Moderna at the end of the year. Now Richard Colbeck, the aged care minister, while explaining why we still haven’t vaccinated all aged care residents – including 29 centres in Melbourne which are yet to receive a single dose – says “people have made their choice” over whether they want the vaccine or not. We are still waiting to learn when the Victorian press conference will be held. Past experience says that the later it is, the more they have to say – there are a lot of details that need to be covered before announcing changes to health policy. We’ll bring you the updates as soon as we have them. We hope everyone is OK – The public hearing scheduled for today by the select committee on mental health and suicide prevention has been cancelled due to illness. The hearing will be rescheduled and the revised public hearing program will be available on the committee website. The House of Representatives has begun with a Labor thrust at Liberal MP Andrew Laming, as MP Julie Collins moved to suspend standing orders for a motion accusing him of reneging on a commitment to resign his parliamentary roles. At the height of the controversy about his treatment of constituents, Laming said he would “step down from all parliamentary roles effective immediately”. But since returning to parliament from health leave, Laming has refused to give up his position as the chair of a parliamentary committee on employment, education and training. The position adds $23,000 to his annual salary. Laming now points to a 28 March statement in which he announced he had taken “health leave from all parliamentary, electorate and committee work”, claiming he never committed to permanently give up the chair’s role. Education minister Alan Tudge moved that Collins no longer be heard. The government won that vote. Laming then gave a personal explanation, saying he had “never resigned” and “never reneged” from a commitment to resign. He attempted to table a “health statement” about his period of leave but Anthony Albanese objected and it appears leave wasn’t granted. The House has now moved on to other business. For those scratching their heads about what all this achieved – Labor has tried this move every morning this week and now has lots of footage of (male) Coalition ministers moving that female Labor members no longer be heard. This follows on from South Australia yesterday – but the NT is now declaring two areas in Victoria hotspot regions – meaning mandatory quarantine if you arrive in the NT and have been in those areas. Here is the declaration: My directions issued at 5:53pm on 25 May 2021 are revoked and replaced with the following: These directions apply to any person who has arrived or who will arrive in the Northern Territory before 00:01 on 27 May 2021 who has been to any of the locations listed as ‘public exposure sites’ by the Victorian Department of Health on or about the relevant times and dates specified at the following link as updated by the Victorian Department of Health from time to time: https://www.coronavirus.vic.gov.au/exposure-sites 3 Any person who has arrived or who will arrive in the Northern Territory before 00:01 on 27 May 2021 who has been in Victoria since 12 May 2021 must check the above website at least once per day and comply with these directions if a place they have been to becomes a public exposure site. Any person to whom these directions apply who has arrived in the Northern Territory or who will arrive in the Northern Territory before 00:01 on 27 May 2021 who has been to a ‘Tier 1’ site, must travel directly to a suitable place of quarantine and remain in that place, except to submit to testing for COVID-19 (or in an emergency). Once tested, the person must remain in the suitable place of quarantine until noon on the 14th day after the last day the person was in the ‘Tier 1’ site, regardless of whether the result of the test is negative. Note: A person who has already had a test may be required to have further tests, at the direction of an authorised officer. If a public exposure site that was a ‘Tier 1 site’ ceases to be a ‘Tier 1’ site, a person who is in quarantine by reason only of that area formerly being a ‘Tier 1 site’ is not required to remain in quarantine, provided they have been tested for COVID-19 and received a negative result. If a public exposure site that was a ‘Tier 2 site’ or a ‘Tier 3 site’ becomes a ‘Tier 1 site’, a person who has been to the site must travel directly to a suitable place of quarantine and remain in that place, except to submit to testing for COVID-19 (or in an emergency). Once tested, the person must remain in the suitable place of quarantine until noon on the 14th day after the last day the person was in the ‘Tier 1’ site, regardless of whether the result of the test is negative. To avoid doubt, a person to whom these directions apply is considered a person who is required to quarantine under my Directions for Territory Border Restrictions (No.49), and all quarantine requirements under my Directions for Territory Border Restrictions apply. If a place of quarantine is deemed not to be suitable, the CHO will direct quarantine to be undertaken at the Howard Springs or Alice Springs quarantine facilities. People have been preparing for the last few days for a potential lockdown: This is not yet confirmed – we will most likely hear from the acting premier around 10.30 or so now, but it looks very likely: I mean, 18 months on, I think we are very past this conversation. Keep an eye on the exposure list sites here. The Victorian police commissioner has not confirmed the lockdown but says police have been preparing for the possibility: Where are Scott Morrison and Greg Hunt getting the “hotel quarantine has been 99.99% effective” stat from? Mark Butler took a guess while a guest on Steve Price’s livestreamed radio show this morning: I think what they’re doing, and I don’t really know, but I think what they’re doing is they’re just simply using the number of people who’ve gone through hotel quarantine. So that’s quite a lot of people coming home from overseas, and then dividing that by the number of leaks. The problem though is it ignores the fact that every single leak is a massive disaster. The whole city of Melbourne is in huge disruption. I see speculation about the possibility of a lockdown being announced this morning. I don’t know whether that is right but I know that would be enormously distressing. I’m not from Melbourne but my Dad lives in Melbourne. I’ve got other relatives and very close friends there. I know how triggering that would be for a city that was locked down for 111 days last year. To know that 40% of aged care facilities in Melbourne have not been fully vaccinated and I think, scandalously, 29 have not received even a single dose when they were promised all across the country to be vaccinated fully by Easter. Given what we know happened last year, I think must be very distressing for everyone. For those trying to work out the number of Covid cases linked to this latest outbreak in Victoria, it’s at 26. One of the 12 cases was mentioned by James Merlino at yesterday’s press conference. So that makes 11 new cases (the ones we didn’t know about) but 12 in total. Day four of estimates is getting under way – a little bit later in the day we will hear from officials within the finance department who deal with Parliament House staffing issues, so we’ll bring you updates from that. The latest Victoria Health numbers are out: Richard Colbeck was pressed on the 29 Victorian aged care homes who were yet to receive any vaccines (aged care is a federal responsibility) outside the Nine studios: I’m very comfortable with the rollout of the vaccination across the – across the country. About 85% of residents across Australia have taken up the vaccine. And it’s been a significant logistical effort. There’s some providers who have put back their vaccine dates so that the residents can get flu vaccinations. We have worked with the providers to schedule them over the last 12 or 13 weeks to get the vaccines. Here is a rundown of the various reports of a lockdown flagged for Victoria. No detail has been given about whether the lockdown will affect the whole state or just greater Melbourne. The Age reports: “A source close to the government, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the confidential decision, said cabinet was set to confirm final details of the lockdown on Thursday morning before announcing the public health measures.” According to the Age, this lockdown will last at least three days, with the finer details being discussed this morning. The ABC is reporting that the cluster has grown overnight to 25 cases, with reporter Richard Willingham saying the lockdown will last at least five days. This is the problem with government leaks before the official announcement – there is confusion about how long the lockdown will last, and which areas it will affect, creating extra anxiety. There has been no announcement of a press conference yet, we’ll keep you posted when we know the details. We can expect the Victorian state government to continue to push for purpose-built quarantine facilities, given the situation that’s unfolding. Yesterday the deputy premier, James Merlino, urged that more secure quarantine facilities be designed and built, with the outbreak in Victoria originating from a hotel quarantine breach in South Australia: There is a sense of urgency about this. The best time to have had an alternative quarantine facility is 12 months ago and the next best time is now, so we are very keen to finalise those discussions with the commonwealth. There are 29 aged care facilities in Victoria which are yet to receive a single dose of vaccine from the federal government. Aged care minister Richard Colbeck was on the Nine Network this morning explaining why, as Melbourne looks about to enter another lockdown because of a Covid outbreak, sparked from a breach in Adelaide hotel quarantine: They should be done in the next few days. We’ve prioritised those. We’ve been working our way obviously across the country. There’s about 600 facilities that the commonwealth has responsibility for in Victoria. As you said, 29 of those left to be done. They were programmed to be done. They were programmed to be done this week or next week, so we’ll get those finalised as quickly as we can. We’re actually going back over other facilities, particularly in those areas of Melbourne where there has been an outbreak. The average vaccination rate across aged care in Australia is about 85%. There’s some that are lower than that so we’re going back and offering people a second chance to take up a vaccine if that’s what they’d like, given the current circumstances. Scott Morrison has also taken to reminding people how bad Covid could have been in Australia if it weren’t for the measures put in place (largely pushed by the states). Yesterday he accused the opposition of “whinging” about the vaccine rollout and said people stopped him on the street to say how happy they were: I know that Australians – because they approach me every time when I go out into regional Australia or the suburbs and cities of this country – they know here, in this country, they’re living a life during Covid like few are anywhere else in the world. This country has enjoyed safety from this pandemic and an economic recovery like few, if any, other countries in the world. Those opposite, Mr Speaker, may want to retreat into whinging and complaining and undermining the government, as we fight the virus and they focus on the politics. (Nice order of importance there too, in terms of the geographical indicators he used in that sentence.) Kristina Keneally spoke to ABC News Breakfast about that attitude this morning: Well, if we take that argument from the prime minister at face value – well, 17 outbreaks in six months – “You’ve never had it so good, what are you complaining about?” Let me tell you, the people of Melbourne today who are facing the prospect of another extended lockdown, they would disagree with the prime minister. They would say, “You got a report, prime minister, some nine months ago from Jane Halton, your handpicked expert, who told you hotel quarantine is not fit-for-purpose.” Hotels are for tourists, not for quarantine and medical purposes. We rolled it out at the beginning of the pandemic because we needed something quickly. But we now know so much more about this virus, we know it is airborne, we know hotels are not fit-for-purpose for quarantine. Jane Halton gave the prime minister multiple recommendations and he has failed to act on a single one of them. He could be, for example, taking up Victoria’s offer of the Mickleham facility and expanding that. He could be working with Queensland, with their offer to expand and work with him on a national quarantine system in that state. He could be looking at Bladin Point in the Northern Territory. Yet this is a prime minister who thinks that this is not his problem. He wants to shove everything onto the states – everything is someone else’s responsibility, and nothing is his fault. In a national pandemic, and an international pandemic, that is simply not good enough from our prime minister. Looking to some other news at the moment, a significant judgment has just come out of The Hague: A court in The Hague has ordered Royal Dutch Shell to cut its global carbon emissions by 45% by the end of 2030 compared with 2019 levels, in a landmark case brought by Friends of the Earth and over 17,000 co-plaintiffs. The oil giant’s sustainability policy was found to be insufficiently “concrete” by the Dutch court in an unprecedented ruling that will have wide implications for the energy industry and other polluting multinationals. The Anglo-Dutch company was told it had a duty of care and that the level of emission reductions of Shell and its suppliers and buyers should be brought into line with the Paris climate agreement. More than a year on from the start of the pandemic, after hotel quarantine breaches in all states and with no end in sight, you have to wonder why more people aren’t screaming for purpose-built quarantine facilities. Scott Morrison has taken to saying that hotel quarantine is 99.9% effective. But, as we are seeing from one of those 0.01% of failures, which is happening to Melbourne after a breach in an Adelaide quarantine hotel, the cost on communities is very, very high. Hotel quarantine was set up in a couple of weeks in an answer to new problems. Hotels are not set up as quarantine spaces. They have shared ventilation, for starters. We have learnt more about the virus and more about the impact of airborne particles. This is not something the federal government can continue to shrug off. Meanwhile, back in 1950, John “lots of numbers” Troll has something to say about parents in the workplace: We are expecting the Victorian press conference to be held about 9.30am or so. I’m so sorry, Melbourne. We will hopefully be hearing from Victorian authorities soon. The Herald Sun has reported the possibility of a five-day lockdown is on the cards, given the number of exposure sites. That also includes Marvel Stadium – anyone sitting on level one, between rows five and 28 and level three between aisles six and 29 is considered a tier 2 contact – and must get a Covid test and isolate until results come in. (That was Sunday’s Essendon v North Melbourne game.) You may have heard a lot from Peter Dutton lately about defence spending. Daniel Hurst has taken a look at a small slither of that spend: Australia’s defence department has revealed it is spending $37m to hire private helicopters as it grapples with low availability of the trouble-plagued Taipan choppers. The move comes as defence officials concede a fault found in one of the helicopters in 2019 – when it was on its way to pick up the Australian defence force chief, Angus Campbell – could have led to “catastrophic consequences” if left unfixed. It has prompted the opposition to blast the Howard government-era acquisition of the Multi-Role Helicopters (MRH90), also known as Taipans, as “a farce from go to whoa”. Australia needs to avoid adding to a global “race to the bottom” over military ambitions in space, amid concerns that the major powers are seeking to dominate space, according to a new report. The Australian defence force is setting up a space division at the Royal Australian Air Force headquarters in Canberra early next year, with the government planning to spend $7bn on space capabilities over the next decade. The government has also launched an Australian Space Agency. Dr Cassandra Steer, a senior lecturer at the Australian National University’s college of law who specialises in space law, said space was “a critical strategic domain for Australia’s civilian and military interests” but was “increasingly congested, contested and competitive”. She said major powers were engaged in “a destabilising space arms race”, with China, Russia and the US rejecting the strategic restraint that had kept space a stable political and military domain. In a policy options paper published by the ANU’s national security college today, Steer said Australia could act as a “middle space power” and encourage responsible behaviour in space. She argued Australian leaders should “avoid inadvertently contributing to escalatory rhetoric”. That meant avoiding descriptions of space as a “warfighting domain” or a “battlespace”: Australia needs to be careful that, as it develops sovereign space capabilities, it does not accelerate a global strategic race to the bottom. Rather, Australia should focus on its ability to become an effective diplomatic space power – building on our history as a strong contributor to space technologies and arms control norms. The paper calls on the government to invest in space literacy training across the Australian public service and for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to appoint a “space ambassador” with a dedicated team to influence the space agenda internationally. While you were sleeping, US president Joe Biden ordered an intelligence investigation into the origins of the coronavirus. You can read the Guardian’s full story here: We start this morning with the news that the list of exposure sites in Victoria has grown to 70. I think we can expect further social distancing measures to be announced today in response to that – it’s a huge list. It includes a NSW western Riverina sporting club in Tooleybuc, which is near the Victorian border. A positive case attended a football match at Cohuna which the Tooleybuc club was at. Anyone who was at the Cohuna recreation reserve on Saturday 22 May between 12pm and 5pm must get a Covid test and isolate until they receive their results. NSW has already officially asked all residents to rethink any non-urgent travel to greater Melbourne or Bendigo. South Australia has gone further and shut its borders to Melbourne residents as of 6pm last night. We’ll keep across everything that happens as it does, as well as parliament and estimates.

Merlino said on Thursday contact tracers were struggling to keep up despite quickly identifying more than 10,000 primary and secondary contacts and 150 potential exposure sites, as the number of positive cases linked to the cluster reached 26. “The usual transmission is about five to six days. In some of these cases, within a day it’s being transmitted,” Merlino said. “The number of cases has doubled in 24 hours. Unless something drastic happens, this will become increasingly uncontrollable.” The B1617.1 variant, first identified in India, is responsible for Victoria’s cluster. While it is not the most infectious variant in India, it is nonetheless concerning, and at least as infectious as the B.1.1.7 variant prevalent in Britain. “From first thing this morning, we have identified in excess of 10,000 primary and secondary contacts who will need to either quarantine, or test and isolate, and that number will continue to grow and change,” Merlino said. “Our public health experts’ primary concern is how fast this variant is moving. We’ve seen overseas how difficult that movement can be to control. Here in Victoria, we’re seeing not only how quick it is, but how contagious it is as well. “That’s the fastest our contact tracers have ever moved within a 24-hour period, identifying and locking down first, second and third rings of cases. But despite working as fast as this, and my thanks to all of our contact tracers, this variant is moving faster still.” One elderly person with the virus is now in intensive care and on a ventilator, the acting premier said. As of 11:59pm Thursday, the five reasons for Victorians to leave home include shopping for necessary goods and services; authorised work or permitted education; exercise; care giving; and medical reasons, including to get vaccinated. The lockdown will last for seven days. Half of Victorians are now eligible to be vaccinated, as Merlino also announced those aged 40 and above can now book in for the Pfizer vaccine. “The vaccine rollout has been slower than we have hoped,” Merlino said. He added a lack of suitable quarantine facilities and a reluctance from some people to get vaccinated had been frustrating. Since the current outbreak in Victoria, however, record numbers of people have been vaccinated. On Thursday morning, the vaccine booking website had crashed and the hotline was busy. Asked if Victorians should feel angry at the federal government given the slow pace of the rollout and lack of suitable purpose-built quarantine, Merlino responded: “It is a fact that the commonwealth vaccine rollout has been delayed and there are global reasons for that delay. “We have also seen a reluctance from some people to get vaccinated when they are eligible,” he said. “It is a fact that we have aged care facilities where not one person has been vaccinated. These are facts. We need to get this vaccination rolled out as quickly as possible, and that is why we have been doing a lot of work about how we can quickly expand what we offer at our state sites.” Health authorities were also questioned about the state contact-tracing system and whether it had been too slow. The chief health officer, Professor Brett Sutton, said the suggestion was “absurd” and contact tracers had worked quickly. “It is an absurd proposition that contact tracing has gone wrong,” he said. “We have talked about exactly what the contact-tracing team have done here, and it is extraordinary. Contact tracing is an integral part of how to get control. It does not do magic.” Asked why the state was not locked down sooner, Sutton said: “We have to act on the information before us at any time.” Off the back of the news, the Western Australia premier announced a hard border closure with Victoria as of 10am. “This means that travel from Victoria or travel to Western Australia from anyone who has been in Victoria from May 16 will no longer be permitted unless you are an exempt traveller,” he said.","charCount":"4195","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/melissa-davey\">Melissa Davey</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2021/may/27/i-got-out-of-australia-to-be-with-my-dying-mum-but-thousands-remain-in-limbo","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-27T02:57:32Z","webTitle":"I got out of Australia to be with my dying mum, but thousands remain in limbo | Daisy Dumas","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/may/27/i-got-out-of-australia-to-be-with-my-dying-mum-but-thousands-remain-in-limbo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2021/may/27/i-got-out-of-australia-to-be-with-my-dying-mum-but-thousands-remain-in-limbo","fields":{"headline":"I got out of Australia to be with my dying Mum, but thousands remain in limbo","standfirst":"<p>I completed hotel quarantine with two toddlers while grieving.

A rain of fire. A grenade. A “Domshell”. Dominic Cummings’ seven-hour performance before Westminster MPs on Wednesday filled the UK front pages on Thursday, with his condemnation of Boris Johnson’s handling of the pandemic dominating headlines. The Guardian leads with Cummings’ devastating accusation that “tens of thousands of people died who didn’t need to die” during the Covid outbreak in Britain, above a triptych of faces the ousted aide made during the hearing. The Guardian also carried analysis by political editor Heather Stewart calling the hearing self-serving but plausible. The Independent, the i and the Mirror use the same quote for their splashes. The Independent described the hearing as “painting a picture of disarray in No. 10, as the PM said he wanted to be like the ‘mayor of Jaws’ who kept the beach open despite shark attacks”: “Chaos and complacency”, writes the i, calling the evidence “devastating”. The front page quotes a senior official as saying, “We’re f***ked” – a reference to what Cummings alleges deputy cabinet secretary Helen MacNamara said in March 2020. The Mirror’s headline appears over a photo of the PM with his head hanging, titled “Johnson’s shame” and captioned “PM in crisis after explosive claims”. The Telegraph takes a different tack, labelling the accusations from Cummings as “revenge”. Johnson booted his top adviser in November last year following allegations that he had briefed against the PM. “Sources last night raised questions over his motives,” the Telegraph writes, “suggesting the public would see him as bitter”. The paper throws forward to Thursday, when the government will “attempt to fight back” as the health secretary, Matt Hancock, answers questions in the House of Commons before holding a press conference. The Sunday Telegraph editor, Alistair Heath, argues that “Slowly but surely, the side-effects of the lockdown and of the pandemic itself will become more salient, and the death toll itself less so”, in a comment piece titled “Covid could yet destroy Johnson. But not in the way Cummings expects”. The Daily Express calls Cummings’ performance a “tirade”, with the headline: “Yes, mistakes were made but this was pure revenge”. The paper quotes “allies” of the PM calling Cummings “vengeful and embittered”. The Times says “Cummings rains fire on No 10”. It, too, quotes an unnamed government source’s claim that Cummings “was motivated by revenge and that his comments represented a ‘character assassination’ that was not backed by evidence”. The front page comment calls the hearing “primal chaos, as molten and Sicilian as anything disgorged by Mount Etna” and “longer and bloodier than Hamlet”. “Only in England could a major health ding-dong include a cameo for a Jack Russell” – a reference to Cummings saying that the PM and his girlfriend, Carrie Symonds, distracted the PM from the pandemic because she was “going completely crackers” about press coverage of their dog. The FT and the Yorkshire Post take their headlines from Cummings’ one-word response – “No” – when asked whether the prime minister was a fit and proper person to lead the country through the pandemic: The Daily Record’s headline is “Blood on your hands”, beside a photo of the prime minister. The paper’s story on the hearing takes up no fewer than pages “4,5,6,7,8&amp;9”. The Daily Mail – and sister paper Metro – are peerless in the pun department, with “Domshell”. Its front page also brands the PM “shopping trolley Boris”, after Cummings portrayed Johnson as making constant U-turns “like a shopping trolley smashing from one side of the aisle to the other”. The Scotsman sums up the spectacle as “The Cummings Grenade”, including in its main dot points Cummings’ assertion that SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon undermined the four-nations response to the pandemic. Cummings said in the hearings, “As soon as you had these meetings Nicola Sturgeon would just go straight out announce what she wanted straight afterwards,” and called the meetings “Potemkin”. In other coverage, former justice secretary David Gauke said in an appearance on BBC Newsnight: “It strikes me that with Dominic Cummings you’re either brilliant or you’re useless and clearly he’s consigned Matt Hancock to the second category. That’s not my experience.” Asked by Emily Maitlis whether Cummings’ apology for lives lost meant Johnson should apologise, too, Gauke said: “Well I think it probably does and I think it’s very difficult for the government to argue that these are matters that should only be looked at in due course after an enquiry.”","charCount":"4628","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/helen-sullivan\">Helen Sullivan</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2021/may/27/thousands-of-youtube-comments-on-sky-news-australia-video-celebrate-blm-activist-being-shot-in-head","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-27T02:32:34Z","webTitle":"Thousands of YouTube comments on Sky News Australia video celebrate BLM activist being shot in head","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/may/27/thousands-of-youtube-comments-on-sky-news-australia-video-celebrate-blm-activist-being-shot-in-head","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2021/may/27/thousands-of-youtube-comments-on-sky-news-australia-video-celebrate-blm-activist-being-shot-in-head","fields":{"headline":"Thousands of YouTube comments on Sky News Australia video celebrate BLM activist being shot in head","standfirst":"<p><strong>Exclusive:</strong> The racist and violent comments appear below a video news report about Sasha Johnson who was shot in the head in London</p>","trailText":"<strong>Exclusive:</strong> The racist and violent comments appear below a video news report about Sasha Johnson who was shot in the head in London","byline":"Amanda Meade","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7c2c3213ef5a8dd81d247b6601f8c5a2c4f67438\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c2c3213ef5a8dd81d247b6601f8c5a2c4f67438/0_81_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sasha Johnson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Black Lives Matter activist Sasha Johnson speaking in London in late 2020.

Under Australia’s welfare system, about 300,000 jobseekers whose primary barrier to work is disability are sent to the disability employment services program, which sometimes has more relaxed mutual obligations than the larger jobactive scheme, which has about one million participants. The government’s 2018 reforms sought to increase competition within the Des program by allowing jobseekers to choose their provider, boosting bonus fees for getting the most disadvantaged into work and loosening the requirements for agencies to refer the unemployed to education courses. These bonus fees – known as outcome payments – can be claimed by a provider after they complete a set number of weeks of employment or education, with the fees varying depending on the person’s circumstances. Des providers get their remaining 40% of revenue from service fees for coaching jobseekers, matching them with jobs, connecting with employers, and administrative tasks such as overseeing job search requirements, known as mutual obligations. Internal documents reveal the Boston Consulting Report was triggered in part due to departmental fears of “emerging trend where participants assigned to a higher funding level are being channelled into education activities as opposed to employment”. This prompted a department crackdown which included “locking down IT systems to ensure providers cannot influence participant eligibility for education outcomes”. It’s understood the department took action to stop providers lowering a person’s education qualifications in the system, which had allowed job agencies to claim a higher bonus fee from the government. Boston Consulting Group then warned there was “limited evidence” the increase in education fees claimed meant jobseekers were graduating their courses, or that they were being “enrolled in courses which relate to their employment prospects”. Jobseekers were pleased they could choose their provider, the report said, but they were still concerned providers’ “support was not individualised” and jobs offered were often unsuitable. One jobseeker told the review, “We are just money to them. It’s a pay packet, they don’t listen.” Employers told the review they dealt with “poorly skilled staff who lack an understanding of the corporate environment” and were “flooded with inappropriate applications”. The review also found providers’ efforts to offer a quality service were hampered by “compliance and administrative burdens”, such as administering mutual obligations, which might be better handled by Centrelink. The review’s recommendations included tightening bonuses paid to providers for education outcomes, considering whether to combine jobactive and Des into a single program, and reassessing the funding the government provides for “effective program oversight”. Kristin O’Connell, an Australian Unemployed Workers’ Union spokesperson, said the report was “damning evidence about the failures of privatised employment services”. She said some of the money would be better spent lifting payments for welfare recipients. The Greens senator Rachel Siewert said that while she supported increased spending on employment services, extra money that went to providers should lead to better outcomes for jobseekers. The report showed this was not the case. Anne Ruston, the social services minister, said the government’s 2018 reforms were aimed at giving jobseekers more options and improving competition between providers. While she said there had been positive progress, “further refinement” was needed to make the program more efficient. Ruston said “upskilling and retraining can be important”, but added: “Clearly, we have a situation where some providers have an overemphasis on education outcomes that are not leading to jobs and this needs to be addressed.” “In the 2021-22 budget we have already acted on this and now service providers will only be paid for an education outcome when courses align with the National Skills Commission skill shortage reports,” she said. Ruston said the government would also allow jobseekers to request to join the new digital employment service. It is also working on an updated provider star rating system, which was also criticised in the report. The National Employment Services Association was approached for comment.","charCount":"6071","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/luke-henriques-gomes\">Luke Henriques-Gomes</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2021/may/27/australian-court-finds-government-has-duty-to-protect-young-people-from-climate-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-27T01:50:32Z","webTitle":"Australian court finds government has duty to protect young people from climate crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/may/27/australian-court-finds-government-has-duty-to-protect-young-people-from-climate-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2021/may/27/australian-court-finds-government-has-duty-to-protect-young-people-from-climate-crisis","fields":{"headline":"Australian court finds government has duty to protect young people from climate crisis","standfirst":"<p>Eight teenagers, along with 86-year-old nun, launched case to prevent the approval of a massive coalmine</p>","trailText":"Eight teenagers, along with 86-year-old nun, launched case to prevent the approval of a massive coalmine","byline":"Adam Morton Environment editor","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2ce9b56d7160e32136537f15f70abaad0b1928e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ce9b56d7160e32136537f15f70abaad0b1928e4/0_55_1362_817/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sister Brigid Arthur, 86, and Anj Sharma, 16, are among a group who secured a judgment from the Australian federal court that found the government has a duty to protect young people from climate change. \" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sister Brigid Arthur, 86, and Anj Sharma, 16, are among a group who secured a judgment from the Australian federal court that found the government has a duty to protect young people from climate change. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>The federal court of Australia has found the environment minister, Sussan Ley, has a duty of care to protect young people from the climate crisis in a judgment hailed by lawyers and teenagers who brought the case as a world first.</p> <p>Eight teenagers and an octogenarian nun <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/mar/02/a-duty-of-care-australian-teenagers-take-their-climate-crisis-plea-to-court\">had sought an injunction</a> to prevent Ley approving a proposal by Whitehaven Coal to expand the Vickery coalmine in northern New South Wales, arguing the minister had a common law duty of care to protect younger people against future harm from climate change.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.judgments.fedcourt.gov.au/judgments/Judgments/fca/single/2021/2021fca0560?fbclid=IwAR17zXvBrYMYtiigGtqLr58dMBKzW1M6n1XFqJPGnT3_fFzXhaGEhHNtzLU\">Justice Mordecai Bromberg found </a>the minister had a duty of care to not act in a way that would cause future harm to younger people.

Eight teenagers and an octogenarian nun had sought an injunction to prevent Ley approving a proposal by Whitehaven Coal to expand the Vickery coalmine in northern New South Wales, arguing the minister had a common law duty of care to protect younger people against future harm from climate change. Justice Mordecai Bromberg found the minister had a duty of care to not act in a way that would cause future harm to younger people. But he did not grant the injunction as he was not satisfied the minister would breach her duty of care. David Barnden, a lawyer representing the children, said it was a historic and “amazing decision” with potentially significant consequences. “The court has found that the minister owes a duty of care to younger children, to vulnerable people, and that duty says that the minister must not act in a way that causes harm – future harm – from climate change to younger people,” he said outside court. “It is the first time in the world that such a duty of care has been recognised, especially in a common law country.” He said Bromberg had indicated he would now take submissions before making further declarations about what the minister’s duty of care may mean for whether the mine extension could go ahead. Whitehaven Coal had a different interpretation of the judgment. In a statement to the stock exchange, it did not mention the duty of care finding, and said it welcomed the court dismissing the teenagers’ attempt to block Ley from approving the mine extension. “Our consistent position has been that this legal claim was without merit,” it said. “Whitehaven looks forward to receiving the … approval for the Vickery extension project and will keep the market updated as appropriate.” Speaking for the children, 17-year-old Ava Princi said it was “thrilling and deeply relieving” that the justice had recognised the minister had a duty of care. “I am thrilled because this is a landmark decision,” she said. “My future and the future of all young people depends on Australia stepping away from fossil fuel projects and joining the world in taking decisive climate action.” She said though an injunction was not granted the case was “not over yet”. “There will be further submissions on what the duty of care means for the minister’s decision and the mine,” she said The teenagers, led by the 16-year-old Melbourne student Anj Sharma and supported by Sister Brigid Arthur, an 86-year-old nun and former teacher who volunteered to be their litigation guardian, argued Ley would be breaching a common law duty of care if she used her powers under national environment laws to allow Whitehaven Coal to extend the Vickery mine. The court heard the expansion of the mine could lead to an extra 100m tonnes of CO2 – about 20% of Australia’s annual climate footprint – being released into the atmosphere as the extracted coal is shipped overseas and burned to make steel and generate electricity. In his judgment, Bromberg said the evidence presented to the court showed the potential harm the children could face due to global heating “may fairly be described as catastrophic, particularly should global average surface temperatures rise to and exceed 3C beyond the pre-industrial level”. “Perhaps the most startling of the potential harms demonstrated by the evidence before the court, is that one million of today’s Australian children are expected to suffer at least one heat-stress episode serious enough to require acute care in a hospital,” he said. “Many thousands will suffer premature death from heat stress or bushfire smoke. Substantial economic loss and property damage will be experienced. The Great Barrier Reef and most of Australia’s eastern eucalypt forests will no longer exist due to repeated, severe bushfires.” Bromberg found that the minister had a common law duty to take reasonable care not to cause the children personal injury when using her powers under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act. He did not grant an injunction to prevent the mine extension because he had “not been satisfied that a reasonable apprehension of breach of the duty of care by the minister has been established”. Ley’s office was asked for its response to the judgment. The case is one of a number of climate-related litigation cases expected before Australian courts and tribunals in the months ahead as lawyers and activists aim to use the law to force change they say is not coming quickly enough from Canberra or state governments. There have been a growing number of international cases that aim to hold governments to account for not doing more to address global heating. In the latest on Wednesday, a court in the Hague ordered Royal Dutch Shell to cut its global carbon emissions by 45% by the end of 2030 compared with 2019 levels after finding the oil giant’s sustainability policy was insufficiently “concrete”. The Anglo-Dutch company was told it had a duty of care and that the level of emission reductions of Shell and its suppliers and buyers should be brought into line with the Paris climate agreement. The case had been brought by Friends of the Earth and over 17,000 co-plaintiffs.","charCount":"5395","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/adam-morton\">Adam Morton</a> Environment editor"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2021/may/27/covid-restrictions-victoria-new-greater-melbourne-and-vic-coronavirus-rules-explained","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-27T01:48:05Z","webTitle":"Covid Victoria lockdown restrictions: new Melbourne and Vic coronavirus rules explained","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/may/27/covid-restrictions-victoria-new-greater-melbourne-and-vic-coronavirus-rules-explained","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2021/may/27/covid-restrictions-victoria-new-greater-melbourne-and-vic-coronavirus-rules-explained","fields":{"headline":"Covid Victoria lockdown restrictions: new Melbourne and Vic coronavirus rules explained","standfirst":"<p>New Victorian Covid-19 restrictions have been announced in response to a growing number of cases in a Melbourne suburbs coronavirus outbreak.

From 11.59pm Thursday, 27 May until 11.59pm Thursday 3 June, the following rules apply to the entire state of Victoria – not just Melbourne. When can I leave my house? You cannot leave your home unless it is for one of five approved reasons. The reasons are: shopping; authorised work or education; exercise; caregiving, compassionate and medical reasons; and to get vaccinated. Those first four reasons are the same as previous lockdowns, and the fifth reason – to get vaccinated – is new. How far can I travel from home? For shopping and exercise, you need to stay within 5km of your home. What are the rules for exercise? There is a two-hour limit on exercise, and can only be with one other person, and you must stay within 5km of your home. What are the rules for wearing face masks? Masks must be worn everywhere except for in your home. This includes both indoor places and outdoor areas – unless you have a medical exemption. This rule applies to all of Victoria. Can I have visitors to my house? No visitors are allowed to your home, other than an intimate partner. People who live alone will be able to form a “single bubble”. If you live alone, you can make a bubble with another person, who can visit you. Can I travel interstate? Each state and territory is updating guidance on travel rules individually: Queensland New South Wales South Australia Western Australia Tasmania Australian Capital Territory Northern Territory What about public gatherings? Public gatherings are not allowed. What is happening with schools? Schools will move to remote learning, except for vulnerable children and the children of essential workers. Higher education will also move to remote learning. Childcare centres and kindergartens are still open. Can I dine in at a restaurant or cafe? No. Restaurants, cafes and pubs will be open for takeaway only. Are the shops open? Essential retail, such as supermarkets, petrol, pharmacies, bottle shops and banks, will be open. But other shops will be open only for click and collect. What about weddings, funerals and religious services? Only 10 people will be allowed to attend funerals in person. No weddings are allowed unless for end of life or deportation reasons. No religious activities are allowed in person beyond five people. What about aged care and hospitals? No visitors are allowed at aged care facilities except for limited reasons.

Four more winners of the $1m prize and four college scholarship winners will be announced each Wednesday for the next four weeks. The state’s Republican governor, Mike DeWine, announced the program 12 May to boost lagging vaccination rates. More than 2.7 million adults registered for the money prize and more than 100,000 children ages 12 to 17 entered for the scholarship, which includes tuition, room and board, and books.

Vax-a-Million is open to permanent Ohio residents who have received either the one-dose Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine or their first part of the two-dose Pfizer or Moderna vaccination. DeWine’s proposal inspired similar vaccine-incentive lotteries in Colorado, Maryland, New York state and Oregon. In Colorado, governor Jared Polis says the state will have a weekly lottery for five residents to win $1m Tuesday, and is using federal coronavirus relief funds to do so. Other states are also providing incentives to encourage vaccinations. In New Jersey, residents 21 and older can get a free beer after receiving their first vaccination. Maine residents who get their first shot of the vaccine before the end of May can choose from several outdoor-themed prizes including fishing or hunting licenses or day passes to state parks.","charCount":"2671","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"Guardian staff and agency"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2021/may/27/afl-scrambles-again-as-melbourne-lockdown-causes-chaos-for-sport","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-27T01:26:41Z","webTitle":"AFL scrambles again as Melbourne lockdown causes chaos for sport","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/may/27/afl-scrambles-again-as-melbourne-lockdown-causes-chaos-for-sport","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2021/may/27/afl-scrambles-again-as-melbourne-lockdown-causes-chaos-for-sport","fields":{"headline":"AFL scrambles again as Melbourne lockdown causes chaos for sport","standfirst":"<ul><li>Games in Melbourne to go ahead but without crowds</li><li>Richmond’s match against Adelaide moved to Sydney </li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/may/27/covid-restrictions-victoria-new-greater-melbourne-and-vic-coronavirus-rules-explained\">Victoria’s new Covid lockdown restrictions explained</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/may/27/covid-19-melbourne-exposure-sites-hotspots-list-victoria-metro-regional-vic-coronavirus-cases-outbreak-locations\">Full list of case alerts and public exposure sites in Victoria</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2021/may/27/coronavirus-australia-live-updates-victoria-braces-for-potential-lockdown-to-contain-melbourne-outbreak-covid-cases-restrictions-scott-morrison-brittany-higgins-james-merlino-nsw-border-closure-afl-crowds-exposure-sites-mcg\">Follow LIVE Covid updates on Thursday as Victoria goes into seven-day lockdown</a></li></ul>","trailText":"The AFL is again scrambling to keep its season on track as Victorians prepared to enter a seven-day circuit-breaker lockdown in response to the growing Covid-19 cluster","byline":"Guardian sport","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"933cfdb538e7fbb21c899c983c07cc7f072bfbbe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/933cfdb538e7fbb21c899c983c07cc7f072bfbbe/0_365_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The MCG\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The MCG was due to host two games this weekend.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Cianflone/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>The AFL is again scrambling to keep its season on track as Victorians prepared to enter a seven-day circuit-breaker lockdown in response to the growing Covid-19 cluster.</p> <p>Victorian health officials announced on Thursday 11 new cases, taking the total number in the recent outbreak to 26 and throwing the AFL’s plans into chaos.</p> <p>The state’s acting premier, James Merlino, confirmed approved sporting events would go ahead this week, but without crowds.</p> <p>But Richmond’s match against Adelaide – originally scheduled to be played at the MCG on Sunday – has been moved to Sydney following the closure of South Australia’s border with Victoria, while the Gold Coast’s game with Hawthorn in Darwin on Saturday has been postponed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/may/26/afl-confirms-crowds-at-melbourne-games-despite-covid-outbreak-and-mcg-virus-alert\">Victoria AFL clubs in lockdown as second fan at weekend match tests positive for Covid</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Hawks were one of three Melbourne teams with interstate matches this week who made plans to leave the city earlier than scheduled to avoid getting trapped by a lockdown.

Victorian health officials announced on Thursday 11 new cases, taking the total number in the recent outbreak to 26 and throwing the AFL’s plans into chaos. The state’s acting premier, James Merlino, confirmed approved sporting events would go ahead this week, but without crowds. But Richmond’s match against Adelaide – originally scheduled to be played at the MCG on Sunday – has been moved to Sydney following the closure of South Australia’s border with Victoria, while the Gold Coast’s game with Hawthorn in Darwin on Saturday has been postponed. The Hawks were one of three Melbourne teams with interstate matches this week who made plans to leave the city earlier than scheduled to avoid getting trapped by a lockdown. Essendon and Carlton managed to escape on Wednesday, but Hawthorn were unable to fly to the Northern Territory on Thursday. More fixture changes were likely, with the Demons’ top-of-the-table clash with the Western Bulldogs on Friday night in jeopardy after reports that a player attended a Covid exposure site earlier this week. All 10 Victorian clubs were on Wednesday ordered into an AFL-imposed lockdown and were told they face restrictions for at least the next seven days, with players and staff asked to leave only for playing, training and essential other reasons. It comes after two venues – the MCG and Marvel Stadium – were visited on Sunday by people who later tested positive for the coronavirus. Given the volume of clubs based in Melbourne, the AFL is the league most affected by the new measures. The NRL remains relatively unaffected with the Storm already in camp on the Gold Coast and intending to extend their stay in Queensland beyond Thursday night’s game in Brisbane. But the NRL was expected to make a call on the opening State of Origin game, scheduled to take place at the MCG on 9 June. Peter V’landys said the league would consult with biosecurity experts before making a decision, with Canberra, Perth and Adelaide shaping up as alternative venue options. Queensland also put up its hand to host the opener after state premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said she was in talks with the NRL over a possible switch to either Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane or Queensland Country Bank Stadium in Townsville. Super Netball club Melbourne Vixens also left the state earlier than planned due to the outbreak, bringing forward their departure to Queensland from Friday to Wednesday. The Collingwood Magpies were due to travel to Sydney on Thursday, two days earlier than expected, while the Sydney-based Giants – who had been in Melbourne last weekend – flew to Perth in the morning.","charCount":"2791","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/guardian-sport\">Guardian sport</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"}]}}

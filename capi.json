However there were signs a surge in testing and extending vaccinations to younger residents suggested the surge was subsiding. That meant the city could move down a level on 5 June.</p> <p>“It would be premature to move Glasgow out of tier 3 immediately while the situation remains so fragile. However, if the incidents continue to stabilise and assuming levels of hospitalisations remain reasonably stable, the incident management team would support moving to tier 2 at the end of next week,” she said.</p> <p>She told a media briefing that Scotland’s R number, the rate at which cases are increasing or falling, could as high as 1.3, which showed infections were multiplying. That was largely driven by the growth of cases in Glasgow. At least 50% of cases in Scotland are from the April 2.0 variant from India.</p> <p>Case numbers had jumped by more than a quarter in the past week, with the 641 cases in the last 24 hours the highest daily figure since 25 March. That meant the Scottish government could decide not to move Scotland as a whole down to tier 1 on 7 June, as currently planned, she said.</p> <p>Sturgeon said the number of people in Scottish hospitals had risen to 90 overnight, up by seven; the number in intensive care up two to six, and there had been two deaths of people with confirmed infections. </p> <p>She said the growth in vaccinations, with nearly 2m people now having their second doses, and 3.2m with their first dose. That gave her “cause for real hope” that vaccinations would greatly reduce the impact and lethality of the virus, which would suppress hospitalisations. That would, in time, allow more relaxing of current lockdown restrictions.</p> <p>Sturgeon added that she had heard vociferous complaints from business people and opposition leaders about the very short notice previously given for changes to Glasgow’s lockdown level. She would announce on Wednesday whether the city would be moving down or remain in tier 3 on Saturday.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-05-28T13:17:40.854Z\">at 2.17pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-60b0d5be8f088d8c3178bd6e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-05-28T11:37:40.235Z\">12.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Sturgeon says the outbreak is concentrated among younger age groups, giving hope that the vaccination process is being effective in protecting older people.</p> <p>“We are monitoring very carefully, whether and to what extent, the vaccine is breaking or weakening the link between case numbers and cases of serious illness and death,” she said.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-05-28T13:18:00.658Z\">at 2.18pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-60b0d35b8f086d71cc15d61c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-05-28T11:35:58.272Z\">12.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Nicola Sturgeon gives Covid press conference</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Scotland’s first minister is giving a briefing on the latest situation in Scotland with Covid.</p> <p>She says that 3,196,051 have had their first dose and 1,971,006 have had both jabs.

Glasgow is one of the areas in Scotland that has been hard-hit by this variant, although the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has said the number of new cases is now falling in some parts of the city that were affected.</p> <p>Sarah Crofts, head of analytical outputs for the Covid-19 Infection Survey, said the team would continue to closely monitor infection rates as restrictions ease.</p> <p>“Today’s figures show that while infections remain low across the UK at around 4% of the levels seen at the start of the year, there are signs of recent increases in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland,” she said. “We have seen a rise in cases that are not compatible with the UK variant, suggesting that we may be seeing the first signs of variant B.1.617.2 in our data.”</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-05-28T13:23:22.198Z\">at 2.23pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-60b0c36b8f08d486a7715a5f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-05-28T10:26:42.785Z\">11.26am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Relations between Boris Johnson and Simon Case, the head of the civil service, have plunged into mistrust after former top aide Dominic Cummings’ evidence to two select committees on Wednesday, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/770e7eb5-24a1-4cd7-9427-829398f7afc6\">the Financial Times reports</a>.</p> <p>Cummings told the hearing that he had brought in Case to be permanent secretary as he believed the prime minister was no longer listening to him on Covid-19.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Five well-placed figures in the civil service said relations between Johnson and Case were precarious, in part due to his ties to the former Downing Street adviser.

NHS England said 32,509,194 were the first dose of a vaccine, a rise of 223,510 on the previous day, while 20,777,366 were a second dose, an increase of 374,042. NHS England data shows a total of 6,738,865 jabs were given to people in London in the same period, including 4,254,710 first doses and 2,484,155 second doses. This compares with 6,125,936 first doses and 4,005,671 second doses given to people in the Midlands, a total of 10,131,607.

Edwin Poots was speaking after Foster indicated that, if he names his ministerial team next Tuesday as expected, she will step down immediately. She had previously said she would remain as first minister until the end of June. She left her role as party leader on Friday. Poots is set to be the first DUP leader not to take the position of first minister. He has said he will nominate a colleague in order to allow himself to focus on leading the party, Speaking to the media in Belfast on Friday afternoon, he reiterated that he has no plans to push Foster out. I have said Arlene will leave at a time of Arlene’s choosing, I am not pushing Arlene out. That’s my position and that remains my position. I am not going to be rushed into doing anything or pushed into doing anything, nor am I going to be denied doing something that I am ready to do. We will look at all of these issues and take a decision at a time that is appropriate for us. I’ll reveal the ministerial line-up whenever I am ready to reveal my ministerial line-up, and that’s after I have continued my consultation process with my colleagues. A Covid recovery summit involving the leaders of all four UK and devolved governments could take place next week, after yesterday’s mooted event was cancelled at short notice following protests from the Scottish and Welsh governments. The summit was proposed by Boris Johnson, the prime minister, on 6 May after the Scottish National party came within one seat of winning an overall majority in the Holyrood elections and Welsh Labour won 50% of the seats in the Welsh Senedd. Seen as the opening gambit in a much more conciliatory approach by the Tories in London following an upsurge in support for independence in both nations, the summit had been due to be held on Thursday 27 May. But, amid recriminations from Downing Street, the event was cancelled after Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, and her Welsh counterpart, Mark Drakeford, said the agenda for the event was far too woolly. Sturgeon said on Friday officials in the UK, Welsh, Scottish and Northern Irish administrations were now working on a much more “meaningful, substantive” agenda for a rearranged event, which she hoped would put a heavy emphasis on economic recovery and future spending. “We want the focus of the summit, not exclusively, but as a priority to be on these areas where there’s an intersection between devolved and reserved responsibilities where there’s a real need for as far as possible to cooperate. “And the economy and the economic recovery is the absolute heart of that. Within that there’s what’s going to happen with furlough; what’s going to happen with public spending over the short to medium term. “[And] while nothing has been confirmed yet, we are all hopeful that there will be a date next week where this summit will actually take place.” The Covid-19 R number, which reflects how many people an infected person passes the virus to, has risen slightly from between 0.9 to 1.1 last week, to 1.0 to 1.1 this week, according to Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) and Sage estimates for England. It shows that cases are growing fastest in London and the north-west, at between 0% to 3% and 0% to 4% every day respectively. Both areas have been hit by the India variant. The overall English growth rate range is between 0% to 3%, another adjustment upwards from -2% to 1% last week. We’ve got more on the situation in Glasgow from our Scotland editor, Severin Carrell (see 12:35) after the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said the city would remain in level 3 amid a rise in Covid case rates. The latest Office for National Statistics report also found a jump in cases in Scotland and Northern Ireland, as Nicola Davis has more information on (see 12.14). Live performances can take place in hospitality venues in Wales from Friday but will still be subject to public health restrictions. Groups are limited to six people from six households while two metres social distancing is required for audiences, as well as performers if it’s practical. PA Media reports that Welsh government guidance says there must be “effective ventilation”, one-way systems and people should continue to wear masks indoors. A single-shot coronavirus vaccine from Johnson &amp; Johnson has been approved for use in the UK. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, welcomed the news. He said: “This is a further boost to the UK’s hugely successful vaccination programme, which has already saved over 13,000 lives, and means that we now have four safe and effective vaccines approved to help protect people from this awful virus. “As Janssen is a single-dose vaccine, it will play an important role in the months to come as we redouble our efforts to encourage everyone to get their jabs and potentially begin a booster programme later this year.” Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed Glasgow will remain in Scotland’s second toughest lockdown regime for at least another week, and warned Scotland as a whole may not move down a tier, after Covid cases continued to rise. The first minister said the latest infection and hospitalisation figures in Greater Glasgow and Clyde showed cases continued to rise, so it would be unwise to move the city down from tier 3 to 2 this weekend, or face an upsurge in cases. Glasgow’s case rates had jumped from 112 per 100,000 people to 146 per 100,000, with a test positivity rate of around 4%, she said. However there were signs a surge in testing and extending vaccinations to younger residents suggested the surge was subsiding. That meant the city could move down a level on 5 June. “It would be premature to move Glasgow out of tier 3 immediately while the situation remains so fragile. However, if the incidents continue to stabilise and assuming levels of hospitalisations remain reasonably stable, the incident management team would support moving to tier 2 at the end of next week,” she said. She told a media briefing that Scotland’s R number, the rate at which cases are increasing or falling, could as high as 1.3, which showed infections were multiplying. That was largely driven by the growth of cases in Glasgow. At least 50% of cases in Scotland are from the April 2.0 variant from India. Case numbers had jumped by more than a quarter in the past week, with the 641 cases in the last 24 hours the highest daily figure since 25 March. That meant the Scottish government could decide not to move Scotland as a whole down to tier 1 on 7 June, as currently planned, she said. Sturgeon said the number of people in Scottish hospitals had risen to 90 overnight, up by seven; the number in intensive care up two to six, and there had been two deaths of people with confirmed infections. She said the growth in vaccinations, with nearly 2m people now having their second doses, and 3.2m with their first dose. That gave her “cause for real hope” that vaccinations would greatly reduce the impact and lethality of the virus, which would suppress hospitalisations. That would, in time, allow more relaxing of current lockdown restrictions. Sturgeon added that she had heard vociferous complaints from business people and opposition leaders about the very short notice previously given for changes to Glasgow’s lockdown level. She would announce on Wednesday whether the city would be moving down or remain in tier 3 on Saturday. Sturgeon says the outbreak is concentrated among younger age groups, giving hope that the vaccination process is being effective in protecting older people. “We are monitoring very carefully, whether and to what extent, the vaccine is breaking or weakening the link between case numbers and cases of serious illness and death,” she said. Scotland’s first minister is giving a briefing on the latest situation in Scotland with Covid. She says that 3,196,051 have had their first dose and 1,971,006 have had both jabs. Case numbers are on the rise, with Friday having the highest figures since 25 March and the R number being as high as 1.3. Sturgeon goes on to add that there is “cause for concern” with outbreaks in Glasgow and that Scotland is entering a “transition phase” that allows the country to deal with the virus which people have a much greater sense of normality. Covid infection levels are showing signs of a substantial uptick in Scotland, likely driven by the variant of concern first detected in India, new data reveals. According to data published on Friday from the Office for National Statistics, which conducts a survey based on swabs from randomly selected households,an estimated 8,300 people in Scotland are thought to have had Covid in the week ending 22 May, equating to around 1 in 630 people. The team warn that the small number of tests and a low number of positives mean there is uncertainty about the figure, giving a likely range of between 1 in 1,180 and 1 in 380 people having had Covid in the week ending 22 May. However this marked shift compared with the week before when around around 1 in 1,960 people were thought to have had Covid in Scotland, with the likely range from 1 in 5,160 to 1 in 1,010 people. The data came as government figures for cases of Covid in Scotland reached levels not seen since the end of March, with 546 new cases reported on Wednesday and 464 on Thursday. Hospitalisations have also been rising – although far less dramatically than would have been expected before the vaccination programme began – with 98 patients in hospital with Covid on 26 May, up from 58 on 6 May. While the estimates of infection levels appear fairly steady in England – an estimated 1 in 1,120 people in the community were estimated to have had Covid in the week ending 22 May compared with 1 in 1,110 in the week before – experts say there are still signs of a rise over the past two weeks. Crucially, because the ONS data is based on a survey of randomly selected households across the country, it may not pick up a rise in cases linked to outbreaks located in hotspots. The ONS suggests the upticks in the latest data could be linked to outbreaks of the variant of concern first detected in India, B.1.617.2. Glasgow is one of the areas in Scotland that has been hard-hit by this variant, although the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has said the number of new cases is now falling in some parts of the city that were affected. Sarah Crofts, head of analytical outputs for the Covid-19 Infection Survey, said the team would continue to closely monitor infection rates as restrictions ease. “Today’s figures show that while infections remain low across the UK at around 4% of the levels seen at the start of the year, there are signs of recent increases in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland,” she said. “We have seen a rise in cases that are not compatible with the UK variant, suggesting that we may be seeing the first signs of variant B.1.617.2 in our data.” Relations between Boris Johnson and Simon Case, the head of the civil service, have plunged into mistrust after former top aide Dominic Cummings’ evidence to two select committees on Wednesday, the Financial Times reports. Cummings told the hearing that he had brought in Case to be permanent secretary as he believed the prime minister was no longer listening to him on Covid-19. Five well-placed figures in the civil service said relations between Johnson and Case were precarious, in part due to his ties to the former Downing Street adviser. One government insider said: “Number 10 are deeply suspicious that he’s not on side.” On Thursday, two officials said there were concerns across Whitehall over Case’s links to Cummings. One government insider said “the mood in the cabinet secretary’s camp is very low” following the hearing. Another added that “he [Case] is clearly worried about what Dom might say next”. But one senior Number 10 official said they “absolutely did not recognise that characterisation”, adding “the cabinet secretary and the prime minister have an excellent working relationship”. More from Kwasi Kwarteng’s morning broadcast round here, as he said care home residents were sufficiently protected. The UK business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, has defended Matt Hancock against criticism that he failed to protect people in care homes at the outset of the Covid pandemic, saying residents “were protected as far as we could”. The health secretary is under mounting pressure after Dominic Cummings accused him of promising ministers that all care residents in England were tested before being discharged back to their homes and then lying about this. On Thursday, Hancock denied the allegation but his explanation that it “wasn’t possible” to test all care home residents before they were discharged from hospital last March because the testing capacity was not yet available, has been called into question. Kwarteng said it was “very easy with hindsight” to say where things could have been improved. “I completely understand the anger and frustration about care homes, because a large number of people died, and it was a terrible situation,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “I think what Mr Hancock said was very clear. He’s always maintained that he wanted to build up the testing capacity. I think he was largely successful in that.” In Northern Ireland, new Ulster Unionist party (UUP) leader Doug Beattie has called for disillusioned Democratic Unionist party (DUP) members to join his party amid a potential schism after Edwin Poots was confirmed as its new leader. Beattie said they had an “awful lot to offer as politicians” and he would welcome them if they decided to defect. He added that no MLAs had approached him, according to PA Media, but conversations had been had with a few individuals. It comes as Poots was confirmed as the DUP’s new leader on Thursday, after Arlene Foster was ousted earlier this year. One member told the BBC that the meeting where Poots was ratified was the worst he had attended in 40 years as a member. Several leading DUP politicians left after the vote, before Poots made his speech. Beattie said: “Our door is always open to people who want to come to the Ulster Unionist Party, but if they want to do so they come understanding the Ulster Unionist Party values and I will talk to them and anyone who wants to come to make sure they understand that before I offer them the ability to join. “If we bring anyone in, and we are a welcoming party, it must be going in our direction, seeing Northern Ireland through our eyes.” Surgical hubs should be created across England and the government should spend £1bn annually for the next five years to reduce the “colossal” backlog in non-urgent procedures, the Royal College of Surgeons has said. The recommendations are two of a dozen suggestions made by the RCS designed to ensure planned surgery can continue safely if the country is hit again by another wave of coronavirus, a new variant or a severe winter/flu outbreak. All elective or planned surgery, such as for knee and hip replacements, was cancelled in the first wave of the pandemic. The latest figures show that in March, 4.95 million people were waiting for hospital treatment in England – the largest figure on record – including 436,127 people waiting more than a year a year. Away from Covid, ex-MP George Galloway announced yesterday that he is set to run in the Batley and Spen byelection on 1 July. Galloway, whose party All For Unity got 0.9% of the vote in the recent Scottish parliament elections, said he was standing in protest against Labour leader Keir Starmer. Labour has selected Kim Leadbeater, the sister of Jo Cox who was MP for the seat when she was murdered in 2016, as it hopes to avoid a repeat of their defeat in Hartlepool in May. Leeds councillor Ryan Stephenson has been chosen as the Conservative party candidate. Pressure is growing on the government to begin the public inquiry into its handling of the Covid pandemic, days after the prime minister’s former top adviser Dominic Cummings said any delay was “completely terrible”. Our social affairs correspondent, Robert Booth has more: Boris Johnson is facing a growing clamour to bring forward the start of the coronavirus public inquiry after Dominic Cummings’ allegations triggered a “political pantomime” that disrespects the victims of the pandemic, their relatives said. The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group, which represents thousands of grieving people, called for an urgent start to the inquiry, which is due to begin in spring 2022. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) joined the call, alongside Lord Kerslake, the former head of the civil service under David Cameron, Angela Rayner, the deputy Labour leader, and Ed Davey, the leader of the Liberal Democrats. Welcome to today’s UK coronavirus liveblog, as Boris Johnson faces calls to push back the relaxing of rules on 21 June in England over fears about a third wave from the India variant. Both Independent Sage member Christina Pagel and business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng were cautious when they spoke to breakfast programmes this morning. Pagel told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme this morning: “So far we’ve kind of been crossing our fingers a little bit, Sage and Public Health England both say it’s a more transmissible variant, we know it has some levels of vaccine escape. “So we’re in a situation where, compared to two months ago, we now have a dominant variant, it transmits faster, and our vaccines are less effective against it.” Speaking to Sky News, Kwarteng said the number of cases was a “matter of concern”. He added: “We don’t want to proceed with the roadmap without considering all the information that we have. Today’s the 28th of May. It’s impossible for anyone to know what the situation will be like in a week or two weeks time.” If you have any comments, tips or suggestions - drop me an email to harry.taylor.casual@theguardian.com or via Twitter @HarryTaylr.","charCount":"19095","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/harry-taylor\">Harry Taylor</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2021/may/28/friends-the-one-where-china-censors-its-guest-stars","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-28T14:10:19Z","webTitle":"Friends reunion: the one where China censors its guest stars","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/28/friends-the-one-where-china-censors-its-guest-stars","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/may/28/friends-the-one-where-china-censors-its-guest-stars","fields":{"headline":"Friends reunion: the one where China censors its guest stars","standfirst":"<p>Viewers say scenes featuring Lady Gaga, boyband BTS and Justin Bieber are missing from Chinese version</p>","trailText":"Viewers say scenes featuring Lady Gaga, boyband BTS and Justin Bieber are missing from Chinese version","byline":"Vincent Ni China affairs correspondent","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"57d18a40d8bb46890ea7554ea5006fadea98bd55\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57d18a40d8bb46890ea7554ea5006fadea98bd55/0_16_1313_788/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lisa Kudrow and Lady Gaga sing Smelly Cat in Friends reunion\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lisa Kudrow and Lady Gaga sing Smelly Cat in the Friends reunion – although not for Chinese viewers. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBOmax</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>For many Chinese millennials, the US sitcom Friends was a window to the American way of life.

The crowds were back at Old Trafford for the first time in 617 days and, what’s more, the sun obliged, a distant heat haze rippling over the Manchester skyscrapers.</p> <p><strong>Yorkshire</strong>, who won the toss and chose to bat, took the opportunity to flirt with a record – their lowest ever total at Old Trafford. At 21 for six, and 40 for seven, 51 looked a stretch, with <strong>Lancashire</strong>’s Saqib Mahmood and Tom Bailey in particular bowling searching spells. Bailey’s figures were a parsimonious 14-11-6-3.</p> <p>But Yorkshire had a gem in Harry Duke, the 19-year old wicketkeeper playing in only his second first-class match, and who had collected a golden duck in his one previous innings. From nervous bolter walking out at 21 for 5, he found his mojo and, full of youthful vim, stroked the ball simply and through the covers. He and Steven Patterson, all elbows and knees, put on 77 for the 10th wicket before Ben Coad and Duanne Olivier thrashed about to take the total over 150.</p> <p>Alex Davies then teed off from the start, reaching his 50 to a happy crescendo of applause before tickling Olivier behind for 52. Jennings and Wells played out till the close, with just under 2,000 people watching Dom Bess twirling in from the Brian Statham End and revelling in Lancashire’s day.</p> <p>Sixteen wickets fell at The Riverside as both <strong>Essex</strong> and <strong>Durham</strong> suffered batting malfunctions. First, Essex lost five wickets for three runs after Michael Pepper was out for 92, as Durham hoovered up their tail. Durham, in turn, collapsed to 58 for six post-tea, five of them lbw.</p> <p><strong>Northamptonshire</strong>’s Ben Sanderson filched five wickets at Hove for the third time in the past four innings, though it could not prevent a <strong>Sussex</strong> fightback. They had been in deep trouble at 67 for eight, before Jack Carson and Henry Crocombe tickled 99 for the ninth wicket. Facing 175, Northants then lost four wickets by the close.</p> <p>Three wickets for <strong>Leicestershire</strong>’s Callum Parkinson, including two in two balls, failed to pin <strong>Middlesex</strong> down as a seventh-wicket stand of 90 between John Simpson and Luke Hollman took them to respectability at stumps.</p> <p>A steady day at Edgbaston, led by 91 from <strong>Warwickshire</strong>’s Will Rhodes at the top of the order, was hijacked by Dane Paterson who snatched three wickets for <strong>Nottinghamshire</strong> in evening sunshine; while the England Under-19 batsman Jack Haynes hit a career best 97 for <strong>Worcestershire</strong> against <strong>Derbyshire</strong> at New Road before being caught on the boundary.

A hug with Luke Wells, a two-step of delight, and off with his helmet as he raises his bat to the dressing-room and all round the ground to the crowd, many on their feet. Hi first first-class hundred since he made 146 not out for England v Sri Lanka in November 2018. A nice little story on Moeen Ali playing in the Birmingham League on Saturday. The England management have agreed he can play for West Bromwich Dartmouth against Walsall in Premier Division One. He’ll be joined by his brother, Omar, his cousin, the former England swing bowler, Kabir, and another cousin, Ismail Mohammed, who is on the staff at Worcestershire And with a six off a no ball, a Bess high, high, full toss, Luke Wells reaches his first fifty for Lancashire. Wi\\th Lancs 214-1, Yorkshire take the new ball. They’ve been asking for a new one all day. Now let’s see if they can do owt with this one. Northants are all out for 256, Sanderson and Berg uoompa loompaing 51 for the last wicket. A prickly lead over Sussex of 81. Four wickets for the promising Garton, two to the equally promising Crocombe. UPDATE “We’ve just had the first “gerronwithit” from the Edgbaston crowd in 18 months (not sure why they had a Nottinghamshire accent.)” Andersson picks up three quick wickets, 3-6 to be exact, at Grace Road, as Leicestershire stumble and fall face down in a puddle. 48-6, trail Middlesex by 247. Will it be curtains tonight at CLS? Essex 68-5, though disappointingly Walter and Pepper were both caught. The Essex lead 155. Keaton reverse-sweeps Bess for four. Easy as pie. Just saying whispering that... if KJ were to reach three figures, it would be for the first time in first-class cricket since November 2018 when he scored 146 for England against Sri Lanka. Off for rain at Edgbaston too. When I walked round the ground at lunch and heard someone in the nets, my first thought was: I bet that’s Has. Old habits, etc. Hameed watch: Hello Tanya at Old Trafford, Ali Martin at Edgbaston here. In between penning a Test series preview for the Observer and a big interview with Tim Southee for Monday’s paper - and before taking my eldest to All Stars cricket later - I’ve been watching Haseeb Hameed bat ahead of his return to the England fold. Some wonderful tail-end swish from Oliver Hannon-Dalby and Liam Norwell (the former giving it both barrels) took Warwickshire to 341 and set up a tricky period of play before lunch for the Nottinghamshire openers. Hameed and Ben Slater survived and have now resumed after vittles (fish and chips in the press box). Hameed, he of the recent England call-up, has taken one blow to the hand from Norwell - a slightly worrying feature of his game - but otherwise the pair have held firm with Notts 28 for none. Rain at Worcestershire. Pepper and Walter have doubled the score, and more, at The Riverside - Essex 38-3. Amla moving inevitably towards 150 at The Oval; and Northants have a lead of 38 with one wicket left at Hove. Celebrity fan. A lap of the ground and back in time to see Keaton Jennings unleash his inner David Gower. I can tell you that it costs £5 for a pint of ice-cold Fosters, which seems on the extortionate side, but what do I know of matters beer. Lots of members warming up in the OT Cafe Nero, others milling round the Members’ Representative desk outside the pavilion. A murmur, a content murmur. Essex?!?!?! Alastair Cook gone for single figures for the second time in the match. Browne and Westley fell either side. Two more lbws to make it 14 in the match, and the last 18 wickets have been lost for 117 runs. Time for lunch and a stretch. Back in 40. mins. Group One Riverside: Durham 99 all out v Essex 182 all out and 15-3!!!! Edgbaston: Warwickshire 341 all out v Nottinghamshire 6-0 New Road: Worcestershire 421 all out v Derbyshire Group Two Grace Road: Leicestershire 21-3 v Middlesex 295 all out The Oval: Surrey 363-7 v Gloucestershire Group Three Old Trafford: Lancashire 150-1 v Yorkshire 159 all out Hove: Sussex 175 all out v Northants 195-8 Lunch! Scores to follow. Drizzle in the Manchester air so the covers come on. Thanks to Hoppsy for tweeting this - and to point out that these figures do not include the scholarship kids like Joe and Billy Root and Haseeb Hameed. And a thoughtful email from Nat Goodden on a similar theme. “This is left over from last week – I e’d you a few minutes after you’d (very reasonably) logged off. Whitchurch High School – someone had e’d you about its interesting (I’d say amazing) record for producing sporting stars – mentioning Gareth Bale, but without adding both Geraint Thomas (Tour de France winner, also a second place, yes?) and Sam Warburton (Wales and Lions rugby captain). All within 2 or 3 years, I believe. And it’s a proper STATE school! Re Durham LBW’s yesterday – even more extraordinary seems the total number of LBW’s given, Essex ones included – 11 in all by my count. Now is that a record, or what?” In my book all state schools should have a proper playing field, even if that means requisitioning land from next door office buildings or building new schools elsewhere. Even if pupils hate sport they can benefit from sitting in a green environment at lunchtime with all the benefits we know that brings. I defy you to listen to this and not have a little cry. Ed Barnard’s 2021 season is run-heavy - I’ve just clocked he’s 86 not out, with Dillan Pennington hanging on in there, 22 not out, in an attempts to get him over the line. Worcestershire 417-9. Through the covers Keaton, head over knee, arcing bat. A hundred and seventy-seven balls of dedication - and 28 of the 53 came in seven fours. Northants inch into the lead at Hove, as Saif Zaib passes 50 for the third time in his last 4 innings. Nice little fight back from 107-5. Not the best of starts at Grace Road, where Leicestershire are 2-1. Hassan Azad gone for a duck to Ethan Bamber in what is proving to be rather an unkind season. averaging 31, compared to 54 in 2019. Much to Gloucestershire’s irritation, Hashim Amla and Sean Abbott have now put on 53 for the seventh wicket, with Amla on a 250-ball 121 not out. Jennings awakes from his slumbers to crack Patterson for four - three more runs and he’ll have his fourth fifty in five innings. Lancs 136-1. Time to change the sheets. Durham all out 99. Essex lead by 83 runs, which is more than generous. Middlesex 295 all out, John Simpson left high and dry on 95. Yorkshire try to change the ball in desperation, but the umpires tell them to hurry along. Durham are down and nearly out at 99-9 against Essex; Harmer hasn’t even had a bowl yet. Luke Fletcher has grabbed his first wicket of the day at Edgbaston, swiftly followed by Paterson snatching his fifth as Danny Lamb is caught for 67. Warwicks 293-9 Yorkshire are giving Bess a go from the Brian Statham end, Long sleeves, baggy trousers that could do with a hitch, he has a endearingly scruffy air, most unlike his opponent Mister wax and polish Jennings. He dries, dries, dries the ball again on his shirt. Lancashire have scored 19 runs in 45 minutes. Proper Roses. A pocket of early morning wickets: Ned Eckersley (a sixth lbw) and Brydon Carse at The Riverside, Durham 79-8; Danny Briggs at Edgbaston, as Paterson continues where he left off yesterday, Warwicks 270-7; Tom Helm at Grace Road, Middx 279-8; and in the umbrella-biter at Hove,Simon Kerrigan has been bowled by George Garton, Northants 121-5. And lo, Keaton Jennings pulls Olivier across the verdant grass and into the boundary boards, with a crack of the bat and to a crescendo of local applause. An email. Good Morning Brian. “Morning Tanya The Durham commentator tells us that yesterday was the only time that Durham have lost their first five wickets lbw. (Judging by the way they were offering their pads so freely I had half-suspected they were on some sort of ‘charity sponsorship’, if that’s the acceptable euphemism for spot fixing.) More generally, I’m wondering who holds the (presumably unwanted) county record for most consecutive lbw dismissals?” This is definitely one for BTL. A tickle brings a trudge: Jamie Overton slopes back over The Oval rope, out to the first ball of the day. Surrey 285-6. A couple of overs under the belt at Old Trafford, not much to report apart from some deliciously sticky biscotti and a discussion about how much more together Keaton Jennings looks this season. Group One Riverside: Durham 58-6 v Essex 182 all out Edgbaston: Warwickshire 250-6 v Nottinghamshire New Road: Worcestershire 336-7 v Derbyshire Group Two Grace Road: Leicestershire v Middlesex 260-7 The Oval: Surrey 285-5 v Gloucestershire Group Three Old Trafford: Lancashire 95-1 v Yorkshire 159 all out Hove: Sussex 175 all out v Northants 91-4 The swifts darted over the tram lines for the 221st Roses Championship match, and in the car park a man carefully folded his jacket over his arm and picked up his picnic bag. The crowds were back at Old Trafford for the first time in 617 days and, what’s more, the sun obliged, a distant heat haze rippling over the Manchester skyscrapers. Yorkshire, who won the toss and chose to bat, took the opportunity to flirt with a record – their lowest ever total at Old Trafford. At 21 for six, and 40 for seven, 51 looked a stretch, with Lancashire’s Saqib Mahmood and Tom Bailey in particular bowling searching spells. Bailey’s figures were a parsimonious 14-11-6-3. But Yorkshire had a gem in Harry Duke, the 19-year old wicketkeeper playing in only his second first-class match, and who had collected a golden duck in his one previous innings. From nervous bolter walking out at 21 for 5, he found his mojo and, full of youthful vim, stroked the ball simply and through the covers. He and Steven Patterson, all elbows and knees, put on 77 for the 10th wicket before Ben Coad and Duanne Olivier thrashed about to take the total over 150. Alex Davies then teed off from the start, reaching his 50 to a happy crescendo of applause before tickling Olivier behind for 52. Jennings and Wells played out till the close, with just under 2,000 people watching Dom Bess twirling in from the Brian Statham End and revelling in Lancashire’s day. Sixteen wickets fell at The Riverside as both Essex and Durham suffered batting malfunctions. First, Essex lost five wickets for three runs after Michael Pepper was out for 92, as Durham hoovered up their tail. Durham, in turn, collapsed to 58 for six post-tea, five of them lbw. Northamptonshire’s Ben Sanderson filched five wickets at Hove for the third time in the past four innings, though it could not prevent a Sussex fightback. They had been in deep trouble at 67 for eight, before Jack Carson and Henry Crocombe tickled 99 for the ninth wicket. Facing 175, Northants then lost four wickets by the close. Three wickets for Leicestershire’s Callum Parkinson, including two in two balls, failed to pin Middlesex down as a seventh-wicket stand of 90 between John Simpson and Luke Hollman took them to respectability at stumps. A steady day at Edgbaston, led by 91 from Warwickshire’s Will Rhodes at the top of the order, was hijacked by Dane Paterson who snatched three wickets for Nottinghamshire in evening sunshine; while the England Under-19 batsman Jack Haynes hit a career best 97 for Worcestershire against Derbyshire at New Road before being caught on the boundary. Hashim Amla, leading Surrey for the first time, made an unbeaten century against Gloucestershire, and received a standing ovation from the Oval crowd. It’s day two and there’s a dampness to the air. Paul Allott is walking gingerly over the outfield in his hush puppies, while over on the white rose side of the ground, Yorkshire are playing touch rugby. Adam Lyth is resplendent in knee high white socks, not a sign of surrender of course.","charCount":"11849","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/tanyaaldred\">Tanya Aldred</a> at Old Trafford"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/live/2021/may/28/markets-rally-biden-6tn-budget-proposal-eurozone-confidence-core-inflation-markets-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-28T14:10:06Z","webTitle":"US inflation gauge highest since 1992;

The budget deficit is expected to hit $1.8tn in 2022.</p> <p><strong>But the documents will also be aspirational.</strong> Biden’s Democrats hold only narrow majorities in the House and Senate, and the Republicans are pushing for a smaller infrastructure package instead.

Stocks have opened higher, with reports that Joe Biden will propose $6tn of federal spending next year in his first budget still providing support. Dow: up 104 points or 0.3% at 34,568 points S&amp;P 500: up 12 points or 0.3% at 4,212 points Nasdaq Composite: up 71 points or 0.5% at 13,807 points Fiona Cincotta, senior financial markets analyst at City Index, says the Federal Reserve is expected to view the jump in PCE prices as temporary, rather than being spurred to raise interest rates. Core PCE, the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, jumped to 3.1% YoY in April, up from 1.8% in March and ahead of the 2.9% forecast. The futures were already trading higher ahead of the release and barely reacted to the high inflation numbers. Fed officials have been consistently reassuring the market that they are willing to look through a period of high inflation, which they consider to be temporary. This was particularly the case after CPI hit a 13 year high of 4.2%. This strong rise in PCE inflation could make it more difficult for the Fed to defend its dovish policy, but for now the market doesn’t appear concerned. High growth tech stocks which are usually dragged lower by fears of the Fed moving early have held onto gains. The US Dollar also remains elevated. Supply bottlenecks helped to drive up prices last month, points out Grant Thornton’s chief economist Diane Swonk. She adds that stimulus support is playing a vital role in keeping the economy rising. While US inflation picked up sharply in April, personal incomes fell by just over 13% during the month. That’s followed a 20% surge in March, though, as stimulus checks landed in bank accounts. A key measure of US inflation has hit its highest level since the early 1990s, as price pressures build amid the economic recovery. The core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index increased by 3.1% in April from one year ago, the Commerce Department reports. That’s the highest annual core PCE reading since 1992, and is sharply higher than March’s 1.9% reading. Core PCE is closely watched by the US Federal Reserve as a solid measure of inflation. This surge is higher than expected, and may fuel concerns that the US economy could be overheating as it bounced back strongly from the economic shock of Covid-19. On a monthly basis, core PCE prices rose by 0.7% in April alone - again, a faster rise in inflation than forecast. The broader PCE price index increased 3.6 percent in April from one year ago, “reflecting increases in both goods and services”, the BEA says. That’s up from 2.4% a month ago, and is the highest reading since 2008. Energy prices surged by 24.8% year-on-year while food prices increased 0.9% over the year. Fed policymakers see the core PCE measure as a good gauge of inflation as they try to deliver their mandate of price stability (around 2% inflation) and full employment. Earlier this month, the consumer price index surged to 4.2% year-on-year in April, although some economists argue that these moves are transitory (and partly driven by base effects), as the economy emerges from the pandemic. British police in the West Midlands had a surprise when they raided a suspected cannabis farm in an industrial estate earlier this month - and discovered an illicit bitcoin mining operation stealing electricity instead. Officers executed a drugs warrant at a Black Country industrial unit, on suspicions that it might be growing cannabis plants. West Midlands Police had heard that lots of people were visiting the unit at different times of day. Plus there was lots of wiring and ventilation ducts were visible, and a police drone picked up a considerable heat source from above -- all classic cannabis factory signs, they say. But once they entered the building, they found around 100 computer units as part of what’s understood to be a Bitcoin mining operation. They’ve now been seized. Sandwell Police Sergeant Jennifer Griffin explained: “It’s certainly not what we were expecting! It had all the hallmarks of a cannabis cultivation set-up and I believe it’s only the second such crypto mine we’ve encountered in the West Midlands. “My understanding is that mining for cryptocurrency is not itself illegal but clearly abstracting electricity from the mains supply to power it is. “We’ve seized the equipment and will be looking into permanently seizing it under the Proceeds of Crime Act. No-one was at the unit at the time of the warrant and no arrests have been made – but we’ll be making enquiries with the unit’s owner.” New bitcoins are created by “mining” coins, which is done by using computers to carry out complex calculations. The more bitcoins there are, the longer it takes to mine new coin, and the more electricity is used in the process. Meanwhile, a new cryptocurrency is being blamed for shortages of hard drives and other storage systems, as speculators buy up critical components in anticipation of a price rise. Chia aims to improve on more popular cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ethereum by removing the incentives to burn massive amounts of electricity -- but instead, it uses huge amounts of hard drive space. Here’s the story: France’s stock market is shrugging off its surprise dip back into recession. The CAC 40 index has gained 0.65% today, slightly outpacing other markets, and helping to keep the wider Stoxx 600 index at a new record (it’s up 0.5% now). Airbus (+2.3%) are the top riser, after yesterday outlining plans to lift aeroplane production over the next few years. Joshua Mahony, senior market analyst at IG, says Joe Biden’s $6tn budget proposal is supporting stocks -- although the White House may struggle to get all the spending plans through Congress. “European markets are on the rise in early trade today, with traders anticipating the announcement of a huge spending plan from Joe Biden today. Plans for a $6 trillion budget will bring many winners, although it makes sense to take any of today’s announcements with a pinch of salt. “Despite Biden enjoying a slim majority across congress, the ability to get his original plan across the line is doubtful. Thus while markets will likely enjoy an optimistic end to the week, it could be just a matter of time before we see a heavy dose of reality over just how much of that $6 trillion will see the light of day. And on France’s recession, he says restrictions hit growth (such as a nationwide nightly curfew in place since mid-December, and hospitality closures which eased this month): “A surprise downward revision to the French first quarter GDP highlighted how the country dipped into recession under the weight of coronavirus restrictions. “The stuttering EU Covid vaccination programme provided a brief period of lag for many mainland European nations, but a ramp-up in efforts should ensure the region has a strong enough level of protection to remove all restrictions in the coming months. France, the euro zone’s second biggest economy, has unexpectedly fallen back into recession. New GDP data released this morning showed that French GDP shrank by 0.1% in January-March, rather than the 0.4% growth that was first reported. That follows a 1.5% contraction in the last three months of 2020, meaning France has joined the wider eurozone in recession as the Covid-19 pandemic hit the region’s economy. It means France’s economy is 4.7% smaller than in the fourth quarter of 2019, before the pandemic. Statistics body INSEE cuts its GDP estimate after finding that France’s construction output was much weaker than early data had shown. It also reports that real disposable income of households fell by 1.0% in the first quarter while the savings rate dipped to 21.8% from a revised 22.7% at the end of 2020. The downgrade is a blow to president Macron, who had resisted pressure from health experts to announce new lockdown measures until mid-March, when surging infections and hospitalisations forced the government to impose restrictions in Paris and parts of Northern France. A country-wide lockdown was announced at the end of March, in an attempt to curb a dramatic surge in Covid-19 cases that threatened to overwhelm hospitals. Those closures of non-essential shops and schools, and restrictions on travel (along with ongoing hospitality closures) have now hit the economy. INSEE reports that household spending - a key driver of growth - fell by 8.3% in April. France’s lockdown is now being eased, and the government is hopeful of recovery this year, as Reuters explains: COVID-19 restrictions are now being unwound in France. Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire on Thursday stuck to his growth forecast of 5% for 2021 and said the crisis was “moving behind us, though we must remain cautious”. The wider eurozone shrank by 0.6% in the first quarter of the year, according to preliminary data, while Germany contracted by 1.8%. Alex Kuptsikevich, FxPro senior financial analyst, flags up that inflation pressures are rising, alongside the jump in consumer confidence. The Eurozone consumer confidence index confirmed at -5.1 in May. This is the highest level since the end of 2018 and is amongst the top 20% of all-time highs since 1985. Against this background, it is not surprising to see new highs in the European stock indices. Inflation expectations are contributing to this push upwards in indices sentiment, as this is seen as a positive factor, suggesting that people will spend more soon. However, investors and households are worried that inflation may eat into income levels, as the driver of price increases in commodity prices rather than wage and service growth. Earlier today, German Destatis noted a double-digit inflation rate in import prices for the first time since 2010. Besides the low base effect, we note a 6.6% price increase since the start of the year, so it looks like a further stage of inflation. The long-running problem of loyal customers being charged more than new ones should finally be over. The UK’s financial watchdog has stamped down on the ‘loyalty penalty’; from next January, car and home insurance renewal quotes may not be more expensive than those offered to new customers. This will prevent customers who stick with their insurer being quietly squeezed, but might also mean fewer cut-price deals aimed at those who shop around. Our Money editor Hilary Osborne explains: Customers who renew their home or motor insurance will not be charged more than new policyholders after the financial watchdog put an end to companies charging a loyalty penalty. People who automatically renew their policy with their insurer are often charged higher premiums than new customers, who tend to be offered the best deals. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) found that on average new customers paid £285 a year for motor insurance, while customers who had been with their provider for more than five years were charged £370. In the home insurance market, new customers paid £165 a year for buildings and contents cover, while after five years, premiums had increased to £287. It said its ban on the practice of price walking, where insurance premiums go up as a matter of course year on year rather than because the risk is higher, would save consumers £4.2bn over 10 years. Here’s the full story: Ian Mason, head of UK financial services regulation at law firm Gowling WLG, has welcomed the move: “This is a welcome move by the FCA to protect consumers, so that existing customers are offered the same deals when renewing their insurance as new customers. The FCA is increasingly focusing on firms providing fair outcomes for consumers, and this is in line with that trend”. Twitter has listed a new paid-for “Twitter Blue” service on app stores, suggesting the social media company may launch its long-rumoured subscription service soon. Mobile phone app stores showed the service, although its expected features did not yet appear to be available. A subscription plan has long been expected as Twitter looks for more ways to make money from its large user base. In April, the company said it had 199 million users from whom it could make money every day, a 20% year-on-year increase. On Apple’s App Store Twitter lists “Twitter Blue” under in-app purchases for £2.49 in the UK and $2.99 in the US store. On the Android store the Twitter listing shows “in-app purchases” but does not list pricing for the service. The economic confidence report also shows that inflation expectations are building as the European economy pick up. Consumer price expectations increased further in May, for the fifth month in a row, and above the long-term average - showing people are bracing for higher inflation over the coming year. Those concerns seem justified. European businesses said they expect to be lifting their prices over the next 12 months. Selling price expectations among manufacturers, who have been hit by the surge in commodity prices and transports, hit a record. The survey says: Selling price expectations saw the third month of marked and uniform increases across all surveyed business sectors, i.e. industry, services, retail trade and construction, reaching an all-time high in industry. Here’s some reaction to the rise in eurozone economic confidence, from ING’s Bert Colijn... ...and Howard Archer of EY Item Club. Economic confidence across the eurozone has hit a three-year high, as optimism over the recovery from the pandemic rises. It was lifted by a jump in sentiment at service sector firms, retailers and among consumers, as Covid-19 restrictions are eased, new data from from the European Commission shows. The EC’s index of eurozone economic sentiment has jumped to 114.5 points in May from 110.5 in April, higher than expected, and close to its December 2017 peak. It also rose strongly in the wider EU, up 4 points to 113.9. These readings are “markedly above its long-term average and pre-pandemic level”, says the EC, with employment expectations also rising. Optimism in the services sector rose the most, and broke above its long-term average for the first time since March last year - jumping from 2.2 to 11.3 in the euro area. The report explains: Managers expressed more positive views on the past business situation and past demand, and were more optimistic on demand expectations. Consumer confidence increased for the fourth time in a row (+3.0), driven by an improvement in all its components (i.e. views on their household’s past and future financial situation, their expectations of the general economic situation in their country, and their intentions to make major purchases). Industry confidence increased for the sixth month in a row, with managers reporting strong order books and improved export demand. Retail trade confidence rose for the third time in a row (+2.8), and construction confidence improved (+1.9), as managers reported improved order books and more optimistic employment expectations. Back on Joe Biden’s budget proposal...CNBC say the president is proposing $5tn in new federal spending over the next 10 years. President Joe Biden will propose $5 trillion in new federal spending over the next decade on Friday, part of his fiscal year 2022 budget request, a source familiar with the proposal tells CNBC. The new spending would be paid for in part by $3.6 trillion in additional revenues over the same period. The result would be a net deficit of $1.4 trillion, which would begin shrinking after 2030. Biden will include $300 billion of the $5 trillion total in his budget request to Congress for fiscal year 2022. This will bring the president’s total budget request for next year to $6 trillion, the source said. European stocks have hit a new all-time high, as optimism over the economic recovery continues to lift share prices across the region. The Europe-wide Stoxx 600 index has gained 0.45% this morning to 448.45 points, a fresh record. Every sector is higher, led by financials, industrial stocks and utilities. The Stoxx 600 has now gained over 12% so far this year, amid optimism that Europe’s economy will rebound strongly from the pandemic - now that Covid-19 vaccination programs have picked up speed. Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC are both up around 0.4%. Recent European economic data has shown activity is picking up strongly, with business growth hitting a three-year high this month and the EC upgrading its own growth forecasts. America’s strong recovery, and president Biden’s spending plans, are also providing a lift. Frédérique Carrier, Head of Investment Strategy, RBC Wealth Management, says the European economy is reviving faster than most observers expected. Europe, where many countries had to extend lockdown measures, is finally emerging from a long economic winter thanks to lower infection rates and an accelerating vaccine rollout. Carrier has upgraded her view on European equities to ‘overweight’, predicting they will see a ‘conducive climate’ over the next six to 12 months. She writes: As macroeconomic momentum builds, earnings delivery is strong and both management and consensus forecasts are being revised upwards. The Q1 reporting season was exceptionally robust, with companies in the Euro STOXX Index, an index of some 300 European companies, easily beating consensus expectations and generating earnings per share growth of close to 40 percent year over year, driven by sales increases and margin expansion. Moreover, management teams overall were optimistic on a demand recovery, though some noted concerns regarding supply shortages. Most were confident of their pricing power and ability to reduce costs. Following a heady Q1, upgraded forecasts suggest the earnings recovery is likely to last into next year. The consensus is looking for earnings growth of around 15 percent year over year for 2022. In the City, the blue-chip FTSE 100 index has risen 30 points to 7050 points, up 0.45%. Top risers include energy firm SSE (+2.6%), and UK housebuilders Taylor Wimpey (+2.5%), Barratt Development (+2.4%) and Persimmon (+2.1%). Luxury fashion group Burberry (+2.5%), and financial stocks such as HSBC (+2.4%) and Prudential (+2.4%) are also higher this morning. Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor, says the prospect of higher inflation is pushing the market up. “Further signs that the US economy is beginning to run hot prompted another switch into value stocks, at the expense of growth. The renewed consideration of cyclical stocks as an investment destination has generally played into the hands of the FTSE100, which has now risen by 9% in the year to date. The index is replete with sectors falling into the recovery category, such as the banks, oils and miners. For the likes of the airlines and the hospitality sectors, however, the outlook remains rather more cloudy as both travel restrictions and the emergence of Covid-19 variants hinder a smooth return to some sort of normality. The US stock market is expected to open higher later today. The Dow Jones industrial average up around 0.5% in pre-market trading, adding to yesterday’s 0.4% gain. Australia’s benchmark stock index, the S&amp;P/ASX 200, has hit a record closing high today, amid renewed optimism in the global economic outlook and the prospect of a $6tn Biden budget. The mining sector was leading the gains with financials, energy, industrials and consumer staples also higher. Higher US spending could mean greater demand for commodities and a wider boost to growth. This lifted the index to its highest close, and near the intraday high hit early in the pandemic. The Australian Financial Review reports: A sharp rally in domestic miners and energy stocks drove the S&amp;P/ASX 200 Index to a fresh closing high of 7179.5, rising 84.6 points, or 1.2 per cent, on Friday amid speculation that US President Joe Biden is planning an infrastructure friendly $6 trillion budget. Shares exceeded their May 10 record of 7172.8 points, but not the intraday high of 7197 set on February 20, 2020. Asian stocks have put global equities on course for a seventh day of gains today as investors bet the U.S. will lead the world out of the COVID-19 pandemic, points out Reuters. While Japan’s Nikkei led the way with a 2.1% jump, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 0.3% earlier today. The MSCI world equity index added 0.1% to 709.71, nearing the all-time closing high of 710.36 set on May 7. However, China’s CSI 300 index dipped by 0.3%. Kyle Rodda of IG explains why president Biden’s budget plans have lifted spirits: Given its sensitivity to swings in the business cycle, commodity prices and global trade, Asia’s financial markets could arguably be said to benefit most from a big spending US fiscal package. As much seemed to manifest in the region’s stock markets today: Asia’s benchmark indices have generally put in solid rallies to end the month – with the notable exception of Chinese stocks, which have traded flat – as markets discount the possibility of another pump-priming of global growth by the US. The export sensitive Nikkei has been the noteworthy outperformer, despite Japan extending its state of emergency today. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Global stock markets are nudging higher as investors brace for president Joe Biden to propose a $6tn spending package when he unveils his first budget later today. Biden is expected to propose record federal spending of $6tn in the 2022 financial year, starting in October, rising to $8.2 trillion by 2031, according to a report in the New York Times. Citing documents it had obtained, the NYT said the Democratic president planned to pay for his agenda through increased taxes on corporations and high earners, with budget deficits expected to decrease in the 2030s. The budget will show how Biden intends to deliver on his sweeping domestic agenda. That includes the American Jobs Plan to build new transport, water, energy and broadband infrastructure, modernise homes, and boost manufacturing, and the American Families Plan to invest more in childcare and education. The budget will also outline how the White House see inflation, employment, and economic growth panning out. The budget deficit is expected to hit $1.8tn in 2022. But the documents will also be aspirational. Biden’s Democrats hold only narrow majorities in the House and Senate, and the Republicans are pushing for a smaller infrastructure package instead. So a pitched battle lies ahead. As Reuters explains: Republicans have criticized the president for seeking trillions in new spending, setting the stage for pitched battles over his priorities. “It just seems like the trillions keep on coming,” Republican U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito, who is leading a group of colleagues pursuing a counteroffer to Biden’s current $1.7 trillion infrastructure proposal. Yesterday, president Biden told an event in Cleveland that it’s the right time to invest in the economic recovery: “Now is the time to build (upon) the foundation that we’ve laid to make bold investments in our families and our communities and our nation. We know from history that these kinds of investments raise both the floor and the ceiling over the economy for everybody.” Hailing the recent progress against Covid-19, Biden added: “We’ve turned the tide on the once-in-a-century pandemic. “And now we’re faced with a question: what kind of economy are we going to build for tomorrow? What are we going to do? I believe this is our moment to rebuild an economy from the bottom up and the middle out.” Asia-Pacific equity markets have been boosted overnight, with Japan’s Nikkei jumping 2.1% and South Korea’s Kospi gaining 0.8%. Investors anticipate that this surge in US spending will feed through to the global economy, as Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at OANDA, explains: President Biden’s Preliminary Budget is envisaging a $1.8 trillion deficit next year, after tax rises. Of course, what the President would like, and what he will get from Congress could be quite different, but with that level of spending, Asia appears to feel that some of that goody bag will fall their way, and Asian equity markets have risen today Strong economic data yesterday is also supporting stocks, with the number of new US jobless claims falling to a pandemic low yesterday, and US growth confirmed at a pacy 1.6% in the last quarter (while the UK and eurozone contracted). Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote, says: A robust GDP growth in the first quarter, a fresh pandemic low print in weekly jobless claims and the talk of a $6 trillion federal spending package for the coming fiscal year boosted appetite in most equities and the US dollar. But could inflation fears spoil the party again? Later today we get the latest ‘core PCE price’ index -- the US Federal Reserve’s preferred gauge of inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices. It’s expected to jump to 2.9% on a yearly basis from 1.8%. The University of Michigan’s final consumer morale index for May is likely to highlight that inflation worries are hitting confidence (as the preliminary report showed earlier this month).

But a fourth wave has prompted the government to put emergency measures in place in 10 regions including the capital.</p> <p>The measures mostly limit the sale of alcohol in bars and restaurants and ask them to close early, while encouraging telework and capping audience numbers at events.</p> <p>“The number of new cases has been declining since the middle of the month but the situation continues to be uncertain,” said prime minister <strong>Yoshihide Suga</strong>, announcing the extension.</p> <p>Tokyo 2020 chief<strong> Seiko Hashimoto</strong> told reporters that with the measures being taken “we expect the infection situation to improve.” But she acknowledged that a decision on local fans, originally expected in early June, would now not be taken until the end of the month.</p> <p>“Once the state of emergency is lifted, we will assess how many spectators we can allow in,” she said, adding that there could be different rules for indoor and outdoor venues and the decision would be based on government guidelines.</p> <p>Even under the current state of emergency, sports venues in Japan are allowed to seat 5,000 spectators or 50 percent capacity, whichever is smallest.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"990cc60666b92a70abf196b686c07d3aba18d613\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/990cc60666b92a70abf196b686c07d3aba18d613/0_61_2806_1682/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga speaks during the government task force meeting for the COVID-19 measures at his official residence in Tokyo on 28 May.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga speaks during the government task force meeting for the COVID-19 measures at his official residence in Tokyo on 28 May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yoshitaka Sugawara/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60b0c3b98f088d8c3178bbf3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-05-28T10:28:48.589Z\">11.28am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As pharmaceutical companies face growing pressure to waive patents to allow Covid vaccines to be manufactured quicker to allow more even distribution around the globe, <strong>Russia</strong> has provided an interesting model on what to do if you would like a certain medicine to be available in your country.</p> <p>Late last year, the Russian government granted Russian drugmaker <strong>Pharmasyntez</strong> a compulsory licence for one year to manufacture the anti-Covid-19 drug <strong>remdesivir</strong> under a different name without creator <strong>Gilead Science</strong>’s permission.</p> <p>Pharmasyntez had asked the <strong>Kremlin</strong> to allow it to produce a generic version of remdesivir before the decree was issued. Now, Russia’s supreme court has rejected a lawsuit from the <strong>US</strong> company that challenged the Russian government decision to let the firm develop and market the drug without their consent.</p> <p>Reuters reports that the government said in a decree at the time that the move was in the interests of Russia’s own security. According to the decree, Russia had to pay compensation to the drug’s patent-holder. The amount was not specified.<br></p> <p><strong>Vikram Punia</strong>, its director, said the company had also written to Gilead in July last year to try to obtain their consent in the form of a voluntary licence, but had not heard back. Pharmasyntez produces remdesivir under the name <strong>Remdeform</strong>. A shipment of the drug was sent by Russia to India on Tuesday as part of a delivery of humanitarian aid.</p> <p>Gilead said in a statement it was disappointed by the ruling and called the issuance of a compulsory licence “unnecessary and counterproductive ... We have stood ready to work with Russia to expand access to Veklury [remdesevir] since [the] mid-2020. Intellectual property is not, and has never been, a significant barrier to access to medicines in Russia.”</p> <p>Its Mattha Busby here taking over the blog from my colleague Martin Belam.

With many more vaccinations starting to arrive from the various manufacturers, the government is looking to ramp up its inoculation campaign with the aim of covering the entire adult population by September. Figliuolo said vaccinations might soon be opened up to some 2.3 million Italians aged between 12 and 15 if the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and Italian regulators give the green light. The EMA is expected to approve shots for youngsters later today. “We are ready to vaccinate them,” Figliuolo said. World Health Organization (WHO) experts are preparing a proposal on the next studies to be carried out into the origins of the virus that causes Covid-19, a spokeswoman has said. The US called yesterday for the WHO to carry out a second phase of its investigation into the origins, with independent experts given full access to original data and samples in China. The UK made a similar appeal. WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib told a UN briefing today that experts would prepare a proposal for WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, but that there was no set timeline. Earlier this week WHO’s top emergency expert Mike Ryan said that talks with member states would continue in coming weeks. Illustrating the potential dangers of social media regulation of news content, due to its u-turn, Facebook yesterday lifted a ban on posts claiming Covid-19 was man-made after the Wall Street Journal reported that three staff members at the Wuhan Institute for Virology sought hospital treatment for flu-like symptoms in November 2019.. It comes after Adhanom Ghebreyesus in February almost immediately undermined the dismissal by a WHO team that visited Wuhan to investigate the origins of the pandemic of the lab leak theory. The original mission oversaw tens of thousands of tests on animals which did not make any suggestion there was a natural cause to the virus. Prince Charles has suggested that people struggling to return to full health after having the coronavirus should practise yoga. In a video statement to the virtual yoga and healthcare symposium Wellness After Covid, the heir apparent said doctors should work together with “complementary healthcare specialists” to “build a roadmap to hope and healing” after Covid. This pandemic has emphasised the importance of preparedness, resilience and the need for an approach which addresses the health and welfare of the whole person as part of society, and which does not merely focus on the symptoms alone. As part of that approach, therapeutic, evidenced-informed yoga can contribute to health and healing. By its very nature, yoga is an accessible practice which provides practitioners with ways to manage stress, build resilience and promote healing.” The prince said those attending the symposium shared an ambition “to help those for whom the mental anguish and physical challenges of long Covid have been devastating”. He added: “When we work together with a common interest we can build on each other’s ideas and, perhaps, build a roadmap to hope and healing.” Speaking to attendees at the event co-organised by the Yoga In Healthcare Alliance and the Give Back Yoga university, the Prince of Wales also acknowledged his own brush with Covid in March last year, saying: “I seem to have got away with it quite lightly … unfortunately, that is not the case for millions of people in the UK and across the globe.” Travelers coming from Nordic countries will no longer have to show a negative Covid test to enter Sweden from next week, the minister for the interior has said. “We have decided to go ahead with the Nordics first, it’s a priority for us,” the minister, Mikael Damberg, said. Travelers from other countries within the EU will still have to show a negative test until 30 June, Reuters reports. Travelers from outside the EU are still banned. Thirty-two members of parliament in the Democratic Republic of Congo, or about 5% of the total, have died from Covid-19 since the start of the pandemic, the vice-president of the national assembly said. Reuters has the story: Even as Congo, like many other African countries, has officially reported relatively few cases and deaths, the virus has rippled through the corridors of power, killing prominent lawmakers and members of the president’s entourage. “The latest update announced by the government reports 31,248 confirmed cases and 780 deaths, among them 32 members of parliament,” said Jean-Marc Kabund, the first vice president of the lower house of parliament. In December, lawmakers and others in the parliament building flung chairs and buckets at one another during a brawl caused by a rift between president Felix Tshisekedi and his predecessor, Joseph Kabila. Most wore their masks below their chins. Tshisekedi raised eyebrows earlier this month when, during a dinner with supporters in the southeastern city of Kolwezi, he noted jokingly that attendees were violating a curfew imposed in response to the pandemic and said, “Today, you have permission.” Congo’s vaccination campaign has stuttered after it delayed the rollout because of safety concerns about the AstraZeneca shot. As a result, around 75% of the 1.7 million doses it received in March were reallocated the following month to make sure they were used before they expired. Indian authorities have announced a tentative easing of the lockdown in the capital Delhi as coronavirus infections fall in major cities after weeks of restrictions. AFP reports: Rural areas of the country are now seeing the brunt of a surge in cases that has overwhelmed the health care system and killed at least 160,000 people since the start of March. Arvind Kejriwal, Delhi’s chief minister, said that from Monday construction work and factories can resume, “keeping the poorest section of our society, the labourers and daily wage workers, in mind”. “We are starting the process of reopening very, very slowly. We will reassess it after a week based on experts and people’s opinions,” he said. Daily infections reported across India have more than halved from more than 400,000 earlier this month, according to official statistics. Deaths per day have also fallen but by much less, with 3,660 reported on Friday in the previous 24 hours. This is widely seen as a major underestimate. Delhi reported about 1,100 new infections today, down from about 25,000 daily cases when the lockdown was announced six weeks earlier. Even as he announced reopening from Monday, Kejriwal urged people of Delhi to “not step out of your homes unnecessarily”. He said: “This is a very sensitive time and we have to function with full responsibility so that we can together save our Delhi and our country.” A single-shot coronavirus vaccine from Johnson &amp; Johnson has been approved for use in the UK. PA Media reports: The vaccine, developed by Johnson &amp; Johnson’s pharmaceutical arm Janssen, has been shown to be 67% effective overall at preventing moderate to severe Covid-19, with studies suggesting it also offers complete protection from admission to hospital and death. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, welcomed the news. He said: “This is a further boost to the UK’s hugely successful vaccination programme, which has already saved over 13,000 lives, and means that we now have four safe and effective vaccines approved to help protect people from this awful virus. “As Janssen is a single-dose vaccine, it will play an important role in the months to come as we redouble our efforts to encourage everyone to get their jabs and potentially begin a booster programme later this year.” The Danish government has presented its digital coronavirus passport enabling people to travel abroad or, in Denmark, go to the hairdresser, a tattoo parlour, dine inside a restaurant or wherever else it is needed. “The corona passport we present today can be used from 1 July when you can travel within the EU,” said finance minister Nicolai Vammen. AP has the story: Some 20% of Denmark’s population of 6 million have been fully vaccinated, according to the latest figures, he said. During a press conference outside the Copenhagen airport, health minister Magnus Heunicke held up his phone to show the app, which only features a QR code and a green bar if the person has been vaccinated twice or recently tested negative for Covid-19. “What we get now is an app that makes it easier and simpler to use,” Heunicke said. “There is no doubt that we will have to use it over the summer, but it is of course something that needs to be phased out.” People will either have the code scanned or will flash it before entering an airport, a harbor, a train station, a hairdresser or an eatery. In certain cases, a physical document can be sent in the mail to serve the same purpose as the app. However, there have been warnings from across Europe that vaccine certificates could create a form of “medical apartheid”. Last month, more than 1,200 church leaders in the UK said in a letter they are an “unethical form of coercion” and would strengthen the “surveillance state”. This scheme has the potential to bring about the end of liberal democracy as we know it and to create a surveillance state in which the government uses technology to control certain aspects of citizens’ lives. As such, this constitutes one of the most dangerous policy proposals ever to be made in the history of British politics. Holland’s first choice goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen has tested positive for coronavirus and will not travel with the team for a week-long European Championship training camp in Portugal. The Valencia keeper will miss the preparations on the Algarve, which include a friendly international against Scotland on Wednesday. “The medical staff of the Dutch team are monitoring his condition closely and as soon as it is medical responsible, he will be drafted back into the squad,” a statement from the Dutch football association said. Marco Bizot, who was not named in the final 26-man squad by coach Frank de Boer, was already scheduled to travel to the camp in Portugal as a standby keeper, so no replacement is necessary, Reuters reports. Hungary has identified two cases of the coronavirus variant first detected in India, the government official in charge of vaccinations has said. Reuters reports: The central European country has been badly hit by the pandemic, and according to Johns Hopkins University data is the country with the most deaths per 100,000 people. An especially lethal third wave has been easing after an aggressive vaccination campaign. “The Indian variant is present in Hungary, according to experts we cannot exclude the possibility of a new wave of the pandemic,” Istvan Gyorgy, deputy minister and head of the government’s task force on vaccinations, told a news conference. Surgeon General Cecilia Muller added one of the two patients has recovered already. Contact tracing was unable to establish how they were infected. Neither of them spent time abroad recently. The World Health Organization has called for access to patients in the Gaza strip and free passage to evacuate them for medical treatment as health workers struggle to care for the sick and wounded after 11 days of violence. Reuters reports: WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib told a Geneva briefing that around 600 patients, including some with chronic conditions, needed to be referred outside of the Palestinian enclave since the start of the hostilities, but had been unable to due to crossing closures. “It’s very important that we help Palestinians get the care they need, especially helping them get treatment outside the Gaza strip,” she said. WHO has a presence on the ground, Chaib said, but was unable to confirm whether it currently had any access from the outside. Other aid agencies have complained about limited humanitarian access and drug supplies. Dozens of health centres were damaged during Israeli bombings earlier this month, prompting the WHO to warn that facilities risked being overwhelmed. “The capacity of the health system to respond is completely crushed,” Helen Ottens-Patterson, MSF head of mission in Gaza, told journalists earlier this week. In an indication of the challenges ahead, she said that an MSF team had to “wade through rubble and glass” to access a ministry of health compound earlier this week. AFP have this dispatch from Finland as the Scandinavian country opens drive-in voting for local elections on 13 June to manage the risk of Covid transmissions at traditional polling stations. Cars are queued up on an old airport runway on the outskirts of the Finnish capital Helsinki - not for coronavirus tests but for drivers to cast their vote. Outdoor polling stations have sprung up across the Nordic country as authorities try to make voting as socially distanced as possible ahead of the country’s local elections. “Signing in and filling out the ballot paper went brilliantly,” retiree Joukko Salminen tells AFP from inside his white car. “And corona safe too!” Finland’s municipal vote was due to take place in April but was postponed due to the pandemic, after which officials began looking for ways to cast ballots outside during a two-week advance voting period, while protecting the legally protected privacy of voters. “We’ve built screens that stop people being able to see the voting happening,” polling station manager Vesa Kouvonkorpi said. “Because the car is the polling booth, and by law you’re not allowed to see into the polling booth.” Although processing the drive-in votes takes about four times as long as the regular process, the outdoor polling station has proven popular and received 500 voters on its first day, Kouvonkorpi says. Mexico has administered roughly 27.7m doses – about 10.9% of the population – and president Andrés Manuel López Obrador has expressed hopes all adults will have had at least one dose by October. But vaccines have still been denied to many doctors, dentists and medical workers in private medicine – and also some physicians in public institutions. More health workers have died during the pandemic in Mexico than any other country in the hemisphere, according to the Pan-American Health Organisation. Fuelling doubts about whether the Olympics can go ahead safely, Japan’s government has, as expected extended a coronavirus emergency in Tokyo and other parts of the country until just a month before the Games. Organisers said they would now wait to take a decision on whether to allow local fans at the Games until the period ends on 20 June. AFP reports that fans from overseas have already been barred, in an unprecedented decision. Japan has seen a comparatively small virus outbreak, with around 12,500 deaths, and has avoided tough lockdowns. But a fourth wave has prompted the government to put emergency measures in place in 10 regions including the capital. The measures mostly limit the sale of alcohol in bars and restaurants and ask them to close early, while encouraging telework and capping audience numbers at events. “The number of new cases has been declining since the middle of the month but the situation continues to be uncertain,” said prime minister Yoshihide Suga, announcing the extension. Tokyo 2020 chief Seiko Hashimoto told reporters that with the measures being taken “we expect the infection situation to improve.” But she acknowledged that a decision on local fans, originally expected in early June, would now not be taken until the end of the month. “Once the state of emergency is lifted, we will assess how many spectators we can allow in,” she said, adding that there could be different rules for indoor and outdoor venues and the decision would be based on government guidelines. Even under the current state of emergency, sports venues in Japan are allowed to seat 5,000 spectators or 50 percent capacity, whichever is smallest. As pharmaceutical companies face growing pressure to waive patents to allow Covid vaccines to be manufactured quicker to allow more even distribution around the globe, Russia has provided an interesting model on what to do if you would like a certain medicine to be available in your country. Late last year, the Russian government granted Russian drugmaker Pharmasyntez a compulsory licence for one year to manufacture the anti-Covid-19 drug remdesivir under a different name without creator Gilead Science’s permission. Pharmasyntez had asked the Kremlin to allow it to produce a generic version of remdesivir before the decree was issued. Now, Russia’s supreme court has rejected a lawsuit from the US company that challenged the Russian government decision to let the firm develop and market the drug without their consent. Reuters reports that the government said in a decree at the time that the move was in the interests of Russia’s own security. According to the decree, Russia had to pay compensation to the drug’s patent-holder. The amount was not specified. Vikram Punia, its director, said the company had also written to Gilead in July last year to try to obtain their consent in the form of a voluntary licence, but had not heard back. Pharmasyntez produces remdesivir under the name Remdeform. A shipment of the drug was sent by Russia to India on Tuesday as part of a delivery of humanitarian aid. Gilead said in a statement it was disappointed by the ruling and called the issuance of a compulsory licence “unnecessary and counterproductive ... We have stood ready to work with Russia to expand access to Veklury [remdesevir] since [the] mid-2020. Intellectual property is not, and has never been, a significant barrier to access to medicines in Russia.” Its Mattha Busby here taking over the blog from my colleague Martin Belam. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening to everyone reading, do get in touch via Twitter with any thoughts or tips. Stay tuned for updates. Greece has said it is ready to use a Covid-19 travel certificate before its EU-wide launch on 1 July to attract foreign travellers and save its tourism sector from a second summer lost to the coronavirus. Spain’s prime minister Pedro Sanchez also confirmed his country would take part in the trials from 7 June. “This will be decisive in getting the certificate ready before summer begins and is big news for our tourism industry.” The deputy prime minister of Ireland, Leo Varadkar, has said that Irish citizens should be able move more freely across the European Union from mid-July, but cast doubt on whether it would also apply to Britain. South Africa is in a race against time to vaccinate as many people as possible amid signs the virus may be surging again with the approach of winter in the southern hemisphere, when people spend more time indoors, typically allowing for more spread of disease. Japan is expected to extend emergency coronavirus measures in Tokyo and several other regions by about three weeks, according to officials, as the country struggles to rein in a fourth wave of infections less than two months before the Olympics. Japan said it would consider sharing its Covid vaccines with other countries as a ruling party committee urged it to provide a portion of its AstraZeneca vaccine stock to Taiwan. Japan has also today approved the use of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine for those aged 12 and above. Weeks into Taiwan’s worst outbreak since the pandemic began, and 10 days after the island was put on the third highest level of social restrictions, daily totals of new cases are still not decreasing, the health minister has conceded. India reported on Friday 186,364 new coronavirus infections during the previous 24 hours, for its lowest daily rise since April 14, while deaths rose by 3,660. The south Asia region - India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Bhutan, Nepal, Maldives and Sri Lanka – accounts for 18% of global cases and almost 10% of deaths according to analysis by Reuters. The region has exceeded 30 million cases in total. Australia’s government is scrambling to administer first doses of Covid vaccines to unvaccinated aged care homes across Victoria on the first day of a week-long lockdown. Overcrowding in Victoria’s healthcare system is a “bigger public health emergency than Covid”, according to a leading emergency physician who says the state’s doctors and nurses were exhausted even before the latest outbreak in Australia. Czech restaurants will open to indoor diners from Monday. The Czech Republic will also open up to tourists from seven countries – Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia, Croatia, Austria and Germany – under reciprocal agreements. A €2.5bn (£2.15bn) package has been agreed by Germany’s government to help the culture industry get back on its feet as the country slowly emerges from a third wave of the Covid pandemic. The UK business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, has defended health secretary Matt Hancock against criticism that he failed to protect people in care homes at the outset of the Covid pandemic, saying residents “were protected as far as we could”. Professor Christina Pagel, from University College London and a member of Independent Sage, said the India variant was causing concern in England and the road map for reopening the economy should be delayed. Murdo Fraser of the Scottish Conservatives has criticised the continued restrictions in place across Glasgow. He has said if the latest data shows infections are still high then a “more targeted” approach was needed in Scotland. A royal academy chaired by Princess Chulabhorn, the youngest sibling of Thailand’s king, has said it would import 1 million doses of Sinopharm’s Covid-19 vaccine next month, after the Food and Drug Administration authorised its use. The Philippines has suspended the deployment of workers to Saudi Arabia after it received reports that their employers and recruiters were making them pay for Covid-19 testing, quarantine and insurance upon arrival in the kingdom. Russia has registered the world’s first vaccine for animals against Covid, its agricultural regulator said on Wednesday, after tests showed it generated antibodies against the virus in dogs, cats, foxes and mink Health ministers around the world are being urged to sign off on plans to create 6m more nursing jobs by 2030, amid warnings that Covid-19 has exacerbated a global shortage and could spark a “brain drain” from the developing world. That’s it from me, Martin Belam. I will be back on Tuesday. Harry Taylor has our UK live blog, Mattha Busby will be joining you here shortly to carry on bringing you the latest global Covid developments. The Philippines has suspended the deployment of workers to Saudi Arabia after it received reports that their employers and recruiters were making them pay for Covid-19 testing, quarantine and insurance upon arrival in the kingdom. Reuters report that Labour secretary Silvestre Bello said in an order that his department will issue an official statement on resumption of deployment “after this matter has been clarified accordingly”. It was not immediately clear how many Filipinos bound for Saudi Arabia would be directly affected. Saudi Arabia was the most preferred destination of overseas Filipino workers in 2019, government data showed, hosting one out of five Filipinos who landed jobs abroad during that year. The Scott Morrison government in Australia was scrambling to administer first doses of Covid vaccines to unvaccinated aged care homes across Victoria on the first day of a week-long lockdown, as federal ministers rejected criticism of the programme’s rollout. Facilities hurriedly prepared residents for rushed vaccines on Friday as the commonwealth raced to vaccinate neglected populations within the highest priority group it had initially promised to two months ago. The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, had said on Thursday there were 74 residential aged care homes across Australia that had not yet received an initial dose of Covid vaccine, including 16 in Victoria. But he went on a media blitz on Friday morning insisting every aged care home in the state would have received at least one dose by the weekend. The government’s push to vaccinate the remaining aged care homes in Victoria came a day after Hunt announced the recommended two-week interval between flu and Covid shots would be scrapped for aged care settings in Victoria. The operator of one aged care home in Melbourne, who asked not to be identified, told Guardian Australia they were surprised to learn vaccination teams were being sent to their facility on Friday. It presented logistical hurdles to prepare residents at such short notice, they said. Read more here: Federal government scrambles to vaccinate Victorian aged care homes as state enters first day of lockdown My colleague Haroon Siddique has a fuller write-up of those quotes from the UK business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng that we were carrying on this blog earlier: Kwasi Kwarteng defends Hancock over Covid care home claims As a reminder, UK Covid news is now being blogged by Harry Taylor over here: A royal academy chaired by Princess Chulabhorn, the youngest sibling of Thailand’s king, has said it would import 1m doses of Sinopharm’s Covid-19 vaccine next month, after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorised its use. The announcement in the official Royal Gazette surprised some members of the government, which had until now insisted on being the sole importer of Covid-19 vaccines. The FDA on Friday approved the Sinopharm coronavirus vaccine for emergency use, making it the fifth authorised by Thailand after AstraZenaca, Sinovac’s CoronaVac, Johnson &amp; Johnson’s Janssen and Moderna “We want to help plug in the gaps for business, schools, so they can move forward,” Nithi Mahanonda, secretarygeneral of the Chulabhorn Royal Academy told a news briefing. Reuters report that earlier this week, the academy announced it would import “alternative vaccines” to supplement the government campaign. The government says it will have 6m AstraZenaca doses and 3 million Sinovac doses available in June. Just over 1 million of Thailand’s more than 66 million people are fully vaccinated. Nithi said other organisations would be able to buy from the academy’s 1m Sinopharm doses, adding that it did not seek profit. Greece has said it is ready to use a Covid-19 travel certificate before its EU-wide launch on 1 July to attract foreign travellers and save its tourism sector from a second summer lost to the coronavirus. The free certificate will take the form of a QR code on a smartphone or paper, letting authorities determine the status of a visitor based on records in their home EU country. Greece was one of the early advocates of a certificate that would ease European Union travel curbs and help pull the country’s economy from recession by lifting tourism revenues. The European Council and parliament last week reached a deal on the digital green certificate following a rapid pick-up of vaccinations allowing widespread lifting of coronavirus curbs. The European parliament is expected to pass a law in the week from 7 June and more than a dozen EU countries, including France and Spain, have agreed to test the system before a launch on 1 July. The certificate would show if a person had received a vaccine, had a recent negative test or had immunity based on recovery. “It is very, very simple. Essentially, it includes all the information that a member-state would need to welcome a traveller without imposing additional restrictions,” Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said at a presentation of the pass on Friday. Lefteris Papadimas and Angeliki Koutantou report for Reuters that Mitsotakis added: “Greece is ready to launch this digital certificate earlier than 1 July.” He called on EU countries to ensure they stick to the deadlines and facilitate travel over the summer. In a separate event in the northern Spanish city of Soria, Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez also confirmed his country would take part in the trials from 7 June. “This will be decisive in getting the certificate ready before summer begins and is big news for our tourism industry.” South Africa is in a race against time to vaccinate as many people as possible amid signs the virus may be surging again with the approach of winter in the southern hemisphere, when people spend more time indoors, typically allowing for more spread of disease. It is also a critical front in the fight against the virus in Africa, with South Africa recording 40% of the continent’s Covid-19 deaths. Since January, South Africa has vaccinated nearly 500,000 of its 1.2 million healthcare workers and now is adding its older citizens to the campaign. In the past two weeks, nearly 200,000 have received their Pfizer jabs with instructions to come back in six weeks to get their second dose. After a plateau of the disease that lasted a few months, South Africa’s new cases, hospitalisations and deaths are trending up. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases has risen over the past two weeks from 3.33 per 100,000 people on 12 May to 3.97 per 100,000 on Wednesday, according to Johns Hopkins University. The seven-day rolling average of deaths is also on the rise: from 0.10 deaths per 100,000 people to 0.11 per 100,000 over the same period. The increase may seem small, but experts warn it may be the start of a resurgence as the country enters the colder winter months, which start in June. The national coronavirus task force met this week and President Cyril Ramaphosa’s government is pondering the possibility of reimposing restrictions, such as reducing the hours that alcohol can be sold and limiting the number of people at gatherings. “We’re under pressure to reach higher levels of vaccination,” Mosa Moshabela, professor of public health at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, told the Associated Press. “New vaccination centers are opening every day and the numbers being given shots should quickly go from 20,000 elderly per day to 50,000 and then 100,000 per day,” he said. “By June we should reach 200,000 per day. We need to have that kind of volume to get close to vaccinating 5 million elderly by the end of June.” South Africa’s overall goal is to vaccinate 67% of its 60 million people by February. Czech restaurants will open to indoor diners from Monday, health minister Adam Vojtech said this morning, announcing a quicker-than-planned easing of Covid-19 restrictions. Reuters report that the Czech Republic will also open up to tourists from seven countries – Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia, Croatia, Austria and Germany – under reciprocal agreements. Harry Taylor is on our UK live blog duties this morning, and he’s just got that started for the day. If you are after UK news, then you can follow that with him here … I’ll be continuing here with the latest global coronavirus news. The deputy prime minister of Ireland, Leo Varadkar, has said that Irish citizens should be able move more freely across the European Union from mid-July, but cast doubt on whether it would also apply to Britain. “The advice that we have, and we’re accepting this advice, is that there are real concerns about the Indian variant and for that reason, we’re not in a position to restore the common travel area just yet,” Varadkar told national broadcaster RTE. Reuters report he said there would continue to be restrictions for arrivals from Britain, including requirements to have a vaccine or a negative Covid-19 test, even once travel opens up using the EU’s “green certificate”. Very quick snap from Reuters that a Japanese health ministry panel has approved the use of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine for those aged 12 and above. The move, which lowers the threshold from 16, follows approvals in the US and other nations this month for the vaccine to be used for adolescents. On the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, UK business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng was pushed on the issue of people being discharged from hospital to care homes without testing. He was fairly steadfast in repeatedly saying that testing capacity had to be built from scratch, and that is what Matt Hancock and the department did. Weeks into Taiwan’s worst outbreak since the pandemic began, and 10 days after the island was put on the third highest level of social restrictions, daily totals of new cases are still not decreasing, the health minister has conceded. In today’s daily press conference, minister Chen Chih-shung reported 19 new deaths, 297 new cases and an additional 258 cases from a backlog of cases stretching as far as 10 days. He said the trends appeared stable, and were not rising, but the fact they were not visibly decreasing suggested there was still unidentified spread. The 19 deaths is the third consecutive record for daily fatalities. Taiwan is currently on alert level 3, of a four-tier system. Recreation, entertainment and sporting venues have closed, restaurants ordered to do take-away only, and working from home encouraged but not enforced. The backlog of cases has made assessment of trends - and the effectiveness of the response measures - difficult, with up to 95 cases at a time being added to previous daily totals. For the first time in this outbreak, Chen has flagged a possible move to level 4, requiring a lockdown. Until now he has said it would not happen unless there were 14 consecutive days of more than 100 cases (which has happened) and a rate of at least 50% untraced (which has not happened). He said they need to get a clearer picture of the trends, and would have more information early next week. Chen also announced local governments would be allowed to facilitate their own vaccine purchases, with FDA approval, acknowledging the central government’s processes were not procuring fast enough to meet Taiwan’s needs in the context of the current outbreak. About 330,000 people have received at least one vaccine so far, from a population of 24 million. Taiwan’s hospitals have also been told to double their Covid patient capacity by allowing two patients to a room, instead of one. A €2.5bn (£2.15bn) package has been agreed by the German government to help the culture industry get back on its feet as the country slowly emerges from a third wave of the Covid pandemic. The finance minister, Olaf Scholz, has called the package “the biggest cultural subsidy programme” since the end of the second world war. The coronavirus cultural fund is intended to give organisers of events assurances that they will be compensated if performances and concerts are not able to go ahead as planned, as well as making up for the loss of ticket sales due to reduced seating as a result of social distancing regulations. Initially the measures will protect events of up to 500 participants, so that if from 1 July an event has to be cancelled, the organiser will be fully compensated. From the end of August, in anticipation of events being able to increase in size, that will go up to 2,000 participants. The measures, coming as Germany starts to open up after months of tight restrictions, are on top of a multimillion-euro neustart kultur (new start culture) programme announced last year to cover events across the country. “Life is starting again after a long coronavirus winter,” Scholz said. Monika Grütters, the culture minister, said the fund sent a signal to the cultural industry that its “resuscitation deserves the same amount of effort which is being given to other branches”. Read more of Kate Connolly’s report from Berlin: Germany agrees €2.5bn package to help revive Covid-hit culture sector Yesterday UK housing minister Robert Jenrick was touting next spring as a possible starting date for a Covid inquiry. Opposition Labour MP David Lammy has just joined calls to rapidly bring that date forward in the light of the revelations from Dominic Cummings earlier in the week. Meanwhile on LBC, shock-jock Nick Ferrari has been lambasting business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng saying he should be “kicking the door down” of the prime minister, “banging the desk and saying ‘We have got to stick to 21 June, prime minister!’”. Kwarteng replies “You know what Nick, that’s exactly what I’m doing.” The rest of his answer doesn’t make it sound like he is doing that, however, as he reiterates form his earlier media appearances that “What I can’t do is give guarantees on the 28 May” and continues to hold the line that the government will be following the data and there will not be a decision until 14 June. Mario Koran reports for us from Milwaukee that Wisconsin is the ground zero of America’s battle against vaccine hesitancy: Vaccination rates in Wisconsin vary widely between rural and urban areas and political, religious and racial divides – a pattern that mirrors the divide across the nation. In the progressive stronghold of Dane county – home to the University of Wisconsin-Madison – more than 65% of the population has received one dose. In the state’s rural north, Taylor county has vaccinated only 23.5% of the population, state data shows. Vaccine availability once posed the biggest barrier to immunization. But as availability increased, demand plateaued. Now, healthcare professionals are strategizing ways to reach those who haven’t yet been vaccinated but remain open to it. “Most of our rural residents have the information they need about where and when to get vaccinated. So this is no longer primarily an issue about access to the vaccine. It truly is an issue of what is commonly called vaccine hesitancy,” said Tim Size, executive director of the Rural Wisconsin Health Cooperative, a network of 43 rural hospitals. “I’m not talking about those who just say hell will freeze over before they get the vaccine. That’s not where I think any of us probably need to spend our energy because it’s unlikely to get much traction. I’m talking about the number of people who are communicating that they’re not quite ready yet, but with more information and conversation, they may get there.” Read more of Mario Koran’s report from Milwaukee here: Wisconsin: ground zero of America’s battle against vaccine hesitancy Prof Christina Pagel, from University College London and a member of Independent Sage, said the India variant was causing concern and the road map should be delayed. She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “Certainly we have weakened the link significantly between cases and hospitalisations, but we haven’t broken it.” She added: “We now have fewer restrictions in England than we’ve had since the pandemic started, so if enough people get infected, even a really small proportion who need hospital can still end up being quite large absolute numbers.” Asked whether the planned further lockdown easing for 21 June should not go ahead, she said: “So far we’ve kind of been crossing our fingers a little bit, Sage and Public Health England both say it’s a more transmissible variant, we know it has some levels of vaccine escape. “So we’re in a situation where, compared to two months ago, we now have a dominant variant, it transmits faster, and our vaccines are less effective against it.” PA Media reports that asked if it would be “very demoralising” to remain as we are now, she said: “I think what’s demoralising is having a third wave. If we can just delay international travel, delay stage 4 of the road map until we have a much higher proportion of people vaccinated with two doses, we’re in a much, much better position. “We’re only two months away from that, it’s not long to wait. What I don’t want is for us to have new restrictions.” In the UK, business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has become the latest minister to defend health secretary Matt Hancock, saying “Very few people – if anyone – worked as hard as he did.” Hancock had an awkward time in front of parliament yesterday following accusations by former government adviser Dominic Cummings that he had lied to colleagues and the public during the early stages of the pandemic. Kwarteng said: “I think what Matt stressed very carefully yesterday was that he was absolutely focused, right from the start of the pandemic, on saving people’s lives. “He was in a difficult situation as the Health Secretary, in a pandemic, the like of which we hadn’t seen for 100 years. He was under huge pressure. “And as a Cabinet colleague, I know that he worked really hard and very few people - if anyone - worked as hard as he did and he was very committed to saving lives. Now, he said what he said, I fully believe him but we’ll have an inquiry and that will iron out all these facts.” Poulomi Ghosh reports for the Hindustan Times on a vaccine mix-up causing concern: At least 20 people in Uttar Pradesh’s Siddharthnagar district bordering Nepal were administered with different doses of vaccines, in a case of “negligence”. The 20 people who received two different vaccines in two slots are all from Audahi Kalan village and are aged above 45 years. On 1 April, there were given a dose of Covishield, which was their first dose. On 14 May, they were administered the second dose and as the health workers did not check the card to find out which vaccine was administered to them earlier, they were given Covaxin, by mistake. Reports said none of them reported any adverse effect. There are controlled trials ongoing in some countries of mixing vaccines to see if it increases effectiveness. Murdo Fraser of the Scottish Conservatives has criticised the continued restrictions in place across Glasgow. PA Media reports that he has said if the latest data shows infections are still high then a “more targeted” approach was needed. Areas of Glasgow with higher concentrations of coronavirus infections should be targeted with testing and vaccinations rather than the whole city being subject to “blanket” restrictions, the Scottish Conservatives have said. Fraser told the BBC’s Good Morning Scotland: “Our view is the current council-wide lockdown in Glasgow has not been the right approach. “Large parts of Glasgow do not see large numbers of people infected with Covid and yet are affected by these lockdown restrictions. “If the data is still showing a specific problem in Glasgow what we should be doing is isolating that problem … localised surge testing, accelerating vaccinations in those communities and greater support for local businesses who have been really suffering.” Glasgow has been under strict coronavirus restrictions for 270 days and is the only part of the country under tougher Level 3 constraints. An update on restrictions in Scotland’s largest city is expected later today from first minister Nicola Sturgeon. Overcrowding in Victoria’s healthcare system is a “bigger public health emergency than Covid”, according to a leading emergency physician who says the state’s doctors and nurses were exhausted even before the latest outbreak. Victoria is in a seven-day lockdown with 30 cases of community transmission, more than 120 exposure sites, and 15,000 primary and secondary contacts of cases in isolation. The Australasian College for Emergency Medicine Victoria faculty chair, Dr Mya Cubitt, said on Friday that doctors and nurses in public hospitals had been dreading such a situation because they were still recovering from Victoria’s second wave in 2020. At its height, there were more than 700 new cases in a single day. There were 768 deaths overall with hundreds of healthcare workers infected. “We are in the worst crisis that healthcare has faced in many years,” Cubitt said. “You could even say – and I’d love to speak with [chief health officer Prof] Brett Sutton about this – that the access block and overcrowding of the system is the bigger public health emergency at the moment. Whether we have a Covid outbreak or not, emergency clinicians, and all of the many colleagues that we intersect with in the healthcare system, are under extreme pressure.” Read more of Melissa Davey’s report here: Overcrowding in Victorian hospitals ‘bigger emergency than Covid’, expert warns Sky News have just posted a clip of that Kwasi Kwarteng interview on Twitter. Reuters have been looking at the impact of Covid in the South Asia region, and have found that the tally of cases there, according to their figures, passed 30 million today. They report that the south Asia region - India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Bhutan, Nepal, Maldives and Sri Lanka – accounts for 18% of global cases and almost 10% of deaths. But there is growing suspicion that official tallies of infections and deaths are not reflecting the true extent of the problem. India’s decision to halt the export of vaccines until at least October has had a knock-on effect, with other South Asia countries such as Nepal and Bangladesh making diplomatic efforts to secure Covid-19 vaccines to prop up their faltering inoculation drives as their stocks run out. India’s western neighbour Pakistan, with purchases and donations from China and allocations from the World Health Organisation and the GAVI Vaccine Alliance, has now secured more than 18m doses. Pakistan has opened its vaccination campaign to everyone aged 19 or older. As I mentioned, business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has been on Sky News, and he was rather downbeat when asked about the prospects for the roadmap out of lockdown. He said: We don’t want to proceed with the roadmap without considering all the information that we have. I think that the numbers of cases, is a matter of concern. Today’s the 28th of May. It’s impossible for anyone to know what the situation will be like in a week or two weeks time. On the positive side, he said “the other thing that’s very helpful and encouraging, is the fact that the numbers of hospitalizations, and the number of fatalities as well, is considerably lower than it was even just two months ago” Ultimately he keep reiterating that the UK government would be guided by data: There’s lots of facts that we have to consider. I, as business secretary, I’m very committed to try to reopen on 21 June, I can’t guarantee that. And as I’ve said, we’re looking at the data, every day. The UK government dashboard shows that cases, deaths and hospitalisations are all going up, albeit at much lower levels than they were at the height of the pandemic. Kwarteng confirmed that there would be no decision before 14 June. Good morning from London, it is Martin Belam here – you can get in touch with me at martin.belam@theguardian.com. The UK’s business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng looks to have drawn the short straw for media duties this morning – he’ll be on Sky News in a few moments. While we wait for that, here’s Lizzy Davies on calls for 6m more nurses worldwide: Health ministers around the world are being urged to sign off on plans to create 6m more nursing jobs by 2030, amid warnings that Covid-19 has exacerbated a global shortage and could spark a “brain drain” from the developing world. Delegates meeting virtually this week at the World Health Assembly, the key decision-making body of the World Health Organization, are expected to adopt a resolution calling on countries to transform the nursing profession through more investment, support and training. The WHO director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, called on countries to invest in healthcare workers, nearly 50% of whom are nurses and midwives, saying the pandemic had reminded everyone “that these are incredible people doing incredible jobs under incredible circumstances”. “We owe them so much, and yet globally health and care workers often lack the protection, the equipment, the training, the decent pay, the safe working conditions and the respect they deserve,” he said in his opening remarks. “If we have any hope of achieving a healthier, safer, fairer future, every member state must protect and invest in its health and care workforce as a matter of urgency.” Read more here: ‘Protect and invest’: WHO calls for 6m more nurses worldwide That’s it from me, Helen Sullivan, for today. And if, for a break from pandemic news, you’d like to see a praying mantis wearing “tiny homemade 3D glasses”, might I suggest: Russia has registered the world’s first vaccine for animals against Covid, its agricultural regulator said on Wednesday, after tests showed it generated antibodies against the virus in dogs, cats, foxes and mink, Reuters reports. Mass production of the vaccine, called Carnivac-Cov, can start in April, regulator Rosselkhoznadzor said. The World Health Organization has expressed concern over the transmission of the virus between humans and animals. The regulator said the vaccine would be able to protect vulnerable species and thwart viral mutations. Russia has so far only registered two cases of Covid among animals, both in cats. Denmark culled all 17 million mink on its farms last year after concluding that a strain of the virus had passed from humans to mink and that mutated strains of the virus had then turned up among people. Rosselkhoznadzor said Russian fur farms planned to buy the vaccine, along with businesses in Greece, Poland and Austria. Russia’s fur farm industry accounts for around 3% of the global market, down from 30% in the Soviet era, according to the main trade body. Thailand’s food and drug regulator on Friday approved for emergency use the coroanvirus vaccine developed by China’s Sinopharm, Reuters reports, citing a senior official. “The FDA has approved the Sinopharm vaccine,” senior health official Paisan Dankhum told a news conference, making it the fifth Covid-19 vaccine Thailand has approved. Japanese shares jumped on Friday, as investors scooped up stocks after sell-offs due to MSCI’s reshuffle in the previous session, while progress in the country’s vaccination drive lifted risk appetite on prospects of a swift economic recovery, Reuters reports. The Nikkei share average crossed the 29,000 level for the first time since 11 May, jumping 1.95% to 29,106.86, as of 0205 GMT. The index is poised for a weekly gain of 2.8%. Rollouts of Covid vaccines have contributed to positive sentiment as investors hope a steady vaccination drive can help accelerate economic recovery, market participants said. Japan said on Friday it would consider sharing its Covid vaccines with other countries as a ruling party committee urged it to provide a portion of its AstraZeneca Plc vaccine stock to Taiwan, Reuters reports. Taiwan is battling a spike in domestic infections and has vaccinated only about 1% of its population, while Japan has secured more than 400 million doses, double what it needs for its adult population. “We think it’s important to ensure fair access to safe and effective vaccines in every country and region towards achieving universal health coverage,” Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato told a news conference. “We will swiftly consider and look into a concrete course of policy with regard to how we provide other countries and regions with vaccines that exceed the amount for those needed at home. Masahisa Sato, the head of a Japanese ruling party committee on Taiwan relations, said earlier on Friday the government should provide Taiwan with vaccines as soon as possible, adding “when Japan was in need Taiwan sent us 2 million masks.” Kato declined to comment whether Tokyo had received supply requests from specific countries. India reported on Friday 186,364 new coronavirus infections during the previous 24 hours, for its lowest daily rise since April 14, while deaths rose by 3,660. The South Asian nation’s tally of infections now stands at 27.56 million, with the death toll at 318,895, health ministry data show. Japan is expected to extend emergency coronavirus measures in Tokyo and several other regions by about three weeks, according to officials, as the country struggles to rein in a fourth wave of infections less than two months before the Olympics. The state of emergency – the third in the capital since the start of the pandemic – was called in late April and was originally due to end on 11 May, but was extended until the end of this month, as restrictions on businesses failed to make a dent in infections. Media reports said the latest extension could last until 20 June. Infections have fallen in Tokyo in recent days, but the daily caseload is still too high to justify an end to the measures, according to medical experts, while hospitals are contending with a record number of critically ill Covid-19 patients: Hello and welcome to today’s live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic with me, Helen Sullivan. As always, you can get in touch with me on Twitter @helenrsullivan. India reported on Friday 186,364 new coronavirus infections during the previous 24 hours, for its lowest daily rise since April 14, while deaths rose by 3,660. The South Asian nation’s tally of infections now stands at 27.56 million, with the death toll at 318,895, health ministry data show. Meanwhile Japan is expected to extend emergency coronavirus measures in Tokyo and several other regions by about three weeks, according to officials, as the country struggles to rein in a fourth wave of infections less than two months before the Olympics. Here are the key developments from the last few hours: Argentina reported a record one-day number of new Covid-19 cases of 41,080 on Thursday, amid a second wave of infections that has made the country one of the hardest hit in the world, pushing the local health care system to its limit. Africa needs at least 20m doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine within six weeks if those who have had their first shot are to get the second in time, the WHO said on Thursday. Up to three-quarters of new UK Covid cases are thought to be caused by the variant first detected in India, as the reported number more than doubled to almost 7,000, Matt Hancock said on Thursday. The United States called on Thursday for the World Health Organization to carry out a second phase of its investigation into the origins of the coronavirus, with independent experts given full access to original data and samples in China. The US intelligence community acknowledged its agencies had two theories on where Covid-19 originated, with an element embracing a possible laboratory accident as the source of the pandemic. US President Joe Biden said he is likely to release a report detailing the US intelligence community’s findings on the origins of Covid-19 in full. Sweden will go forward with its plan to ease some of its Covid curbs from June 1, prime minister Stefan Lofven said. Germany plans to make enough Covid vaccine doses available to offer a first shot to all children aged 12 and over by the end of August, a draft health ministry document showed.","charCount":"55335","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/mattha-busby\">Mattha Busby</a> (now); <a href=\"profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a> and <a href=\"profile/helen-sullivan\">Helen Sullivan</a> (earlier)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/live/2021/may/28/champions-league-final-and-play-offs-news-weekend-football-countdown","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-28T14:06:06Z","webTitle":"Champions League final and play-offs news – weekend football countdown!","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2021/may/28/champions-league-final-and-play-offs-news-weekend-football-countdown","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2021/may/28/champions-league-final-and-play-offs-news-weekend-football-countdown","fields":{"headline":"Champions League final and play-offs news – weekend football countdown!","standfirst":"<ul><li>The latest news ahead of Saturday’s showpiece in Porto</li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/may/27/thomas-tuchel-chelsea-inside-the-mind-of-an-obsessive-with-the-winning-touch\">Tuchel: inside the mind of an obsessive with a winning touch</a></li><li>And you can <a href=\"mailto:david.tindall.casual@theguardian.com\">email</a> David, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DaveTindallgolf\">tweet</a> or post BTL</li></ul>","trailText":"The latest news ahead of Saturday’s showpiece in Porto and the crunch weekend at Wembley.

(Via PA) “Brentford will make a late call on Christian Norgaard ahead of the play-off final against Swansea. “Denmark midfielder Norgaard pulled up injured prior to the semi-final second leg win over Bournemouth. “Left-back Rico Henry has been ruled out of the Wembley showpiece with a hamstring injury. “Josh Dasilva and Shandon Baptiste remain long-term absentees. “Swansea will be without Wayne Routledge after the veteran wideman suffered a knee injury in the semi-final win over Barnsley. “Routledge, who has made over 300 appearances in nearly 10 years at Swansea, is out of contract at the end of the season and may have played his last game for the club. “Young midfielder Oli Cooper also misses out after suffering a knee injury in training. “Defender Brandon Cooper had already been ruled out with an ankle sprain, but apart from that namesake boss Steve has a clean bill of health.” Could Erling Haaland be playing for Manchester City, Chelsea or Manchester United in the near future? Maybe, but his latest quotes suggest it won’t be this summer. The Norwegian has been a sensation at Borussia Dortmund so far, scoring 59 goals in 57 appearances. That included a double in the 4-1 DFB-Pokal final win over RB Leipzig earlier this month. He’s been speaking to Jan Aage Fjortoft on Viaplay and had this to say: “Well I have a contract for a couple of years, so I am respectful towards my contract. I am a simple guy. When I like something I just want to have more – when I score a goal, I always chase the next goal.” As for securing Champions League football and a first trophy with Dortmund: “It was a relief to secure that spot. It was really important. Like I have said before I am a big fan of the Champions League and I think everybody knows that. I have big dreams. I just won my first major trophy and it was a great feeling. So I want to win trophies.” News from Brentford boss Thomas Frank ahead of Saturday’s play-off final against Swansea. Team news: “From the last squad, the only doubt is Christian Nørgaard. We will assess him and take a decision later today. Rico Henry is out.” On mood in the camp: “We are excited. I was thinking about it driving home from training yesterday that the atmosphere was calm and focused. There is that good focus with the understanding we are facing a Swansea team that has done a fantastic season.” On Swansea: “We’ve played them twice, both 1-1 draws. Steve Cooper is one of the most talented managers in this country, and his experienced coaching staff, who have just performed and performed even better. It’s going to be unbelievably tight.” On last year’s experience: “I think it is a plus, how big a plus you don’t really know. That experience from last year will help in a way but it is not like we are suddenly 20 per cent better. It might help in the decisive moments.” On pre-match nerves: “We will all be a tiny bit more tense but that is a good thing. It is important that we do everything we can to be brave and make sure that we don’t regret anything when we look back. If we perform well then we can’t do more.” On fans: “You saw in the game against Bournemouth how much the fans can help us; they had a massive impact on the result. We need the fans there to cheer us on throughout the game because this game will take twists and turns.” Some departures to note. Aston Villa are releasing Ahmed Elmohamady, Neil Taylor and goalkeeper Tom Heaton. The former Burnley stopper did not appear for Villa this season and has been reported to have agreed a deal to return to Manchester United. Also, Ibrahima Konaté’s arrival at Liverpool means another central defender is on his way. Another switch. David Tindall here again. You want content? Here’s the latest from Chelsea with a clip of Thomas Tuchel boarding a plane and, erm, all sorts. Confirmed: Max is back. Massimiliano Allegri is the Juventus manager once more. Now we are ready to begin again with Allegri, to build our future together with his enormous professionalism, his moral strength, with the brilliant ideas of a coach capable of shuffling the cards, both on and off the pitch. With his smile, a sort of ‘signature’. With his way of understanding football and life with simplicity, with his desire to play things down and with the commitment to enjoy every beautiful moment that being at Juventus can give and will give. This here tweet means Max Allegri is going back to Juventus. That’s a map of the state of Minnesota. To quote James Horncastle, writing for ESPN in 2019, this is why. One day at the races, Allegri bet on a horse by the name of Minnesota. The odds of it winning were very long, so long that a friend joked it was about as likely to come in first as Allegri was to make it as a coach. Minnesota won, and Allegri not only collected his winnings, he went on to become one of the leading coaches of his generation. An important piece from David Conn. Andy Hunter reports on Liverpool’s latest defensive recruit. Some play-off content now. Steve Cooper, the Swansea manager, has been speaking. Cooper was the Welshman who coached England to winning the Under-20 World Cup in 2017. Now for the hundred bazillion million game that the TV commentators will keep mentioning the price of. It’s my biggest game in club football, of course. But I haven’t thought about it being my biggest game in management. I just think about what it means to the football club and the supporters. It’s a proud city, a proud football club, we are very much together as a community because we haven’t got any clubs around us. Going up to Wembley is a real together club trying to do the business, and I’m very much focused on what’s in hand and what I can control. You have to get the balance right between the magnitude of the game and what’s at stake. There’s no point in ignoring that because there’s so much to play for. But it’s a game and you still have to stick to your way of working, stick to the plan, give consistent messages so the players feel as comfortable and as clear as they can be. There’s lots of stuff around the game, but it’s a football match we need to be ready for. The play-off final ten years ago announced Brendan Rodgers to the world when he took Swansea up. Sid Lowe hears from the man who worked with Guardiola at Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Manchester City. Great snippet on how long it took for Pep to realise Phil Foden was the genuine article. More on Pirlo/Allegri here. In other news, Liverpool have signed a defender, Ibrahima Konaté from RB Leipzig. From Liverpool’s press release. The 22-year-old defender has agreed a long-term contract with the Reds from July 1, subject to international clearance and a successful work permit application process, after finalising terms and passing a medical. Konate said: “I’m really happy to be joining such a massive club like Liverpool. “It’s a really exciting moment for me and my family and I am really looking forward to meeting my new teammates, the staff and getting started on this new chapter. “Right now, my focus is on the U21 European Championships with France, but after this competition I know I will be joining one of the best teams in the world and that gives me a great feeling.” Time for a toblerone so I’ll hand back to John Brewin... Recent Champions League finals between sides from the same country. The smart money says Man City v Chelsea could go beyond 90 minutes. Milan 0-0 Juventus (Milan won on pens) Man Utd 1-1 Chelsea (Man Utd won on pens) Bayern 2-1 Borussia Dortmund Real Madrid 1-1 Atletico Madrid (4-1 after ET) Liverpool 2-0 Tottenham Thankfully, Wayne Rooney didn’t ‘Steve Morrow’ Paul Scholes. A nice lunchtime sports quiz sprinkled with a bit of football. No excuses for getting under 6 out of 10. Sunday morning as Tuchel celebrates (see 12:05 entry). “Guten Tag, Roman. Ich habe viele Toblerones gegessen vier insgesamt. Ich habe vier weissen ubrig, weil ich die weissen nicht gerne esse und habe die dunklen lieber.” Another stat to mull over. Chelsea a ‘bogey’ team? In his entire managerial career, Man City manager Pep Guardiola has lost more matches against Chelsea in all competitions than any other club (7). He has lost his last two games against the Blues, only losing three in a row against Real Madrid (2012-14) and Liverpool (2018). Tuchel not a drinker but looks like he could demolish a few Ritter Sport if all goes well. A celebratory drive to Düsseldorf in his bare feet perhaps? From our fun facts piece by Michael Butler: After victories I’m prone to all kinds of messes: chocolate, peanuts, chips. Fast food only very rarely. Something special must have happened there. And it has to be dark, otherwise I can’t get fast food down. Surely Phil Foden and Bernado Silva have to start if Pep reads his glossy Champions League Opta stat pack. Since featuring in a 2-1 defeat to Lyon in September 2018, Manchester City’s Bernardo Silva is unbeaten in his last 26 UEFA Champions League matches (W23 D3) – the longest unbeaten run in the history of the competition. His team-mate Phil Foden is on the second-longest current run, unbeaten in 21 matches (W18 D3) since playing in a defeat to Basel in March 2018. It’s not just the Simpsons that predicts the future. Just under 36 years before Manchester United and Villarreal were deadlocked after 90 minutes, here’s another big, fancied English team being held by Spanish minnows in a European final. Surely this Basora character should have gone for that tackle. Petr &gt; Didier when it comes to drawing. Managerial vacancies now at three big clubs. And Tottenham. Juve, Real Madrid and Inter all sifting through candidates. If the bookies are to be believed, it’s Antonio Conte (8/11) to Real and Mauricio Pochettino (4/11) back to Spurs. Massimiliano Allegri is also being heavily linked with a return to Juventus. Talking of the Super League, Juventus have announced the departure of head coach Andrea Pirlo after just one season in charge. Finishing fourth after nine successive titles just didn’t cut it. Here’s the goodbye on the official Juventus website. Are you sitting comfortably children?... Thanks Andrea. These are the first words that all of us must pronounce at the end of this special experience lived together. A few months ago Andrea Pirlo, an icon of world football, began a new adventure on the Juventus bench, his first as a coach. To do this, first of all it takes courage, as well as awareness of one’s own means, especially in a period marked by many difficulties, with the world forced by the pandemic to reinvent its own rules day after day. Andrea did it too: he started (and we are sure of this: his will be a brilliant career as a coach) a journey of transformation, seeking, and often managing, to bring his ideas and his experience as a champion on the pitch from the “Other side” of the barricade. For the courage, the dedication, the passion with which he demonstrated every day, our thanks go to the ‘Maestro’, the coach and to Andrea, that really comes from the heart, as well as our good luck for the future that will surely be a wonderful one. Well, no-one thought this was going to just Fade Away... We’ve heard from Noel but nothing yet from Liam about the Champions League final. At least he didn’t miss this open goal after Wednesday night’s events in Gdansk. David Tindall here now. While John goes off to eat cake after putting the thought in his mind, I’ll take the blog for a while. They will probably hold off the chocolate cake for tonight. Plenty of time for that on Sunday. Saturday night in the Estádio do Dragão will all be about mentality, and Ben Welch’s piece for the Blizzard, carried in these pages, hears from psychologists and players who share their tips for staying self-assured. The rest of the Premier League will look on at City and Chelsea with gimlet eyes, but the transfer window is about to be prised open. Manchester United look like early market movers, though we probably say that every year. Noel Gallagher has been talking to the BBC about Manchester City and, well, himself. What Manchester City have done is exactly what the owners said would happen. When they came in and said they were determined to turn us into one of the biggest clubs in Europe and the world, all I was thinking was, I don’t care what you do, as long as that banner comes down at Old Trafford, the one showing how long we’d been without a trophy. I remember meeting [City chairman] Khaldoon Al Mubarak at the start and telling him that and he was adamant, saying ‘oh no no no, it’s going to be much greater than that’. I was like ‘whatever’ but my God they have been true to their word and it has just been an amazing journey that the club has been on. It feels like quite a neat anniversary - we’ve had 10 years of the High Flying Birds and 10 years of City in the Champions League. Not only that but it’s my birthday on Saturday and I’m going to be in Porto, so it’s a big day all round. And here’s the brilliant Barney Ronay on Kevin De Bruyne, the main man for Manchester City. De Bruyne will turn 30 next month. He’s about to play his 494th professional game. To date he has three Premier League titles, an FA Cup and five League Cups, which is certainly a lot of League Cups. He has been player of the year in England, Germany and Belgium, but never above ninth spot in the Ballon d’Or. This will be Manchester City’s second European final. Remembering Big Mal, Joe Mercer, the other Neil Young with those who were in Vienna in 1970, including City stalwart Tommy Booth. Jacob Steinberg dove deeply into Tactics Tom ahead of the final. Great piece. Saturday is also upon us, and it will be a tremendous day of red hot soccer. Brentford and Swansea, two teams who play the game the ‘right’ way will serve as an hors d’oeuvre for the evening’s events in Porto when they play in the EFL Championship play-off final. It will be a match when every kick can be measured by how much money it might cost, football divined right down to the pecuniary. Talking of which, can Manchester City reach the holy grail of winning the competition their owners set out to win on buying the club in 2008 or will Roman Abramovich celebrate success for the second time, having set out a similar target five years before. Setting aside such cynicism, both games promise so much with Thomas Tuchel seeming to have Pep Guardiola’s number so far this season and Swansea and Brentford drew both their games 1-1 in the regular season. Last year, of course, Brentford did a number on the Swans in the play-off semis only to lose to Scott Parker’s Fulham. Two different matches, two rather different forms of jeopardy.

Kamala Harris is making some history this morning: the vice-president will become the first woman to deliver the commencement address at the US Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. The New York Times reports: The vice president’s speech is expected to focus on some of the Biden administration’s most urgent challenges, like the coronavirus pandemic, climate change and a host of increasingly sophisticated cybersecurity threats. ‘The global pandemic has launched us into a new era. It has forever impacted our world,’ Ms. Harris is expected to say, according to prepared remarks shared with The New York Times. ‘If we weren’t clear before, we know now: Our world is interconnected. Our world is interdependent. Our world is fragile.’ The vice president’s speech at the Naval Academy, in Annapolis, Md., will be her first to focus on the military, and it comes as the Biden administration is accelerating its withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, well ahead of the deadline President Biden set in April: Sept. 11. According to a press pool report, Harris stopped at the gravesite of John McCain before her speech to pay her respects to the late senator and lay some flowers on his headstone. The state of Arizona is preparing to kill death row inmates using hydrogen cyanide, the same lethal gas that was deployed at Auschwitz. Documents obtained by the Guardian reveal that Arizona’s department of corrections has spent more than $2,000 in procuring the ingredients to make cyanide gas. The department bought a solid brick of potassium cyanide in December for $1,530. It also purchased sodium hydroxide pellets and sulfuric acid which are intended to be used to generate the deadly gas. The gas chamber itself, built in 1949 and disused for 22 years, has been dusted off and, according to the department, “refurbished”. Over the past few months the Republican-controlled state has moved aggressively to restart its deeply flawed execution system. The death penalty has been in abeyance in Arizona for seven years following the gruesomely botched lethal injection of Joseph Wood in 2014. Last month, the Guardian revealed that Arizona spent a jaw-dropping $1.5m on a batch of pentobarbital in October, a sedative which it now hopes to use as its main lethal injection method. The Senate is now back in session to wrap up votes on the Endless Frontier Act before holding a vote on the January 6 commission bill. The upper chamber stood in recess for a little over six hours. Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff of Georgia gaveled out the Senate at 2:52 am this morning, per a C-SPAN producer. Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer said in a floor speech moments ago that he expects the chamber to pass the Endless Frontier Act later today. “We have every intention of sticking it out until the job is done, and that’s what we’re going to do,” Schumer said. At least 70% of people charged in the Capitol riot have been released as they wait for trial, according to a Guardian analysis. That high pretrial release rate stands in stark contrast with the usual detention rates in the federal system, where only 25% of defendants nationwide are typically released before their trial. Eric Munchel, known as “Zip Tie Guy”, who was allegedly photographed wearing tactical gear and carrying wrist restraints in the Senate chamber, was released in late March, along with his mother, after an appeals court questioned whether he posed any danger outside the specific context of 6 January. Richard Barnett, the Arkansas man photographed with his foot on Nancy Pelosi’s desk, was released in late April, nearly two months after screaming during a court hearing that “it’s not fair” that he was still in custody when “everybody else who did things much worse are already home”. Multiple alleged members of the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers, two groups facing the most serious conspiracy charges related to their alleged plans for violence, have been released before trial, though some prominent leaders in these groups remain in custody. The disparity in pretrial detention rates highlights what legal experts said was a broader development in the 6 January cases: the likelihood that a substantial swathe of the alleged rioters may not serve any prison time at all, even if they are convicted or plead guilty. Greetings from Washington, live blog readers. The Senate is expected to vote later today on whether to advance the bill to form a bipartisan commission to study the Capitol insurrection – for real this time. The Senate was originally planning to hold a procedural vote on the commission bill yesterday, but some late-night disagreements over the Endless Frontier Act pushed the vote to today. Now the vote is expected to take place later this morning or possibly early this afternoon, according to CNN. Senate Republican leaders seem confident that they have the votes to defeat the bill, which they worry could jeopardize their hopes of taking back Congress in next year’s midterm elections. Senator Lisa Murkowski, one of the few Republicans who is expected to support the commission bill, sharply criticized that logic yesterday. “To be making a decision for the short-term political gain at the expense of understanding and acknowledging what was in front of us on January 6, I think we need to look at that critically. Is that really what this is about, one election cycle after another?” Murkowski told reporters. The blog will have more details on the vote as it unfolds, so stay tuned.","charCount":"6181","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/joan-greve\">Joan E Greve</a> in Washington"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2021/may/28/my-brother-diet-harmful","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-28T14:00:03Z","webTitle":"How do I tell my brother his diet could be harmful?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/may/28/my-brother-diet-harmful","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2021/may/28/my-brother-diet-harmful","fields":{"headline":"How do I tell my brother his diet could be harmful?","standfirst":"<p>You articulate it as worrying about his health, but I think it goes deeper than that, says Annalisa Barbieri</p>","trailText":"You articulate it as worrying about his health, but I think it goes deeper than that, says Annalisa Barbieri","byline":"Annalisa Barbieri","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8af4bd8e12284cddbd04d3ae9e4e2a3a105e6f55\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8af4bd8e12284cddbd04d3ae9e4e2a3a105e6f55/0_0_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Floating burger\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘If you want to talk to your brother, it needs to be about what you really feel.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Lo Cole/The  Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p><strong>I’m in my late 40s and </strong><strong>have a brother who is a couple of years younger than me. </strong><strong>He’s been happily married for almost 20 years and has a lovely daughter, who is in her early teens.</strong></p> <p><strong>Some years ago, he </strong><strong>was treated for cancer (</strong><strong>he has been in remission </strong><strong>since), and I am </strong><strong>happy he has managed to find his way in life. </strong><strong>Our parents died two years ago, and we are all the family we have</strong><strong>; we’ve had our differences, but in reconciling we probably understand each other better than ever.</strong></p> <p><strong>However, I </strong><strong>can’t get over the horrible feeling that the food he and his wife </strong><strong>provide for the family is far from healthy, and actually harmful.

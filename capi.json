This is reflected in the number of initial jobless claims filed last week which fell to 406,000, below the consensus forecast of 425,000 and the prior week’s pandemic-era low of 444,000. Continuing claims, which have gone sideways for the last few weeks, came in marginally lower than expected at 3.642 million versus 3.68 expected and 3.751 during the prior week.</p> <p>Investors are watching the jobs data closely because the Fed has made it clear it will prioritise full employment over price stability objectives. Any sign that the economy is starting to overheat could prompt a dramatic volte-face as monetary policy is normalised at a faster rate than current market expectations imply. This raises the prospect of a renewed bout of market volatility later this year. 10-year US Treasury yields rose 3bps in the run-up to the release and are currently trading around 1.61%.”</p> </blockquote> <p>The surging US economy may increase pressure to end the federal government’s expanded $300/week unemployment benefits (as many <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2021/05/24/politics/florida-pandemic-unemployment-benefits/index.html\">Republican states have already done</a>), says <strong>Neil Birrell,</strong> <strong>Premier Miton </strong>Chief Investment Officer.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The initial jobless claims number came in better than expected.

Relative to the MPC’s central projection, I worry that the transition out of furlough does involve a modest rise in the unemployment rate, while the economy’s supply potential is somewhat less adversely affected, so that there is still some excess supply around the turn of the year.</p> <p>In that scenario, the first rise in Bank Rate is likely to become appropriate only well into next year, with some modest further tightening thereafter. </p> </blockquote> <p>However, a hike earlier in 2022 could be appropriate... <strong>if </strong>there is a smaller increase in job losses, putting upward pressure on inflation and wages, he adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On the upside, should the transition out of furlough happen more smoothly, with the unemployment rate at or a little below current levels by the end of the year, with associated signs of upward inflation and wage pressure beyond the temporary and base effects, then a somewhat earlier rise in Bank Rate would be appropriate.</p> <p>It would probably take until the first quarter of next year to have a clear view of the post-furlough unemployment and wage dynamics, so a rise in Bank Rate could be appropriate soon after, along a slightly steeper path than in my central case.</p> </blockquote> <p>This seems to have given sterling a lift - it’s now up half a cent at $1.4177 against the US dollar.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PriapusIQ/status/1397874277966352384\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">📈 GBP liking something, not sure anything Vlieghe said warrants the jolt higher though. <a href=\"https://t.co/TVuxFcDzZb\">pic.twitter.com/TVuxFcDzZb</a></p>&mdash; PiQ (@PriapusIQ) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PriapusIQ/status/1397874277966352384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 27, 2021</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The pound is also up around 0.3% against the euro, at €1.1616.</p> <p>Vlieghe’s MPC term ends in August, but these comments may also give an insight into how the committee are seeing the situation, points out DailyFX.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DailyFXTeam/status/1397875340719144964\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">While Vlieghe is leaving the BoE.

A low neutral interest rate will remain relevant once the Covid shock has passed. If anything, Covid may have lowered it by increasing the perception of tail risks.</p> <p>So if interest rates do need to rise once the data show that medium-term inflationary pressures are rising, then I suspect that interest rates will not need to rise very much to slow the economy to a pace that is consistent with our 2% inflation target. </p> </blockquote> <p>Here’s the speech:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bankofengland/status/1397877193615843336\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Gertjan Vlieghe talks about the rise in government bond yields.

Don’t you think that you should have been shown the red card for time wasting in the time of crisis in pursuit of this plan, which was really to shore up his own very lucrative personal interests? Sunak reiterates that he gave the right amount of time to the Greensill plan. Previous reports have suggested that Cameron was promised a stake of about 1% in Greensill for his advisory role. According to a recent investigation by my colleagues, that meant Cameron was looking at a windfall of about £200m in early 2020, based on plans to float the business at a valuation of £22bn before the Covid crisis hit. The former prime minister has refused to confirm how much he was paid or promised. in share options. Rishi Sunak says people shouldn’t read too much into his “turn of phrase” when he said he had “pushed the team” to consider Cameron and Greensill’s proposal to access the CCFF. Sunak says: It’s a really common phrase I would use on an almost daily or weekly basis, by talking about work that is being worked on in the department. It’s nothing more than a phrase. As a reminder, the original text, sent on 23 April 2020, read: Hi David, apologies for the delay. I think the proposals in the end did require a change to the Market Notice but I have pushed the team to explore an alternative with the Bank that might work No guarantees, but the Bank are currently looking at it and Charles should be in touch. Best, Rishi. MP Angela Eagle also takes issue with Sunak’s suggestion that greater transparency around lobbying is harmful for government: I was quite shocked that you seem to be making the argument that transparency on these matters, or in this case, discovered by good investigative journalism, will actually worsen outcomes. Surely transparency when it comes to lobbying especially in one’s own financial interests is absolutely crucial. Sunak defends his position: I completely agree transparency is important, that’s why we have a set of guidelines and frameworks in place that manage that. He repeats that the question is whether businesses are “less likely to want to engage with government if they feel there isn’t the space for private conversations.” Labour MP Angela Eagle is the next to lob questions at Sunak, and she gets straight to the point: Are you aware of how unusual it is for ex Prime Ministers to behave in this way lobbying in their direct financial interests so vociferously and so persistently? Sunak says Cameron can speak for himself, but says he isn’t aware of any similar circumstances. The deputy political editor at The Sun catches Sunak’s comments about his relationship with Cameron: Sunak says policy making process would be worse if business didn’t engage with government as a result of the Greensill scandal: And I would imagine this whole thing might change the way people feel about engaging with the government. He says some businesses might be more “reluctant to share private or positive thoughts with ministers” that could inform policy “if they think that can’t be private. If people feel that they can’t ... that will be enormous. They might backfire which would be disappointing and damaging to the policy process. Sunak agrees with his permanent secretaries that the direct costs to the taxpayer as a result of Greensill’s colapse will be around $8m. He will not confirm reports that the indirect exposure/costs could run upwards of £400m, based on government-backed loans extended to firms in Sanjeev Gupta’s GFG Alliance Group. If there was any doubt about where Rishi Sunak stands on the Greensill lobbying question: I stand very firmly by the approach we took. I think it was entirely right that we considered these proposals on their merits given the context, at the time. And I stand by the decision that we made not to take the proposals forward. Sunak denies that the Treasury allocated too much time to consider Greensill’s proposal, and played down any sense that it distracted from other work. My own view of the situation is that actually ...we spent the right amount of time on this situation to get to the right answer. And in the context of what was going on in the economy, it was absolutely right to be looking at ways to provide finance and credit and liquidity to small and medium sized companies He adds that compared to the preparation of CBILS, CLBILS and bounce back schemes, Greensill’s and Cameron’s queries were not requiring more energy than it warranted – despite the amount of public attention it’s attracted. Of all the things that we looked at to provide finance credit liquidity to small and medium sized companies, this probably occupied among the least amount of our time. It might look like that because all this attention on every email and everything else that is available, but of all the things we did....this occupied a very small amount of our time Chancellor Rishi Sunak says David Cameron’s involvement and lobbying was not a consideration when weighing the value of Greensill’s proposal to gain access to the CCFF. We look at the issue of it the issue on the merits, the identity of the person talking about it was not relevant to the amount of attention and proper diligence of the issue Sunak says that the issue front of mind was the plight of SMEs. That was a matter of enormous concern to me, and the department during this period. The first session is over, but Chancellor Rishi Sunak is up next. Labour MP Siobhain McDonagh asks Roxburgh: Were you aware when you were in your correspondence with David Cameron and LEx Greensill that Greensill’s biggest customer was under criminal investigation? She’s referring to the SFO investigation into Gupta’s majority-owned Wyelands, linked to his GFG Alliance group, which was one of Greensill’s largest customers. Roxburgh clarifies he didn’t have direct correspondence with Cameron, but reiterates that he did contact BEIS about the SFO probe and the information he did have. When asked whether that information was handed directly to the British British Business Bank, which was in charge of approving lenders like Greensill to distribute government-backed loans, the short answer is: no. Roxburgh says there are “very strict rules” about whether you can reveal that a criminal probe is underway. We did not disclose that further, because of these extraordinary strict rules. However, that low cost to taxpayers rests on the British Business Bank permanently cancelling the government guarantees on state-backed loans distributed by Greensill. CLBILS were 80% government-backed. As the Times’ economics editor explains: The BBB launched an investigation last autumn amid concerns over loans it distributed as part of the scheme, including those extended to firms across Sanjeev Gupta’s GFG Alliance. Lord Myners, who has been a critic of Greensill, previously told the Committee that the direct costs to taxpayers could run upwards of £1bn - and as high as £5bn when considering indirect costs. However, Roxburgh denies that figure. I do not know how Lord Myners came up with that number, we don’t recognise that. You’ll have to ask Lord Myners how he arrived at it. Instead, Roxburgh says the direct costs (as listed in the administration documents of Greensill Capital’s UK business) are as follows: $8m to HMRC and $168,000 to two local authorities $10,000 to one foundation trust He says some of that will be recovered, but roughly means the taxpayer could be on the hook for about £5m Scholar says the messages were wiped after the password was incorrectly entered too many times, locking the phone, sparking a reset that resulted in the rest of the messages being lost. The Mirror’s politics correspondent notes that Scholar’s record-keeping lesson comes in light of his text replies having been wiped: Scholar says the Treasury treated Greensill’s proposals with an “appropriate degree of scepticism” and decided there were other ways to help small businesses and supply chains. But when it comes to the lessons learned from this episode Scholar singles out ... record keeping: The main lesson to learn is the absolute paramount importance of following proper, correct procedures when going about our work. So giving proper objective impartial advice, keeping proper records of telephone conversations, making sure its all stored correctly...recording contacts from companies or people acting on behalf of companies He said he’s been stressing this to staff recently. Tom Scholar says it was “news to me” that David Cameron was working for Greensill when he was originally approached. However, he does not think he gave favourable treatment to Greensill as a result of Cameron’s involvement. He also played down their personal relationship. Roxburgh is asked whether he should have questioned Greensill about mounting concerns about its finances, following reports in papers including the FT. Roxburgh retorts that the Treasury ultimately rejected their application to access the CCFF. Roxburgh confirms that the chancellor Rishi Sunak was unlikely to have been aware of the foreign regulator’s warning about control failings at Greensill - referring to the German authority’s investigation. Roxburgh says he only became aware that Greensill had applied to become a lender through other schemes - including CBILS/CLBILS - from late April. They were accredited in June. Roxburgh says he does not know who they lent money to. However, he confirms the guarantees have been suspended as part of the British Business Bank’s investigation into Greensill’s lending as part of the government-backed scheme. Stride asks: Do you think there was more the Treasury could have done to avoid the British Business Bank getting into that situation in the first place? Roxburgh does not seem to agree. Roxburgh confirms he didn’t have any suspicions or concerns that there might have been looming issues around the Greensill’s finances. Greensill provided a list of companies that it expected would benefit from the scheme if it had access to the CCFF, as part of its application. But Roxburgh says he has gone back to that list and confirms no GFG Alliance firms were on it. Treasury Committee chair Mel Stride seems concerned about whether the Treasury was able to track the complex connections between Sanjeev Gupta’s GFG Alliance, the group’s Wyelands Bank - majority owned by the Liberty Steel boss – and Greensill, which was one of Gupta’s largest lenders. (Wyelands and Greensill Capital have ceased trading and Wyelands is the subject of an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office.) Stride says: So you didn’t join together ,at that point, the dots in terms of what was happening at Wyelands and GFG, [and] potential vulnerability on the part of Greensill? But Roxburgh insisted they did, and passed the information onto the business department “because it was relevant to them.” A reminder about the outcome of Cameron’s lobbying efforts, from Sky News’ business correspondent: Roxburgh admits that “quite a lot of people” were asking the Treasury to expand the CCFF (that’s the largest govt-backed Covid loan scheme), suggesting it wasn’t just Cameron pushing the point. However, it sounds like the questions were about involving non-investment grade companies in the scheme, rather than giving the money to a lender like Greensill, which hoped to use the money to lend onwards. That would have meant bending the CCFF’s mandate. (The scheme itself was meant to put money directly into big companies that needed help, not lenders who wanted to keep the money flowing to their own customers.) Roxburgh says he only became aware of the difficulties facing Greensill Bank in Germany in October 2020 - which at the time was under investigation over its exposure to Sanjeev Gupta’s GFG Alliance. They were notified via the foreign office, he says. The specific issues facing Greensill (presumably referring to their financial struggles after the lender had its insurance cover pulled), he says, only became clear in February this year. Treasury Committee chair Mel Stride gets straight to it, asking whether Charles Roxburgh, the Treasury’s second permanent secretary, had any concerns about Greensill’s finances when Cameron started lobbying ministers and officials on behalf of the lender back in early 2020. That was about a year before it fell into administration in March 2021. Roxburgh echoes what we heard from founder Lex Greensill and Cameron in previous sessions, which is that while there was “significant market stress”, there were no signs it was struggling itself: So we knew about their funding challenges in the market, but there was no evidence we had the Greensill corporate entity was facing financial difficulties Next up, Parliament’s Treasury Committee are holding further hearings as part of their inquiry into Greensill Capital, the collapsed supply chain finance company. At 2.30pm, they’ll hear from Sir Tom Scholar, Permanent Secretary, HM Treasury; and Charles Roxburgh, Second Permanent Secretary, HM Treasury. Then at 4pm, chancellor Rishi Sunak will answer questions. The hearing will look into former prime minister David Cameron’s lobbying for Greensill at the height of the pandemic, in an increasingly desperate attempt to ask the government to allow the lender to access the largest state-backed Covid loan scheme, the CCFF. That included messaging ministers and officials more than 50 times, including nine WhatsApp messages to Rishi Sunak, and 12 texts to Sir Tom Scholar. The committee say: In the first evidence session, the Committee is likely to examine how HM Treasury responded to lobbying from David Cameron, the supply chain finance industry, and what regulatory lessons can be drawn from the failure of Greensill Capital. In the second evidence session, the Committee is likely to ask how Mr Cameron’s lobbying of HM Treasury affected the Chancellor, the communications between Mr Cameron and the Chancellor, and the lessons for financial stability coming out of the failure of Greensill Capital. My colleague Kalyeena Makortoff, the Guardian’s banking correspondent, will track the action.... The drop in US jobless claims to 406,000 last week shows that America’s economy is strengthening as the Covid-19 vaccine rollout continues, says John Leiper, chief investment officer at Tavistock Wealth. Leiper adds that the jobs recovery could lead to more market jitters about interest rate rises. “With half of all Americans having now received at least one dose of Covid-19, and the ongoing easing of government restrictions, more businesses are re-opening every day. This is reflected in the number of initial jobless claims filed last week which fell to 406,000, below the consensus forecast of 425,000 and the prior week’s pandemic-era low of 444,000. Continuing claims, which have gone sideways for the last few weeks, came in marginally lower than expected at 3.642 million versus 3.68 expected and 3.751 during the prior week. Investors are watching the jobs data closely because the Fed has made it clear it will prioritise full employment over price stability objectives. Any sign that the economy is starting to overheat could prompt a dramatic volte-face as monetary policy is normalised at a faster rate than current market expectations imply. This raises the prospect of a renewed bout of market volatility later this year. 10-year US Treasury yields rose 3bps in the run-up to the release and are currently trading around 1.61%.” The surging US economy may increase pressure to end the federal government’s expanded $300/week unemployment benefits (as many Republican states have already done), says Neil Birrell, Premier Miton Chief Investment Officer. The initial jobless claims number came in better than expected. The demand for labour from business is spiking as the economy re-opens and there may even be a need to reduce the enhanced benefits for not working to avoid a labour shortage. An increase in wages would have the same effect but that would up fuel the pick-up in inflation. The overall story remains the same; the US economy is surging ahead.” The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefit has fallen to a fresh pandemic low, as firms look to hold onto staff as the economy strengthens. Just 406,000 new ‘initial claims’ were filed last week (on a seasonally-adjusted basis), down from 444,000 in the previous seven days. That suggests that fewer US firms are laying off workers this month, amid reports of labor shortages in some sectors as the economy reopens and Covid-19 cases fall. It is the smallest initial claims total since March 14, 2020, just before the first lockdown (when there were 256,000 initial claims). Ignoring seasonal adjustments, the initial claims total fell to 420,000 last week - also a pandemic low. Another 94,000 self-employed workers and freelancers sought help from the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program. That means the total number of new jobless claims has halved since mid March, as this chart from Daniel Zhao of Glassdoor shows: The US GDP report also shows that consumer spending, business investment and stimulus packages all drove the recovery: Here comes the flurry of US economic data... And first up, we have confirmation that America’s economy grew at a pacey 1.6% in the first quarter of this year (or 6.4% on an ‘annualised’ basis) That matches the initial estimate, up from 4.3% annualised growth, in October-December, as vaccine rollouts helped the US economy to expand. The BEA says it has revised up its forecasts for consumer spending and nonresidential fixed investment, but these are offset by downward revisions to exports and private inventory investment. Imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, were revised up, it adds. While the pound is rallying, the blue-chip FTSE 100 index has dipped today - down 13 points or 0.2% at 7013. Jet engine maker and services Rolls-Royce is still the top riser, now up 4.7%, as Airbus’s production plans boost sentiment. Melrose, which owns GKN Aerospace, are up 2.9%. Mining stocks, a gauge of global demand, are also higher following a pick-up in metals prices, with Glencore up 3.2%, BHP Group rising 3% and copper producer Antofagasta up 2.7%. Copper is being boosted by fears of supply problems, from possible strikes in Chile. And a drop in China’s industrial profits earlier today may be easing concerns that Beijing might tighten policy (hitting growth, and thus demand for commodities). Specialty chemicals manufacturer firm Johnson Matthey are down 3.1% after reporting a 22% drop in pretax profits, and plans to spend up to £600m this financial year boosting its investment in battery materials and hydrogen technology, for the growing electric vehicle market in Europe. Housebuilders are also weaker, along with multinationals such as tobacco firm Imperial Brands (-3.1%). The pound has jumped half a cent, after Bank of England policymaker Gertjan Vlieghe suggested that UK interest rates could rise sometime early next year. In a lecture at the University of Bath, Vlieghe said his central forecast is that the first rate rise (from the current record low of 0.1%) would come “well into” 2022, given unemployment is likely to rise as the furlough scheme ends. Vlieghe, who is one of the external members of the Monetary Policy Committee, says: My central scenario is that the economy evolves similarly to the MPC’s central projection in May, but with somewhat more slack than in the central projection. Relative to the MPC’s central projection, I worry that the transition out of furlough does involve a modest rise in the unemployment rate, while the economy’s supply potential is somewhat less adversely affected, so that there is still some excess supply around the turn of the year. In that scenario, the first rise in Bank Rate is likely to become appropriate only well into next year, with some modest further tightening thereafter. However, a hike earlier in 2022 could be appropriate... if there is a smaller increase in job losses, putting upward pressure on inflation and wages, he adds: On the upside, should the transition out of furlough happen more smoothly, with the unemployment rate at or a little below current levels by the end of the year, with associated signs of upward inflation and wage pressure beyond the temporary and base effects, then a somewhat earlier rise in Bank Rate would be appropriate. It would probably take until the first quarter of next year to have a clear view of the post-furlough unemployment and wage dynamics, so a rise in Bank Rate could be appropriate soon after, along a slightly steeper path than in my central case. This seems to have given sterling a lift - it’s now up half a cent at $1.4177 against the US dollar. The pound is also up around 0.3% against the euro, at €1.1616. Vlieghe’s MPC term ends in August, but these comments may also give an insight into how the committee are seeing the situation, points out DailyFX. Vlieghe also warned that new Covid-19 variants could slow the recovery (as our Covid Crisis Watch series warned). That could prompt new stimulus - which could include negative interest rates. He says: On the downside, the economy might not recover as quickly, perhaps as lingering concerns about “variants of concern” continue to weigh on demand, which in turn results in more adverse unemployment dynamics as fewer furloughed workers are hired back straight away, with weaker underlying wage pressure. In that case, it is still possible that monetary policy might be required to simulate the economy a little further to help eliminate slack and ensure inflation, after its temporary rise later this year, does not subsequently fall back below its 2% target persistently. This chart from Vlieghe’s speech shows how these scenarios could play out: Vlieghe also points out that the “neutral rate of interest” (the rate at which monetary policy is neither stimulating nor slowing the economy) is very low relative to the past several decades, and probably even lower due to the pandemic. In other words, rates are unlikely to rise significantly to keep inflation on target, he explains: That was apparent before we were hit by the Covid shock, when Bank Rate was just 0.75% and inflation pressures were too weak. A low neutral interest rate will remain relevant once the Covid shock has passed. If anything, Covid may have lowered it by increasing the perception of tail risks. So if interest rates do need to rise once the data show that medium-term inflationary pressures are rising, then I suspect that interest rates will not need to rise very much to slow the economy to a pace that is consistent with our 2% inflation target. Here’s the speech: UK bed and mattress retailer Dreams is being bought by US bedding giant Tempur Sealy in a £340 deal, from private equity Sun European Partners. The deal comes eight years after Sun took Dreams out of administration for £23m, after it collapsed with the loss of 400 jobs. Since then, CEO Mike Logue has been pushing a turnaround plan - pitching Dreams as an ‘sleep experts’, and also introducing smaller, brighter stores, new fleet of delivery vans and a sizeable investment in ecommerce. Logue says the deal is a ‘milestone’ for Dreams. “We are delighted to be joining the Tempur Sealy family. Today marks a milestone for Dreams. It is recognition of the transformation we have delivered, and is an endorsement of our customer-focused strategy, our culture and our values. With Tempur Sealy we expect to drive our growth strategy and build on our position as the most recommended, specialist bed retailer. I would like to take this opportunity to thank our 2,000 colleagues for their hard work, dedication and commitment. Together we will continue to improve what we make, sell and deliver, to provide better sleep for all our customers.” Here’s George MacDonald of Retail Week on the deal: Airbus has told suppliers it is planning for record production of its bestselling planes within two years in a sign of the manufacturer’s hopes for a belated but strong recovery for aviation from the coronavirus pandemic. The European manufacturer said on Thursday it would increase production of A320 single-aisle aircraft to 45 per month by October, up from 40. However, it said suppliers should be ready for a rate of 64 per month by the spring of 2023 for the A320, which is well suited to short-haul travel that is expected to bounce back the quickest. That would beat its previous highest rate target of 63, and would be followed by 70 per month at the start of 2024 and as high as 75 by 2025. The aerospace industry has endured months of weak demand for planes during the pandemic as airline customers cut back on orders as their revenues dried up. Airbus and its US rival, Boeing, together cut tens of thousands of jobs worldwide as demand plummeted. Demand for Boeing planes was hit further by the crisis over its previously top-selling 737 Max, which was grounded for over a year after two fatal crashes caused by malfunctions. There is still confusion over when people across the world will be allowed to travel for tourism purposes. Airline and holiday firm bosses on Wednesday attacked the UK government’s “utterly confusing” advice on foreign travel. However, aerospace analysts have long expected demand for air travel – alongside the sector’s carbon emissions – to overtake pre-pandemic levels rapidly once vaccines start to diminish the risks of the coronavirus. In the long term, the growth of the middle class in Asia and Africa is expected to continue the structural growth in flight number. Here’s the full story: Here’s more reaction to Airbus’s plan to boost aircraft production, particularly for its A320 jet. The BBC points out that Airbus’s plans could benefit Northern Ireland: Airbus has said it envisages producing 14 of its A220 airliners every month within the next five years. The wings for the A220 are made at the Spirit AeroSystems plant in Belfast. The current monthly production rate is five, which Airbus has said will increase to six early next year. Boris Johnson has been warned by business leaders that a fresh package of economic support would be required if rising Covid-19 infections prevent the further relaxation of pandemic restrictions next month, my colleague Richard Partington explains. After the reopening of hospitality venues indoors across all four nations of the UK, the Guardian’s latest monthly assessment of economic developments suggests the country is on course for a short-term growth boom this summer. Retail sales have surged above pre-pandemic levels, while customers returning to restaurants, pubs and cafes have driven a sharp rise in consumer spending to begin repairing the damage from the worst recession in 300 years. However, concerns are mounting over the Covid variant first detected in India – B.1.617.2 – and the possibility that rising infections could delay the next phase of the government’s roadmap for relaxing controls in England. Here’s the full story: Here’s Reuters’s take on the jump in restaurant booking last week: British diners flocked to restaurants over the past week after lockdown restrictions lifted across most of the United Kingdom, and the number of furloughed workers fell to its lowest since the start of the year, weekly official data showed. The figures add to signs that economic life is returning to normal as lockdown restrictions ease following the roll-out of COVID vaccines which now cover more than 70% of the adult population. Britain’s government closed pubs, restaurants and non-essential retailers at the start of the year due to the spread of a more infectious variant of COVID, and significant reopening only started in late April. Restaurants in England, Scotland and Wales were allowed to serve customers indoors from May 17, after several weeks when outdoor dining was allowed. Bookings in the first full week of opening, ending May 24, were 32% above their level in the same period of 2019, before the pandemic, according to data from booking website OpenTable produced for the Office for National Statistics. This chart shows how UK online job adverts have now risen to 18% above their pre-pandemic level. It highlights how firms are look to hire more staff to handle rising demand - particularly in transport and logistics, and construction. But, as Adzuna point out, graduate job opportunities are lagging behind: The proportion of workers on furlough has fallen to its lowest level this year, as the UK economy emerges from lockdown. New figures from the ONS shows that 8% of the workforce were furloughed in the two weeks to May 16, the lowest total seen so far in 2021. That equates to around 2.2m, and is down from 10% around the start of the month. The report also shows a surge in people returning to restaurants since indoor dining was allowed again last week. Restaurant bookings in the week to Monday May 24th were 32% higher than their level two years earlier, as people took the opportunity to eat out indoors again. Firms are also posting more online job adverts - a sign that the economy is picking up as restrictions are relaxed. Online job adverts on 21 May 2021 were 18% higher than the average in February 2020 - an increase of 4 percentage points on last week, according to data from Adzuna. The largest weekly increase was for “transport, logistics and warehouse” jobs, which surged 21 percentage points to 275% of its February 2020 average level -- the highest level since the series began in February 2018. Manufacturers also posted more job adverts - up 14 percentage points week-on-week, to 231% of its February 2020 average level. But “catering and hospitality” saw a small dip, down 2 percentage points on last week, to around 113% of its February 2020 average. The ONS adds: This follows a recent upward trend for this category, having risen by 55 percentage points since 9 April 2021, just before the first easing of hospitality restrictions when pubs and restaurants reopened in England. Top US and Chinese trade negotiators held “candid” talks today, their first under the Biden presidency, as Washington continues to raise concerns over Beijing’s trade practices. In the long-awaited first official engagement between the US trade representative Katherine Tai and the Chinese vice-premier, Liu He, held virtually on Thursday morning Beijing time, the two sides emphasised the importance of the bilateral trade relations and agreed to further negotiations. A statement from China’s commerce ministry said the US and China held “candid, pragmatic and constructive exchanges with an attitude of equality and mutual respect”. In Washington, the office of the US trade representative said that Tai “discussed the guiding principles of the Biden-Harris administration’s worker-centred trade policy and her ongoing review of the US-China trade relationship, while also raising issues of concern.” Here’s the full story: The pandemic has hit profits at the publisher of the Daily Mail, although its investment in online car retailer Cazoo is more than cushioning the blow. Pre-tax profits at Daily Mail and General Trust fell 45% in the six months to the end of March to £42m, down from £77m a year earlier. Revenues dropped to £547m, from £642m. While its business-to-business information service grew revenues and profits, its events and exhibitions arm suffered a 95% drop in revenues amid the lockdown. The consumer media businesses (which includes the Daily Mail, Mailonline, Metro and the ‘i’) saw revenues drop 10% amid a volatile advertising market. DMGT’s 20% stake in used car seller Cazoo - which is floating in New York - is valued at $1.35bn, or around £957m. That means an eight-fold return on DMGT’s total investment of £117m, after it invested another £34m in Cazoo last October. CEO Paul Zwillenberg said: Our financial flexibility enabled us to continue to invest in Cazoo through multiple funding rounds. Despite the near-term economic uncertainty, we had conviction in its opportunity to transform the used car market. Cazoo continues to go from strength to strength and its proposed SPAC combination on the New York Stock Exchange would value our stake at US$1.35bn, a return of eight times on our capital. Shares in DMGT are up 3.3% this morning. Rolls-Royce, the jet engine maker, is leading the FTSE 100 risers this morning - up 3% - as Airbus’s announcement lifts the sector. Warren East, Rolls-Royce’s CEO, told Radio 4’s Today Programme that predicting the precise timing of the recovery was very difficult. East also points out that Covid-19 will have a permanent impact on the sector: The pandemic will undoubtedly change certain behaviours, and that’s reflected in our expectation of a smaller market in future than we would have expected pre-Covid. But we absolutely expect continued growth, because aviation is such an important part of the world economy. East was speaking as Rolls-Royce opened its new £90m engine testbed at its Derby factory. The largest in the world (bigger than a football pitch, apparently), it will test new engines before they’re put into service. While the pandemic has hit air travel, it has also created a boom in pet ownership. UK retailer Pets at Home has achieved sales of more than £1bn for the first time, as more people have turned to furry, feathered and scaled friends in the lockdown. My colleague Jasper Jolly explains: The retailer and vet chain estimated that pet numbers increased by 8% during a year in which many people were stuck at home. The boom has led to pet food shortages. The pandemic “structurally altered the dynamics of the UK pet care market”, the company said, with increased home working removing a barrier to pet ownership and increasing the emotional attachment to – and willingness to spend on – animals. Pets at Home revenues grew by 7.9% to £1.1bn in the year to 25 March, which coincided almost exactly with the start of the UK’s lockdowns. That was a record in the company’s 30-year history. It said there had been a pet “baby boom”. Sales of kitten and puppy products surged by 37% and 26% respectively, with training products and heated puppy beds in particular demand. Even less cuddly fish tank sales increased. The global rollout of Covid-19 vaccines is lifting future demand for travel, as economies reopen and tourism picks up. So aircraft bosses need to take decisions now if they want suppliers to be ready for higher output in future. The FT’s Sylvia Pfeifer explains: The outlook for a longer-term recovery in aviation has improved with the global rollout of vaccines despite regional flare-ups. One of the biggest challenges for the industry is ensuring that its long, intricate supply chains are ready to ramp up production to meet the expected demand. Reuters says Airbus has laid out ‘sweeping goals’ to expand production of its A320 jetliners over the next few years (initially from 40 per month today to 45 by the end of the year, and 64 per month by Q2 2023). Demand for single-aisle jets is recovering as domestic travel rebounds, especially in the United States and China. In anticipation of a continued recovery in that market, Airbus is asking its suppliers to “enable a scenario” where it can produce 70 single-aisle jets a month by the first quarter of 2024. “Longer term, Airbus is investigating opportunities for rates as high as 75 (a month) by 2025,” it said. Analysts at Jefferies described the move by Boeing’s main rival as “punchy production plans”. Airbus is telling suppliers to prepare for an ‘aggressive ramp up’ of jet production, explains Richard Schuurman, aviation reporter for Air Insight. Airbus has boosted optimism for a global aviation recovery by alerting its suppliers prepare for a sharp increase in A320 production, says Bloomberg: Airbus SE is preparing to gear up production of its best-selling A320-series jets beyond pre-pandemic levels within two years, lending a jolt of optimism for a recovery in global aviation. The shares jumped after the world’s largest producer of commercial jetliners told suppliers to be ready to raise output of its top-selling narrow-body to a rate of 64 per month by the second quarter of 2023. That figure could rise to 70 a month early the following year and could reach 75 by 2025, Airbus said in a statement Thursday. The ambitious plan stands out in an industry that’s still struggling to gain traction after the Covid-19 pandemic wiped out demand for air travel. Despite short-term flareups in the outbreak, the longer-term picture has brightened with the global rollout of vaccines. Airbus and its U.S. rival Boeing Co. have been showing more confidence even as pressure to lower emissions presents the next challenge for the industry. Shares in Airbus have jumped around 6% in early trading in Paris, as investors welcome its plans to boost production output over the next few years. They’re currently up €5.7 at €103.4, close to April’s one-year high. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After seeing demand battered by the pandemic, aerospace manufacturer Airbus says the recovery is beginning. It’s alerted its suppliers to prepare for a steep acceleration in production of its popular A320 single-aisle passenger jets, as it sets target above pre-pandemic levels in two years time. The European aerospace group has confirmed plans to increase A320 output to 45 jets per month in the last quarter of this year, from 40 at present. It has also set suppliers a new target -- 64 a month by the second quarter of 2023, and wants to ensure it has the long term capacity in place. That’s above the 60/month peak it hit in 2019, before Covid-19. Airbus says it expect the commercial aircraft market to recover to pre-COVID levels between 2023 and 2025, led by the single-aisle segment. Guillaume Faury, Airbus CEO, says this morning: “The aviation sector is beginning to recover from the COVID-19 crisis” Looking further ahead, Airbus is anticipating a “continued recovering market”. It also asking suppliers to “ enable a scenario” for production to expand further to 70 by the first quarter of 2024. And long term, it’s also investigating whether it could boost production to 75 by 2025. This steep ramp up looks like a sign of confidence in the recovery of the aviation industry from the pandemic - with Covid-19 vaccinations enabling a pick-up in international tourism. Faury says Airbus wants its suppliers to be ready for the pick-up in demand. “The message to our supplier community provides visibility to the entire industrial ecosystem to secure the necessary capabilities and be ready when market conditions call for it. In parallel, we are transforming our industrial system by optimising our aerostructures set-up and modernising our A320 Family production facilities. All these actions are set in motion to prepare our future.” Airbus is also slightly increasing its production goals for its small A220 jet, and the wide-body A350 - again, in a mix of provisional goals and firm plans. A220 Family: Currently at around rate five aircraft per month from Mirabel and Mobile, the rate is confirmed to rise to around six in early 2022. Airbus is also envisaging a monthly production rate of 14 by the middle of the decade. A350 Family: Currently at an average production rate of five per month, this is expected to increase to six by autumn 2022. A330 Family: Production remains at an average monthly production rate of two per month. Also coming up today Big Oil is reeling from a series of blows yesterday, over their failure to move faster to tackle the climate emergency. US oil giants ExxonMobil and Chevron both suffered shareholder rebellions, with 61% of Chevron shareholders supporting a resolution to set targets to reduce all of its emissions. Activist hedge fund Engine No. 1 got two directors elected to the board of ExxonMobil. And in a landmark case in the Hague, a Dutch court ruled that Royal Dutch Shell must reduce its global carbon emissions by 45% by the end of 2030. Dan Gocher, Director of Climate &amp; Environment at the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR) says these developments have “massive implications”. “This news is nothing short of extraordinary, and it will have massive implications for the Australian oil and gas industry. “Chevron, ExxonMobil and Shell are three of Australia’s largest oil and gas producers, and therefore three of our largest carbon polluters. “All three companies will now be under enormous pressure from both shareholders and the wider public to cut emissions, and cut them fast. European markets are rather subdued, after a lacklustre day’s trading in Asia which saw Japan’s Nikkei drop 0.3% and the Hong Kong Hang Seng dip 0.2%. Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst for Asia Pacific at OANDA, says: Some of the week’s froth has come out of the markets in Asia today, with equities edging lower, along with energy and precious metals and our good friends, the cryptocurrency space, while the US Dollar edged higher after an impressive rally overnight. All the financial markets space, the price action looks corrective, rather than a structural turn, as short-term momentum ran out of the “inflation is dead, buy everything” that has swept markets this week.

Asked about Senate Republicans’ latest counteroffer in the infrastructure negotiations, Biden said he had a brief but positive conversation with Senator Shelley Moore Capito about the new proposal. “I haven’t had a chance yet to go over the details of the counteroffer made by Capito,” Biden said. “We’re going to meet sometime next week, and we’ll see if we can move that.” Echoing Senate Democrats, the president emphasized the need to wrap up the infrastructure negotiations in the coming weeks. “I told her we have to finish this really soon,” Biden said. “We’re going to have to close this down soon.” Some Senate Democrats are already pushing to use reconciliation to pass an infrastructure bill, thus avoiding a potential Republican filibuster of the legislation. The family of Officer Brian Sicknick met with several Republican senators as the Senate prepares to vote on the bill to establish a bipartisan commission to study the Capitol insurrection. One of those senators, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, said in a statement that he offered his condolences to the family of Sicknick, the US Capitol Police officer who died of a stroke the day after the January 6 insurrection. In his statement, Johnson emphasized that the insurrectionists “should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law,” but he did not agree with the family on the need for a commission to study the attack. “Although we respectfully disagreed on the added value of the proposed commission, I did commit to doing everything I could to ensure all their questions will be answered,” Johnson said. Senate Republicans are poised to use the filibuster to defeat the commission bill, which passed the House last week. The family of Officer Brian Sicknick is on Capitol Hill today, meeting with senators and pushing them to support establishing a bipartisan commission to study the January 6 insurrection. Sicknick was a US Capitol Police officer who died the day after the insurrection. He collapsed shortly after clashing with rioters, and he later died at a nearby hospital. A medical examiner said last month that Sicknick died after suffering two strokes. Asked how she felt listening to Republicans who oppose establishing a commission, Gladys Sicknick, the mother of Brian Sicknick, told reporters, “This is why I’m here today. I mean, usually I’ll stay in the background, and I just couldn’t stay quiet anymore.” Senator Joe Manchin indicated he was not open to eliminating the filibuster in order to get the January 6 commission bill passed. “I’m not willing to destroy our government, no,” the Democratic senator told reporters on Capitol Hill. Manchin added, “I think we’ll come together. You have to have faith there’s 10 good people.” According to CNN, Senate Republican leaders are confident they have the votes necessary to defeat the commission bill today. Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer lamented that the January 6 commission bill cannot secure widespread bipartisan support in Congress. Reflecting on how the “big lie” of widespread election fraud in the presidential election has overtaken the Republican party, Schumer said the country must put a stop to this “cancer” in the GOP. The Democratic leader specifically criticized Republican legislators in Arizona for “chasing a bananas-crazy right-wing Internet conspiracy” that China tampered with ballots to swing the election to Joe Biden. “We need to stand up to the big lie,” Schumer said. “We must get at the truth and do everything in our power to restore Americans faith in our elections and this grand, ongoing, noble experiment of democracy.” With that goal in mind, Schumer said a bipartisan commission to study the Capitol insurrection is “exactly what the doctor ordered”. Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell dismissed the idea of forming a bipartisan commission to study the Capitol insurrection, arguing that such a panel would be “extraneous” to the current investigations underway at the justice department and in Congress. McConnell’s comments in a Senate floor speech this morning came as Republicans prepared to block the House-approved bill to convene a January 6 commission. If Republicans do block the bill, it may mark the first official use of the Senate filibuster in this session of Congress. “There’s no new fact about that day we need the Democrats’ extraneous commission to uncover,” McConnell said moments ago. The Republican leader noted that more than 440 people have already been arrested in connection to the Capitol insurrection and the attorney general has promised to maintain the investigation of the attack as a top priority for the justice department. Democrats have pointed out that much remains unknown about the Capitol attack, including some insurrectionists’ potential ties to Republican lawmakers. “I do not believe the additional extraneous commission that Democratic leaders want would uncover crucial new facts or promote healing,” McConnell said. “Frankly, I do not believe it is even designed to do that.” McConnell added, “I’ll continue to urge my colleagues to oppose this extraneous layer when the time comes for the Senate to vote.” Democratic Senator Bob Casey signaled this morning that it may be time to move on from negotiating with Republicans and instead pass an infrastructure bill using reconciliation, allowing Democrats to circumvent the Senate filibuster. Asked whether it was time to focus on setting up a reconciliation pathway for the infrastructure bill, Casey told CNN anchor Jim Sciutto, “I think we’re getting to that point, Jim. It’s an old expression, fish or cut bait.” Casey said Joe Biden had done “really good work here to engage Republican senators,” but he argued it was time for negotiations to come to a conclusion. “I do think we’re getting to the last chapter of this,” Casey said. “Now the last chapter could result in an agreement, but it could also result in no agreement.” Casey expressed a desire to move on to Democrats’ “next set of agenda items,” like funding universal pre-kindergarten and two years of community college for American families. The Guardian’s Sam Levine and Daniel Strauss report: After six months of aggressive Republican efforts to restrict voting access, Democrats are facing new questions about how they will actually pass voting rights reforms through Congress. The most recent hand-wringing comes as Joe Manchin, the West Virginia Democratic senator, made clear earlier this month he still is not on board with the For the People Act, which would require early voting, automatic and same-day registration, and prevent the severe manipulation of district boundaries for partisan gain. Senate Democrats, including Manchin, met privately on Wednesday to map out a path forward on the bill, which has already passed the US House. Senator Raphael Warnock of Georgia said: “I think members of the caucus understand the urgency and we’re focused on getting something passed. We have an obligation to the American people to find a way to protect our democracy.” Manchin’s opposition comes at a critical moment when there is escalating concern about aggressive state Republican efforts to curtail access to the ballot. Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Iowa and Montana have all put new restrictions in place this year. Many see this as an existential moment for the Democratic party and fear that Republicans will permanently reap the benefits of a distorted electoral system if Democrats cannot pass federal legislation. There is heightened urgency to act quickly so that crucial protections can be in place when the once-per-decade redistricting process gets under way later this year. Senator Joe Manchin has released a statement fiercely criticizing his Republican colleagues for opposing the bill to create a 9/11-style commission to study the Capitol insurrection. “There’s no excuse for any Republican to vote against this commission since Democrats have agreed to everything they asked for,” the Democratic senator said. Singling out the Senate minority leader, Manchin said, “Mitch McConnell has made this his political position, thinking it will help his 2022 elections. They do not believe the truth will set you free, so they continue to live in fear.” Senate Republicans are poised to block the passage of the 6 January commission bill using the filibuster, which requires 60 votes for approval. The question now becomes whether Manchin would be willing to scrap the filibuster to get the commission bill through the Senate. Manchin has been a fierce defender of the filibuster, and he has previously indicated he is not willing to eliminate it. Moments after Senate Republicans concluded their press conference, one of their Democratic colleagues offered some criticism of their latest infrastructure proposal. “I don’t really think this is a serious counteroffer,” Senator Elizabeth Warren told MSNBC. The Democratic senator added that the Republicans’ proposal to redirect unused coronavirus relief funds toward infrastructure would not win any fans in the White House. Shelley Moore Capito argued that Senate Republicans and Joe Biden are actually closer on an infrastructure deal than their topline numbers would suggest. The Republican senator said she believed they could reach an agreement if Biden removed funding for issues like elder care and green energy from his plan, which would bring them much closer to an agreed-upon cost for the bill. “I think the gaps are much less,” Capito told reporters. However, Biden has consistently argued that the green energy sector and the care economy are critical parts of American infrastructure and must be included in this bill. Something else to keep in mind: most of the latest Republican plan reflects baseline spending on infrastructure items. The baseline number indicates how much the US will spend on infrastructure if the current level of activity continues, adjusting for inflation. The $928 billion figure actually includes only $257 billion in new infrastructure spending over that baseline number. That works out to spending an additional $32 billion or so on infrastructure in each of the next eight years, which will not likely please Joe Biden and his team. It’s also important to keep in mind that much of the spending proposed by Senate Republicans comes from unused coronavirus relief funds. Joe Biden and his team have indicated they are not at all pleased with the idea of redirecting coronavirus relief money to infrastructure. But Republicans have said they are adamantly opposed to rolling back the Trump-era tax cuts to pay for the infrastructure plan, which is what Biden originally proposed. Shelley Moore Capito said Senate Republicans’ latest $928 billion infrastructure offer is “sticking with the core elements of infrastructure”. The Republican negotiators have consistently clashed with Joe Biden over how to define infrastructure as it relates to items that will be included in this massive bill. For example, the president and his team have proposed massive investments in the green energy sector, but Republicans have been far less inclined to include that funding in this bill. Senate Republicans are now formally introducing their counteroffer to Joe Biden’s infrastructure plan at a press conference on Capitol Hill. The Republican negotiating team, led by Senator Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, is calling for spending $928bn over eight years to strengthen America’s infrastructure systems. That proposal includes an increase of $91bn to improve roads and bridges and $48bn more to invest in water infrastructure. “Senate Republicans continue to negotiate in good faith,” Capito said. “We’re trying to get to that common goal of reaching a bipartisan infrastructure agreement.” However, the new Republican proposal is still far less than the $1.7tn plan that Joe Biden’s team outlined in their counteroffer last week. Greetings from Washington, live blog readers. Senate Republicans will soon hold a press conference on Capitol Hill to introduce their latest counteroffer to Joe Biden’s infrastructure plan. The new Republican plan is expected to cost around $1tn, which is nearly double the cost of their initial infrastructure proposal. However, $1tn would still be far less than what the president has called for spending. Biden originally outlined a $2.25tn plan, but he counteroffered with a $1.7tn proposal last week. According to reports, Biden indicated to Senate Republicans in a meeting last week that he would be comfortable with $1tn as the topline number for an infrastructure bill. However, at that cost, many items will probably be left out of the final legislation, which could frustrate Democrats, some of whom are pushing to pass the bill using reconciliation and thus bypass Senate Republicans. If Biden rejects the latest Republican offer, reconciliation may be the only way to get an infrastructure bill passed. The Republican press conference will begin in about 20 minutes, so stay tuned.","charCount":"13107","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/joan-greve\">Joan E Greve</a> in Washington"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2021/may/27/chris-deane-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-27T16:30:17Z","webTitle":"Chris Deane obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/may/27/chris-deane-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2021/may/27/chris-deane-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Chris Deane obituary","trailText":"<strong>Other lives:</strong> Former headteacher who stood as a Labour candidate at local elections in Kent","byline":"Mick Nott","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"48196af95bc033ca7d72960eea26e87459d0601a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48196af95bc033ca7d72960eea26e87459d0601a/0_244_663_398/500.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Deane was an enthusiastic left-leaning teacher.

He was visiting a hospital in Colchester, and what was striking was how soft his response to Dominic Cummings was.</p> \n  <p>Although there was an ultra-generalised rejection of some of what Cummings was saying - “some of the commentary I’ve heard doesn’t bear any relation to reality” - Johnson did not accuse his former aide of lying (even about a claim Johnson has previously denied 100%). And although he rejected what Cummings said about tens of thousands of people dying unnecessarily, he did so in an understated way (“I don’t think so”).</p> \n  <p>This may be because No 10 does not have the evidence to refute Cummings’ claims, because they were accurate. But it may also reflect a desire to de-escalate the story, and to avoid provoking Cummings any further.</p> \n  <p>Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson rejected the claim made by Dominic Cummings that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2021/may/26/uk-covid-news-live-dominic-cummings-boris-johnson-covid-evidence-pmqs?page=with:block-60ae48c88f086d71cc15b42f#block-60ae48c88f086d71cc15b42f\">tens of thousands of people died unnecessarily</a> because of mistakes made by the government.</strong> He also repeated his longstanding claim that the government followed the scientific advice. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>At every stage we’ve been governed by a determination to protect life, to save life, and to ensure that our NHS is not overwhelmed. And we’ve followed to the best we can the data and the guidance we’ve had.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But yesterday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2021/may/26/uk-covid-news-live-dominic-cummings-boris-johnson-covid-evidence-pmqs?page=with:block-60ae56eb8f086d71cc15b556#block-60ae56eb8f086d71cc15b556\">Cummings set out in detail how Johnson ignored scientific advice in September to order a second lockdown. </a>This has been very well documented, and is not seriously contested.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson sought to draw a line under the controversy about whether or not he said he would rather see “bodies pile high” than order a third lockdown.</strong> In the Commons last month <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-56914432\">Johnson denied making that comment, or remarks to that effect.</a> But yesterday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2021/may/26/uk-covid-news-live-dominic-cummings-boris-johnson-covid-evidence-pmqs?page=with:block-60ae59dc8f088d8c31789cd1#block-60ae59dc8f088d8c31789cd1\">Cummings said he heard the PM say it.</a> Asked today if he did say he would rather see “bodies pile high” than order a third lockdown, Johnson replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I have already made my position very clear on that point. I’m getting on with the job of delivering the road map that I think is the sensible way forward.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked if Cummings was telling the truth, Johnson sidestepped the question. Asked if that meant he was not contesting with what Cummings said, Johnson replied: “I make no comment on that.” </p> \n  <p>Viewers might conclude that, if Johnson did not say that remark, or anything to the same effect, he might be denying it more forcefully.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson said the government did “everything we could” to protect care homes. </strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He claimed that some of Cummings’ evidence was wrong - without giving details.</strong> Asked if Cummings was right to say Johnson was not fit to lead the country, Johnson replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think that it’s important for us to focus on what really matters to the people in this country and I think, if I may say so, that some of the commentary I’ve heard doesn’t bear any relation to reality and what people want us to get on with is delivering the roadmap and trying, cautiously, to take our country forward through what has been one of the most difficult periods that I think anybody can remember.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said he could not see anything currently in the data to suggest the planned lifting of remaining restrictions in England on 21 June would have to be delayed.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said the government had always expected cases to rise around now.</strong> But the government was still looking at the data to see quite what effect the vaccines were having on keeping people out of hospital, he said.

That was the clear takeaway from his performance in the Commons just now. That is not because he has refuted (proved wrong) all or any of the allegations Dominic Cummings made about him in his select committee evidence yesterday. Most of them he did not even rebut (claim to be wrong), because as far as he could he refused to engage with the substance of what Cummings said. But Conservative MPs gave him the most solid support he could hope for, which went well beyond loyalist sycophants asking suck-up questions at the behest of the whips. Cummings was famously contemptuous of most MPs (even Brexity ones), and the feeling seems to be heartily reciprocated. Tory MPs feel much more warmly towards Hancock, and almost all of the ones who spoke showed zero interest in re-opening a debate about who in government said what when, despite the immense significance of the decisions taken.</p> \n  <p>Even Jeremy Hunt, the chair of the health committee, who has generally been a shrewd critic of government policy, and who is running an inquiry specifically intended to get to the truth of what happened, spoke about the Cummings allegations about Hancock with disdain. Until there was “evidence”, they were “unproven”, he said (see<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2021/may/27/uk-covid-live-news-cummings-wrong-to-say-tens-of-thousands-died-needlessly-minister-says?page=with:block-60af6a938f086d71cc15c300#block-60af6a938f086d71cc15c300\"> 10.49am)</a> - as if Cummings telling MPs that he was in the room when he heard these things being said wasn’t evidence.</p> \n  <p>But it was telling that on the one Cummings allegation on which he was repeatedly questioned - that he told colleagues patients would be tested before being discharged into care homes, when in fact that did not happen - Hancock studiously avoided denying the claim. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2021/may/27/uk-covid-live-news-cummings-wrong-to-say-tens-of-thousands-died-needlessly-minister-says?page=with:block-60af6ece8f08d486a7714877#block-60af6ece8f08d486a7714877\">11.07am.)</a> Some of the other allegations made by Cummings did not even come up at all.

He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It’s now in well over the majority of local authority areas in the country and is now the dominant strain. The majority of new cases are of the variant - that is obviously concerning. It’s gone from being really a small minority a month ago to the majority variant.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Ferguson said this meant that whether or not England would be able to go ahead with step 4 of the roadmap - the lifting of all remaining restrictions - was “in the balance”. He explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Step 4 is rather in the balance, the data collected in the next two to three weeks will be critical.</p> \n   <p>The key issue as to whether we can go forward is: will the surge caused by the Indian variant - and we do think there will be a surge - be more than has been already planned in to the relaxation measures?</p> \n   <p>So it was always expected that relaxation would lead to a surge in infections and to some extent a small third wave of transmission - that’s inevitable if you allow contact rates in population to go up, even despite immunity - [but] we can’t cope with that being too large.</p> \n   <p>In the next two or three weeks we will be able to come to a firm assessment of whether it’s possible to go forward.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Ferguson also restated his claim that locking down a week early in March 2020 would have saved 20,000 to 30,000 lives.

Today will be dominated by Matt Hancock, the health secretary, responding to the multiple criticisms of him made by Dominic Cummings, the prime minister’s former chief adviser, in his select committee evidence yesterday - Hancock is in the Commons this morning, and holding a press conference this afternoon - but Cummings did not just criticise Hancock, and it is for the government as a whole to respond too.</p> \n  <p><strong>Robert Jenrick</strong>, the communities secretary, was doing the morning interview round and he made it clear that the government is taking a dual-pronged approach. Broadly, it is not going to engage with Cummings, Jenrick implied, because he said the government wanted to wait until the inquiry, which is not due to start until next year. Jenrick said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The last year has been uniquely challenging and difficult for everyone in ways, but very, very profoundly difficult for those people who’ve lost loved ones and they are right to seek answers and explanations. That’s why we’re having the full public inquiry next year.</p> \n   <p>I think that is the right moment to consider these things in a calm and reflective manner with all of the evidence. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But ministers are responding to some of Cummings’ allegations and Jenrick said he did not believe probably the most damning one of all - that “tens of thousands of people died who didn’t need to die”. Asked if Cummings was wrong to make this claim, Jenrick replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Yes, I think it is because you have to remember that we didn’t have all of the facts at the time that the decisions were being taken. Nobody could doubt for one moment that the prime minister was doing anything other than acting with the best of motives, with the information and the advice that was available to him ... At the very beginning of the pandemic we didn’t know much about this new virus.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>I will post more from Jenrick’s interviews shortly.</p> \n  <p>Here is the agenda for the day.<br></p> \n  <p><em>10am: </em>Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, gives a speech on transport policy.</p> \n  <p><em>10.30am: </em>Matt Hancock, the health secretary, answers a Commons urgent question about his department’s handling of Covid.</p> \n  <p><em>12pm:</em> Downing Street is expected to hold its daily lobby briefing.</p> \n  <p><em>12pm:</em> Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, takes questions in the Scottish parliament.</p> \n  <p><em>2pm: </em>Public Health England publishes its weekly Covid surveillance report.<br></p> \n  <p><em>2.30pm: </em>Sir Tom Scholar, the Treasury permanent secretary, gives evidence to the Commons Treasury committee about Greensill Capital; at 4pm Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, will give evidence.</p> \n  <p><em>2.30pm:</em> Tony Sewell, chair of the commission on race and ethnic disparities, gives evidence to the Commons women and equalities committee.</p> \n  <p><em>3.30pm:</em> Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, gives evidence to the public administration and constitutional affairs committee about Covid-status certification.</p> \n  <p><em>5pm:</em> Hancock holds a press conference.</p> \n  <p>And Boris Johnson is doing a visit this morning, where he is expected to record a short TV interview.</p> \n  <p>Politics Live has been a mix of Covid and non-Covid politics recently, but today I expect to be focusing mostly on Hancock, and other reaction to Cummings’ evidence yesterday.

Or is Cummings not telling the truth? Hancock repeats what he said before. Of course he committed to putting the policy in place, he says. But it took time. They did not start with a testing system in place. Q: It was common knowledge last year there were problems with care homes. Did you protect them? And did you or did you not tell Downing Street people would be tested before being discharged into care homes? Hancock says they committed to building the testing capacity to allow people to be tested. But that took time. And he needed to use targets to build that up. (Dominic Cummings criticised his use of the 100,000 tests per day target.) This is a matter of public record, he says. (Hancock has not specifically address Cummings’ claims that patients were being tested before they were discharged.) Hancock sidesteps question about whether he told No 10 patients would be tested before being discharged. Q: With each new variant the effectiveness of new vaccines becomes less and less. So why is lockdown relaxation continuing when most of those who spread the virus have not yet had a single vaccination? Hancock says they are working as fast as they can to get people vaccinated. And they are monitoring new variants carefully. He says the effectiveness of the vaccine after two jabs is effectively the same against the Indian variant as it is against the Kent variant. Harries says Public Health Report published a report at the weekend showing both main vaccines are effective against the Indian variant after two doses. But it is important to be vigilant, she says. And here are the recent figures for the number of people in hospital. Unlike with cases, there is no rise, Harries says. But deaths are rising, she says. Harries is now presenting the slides. This one shows rising cases. She says some of this is due to surge testing, and more people being tested. But it is also a consequence of the Indian variant she says. Hancock says Eddie Gray from GSK will chair the antivirals taskforce set up by the PM. Hancock says 500,000 people have signed up for the vaccine research registry - which means they are willing to take part in vaccine trials. He says the government is funding the expansion of another Oxford study, looking at whether vaccines can be mixed. If it shows they can, that would speed up vaccination programmes around the world. Hancock says the vaccine is severing the link between Covid cases and hospitalisations. He says the latest ONS data shows that three out of our people have anti-Covid antibodies, and for the over-50s it is over 90%. He says it is estimated that the vaccination programme has now prevented 13,200 deaths and 39,700 hospitalisations. Hancock says the latest data shows Covid cases rising. (See 4.42pm.) He says the latest estimates are that more than half of new cases are the Indian variant, and it could be up to three quarters, he says. Matt Hancock is holding his press conference. He is joined by Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency. Government air-passenger arrival figures released today show that more than 12 million people have flown into the UK since the start of the March 2020 lockdown, and 1.59 million between January and April this year, Labour says. About two thirds of arrivals in 2021 were non-UK nationals, adds Labour. Nick Thomas-Symonds, the shadow home secretary, said: Time and time again, the UK government promised strong border measures, but the truth is now out – millions of people have been flying in to the UK with only a tiny percentage going into hotel quarantine. It’s beyond reckless that so many people arrived during the third lockdown when international travel was supposed to be tightly restricted. No wonder we have had so many variant outbreaks, with Conservative chaos on border protections. The UK has updated its coronavirus dashboard, and there is a mix of good news and bad news. On the plus side, 663,577 doses of vaccine were administered yesterday. That is not a record - the biggest daily total came on 20 March, when more than 800,000 got a jab - but it is still one of the highest daily totals on record. This is from Nadhim Zahawi, the vaccine deployment minister. But on the minus side, all three key indicators on the dashboard for the virus are now heading in the wrong direction. Covid deaths are up 14% week on week. Only 10 deaths have been recorded today, and the total for the past week is just 57; compared to the numbers earlier this year, these are still very small. But until recently the week-on-week trend was down, and yesterday it was flat. Covid cases are up 20.5% week on week. Today 3,542 new cases have been recorded. Yesterday the most recent seven-day total was 18% up on the previous week. Hospital admissions are up 19.9% week on week. This is a lagging indicator, because the figures on the dashboard only cover the period up to Sunday 23 May, when 112 patients were admitted to hospital, but yesterday the week-on-week increase was 10.8%. A total of 52,689,008 Covid-19 vaccinations took place in England between 8 December and 26 May, according to NHS England data, including first and second doses, which is a rise of 574,865 on the previous day. As PA Media reports, NHS England said 32,285,684 were the first dose of a vaccine, a rise of 206,311 on the previous day, while 20,403,324 were a second dose, an increase of 368,554. In his evidence Michael Gove was asked if he had come to a view as to what the balance was between the costs and the benefits of introducing Covid-status certificates. He replied: “Finely balanced”. Michael Gove is giving evidence to the committee about Covid-status certificates - the documentation that could be used to help people access venues by giving information about people’s vaccination record, or recent test results. At one point these were referred to as Covid passports. Gove has been leading the government review exploring the idea. As HuffPost’s Paul Waugh reports, he is not sounding very positive about them. And these are from the Mirror’s Dan Bloom. Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, is giving evidence to the Commons public administration and constitutional affairs committee. At the start William Wragg (Con), the chair, asked if Gove agreed with Dominic Cummings, who told the committee hearing yesterday about how he had texted Boris Johnson to tell him the Cabinet Office was “terrifyingly shit”. Gove had a simple answer - no. At first minister’s questions in Edinburgh Nicola Sturgeon suggested that Boris Johnson’s failure to act swiftly at certain times in the pandemic had led to “loss of life”. As the Herald reports, Sturgeon said: Sometimes I’m afraid, in the interests of health and human life, it is necessary for people in leadership positions like me to take very quick decisions because, as we know from bitter experience over this pandemic, it’s often the failure to take quick and firm decisions that leads to loss of life. And anybody who’s in any doubt about that only had to listen to a fraction of what Dominic Cummings outlined about what he described as the chaotic response of the UK government at key moments of this pandemic. So I will continue to try to take difficult decisions as well as I possibly can. I’m Andrew Sparrow, taking over again from Caroline Davies. New absence figures published by the Department for Education reveal that 60% of pupils in England were kept out of school for Covid-related reasons at some time last autumn. The national data for the term that began when schools reopened in September shows that pupils missed 33 million days in the classroom because of Covid, through having to self-isolate or for shielding reasons. That sent the overall absence rate to nearly 12% for the term, compared with less than 5% in a normal term. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the figures confirmed the turbulence that schools had to deal with, and the lack of support they received from the government. Barton said: The government’s refusal to give schools any flexibility to finish in-school teaching early before Christmas, which was accompanied by threats of legal action, made matters even worse. The prime minister’s former senior adviser spoke yesterday of the government’s shortcomings in the handling of this crisis and it is certainly the case that schools and colleges were badly let down by government leadership during the autumn term. The Treasury did not know Greensill was struggling financially when lobbying efforts were launched by former prime minister David Cameron for funds during the pandemic, a senior official has told MPs. Charles Roxburgh, second permanent secretary to the Treasury, told the Treasury select committee on founder Lex Greensill: We knew about the problems he had funding his SVPs (special-purpose vehicles). We did not discuss whether his core business was in trouble ... We knew about funding problems. We had no information about any threat to the solvency of his core business. That came much later. A total of 52,689,008 Covid-19 vaccinations took place in England between December 8 and May 26, according to NHS England data, including first and second doses, which is a rise of 574,865 on the previous day. NHS England said 32,285,684 were the first dose of a vaccine, a rise of 206,311 on the previous day, while 20,403,324 were a second dose, an increase of 368,554. Hi. This is Caroline Davies taking over the blog for a short while. Union membership has increased for the fourth year in a row, up by almost 120,000 in 2020, PA Media reports. PA says: The TUC welcomed the increase, saying thousands of workers have turned to unions during the coronavirus crisis, to protect their jobs and defend their rights. The Resolution Foundation said union membership increased from 6.2 million to 6.6 million between 2016 and 2020, a “significant” rise but still half the peak membership of 13.2 million in 1979. My colleague Caroline Davies is taking over the blog now. I will be back a bit later. More than 11,000 care home residents died with Covid in England and Wales in the period in which Dominic Cummings has alleged he and Boris Johnson believed that people discharged from hospital were being tested. Cummings claimed in his testimony to MPs yesterday that Matt Hancock, the health secretary, had told colleagues - including the prime minister - that hospital patients were to be tested before being discharged to care homes. “We were told categorically in March that people would be tested before they went back to care homes. We only subsequently found out that that hadn’t happened,” Cummings said. Hancock refused to deny this specific allegation in parliament earlier. Cummings said they only discovered that people were not being tested after being discharged in mid-April. But given that deaths on average were occurring 13 days after becoming sympomatic in the first wave, it is appropriate to count all deaths occurring up to the end of May (government advice changed on 15 April to state that “all patients discharged from hospital to be tested before going into care homes as a matter of course”). While we now know that more people died with Covid in care homes in England and Wales in the second wave of the pandemic than in the first, the same dataset shows the sharp increase in deaths in those settings in April 2020. Data released by the ONS last week shows that there were 11,706 deaths in care homes between 13 March and 1 May 2020. This is significantly higher than the known death toll at the time because these figures include care home residents who later died in hospital, unlike contemporaneous figures which only counted those occurring within the care home itself. On a visit to Bristol Sir Keir Starmer said the evidence given by Dominic Cummings yesterday about the government’s handling of coronavirus meant the public inquiry should be brought forward. He said: They are very serious allegations from Dominic Cummings about the chaos and the incompetence of the decision-making in the government and there are consequences for that in relation to those that died ... I don’t think Dominic Cummings should have the last word on this and that’s why all the evidence should be put before the committee, the health secretary should answer the allegations and the inquiry should be fast-forwarded. It’s not about taking anyone’s word - it’s about getting to the bottom of it. Asked if he agreed with Cummings that Boris Johnson was unfit to be PM, Starmer replied: I don’t think the prime minister has made good decisions in this pandemic. I was very concerned about the repeated mistakes from the first wave into the second wave, and in particular the slowness to lock down in the autumn, and I think the prime minister got that completely wrong. There are consequences and this is what all these allegations are about and that’s why the inquiry needs to be fast-forwarded, and we can’t have this drip, drip, drip of allegations, and we need to get to the bottom of it. The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group, which has been campaigning for an inquiry and wants it to start now, has criticised Matt Hancock, the health secretary, for telling MPs earlier he was committed to transparency, when he has not been willing to meet the group. The number of rapid Covid-19 tests carried out in England has fallen to its lowest level in five weeks – despite all members of the public being eligible to take two rapid tests a week, PA Media reports. PA says: Just under 4.9m rapid tests were conducted in England in the week to 19 May, according to the latest test and trace figures (pdf) – down 4% on the previous week. It is the fourth week in a row that the number has decreased. Public Health England has published its latest weekly Covid surveillance report (pdf). Here is the PHE summary of what it says. Surveillance indicators suggest that at a national level Covid-19 activity increased slightly in [the week ending Sunday 23 May]. Case rates have increased or stayed level across all age groups. Case rates ... were highest in those aged 10 to 19, with a case rate of 55.2 per 100,000 population. The lowest case rates continued to be in those aged 70 to 79, with a rate of 4.1 per 100,000 population. Case rates per 100,000 were highest in the north-west, at 52.8. Case rates per 100,000 are lowest in the south-west, with a rate of 9.2. The hospital admission rate for Covid-19 is 0.79 per 100,000 ... compared to 0.75 per 100,000 in the previous week. Hospital admission rates for Covid-19 ... were highest in the West Midlands with a rate of 1.64. The highest hospital admission rates continue to be those aged 85 and above. Commenting on the figures, Dr Yvonne Doyle, the PHE medical director, said: Covid infection rates have risen across most age groups and regions, but encouragingly the number in hospitals across the country remains low. However, we are concerned about the outbreak of the variant first discovered in India and in some areas hospitalisations have slightly risen. This is a reminder that we still have a way to go and need to remain cautious. At the lobby briefing Downing Street has defended the meeting between Boris Johnson and the authoritarian Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, taking place tomorrow. As PA Media reports, asked what would be discussed at the meeting, the PM’s spokesman said: As president of the Visegard Group of central European nations later this year, co-operation with Hungary is vital to the UK’s prosperity and security. He said the meeting would “promote UK interests in these areas and discuss issues in the wider region”. As PA reports, the spokesman also condemned comments made by Orbán on Muslims and migrants. Orbán has spoken of “Muslim invaders” and described migrants as “a poison”. The spokesman said: On all human rights issues we do not shy away from raising them. The PM has condemned those specific comments which were divisive and wrong. In his evidence yesterday Dominic Cummings accused Carrie Symonds, the prime minister’s fiancee, of trying to fill No 10 jobs with her friends, in a manner that broke the rules. At the Downing Street lobby briefing the PM’s spokesman denied this. “All appointments made in No 10 are done in the normal way,” he said. “That’s always been the case.” Here is a fuller version of what Boris Johnson said in his pooled TV interview this morning. He was visiting a hospital in Colchester, and what was striking was how soft his response to Dominic Cummings was. Although there was an ultra-generalised rejection of some of what Cummings was saying - “some of the commentary I’ve heard doesn’t bear any relation to reality” - Johnson did not accuse his former aide of lying (even about a claim Johnson has previously denied 100%). And although he rejected what Cummings said about tens of thousands of people dying unnecessarily, he did so in an understated way (“I don’t think so”). This may be because No 10 does not have the evidence to refute Cummings’ claims, because they were accurate. But it may also reflect a desire to de-escalate the story, and to avoid provoking Cummings any further. Here are the main points. Johnson rejected the claim made by Dominic Cummings that tens of thousands of people died unnecessarily because of mistakes made by the government. He also repeated his longstanding claim that the government followed the scientific advice. He said: At every stage we’ve been governed by a determination to protect life, to save life, and to ensure that our NHS is not overwhelmed. And we’ve followed to the best we can the data and the guidance we’ve had. But yesterday Cummings set out in detail how Johnson ignored scientific advice in September to order a second lockdown. This has been very well documented, and is not seriously contested. Johnson sought to draw a line under the controversy about whether or not he said he would rather see “bodies pile high” than order a third lockdown. In the Commons last month Johnson denied making that comment, or remarks to that effect. But yesterday Cummings said he heard the PM say it. Asked today if he did say he would rather see “bodies pile high” than order a third lockdown, Johnson replied: I have already made my position very clear on that point. I’m getting on with the job of delivering the road map that I think is the sensible way forward. Asked if Cummings was telling the truth, Johnson sidestepped the question. Asked if that meant he was not contesting with what Cummings said, Johnson replied: “I make no comment on that.” Viewers might conclude that, if Johnson did not say that remark, or anything to the same effect, he might be denying it more forcefully. Johnson said the government did “everything we could” to protect care homes. He claimed that some of Cummings’ evidence was wrong - without giving details. Asked if Cummings was right to say Johnson was not fit to lead the country, Johnson replied: I think that it’s important for us to focus on what really matters to the people in this country and I think, if I may say so, that some of the commentary I’ve heard doesn’t bear any relation to reality and what people want us to get on with is delivering the roadmap and trying, cautiously, to take our country forward through what has been one of the most difficult periods that I think anybody can remember. He said he could not see anything currently in the data to suggest the planned lifting of remaining restrictions in England on 21 June would have to be delayed. He said the government had always expected cases to rise around now. But the government was still looking at the data to see quite what effect the vaccines were having on keeping people out of hospital, he said. He said: I want to stress that we always did expect to see an increase in cases, that was always going to happen. So what we need to understand is to what extent the vaccine programme is starting to make a real difference in interrupting the link between infection and hospitalisations and serious illness and death. Now, clearly, the vaccines are having a big impact already. The question is, how big, how reliable are the vaccine fortifications, and what we do know with the [B.1.617.2] variant is the vaccines work against it, particularly with two doses. Yesterday’s UK government dashboard figures showed case numbers up 18% week on week. In his interview Boris Johnson rejected the claim made by Dominic Cummings that tens of thousands of people died unnecessarily because of mistakes made by the government. Asked if tens of thousands of people died because of his inaction, he replied: No I don’t think so. But, of course, this has been an incredibly difficult series of decisions, none of which we’ve taken lightly. Boris Johnson has given a broadcast interview this morning. According to PA Media, he said lockdowns were a “very, very painful and traumatic thing” that had to be “set against the horror of the pandemic” and that he had followed the scientific data. I will post more from the interview shortly. Matt Hancock is off the hook - at least for now. That was the clear takeaway from his performance in the Commons just now. That is not because he has refuted (proved wrong) all or any of the allegations Dominic Cummings made about him in his select committee evidence yesterday. Most of them he did not even rebut (claim to be wrong), because as far as he could he refused to engage with the substance of what Cummings said. But Conservative MPs gave him the most solid support he could hope for, which went well beyond loyalist sycophants asking suck-up questions at the behest of the whips. Cummings was famously contemptuous of most MPs (even Brexity ones), and the feeling seems to be heartily reciprocated. Tory MPs feel much more warmly towards Hancock, and almost all of the ones who spoke showed zero interest in re-opening a debate about who in government said what when, despite the immense significance of the decisions taken. Even Jeremy Hunt, the chair of the health committee, who has generally been a shrewd critic of government policy, and who is running an inquiry specifically intended to get to the truth of what happened, spoke about the Cummings allegations about Hancock with disdain. Until there was “evidence”, they were “unproven”, he said (see 10.49am) - as if Cummings telling MPs that he was in the room when he heard these things being said wasn’t evidence. But it was telling that on the one Cummings allegation on which he was repeatedly questioned - that he told colleagues patients would be tested before being discharged into care homes, when in fact that did not happen - Hancock studiously avoided denying the claim. (See 11.07am.) Some of the other allegations made by Cummings did not even come up at all. It may be that the moment of reckoning has just been postponed. Steve Brine (Con) says it is not the case (as Dominic Cummings implied yesterday that the world is “divided into people who are either useless or brilliant”. Instead the country did its best and people came together, he says. Hancock agrees. He says people work best when they have a common mission. And that was the last question. The UQ is over. Labour’s Barbara Keeley asks if Hancock knew people were being discharged into care homes without being tested. Hancock says he has answered this many times. He says they had to build the testing capacity. Earlier the Labour MP for Bolton South East, Yasmin Qureshi suggested Boris Johnson and other ministers should be investigated for corporate manslaughter. She said: When will the prime minister and others be investigated by the police for alleged corporate manslaughter? Last week my constituents were wrongly accused of vaccine hesitancy and then we had a quasi-lockdown that no-one knew about and many people’s travel plans were thrown in chaos. My constituents can forgive the government for that, but I am sure that I speak for the country when I say that we cannot forgive tens of thousands of people who died and didn’t need to die - the chilling words of Dominic Cummings. Hancock replied: No, but what I would say to the people of Bolton is that - the people of Bolton have again risen to this challenge. The number of vaccinations happening in Bolton right now is phenomenal, tens of thousands every single day and it is heartening to see the queues of people coming forward. Peter Bone (Con) condemns the “outrageous claims by an unelected Spad [Dominic Cummings] who broke Covid regulations, admitted he leaked stuff to the BBC and by his own admissions admitted he was not fit to be in Downing Street”. Hancock says life in government “has got easier” since Cummings left. William Wragg (Con) asks Hancock if he agrees that it is odd that people who used to regard Dominic Cummings as a “latter day King Herod, whose words and deeds could not be trusted” into a prophet, whose truth was written on tablets. Hancock says the public want the government to focus on dealing with Covid. Mark Logan (Con) says his local health officials say they are fans of Hancock’s. He thanks Hancock for his engagement with MPs. And he thanks him in particular for his work for Bolton. This gives a general flavour of the tone that Tory MPs have been adopting to Hancock in this session. Some of them have been inviting him to their constituencies too. These are from the Critic’s Rob Hutton. Hancock told MPs the public inquiry would cover not just how the UK government handled the pandemic, but how the Scottish and Welsh governments, and the Northern Ireland executive, handled it too. But how that would be done was yet to be determined, he said. Neale Hanvey (Alba) asks if Hancock told colleagues that people would be tested before being discharged into care homes. Hancock says so many of yesterday’s allegations were unsubstantiated. He says the Scottish government had to respond to the same problems, as did governments in other countries. He says testing was increased. And because of that testing was then rolled out more broadly. Hancock refuses to deny Cummings claim he told colleagues patients would be tested before being discharged into care homes. UPDATE: From the Times’ Steven Swinford Mark Harper (Con) asks about the India variant. He says he thinks the vaccines are very effective at stopping serious disease, including from the Indian variant. If that is the case, does Hancock agree that full reopening should go ahead from 21 June. Hancock says this is the key question. In Covid hotspots, he says one person in 10 in hospital has had both jabs. He says this suggests that we can have a “high degree of confidence” that the vaccines are effective against serious illness. But it also shows they are not 100% effective, he says. He says we will know more about this in the coming weeks. Munira Wilson (Lib Dem) says if the government did sent people back to care homes without being tested, that was one of the biggest scandals. When was testing for discharged patients routinely offered? Hancock says this has been a challenging time. He says the government published full details of the approach it took. It worked with the care home sector on keeping people safe, and followed the clinical advice. Cherilyn Mackrory (Con) told Hancock in the Commons he should “ignore unsubstantiated Westminster gossip” and carry on with his job. Jeremy Hunt, the chair of the Commons health committee, says the allegations made by Dominic Cummings are serious, and as yet should be treated as “unproven”. At yesterday’s joint select committee hearing, serious allegations were made. We asked for evidence to be provided and until such evidence is provided those allegations should be treated as unproven. He asks if Prof Neil Fergusion was right to say the India variant is now dominant. (See 9.52am.) Hancock says the India variant is spreading across the country. Estimates vary as to what proportion of new cases it accounts for. He says it is too early to say if it will be safe to take further steps on 21 June. A formal assessment will be taken before 14 June, he says Hancock is replying to Ashworth. He says “these unsubstantiated allegations around honesty are not true”. He says he has been “straight with people” in public and in private. He says every day he has gone into work thinking about what he can do to save lives. And he says he has been accountable, making more than 60 Commons statements and holding 84 press conferences. UPDATE: Hancock said: These allegations that were put yesterday - and repeated by [Jonathan Ashworth] - are serious allegations and I welcome the opportunity to come to the house to put formally on the record that these unsubstantiated allegations around honesty are not true and I’ve been straight with people in public and in private throughout. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, is speaking now. He says the public deserve answers. Are the claims false? Why were people discharged into care homes without tests? Did Hancock tell No 10 people would be tested? Why did he not insist on a precautionary approach? Vaccines are now open to people aged 30 and above, he says. And he says it is on track to get every adult vaccinated by the end of July. Setting ambitious targets in government is how you get things done, he says. (That is is first reference to Dominic Cummings, who criticised Hancock over his 100,000 tests per day target.) And that’s it. He does not address the Cummings allegations directly. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, is welcomed by loudish Tory cheering as he stands up. He says the pandemic is not over yet. The vaccination programme has reached 73% of the adult population. But that means more than a quarter of people have not been vaccinated. He says the number of cases yesterday was at the highest level since 12 April. But he says the link between cases and hospitalisation has been broken. In the Commons Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, starts the urgent question by reminding MPs that they are not normally meant to accuse each other of lying. As well as doing interviews this morning, Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, had his first jab. He is 39. That means every member of the cabinet has had at least one dose, Nadhim Zahawi, the vaccine deployment minister, says. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, is about to answer an urgent question from Labour about his handling of coronavirus. Here is my colleague Aubrey Allegretti’s preview story. Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, suggested the government was “wilfully neglectful” in its handling of coronavirus. In an interview with Sky News this morning she said: The public inquiry should start immediately. But we also know that the government did a lessons learned review, and they failed to publish the results of that. I think the public need reassurance by making sure that that is in the public domain ... There are serious questions for today, not just about what happened in the past, but how do we protect our loved ones today. And if the government were wilfully neglectful, knowing that they were going to put people’s lives at risk, people need to know that now. It was not clear from the interview whether Rayner intended to go this far or not. There is a lot of evidence to support the claim that government errors cost lives. But to say it was done “wilfully” implies an intent to cause harm. When the presenter, Stephen Dixon, challenged Rayner as to whether that was what she really meant, she did not retract the claim, but she did not elaborate on it either. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, declined to answer questions about Dominic Cummings when he left home this morning. Speaking to reporters outside his house in north-west London, Hancock said: I’m just off to drive forward the vaccine programme and then I’ll be going to the House of Commons and I’ll answer questions there. Labour has moved the writ for the Batley and Spen byelection to take place on Thursday 1 July. Prof Neil Ferguson, the Imperial College epidemiologist whose modelling played a key role in persuading Boris Johnson to order the original lockdown last year, told the Today programme this morning that the variant originating in India (B.1.617.2) is now the dominant one in the UK. He said: It’s now in well over the majority of local authority areas in the country and is now the dominant strain. The majority of new cases are of the variant - that is obviously concerning. It’s gone from being really a small minority a month ago to the majority variant. Ferguson said this meant that whether or not England would be able to go ahead with step 4 of the roadmap - the lifting of all remaining restrictions - was “in the balance”. He explained: Step 4 is rather in the balance, the data collected in the next two to three weeks will be critical. The key issue as to whether we can go forward is: will the surge caused by the Indian variant - and we do think there will be a surge - be more than has been already planned in to the relaxation measures? So it was always expected that relaxation would lead to a surge in infections and to some extent a small third wave of transmission - that’s inevitable if you allow contact rates in population to go up, even despite immunity - [but] we can’t cope with that being too large. In the next two or three weeks we will be able to come to a firm assessment of whether it’s possible to go forward. Ferguson also restated his claim that locking down a week early in March 2020 would have saved 20,000 to 30,000 lives. He said: I think that’s unarguable. I mean, the epidemic was doubling every three to four days in weeks 13 to 23 March, and so had we moved the interventions back a week we would have curtailed that and saved many lives. Good morning. Today will be dominated by Matt Hancock, the health secretary, responding to the multiple criticisms of him made by Dominic Cummings, the prime minister’s former chief adviser, in his select committee evidence yesterday - Hancock is in the Commons this morning, and holding a press conference this afternoon - but Cummings did not just criticise Hancock, and it is for the government as a whole to respond too. Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, was doing the morning interview round and he made it clear that the government is taking a dual-pronged approach. Broadly, it is not going to engage with Cummings, Jenrick implied, because he said the government wanted to wait until the inquiry, which is not due to start until next year. Jenrick said: The last year has been uniquely challenging and difficult for everyone in ways, but very, very profoundly difficult for those people who’ve lost loved ones and they are right to seek answers and explanations. That’s why we’re having the full public inquiry next year. I think that is the right moment to consider these things in a calm and reflective manner with all of the evidence. But ministers are responding to some of Cummings’ allegations and Jenrick said he did not believe probably the most damning one of all - that “tens of thousands of people died who didn’t need to die”. Asked if Cummings was wrong to make this claim, Jenrick replied: Yes, I think it is because you have to remember that we didn’t have all of the facts at the time that the decisions were being taken. Nobody could doubt for one moment that the prime minister was doing anything other than acting with the best of motives, with the information and the advice that was available to him ... At the very beginning of the pandemic we didn’t know much about this new virus. I will post more from Jenrick’s interviews shortly. Here is the agenda for the day. 10am: Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, gives a speech on transport policy. 10.30am: Matt Hancock, the health secretary, answers a Commons urgent question about his department’s handling of Covid. 12pm: Downing Street is expected to hold its daily lobby briefing. 12pm: Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, takes questions in the Scottish parliament. 2pm: Public Health England publishes its weekly Covid surveillance report. 2.30pm: Sir Tom Scholar, the Treasury permanent secretary, gives evidence to the Commons Treasury committee about Greensill Capital; at 4pm Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, will give evidence. 2.30pm: Tony Sewell, chair of the commission on race and ethnic disparities, gives evidence to the Commons women and equalities committee. 3.30pm: Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, gives evidence to the public administration and constitutional affairs committee about Covid-status certification. 5pm: Hancock holds a press conference. And Boris Johnson is doing a visit this morning, where he is expected to record a short TV interview. Politics Live has been a mix of Covid and non-Covid politics recently, but today I expect to be focusing mostly on Hancock, and other reaction to Cummings’ evidence yesterday. For global Covid developments, do read our global live blog. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can’t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.

Sanctions have “massive humanitarian costs” on often very poor nations, yet they “are not only ineffective but likely counterproductive”. They make sense only in terms of “domestic politics and political psychology”. </p> <p>The reality is that besieged economies often benefit from a degree of protection from outside forces. Sanctions customarily weaken a regime’s enemies, silence critical media, close doors and suppress emergent opposition. No one seriously thinks China today is weakening in its policy towards the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/20/eu-parliament-freezes-china-trade-deal-over-sanctions\">Uyghurs</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/28/hong-kong-passes-law-that-can-stop-people-leaving\">Hong Kong</a> by western sanctions. All they do is enable western politicians to look good. The ultimate post-imperial fantasy, still rife in Britain and the US, is that the rest of the world quakes before its moral pronouncements.</p> <p>Sanctions confirm that no area of public policy is as devoid of reason as foreign affairs, or as swamped by emotion. Champions of sanctions, as against Belarus today, can only plead, but what would you do? They cannot handle the answer; do nothing if you are simply going make it worse. Don’t prop up dictatorship. Don’t hurt ordinary people. Don’t be stupid. Doing “something” is not compulsory. The only real way the outside world will get rid of Lukashenko is to go to war with him – and Russia – and even Boris Johnson is not that stupid.</p> <p>The saddest casualty of sanctions machismo is so-called soft power, because soft power lacks the headline-grabbing language of hitting, punishing, hurting, crippling. I would bet a million pounds spent on boosting the BBC World Service into eastern Europe and other media support for dissidents would do more than a billion dollars in cancelled trade. The same goes for educating the offspring of these regimes – for example, the schooling of the children of China’s ruling class in the UK and US. It goes for welcoming their businesses, conferring with their academics, playing them at sport and admiring their monuments. Such effects are long-term. But all contact sustains the conversation of freedom. The silence of sanctions just feeds the vanity of regimes – as it does of our own.</p> <ul> <li><p>Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul>","wordcount":"875","commentCloseDate":"2021-05-30T16:19:04Z","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2021-05-27T16:19:04Z","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2021-05-27T16:23:02Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/p/htvay","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/3cd9be963ee6df76a39581a663830d4799446f46/0_31_6488_3895/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","isLive":"true","bodyText":"What should we do about Belarus?

The American defence analyst Robert Pape long ago studied their efficacy as a tool of foreign policy, achieving change “in only five of 115 attempts since 1914”. Another sanctions expert, Columbia University’s Richard Hanania, is more scathing. Sanctions have “massive humanitarian costs” on often very poor nations, yet they “are not only ineffective but likely counterproductive”. They make sense only in terms of “domestic politics and political psychology”. The reality is that besieged economies often benefit from a degree of protection from outside forces. Sanctions customarily weaken a regime’s enemies, silence critical media, close doors and suppress emergent opposition. No one seriously thinks China today is weakening in its policy towards the Uyghurs or Hong Kong by western sanctions. All they do is enable western politicians to look good. The ultimate post-imperial fantasy, still rife in Britain and the US, is that the rest of the world quakes before its moral pronouncements. Sanctions confirm that no area of public policy is as devoid of reason as foreign affairs, or as swamped by emotion. Champions of sanctions, as against Belarus today, can only plead, but what would you do? They cannot handle the answer; do nothing if you are simply going make it worse. Don’t prop up dictatorship. Don’t hurt ordinary people. Don’t be stupid. Doing “something” is not compulsory. The only real way the outside world will get rid of Lukashenko is to go to war with him – and Russia – and even Boris Johnson is not that stupid. The saddest casualty of sanctions machismo is so-called soft power, because soft power lacks the headline-grabbing language of hitting, punishing, hurting, crippling. I would bet a million pounds spent on boosting the BBC World Service into eastern Europe and other media support for dissidents would do more than a billion dollars in cancelled trade. The same goes for educating the offspring of these regimes – for example, the schooling of the children of China’s ruling class in the UK and US. It goes for welcoming their businesses, conferring with their academics, playing them at sport and admiring their monuments. Such effects are long-term. But all contact sustains the conversation of freedom. The silence of sanctions just feeds the vanity of regimes – as it does of our own.

Most obviously, a new U.S. administration that is not so openly anti-China has led some former skeptics to reconsider the existing evidence.

She said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>As a scientist, spending a lot of my last year, along with many other colleagues, thinking about science, writing about science, providing scientific advice on top of our day jobs, it is quite depressing to think that all that work, and all the many reports that we’ve produced weren’t landing, and possibly weren’t being considered.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>She went on to say:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think one of the frustrations about having given scientific advice over this last year is that there isn’t feedback … whether it was rejected because it wasn’t thought to be good, or maybe there are other political priorities.

And I think that’s a shame because I think it’s quite demoralising for scientists. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>She also made a value for money argument about scientific advice being sidelined, saying: “I think it’s important for the public to know how taxpayers money is being spent, because obviously there’s a substantial expense to serving a big scientific infrastructure.”</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SkyNews/status/1397808890671243265\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\"He did paint a very depressing picture.\"<br><br>Reflecting on Dominic Cummings' claims about the actions of the govt during the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#COVID19</a> pandemic, Prof Susan Michie says scientists were not given feedback on why some of their advice was not acted on.<br><br>More: <a href=\"https://t.co/3SSMYnaDka\">https://t.co/3SSMYnaDka</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/xdZMtrLYc7\">pic.twitter.com/xdZMtrLYc7</a></p>— Sky News (@SkyNews) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SkyNews/status/1397808890671243265?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 27, 2021</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-60af42eb8f088d8c3178a829\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-05-27T07:00:54.128Z\">8.00am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Prof Ferguson: '20,000 to 30,000 lives' could have been saved</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Professor <strong>Neil Ferguson</strong>, from Imperial College London, whose modelling was instrumental in persuading the UK government to bring in the first lockdown, said scientists had become increasingly concerned in the week leading up to 13 March 2020 about the lack of a clear plan, and 20,000 to 30,000 lives could have been saved with earlier action.<br></p> \n  <p>Asked on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme when the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), of which he was part, determined that a policy of pursuing herd immunity would lead to a vast number of deaths, he said a key meeting was held with the NHS on 1 March “which finalised estimates around health impacts, so the week after that really.”</p> \n  <p>PA report Ferguson said he “wasn’t privy to what officials were thinking within government”, but added: “I would say from the scientific side there was increasing concern that week leading up to the 13 of March about the lack of clear, let’s say, (a) resolved plan of what would happen in the next few days in terms of implementing social distancing.”<br></p> \n  <p>He said: “I think one of the biggest lessons to learn in such circumstances is we really need good surveillance within the country at a much earlier point than we actually had it back in March last year.

I’ll be with you for the next few hours. We’ve just published this from <strong>Dr Deepti Gurdasani</strong>, who is a clinical epidemiologist and senior lecturer in machine learning at Queen Mary University of London:</em></p> \n  <p>Amid the select committee revelations from <strong>Dominic Cummings</strong>, and in his recent claims on social media, there has been a lot of focus on suggestions that the UK government was following a “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/23/priti-patel-denies-cummings-claim-herd-immunity-was-ever-uk-policy\">herd immunity</a>” policy at the start of the pandemic, costing thousands of lives in the process. Of course, none of this is surprising.</p> \n  <p>It is very clear that this was the flawed policy of the government through early March last year, not least because it was publicly discussed by the <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/health/boris-johnson-coronavirus-this-morning/\">prime minister</a> and by many <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Kilsally/status/1238780879050326016?s=20\">scientific advisers</a> to the government – including <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XRc389TvG8\">Patrick Vallance</a>, who spoke of “enough people becoming immune to this” with mild illness, to help build herd immunity.</p> \n  <p>The alternative strategy of high suppression or elimination of the virus was rejected by the government very early on, despite strong evidence from other countries around the world showing that this could be successfully applied.</p> \n  <p>There were several elements that underpinned the devastating herd immunity strategy. It was believed that infection of large swathes of the population was inevitable, and acceptable, and that there was no way to prevent it. This came with the tacit acknowledgment that hundreds of thousands of deaths were acceptable, most of which would occur among vulnerable and elderly people. A sense of national exceptionalism held by some suggested that other countries’ experiences didn’t apply to us – despite that by March we had had months to observe and learn from countries in south Asia, and seeing the devastating impact of late action in Italy.</p> \n  <p>Real-world evidence was ignored in favour of models and flawed thinking. The government’s strategy repeatedly conflated Covid-19 with flu, ignoring the much higher transmissibility, higher susceptibility, which would lead to many more people getting infected and dying, and unknown long-term impacts from a novel virus. Finally, there was the idea that the health of the economy needed to be balanced with public health. A lot of emphasis was placed on the disruption lockdowns would cause, with attempts to slow down such decisions, without understanding that delays would inevitably lead to even longer lockdowns and more economic damage.</p> \n  <p><strong>Read more here: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/may/27/government-covid-strategy-herd-immunity-westminster\">Deepti Gurdasani – The UK government’s Covid strategy was discredited but we’re still paying the price</a></strong></p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/may/27/government-covid-strategy-herd-immunity-westminster\">The government's Covid strategy was discredited but we're still paying the price | Deepti Gurdasani</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-05-27T06:14:03.432Z\">at 7.14am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-60af35588f088d8c3178a79d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-05-27T06:00:22.782Z\">7.00am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Facebook to allow posts saying Covid ‘man-made’</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>This is <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2020/04/covid-19-misinfo-update/#removing-more-false-claims\">Facebook’s statement</a> on its change of policy: </p> \n  <p>In light of ongoing investigations into the origin of Covid-19 and in consultation with public health experts, we will no longer remove the claim that COVID-19 is man-made or manufactured from our apps.

As noted in an earlier post, Biden ordered the US intelligence community to “redouble” its efforts studying the origins of coronavirus, adding that it will continue to press for China to participate in a full investigation. The deputy White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre confirmed the investigation would include any possibility the trail might lead to a Chinese lab. “China wasn’t transparent enough,” she said. We have been saying that for a very long time, that China needed to provide more access to the lab, cooperate more fully with the scientific investigators. This has been shared by Andrew Cuomo, the Democratic governor of New York: Italy reported 171 Covid linked deaths on Thursday against 121 the day before, the health ministry said, while the daily tally of new infections rose to 4,147 from 3,937. Italy has registered 125,793 deaths linked to coronavirus since February last year, the second-highest toll in Europe. Patients in hospital with Covid-19 - not including those in intensive care - stood at 7,707 on Thursday, decreasing from 8,118 a day earlier, Reuters reports. Facebook has lifted a ban on posts claiming Covid-19 was man-made, following a resurgence of interest in the “lab leak” theory of the disease’s onset (see earlier post). The social network says its new policy comes “in light of ongoing investigations into the origin”. On Wednesday, the company said: In light of ongoing investigations into the origin of Covid-19 and in consultation with public health experts, we will no longer remove the claim that Covid-19 is man-made from our apps. We’re continuing to work with health experts to keep pace with the evolving nature of the pandemic and regularly update our policies as new facts and trends emerge. You can read the full story by Alex Hern, the Guardian’s UK technology editor, here: That’s it from me, Rhi Storer, for now. I will now hand the liveblog over back to Yohannes Lowe for the rest of the afternoon. Sweden will press ahead with its plan to ease some of its Covid-19 restrictions from June 1, as the number of new infections has fallen sharply in recent weeks, Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said on Thursday. “We are beginning to glimpse the beginning of the end,” Lofven told a news conference. The previously announced easing includes longer opening hours for restaurants and cafes, as well as raising the number of spectators at sports events and visitors at museums and amusement parks. Sweden registered 1,366 new Covid cases on Thursday, health agency statistics showed, the lowest number of new daily cases for more than seven month. See post here for more details. Reuters reports that Russia has signed an agreement to supply UNICEF, the United Nations’ children’s fund, with enough doses of its Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine to vaccinate 110 million people, the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which markets the shot internationally, said on Thursday. Procurement and delivery of the vaccine is subject to Sputnik V receiving an emergency use listing from the World Health Organisation, a decision which the RDIF said is expected soon. Did coronavirus come from a Wuhan lab? Despite President Biden ordering US intelligence agencies to conduct a 90-day review of what is known about the origins of Covid-19, and various stories in the US media claiming support is growing for the Wuhan lab leak theory, the answer is that surprisingly little has changed in terms of good quality evidence – at least in the public domain. The most striking new claim in recent days, ahead of Biden’s announcement, was in the Wall Street Journal, which reported that US intelligence agencies were told that three unnamed staff at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) were sick enough to go hospital in November 2019 with symptoms that might have been coronavirus. My colleague Peter Beaumont has all the analysis and key questions answered in his piece below: Here’s a new story about vaccines via Associated Press. Two vaccines made by China’s pharmaceutical firm Sinopharm appear safe and effective against coronavirus, according to a study published in a medical journal. The report, published online in the Journal of the American Medical Association, concluded the two vaccines are about 73% and 78% effective, as Sinopharm has previously claimed. Researchers from Sinopharm and local partners based in the Middle East say the trial involved 40,380 participants with the company’s two vaccines. One vaccine was developed by the Wuhan Institute of Biological Products and the other by the Beijing Institute of Biological Products — and an additional placebo. The trial, mainly performed on young men, was carried out in four countries — Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Egypt and Jordan. However, the study only provided data from Bahrain and the UAE. “There’s nothing very surprising. It’s consistent with what they have claimed previously, but it does not completely eliminate the doubts about Sinopharm,” said Jin Dong-yan, a medical professor at the University of Hong Kong who was not involved with the study. Some experts also expressed concern at the shortage of female participants, with nearly 85% being male. “It’s important to make sure you have tested it in enough women to be able to start seeing any possible safety concerns,” said Ashley St. John, an associate professor at Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore.

Saudi Arabia will allow entertainment activities to resume for those who are vaccinated against Covid-19, state TV has reported, according to Reuters. Entertainment venues will be allowed to open at 40% capacity, it has been reported. British participation in at the Cannes film festival is under threat after new quarantine regulations put into place by the French government as the country seeks to successfully exit lockdown. After delays caused by Covid, the festival confirmed it would take place in early July, but France has announced a seven-day isolation period for visitors from the UK in response to rising concerns over the Covid variant B.1.617.2, first detected in India. The move is likely to affect thousands, both among the press corps and industry delegates, and large numbers of unregistered attendees. A government spokesperson said: There is a new situation with the progression of the so-called Indian variant in the United Kingdom. [France] will set up compulsory isolation for people coming from the United Kingdom.” The spokesperson added that more details would be made available “in the next few hours”. You can read the full story by Andrew Pulver, the Guardian’s film editor, here Reuters reports: India is considering Pfizer’s request to grant it indemnity from costs relating to severe vaccine side-effects, a government advisor said on Thursday, adding that the company had signalled availability of its Covid-19 shot, possibly from July. “We are engaged with Pfizer because they have indicated availability of... certain volume of vaccines, in the coming months, possibly starting in July,” V K Paul told a news conference. Sweden registered 1,366 new Covid cases on Thursday, health agency statistics showed, the lowest number of new daily cases for more than seven months. The country of 10m registered 15 new deaths, taking the total to 14,451, Reuters reports. Germany plans to make enough Covid vaccine doses available to offer a first shot to all children aged 12 and over by the end of August, a draft health ministry document showed. With more than 40% of the population of around 83m having received at least one dose, attention has turned to the question of extending vaccinations to adolescents. Chancellor Angela Merkel will later on Thursday discuss the question with the premiers of Germany’s 16 federal states, Reuters reports. Opinion is divided and Germany’s main expert panel on vaccinations has expressed caution. Some scientists say that, due to a lack of data on long-term effects, it might be better to vaccinate only adolescents with risk factors. A document made available before the talks made clear the government wants to push ahead and aims to have offered all 12-18 year olds at least a first shot by the end of August. Ireland’s deputy prime minister has said it is too soon to withdraw Covid related benefits that are still supporting more than 300,000 people who lost their jobs due to the pandemic, Reuters reports. Next week, ministers are due to decide whether to extend fiscal support beyond the end of June. Leo Varadkar has said the government would aim to allow firms and people time to reopen and recover in the third quarter with those payments. Russia’s Supreme Court has rejected a lawsuit from US company Gilead Sciences challenging the Russian government’s decision last year to let a Russian pharmaceutical firm develop the Covid drug remdesivir without Gilead’s consent. Pharmasyntez on Tuesday shipped a generic version of the drug - called Remdeform - to India as part of humanitarian aid contributions, Reuters reports. Reuters reports: Israel will release next week its findings on heart inflammation cases in Covid-19 vaccine recipients and then decide whether to approve inoculations of youngsters aged 12-15, a senior health official said on Thursday. Israel’s health ministry said in April it was examining a small number of such cases among people who received Pfizer/BioNtech’s PFE.N Covid-19 vaccine. The US Centers for Disease Control made a similar statement earlier this month. “We will release our final report which will say whether there really is a link to the vaccine and what the implications are,” said Sharon Alroy-Preis, the ministry’s head of public health. Once the report is made public next week, she told Army Radio: “we will issue the most responsible recommendation we can to Israelis, and of course, ultimately, it will be up to parents” to decide whether to vaccinate their children. Taiwan’s government has said that the first batch of 150,000 doses of Moderna Inc’s Covid vaccine would arrive on the island on Friday, Reuters reports. As noted earlier, Taiwan has reported 401 new local cases confirmed today, 13 deaths, and an additional 266 backlogged results from the previous week. It is an indicator that the island’s worst outbreak of the pandemic is still spreading consistently despite restrictions on social movement. Update on earlier post: Portuguese authorities have relaxed Covid safety rules for thousands of English fans coming to Porto for Saturday’s Champions League final, no longer requiring them to stay in bubbles and lifting restrictions on movement, Reuters reports. Porto police superintendent Cardoso da Silva told a news briefing: The borders are open. The city and the country are opening up little by little. Within what is possible, freedom (of movement) will not be conditioned. There are no restrictions of movement for fans. The Morrison government has come under attack over “failed” quarantine arrangements and the sluggish pace of the national vaccine rollout as Victoria enters a seven-day “circuit breaker” lockdown. There is mounting concern the latest virus wave could have become “uncontrollable” with almost 30 cases in the Melbourne-based cluster. The acting Victorian premier, James Merlino, on Thursday pointed to vaccine delays and “aged care facilities where not one person has been vaccinated” as practical problems in managing the response. Both are the responsibility of the federal government. You can read the full story by my colleagues Katharine Murphy and Sarah Martin here: Russia has administered at least one dose of a Covid vaccine to almost 17m people, the RIA news agency has cited health minister Mikhail Murashko as saying. The figure suggests Russia has given the first dose of one of its vaccines to about 3m people in the past two weeks. Deputy Prime Minister Tatiana Golikova said on 12 May that 14m Russians had received one vaccine dose, according to Reuters. Some of Russia’s regions have complained that the vaccination process is not going fast enough despite the country having begun rolling out its Sputnik V shot in December. This has been shared by ABC 7.30. In Australia, the Northern Territory government has said domestic arrivals from Melbourne’s highest risk exposure sites must self-isolate and get tested, rather than enter supervised quarantine at Howard Springs, a government run quarantine facility. Hello everyone, this is Yohannes Lowe. I’ll be running the blog until the evening (UK time). As always, feel free to get in touch on Twitter if you have any story tips. Joe Biden has ordered the US intelligence community to ‘redouble’ its efforts studying the origins of coronavirus, adding that it will continue to press for China to participate in a full investigation. China has pushed back, saying that the US “does not care about facts and truth, nor is it interested in serious scientific origin tracing.” Facebook is changing its policy to allow posts saying Covid is “man-made”. A statement from the US tech giant said “In light of ongoing investigations into the origin of Covid-19 and in consultation with public health experts, we will no longer remove the claim that Covid-19 is man-made or manufactured from our apps.” Japan pledged on Thursday to keep in close contact with Olympics stakeholders at home and abroad to ensure a safe and secure Games even as it prepared to extend a state of emergency across much of the nation, including host city Tokyo. The head of a Japanese doctors union warned holding the Olympic Games in Tokyo this summer, with tens of thousands of people gathering from around the world, could lead to the development of a new “Olympic” strain of the coronavirus. India is changing its approach to vaccines – announcing that it has scrapped local trials for “well-established” foreign coronavirus vaccines to fast-track imports. The government said it was in talks with Pfizer for “earliest possible” imports of its shots and that it had also had discussions with Johnson &amp; Johnson and Moderna. Taiwan has reported 401 new local cases confirmed today, 13 deaths, and an additional 266 backlogged results from the previous week, in a sign that the island’s worst outbreak of the pandemic is still spreading consistently despite restrictions on social movement. Taiwan’s president has accused China of interfering in its vaccine acquisition. President Tsai Ing-wen said Taiwan had made successful deals for AstraZeneca and Moderna, and were engaging with BioNTech for the Pfizer vaccine. “We had almost completed the contract signing with the German manufacturer at one point, but it has been delayed till now because China has interfered. Ireland’s health minister has said it was unclear whether enough supplies of Covid-19 vaccines would arrive in the country by the end of June to meet the government’s target of administering at least one dose to 82% of all adults. The European Commission demanded an urgent court order requiring AstraZeneca to deliver millions more vaccines to the bloc or face a hefty fine, in a case that may reflect its anger more than its need for doses. From 8am this morning, all adults in Northern Ireland have been able to book a vaccination. Switzerland is to re-open indoor restaurants and people will no longer be required to work from home, the government announced, saying it was lifting restrictions faster than previously planned. Two Covid-19 vaccines from China’s Sinopharm showed more than 70% efficacy against symptomatic cases, but it remains unclear how much protection they provide against severe or asymptomatic cases, according to the first detailed result of a large late-stage study published to the public. French pharmaceutical giant Sanofi and Britain’s GSK have announced the start of final tests of their belated Covid vaccine as they race to add their jab to the world’s arsenal against the pandemic. A major Australian retail group has been hit with $630,000 in fines for multiple breaches of consumer law related to pandemic-related health products, including hand sanitiser with alcohol levels far lower than advertised. British politics is almost entirely dominated today by responses to yesterday’s assertions by former government adviser Dominic Cummings about how the UK government handled the pandemic. Andrew Sparrow has the latest on our UK live blog… Yohannes Lowe will be with you shortly to take you through the rest of the day. In a not entirely unexpected move, China has this morning pushed back against new moves to investigate the origins of the novel coronavirus in Wuhan. It accused the Biden administration in the US of playing politics and shirking its responsibility in calling for a renewed investigation. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at a daily briefing that President Joe Biden’s order showed the US “does not care about facts and truth, nor is it interested in serious scientific origin tracing.” Biden told US intelligence officials to redouble their efforts to investigate the origins of the pandemic, including any possibility the trail might lead to a Chinese laboratory. After months of minimizing that possibility as a fringe theory, the Biden administration is joining worldwide pressure on China to be more open about the outbreak, in part aiming to head off domestic US complaints from Republican that the president has not been tough enough to press China on alleged obstruction. Regular watcher of US-China relations will know that in the daily press briefings Zhao usually has something to say about the US, and today has said the country must open itself up to investigations into its biological laboratories, including at the military’s Fort Detrick base. “The US side claims that it wants China to participate in a comprehensive, transparent, evidence-based international investigation,” Zhao said. “We would like to ask the US side to do the same as China and immediately cooperate with the World Health Organization on origin tracing research in a scientific manner.” Ireland’s health minister has said it was unclear whether enough supplies of Covid-19 vaccines would arrive in the country by the end of June to meet the government’s target of administering at least one dose to 82% of all adults. Half of Ireland’s 3.8 million adult population will have received at least one dose by the end of this week, Stephen Donnelly told parliament. But he cautioned that there was continued uncertainty around the arrival of AstraZeneca and in particular Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines. Reuters report that Ireland had been due to receive 600,000 shots of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s one-dose Janssen vaccine in the April-June period but only 26,400 shots had been delivered as of 9 May, with the vast majority set to be delivered next month. “For June we were contracted to receive about 470,000 doses of Janssen. The best case I have as of this morning is that we would receive about half of that and the worst case could be as low as around 60,000 in June,” Donnelly said. “With regards to AstraZeneca, we don’t know yet but as we know unfortunately, the supplies from AstraZeneca have consistently been under. The company has not been able to give detail as to how much it will be under for June.” Catarina Demony and Silvio Castellanos report from Porto that as thousands of English football fans flock to Portugal’s city of Porto for Saturday’s Champions League final, hotels and bars are hoping the tourism boost will be a prelude to their emergence from a collapse brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic. “It is definitely a boost for most hotels,” hotel general manager Francisco Brito told Reuters as a couple checked in behind him. “No one ever thought we could experience such a brutal hit ... it is a huge satisfaction to be back in business.” Portugal’s once-booming tourism sector suffered its worst results since the mid-1980s last year as Covid-19 grounded flights and kept visitors away. Tourism businesses across Porto have been mostly empty, leaving workers in a tight spot. Many were pushed into unemployment. Those who managed to stay afloat breathed a sigh of relief when this month UEFA moved the final from Istanbul to Porto’s Dragao Stadium after Turkey was added to the British government’s coronavirus travel-ban “red list”. Some of the city’s hotels were able to finally reopen as demand grew exponentially due to the match, Brito said. Although most of the 16,500 fans who will be allowed into the stadium will have to complete the trip within 24 hours of the final and remain in a bubble during their stay, many others have been travelling to Porto to support their teams from the sidelines. Olivier Ramadas, co-owner of sports bar Adega, said calls and emails from fans wanting to book a table for match day started pouring on the day of UEFA’s announcement. “When we received the news we felt a huge joy,” he said as English fans who arrived a few days early drank pints of beer and chatted. “It will revive the city.” Two Covid-19 vaccines from China’s Sinopharm showed more than 70% efficacy against symptomatic cases, but it remains unclear how much protection they provide against severe or asymptomatic cases, according to the first detailed result of a large late-stage study published to the public. A vaccine developed by a Wuhan-based subsidiary of Sinopharm was 72.8% effective against symptomatic COVID-19 at least two weeks after second injection, based on interim results, the peer-reviewed study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association showed on Wednesday. Reuters note that this is slightly better than the 72.5% rate announced in a company statement in February. Another vaccine developed by a Beijing-based institute linked to Sinopharm, which this month obtained emergency use approval by the World Health Organization, showed a 78.1% efficacy, the paper said. India is changing its approach to vaccines – announcing that it has scrapped local trials for “well-established” foreign coronavirus vaccines to fast-track imports. The country has been inoculating its people with the AstraZeneca vaccine produced locally at the Serum Institute, Covaxin made by local firm Bharat Biotech, and has begun rolling out Russia’s Sputnik V. But supplies are far short of the millions of doses the world’s second-most populous country needs. The government said it was in talks with Pfizer for “earliest possible” imports of its shots and that it had also had discussions with Johnson &amp; Johnson and Moderna. Last month, India pledged to fast-track approvals for foreign vaccines but its insistence on local trials was a key reason for stalled discussions with Pfizer. “The provision has now been further amended to waive the trial requirement altogether for the well-established vaccines manufactured in other countries,” the government said in a statement. None of drugmakers has sent in applications for approval with India’s drugs regulator, it said. Reuters have reported that desperate Indian states have been launching global tenders or seeking expressions of interest from firms including Pfizer and Moderna, but vaccine makers said they would only talk with the federal government. The government said supplies were tight. “The fact that global tenders have not given any results only reaffirms what we have been telling the states from day one: that vaccines are in short supply in the world and it is not easy to procure them at short notice,” it said. Andrew Sparrow is up and running for the day with our UK Covid live blog, so the latest fall-out from the Dominic Cummings revelations will be with him over there, and I’ll be continuing with global coronavirus news here. Indonesia has resumed usage of a temporarily suspended batch of AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine, the country’s food and drug agency (BPOM) said this morning. Reuters report that the agency suspended use of one batch of the vaccine to conduct an investigation after a young man died after being inoculated earlier this month. “According to test results, it can be concluded that there was no relation between the quality of Covid-19 vaccine batch number CTMAV547 with the post immunization event reported,” said BPOM. The hotline for booking a Covid-19 vaccine in Australia was unavailable for hours following the Victorian government’s decision to open up vaccinations to those aged over 40. As the acting premier, James Merlino, announced Victoria would go into a seven-day lockdown to get on top of a growing number of cases of Covid-19, he announced people aged between 40 and 49 would be able to get the Pfizer vaccine at state-run clinics from Friday. Merlino said it would be a matter for the federal government on whether the vaccine would be available for those in that age group at GP surgeries, but said the decision was arrived at due to frustration over the slow pace of the vaccine rollout. “If we had the vaccine, the commonwealth’s vaccine program effectively rolled out, we may well not be here today talking about these circuit-breaker restrictions that we must impose to keep our community safe.” Read more here: Victoria’s hotline for booking Covid vaccines crashes after being inundated with calls Joe Biden has ordered the US intelligence community to ‘redouble’ its efforts studying the origins of coronavirus, adding that it will continue to press for China to participate in a full investigation. The deputy White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre confirmed the investigation would include any possibility the trail might lead to a Chinese lab. “China wasn’t transparent enough,” she said. “We have been saying that for a very long time, that China needed to provide more access to the lab, cooperate more fully with the scientific investigators.” Adam Taylor at the Washington Post has this to say about the re-emergence of theories about a Wuhan lab leak being the source of the novel coronavirus. He writes: Well over a year since a novel coronavirus began to spread in Wuhan, the idea that the deadly outbreak could be linked to a virus research center in the Chinese city has lingered, unproven but not eliminated. Although the resurgent chatter may suggest new clues or proof, the inverse is in fact true. It is the persistent absence of any convincing evidence either for or against the theory that has prompted calls for more investigation. At least publicly, the evidence in favor of a link between the outbreak and the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) has not changed significantly in months, and many virologists still have persistent doubts that such a link exists. What has clearly changed, however, is the political debate. Most obviously, a new U.S. administration that is not so openly anti-China has led some former skeptics to reconsider the existing evidence. And public health experts — most of whom never ruled out the lab theory outright — have expressed disappointment with a World Health Organization-backed investigation that dismissed a link between WIV and the outbreak. Read more here: Washington Post – The Wuhan lab-leak theory is getting more attention. That’s because key evidence is still missing A major Australian retail group has been hit with $630,000 in fines for multiple breaches of consumer law related to pandemic-related health products, including hand sanitiser with alcohol levels far lower than advertised, the consumer watchdog has announced. Mosaic Brands Limited, an ASX-listed retail conglomerate that counts Katies, Rivers, Noni B and Rockmans among its stable of brands, has admitted to making false or misleading claims pertaining to hand sanitiser and face mask products between March and June 2020. The deputy chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, Delia Rickard, said they were particularly concerned about the misleading claims because they were made during a global pandemic. The fines come following tests by Choice, which found that the group was selling hand sanitiser with alcohol levels far lower than advertised. Choice issued a complaint to the ACCC, which conducted independent tests and found “one of the sanitisers tested contained an alcohol content of 17% and another had an alcohol content of 58%, below the percentage advertised on Mosaic Brands’ websites in each case. This was also below the minimum 60% alcohol concentration recommended by Australian health authorities,” Rickard said. Read more here: Australian retailer Mosaic Brands fined $630,000 for misleading hand sanitiser claims UK housing minister Robert Jenrick must be thrilled he got the job of facing the media this morning. He’s just had Susanna Reid open his section with the simple question: “Where is the prime minister this morning?” Zachary Wolf at CNN had this an analysis overnight on how the US government now sees the search for the origins of the global pandemic as an intelligence-led operation. He writes: Intel operation, not scientific inquiry. Biden wants the intelligence community to cooperate with other elements of the government, but getting to the bottom of how this disease occurred, at least in the eyes of the president dealing with obstruction from China, is now fully an intelligence operation. But that order likely poses a complicated challenge for intelligence agencies, which, as CNN has repeatedly reported, are limited in their ability to confidently answer the question of what actually happened. While the intelligence community has been actively engaged on the issue since it broke, Biden’s order is a public call for more, despite the fact that it has been unable to make significant progress for more than a year. So it’s the CIA, not the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that the government is now looking to. And it’s the scientists, who were adamant a year ago that the lab theory was extremely unlikely, now saying it needs more exploration. That appears to be what caused this change. But while intelligence professionals have been more cautious in characterizing their own findings, the lack of apparent progress over the last year should temper expectations, especially considering that China is uninterested or unwilling to help any effort aimed at discovering the truth. Read more here: CNN – The origin of Covid is now an intelligence operation Taiwan has reported 401 new local cases confirmed today, 13 deaths, and an additional 266 backlogged results from the previous week, in a sign that the island’s worst outbreak of the pandemic is still spreading consistently despite restrictions on social movement. Among the 13 deaths - the highest daily toll for Taiwan so far - was a woman in her 40s. Health and welfare minister Chen Chih-Shung said most of the fatalities were elderly people. More than half of the new cases were in people under the age of 40, including 45 children aged up to nine. The new cases remain concentrated in the northern cities of New Taipei and Taipei. Issues with Taiwan’s test recording system has resulted in a backlog of thousands of results, with clearance work producing hundreds of cases to revised totals each day, making it difficult to determine clear trends. The number of backlogged cases is reportedly still growing as more tests come in, despite clearance efforts. Taiwan remains under a level 3 alert, which is not a full lockdown but instead restricts personal gatherings to five indoors and 10 outdoors, encourages but does not require working from home, and which has ordered entertainment and recreation venues to close. Yesterday restaurants were ordered to transition to takeaway services only. Alarmed by their first significant outbreak since the pandemic began, Taiwan’s population has largely complied with both mandatory and requested restrictions, staying home and avoiding travel. Almost 1500 people are in centralised quarantine facilities, established for people with asymptomatic or mild cases of Covid-19 to reduce pressure on hospitals - several of which have recorded their own clusters of infections. Chen has said Taiwan will only move to level 4 alert - a lockdown - if there are 14 consecutive days of more than 100 cases (a milestone likely to be reached tomorrow), with 50% untraced (which has not been reached - just 145 of the total caseload remain unsourced). “I’m just off to drive forward the vaccine programme and then I’ll be going to the House of Commons and I’ll answer questions there.” That’s UK health minister Matt Hancock leaving his house this morning, being asked if the country can still have confidence in him. It was a suit today, not his running gear like yesterday. As you might expect, UK health secretary Matt Hancock is to respond today to those accusations by Dominic Cummings yesterday that he repeatedly lied and that he should have been fired 15 or 20 times over his handling of the early days of the pandemic. Hancock is to answer urgent questions in parliament at 10.30am and will later lead a Downing Street press conference, likely to be around 17.00. French pharmaceutical giant Sanofi and Britain’s GSK have announced the start of final tests of their belated Covid vaccine as they race to add their jab to the world’s arsenal against the pandemic. AFP state that the companies reported positive results from interim human trials earlier this month after a disappointing outcome from initial studies last year left France without its own vaccine. Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline have started enrolment for Phase 3 of a clinical study that will include more than 35,000 adult volunteers at sites in the United States, Asia, Africa and Latin America, the firms said. Sanofi and GSK will also study their vaccine’s ability to work as a booster shot in people who had previously received another vaccine. The Phase 2 trials already showed a strong immune response after a single shot in participants who had previously contracted the coronavirus. The companies hope to launch their vaccine by the end of 2021 - one year after Pfizer and Moderna jabs were approved by regulators. “We have adapted our vaccine development strategy based on forward-looking considerations as the virus continues to evolve, as well as anticipating what may be needed in a post-pandemic setting,” Sanofi executive vice president Thomas Triomphe said in a statement. Like most of the other jabs in circulation, the Sanofi-GSK vaccine would require two doses. Taiwan’s president has accused China of interfering in its vaccine acquisition, as the island continues to battle hundreds of daily new cases of Covid-19 with low supplies of vaccines. Taiwan has received about 700,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine so far, for a population of 24 million. While the island had been largely Covid-free since the pandemic began, an outbreak in late April has so far infected more than 5,000 people, and killed at least 47. Less than 2% of the population are vaccinated. President Tsai Ing-wen said Taiwan had made successful deals for AstraZeneca from the UK and Moderna from the US, and were engaging with Germany’s BioNTech for the Pfizer vaccine. “We had almost completed the contract signing with the German manufacturer at one point, but it has been delayed till now because China has interfered,” Tsai told a party meeting on Wednesday, in the most explicit comments to date, after months of suggestions that Beijing had been getting in the way of Taiwan’s procurement process. Pfizer-BioNTech reportedly has an exclusive deal with the Shanghai-based Fosun pharmaceuticals company to distribute the vaccine to the Greater China region, including Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan. Fosun has offered to supply Taiwan with vaccine doses, but Taiwan has said it is not possible. Beijing denies obstructing Taiwan’s deal with BioNtech and has accused Taiwan’s leaders of sacrificing the health of residents for politics. Taiwan’s opposition Kuomintang party has accused Tsai of bungling the vaccine rollout. “Taiwan access to vaccines continues to be slowed down by Chinese interference, while they insist we buy Chinese-made ones,” said Taiwan’s presidential spokeswoman, Kolas Yotaka. “If you really want to help, please don’t stand in the doorway, don’t block up the hall.” Read more here: Taiwan accuses China of interfering with Covid vaccine deals Professor Susan Michie has ben on Sky News. She is a clinical psychologist at UCL. She described the lack of action and feedback from the UK government on scientific advice as “demoralising” and said that yesterday Dominic Cummings presented a “depressing” picture. She said: As a scientist, spending a lot of my last year, along with many other colleagues, thinking about science, writing about science, providing scientific advice on top of our day jobs, it is quite depressing to think that all that work, and all the many reports that we’ve produced weren’t landing, and possibly weren’t being considered. She went on to say: I think one of the frustrations about having given scientific advice over this last year is that there isn’t feedback … whether it was rejected because it wasn’t thought to be good, or maybe there are other political priorities. One never really knows what the explanation is when the advice we give isn’t being implemented. And I think that’s a shame because I think it’s quite demoralising for scientists. She also made a value for money argument about scientific advice being sidelined, saying: “I think it’s important for the public to know how taxpayers money is being spent, because obviously there’s a substantial expense to serving a big scientific infrastructure.” Professor Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College London, whose modelling was instrumental in persuading the UK government to bring in the first lockdown, said scientists had become increasingly concerned in the week leading up to 13 March 2020 about the lack of a clear plan, and 20,000 to 30,000 lives could have been saved with earlier action. Asked on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme when the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), of which he was part, determined that a policy of pursuing herd immunity would lead to a vast number of deaths, he said a key meeting was held with the NHS on 1 March “which finalised estimates around health impacts, so the week after that really.” PA report Ferguson said he “wasn’t privy to what officials were thinking within government”, but added: “I would say from the scientific side there was increasing concern that week leading up to the 13 of March about the lack of clear, let’s say, (a) resolved plan of what would happen in the next few days in terms of implementing social distancing.” He said: “I think one of the biggest lessons to learn in such circumstances is we really need good surveillance within the country at a much earlier point than we actually had it back in March last year. As we saw the data build up, and it was matching the modelling, even worse than the modelling, let’s say it focused minds”. He then said locking down a week earlier would have saved 20,000 to 30,000 lives “and I think that’s unarguable. I mean the epidemic was doubling every three to four days in weeks 13th to 23rd of March, and so had we moved the interventions back a week we would have curtailed that and saved many lives”. Needless to say, lockdown sceptic Fraser Nelson, editor of the Spectator, is having none of it. From 8am this morning, all adults in Northern Ireland will be able to book a vaccination. Health Minister Robin Swann said: “I am delighted that our vaccination programme is now open to all adults in Northern Ireland. I know this will be very welcome news for young people who have been waiting patiently for their turn to get the jab.” You can check on the latest status of vaccination in all of the UK’s constituent countries here: NHS England NHS Scotland Gov.wales Northern Ireland As part of UK housing minister Robert Jenrick’s media round this morning, he is repeatedly trying to bat away accusations from former adviser Dominic Cummings by saying there will be a full inquiry in due course. This, in turn, is leading to him being pressed on the timing of that. He has roughly indicated “next spring”. The head of a Japanese doctors union on Thursday warned holding the Olympic Games in Tokyo this summer, with tens of thousands of people gathering from around the world, could lead to the development of a new “Olympic” strain of the coronavirus. With people from over 200 nations and territories set to arrive in Tokyo, it will be dangerous to host the Games in July, said Naoto Ueyama, head of the Japan Doctors Union. “All of the different mutant strains of the virus which exist in different places will be concentrated and gathering here in Tokyo. We cannot deny the possibility of even a new strain of the virus potentially emerging after the Olympics,” he told a news conference. “If such a situation were to arise, it could even mean a Tokyo Olympic strain of the virus being named in this way, which would be a huge tragedy and something which would be the target of criticism even for 100 years.” Japan pledged on Thursday to keep in close contact with Olympics stakeholders at home and abroad to ensure a safe and secure Games even as it prepared to extend a state of emergency across much of the nation, including host city Tokyo. Concerns remain rife about the safety of the 2020 Olympics, postponed for a year due to the coronavirus pandemic, with public opinion polls showing a majority of Japanese are opposed to holding the Games this summer amid struggles to control a fourth wave of the coronavirus and sluggish vaccine rollout. Elaine Lies reports for Reuters that the government is currently preparing to extend a state of emergency across much of the nation originally set to be lifted on 31 May, most likely well into June, officials have said - just weeks before the Games are set to open on 23 July. Earlier this week, the United States advised against travel to Japan, but Olympics organisers have said this will not affect the Games. The White House on Wednesday said it had been assured by the Japanese government that it will keep in close contact about concerns over the Olympics. Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato said Japan would continue making every effort to control the virus irrespective of the Olympics, and would be in close contact with concerned parties at home and abroad about the measures being taken in connection with the Games. “Careful anti-infection measures are a crucial part of being able to deliver a safe and secure event,” he told a news conference. “We will maintain close and periodic contact with all those concerned, both within the country and without, to explain what we’re doing on this score.” Robert Jenrick is the UK government minister out on media duties this morning – you can’t imagine he’s going to asked about anything else at all except Dominic Cummings. He’s just been on Sky News where he got quite an abrasive questioning and wasn’t exactly effusive in his defence of health secretary Matt Hancock. Asked if Hancock had lied repeatedly, as Cummings asserted yesterday, Jenrick fell back on standard lines about vaccine rollout and didn’t really address the question. He was pressed: “It’s no good you appearing on this programme if you are not prepared to answer questions, and with the greatest of respect, we’ve heard all about what the government’s doing with the rollout and we hear that every single day. But what people will take from your response to that first answer is you’re not prepared to back the health secretary. Why not?” Jenrick again responded with a fairly generic line, saying “I think that the department for health and the health secretary, have worked exceptionally hard over the course of this pandemic. This was an unprecedented situation, it was a national effort involving all parts of government, and all parts of the country. I think the public will appreciate, if you think back to the events of this time last year, how challenging it really was. Many things happen, of course they’ll be things which we could have done better and we’re learning those lessons as we go along. “The public inquiry will air that and hear the evidence in a reasoned and reflective manner. I think that is the right way to do that. But absolutely, I think the country responded phenomenally to the events of last year. My point was that we are still responding to the pandemic, and that has to be the focus of government right now.” You can watch it here: Alexander Britton at PA has had a quick whizz round the British newspapers to gauge their reactions to the testimony yesterday of former UK government adviser Dominic Cummings on the early days of handling the Covid pandemic. The Independent, i and Daily Mirror all use the same quote headline: “Tens of thousands died who didn’t need to die”, with the latter carrying a leader column headlined “damning testimony”. The paper points out the problem of only hearing one side of the story, but that the Government “failed in this fundamental duty”. It says: “Cummings’ evidence may have been one-sided and selective but it should not be ignored. His criticisms of the Government’s handling of Covid demand an explanation. “The coward Johnson is trying to hide from accountability by delaying the public inquiry into Covid until next spring. We need to learn lessons now, not at his convenience.” The Daily Telegraph takes a different angle, suggesting an element of revenge from Cummings with associate editor Camilla Tominey writing “having expended his nine lives in government, this was also about settling scores”. The Sun’s headline - “Do you need a hindsight test, Mr Cummings?” - pokes fun at his well-publicised trip to Barnard Castle during the pandemic, while its leader column claims Mr Johnson will “dodge Dom’s bombs”. It adds people “recognise that our Government was one of many whose Covid response was found wanting. “The key difference since being the stellar success of our world-leading vaccine rollout. Voters are more likely to credit the Government with that and our rosier future than rake over the terrible bleakness of 2020 and the chaos in Downing Street.” Melbourne’s newest major arts festival, Rising, has been thrown into turmoil the day after opening with the Victorian government announcing a seven-day statewide lockdown from Thursday night. The hotly anticipated winter arts festival opened on Wednesday after an extended wait, only to “hit pause” on Thursday as the city entered a “circuit-breaker” lockdown that closed indoor and outdoor entertainment and arts venues and prohibited public gatherings. The acting premier, James Merlino, announced the lockdown on Thursday morning to halt the spread of what he called a “highly infectious” Covid-19 variant, spreading “faster than ever recorded”. Rising was due to run until Sunday 6 June. At the time of writing, the lockdown was scheduled to run until Friday 4 June. In response to the public health directive, Rising cancelled all events from 5pm Thursday until 4 June and committed to issuing refunds for all tickets for that period. “A decision in relation to events scheduled between 4 June and 6 June will be made over the coming week,” a statement issued by the festival said. Rising had been initially scheduled for 2020 but was cancelled due to the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, which hit Melbourne particularly hard, sending the city into back-to-back lockdowns that extended from March until October, and into a third snap lockdown earlier this year. Read more of Stephanie Convery’s report here: Rising festival ‘hits pause’ the day after opening as Melbourne enters lockdown Good morning from London, it is Martin Belam here. I’ll be with you for the next few hours. We’ve just published this from Dr Deepti Gurdasani, who is a clinical epidemiologist and senior lecturer in machine learning at Queen Mary University of London: Amid the select committee revelations from Dominic Cummings, and in his recent claims on social media, there has been a lot of focus on suggestions that the UK government was following a “herd immunity” policy at the start of the pandemic, costing thousands of lives in the process. Of course, none of this is surprising. It is very clear that this was the flawed policy of the government through early March last year, not least because it was publicly discussed by the prime minister and by many scientific advisers to the government – including Patrick Vallance, who spoke of “enough people becoming immune to this” with mild illness, to help build herd immunity. The alternative strategy of high suppression or elimination of the virus was rejected by the government very early on, despite strong evidence from other countries around the world showing that this could be successfully applied. There were several elements that underpinned the devastating herd immunity strategy. It was believed that infection of large swathes of the population was inevitable, and acceptable, and that there was no way to prevent it. This came with the tacit acknowledgment that hundreds of thousands of deaths were acceptable, most of which would occur among vulnerable and elderly people. A sense of national exceptionalism held by some suggested that other countries’ experiences didn’t apply to us – despite that by March we had had months to observe and learn from countries in south Asia, and seeing the devastating impact of late action in Italy. Real-world evidence was ignored in favour of models and flawed thinking. The government’s strategy repeatedly conflated Covid-19 with flu, ignoring the much higher transmissibility, higher susceptibility, which would lead to many more people getting infected and dying, and unknown long-term impacts from a novel virus. Finally, there was the idea that the health of the economy needed to be balanced with public health. A lot of emphasis was placed on the disruption lockdowns would cause, with attempts to slow down such decisions, without understanding that delays would inevitably lead to even longer lockdowns and more economic damage. Read more here: Deepti Gurdasani – The UK government’s Covid strategy was discredited but we’re still paying the price This is Facebook’s statement on its change of policy: In light of ongoing investigations into the origin of Covid-19 and in consultation with public health experts, we will no longer remove the claim that COVID-19 is man-made or manufactured from our apps. We’re continuing to work with health experts to keep pace with the evolving nature of the pandemic and regularly update our policies as new facts and trends emerge. In February this year, the World Health Organization team that visited Wuhan to investigate the origins of the coronavirus pandemic all but dismissed a theory that the virus leaked from a laboratory. But their investigation was inconclusive as to what the origins of the theory actually were, and the theory that the virus was manufactured in a laboratory and escaped accidentally has again been raised in recent days as the United States and other countries call for a more in-depth investigation of the pandemic’s origins. Determining how the virus that causes Covid-19 began spreading is seen as vital to preventing future outbreaks. A long-delayed report by the team of international experts sent to Wuhan and their Chinese counterparts drew no firm conclusions as to the origins of the pandemic. Instead, they ranked a number of hypotheses according to how likely they believed they were. The report said the virus jumping from bats to humans via an intermediate animal was the most probable scenario, while it said a theory involving the virus leaking from a laboratory was “extremely unlikely”. After the report was released, however, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus insisted all theories remained on the table. On Wednesday, Joe Biden has ordered the US intelligence community to intensify its efforts to study the origins of coronavirus, adding that it will continue to press for China to participate in a full investigation. Biden’s request included asking the US intelligence community to explore the unlikely possibility that the origins of the virus trace to Chinese lab. After months of minimizing the possibility as a fringe theory, the Biden administration is responding both to domestic and geopolitical concerns about putting pressure on China to be transparent about the outbreak.. After months of minimizing the possibility as a fringe theory, the Biden administration is responding both to domestic and geopolitical concerns about putting pressure on China to be transparent about the outbreak. Hello and welcome to our ongoing live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. Facebook has lifted a ban on posts claiming that Covid-19 was “man-made” or “manufactured” in “In light of ongoing investigations into the origin of Covid and in consultation with public health experts”. Here are the other key recent developments: Johnson &amp; Johnson’s single-shot Covid vaccine is to be limited in Belgium to people aged 41 and over, authorities said following the death of a woman who received the jab. Switzerland is to re-open indoor restaurants and people will no longer be required to work from home, the government announced, saying it was lifting restrictions faster than previously planned. China accused the US of “spreading conspiracy theories and disinformation” after health chief Anthony Fauci said he was no longer convinced the coronavirus originated naturally – propelling the theory that it emerged from a Wuhan laboratory back into mainstream debate. The European Commission demanded an urgent court order requiring AstraZeneca to deliver millions more vaccines to the bloc or face a hefty fine, in a case that may reflect its anger more than its need for doses. Slovakia became the second EU country to authorise the use of the Russian-made Sputnik V Covid vaccine, which has not yet been approved by the bloc’s drug regulator. France will impose a compulsory quarantine on travellers arriving from the UK because of growing concerns over the spread of the Indian variant of the coronavirus, the government’s spokesman has said. Whistleblower protection groups urged the World Health Organization to launch an independent review into the case of an Italian researcher who reported being pressured to falsify data in a now-spiked WHO report into Italy’s coronavirus response. Perhaps conveniently for an incumbent candidate, Zambian president Edgar Lungu banned campaign rallies ahead of elections scheduled for 12 August, saying large gatherings risked spreading the Covid-19 virus. Vets in several parts of Russia reportedly started vaccinating cats against Covid-19. Russia in March said it had registered the world’s first coronavirus vaccine for animals. Only two animals in Russia, both cats, have so far tested positive for the virus.","charCount":"55277","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/yohannes-lowe\">Yohannes Lowe</a> (now); <a href=\"profile/rhi-storer\">Rhi Storer</a>, <a href=\"profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a> and <a href=\"profile/helen-sullivan\">Helen Sullivan</a> (earlier)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2021/may/27/world-aviation-body-to-launch-inquiry-into-belarus-hijacking","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-27T16:16:25Z","webTitle":"Russia refuses to allow European planes to land in Moscow","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/27/world-aviation-body-to-launch-inquiry-into-belarus-hijacking","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/may/27/world-aviation-body-to-launch-inquiry-into-belarus-hijacking","fields":{"headline":"Russia refuses to allow European planes to land in Moscow","standfirst":"<p>Retaliation over Belarus airspace row results in cancellation of flights from French and Austrian carriers</p>","trailText":"Retaliation over Belarus airspace row results in cancellation of flights from French and Austrian carriers","byline":"Daniel Boffey in Brussels and Luke Harding","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"544083831f8fc994267b316795e15a5df47c3af2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/544083831f8fc994267b316795e15a5df47c3af2/0_45_5588_3353/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Ryanair Boeing 737-800 lands at Vilnius international airport in Lithuania after being diverted to the Belarusian capital under the escort of a Mig-29 fighter jet.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Ryanair Boeing 737-800 lands at Vilnius airport in Lithuania after being diverted to the Belarusian capital under the escort of a MiG-29 fighter jet.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Russia has retaliated against a ban on carriers entering Belarus’s airspace by refusing to grant permission to European planes flying to Moscow.</p> <p>In an apparent escalation by the Kremlin, Russian aviation authorities on Thursday forced Austrian Airlines to cancel its flight from Vienna to the Russian capital.

In an apparent escalation by the Kremlin, Russian aviation authorities on Thursday forced Austrian Airlines to cancel its flight from Vienna to the Russian capital. Air France also cancelled its Paris-Moscow flight for the second day in a row, after it was denied permission on Wednesday to land in Russia. Both carriers had posted new routes bypassing Belarus. The move follows the “hijacking” on Sunday of a Ryanair plane flying between Greece and Lithuania, and the arrest of two passengers onboard, the journalist Raman Pratasevich and his Russian girlfriend, Sofia Sapega. Air France and Austrian Airlines were following a recommendation by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). It is unclear if Moscow’s retaliation is temporary or signals a more lasting standoff, which could in turn lead to countermeasures against the Russian national carrier Aeroflot. Airlines including British Airways and KLM have been able to use new routes on flights to Moscow. The UN’s International Civil Aviation Organization is meeting on Thursday in Montreal. It is likely to launch a speedy investigation into the Belarus president Alexander Lukashenko’s decision to down Pratasevich’s flight, as governments rush to deter copycat incidents. The 36-member ICAO council will hold an “exceptional session” to “share and review the latest information available, and discuss” the forced grounding of the aircraft in Minsk, a spokesperson said. The ICAO spokesperson said he would not “pre-empt their talks or speculate on what aspects of the incident, of the convention, or of other treaties their discussions may focus on”. But legal experts said an investigation was certain and that Belarus’s eventual expulsion from an international convention facilitating travel by its national airline around the world and by others in its airspace was likely to garner the necessary majority support if Lukashenko and his Moscow-supported regime failed to back down. Elmar Giemulla, an aviation lawyer who represented four German nationals killed in the downing of flight MH17 in Ukraine, said he understood that a full assembly meeting of the ICAO, which meets every three years, would be brought forward to respond to the results of an investigation once ordered by the council. The 1944 Chicago convention establishes common rules of aviation safety and details the rights of its signatories, of which Belarus is one. The ICAO’s members are responsible for enforcing the convention including the safe and secure crossing of flights over national airspace. Belarus has been accused of violating its terms by forcing the pilot of the Ryanair flight to land in Minsk using false claims of a bomb onboard. A MiG-29 fighter jet sent to escort the civilian aircraft to the ground left the pilot without any other option. G7 foreign ministers who will meet next month at a summit in Cornwall called for Pratasevich’s immediate and unconditional release, together with all other journalists and political prisoners. They were considering further sanctions on Belarus, a statement said, with potassium and petrochemicals a likely target. The ministers accused Lukashenko of jeopardising the safety of the passengers and crew and called on the ICAO to urgently address the challenge to its rules and standards. In response, carriers are being asked by national governments to avoid Belarus airspace, and some, such as the UK, have suspended the operating permit of Belavia, effectively banning the Belarusian airline from flying over its territory. Expulsion from the convention would put such measures on a firmer legal basis and leave Belarus in something close to a pariah status in aviation as the safety standards of both its aircraft and ground control would not be automatically recognised. Giemulla said: “The more countries that are members of the club the better international aviation can be performed so to exclude a member is a very hard step. “[Belarus’s expulsion] depends on very much of the position that Mr Lukashenko takes now. If he is very stubborn, says he is master of his house, I’m a sovereign state, then the reaction must be: ‘Sorry you don’t understand: we are talking about international civil aviation and we have to exclude you.’ “The question for the ICAO is not just to punish somebody.

And this has been a very enjoyable little nugget of a partnership which has revived white rose spirits. Patterson giraffe like, elbows and knees, awkward but stoical.

James got the breakthrough </strong>for Nottinghamshire a short while ago, bowling Rob Yates with a lovely inswinger from around the wicket. James looks a genuine prospect to me - as well as depressingly young - and his ability to bat at No6, thus balancing the team, has been a key aspect of their change of fortunes this season. Will Rhodes has moved to 42 not out and the muscular Pieter Malan is alongside him on three, with the home side 57 for one. Injury worry for Notts too, with Ben Duckett going off the field after a ball fell short of slip and struck him on the elbow/forearm.”<br></p> <p>“The ball has swung all morning at Edgbaston and never more so than out of the hand of Steven Mullaney. The Nottinghamshire skipper had been repeatedly moving them away from the right-handed Pieter Malan but you just knew the sucker ball was coming, with Mullaney getting one to hoop back into the South African’s pads on 17. Malan seemed to suggest a hint of inside edge on his way off the park. With Lyndon James earlier bowling Rob Yates, Warwickshire head into lunch on 78 for two and their skipper, Will Rhodes, one short of his half-century.”<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60af93008f08d486a7714b3a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-05-27T12:42:42.466Z\">1.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>They’re back on at Old Trafford</strong>, where the statuesque Patterson is beaten by the rapid Mahmood.

Norfolk had links with Northamptonshire and was invited down for a couple of sessions with David Ripley, who was in charge of their academy at that time. They liked the look of me, I kept going back and it went from there.” </p> <p> “On a couple of occasions I have been coming back from injuries and playing for Norfolk has been a good stepping stone in my rehab. It’s a chance to give something back to Norfolk but I also enjoy it. A lot of the current team I grew up with so it’s a friendly and familiar atmosphere.” </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60af85688f086d71cc15c4b8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-05-27T11:46:34.980Z\">12.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Duke, in his second Yorkshire game,</strong> is only 19.

I’ll leave you with the news that Alex Davies is bludgeoning Yorkshire round the ground. Lancs 41-0. Jennings and Davies making batting look as easy as a slow deep south peach pie. Lancashire 28-0, the sun out and a bowling change as Patterson brings himself on. While at Chester-le-Street, Essex strike with the 16th ball of the innings: Alex Lees lbw to Jamie Porter for a seven-ball duck. Durham 1-1. In normal times, I wouldn’t put my grandad’s ten bob on Durham, but these are not normal times for Essex. Hi-ho, the game racing on at Hove, where Henry Crocombe is having a good day. Fresh from his 46 not out, he has Ben Curran out for 7. Smart catch by Ben Brown. Northants 16-1. The four Yorkshire slips crouch down in unison as Ben Coad charges in. The wind ruffles Jordan Thompson’s trousers as clouds suddenly muffle the sun. Lancashire 5-0, with just under 2000 heads attentively watching each step, each shot. “Just when the afternoon session at Edgbaston was looking barren for Nottinghamshire they go and get the breakthrough, Will Rhodes falling nine runs short of a seventh first-class century to end a grinding stand of 85 with Sam Hain. “Left-arm spinner Liam Patterson-White was the man to strike in the final over before tea, Rhodes pushing it off the face of the bat to Haseeb Hameed at short-leg. England’s latest call-up was delighted with it, and rightly so given the pace on the ball and reflexes required. A bonus in some ways for Nottinghamshire, with the swing on show this morning having faded away and any edges dropping short of the slip cordon. “Rhodes had played a fine hand up to that point but it will be Matt Lamb who walks out with Hain (28 not out off 116 balls) after the break with the score on 163 for three.” Danny Lamb comes on from the Brian Statham end and Luke Wells leaps to snatch a fabulous catch at first slip. D’Olivier is gone for 10 and Yorkshire slope off for an almost respectable 159. Which after their morning, is like a crusty top on top of a pork pie. Tea all round - back in 20 minutes. Group One Riverside: Durham v Essex 182 all out Edgbaston: Warwickshire 163-3 v Nottinghamshire New Road: Worcestershire 214-4v Derbyshire Group Two Grace Road: Leicestershire v Middlesex 156-6* The Oval: Surrey 183-5 v Gloucestershire Group Three Old Trafford: Lancashire v Yorkshire 159 all out Hove: Sussex 175 all out v Northants And Ben Coad, who has thrashed four fours, upper cuts Mahmood for six into the point.I don’t know, another fifty, and, what do you say? It could be a tasty last session. As Anthony writes, “Not good but better than when I left for my art class just before lunch.” Olivier pulls Mahmood for four, clop. Bootiful! I’m sorry to tell you that Middlesex are wobbling - 148-6 - Callum Parkinson out-bowling his brother with 3-58. While at Hove, the up-n-over 9th partnership between Carson and Crocombe is over, but not before they put on 99. Carson, Sanderson’s fifth wicket for 52, Crocombe 45 not out. Snap and a click: three runs later, Duke tries to pull Tom Bailey and is snaffled by Dane Vilas . He marches smartly off, removing his helmet, and is applauded all the way. What a smashing innings, in a Roses match, a pressure situation and in front of the TV cameras. Enjoy being 19 Harry Duke, you lucky thing! Bailey’s figures: 12-9-6-3. Luke Wood is clubbed for six over the cover boundary by Patterson. Huffy, he bowls another short one, and Patterson loafs him for four. But all good things come to an end, and over Patterson blows, falling over facing Matt Parkinson. Smashingly awkward innings of 27, great partnership of 77. Yorkshire 121-8. At the Riverside, Essex are 140-5, as Ryan ten Doeschate has been lbw to Borthwick for eight. Pepper still there, 69 not out. Always good to hear news of Ravi Bopara. Bring shades, the Manchester grass is blinding green in the sun. As a Luke Wood bouncer sails over Harry Duke’s head, I must say how lovely it is to have a crowd. Applause for fielding, applause for bowling changes, applause for a fifty partnership for the eighth wicket - even if they are Yorkies. (There are more than a scattering of Yorkies in). And this has been a very enjoyable little nugget of a partnership which has revived white rose spirits. Patterson giraffe like, elbows and knees, awkward but stoical. Duke, a pint pot full of vim and shots, and, as I say that, he is dropped before picking up his maiden Championship half century. Well played! Patterson shakes his hand mid pitch, they look like father and son. Yorkshire 100-7. Good Afternoon Tanya, Good Afternoon everyone. Good afternoon Em Jackson! “With the news that Olly Stone sometimes turns out for Norfolk in the Minor League, does that not suggest that an FA-Cup T20 style competition is more than doable with the 18 Senior Counties, the top 11 Minor Counties, Cambs. And Oxford Uni Sides and an MCC side (32 &gt; 16 &gt; 8 &gt; 4 &gt; 2 – with the losers playing in a Plate Competition so everyone gets two matches guaranteed). “Also, who is the best player you’ve ever seen playing for their non-First Class/List A regular side, I’m thinking of something like an England Captain rocking up for “Village Green Society 2nd XI” or something. Happy to see Durham succeeding in the mixed bag of weather around Tyne &amp; Wear today I must say.” That’s a good call Em. Problem is, they’ve squeezed about every drop of blood they can out of the calendar at the moment. At New Road, Jack Haynes is unbeaten on 61, after a handy partnership of 53 with Jack Whitely who was out after lunch for 22. Worcs 115-4. Essex 131-4, with Pepper 62 not out. A totter at The Oval. Surrey now 123-3, another wicket now would be numerically pleasing , Patel gone for 62, Smith for 2. A couple of wickets for David Payne. Middlesex have slipped from 52-0 to 91-3, with Robson, Gubbins and Eskinazi pavilion bound. Handscomb, fresh from his runs against Surrey, at the crease and ready to go. Middx 100-3. Parky is on. Yorks 71-7. A big appeal against Duke first ball. Not out. This could be tasty, talk of the ball turning square in practise. I thought Gary had been quiet. Bravo! Sussex are now eight down. But Carson and Crocombe have put on 27 for the ninth wicket, the largest partnership of the match so that’s something, I suppose. Sanderson has 4-31 and Sussex haven’t yet found the magic formula after Jason Gillespie left. During my lunchtime amble, I met Robert Beveridge. He’s 78 and back at Old Trafford for the first time since 2019. “I usually come to every day of every match and I watch league cricket too. It’s been very good to be here - I can’t say too much about the score, I have Yorkshire friends, but let’s just say we’d have taken it at 11 o’clock. “Last year was terrible, its like a drug to me is cricket, it was very sad. It’s not life or death, sadly lots of people would like to be here but can’t because of Covid. I’m one of the lucky ones.” Forgive me Ali, I’ve just discovered your updates in my inbox. Please pretend these are live everyone: “Lyndon (B?) James got the breakthrough for Nottinghamshire a short while ago, bowling Rob Yates with a lovely inswinger from around the wicket. James looks a genuine prospect to me - as well as depressingly young - and his ability to bat at No6, thus balancing the team, has been a key aspect of their change of fortunes this season. Will Rhodes has moved to 42 not out and the muscular Pieter Malan is alongside him on three, with the home side 57 for one. Injury worry for Notts too, with Ben Duckett going off the field after a ball fell short of slip and struck him on the elbow/forearm.” “The ball has swung all morning at Edgbaston and never more so than out of the hand of Steven Mullaney. The Nottinghamshire skipper had been repeatedly moving them away from the right-handed Pieter Malan but you just knew the sucker ball was coming, with Mullaney getting one to hoop back into the South African’s pads on 17. Malan seemed to suggest a hint of inside edge on his way off the park. With Lyndon James earlier bowling Rob Yates, Warwickshire head into lunch on 78 for two and their skipper, Will Rhodes, one short of his half-century.” They’re back on at Old Trafford, where the statuesque Patterson is beaten by the rapid Mahmood. I didn’t mention it before lunch but Duke raced along in the last quarter of an hour, five boundaries in his 24 not out, including a dribblingly gorgeous cover drive. Time for a plate of curry and a quick stroll around Old Trafford. Back in half an hour! Group One Riverside: Durham v Essex 91-3 Edgbaston: Warwickshire 78-2 v Nottinghamshire New Road: Worcestershire 98-3 v Derbyshire Group Two Grace Road: Leicestershire v Middlesex 73-1 The Oval: Surrey 77-1 v Gloucestershire Group Three Old Trafford: Lancashire v Yorkshire 57-7 Hove: Sussex 67-7 v Northants Thompson fends desperately at a short ball from Wood, and it carries to Keaton Jennings at short leg - just positioned by Vilas. Happy days for Lancashire. Yorkshire 40-7. Some nice quotes by Olly Stone on playing for Norfolk. Stone first played cricket for his local club Vauxhall Mallards, near Norwich, his first junior county cricket for Norfolk - who recommended him to Northamptonshire – and his formative senior county cricket for Norfolk in the Minor Counties Championship – now National Counties Championship – ten years ago. And despite his Warwickshire and England commitments, Stone has carried on playing for Norfolk whenever he can. “Norfolk have played a massive part in my development but it’s not just me, there are other good young cricketers who have come out of the county,” Stone said.“I started playing cricket because my brothers played but I got into the Norfolk age group sides and then it became a bit more serious. “It was Steve Goldsmith who said that if took it seriously then I had a chance of progressing. Norfolk had links with Northamptonshire and was invited down for a couple of sessions with David Ripley, who was in charge of their academy at that time. They liked the look of me, I kept going back and it went from there.” “On a couple of occasions I have been coming back from injuries and playing for Norfolk has been a good stepping stone in my rehab. It’s a chance to give something back to Norfolk but I also enjoy it. A lot of the current team I grew up with so it’s a friendly and familiar atmosphere.” Duke, in his second Yorkshire game, is only 19. If he could just creep to double figures, to 25, to 50, what a game this would be. Yorkshire 36-6. Duke leans back and glides Wood to the boundary. Sweet. Yorkshire 31-6. Warwicks have lost Rob Yates for a slow 8, but Will Rhodes is steaming ahead, 34 not out. Warwicks 46-1. Pepper and Walter have put on 42 in quick time, Essex 82-3. Jake Libby, carelessly, has been run out, leaving Worcestershire 81-3. Robson and Eskinazi have put on fifty at Grace Road, as have Stoneman and Patel at The Oval. Sussex are 55 -5- 6 ! Ahem. 21-6. Bess cuts to gully - and why not? - where a delighted Danny Lamb accepts, jumps into his teammates arms, and Yorkshire are 21-5. Yorkshire’s lowest total at Old Trafford in a Championship match is 51. Whistles innocently. A drop falls through the hands of first slip, and Kohler Cadmore gets a second life. Yorkshire 20-4. “Greetings from sunny - when isn’t it? - Edgbaston, where spectators are back and delivering the sweet, sweet sound of applause after an 18-month silence at the ground. No early look at Haseeb Hameed after his call-up to the England squad but Notttinghamshire’s opening bowlers are probing away nicely. Will Rhodes, the Warwickshire captain, has already been given a life on six too: Luke Fletcher finding the edge of the lefthander’s bat, only for Tom Moores to put it down diving to his left. Tough chance. After running through Worcestershire like a bull through Pamplona, Fletcher looks in a fine groove, while Zak Chapple has got some lavish swing at the other end. But Rhodes and Rob Yates are holding firm on 28 for no loss after 12 overs.” Hard to glance away from this Yorks-up but, an hour in, a peek round the grounds. Easy pickings for Warwicks (32-0); Middlesex (33-0) and Surrey (36-0). Worcestershire have recovered from 21-2, Libby 24 not out, Hayes 18 not out. 56-2/ Ben Sanderson has snatched three for 16 against wobbling Sussex, 32-4; and Browne and Westley have joined SirAlastair back in the pavilion at The Riverside, Essex 49-3. Let’s keep it cheeky Yorkshire - why not?. Hill prods awkwardly and is caught for 2 off Tom Bailey. Lovely bit of bowling; nervous bit of batting. Yorkshire 11-4. A foolish single ends in disaster: Brook is slow to respond to Kohler Cadmore’s call, fatally hesitates, and is the victim of a direct hit from Davies. Yorkshire 9-3. A satisfied hum starts to rise above Old Trafford. A second for Mahmood! A sensational ball in a smashing spell as a disconsolate Fraine totters head-down back to the pavilion. I don’t think it is unjust to say that Lancashire’s “second string” bowlers are better than Yorkshire’s “second string” batters. Elsewhere, Daryl Mitchell has been lbw to Conners without a run to his name. Not a pretty season for him so far. Worcestershire 19-1. Sussex have lost Aaron Thomason to Ben Sanderson for four. Sussex 12-1. And another early exit for Alastair Cook, lbw to Chris Rushworth for 2, Essex 25-1. And that IS out! Adam Lyth smartly caught by Danny Lamb off Tom Bailey for 4 . A fragile batting line up is cracked open. Billowing clouds peep above the pavilion, as Mahmood has the ball, running in with four slips, Dane Vilas still keeping because Al Davies’ fingers are sore. Lancashire haven’t beaten Yorkshire at home since 2000, when Sourav Ganguly and Darren Lehman were the overseas players. Ah - I think Liam Livingstone just dropped Kohler-Cadmore on 0 off Mahmood. Yorkshire 4-0. Group One - the Notts revival Nottinghamshire 97 (played 6) Essex 88 (played 7) Durham 85 (played 6) Warwicks 78 (played 6) Worcs 71 (played 7) Derby 54 (played 6) Group Two - tight, tight tight Gloucestershire 105 (played 6) Somerset 104 (played 7) Hampshire 94 (played 7) Surrey 79 (played 7) Middlesex 55 (played 7) Leicestershire 51 (played 7) Group 3 - top two running away with it Lancashire 101 (played 6) Yorkshire 98 (played 6) Glamorgan 80 (played 7) Northants 76 (played 6) Sussex 64 (played 6) Kent 61 (played 7) And here is Ali’s piece on England’s selection wobble - Ben Foakes out after a dressing-room slip, Haseeb Hameed and Sam Billings called up. The Hameed selection must have been made in conjunction with Nottinghamshire - I hope they know what they are doing. A complaint from the press box: “What does Adam Lyth have to do?” I’ve just seen a man in the crowd with no shirt on. A lovely piece here by Andy Bull: Yorkshire have won the toss and will bat. Ballance is out with a calf injury sustained in training. There is no David Willey but Dom Bess plays, as does Parkinson for Lancashire. Mahmood replaces Anderson. There is no Root, Bairstow or Anderson as they are now in the England bubble preparing for the Test against New Zealand. Group One Riverside: Durham v Essex Edgbaston: Warwickshire v Nottinghamshire New Road: Worcestershire v Derbyshire Group Two Grace Road: Leicestershire v Middlesex The Oval: Surrey v Gloucestershire Group Three Old Trafford: Lancashire v Yorkshire Hove: Sussex v Northants Good morning! It’s Old Trafford, it’s the 221st Roses Championship match and, at a push, a heat haze razzles out across Manchester. In the car park, a man carefully pulls open the boot, folds his jacket over his arm, and pick up his picnic bag. Lancashire are playing volleyball, Yorkshire playing football, and around the edges in scattered twos, but mostly ones, sits a crowd.","charCount":"15930","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/tanyaaldred\">Tanya Aldred</a> at Old Trafford"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2021/may/27/manchester-united-eye-moves-for-sancho-rice-kane-and-pau-torres","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-27T16:00:31Z","webTitle":"Manchester United eye moves for Sancho, Rice, Kane and Pau Torres","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/may/27/manchester-united-eye-moves-for-sancho-rice-kane-and-pau-torres","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2021/may/27/manchester-united-eye-moves-for-sancho-rice-kane-and-pau-torres","fields":{"headline":"Manchester United eye moves for Sancho, Rice, Kane and Pau Torres","standfirst":"<ul><li>Ole Gunnar Solskjær keen to strengthen squad</li><li>Jadon Sancho the most likely to arrive at Old Trafford<br></li></ul>","trailText":"Ole Gunnar Solskjær is keen to strengthen Manchester United’s squad with high-profile recruits including the England captain Harry Kane and Jadon Sancho","byline":"Jamie Jackson","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"58fb36db5d0cc7f2a8737d6a8878a724c884be2f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/58fb36db5d0cc7f2a8737d6a8878a724c884be2f/0_72_5166_3100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dortmund and England’s Jadon Sancho is on Manchester United’s wanted list.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dortmund and England’s Jadon Sancho is on Manchester United’s wanted list.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John MacDougall/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Ole Gunnar Solskjær wants to strengthen Manchester United in the centre-back, midfield, wide attacker and No 9 positions, with Pau Torres, Declan Rice, Jadon Sancho and Harry Kane among his preferred targets.</p> <p>Although the manager is conscious that adding four major signings is unlikely given an estimated total cost of more than £300m and the availability of any particular player, he is intent at least on pursuing one in each of his identified areas to bolster a squad that requires an upgrade in quality and depth.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2021/may/27/solskjaer-manchester-united-lack-of-a-cohesive-attacking-structure-brutally-exposed\">Solskjær’s lack of a cohesive attacking structure has been brutally exposed | Jonathan Wilson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even if United had beaten Villarreal in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/may/26/villarreal-manchester-united-europa-league-final-2021-match-report\" title=\"\">Wednesday’s Europa League final</a> – they went down 11-10 on penalties – Solskjær would have adhered to the same recruitment policy.

Although the manager is conscious that adding four major signings is unlikely given an estimated total cost of more than £300m and the availability of any particular player, he is intent at least on pursuing one in each of his identified areas to bolster a squad that requires an upgrade in quality and depth. Even if United had beaten Villarreal in Wednesday’s Europa League final – they went down 11-10 on penalties – Solskjær would have adhered to the same recruitment policy. Of the identified quartet the purchase of Borussia Dortmund’s Sancho is currently the most likely to occur and Kane’s the most remote, with Manchester City viewed as favourites to sign Tottenham’s Premier League Golden Boot winner. United priced the total deal for Sancho at close to €250m last summer including wages and an agent fee. West Ham would demand as much as £100m for Rice, whom they have no plans to sell, and Villarreal’s Torres is priced at about €30m, according to reports in Spain. Real Madrid’s centre-back Raphaël Varane is also on United’s radar, with the Frenchman’s value in the region of £60m. It is thought the 35-year-old former United goalkeeper Tom Heaton is close to rejoining the club. His contract at Aston Villa expires next month.","charCount":"1450","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/jamiejackson\">Jamie Jackson</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"}]}}

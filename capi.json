The world No 1 and 2019 Roland Garros champion is out of the French Open, having carried a hip injury into that match with Magda Linette: Monfils breaks in the first game of the second set! The Frenchman is finally on the board, and wins that game including the longest rally of the match, a 24-shot affair. However, he seems to stretch somewhat gingerly at the changeover, appearing perhaps to be testing out a calf muscle. Monfils is back on court following a check by the medics. It is not clear what’s wrong, but his mobility was clearly hindered in that first set. Ymer took the first set 6-0, now will he encounter stronger resistance from the French hopeful in the second? Ymer wins the first set, 6-0. Is Monfils injured? I guess we will find out in the next few minutes, if he has a problem of some sort. He has a problem on the scoreboard, that is for sure. Monfils is taking a medical time-out, and while he’s waiting, Ymer gets some ice on his legs. Elsewhere in the men’s singles: Kohlschreiber has taken the first set against Karatsev, 6-3, while Diego Schwartzman (10th seed) is currently 5-3 to the good in the first set against Aljaž Bedene. Make that 5-0 to Ymer. Monfils needs to think about regrouping for the second set. Ymer moves 4-0 up on Monfils in the first set! It looks like Monfils, the 34-year-old, can kiss goodbye to the first set. Ymer is ranked 105 and Monfils is ranked 15, so this would amount to a hell of an upset if the 22-year-old Swede can stay on top of his vastly experienced opponent. An accomplished win for the Italian, seeing off his Uruguyan opponent in straight sets. The men’s ninth seed is safely into the third round. Now, our friends at Eurosport have switched to coverage of the men’s singles and Mikael Ymer’s second-round clash with Gaël Monfils, who is seeded 14. The Swedish 22-year-old Ymer has Monfils firmly on the back foot right now, 3-0 and a break up in the first set! “Over the course of their lives, people who are managing mental illness learn in the most debilitating, exhausting way that engaging with a distressing situation doesn’t snap you out of distress. It locks you into it.” Here is Van Badham on Naomi Osaka and the Japanese player’s Roland Garros withdrawal following her stated intention not to speak to the media during the tournament: In case you missed it, here is Tumaini Carayol’s report from yesterday’s action, including Serena Williams’s three-set success against Mihaela Buzarnescu: It’s all over. What a shame for the world No 1 Barty. She was hitting the ball well enough, but clearly her mobility was too much of an issue with the hip injury, and she has decided that enough is enough. Barty took a medical time-out between sets and that appeared to have helped her cause: the 25-year-old was striking her serves more powerfully at the start of the second set. But her Roland Garros campaign is over for another year. Joy for Magda Linette, who performed admirably in the first set to take it 6-1, and there were warm words from Barty at the net after she called time on the match. Barty winds up a couple of powerful forehands. The Australian’s power is too much for Linette, on that occasion - and now Barty finds a deep backhand return to force 30-30 on the Pole’s serve. Linette, however, moves 40-30 up and then ends the game with an ace ... but Barty retires! Barty is striking her serves powerfully enough, and wins her latest service game to move 2-1 up in the second set. Linette’s level seemed to drop a bit there - the Polish player needs to shake off any lingering effects of the medical time-out for Barty and re-find her first-set form. Karolina Muchova - seeded 18 - has seen off the challenge of Varvara Lepchenko in straight sets: 6-3, 6-4. Linette holds her own serve against Barty now, including a couple of aces. There is a noticeable lack of intensity in the match, a lack of rhythm, which is only to be expected given Barty’s physical struggles. The Eurosport commentators observe that Barty is trying to keep the points as short as possible and reduce the stress on that hip injury. Barty holds serve comfortably - appearing to move a little more comfortably, too - and now leads 1-0 in the second set. Linette will serve with new balls. On Court 7, Philipp Kolschreiber is under way against Aslan Karatsev, the Australian Open finalist. Barty’s back on court, meanwhile, and the second set against Linette has begun. A medical time-out for Barty now. Worrying times for the Australian world No 1. She is being taken off the court. Not looking good. Last year’s beaten finalist, Sofia Kenin (4), has now beaten Hailey Baptiste: 7-5, 6-3, and she moves into the third round. Meanwhile the Italian Berrettini, in the men’s singles, is two sets to the good against Coria of Uruguay: 6-3, 6-3. And here’s a Twitter video of Elina Svitolina spinning to victory against Ann Li. Magda Linette wins the first set against Ash Barty, 6-1. Barty is clearly in some discomfort - and did not try to hide the fact, pre-tournament, that she is not 100 per cent fit. Linette leads Barty 5-1! Barty has been significantly troubled by her hip injury, according to the commentators on the telly, and the Polish player Linette will now serve for the first set. Linette, who comes from Poznan in western Poland, is ranked 45, in case you were wondering. The 28th-seed Jessica Pegula has just closed out a 6-3, 6-3 win against Tereza Martinicova and she is into the third round. Ons Jabeur, the 25th seed, has defeated Astra Sharma 6-2, 6-4. Jabeur will be waiting for Barty in the third round if Barty wins her second-round match in which she currently trails 4-1. Eurosport are now going to join the action on Philippe-Chatrier, where the No 1 seed Ash Barty is currently 3-1 down against her Polish opponent Magda Linette. That means we are going to join the action there, too, in case you were wondering, and of course I’ll try to stay across all the other scores as much as possible. By the way, you can email me or tweet me with your thoughts on the action if you like: Email here, or tweet @LukeMcLaughlin. C’est bon. Ann Li is ranked 75, and will feel she missed a big chance here against the world No 6: there is no doubt she had Svitolina on the ropes at 4-1 up in the second set. But the fifth-seeded Ukrainian fought back in style and she moves into the third round. Li played some tremendous stuff there, and it was all the more eye-catching after she was blown away in the first set. Positives to take out of that for Li. A horrid mishit from Li, and Svitolina suddenly has two break points. She wins the first one thanks to a positive, attacking return, and she’s now 5-4 up and about to serve for the match. It looks like Li’s fightback is over, unless she can find something special in the next game. Svitolina eventually wins her service game! We are now at 4-4 and the Ukrainian has reminded Li that she is still very much up for this battle. Li wasted a couple of break points there but still has every chance of forcing a deciding set. Absolutely stunning stuff from Li, a searing forehand winner down the line, which forces her second break point of the game. She is targeting Svitolina’s second serve consistently. But she hits long on the next point, and we’re back to deuce. Svitolina’s power and precision is starting to tell again, and Li has made a couple of bad errors including double-faulting in her previous service game. However, Li grinds out an excellent point to force deuce on Svitolina’s serve in this eighth game of the second set ... Svitolina breaks! Thanks to a double fault from Li, it’s back to 4-3 in the second. A significant blow for the fifth-seeded Ukrainian but still plenty of work for her to do. What else? Kenin is 3-0 up on Baptiste in their second set, while the world No 1 Ash Barty has just started her match against Magda Linette on Philippe-Chatrier. Li spices up the longest rally of the match with a sliced backhand. Svitolina, clearly feeling the heat from her reinvigorated opponent, subsequently butchers a deep forehand return a few shots later, sending it tamely wide. Both players are seeing the ball nicely now, finding their groove, and the rallies are warming up. Svitolina looks noticeably stressed between points, all the more so having been in such firm control in the first. The Svitolina of the first set looked set to reappear and dominate her service game - Li fought back to 40-30 - but then coughed up an easy chance for Svitolina to make it 4-2 in this second set. In the men’s, Kwon Soon-woo wins his first set against Seppi, 6-4. Elsewhere: Kenin (seeded fourth) fights her way to a 7-5 set victory against Baptiste, while Muchova takes the first, 6-3, against Lepchenko. Li wins her service game from deuce and goes 4-1 up in the second. It’s hard to overstate how well the American has done to fight back into this match. I said it would be a massive surprise to see anything other than a straight-sets win for Svitolina, and it appears we’re in for a massive surprise. Li sweetly strikes a couple more impressively deep forehands to create a point-winning chance, with a seemingly easy smash to finish, but she sends it long and it’s 30-30 on her service game. Still, what is so impressive is how Li has taken control of most of these exchanges after being blown away in the first set. Elsewhere in the women’s singles: Ons Jabeur of Tunisia (25 seed) takes her first set against Astra Sharma, 6-2, while Jessica Pegula has taken the first set 6-3 against the Czech Tereza Martinicova. Svitolina, meanwhile, steadies the ship and gets a foothold in the second set, which Li now leads 3-1. Wow! A long rally of crushing ground strokes from both players ends with a stunning drop-shot winner by Li, stretching to her right. Svitolina, suddenly, is ashen-faced and battling for every point. It’s 3-0 Li! She looks a different player, with the confidence to craft and shape her shots around the court, in stark contrast to the first set, when she was blown away by Svitolina. Lovely stuff. “So this is going to be 6-0, 0-6, 7-6,” quips the commentator, before remembering that there isn’t a tie-break in the third ... Ann Li, suddenly, is firmly in this match. She breaks for 2-0, striking the ball with authority throughout that service game from Svitolina. There was an aggressive, precise backhand return winner and another sumptuous forehand, and this is a really impressive recovery from the 20-year-old American. Berrettini, seeded ninth, takes that first set against Coria, 6-3. The Italian Berrettini (9) is well on the way to winning the first set against Coria in the men’s singles, forcing a break point at 5-3 up. Li, meanwhile, is on the board! She holds serve and leads 1-0 in the second set against Svitolina. Well played. Svitolina wins the first set against Li, 6-0, closing it out with an immaculate service game. It would be a massive surprise to see anything other than a regulation straight-sets win for Svitolina, the fifth-seeded Ukrainian. Li - who is 20, and was born somewhere pleasingly named ‘King of Prussia’ in Pennsylvania - has now established herself in this match to some extent. She just forced a couple of game points on her serve, and impressively saved a couple of break points too, but her opponent eventually wore her down, and has created a 5-0 first-set lead. Very, very strong stuff from Svitolina: one crushing double-handed backhand down the line was particularly eye-catching there. But Li does at least have something to work with now in the second set. Svitolina is now serving for the first set. Svitolina 4-0 up against Li: it’s one-way traffic at the moment. Elsewhere in the women’s singles, Sofia Kenin (4) and Hailey Baptiste are 2-2 in their first set, Karolina Muchova (18) is 2-1 up on Varvara Lepchenko. Matteo Berrettini (9) leads Federico Coria 3-2 in their men’s singles second-round encounter while Kwon Soon-woo and Andreas Seppi are on serve at 1-1. Elina Svitolina (fifth seed) is taking care of business against Ann Li: She has roared into a 3-0 first-set lead, with a double break of serve, in double-quick time. Li tries a subtle drop, but gets it horribly wrong, which sums up how this first set has gone for the American so far. Might today prove to be Roger Federer’s last stand at Roland Garros? With all due respect to his opponent, Marin Cilic of Croatia, most of us will be hoping not. Federer defeated Uzbekistan’s Denis Istomin in straight sets on Monday, an encouraging return to grand-slam action following a knee injury, while Cilic eased past Frenchman Arthur Rinderknech to set up today’s second-round meeting, which begins at 3pm. Plenty to keep us all occupied before that, of course: Novak Djokovic will be in action from 1.30pm, against Pablo Cuevas of Uruguay. This morning, Sofia Kenin is about to get her match against Hailey Baptiste under way, while Elina Svitolina has just kicked off against Ann Li on Court Suzanne Lenglen, and Ashleigh Barty faces Magda Linette of Poland from 11am on Philippe-Chatrier. This evening, there is the small matter of Rafael Nadal v Richard Gasquet in the men’s singles. I’ll bring you as much detail on all the action as humanly possible until 6pm or so: Let’s go!","charCount":"13331","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/luke-mclaughlin\">Luke McLaughlin</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/live/2021/jun/03/oil-demand-rises-services-uk-economy-ftse-us-jobless-claims-meme-stocks-amc-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-03T11:34:15Z","webTitle":"Wages rise as UK service sector growth hits 24-year high – business live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2021/jun/03/oil-demand-rises-services-uk-economy-ftse-us-jobless-claims-meme-stocks-amc-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2021/jun/03/oil-demand-rises-services-uk-economy-ftse-us-jobless-claims-meme-stocks-amc-business-live","fields":{"headline":"Wages rise as UK service sector growth hits 24-year high – business live","standfirst":"<p>Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial news</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2021/jun/03/oil-demand-rises-services-uk-economy-ftse-us-jobless-claims-meme-stocks-amc-business-live?page=with:block-60b8aeb78f082e80569f4d7a#block-60b8aeb78f082e80569f4d7a\">Latest: More people move off furlough</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2021/jun/03/oil-demand-rises-services-uk-economy-ftse-us-jobless-claims-meme-stocks-amc-business-live?page=with:block-60b8947e8f082e80569f4bf1#block-60b8947e8f082e80569f4bf1\">UK service sector PMI highest since 1997</a><br></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2021/jun/03/oil-demand-rises-services-uk-economy-ftse-us-jobless-claims-meme-stocks-amc-business-live?page=with:block-60b89da98f08b9889b36779c#block-60b89da98f08b9889b36779c\">Wages rise amid scramble for staff</a></li><li>Markit: UK seeing ‘eye-popping’ growth this quarter</li></ul><p>Earlier:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2021/jun/03/oil-demand-rises-services-uk-economy-ftse-us-jobless-claims-meme-stocks-amc-business-live?page=with:block-60b86c328f08b9889b367579#block-60b86c328f08b9889b367579\">Introduction: Brent crude highest since 2019</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-oil-api/api-shows-crude-stockpiles-fell-last-week-sources-idUSKCN2DE2Q7\">API shows crude stockpiles fell last week -

There were 3,435,400 people on the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) at the end of April, down from 4,319,100 at the end of March, HMRC reports. The largest decline came in the wholesale and retail sector, which had 234,500 fewer jobs on furlough following the reopening of shops in April. There were also large reductions in the number of people furloughed at accommodation and food services, and arts and entertainment companies, although take-up rates still remain high across these sectors, HMRC adds. At the end of April, there were still an estimated 602,800 people furloughed in the wholesale and retail sector, 932,600 in accommodation and food services, 246,300 in manufacturing, 166,600 in construction, and 230,200 in arts and entertainment. The government has welcomed the drop, saying that 11.5 million employees and 1.3 million employers have now been supported by CJRS (which pays 80% of wages to people currently not needed at work due to the pandemic). Resolution Foundation have calculated that take-up of the Job Retention Scheme has reached two billion days [the total number of employments furloughed each day since the start of March 2020, including weekends]. Dan Tomlinson, Senior Economist at the Resolution Foundation, says: “Employees have clocked up two billion days’ worth of furlough since the start of the pandemic. This shows just how big an impact the pandemic has had on the economy – and how vital the furlough scheme has been in term of preventing mass unemployment. “The continued fall in furlough rates during April as the economy began to reopen is an encouraging indicator that the labour market – as well as the wider economy – is recovering quickly. “But with around one-in-six young workers still on furlough at the end of April, today’s figures are a stark reminder of the risk of rising unemployment when the furlough scheme ends. The Government must do all it can to ensure those workers find work as quickly as possible.” The number of UK firms open for business is now the highest since the first wave of Covid-19, as lockdown restrictions are lifted. The Office for National Statistics reports that the percentage of businesses currently trading has increased to 87%, the highest proportion since comparable estimates began in June 2020. Another 3% of firms plan to restart trading in the next two weeks, it found. Around 6.3% of firms have paused and don’t expect to reopen in a fortnight, while 3.8% of those surveyed have ceased trading. The biggest change came in the accommodation and food service sector -- where the proportion of companies currently operating has jumped to 61% to 83%, following the reopening of hospitality venues for indoor dining last month. In the transportation and storage industry, the proportion of firms currently trading rose from 67% to 75%. Britain’s pubs have warned they face ‘serious’ staff shortages, having reopened after the lockdown. The British Beer &amp; Pub Association say some landlords have been forced to greatly cut their service, or shut altogether. It has written to employment minister, Mims Davies, urging the Government to urgently do what it can to help the sector with such staff shortages. The BBPA say several factors are to blame. Covid-19 restrictions are more labour-intensive, as you need more staff to run table service, for example. EU nationals not returning to the UK is another factor, they add. The BBPS also wants the government to expand the Youth Mobility Scheme to cover more nations -- currently, this visa scheme is only open to 18-30 yea- olds from Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Japan, Monaco, New Zealand, Republic of Korea, San Marino and Taiwan. It is also pushing for a “more flexible approach to immigration” by reviewing the shortage occupation list, to help pubs hire. Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer &amp; Pub Association, explains: “Our pubs face a serious staffing shortage that has become acute. In some instances pubs are having to reduce capacity or close entirely because they don’t have the staff to open. This is a major concern for our sector as it is hindering its recovery after lockdown. At our heart we are a people business and we need good people to provide the best hospitality. Even before the crisis, pubs in some areas were struggling to find the staff with the skills they need, particularly chefs and kitchen staff. As they reopen and begin their recovery, some have found staff have either moved away or found jobs in other sectors. IHS Markit also reports that the wider UK private sector grew at the fastest pace since its survey began in January 1998. This is based on data from the service sector and manufacturing (which posted record growth in May earlier this week). The surge in demand since reopening has left service sector firms scrambling to find staff -- and forcing some to lift pay to attract staff. Today’s services PMI report shows that payroll numbers rose at the fastest pace since March 2015, with survey respondents citing a combination of new hires and the return of employees from furlough. Many companies reported difficulties with staff availability, especially among consumer service providers, Markit says. And with labour in short supply, some companies are paying higher salaries -- a boost to workers. The PMI report says: Tighter labour market conditions and subsequent rises in salary payments added to cost pressures across the service economy in May. Duncan Brock, Group Director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, says a shortfall of talent is driving up pay. Businesses rushed to increase their operational capacity to meet this demand but were struggling to fill their job vacancies. As staff moved on to other opportunities following the pandemic’s impact on lives and priorities, a potential skills gap in the sector means some firms may struggle to meet their new goals. This shortfall in talent meant the best candidates were increasingly in demand and demanding higher wages, adding to the highest inflationary rise in business costs since July 2008. We will see more pressure for salary rises, as basic living becomes more expensive for everyone as the hike in prices charged by service companies was the highest since 1996.” The UK economy is enjoying “eye-popping” growth as services companies see a surge in demand after lockdown restrictions were eased. Activity at UK service providers jumped in May at the fastest rate in 24 years, according to the latest survey of purchasing managers at UK services firms. Companies reported resurgent business and consumer spending last month, with new orders rising at the fastest pace since October 2013. This encouraged them to take on more staff, with the strongest rate of employment growth for just over six years. Backlogs of work also built up due to a jump in forward bookings, stretched capacities and staff shortages. Covid-19 restrictions were eased in mid-May, meaning that pubs and restaurants could serve indoors. Other other hospitality venues also reopened. This followed the earlier reopening of non-essential shops in April. But this jump in demand is also pushing costs up. Input price inflation reached its highest since July 2008, and companies raised their own prices at the fastest rate since the survey began in 1996. This lifted IHS Markit’s Services PMI up to 62.9 in May, from 61.0 in April. Any reading over 50 shows growth, and this level implies the economy is growing extremely fast after contracting in the first quarter of the year. Its suggests the fastest rate in business activity since May 1997 -- the month in which Tony Blair became prime minister. Tim Moore, economics director at IHS Markit, says the successful Covid-19 vaccine rollout is boosting the economy, and implying very strong growth this quarter. “UK service providers reported the strongest rise in activity for nearly a quarter-century during May as the roll back of pandemic restrictions unleashed pent up business and consumer spending. The latest survey results set the scene for an eye-popping rate of UK GDP growth in the second quarter of 2021, led by the reopening of customer-facing parts of the economy after winter lockdowns. “Pressure on business capacity due to a spike in demand and staff hiring difficulties emerged as a major challenge for service sector companies in May. Job creation was the strongest for over six years, but backlogs of work accumulated to the greatest extent since the summer of 2014. “The successful vaccine roll out has generated a strong willingness to spend and fortified business optimism across the service economy. However, inflationary trends intensified in May as suppliers passed on higher transport bills, staff costs and raw material prices. Imbalanced demand and supply appears to have spread beyond the manufacturing sector, which contributed to the steepest rise in prices charged by service providers since the survey began in July 1996.” Services firms across the euro area have posted their strongest growth in almost three years. With economies reopening from the lockdown, firms reported an increase in output growth, and a rise in volumes of new business for the first time since last July, date firm IHS Markit reports. Backlogs of work rose, encouraging companies to take on additional staff for the fourth month running -- with employment rising at the fastest rate since February 2020 This lifted Markit’s Eurozone services PMI to 55.2 in May, up from 50.5 in April, and the highest level in almost three years. Ireland and Spain reported the fastest services growth, followed by France, while Germany recorded the slowest expansion. The wider eurozone private sector grew at its fastest pace since February 2018, Markit adds, due to strong growth in the manufacturing. Ireland posted the strongest PMI since the survey began 21 years ago. London estate agent Foxtons is also bouncing back from the pandemic. Foxtons told the City that trading momentum has remained strong since its last trading update on 14 April, with sales running ahead of pre-Covid levels. Following a 49% increase in Foxtons Q1 sales revenue versus both 2020 and 2019, the sales commission pipeline has continued to grow and is now 65% ahead of last year and 17% up on 1 January 2021. As a result of the strong trading momentum, adjusted operating profit for the first half of the year is expected to be significantly ahead of both 2020 and 2019. Foxtons faced a shareholder backlash in April, with 44% of investors failing to back its remuneration report after it awarded CEO Nic Budden almost £1m in bonuses, despite taking £4.4m of furlough money and £2.5m in business rates relief. The London stock market has dipped in early trading, dropping from yesterday’s three-week highs. The blue-chip FTSE 100 index is down 47 points or almost 0.7% at 7060 points. Retail stocks are lower, with discounter B&amp;M down 1.7% despite reporting that pretax profits doubled last year after it stayed open during the lockdown. B&amp;M reported that “trading continues to be volatile at a weekly and product category level, in particular since the recent easing of lockdown restrictions.”. DIY chain Kingfisher are down 2.6%, after going ex-dividend this morning (it’s too late to qualify for the next payout to shareholders). National Grid also went ex-divi today; they’re down 4.7%. Travel companies are among the fallers too, with British Airways parent company IAG down 2.5%. Budget airline easyJet have dropped 2.8% (on the smaller FTSE 250 index), amid reports that Portugal could potentially be removed from the UK’s green list, which allows travellers from those countries into England without having to self-isolate on arrival. The government is set to announce revisions to the travel traffic-light system on Thursday, but Whitehall sources expect just a “handful of new places” to be given quarantine-free travel – few of which are tourist destinations... Growth at China’s service sector companies slowed slightly last month. The Caixin services PMI, which racks China’s services firms, fell to 55.1 in May, down from 56.3 in April. That still shows rapid growth, with business activity and new orders up sharply -- but softening compared to April. Caixin says the Covid-19 pandemic appears to have hit exports last month. According to panel members, customer demand continued to recover due to the successful containment of COVID-19 in China, while there were also reports of new product offerings boosting sales. The resurgence of the virus in other regions across the world weighed on new export business, however, which fell for the third time in four months (albeit only slightly). The jump in petrol prices won’t alarm those who have made the switch to electric cars. Converting fossil fuel cars to electric is one option - and former football ace David Beckham has now taken in interest. He’s bought a 10% stake in Lunaz, a Silverstone-based company that electrifies classic cars from Rolls-Royce, Jaguar and Range Rover. Lunas is also planning to use the same technology on bin lorries, and other commercial vehicles. My colleague Jasper Jolly went to see them yesterday for a spin, and reports: Lunaz is part of a small but growing trend of the new battery economy: ripping out polluting engines and installing batteries and electric motors with zero exhaust emissions. The attraction for Beckham became clear during a Guardian test drive on Wednesday afternoon alongside the famous Silverstone race track in the well-upholstered back of a 1961 Rolls-Royce Phantom. Electric motors may lack the engine roar beloved of petrolheads, but the smooth, quiet ride they offer is well suited to the more rarefied atmosphere of chauffeur-driven luxury. At first glance the plush interior could have been hand-upholstered 50 years ago, but wooden charge and power dials tell a different story. New cars powered solely by petrol or diesel engines will be banned by 2030 in the UK, but the government is unlikely to order classic cars off the road, whatever their emissions, while London’s ultra-low emissions zone exempts historic vehicles. Yet there is still growing demand for upgrades in the car market. Workshops are springing up around the country that cater to this new class of customer as batteries finally reach the point where they can be slotted in to older models. The technology is there, but financially, it is likely to be some time before conversions of mass-market cars are within reach. Lunaz charges for classic models start at £245,000 for a Range Rover, putting it within the reach only of the very wealthy. For a historic Rolls-Royce those prices are £350,000 and upwards – very far upwards, judging by the range of bespoke options on offer. One or two new electric motors take up much less space than an engine, allowing Lunaz to squeeze in custom-made batteries and whatever newer technologies customers need, from air conditioning to electric windows, phone chargers and in-built TVs.... More here: Analysts predict that the oil price will continue to rise, as the relaxation of travel restrictions and other curbs are eased. Norbert Rucker, analyst at Swiss bank Julius Baer, explained: The strong demand dynamics and likely delays in the Iran nuclear deal negotiations pushed oil prices above the much-watched $70 per barrel level,” said “We expect oil prices to move well beyond $70 per barrel towards mid-year. Stephen Brennock of oil broker PVM also believes the market could absorb supply increases: “The market is optimistic that growing summer travel and reopening economies will easily accommodate additional OPEC+ production increases and even a possible Iranian return to the market.” CBA commodities analyst Vivek Dhar said in a note this week that demand from drivers was picking up too. “The U.S. driving season is a period that sees higher‑than‑normal fuel consumption. UK traffic is now sitting above pre‑pandemic levels. “We continue to see the oil demand recovery led by the U.S., Europe and China.” Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The oil price has hit a new two-year high, with demand increasing as economies emerge from lockdown, and producers keep supplies curbed. Brent crude has hit its highest level since May 2019 this morning, hitting $71.99 per barrel, having settled at a two-year high overnight. It’s now more than recovered from its slump early in the pandemic: US crude is catching up fast too - hitting $69.40 per barrel, its highest since October 2018. The rally comes after the Opec+ group agreed to maintain its slow easing of production cuts, and as negotiations continue over the Iranian nuclear deal - which could result in oil sanctions being lifted. Opec+ struck an optimistic tone about improving demand this week, which helped lift oil - even though it stuck to its policy of slowly relaxing production cuts. Saudi Arabia’s energy minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, predicted a demand recovery in China and the US in the coming months, with vaccine rollouts helping to rebalance the oil market. And overnight, US crude inventory figures showed a larger-than-expected drop in crude stocks - signaling rising demand, as the peak driving season looms in the US. With European economies reopening after their pandemic lockdowns (although new Covid-19 variants could yet derail these plans), fuel demand could strengthen. And that would potentially push inflation higher in the coming months too. Naeem Aslam, analyst at Avatrade, explains: Basically, traders are feeling a lot more optimistic about the reopening of the global economy and the continuation of the vaccination process. In addition to this, if we look at oil supply, it seems like major oil producers are very much maintaining their discipline. Traders also understand that the US and Iran’s nuclear deal cannot be reinstated that easily, and it will take a while before the previous conditions are enacted. This means no immediate increase in oil supply, and this is also supporting oil prices. Also coming up today The latest services sector PMI reports are expected to show strong growth in the UK, eurozone and the US....and probably intensifying price pressures as well. The latest US jobless claims data will be closely watched, ahead of tomorrow’s Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) jobs report for May - which may show a rebound in hiring after April’s slowdown. We also get the monthly assessment of US private sector payrolls, from ADP. Markets are looking calm, with investors cautious ahead of Friday’s NFP. But that doesn’t extend to the ‘meme stock’ world. Yesterday, a frenzy of trading in Reddit favourites saw cinema chain AMC Entertainment’s stock double to new record highs. AMC is expected to benefit as lockdown measures are rolled back, and people return to the cinema. It also launched a new platform for its sizable retail investor base - which includes a free large popcorn when attending a movie at AMC this summer. But even so, the rally is quite remarkable given the company’s pandemic struggles - sending the firm’s value soaring over $30bn (meaning more pain for the speculative hedge funds betting against it). As Bloomberg explains: The moonshot surge in the shares of AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. has vaulted it into the ranks of some of the world’s most valuable companies. The company has gone from a small cap to a large cap in the space of a few months. A 95% gain amid a retail-trading frenzy on Wednesday left the movie-theater chain with a market capitalization of $31.3bn. That makes it more valuable than half of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 Index. AMC is now worth more than Tyson Foods Inc. and Delta Air Lines Inc. despite projections for the company to bring in a fraction of their revenues.

The cookie cutter non-apology clearly not written by him - lifting a cut and paste ‘there is no place for this’ is just banal and insincere.

Given not out on the basis of there being two noises, it sounded on stump mic like Broad was pushing for it to go upstairs. Root agreed and was spot on to do so, hitting leg stump. 104th over: New Zealand 293-5 (Conway 166, de Grandhomme 0) Ohh, great bit of cricket to finish with Wood pushing another man back but going full to Conway, who leaves just outside his off-stump despite the from round the wicket angle. Back to back maidens from the fastest man on show - does Root keep him going? Meanwhile, on matters Conway, the real number I’m interested in is 287 - the highest score on debut: Tip Foster at Sydney in 1903. 103rd over: New Zealand 293-5 (Conway 166, de Grandhomme 0) Robinson to Conway, who takes a single to go past the mighty Charles Bannerman’s debut in the first Test Match in 1877. No respite for de Grandhomme, who has to make good decisions throughout. “On the subject of Robinson and his tweets, as an ethnic minority I am becoming tired of the meaningless apologies and the frankly insulting “I am not a racist” excuses,” writes Umran Sarwar. “It’s about the flippant mindset of treating people differently and as the other. The inside joke of the superior race and laughing at Jonny foreigner to make yourself feel better. The cookie cutter non-apology clearly not written by him - lifting a cut and paste ‘there is no place for this’ is just banal and insincere. He needs help yes but the pity should be extended to the ethnic minorities that he has insulted and not to him. He needs to get help, not be dragged kicking and screaming because he has been found out. Until he does so he is an embarrassment to the English shirt and it is not the ethnic minority players to educate him. He should be nowhere near the England team until he gets the help he obviously needs.” 102nd over: New Zealand 292-5 (Conway 165, de Grandhomme 0) Watching it back, Watling didn’t need to be clipping at that given it was on off-stump, but that’s an error created by Mark Wood’s wide angle on the crease and sharp pace. If you then shape it away, as he did then, it’s game on for the quick. de Grandhomme has to be right on his game to start, Wood testing him just outside the off stump. One brings two! Classy bowling from Wood, full with just enough shape off the seam, at serious pace. Watling wanted to flick it into the legside but it takes his outside edge instead, fizzing to Sibley at second slip. A very handy catch given he must’ve seen it late. 101st over: New Zealand 292-4 (Conway 165, Watling 1) Conway solid in defence and happy to leave Robinson alone when he’s outside the off stump. That’s just the second maiden of the day so far. This is where England could do with a turn from Jack Leach, but not to be. Sky cut to a young lad with his dad in the grandstand, wearing a t-shirt about his love of the game while scoring the innings. I was the kid with a scorebook at the MCG growing up - very happy times. 100th over: New Zealand 292-4 (Conway 165, Watling 1) Wood past the outside edge of Watling to finish after going beyond Conway’s inside edge earlier in the over. He’s well and truly in the game. “I played against North Devon CC sides containing the teenage Overtons some years ago and it would be fair to say they were vocal and let me know what they thought of me and my batting,” recalls Charles Sheldrick. “As a Somerset fan I am obviously disappointed that Overton is not in the side (and has not been released to play against Hants), but am I the only one who thinks that our boy may have dodged some attention by not being in the XI?” Given the scrutiny on Overton before the 2017-18 Ashes, I’d be surprised if there is anything on social media that hasn’t been reviewed by now. But yes, he’s another element to this story. 99th over: New Zealand 291-4 (Conway 164, Watling 1) Robinson attacking Watling’s stumps from the get go, well kept out. Drinks. New Zealand’s hour with Conway ticking along beautifully, but by ending that big partnership, the hosts have something to work with. 98th over: New Zealand 290-4 (Conway 163, Watling 1) That was a fantastic partnership, taking New Zealand from a bit of bother at 114-3, adding 174 for the fourth wicket. In walks BJ Watling, starting his final tour as an international cricketer, having announced his decision to retire after the World Test Championship final. He’s off the mark with one around the corner but a successful over for England - how they needed that and well bowled Mark Wood. “Morning Adam.” Hello, Simon Thomas. “I do love a trawl through scorecards of old, so thanks for putting that up. Apart from Ranji’s knock in the second innings, Tom Richardson sent down over 100 overs for his 13 wickets. Not bad in a 3 day game. I’ll not make a cheap comparison to yesterday’s over rate though, possibly because I think they were 4 ball overs, but still…” I’ve got some notes about that 1896 match stashed away somewhere form our Final Word live show at Manchester (Woodhouses CC; Athers’ club) a couple of years ago. I’ll dig them out at lunch. Wood gets Nicholls with the bouncer! He tried to take it on but it was too quick, the top edge landing with Robinson at long leg. 97th over: New Zealand 287-3 (Conway 161, Nicholls 61) Conway keeps scoring down the ground, with that uncomplicated and compact technique - four more. Robinson didn’t go a lot wrong but the opener is in the zone. If you’re wondering, when ignoring every caveat, he has the highest Test average of all time at the moment (or will, when dismissed). Yes, this means nothing, but makes a nice screenshot for his family seeing him ahead of Bradman et al. 96th over: New Zealand 282-3 (Conway 156, Nicholls 61) Wood bowled very quickly yesterday and without luck. He came ever so close to getting Conway with the short ball after tea, after hitting him twice with it before lunch. He’s up at Nicholls here though, who plays the extra pace nicely, clipping a couple along the way. “More than 90 overs with no catches and no sixes,” Jonathan McKinley observes. “Are the kiwis (like the bird) incapable of taking to the air?” Very good. And Devon Conway can go big, believe me. More on Conway: my man Hypocaust with the goods here. 95th over: New Zealand 280-3 (Conway 156, Nicholls 59) I’ve watched a lot of Robinson for Sussex and, putting everyone else aside and just speaking about him as a bowler, I’m not surprised at all that he looks completely at home at Test level. He’s been ready for this step up for a couple of seasons. Very good to Conway here. 94th over: New Zealand 279-3 (Conway 156, Nicholls 58) “Book yourself in,” says David Lloyd of the New Zealand pair, getting a chance to bat big after getting through this first half an hour. A single to Nicholls behind square and a couple for Conway in the same direction. Athers says that Conway’s 156 is now the highest score for any man on debut in England. Wow! He goes past Ranji’s 154 - a brilliant Test at Manchester in 1896. I’ve argued in the past that Old Trafford is the greatest Ashes venue and this match helps with that. “Good morning.” And to you, John Starbuck. “One thing I did enjoy yesterday was hearing, on the Beeb’s highlights show, an Antipodean commentator saying the magic words ‘Day Boo’ again. It’s the little things one misses.” That’d be Craig McMillan, working on BBC TV. It continues to be the word that prompts the most scrutiny when commentating in England: I’m hardwired to day-boo, nothing I can do about it. 93rd over: New Zealand 276-3 (Conway 154, Nicholls 57) Ollie Robinson into the attack, to a chorus of support from his colleagues. How will he handle this pressure? Has he been able to switch it off? He gives Nicholls one on his pads early in the over, helped down the slope for three. Better to Conway, locating his inside edge. “Well,” says Mark Slater, “there we were wondering how the ECB was going to accommodate a surfiet of fast bowling talent into the national side. Seems that a check into the media history of prospects, and their unilateral acknowledgement and regrets for any stupidity found, could be a criteria for inclusion going forward.” 92nd over: New Zealand 273-3 (Conway 154, Nicholls 54) This is turning into a huge debut effort from Conway, raising his bat for 150. He’s already the highest scorer at Lord’s when appearing for the first time and now has the chance to join the small club of international players to make that a double. Nicholls’ turn, on the front foot scoring again, grabbing three past point. And now four more for Conway, steering to deep third as he has so well - despite going through fourth slip, he’s played that with control. It prompts a chat between Broad and Root, third slip coming out. To Plan B. 91st over: New Zealand 265-3 (Conway 149, Nicholls 51) The second over in a row where Anderson has started with a half-volley, put away this time through point by Conway. “Excellent,” says Nasser, “waiting for hit to pass him then flat-batting it for four.” Jimmy is again back where he needs to be soon enough, locating the opener’s inside edge. The Black Caps have added 19 runs in 20 minutes. 90th over: New Zealand 258-3 (Conway 143, Nicholls 50) A lovely way for Nicholls to bring up his half-century, on-driving Broad into the rope beneath the pavilion. He’s been such a big part of New Zealand’s rise over the last three years - a very good cricketer, averaging 45 in Tests, ranked sixth in the world by the ICC. 89th over: New Zealand 254-3 (Conway 143, Nicholls 46) Half-volley, put away by Conway to the grandstand side of the ground. Shot. Sure enough, Anderson is back on his length straight away, up again for leg before, but much as it was in his previous over, going just over the top. Good cricket. “That’s the length at Lord’s,” says Nasser. 88th over: New Zealand 250-3 (Conway 139, Nicholls 46) The 250 is up with a delightful straight drive, a shot Conway played so well yesterday either side of his century milestone. They take three. Beforehand, Bracey mishandled a ball that swung late, spitting away for a bye. The wicketkeeper is in the game again later in the over with Broad’s scramble-seamer doing plenty after Nicholls shoulders arms. Lord’s, as they say, is never an easy place for stumpers. And here, my friends, is the overseas TMS link! Enjoy! 87th over: New Zealand 246-3 (Conway 136, Nicholls 46) Ouch, Jimmy, running in from the Nursery End, gets one to take off from a good length first ball of the day, Conway ripping his bottom hand off the blade at the point of contact. A reminder that this second new ball is only six overs old, so this is an important passage. Good leave later in the over, bouncing over off-stump. Now a shout for leg before with one going beyond the left-hander’s inside edge, but it’s pitched outside leg; no review. All told, a predictably probing start. The players are on the field. James Anderson, the floor is yours. Conway to face for New Zealand. PLAY! “Hi, Adam.” Morning, Andrew Moore. “As someone with virtually no social media profile am curious as to why this is coming out now? Has it been deliberately timed to damage Ollie Robinson (which in itself would be a pretty vile thing to do), or is it the result of people on Twitter searching his history due to his increased exposure.” Good question. A bit of both, I reckon. Not that this is the answer (as Nasser said perfectly on TV last night) but it’s remarkable to me that Robinson’s support team didn’t have the presence of mind to clean this up before he was in the spotlight. It’s widely acknowledged by the man himself that he had a few anger issues. Did nobody twig that there might be some dreadful tweets out there? Odd. Nice stuff. Reminds me of the story of Mark Waugh in 1993. So certain they were that he was marching towards 100, a teammate already popped up the sticky tape on the Lord’s board. Sure enough, out for 99; one of two men to fall one short of a ton in that Test. But it worked out for Waugh in the end, his name up there eight years later after completing his 19th Test century - a gorgeous knock. There’ll be a lot of emails about Robinson. I’ll try my best to read them all and will include some, but plese don’t be cross with me if your note doesn’t appear. Here’s one to open the batting. “Hiya, Collo.” Morning, Iain McKane. “Seems Robinson’s sanction may be at least that handed down to Craig Overton for his offensive remarks a few years back. Robinson’s age/immaturity at the time (and, if it can be proved, his state of mind then, during an apparently tempestuous time in his life) should be taken into account in mitigation of sanction; but, this is a serious matter, whatever your age. A ban for at least the next Test would seem appropriate and reasonable, if within the ECB’s powers. I would also recommend OR undertakes some professionally-mediated meetings with members of the England set-up from minority backgrounds, as well as further education programmes.” It’s a lovely morning in London. 20 degrees now; expected to reach 24 this afternoon. On account of the fact they maintained such a poor over rate yesterday - always a risk when not playing a spinner - the hosts only got six overs in with the second new ball before stumps. So, an opening for Anderson and Broad before Conway (136) and Nicholls (48) get themselves in again. The incumbent pair added 102 chanceless runs through the course of the final session. Mark Wood is talking to TMS. “I saw him at breakfast. Obviously, last night was pretty tough for him and the whole team to get that news but I think he is going to just try and concentrate on the cricket today and get his mind firmly fixed on what is an important morning for us to try and get back into the game. So, mentally if his head is in that space, I think he can do the business as he did yesterday.” Sky are on air. There will be a lot of attention on what the commentators have to say in response to Robinson’s statement. “I was pretty depressed when I left the ground last night,” Mike Atherton begins. “It should have been the greatest day of his cricketing life but he ends up giving a humiliating apology. I thought it was a distressing story on so many levels.” He believes Robinson will be disciplined by the ECB after the match, especially after the t-shirts the England team wore before play yesterday re-affirming the organisation’s anti-discrimination stance. “These things certainly have an impact upon an individual,” Atherton continues on Robinson’s mindset coming into today. “He will feel that everyone is watching him, all the cameras are watching him, and you need to be very mentally strong to get through that.” Simon Doull didn’t like the statement, which he says was clearly written by the ECB rather than the man himself, saying he would rather have heard something from the heart. As for what comes next, he wants him to be educated and helped through this. How does the meme go when adapted for our sport? One regular day of England cricket / That’s all I ask / Will never happen. And so it was yesterday at Lord’s. Sure, it was conventional enough on the scoreboard, New Zealand ticking along very nicely to reach 246-3 with Devon Conway marching to a quite outstanding unbeaten 136 on debut. However, anyone playing along via twitter through the afternoon session knew that the main action was to come at stumps via another man making his bow, Ollie Robinson. In case you missed it - unlikely as that is - as England’s new quick bowled a potent spell after lunch, old tweets of his were being mined and the result was grim. Really grim. Just about every box was ticked: sexism, racism, the works. Simon Burnton recaps what we know (and more tweets have surfaced since this was written), along with Robinson’s subsequent apology issued after play. That piece also includes strongly-worded comments from Tom Harrison, the ECB’s chief executive, with the organisation set to carry out a review at the end of this Test Match. He didn’t miss: I do not have the words to express how disappointed I am that an England men’s player has chosen to write tweets of this nature, however long ago that might have been. Any person reading those words, particularly a woman or person of colour, would take away an image of cricket and cricketers that is completely unacceptable. We are better than this. We have a zero-tolerance stance to any form of discrimination and there are rules in place that handle conduct of this nature.

A year after the coronavirus pandemic emptied airports, air travel associations fear chaos during Europe’s summer holiday season as travellers could wait hours before boarding planes due to health checks.</p> <p>Strict controls are still in place at most European airports even though vaccination campaigns are making progress and infection rates are falling.</p> <p>The International Air Transport Association (IATA) reported last week that on average, people travelling at peak times now stay twice as long at airports - three hours - compared with 2019.</p> <p>That time is generally spent checking in, passing security and immigration controls, picking up checked bags and making it through customs. And there’s the new reality: Airlines having to check passengers’ Covid tests, temperature and other health documents.</p> <p>The wait time has increased even though the volume of traffic is “only about 30 percent of pre-Covid-19 levels”, an IATA statement said.</p> <p>The sector lobby group warned that time spent in airports could swell to five hours and 30 minutes if traffic rebounds to 75 percent of its pre-pandemic level, and even longer “without process improvements”.</p> <p>The EU Digital Covid Certificate - showing whether a traveller was vaccinated, has immunity from a previous infection or passed a coronavirus test - will be rolled out on 1 July in an effort to make travel smoother within the 27-nation bloc.</p> <p>“The level of both uncertainty and complexity in planning for the restart is just mind blowing for now,” said the director general of the European branch of Airports Control International, Olivier Jankovec. His association represents 500 airports on the continent.</p> <p>“With each passing day, the prospect of travellers enduring widespread chaos at airports this summer is becoming more real.”</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-06-03T07:37:36.006Z\">at 8.37am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-60b881cf8f082e80569f4b23\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-03T07:17:07.855Z\">8.17am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Indonesia</strong> has cancelled the haj pilgrimage for people in the world’s largest Muslim-majority nation for a second year in a row due to concerns over the pandemic, the religious affairs minister said this morning.<br></p> <p>Reuters report that minister Yaqut Cholil Qoumas told a briefing that Saudi Arabia, where the pilgrimage takes place, had not opened access to the haj.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60b87f088f08b9889b367642\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-03T07:07:55.130Z\">8.07am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">UK government 'shortchanging children' in England on catch-up plans – Labour spokesperson</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In the UK, Labour’s opposition spokesperson <strong>James Murray</strong> has also been trailing round the TV and radio studios.

In some areas local political leaders have retreated from public engagement on the issue, while in others, including Tuskegee, local leadership has played a vital role in pushing rates above the state average.</p> <p>Omar Neal, a local radio host and community leader, took his shot almost as soon as it was available. He weighed the heavy history but set aside what he described as instinctive distrust of public health systems after generations of failures.</p> <p>“Trust is a calculated risk,” he said, pausing for a moment. “Five hundred and eighty-eight thousand people have died because they didn’t get this vaccine.

More than 35 million doses have been administered, with 12.4 million people - almost 23% of the population - now fully vaccinated, according to health ministry figures. Hailing the widening of the vaccination programme, health minister Robert Speranza said: “We can still accelerate our campaign to get through this difficult season.” However, health experts have warned that immunising children against Covid should only be considered in special circumstances due to the potential of it raising important practical and ethical problems. “Children transmit Covid to some extent, although they rarely suffer badly from the disease themselves. If you offer them vaccines, then you put them at risk of possible side-effects – so there really needs to be some significant, tangible benefit to them, not just the indirect protection of adults from Covid-19,” said Prof Adam Finn of Bristol University last week. More than two billion Covid-19 vaccines have been given across the world, according to an AFP tally drawn from official sources. The milestone comes six months after the first vaccination campaigns against Covid-19 began. At least 2,109,696,022 shots have been given in 215 countries and territories, according to the count from an AFP database. Israel remains the country with the most vaccinated, with nearly six-in-10 people in the country fully inoculated against Covid. It is followed by Canada (59% of the population have had at least one jab), the UK (58.3%), Chile (56.6%) and the US (51%). Six out of 10 of the injections have been administered in the world’s three most populous countries – China (704.8 million doses), the US (296.9 million) and India (221 million). Nearly four-in-10 people in the EU have had at least one shot, with Germany leading with 43.6%, followed by Italy (40%) and France and Spain on 39.4%. Only six countries in the world have not yet started vaccinating - North Korea, Haiti, Tanzania, Chad, Burundi and Eritrea. But with vaccination programmes now accelerating, China leads the league of countries giving doses the fastest over the last week, injecting 1.37% of its population per day. Bahrain and Uruguay are also covering about 1% a day. Greece is to supply its northern neighbours Albania and North Macedonia with 40,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccines, the country’s spokeswoman has said. “Greece, in coordination with the European Commission, as most European countries do for their neighbours, will offer vaccines ... 20,000 doses to North Macedonia and 20,000 to Albania,” Aristotelia Peloni told a news conference. Covid is many times more prevalent in Indonesia than shown by official figures in the world’s fourth most populous country, authors of two new studies told Reuters. The news agency reports the country of 270 million has recorded 1.83 million positive cases, but epidemiologists have long believed the true scale of the spread has been obscured by a lack of testing and contact tracing. One nationwide study between December and January suggested 15% of Indonesians had already contracted the virus - when official figures at the end of January had recorded infections among only around 0.4% of people. Even now, Indonesia’s total positive infections are only around 0.7% of the population. The results of the survey were not unexpected given under reporting, said Pandu Riono, a University of Indonesia epidemiologist who worked on the study carried out with help from the World Health Organisation. Siti Nadia Tarmizi, a senior health ministry official, said it was possible the study was preliminary, but there might be more cases than officially reported because many cases were asymptomatic. She said Indonesia had a lack of contact tracing and not enough laboratories to process tests. Once touted by former US president Donald Trump, and subsequently derided by some as lacking efficacy evidence, the potential Covid treatment based on a cocktail of monoclonal antibodies developed by US drugmaker Regeneron and Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche has been purchased by the EU to the tune of about 55,000 doses. Reuters reports that the deal is the bloc’s first contract for this kind of drug, as it aims to identify 10 promising treatments by the end of the month amid a failure by pharmaceutical companies to swiftly deliver sufficient supplies of vaccines after initial promise. The deal with Roche was reached in April, the company told Reuters, but contract details were not made public. A European Commission spokesman said the EU had secured about 55,000 doses of the single-dose treatment. The only other anti-Covid drug the EU has bought is Gilead’s remdesivir, an antiviral medicine. Last year, the EU reserved half a million courses after the drug obtained a conditional EU approval. European countries would buy the Roche-Regeneron drug, which is composed of the monoclonal antibodies casirivimab and imdevimab, only after it was approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) or by national drug regulators. “The EU authorisation is expected between August and October 2021,” an EU document says, citing Roche estimates.

Hong Kong will open its vaccine scheme to children over the age of 12, as it pursues a broader campaign across the city to incentivise its 7.5 million residents to get vaccinated. The region started its vaccination programme in February but only around 14% of the population have been fully vaccinated so far. Another 17 people have died in Taiwan, where authorities reported 364 new local cases and 219 backlogged cases added to previous days’ totals. It brings Taiwan’s total death toll to 166, of which 154 have been since 15 May. Bulgaria plans to provide about 150,000 Covid vaccines to its Balkan neighbours, health minister Stoicho Katsarov has said. It has the lowest inoculation rates in the European Union, but Katsarov said the country has agreed to receive about 13m doses under the EU supply scheme by the end of the year and can afford to help other countries. “The idea is to distribute up to 150,000 doses among our neighbouring western Balkan countries,” Katsarov said, adding that Sofia has received requests from North Macedonia, Albania, Kosovo and Bosnia. A coronavirus variant which Vietnam authorities thought was a combination of the Indian and UK strains is not a new hybrid, but part of the existing Indian strain, the World Health Organization’s representative in Vietnam has said. The WHO in Nepal has also denied reports that there is a “Nepal variant” causing concern. Syria has received its first shipment of Russian Sputnik V vaccine. Syrian President Bashar Assad was inoculated with the vaccine, the Syrian ambassador to Moscow said. The Serum Institute of India has sought regulatory approval to make Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine, on top of the AstraZeneca and Novavax shots it is already producing. Indonesia has cancelled the haj pilgrimage for people in the world’s largest Muslim-majority nation for a second year in a row due to concerns over the pandemic. Infection rates in Germany continue to drop as the country slowly emerges from eight months of lockdown, but politicians are urging caution over a possible variant-driven resurgence at the end of the summer. Seiko Hashimoto, the president of the Tokyo 2020 organising committee has ruled out a cancellation or further postponement of the Olympics, amid concerns about hosting the event during a global pandemic. “We cannot postpone again,” she said in an interview And you might be interested in the latest episode of the Guardian’s Today In Focus podcast, exploring the Wuhan lab leak theory… Reuters have very handily – for me, if not for you – wrapped up exactly which countries in Europe are now allowing children and adolescents to be vaccinated. France will start vaccinating teenagers from age 12 on 15 June Germany plans to offer a first shot to children aged 12-16 from 7 June, while Poland would offer shots to those aged 12-15 the same day. Lithuania’s prime minister said the country could start vaccinating children from age 12 in June. Italy on 31 May approved extending the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to 12-15 year olds. Austria aims to have over 340,000 children aged 12-15 vaccinated by the end of August. Hungary started vaccinating 16-18-year-olds in mid-May. Switzerland’s health watchdog said in early May Pfizer had sought approval for its shot in children aged 12-15. San Marino on 1 June opened vaccinations for children aged 12-15. Infection rates in Germany continue to drop as the country slowly emerges from eight months of lockdown, but politicians are urging caution over a possible variant-driven resurgence at the end of the summer. The seven-day incidence of infections per 100,000 people over seven days dropped to 34.1 on Thursday, with 4,640 new infections reported by Germany’s disease control agency, the Robert Koch Institute. Social Democrat delegate Karl Lauterbach, a trained doctor and prominent health expert, said he expected the incidence rate to remain around 35 in the coming weeks, as people spent more time outdoors during the summer and more and more people were fully immunised. Some 53 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines have been administered in Germany so far, and 44.6% of the population has had at least one shot. Lauterbach said he expected the “Delta variant” of the virus that was first detected in India to become more dominant in Germany after the holidays, saying it “will probably spread around numerous European countries in the coming months”. For now, the Delta variant B1.617.2 only plays a minor role in Germany, making up 2.1 percent of cases reported over the last week. Nonetheless Germany is one of the European countries who have imposed restrictions on travel from the United Kingdom over the variant, with anyone entering Germany from the UK will be required quarantine for two weeks on arrival, even if they test negative for the coronavirus. Regular readers of this blog will know that I usually slightly raise one eyebrow when reporting the official numbers out of Russia as they are remarkably consistent. They’ve pretty much been in the range of 7,000 to 9,500 daily every day since early March, which feels unusual as it suggest the virus is neither gathering pace or diminishing, which tends not to be how epidemics behave. Today is no different, as Russia reported 8,933 new cases taking the official national tally since the pandemic began to 5,099,182. The government coronavirus task force said 393 people had died of coronavirus linked causes in the past 24 hours, pushing the national death toll to 122,660. Reuters always note that the federal statistics agency has kept a separate count and has said Russia recorded significantly more fatalities than that. They put the figure at around 250,000 deaths related to Covid from April 2020 to March 2021. My colleague Nicola Slawson has just opened up the UK live blog for the day – so if you are looking for UK Covid news, that’s where you need to head. I’ll be continuing here with global updates. Bulgaria plans to provide about 150,000 Covid vaccines to its Balkan neighbours, health minister Stoicho Katsarov has said. Bulgaria has the lowest inoculation rates in the European Union, but Katsarov said the country has agreed to receive about 13m doses under the EU supply scheme by the end of the year and can afford to help other countries. “The idea is to distribute up to 150,000 doses among our neighbouring western Balkan countries,” Katsarov told reporters, adding that Sofia has received requests from North Macedonia, Albania, Kosovo and Bosnia. “Our needs are fully covered so there is no danger whatsoever that Bulgaria can be left without vaccines,” he said. Reuters report Katsarov said he expects to receive an answer on Friday from the European Commission how exactly the country should proceed and whether it could donate or sell the doses. He said Bulgaria was looking to donate mostly AstraZeneca vaccines, not least because of the low interest in them at home. Last week president Rumen Radev said Sofia plans to donate a significant amount of vaccines to North Macedonia in a move that could help improve strained relations over Bulgaria’s veto on the start of EU accession talks with Skopje. A quick one from Sky here, that the reopening of indoor hospitality last month failed to boost footfall in town centres in England. The figures are compiled by a company called Springboard, and they said: May was the wettest on record which inevitably lowered the initial exhilaration of consumers in being able to eat out as even visiting indoor environments necessitated braving the weather. Secondly, the limitations on dining capacity in indoor venues inevitably means that the uplift in footfall generated has been limited; and thirdly most of the increase in footfall has occurred post 5pm when volumes of activity are far lower those than during retail trading hours. Footfall in May 2021 was around 25% down on the same pre-pandemic period in 2019 Hong Kong will open its vaccine scheme to children over the age of 12 for the first time, Reuters report, as it pursues a broader campaign across the city to incentivise its 7.5 million residents to get vaccinated. The region started its vaccination programme in February but only around 14% of the population have been fully vaccinated so far. Another 17 people have died in Taiwan, where authorities reported 364 new local cases and 219 backlogged cases added to previous days’ totals. It brings Taiwan’s total death toll to 166, of which 154 have been since 15 May. Taiwan’s worst outbreak since the pandemic began continues to report high daily numbers, but analyses of the general trend are tentatively suggesting a decline. Finding trends in the data has been made difficult during this outbreak, as a backlog of cases routinely adds dozens of cases to previous days. In its daily briefing today, the central epidemic command centre reported details of a growing outbreak in aged care, and a cluster among migrant workers in Miaoli county. Ahead of an upcoming long weekend, health and welfare minister Chen Chih-Shung urged people not to travel. Taiwan is on level 3 of a four tier alert system which does not stop people from traveling. Restrictions limit gatherings to 10 outside and five inside, restaurants are take-away only, and employers have been urged to facilitate working from home, although this has not been widely taken up. Another quick Reuters snap here, that Syria has received the first shipment of Russian Sputnik V vaccine. Syrian President Bashar Assad was inoculated with the vaccine, Syrian ambassador to Russia Riad Haddad said. Also on variants, Reuters report that a coronavirus variant which Vietnam authorities thought was a combination of the Indian and UK strains is not a new hybrid but part of the existing Indian strain, the World Health Organization’s representative in Vietnam told Nikkei. “There is no new hybrid variant in Vietnam at this moment based on WHO definition,” Kidong Park said in an online interview with the newspaper, adding that it was within the “Delta variation” that was first detected in India. In the UK today the Daily Mail is carrying a front page story warning of the threat from what they call a “Nepal variant”. The World Health Organization in Nepal have put out a tweet this morning saying that they aren’t aware of any such variant. One of things we are expecting today is for the UK government to announce if they are making any changes to the green, amber and red lists for international travel. A lot of people with hopes of a holiday or visiting loved ones abroad will have their eye closely on the situation – we might get that news around 11am this morning. Getting there may prove more of a headache than usual, as AFP report. A year after the coronavirus pandemic emptied airports, air travel associations fear chaos during Europe’s summer holiday season as travellers could wait hours before boarding planes due to health checks. Strict controls are still in place at most European airports even though vaccination campaigns are making progress and infection rates are falling. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) reported last week that on average, people travelling at peak times now stay twice as long at airports - three hours - compared with 2019. That time is generally spent checking in, passing security and immigration controls, picking up checked bags and making it through customs. And there’s the new reality: Airlines having to check passengers’ Covid tests, temperature and other health documents. The wait time has increased even though the volume of traffic is “only about 30 percent of pre-Covid-19 levels”, an IATA statement said. The sector lobby group warned that time spent in airports could swell to five hours and 30 minutes if traffic rebounds to 75 percent of its pre-pandemic level, and even longer “without process improvements”. The EU Digital Covid Certificate - showing whether a traveller was vaccinated, has immunity from a previous infection or passed a coronavirus test - will be rolled out on 1 July in an effort to make travel smoother within the 27-nation bloc. “The level of both uncertainty and complexity in planning for the restart is just mind blowing for now,” said the director general of the European branch of Airports Control International, Olivier Jankovec. His association represents 500 airports on the continent. “With each passing day, the prospect of travellers enduring widespread chaos at airports this summer is becoming more real.” Indonesia has cancelled the haj pilgrimage for people in the world’s largest Muslim-majority nation for a second year in a row due to concerns over the pandemic, the religious affairs minister said this morning. Reuters report that minister Yaqut Cholil Qoumas told a briefing that Saudi Arabia, where the pilgrimage takes place, had not opened access to the haj. In the UK, Labour’s opposition spokesperson James Murray has also been trailing round the TV and radio studios. On the proposals for catch-up funding for pupils in England, he told Sky News: I think everyone listening to the show will realise that what the government is doing by shortchanging children feels wrong, and it’s also the ultimate false economy. If we don’t invest in protecting our children now, and making sure that their education catches up, that they are prepared in terms of their mental wellbeing and so on, it’s going to cost the country and the economy dearly in the long run. Seth Borenstein, science writer at AP, reports that in the US, new White House science adviser Eric Lander wants to have a vaccine ready to fight the next pandemic in just about 100 days after recognizing a potential viral outbreak. In his first interview after being sworn in, he painted a rosy near future where a renewed American emphasis on science not only better prepares the world for the next pandemic with plug-and-play vaccines, but also changes how medicine fights disease and treats patients, curbs climate change and further explores space. “This is a moment in so many ways, not just health, that we can rethink fundamental assumptions about what’s possible and that’s true of climate and energy and many areas,” Lander told The Associated Press. “It was amazing at one level that we were able to produce highly effective vaccines in less than a year, but from another point of view you’d say, ‘Boy, a year’s a long time,”’ even though in the past it would take three years or four years, Lander said. “To really make a difference we want to get this done in 100 days. And so a lot of us have been talking about a 100-day target from the recognition from a virus with pandemic potential.” “It would mean that we would have had a vaccine in early April if that had happened this time, early April of 2020,” Lander said. “It makes you gulp for a second, but it’s totally feasible to do that.” He is the first director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy to be promoted to Cabinet level in a US administration. Lander said President Joe Biden’s elevation of the science post is a symbolic show “that science should have a seat at the table” but also allows him to have higher-level talks with different agency chiefs about making policy. A very quick Reuters snap here that the Serum Institute of India has sought regulatory approval to make Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine, on top of the AstraZeneca and Novavax shots it is already producing. In England, much of the news this morning has been dominated by the continued fall-out over the government’s plans for education “catch-up” spending. Yesterday Sir Kevan Collins quit, said to be dismayed that his long-awaited £15bn proposals were watered down to a £1.4bn package. Home Office minister Victoria Atkins has been out and about fronting up the government response, saying that the Government’s education recovery fund was “very much focused on what we can deliver and deliver quickly” Collins said in his resignation statement that the package of support is “too narrow, too small and will be delivered too slowly”. When asked on Sky News, Atkins said she had not read the resignation statement – which does seem somewhat extraordinary given that she’s been sent out this morning specifically to rebut it She told Sky News the Government was “continuing to look at things like lengthening the school day”. Meanwhile, PA report that senior Conservative MP Robert Halfon said the Government must “decide their priorities in terms of education” and that the Treasury can “find the money from the back of the sofa”, where there is the political will. The chairman of the Education Select Committee told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “Of course there are funding constraints but the Treasury announced over £16bn extra for defence only last year, we’ve got £800m being spent on a new research agency, £200m being spent on a yacht. “So where there is the political will, the Treasury can find the money from the back of the sofa, and there has to be that political will because we need a long-term plan for education, a proper funding settlement.” He said the damage caused by Covid-19 to younger children “has been nothing short of disastrous”. Oliver Laughland brings us a special report on vaccine hesitancy this morning from Tuskegee and Florala in the US: In 1997, President Bill Clinton apologized for the Tuskegee study, which he described as “clearly racist”. Two decades on, the legacy of what happened here has been routinely cited as a reason many Black Americans remain distrustful of the country’s medical systems and also the Covid-19 vaccine itself. It is then, perhaps, against expectation that vaccination rates in Macon county, where this city of 8,000 residents is situated, are substantially higher than the state average in Alabama. In Macon county, 36% of residents have now received their first shot compared with only 32% statewide. In this historic region of Black Belt counties, home to large populations of Black residents, some jurisdictions have completed vaccinations at rates of over 40%. But Alabama and the neighbouring state of Mississippi have for months had the lowest vaccination rates in the country, with vaccine hesitancy underwritten by different forces in various locations across the state. In some areas local political leaders have retreated from public engagement on the issue, while in others, including Tuskegee, local leadership has played a vital role in pushing rates above the state average. Omar Neal, a local radio host and community leader, took his shot almost as soon as it was available. He weighed the heavy history but set aside what he described as instinctive distrust of public health systems after generations of failures. “Trust is a calculated risk,” he said, pausing for a moment. “Five hundred and eighty-eight thousand people have died because they didn’t get this vaccine. Nobody died that did take it. That’s pretty good odds for me.” Read more of Oliver Laughland’s report here: Alabama faces vaccine hesitancy but only some counties try to tackle it A five-pronged approach focused on the five C’s - confidence, complacency, convenience, communication and context - is needed to combat vaccine hesitancy, according to scientists from the UK, US and South Africa. PA report that writing in the Royal Society of Medicine journal, they say complacency due to lower perceptions of personal risk and disease severity, particularly among younger people and those of lower socioeconomic status, is strongly associated with lower vaccine uptake. One of the authors, Dr Mohammad Razai, of the Population Health Research Institute at St George’s, University of London, said: “As the lower age groups are being offered the vaccine, addressing complacency through repeated risk communication is crucial to facilitate informed decision-making. “It is important to emphasise the greater societal benefits of population level immunity and the protection it offers to those vulnerable, their families and friends.” The proposed strategy also focuses on convenience of vaccination delivery, communication to combat misinformation, and recognition of context including ethnicity, religion, occupation and socioeconomic status. Confidence in vaccine safety, efficacy and importance is crucial, and the public needs to be aware that for most people the benefits of vaccine “vastly outweigh the risk” of rare side effects, they write. Getting Alan Sugar to endorse the vaccine for young people was probably not on their list of priorities, but he’s done that on social media this morning in his own imitable style. Workers in Melbourne in Australia who haven’t had shifts due to the extended Covid lockdown will be eligible for up to $500 in support after the prime minister announced a new temporary Covid disaster payment. Scott Morrison said on Thursday the disaster payment would be available in areas declared a commonwealth hotspot when any lockdown lasted longer than seven days. A $500 weekly payment will be available for people who work more than 20 hours a week while $325 will be available for those who work less than that. The support will only go to people older than 17, who were working before the lockdown and who can no longer work. They will need to have less than $10,000 in savings. There are further restrictions including whether other leave – beyond annual and sick leave – is available to cover the lockdown period. Good morning, it is Martin Belam here in London taking over for the next few hours. I must say that I was one of those very sceptical about the Wuhan lab leak theory initially, as much of the evidence posted online that I saw seemed to amount to not much more than “They have a lab there, you know”. Former MI6 chief Sir Richard Dearlove possibly knows his onions a bit better than me, and he’s had some pretty stringent words about the origins of the virus on a podcast from the Telegraph, and PA have picked up the quotes this morning. He says: The People’s Republic of China is a pretty terrifying regime and does some things we consider unacceptable and extreme in silencing opposition to the official line of the government. We don’t know that’s what’s happened, but a lot of data have probably been destroyed or made to disappear so it’s going to be difficult to prove definitely the case for a ‘gain of function chimera’ being the cause of the pandemic. Trevor Marshallsea writes that Sir Richard said he felt some vindication as more people were beginning to take seriously his repeated questioning of the origins of the coronavirus. He spoke of “extraordinary behaviour” in the scientific community which had “shut down any debate” and which he said verged on “academic bullying”. China, he said, had originally been “let off the hook” on questions about the virus’s origins due to scepticism over the Trump administration, which had led such enquiries initially. He also said the West had been naive in trusting China, which had infiltrated scientific institutions and journals in the UK and elsewhere. The latest episode of the Guardian’s Today In Focus podcast is exploring the Wuhan lab leak theory. When Covid-19 first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan, much of the focus of the initial investigation fell on a seafood market that also sold exotic animals for human consumption. But in the months since, no definitive link has been proven and the precise origin story remains unsolved. In the intervening period numerous conspiracy theories have spread: that somehow 5G phone signals could be involved, or that the virus is a hoax. Bracketed in with these was a theory that Covid-19 may have been released (accidentally or otherwise) from a lab. Initially scientists poured scorn on the lab leak theory but in recent months suspicion has fallen on the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which studies coronaviruses. As the Guardian’s Peter Beaumont tells Anushka Asthana, these suspicions are still being treated with scepticism by scientists. But now, in the absence of any other confirmed origin, Joe Biden has asked US intelligence agencies to consider the lab leak theory as a possibility and to investigate. So how seriously should we take it? In Australia, Melbourne GPs say they are being forced to turn away huge numbers of vaccine-seeking locals, including busloads of vulnerable residents from care facilities, because the commonwealth’s supply of doses has not increased to match the explosion in demand. The latest outbreak has caused a huge increase in demand for the Covid-19 vaccine in Victoria, and the state is now recording daily vaccination numbers of above 20,000 in primary care, up from the roughly 2,300 doses administered on 24 May. The demand has inundated local GPs, who say their supplies of vaccine doses are evaporating almost immediately. Seiko Hashimoto, the president of the Tokyo 2020 organising committee has ruled out a cancellation or further postponement of the Olympics, amid concerns about hosting the event during a global pandemic. “We cannot postpone again,” she said in an interview with Nikkan Sports newspaper. Reuters reports: Public opinion polls in Japan have consistently shown that a majority want the Games cancelled or put off yet again after being delayed by one year because of the coronavirus crisis. A majority of the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly feel the same way, the Tokyo Shimbun newspaper reported on Thursday. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga is likely to call a snap election after the Olympic and Paralympic Games, the Asahi newspaper reported, showing his resolve to push ahead with the event. Towns and cities lined up to host Olympic training or events have increasingly expressed resistance, amid concern visitors will spread variant strains of the virus and drain medical resources. The government of Ota City has been inundated with complaints by residents over a decision to give preferential Covid-19 vaccinations to city and hotel staff tending to Australian athletes, media reported. While Japan has avoided the large-scale infections suffered by many other nations, severe cases are rising in the latest outbreak. More than 746,000 cases have been recorded and more than 13,000 deaths. Shigeru Omi, Japan’s top medical adviser, told a parliamentary committee on Wednesday that it was “not normal” to host the Olympics amid the current state of infections. Reuters: Pot-banging protests erupted across several cities in Brazil last night, as President Jair Bolsonaro addressed the nation, Reuters reports. It occurred just days after protestors took to the streets across the country over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which has so far killed almost half a million people. The last few days have been rocky for the government of the right-wing leader, whose popularity had already been flagging amid persistently high daily Covid-19 deaths and cases. On Wednesday alone, almost 100,000 Brazilians came down with the coronavirus and 2,507 died, according to government data. Earlier in the day, the nation’s Supreme Court authorised a criminal investigation into Bolsonaro’s environment minister for allegedly interfering with a police probe into illegal logging. In the televised speech, Bolsonaro briefly summarised some of his government’s recent accomplishments and pledged strong economic growth going forward, but presented no new information. On Saturday, thousands participated in protests in at least 16 cities across the country, which were organised by leftist political parties, unions and student associations. In Sao Paulo, Brazil’s largest city, thousands of mask-wearing people blocked one the largest city’s avenues, while a large balloon depicted Bolsonaro as a vampire. Some protests, like the one in Rio de Janeiro, included images of former leftist president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who has emerged as Bolsonaro’s main challenger in the nation’s 2022 election, wearing the presidential sash. In the brief Wednesday evening speech, Bolsonaro, who has ridiculed masks and vaccines in the past, said all Brazilians who wanted a vaccine would be able to get one by the end of the year. Also in the evening, the nation’s Health Ministry revised down the number of Covid-19 vaccines it will receive in June by about 4 million doses. Hello and welcome to our continuing coverage of the global pandemic. Here is a short update of developments in the last 24 hours In the US Joe Biden has announced a “national month of action” to get 70% of Americans vaccinated. Meanwhile in Australia, doctors in Melbourne say they have had to turn away patients because they don’t have enough vaccines to meet demand. The pandemic has pushed more than 100 million more workers into poverty, the UN has said. Cancellation or another postponement of the Tokyo Olympic Games has been ruled out by the head of the organising committee. France will start vaccinating teenagers from age 12 with the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine on June 15, the government said. Mexico reported 3,269 new cases of Covid-19 in the country and 306 more fatalities, Reuters reports. It brings the total to 2,423,928 infections and 228,146 deaths, according to health ministry data released on Wednesday. Spanish regions with a low Covid infection rate will be allowed to reopen nightlife before herd immunity is achieved, which is expected by mid-August, the health minister said. The Canadian province of Ontario will keep schools closed for in-person learning until the new school year starts in September, premier Doug Ford announced. Germany plans to pay vaccine manufacturers an annual reservation fee to build up reserve capacity of around 600-700m doses per year to help it fight future pandemics, the health minister said. Colombia has began what its government called a gradual opening of its border with Venezuela after a 14-month closure intended to curb the spread of the coronavirus. In Germany, the Robert Koch Institute has confirmed that a third wave of the virus has been broken. EU governments have agreed to add Japan to their small list of countries from which they will allow non-essential travel, it was reported earlier.","charCount":"35869","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"Mattha Busby (now); <a href=\"profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a> and <a href=\"profile/helen-davidson\">Helen Davidson</a> (earlier)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/live/2021/jun/03/uk-covid-live-news-coronavirus-schools-pupils-indian-nepal-delta-variant-latest-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-03T11:27:11Z","webTitle":"UK Covid live: number of people testing positive in England rises by 22%","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2021/jun/03/uk-covid-live-news-coronavirus-schools-pupils-indian-nepal-delta-variant-latest-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/live/2021/jun/03/uk-covid-live-news-coronavirus-schools-pupils-indian-nepal-delta-variant-latest-updates","fields":{"headline":"UK Covid live: number of people testing positive in England rises by 22%","standfirst":"<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2021/jun/03/uk-covid-live-news-coronavirus-schools-pupils-indian-nepal-delta-variant-latest-updates?page=with:block-60b8b5e08f082e80569f4e0b#block-60b8b5e08f082e80569f4e0b\">New cases are almost a quarter higher than previous week</a>; Scotland looking into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2021/jun/03/uk-covid-live-news-coronavirus-schools-pupils-indian-nepal-delta-variant-latest-updates?page=with:block-60b8a4e58f082e80569f4cc6#block-60b8a4e58f082e80569f4cc6\">whether new variants have greater impact on children</a></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/jun/03/covid-generation-children-england-risk-lost-learning-schools\">Generation of children in England at risk from lost learning, says expert</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/jun/03/schools-should-not-send-exam-year-pupils-home-early-says-ofsted-head\">Schools should not send exam-year pupils home early, says Ofsted head</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus – latest updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul>","trailText":"New cases are almost a quarter higher than previous week; Scotland looking into whether new variants have greater impact on children","byline":"Nicola Slawson","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f6ddca8237913a418c32c4be4bd045df455ce8b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f6ddca8237913a418c32c4be4bd045df455ce8b7/0_0_5040_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Staff at university hospital Monklands in Airdrie, Scotland, in full PPE in February.

A total of 17,162 people tested positive for Covid-19 in the country at least once in the week to 26 May according to the latest test and trace figures. That is a rise of more than a fifth on the previous week and the highest number of people to test positive since the week to 14 April, PA Media reports. Meanwhile the number of rapid Covid-19 tests carried out in England has fallen to its lowest level in six weeks. All members of the public are eligible to take two of these quick lateral flow device (LFD) tests a week. Just over 4.8 million rapid tests were carried out in England in the week to 26 May, the latest figures show. It is the fifth week in a row that the number has fallen. It is down from a peak of just over 7.6 million LFD tests in the week to 17 March, which coincided with the return of secondary students to school. The rapid tests can be done at home and give results in 30 minutes or less without the need for processing in a laboratory. They are different to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests which are processed in a lab, and are used mainly for anyone who has Covid-19 symptoms and to confirm a positive rapid test result. One million polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests were conducted in the week to 26 May, the highest total for two months, and up 3% on the previous week. The latest Test and Trace figures show that 1.0 million polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests were conducted in the week to 26 May. This is the highest total for two months – since the week to 24 March – and is up 3% on the previous week, PA Media reports. PCR tests are swab tests that are processed in a laboratory, and are used mainly for anyone who has Covid-19 symptoms and to confirm a positive rapid test result. Schools in England should continue to educate pupils for the remainder of the school year, rather than giving them an extended holiday as “study leave” for exams that were cancelled, the head of the Ofsted has said. Amanda Spielman, Her Majesty’s chief inspector of schools, said it was “concerning” that secondary schools were allowing pupils on GCSE and A-level courses to end the summer term six weeks or more early, meaning that some 15 and 16-year-olds would have 100 days of holiday before the new year started in September. Spielman said Ofsted “will want to know” how schools are using the remainder of the term to help their pupils in the exam year groups – year 11 and year 13 – catch up on learning lost during the pandemic lockdowns. Schools usually allow students to go on study leave before their exams. This year exams for GCSEs, BTecs and A-levels have been cancelled and replaced by teacher assessment, but many schools still allowed students to leave at the end of May, after the deadline for work to be included in teacher assessments. Spielman said in a statement to the Guardian: The Department for Education has set clear expectations for schools to encourage year 11 and 13 pupils to continue their education during the last half of the summer term, even if the work they do doesn’t contribute towards their final grades. This makes sense as many pupils have struggled to learn remotely, and so haven’t got as far as they might otherwise have done. This leaves them less well-prepared for post-16 or post-18 education, so it is concerning that some pupils could be allowed to finish the term early. We will want to know how schools are using the remainder of the summer term for these year groups. Read the full story here: A total of 17,162 people tested positive for Covid-19 in England at least once in the week to 26 May, up 22% on the previous week, according to the latest test and trace figures. It is the highest number of people testing positive since the week to 14 April, PA news reports. The UK government is “open-minded” on SNP calls to extend furlough, and there will be no post-Covid austerity measures, according to the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove. Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has called for the job support scheme to be extended “for as long as it is needed”, ahead of four nations recovery summit this afternoon. The meeting was cancelled at short notice last week after Sturgeon and her Welsh counterpart, Mark Drakeford, said the agenda was far too woolly. The summit was proposed by Boris Johnson immediately after the SNP won a landslide victory in the Holyrood elections and Welsh Labour won 50% of the seats in the Welsh Senedd, in what was seen as evidence of a more conciliatory approach by the Tories in London in response to the upsurge in support for independence in both nations. Speaking to the BBC’s Good Morning Scotland, Gove said he was “open-minded” on the furlough proposal, adding it was a “huge success” that was only possible “thanks to the broad shoulders of the UK Treasury”. He insisted there would be no austerity measures following the Covid crisis: We’ll be spending more on the NHS, education, criminal justice, because in all of these areas its absolutely vital that we build back better... the extra funding for everyone across the UK will continue. A generation of children is at risk of being failed by the government if it does not properly address the educational needs caused by lost learning during the Covid pandemic, a social mobility expert has said. The comments came after the unexpected resignation of the government’s schools recovery chief, Sir Kevan Collins, who quit on Wednesday in protest over its watered-down offer of £1.5bn in funding to help schoolchildren in England catch up on lost learning – a tenth of the £15bn he had recommended. In his resignation letter, Collins said “the half-hearted approach risks failing thousands of pupils” and fell “far short” of what was needed to meet the scale of the challenge. He warned disadvantaged and vulnerable children would suffer most and the impact was likely to be “particularly severe” in parts of the country where schools were closed for longer, such as the north. Lee Elliot Major, a professor of social mobility at Exeter University, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that children in England had lost 110 of 190 classroom days, and about 2 million children received no learning at all during the first lockdown. Describing Collins as “one of the most respected” people in the sector, the professor said he would not have taken the decision to step down lightly. “I just hope it’s a wake-up call for government to see this as the beginning of a much bigger, more ambitious programme. Read the full story here: The Scottish government’s minister for Covid recovery has said that he is currently reviewing whether new variants of the virus are having a greater impact on children, with numbers on under 10s hospitalised “on the high side”.

Swinney told BBC Scotland’s Good Morning Scotland: If you go back over the last 12 months relatively few children have been hospitalised as a consequence of Covid. We’re really seeing obviously a concentration of hospitalisation outwith the over 50s group, because the overwhelming majority of that group are vaccinated and have some protection. The current numbers [for children hospitalised] are on the high side, and certainly over the period of Covid we’ve not seen very many children hospitalised but we are seeing a number just now. So we have to look at all of these factors to determine is there something in the new variants that are emerging that is making it more acutely challenging for children with a greater health impact? Matt Hancock has said that an internationally agreed approach to coronavirus vaccine certification remains “some way off”. Speaking ahead of a G7 health ministers’ meeting, the health secretary told reporters: Ultimately there are a number of countries around the world that have said they’re definitely going to have a requirement to be vaccinated in order to travel. We’re making sure that here any Brit can see their vaccine status. But we’re some way off having an internationally agreed approach for that. It’s something we talk about and are discussing but there’s still a lot of work to do. Health secretary Matt Hancock has said it remains “too early” to say whether all coronavirus restrictions can end on 21 June. Speaking ahead of a G7 health ministers’ meeting, he told reporters: It’s too early to say what the decision will be about step four of the road map, which is scheduled to be no earlier than 21 June. Of course I look at those data every day, we publish them every day, the case numbers matter but what really matters is how that translates into the number of people going to hospital, the number of people sadly dying. The vaccine breaks that link - the question is how much the link has yet been broken because the majority of people who ended up in hospital are not fully vaccinated. That’s a good sign if you like because it means that the vaccine is clearly protecting people from ending up in hospital but it also demonstrates that we need to keep going with this vaccine programme. The UK government is “open-minded” about extending the furlough scheme, a leading member of Boris Johnson’s cabinet has insisted. Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon will use a four-nations summit with the Prime Minister on Thursday to push for the job retention scheme to continue beyond its current September expiry date. Now Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove has indicated it could be continued. Asked about the possibility of this, he said: “We are open minded, yes.” Speaking ahead of the four-nations summit on tackling Covid, Gove said the initiative, which sees the taxpayer pay cash towards workers’ wages, had been a “huge success” that was only possible “thanks to the broad shoulders of the UK Treasury”. The UK government minister insisted higher spending as a response to the coronavirus pandemic would continue, as the country as a whole seeks to “build back better”. The Scottish government has voiced concerns about a possible return to austerity from the Conservatives at Westminster, but Gove told BBC Radio Scotland’s Good Morning Scotland programme: We’ll be spending more. We’ll be spending more on the NHS, we will be spending more on education, we will be spending more on criminal justice, because in all of these areas it is absolutely vital that we build back better. Extra funding for everyone will continue, and it is important we all learn from each other about how that money should be spent. His comments come ahead of a virtual coronavirus recovery summit involved Johnson and the leaders of the devolved governments in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast. The rearranged meeting was due to take place last week but was postponed after the first ministers of Wales and Scotland pulled out because they wanted it to be a “meaningful discussion with substantive outcomes”. Both Sturgeon and Mark Drakeford subsequently wrote to the prime minister asking for more substance and clarity about the summit. There is growing speculation that popular holiday islands could be added to the government’s travel green list on Thursday. Spanish and Greek islands plus Malta are among the destinations which experts believe may be given green status. That would mean people visiting those locations from the UK will no longer be required to quarantine on their return. Robert Boyle, a former director of strategy at British Airways’ parent company IAG, predicted that a number of summer hotspots will be added to the green tier. He wrote in a blog post: It still seems very likely that whilst Spain and Greece will not make it onto the green list, many of their islands will, due to lower case rates and higher vaccinations than on the mainland. Malta, Finland and Slovakia are fairly safe bets, based on high testing rates and low reported cases. Paul Charles, chief executive of travel consultancy The PC Agency, said a number of popular holiday destinations “really deserve” to be moved to the low-risk tier. He expects additions to the green list to include the Greek islands of Zante, Rhodes and Kos, the Caribbean islands of Grenada and Antigua, plus Malta and Finland. But he said he would be “surprised” if Spain’s Balearic Islands, including Ibiza, Majorca and Menorca, were added on Thursday. He told the PA news agency: They’re hugely popular and I’m not sure the government is ready to encourage so much travel at the moment. Portugal is the only viable major tourist destination currently on the green list, but there have been reports it could be downgraded to amber. The government has urged people to avoid non-essential travel to amber and red countries. Travellers returning from amber list locations - which include popular hotspots such as Spain, France, Italy and Greece - must quarantine at home for 10 days and take two post-arrival tests. Several additions to the red list are expected on Thursday. Boyle explained that Bahrain, Costa Rica, Trinidad and Tobago and Kuwait “ought to be on the list” due to “very high infection rates”, whereas Mr Charles warned that Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia and Indonesia could be added as there are “signs of increased infection in many parts of Asia”. People returning to the UK from a red country are required to spend 11 nights in a quarantine hotel, at a cost of 1,750 for solo travellers. Assessments of travel lists are based on a range of factors, including the proportion of a population that has been vaccinated, rates of infection, emerging new variants, and access to reliable scientific data and genomic sequencing. The public should “exercise their common sense” about travelling abroad, a home office minister has said. Asked on Times Radio whether her department would rather people stayed in the UK, Victoria Atkins said: We’re very, very, very supportive of the traffic light system. There are some countries in the world at the moment that because of the variants and the rates of infection are simply too dangerous for us to visit in terms of Covid, and of course they are on the red list. We then have the amber list which we very much ask people not to travel to unless there are very particular, very dire consequences they’re having to deal with, such as a dying relative, and then the green list. And look, the overall goal, we all want to get back to normality, pre-pandemic normality. But I think all understand we’ve got to take careful steps to do that. And so the travel plan and travel lists are very much part of our road map out of lockdown restrictions, but we do have to look at the data. We do have to look at what is happening elsewhere in the world, in order to help advise the public as to what is allowed and what is not allowed. But as with anything, we’re asking the public to exercise their common sense and that is the way that we’re going to be able to return to normality. Senior Tory MP Robert Halfon said the government must “decide their priorities in terms of education” and that the Treasury can “find the money from the back of the sofa”, where there is the political will. The chairman of the education select committee told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: Of course there are funding constraints but the treasury announced over 16 billion extra for defence only last year, we’ve got 800 million being spent on a new research agency, 200 million being spent on a yacht. So where there is the political will, the treasury can find the money from the back of the sofa, and there has to be that political will because we need a long-term plan for education, a proper funding settlement.” He said the damage caused by Covid-19 to younger children “has been nothing short of disastrous”. He added: We need some radical thinking, some thinking out of the box, a proper long-term plan (for education) and I will keep campaigning for that, and a proper funding settlement so that that plan is properly resourced. Home Office minister Victoria Atkins told Sky News the amount allocated by the government to help pupils catch up after the pandemic was “huge”. She said the government was “determined to get (children) back on track” and insisted the 1.4 billion announced on Wednesday for tutoring was “a huge amount of money”. Atkins said the government’s education recovery fund was “very much focused on what we can deliver and deliver quickly”, despite former catch-up tsar Sir Kevan Collins citing in his resignation statement that the package of support is “too narrow, too small and will be delivered too slowly”. She told Sky News the government was “continuing to look at things like lengthening the school day”. She said she had not read the resignation statement issued by Collins. Asked on Sky News whether the government was doing enough for children worst affected by the pandemic, especially in the north and more deprived areas where Collins said impacts would be “particularly severe”, the home office minister said: “Well, I haven’t read his statement. I’m not sure that was quite the point he was making at that point, if I may say so.” She said: But what I’m saying is the point about targeting those children who are most affected by the pandemic is absolutely what this money is about. We want to have a course of tutoring, 15-hour tutoring courses for up to six million of these courses, that’s 100 million tuition hours extra that this money is paying for. And it’s going to be helping those children who are most disadvantaged by this. We’ve got to spend this money wisely, we want it to have the most impact it can possibly have, and that’s why, looking at the evidence that we’ve seen thus far we’re focusing on this one-to-one tuition, to really try to boost children’s chances in the years ahead. Shadow treasury minister James Murray said Labour’s proposals for a catch-up fund would have seen a similar amount of investment as suggested by Sir Kevan Collins. Murray told Sky News: I think what the government has been exposed as having done is not prioritising children’s education, not prioritising the wellbeing of children, and this is the chancellor’s responsibility for not putting the funding forward. He said the funding from the plans should come from “Covid reserves”. If the government does not properly address education needs, a whole generation of children could be failed, an expert has said. Dr Lee Elliot Major, professor of social mobility at the University of Exeter, described departing education tsar Sir Kevan Collins as “one of the most respected” people in the sector and said he would not have taken the decision to step down lightly. Major said “at least 10 times the amounts that were announced yesterday would be needed for children to have a chance of catching up”. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: I just hope that it’s a wake-up call for government to see this as the beginning of a much bigger, more ambitious programme. What we do know, and I think there is a lot of evidence around this, is that extra teaching for children will have huge benefits. And remember this is an investment for the future. If we don’t address these issues now the real fear is that we will fail a whole generation. This is about a whole generation of children and so my belief is that there is compelling evidence that, if done well, if you extend teaching, then that will help us catch up. I don’t see any other way of doing it.","charCount":"19600","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/nicola-slawson\">Nicola Slawson</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2021/jun/03/israel-fragile-anti-netanyahu-coalition-race-sworn-in","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-03T11:17:33Z","webTitle":"Israel’s fragile anti-Netanyahu coalition in race to get sworn in","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/03/israel-fragile-anti-netanyahu-coalition-race-sworn-in","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/jun/03/israel-fragile-anti-netanyahu-coalition-race-sworn-in","fields":{"headline":"Israel’s fragile anti-Netanyahu coalition in race to get sworn in","standfirst":"<p>Country’s longest-serving PM has gathered allies in bid to work out how to knock down coalition</p>","trailText":"Country’s longest-serving PM has gathered allies in bid to work out how to knock down coalition","byline":"Oliver Holmes in Jerusalem","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f0b162c42d243fa485bea69613b0f8197930db18\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0b162c42d243fa485bea69613b0f8197930db18/0_118_1890_1134/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Naftali Bennett, left, and Yair Lapid\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Naftali Bennett, left, and Yair Lapid, who have agreed to form a coalition to oust Netanyahu.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ammar Awad/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure>","body":"<p>Israeli opposition politicians set on ejecting Benjamin Netanyahu from office are rushing to establish a government, as the country’s longest-serving prime minister gathered allies for an emergency meeting to strategise how to knock down the fragile coalition.</p> \n<p>A day after the opposition head, Yair Lapid, announced that he and Naftali Bennett – his far-right partner and prime minister in waiting – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/02/yair-lapid-israel-president-government-naftali-bennett-benjamin-netanyahu\">could form a “government of change”</a>, the race was on to get it voted on in parliament and sworn in.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"cc331fb9-3698-4631-a4fe-6f526c2a5369\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>A telegenic former TV news anchor popular with secular middle-class Israelis, Yair Lapid was charged with forging a governing coalition before the deadline on 2 June.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Lapid’s Yesh Atid party has promised to lower the cost of living and reduce the power of religious authorities, for example, by bringing in civil marriage.</p>\n    <p>The 57-year-old has described himself as a centrist and somebody who supports a two-state solution.

The Victorian government wants the facility to house high-risk travellers currently in hotel quarantine, while the commonwealth wants to expand capacity for Australians returning from overseas. With the national cabinet due to meet on Friday, and with the prime minister keen to unveil the quarantine agreement, Guardian Australia understands Canberra has agreed to contribute $200m for a 500 bed facility, likely at Avalon, but there is not yet complete unanimity between the two jurisdictions. As well as the down-to-the-wire wrangling over the quarantine facility, the Victorian government is also unhappy with the emergency support the Morrison government unveiled on Thursday to help workers stranded without income during the current lockdown, which will extend into a second week. After days of public criticism from the acting Victorian premier James Merlino about a lack of support from Canberra, Scott Morrison on Thursday announced a disaster payment that would be made available to workers in areas declared a commonwealth hotspot when any lockdown lasted longer than seven days. Morrison said a payment of $500 a week would be available for employees working more than 20 hours in a week, and a $325 payment for people working less than 20 hours. But the Victorian government thinks that income support, which is less than the minimum wage, is inadequate, and there was also confusion about Morrison’s presentation of the post jobkeeper income support arrangements. Morrison flagged two options before further discussion at Friday’s national cabinet meeting. The first was the states pay for support to businesses and Canberra cover workers, and the second was cost sharing for both businesses and employees. The disaster payment announced on Thursday will only go to people older than 17, who were working before the lockdown and who can no longer work. They will need to have less than $10,000 in savings. There are also further restrictions including whether other leave – beyond annual and sick leave – is available to cover the lockdown period. People already receiving income or business support, or the pandemic leave disaster payment, will not be eligible either. The support will be available for Australian citizens, permanent residents and eligible working visa holders. The prime minister has been under significant political pressure this week about the slow pace of the national vaccination rollout and about a lack of standalone quarantine facilities to house travellers returning from high risk zones. With concerns persisting about the adequacy of hotel quarantine, the Morrison government has been in discussions with Merlino about a quarantine facility in Victoria for some weeks. Guardian Australia understands that officials arrived at an agreement about the principles that would underpin a joint agreement on a facility on Wednesday night, and a memorandum of understanding was sent to Melbourne on Thursday with a view to a formal announcement coinciding with national cabinet. There have been two sites in contention, one at Avalon airport and an alternative in Mickleham which is currently a site for animal quarantine. The MOU does not nominate a particular site, but both governments are understood to favour Avalon. While agreement seems close, with both governments keen to proceed with the proposal, a deal had not been struck on Thursday night. Morrison has been clear he does not want dedicated quarantine facilities to replace hotel quarantine, and he wants any standalone facilities to be close to capital cities and close to major hospitals to deal with travellers who present with Covid infections. Government sources confirmed while an agreement on Friday was likely, the two governments were still resolving differences on Thursday night. Three new coronavirus cases were recorded in Victoria overnight. While the lockdown in the state has been extended, restrictions in regional Victoria were lifted. Trade unions and welfare advocates welcomed the government’s decision to provide income support for workers facing lockdowns without the jobseeker wage subsidy, which wound up in March, but said the payments were not enough. Labor and the Greens in Canberra were lukewarm about Morrison’s proposal for income support. The shadow treasurer Jim Chalmers said the fact that federal assistance only flows from the second week of any lockdown was not done for policy reasons but for “political considerations”. The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, argued the support would leave people in poverty. “For a casual working 20 hours a week $325 is not enough – that is less than the minimum wage, and below the rent on an average one-bedroom apartment”.","charCount":"4877","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/katharine-murphy\">Katharine Murphy</a>, <a href=\"profile/sarah-martin\">Sarah Martin</a> and <a href=\"profile/josh-taylor\">Josh Taylor</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2021/jun/03/chinas-splinternet-blockchain-state-control-of-cyberspace","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-03T11:14:10Z","webTitle":"China’s ‘splinternet’ will create a state-controlled alternative cyberspace","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/jun/03/chinas-splinternet-blockchain-state-control-of-cyberspace","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2021/jun/03/chinas-splinternet-blockchain-state-control-of-cyberspace","fields":{"headline":"China’s ‘splinternet’ will create a state-controlled alternative cyberspace","standfirst":"<p>Beijing is using blockchain to build a new internet and many developing countries are likely to sign up – but at what cost?</p>","trailText":"Beijing is using blockchain to build a new internet and many developing countries are likely to sign up – but at what cost?","byline":"Flavia Kenyon","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"32a6918eb5efe4c4df6773300a2a44333bfa9c39\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32a6918eb5efe4c4df6773300a2a44333bfa9c39/0_67_5500_3301/1000.jpg\" alt=\"blockchain art\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of the world’s first exhibitions of blockchain art – Virtual Niche: Have You Ever Seen Memes in the Mirror? – was held in Beijing in March. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicolas Asfouri/AFP/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Cyberspace is one huge, unregulated mess.

Chi-Raq (2015)</a></h2> <p>Samuel L Jackson is the elegantly besuited, cane-twirling, fourth-wall-breaking narrator in Spike Lee’s Chi-Raq (pronounced “shy-rack”), set in the city of Chicago, where the homicide rate has exceeded the US death toll in Iraq. It is a twist on Aristophanes’s Lysistrata, about one woman’s mission to end the Peloponnesian war with a sex strike. Teyonah Parris plays Lysistrata, the girlfriend of a gangbanger. She reaches out to the wives and partners of their enemies with a similar idea – and the chant: “No peace, no pussy!” Jackson is the dapper, impish Dolmedes, whose rhyming couplets bring us into the story.</p> <h2>19. One Eight Seven (1997)</h2> <p>So often, Jackson’s roles are flavoured by violence or cynicism or black comedy, but there is a strong streak of idealism in his performing identity. So it proves in this social-issue thriller named after the California police code for homicide. Jackson plays Trevor, a dedicated teacher who works in a tough New York school, survives a horrendous stabbing by a pupil and winds up as a substitute teacher in Los Angeles. There, his personality appears changed: he is more grimly determined to survive. That determination takes the movie to melodramatic places, but Jackson’s performance is muscular and forthright.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jan/19/goodfellas-review-martin-scorsese-robert-de-niro-joe-pesci-ray-liotta\">18. Goodfellas (1990)</a></h2> <p>Jackson is often regarded as quite the snappy dresser, but sadly there was nothing snappy about the way he dressed for his big cameo in Martin Scorsese’s celebrated gangster film – in loose vest and underpants. He plays minor hoodlum “Stacks” Edwards, who had, as they say, one job. For the Lufthansa robbery run by Henry (Ray Liotta) and Jimmy the Gent (Robert De Niro), Stacks was entrusted with getting rid of the van. He neglected to do so, rendering himself vulnerable to arrest and likely to squeal. So Stacks is roused from a lie-in at 11.30am by Joe Pesci’s psychopathic Tommy DeVito; Stacks stumbles apologetically to the door in his underwear and then – incautiously – turns his back on Tommy as he bends to put his clothes on. With the sickening gunshot, Jackson lurches forward, bounces off the bed and hits the floor.</p> <h2>17. Jurassic Park (1993)</h2> <p>“Hold on to your butts!” Jackson has another celebrated cameo as Ray Arnold, the droll engineer in charge of Jurassic Park’s automated rides. His famous line is uttered when he has to shut everything down and start it up again when a hurricane strikes, dinosaurs are at large and the park’s systems have been sabotaged by Wayne Knight’s slobbish and corrupt programmer, Dennis Nedry. Tragically, Ray is to meet a horrible off-camera demise, gobbled by a velociraptor, leaving only his arm. Jackson gives an object lesson in how to make the most of a small role; here, he is one of cinema’s most dedicated smokers, never seen without a cigarette.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ece2cbb6e1e32ce578e10058b4b532effae188a4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ece2cbb6e1e32ce578e10058b4b532effae188a4/0_123_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Black Snake Moan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Blues power … Jackson with Christina Ricci in the curious Black Snake Moan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paramount/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>16. Black Snake Moan (2006)</h2> <p>One of Jackson’s strangest and yet somehow most elegant performances, treasured by his fans. He is a farmer and retired blues musician significantly named Lazarus, who is dying of loneliness. One day, he finds a beautiful young woman called Rae, played by Christina Ricci, who has been beaten and left unconscious by the road by local folk, apparently as a punishment for her promiscuity. Lazarus takes her home and chains her to a radiator, while he tells her about his life and plays her some music – all avowedly to teach her some self-respect. Or is it his own self-respect he is trying to reclaim? This is part southern gothic, part Euro arthouse and all Jackson. No one else could have sold us this bizarre premise.</p> <h2>15. Die Hard With a Vengeance (1995)</h2> <p>The third Die Hard movie featuring the tough cop John McClane, this paired Jackson with Bruce Willis for a scary confrontation with another creepy German villain played by a Brit thesp. Jeremy Irons is Simon, the brother of the German played by Alan Rickman whom Willis was up against in the first film. Crazy-evil genius Simon places bombs all over Manhattan and forces Willis to stand in the middle of Harlem wearing a racist placard or else he will detonate one. Jackson is Zeus, the tough store-owner who saves McClane from the inevitable angry mob and senses that that this shirtless man is on the side of the angels. Together, they are drawn into Simon’s evil cat-and-mouse game. Jackson makes a very good ordinary guy turned action hero.</p> <h2>14. A Time to Kill (1996)</h2> <p>A grandstanding performance here from Jackson in this John Grisham legal thriller set in the US south. He plays Carl Lee Hailey, the regular guy whose 10-year-old daughter is raped by two racist thugs. Hailey guns down the culprits while they are on their way to a hearing, spraying them with bullets, and in doing so gravely injures a nearby white deputy played by Chris Cooper, who sympathises with him. Matthew McConaughey plays the liberal lawyer who takes Hailey’s side. But, as Hailey tells him: “America is at war and you are on the other side.” He has chosen him as his lawyer precisely because he is a white man who thinks as a white jury thinks.

Snakes on a Plane (2006)</a></h2> <p>“I have had it with these motherfuckin’ snakes on this motherfuckin’ plane!” Just one of the deathless lines in the high-concept thriller featuring Jackson as an FBI officer escorting a witness on a flight to Los Angeles, where his testimony could put away a gangster for life. But the gangster has somehow stashed a huge crate of angry snakes in the hold, with a timer device to blow the lid off. The snakes get into the cabin because a couple in the toilet rip out the smoke alarm, causing a hole, so they can skin up; one of the great moralist-symbolist scenes of 21st-century Hollywood. Soon the plane is crawling and slithering and the passengers have a Freudian nightmare on their hands. At the time, Snakes on a Plane was thought to be the future of cinema, because it crowdsourced its screenplay ideas at the development stage from online fans (or got huge publicity for claiming that it did). Jackson is the epitome of cool as he grabs a snake by the tail and whipcracks its head against an overhead cabin.</p> <h2>7. Jungle Fever (1991)</h2> <p>Jackson plays a mouthy crack addict called Gator in Lee’s film about the sexual politics of interracial romance. Gator does an intensely irritating little dance, which exasperates his character’s strait-laced brother Flipper, played by Wesley Snipes. When Flipper has an affair with a beautiful Italian-American co-worker, Angie, played by Annabella Sciorra, his marriage breaks down and he finds himself thrown as never before on the mercies of his disapproving family and out-of-control loser brother.

Jackie Brown (1997)</h2> <p>Tarantino gives Jackson some tasty lines and there is scarcely anything lairier than the speech delivered by Jackson’s gun runner Ordell Robbie, while watching a video entitled Chicks Who Love Guns. “Here we go. AK-47. The very best there is. When you absolutely, positively got to kill every motherfucker in the room, accept no substitutes. This here’s the Chinese model. I get ’em for $850, double my money.” He is watching it on the couch with his buddy and former cellmate Louis Gara, played by De Niro, with whom he is later to have a very stressful conversation in their VW van. It is a conversation that ends with a chilling demonstration of violence and Ordell’s sorrowful remark: “What the fuck happened to you, man? Your ass used to be beautiful.”</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/nov/19/the-incredibles-film-review\">5. The Incredibles (2004)</a></h2> <p>Jackson did some joyous voice work on this Pixar classic, playing Frozone, the best friend and ally of Mr Incredible, as both have to come to terms with the fact that “supers” are no longer needed in the modern US. His booming voice endowed another line with classic status: as a crime situation develops in the street, Frozone realises that he should deal with it as a super, but is aghast to see his suit isn’t where it should be. He shouts to his wife: “Honey, wheeeere’s my suuuupersuit?” and so becomes the voice of every suburban husband, super or not, in the US.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/dec/29/culture.peterbradshaw\">4. Unbreakable (2000)</a></h2> <p>Jackson gives one of his most eccentric performances in this early film from M Night Shyamalan. Willis plays David, a security guard who somehow emerges unscathed from a train crash that kills everybody else. It appears that he has the superpower of unbreakability, which attracts the attention of Elijah, a connoisseur comic-book dealer played by Jackson who has a genetic disorder that means the slightest impact will break his bones. He believes he is the polar opposite to David, that their destinies are fused and that David has to follow his vocation as a superhero. It is a great performance from Jackson: his angular presence shimmers with charismatic hauteur.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"924979554fddd1fc7d3a362e37244b03e0cbbf22\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/924979554fddd1fc7d3a362e37244b03e0cbbf22/0_0_3400_2041/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Django Unchained\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Audacious and provocative … with Leonardo DiCaprio and Christoph Waltz in Django Unchained.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/The Weinstein Company</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jan/17/django-unchained-review\">3. Django Unchained (2012)</a></h2> <p>Tarantino’s outrageously brash revenge western, set on a slave plantation in the antebellum US, features one of Jackson’s most brilliant and controversial performances. The revolting plantation owner, Calvin Candie, is played by Leonardo DiCaprio; Jamie Foxx is the rebellious slave Django; and Jackson plays Candie’s household servant Stephen, a satirical Uncle Tom figure with a bald head, a death-ray stare and a Parkinson’s-type tremor, who is fanatically loyal to the master and deeply suspicious of Django. In 2012, Hollywood was nervous about slavery in a way it isn’t now, but the character of Stephen would be audacious and provocative at any time.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/dec/05/film-review-lakeview-terrace\">2. Lakeview Terrace (2008)</a></h2> <p>Probably Jackson’s most underappreciated turn, in this disquieting drama from the screenwriters David Loughery and Howard Korder and the director Neil LaBute. A hip young couple, Lisa and Chris, played by Kerry Washington and Patrick Wilson, move into a pleasant street and are instantly creeped out by their neighbour Abel, played by Jackson. He is a fiercely conservative LAPD cop and widower who runs his own one-man neighbourhood watch scheme and is bringing up two children with iron discipline. One day, Abel finds them giggling at an upstairs window and sees they are looking down at the neighbours having carefree sex in their pool. Disgusted by their licentiousness, and perhaps also that they are an interracial couple, he begins a campaign of harassment. When Jackson wants to turn the intimidation up to 11, there is no one more disturbing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6236edd46fb190bd4f09b60a8385062e1343faa5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6236edd46fb190bd4f09b60a8385062e1343faa5/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pulp Fiction\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘And you will know my name is the Lord’ … Jackson’s star-making turn in Pulp Fiction.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Miramax/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/15/pulp-fiction-review\">1. Pulp Fiction (1994)</a></h2> <p>“The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother’s keeper and the finder of lost children, and I will strike down upon thee, with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers and you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee!” In the terrifying <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mnb_3ibUp38&amp;ab_channel=Miramax\">“Big Kahuna burger” scene</a> from Pulp Fiction, Jackson’s extraordinary hitman, Jules, is citing the King James version of Ezekiel 25:17, but has evidently rewritten it, absorbing Psalm 23 and Genesis 4. (Generations of filmgoers think that it is a real quote, in the same way they think there really is a homoerotic line about “riding my tail” in Top Gun.)</p> <p>Jules and Vincent (played by John Travolta) show up at the apartment of some kids who have attempted to doublecross their employer, Marsellus. Jules’s chilling capacity for violence is even more stunning given that we have so recently seen him gently bantering with his colleague about burgers, Europe and foot massages. Jules is a little vexed that the kid he is threatening with a gun easily guesses why the French call a quarter-pounder with cheese a “Royale”, when this question had stumped him. This quasi-biblical quote is also the climactic moment of the restaurant scene at the end, in which Jules coolly brazens out being held up by Tim Roth’s character, whom he calls “Ringo”, citing exactly the same text, but now saying that he may have misinterpreted it.</p> <p>Jackson’s killer Jules is an amazing creation: super-cool, unfazed by anything, a pop-culture prophet and a seer, with a strange sense of the mystical and the sublime. Jackson was hardly a newcomer when he took the role, being 46 years old, with 28 film credits behind him. But Jules seemed to emerge fully formed: the magnificent, blackly comic antihero who shaped our perception of everything Jackson did afterwards or before; and the yardstick of deadpan crime cool that every tough guy had to measure himself against.</p> <p>• The Hitman’s Wife’s Bodyguard is in UK cinemas from 18 June.</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"2","wordcount":"2845","commentCloseDate":"2021-06-06T11:00:08Z","commentable":"true","displayHint":"immersive","firstPublicationDate":"2021-06-03T11:00:08Z","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2021-06-03T11:01:08Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2021-06-04T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"The Guardian","shortUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/p/hj9n2","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6540460a722eb4891924fb6f09680a50d44cbaf/0_7_2700_1620/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","isLive":"true","bodyText":"20. Chi-Raq (2015) Samuel L Jackson is the elegantly besuited, cane-twirling, fourth-wall-breaking narrator in Spike Lee’s Chi-Raq (pronounced “shy-rack”), set in the city of Chicago, where the homicide rate has exceeded the US death toll in Iraq. It is a twist on Aristophanes’s Lysistrata, about one woman’s mission to end the Peloponnesian war with a sex strike. Teyonah Parris plays Lysistrata, the girlfriend of a gangbanger. She reaches out to the wives and partners of their enemies with a similar idea – and the chant: “No peace, no pussy!” Jackson is the dapper, impish Dolmedes, whose rhyming couplets bring us into the story. 19. One Eight Seven (1997) So often, Jackson’s roles are flavoured by violence or cynicism or black comedy, but there is a strong streak of idealism in his performing identity. So it proves in this social-issue thriller named after the California police code for homicide. Jackson plays Trevor, a dedicated teacher who works in a tough New York school, survives a horrendous stabbing by a pupil and winds up as a substitute teacher in Los Angeles. There, his personality appears changed: he is more grimly determined to survive. That determination takes the movie to melodramatic places, but Jackson’s performance is muscular and forthright. 18. Goodfellas (1990) Jackson is often regarded as quite the snappy dresser, but sadly there was nothing snappy about the way he dressed for his big cameo in Martin Scorsese’s celebrated gangster film – in loose vest and underpants. He plays minor hoodlum “Stacks” Edwards, who had, as they say, one job. For the Lufthansa robbery run by Henry (Ray Liotta) and Jimmy the Gent (Robert De Niro), Stacks was entrusted with getting rid of the van. He neglected to do so, rendering himself vulnerable to arrest and likely to squeal. So Stacks is roused from a lie-in at 11.30am by Joe Pesci’s psychopathic Tommy DeVito; Stacks stumbles apologetically to the door in his underwear and then – incautiously – turns his back on Tommy as he bends to put his clothes on. With the sickening gunshot, Jackson lurches forward, bounces off the bed and hits the floor. 17. Jurassic Park (1993) “Hold on to your butts!” Jackson has another celebrated cameo as Ray Arnold, the droll engineer in charge of Jurassic Park’s automated rides. His famous line is uttered when he has to shut everything down and start it up again when a hurricane strikes, dinosaurs are at large and the park’s systems have been sabotaged by Wayne Knight’s slobbish and corrupt programmer, Dennis Nedry. Tragically, Ray is to meet a horrible off-camera demise, gobbled by a velociraptor, leaving only his arm. Jackson gives an object lesson in how to make the most of a small role; here, he is one of cinema’s most dedicated smokers, never seen without a cigarette. 16. Black Snake Moan (2006) One of Jackson’s strangest and yet somehow most elegant performances, treasured by his fans. He is a farmer and retired blues musician significantly named Lazarus, who is dying of loneliness. One day, he finds a beautiful young woman called Rae, played by Christina Ricci, who has been beaten and left unconscious by the road by local folk, apparently as a punishment for her promiscuity. Lazarus takes her home and chains her to a radiator, while he tells her about his life and plays her some music – all avowedly to teach her some self-respect. Or is it his own self-respect he is trying to reclaim? This is part southern gothic, part Euro arthouse and all Jackson. No one else could have sold us this bizarre premise. 15. Die Hard With a Vengeance (1995) The third Die Hard movie featuring the tough cop John McClane, this paired Jackson with Bruce Willis for a scary confrontation with another creepy German villain played by a Brit thesp. Jeremy Irons is Simon, the brother of the German played by Alan Rickman whom Willis was up against in the first film. Crazy-evil genius Simon places bombs all over Manhattan and forces Willis to stand in the middle of Harlem wearing a racist placard or else he will detonate one. Jackson is Zeus, the tough store-owner who saves McClane from the inevitable angry mob and senses that that this shirtless man is on the side of the angels. Together, they are drawn into Simon’s evil cat-and-mouse game. Jackson makes a very good ordinary guy turned action hero. 14. A Time to Kill (1996) A grandstanding performance here from Jackson in this John Grisham legal thriller set in the US south. He plays Carl Lee Hailey, the regular guy whose 10-year-old daughter is raped by two racist thugs. Hailey guns down the culprits while they are on their way to a hearing, spraying them with bullets, and in doing so gravely injures a nearby white deputy played by Chris Cooper, who sympathises with him. Matthew McConaughey plays the liberal lawyer who takes Hailey’s side. But, as Hailey tells him: “America is at war and you are on the other side.” He has chosen him as his lawyer precisely because he is a white man who thinks as a white jury thinks. It is a big sweaty movie with big sweaty scenes and Jackson has the gravitas and credibility to carry it. 13. The Hateful Eight (2015) Quentin Tarantino’s movie is a chamber piece, set mostly in a confined space and featuring intimidating guys adept in the implied violence of talk. It is set just after the civil war, among bounty hunters who bring in wanted felons, dead or alive. One of these is the unionist veteran Major Marquis Warren, sumptuously played by Jackson, who has a couple of criminal corpses that he is transporting across country in the snow. Warren has an unhappy war record, but Jackson shows how deeply proud he is of having a letter from Abraham Lincoln. This is an outrageous, blackly comic performance of the type that only Tarantino knows how to get from Jackson: glittering of eye, steely of will and vengeful of manner. 12. Changing Lanes (2002) If there is one emotion Jackson can convey on screen, it is rage – and that is what he delivers in this Roger Michell drama, the title of which interestingly prefigures the “stay in your lane” jibe from many a social-media row. Ben Affleck plays Gavin, an obnoxious yuppie lawyer who gets into a fender-bender situation with Doyle, Jackson’s recovering alcoholic with anger-management problems. Both are on their way to a courtroom situation and pushed for time, but Affleck is high-handed and arrogant in ways that Jackson’s character can’t forgive. It all gets overheated, with a silly ending, but Jackson is compelling and charismatic. 11. The Long Kiss Goodnight (1996) Another of the big 90s action movies that featured Jackson paired with a white character, in this case the apparently respectable wife and mother Samantha, played by Geena Davis. She has built a happy life with her partner and child eight years after being found unconscious with no memory. But random events bring it all back: she used to be in a very dangerous occupation, some bad guys want to get her and the only person on her side is Mitch, the scuzzy private investigator she once hired. Jackson sells it hard, but it is not the part he was born for. 10. The Marvel Cinematic Universe There had to be a part for Jackson in the MCU and it was Colonel Nick Fury, perennially coiled with eponymous rage and sporting a piratical eyepatch. As head of the espionage and counter-terrorism agency Shield, he is sufficiently badass to act as a credible intermediary between the Avengers and the US government. His appearances in the MCU range from tiny and sometimes uncredited cameos to medium-sized appearances; his best is in Captain Marvel, in which he plays the young Fury in the 90s, digitally de-aged; he shows how he suffered that unfortunate ocular mishap. Jackson’s MCU roles, sub-ranked: 11. Thor (2011) 10. Avengers: Infinity War (2018) 9. Avengers: Endgame (2019) 8. Iron Man (2008) 7. Captain America: the First Avenger (2011) 6.

Do the Right Thing (1989) As with Chi-Raq, Lee gave Jackson a potent, choric role here: the quasi-narrator who floats free of the action. He is the charismatic local DJ, Mister Señor Love Daddy, who broadcasts live to the Bedford-Stuyvesant district of New York. Jackson’s is the droll, detached yet engaged voice who somehow embodies the fact that the temperature is inexorably climbing and there is about to be racial violence. He conveys that there is something inevitable about it all, and also has a kind of Olympian view, seeing and calmly judging everything. It is the kind of part that Jackson endows with enigmatic humour and his own brand of wisdom. 8. Snakes on a Plane (2006) “I have had it with these motherfuckin’ snakes on this motherfuckin’ plane!” Just one of the deathless lines in the high-concept thriller featuring Jackson as an FBI officer escorting a witness on a flight to Los Angeles, where his testimony could put away a gangster for life. But the gangster has somehow stashed a huge crate of angry snakes in the hold, with a timer device to blow the lid off. The snakes get into the cabin because a couple in the toilet rip out the smoke alarm, causing a hole, so they can skin up; one of the great moralist-symbolist scenes of 21st-century Hollywood.

Jackson is the epitome of cool as he grabs a snake by the tail and whipcracks its head against an overhead cabin. 7. Jungle Fever (1991) Jackson plays a mouthy crack addict called Gator in Lee’s film about the sexual politics of interracial romance. Gator does an intensely irritating little dance, which exasperates his character’s strait-laced brother Flipper, played by Wesley Snipes. When Flipper has an affair with a beautiful Italian-American co-worker, Angie, played by Annabella Sciorra, his marriage breaks down and he finds himself thrown as never before on the mercies of his disapproving family and out-of-control loser brother. Jackson took the part when he had just got out of rehab for crack addiction himself andfelt that he was in a unique position to show the addict’s desperate, delusional lifestyle. 6. Jackie Brown (1997) Tarantino gives Jackson some tasty lines and there is scarcely anything lairier than the speech delivered by Jackson’s gun runner Ordell Robbie, while watching a video entitled Chicks Who Love Guns. “Here we go. AK-47. The very best there is. When you absolutely, positively got to kill every motherfucker in the room, accept no substitutes. This here’s the Chinese model.

It is a conversation that ends with a chilling demonstration of violence and Ordell’s sorrowful remark: “What the fuck happened to you, man? Your ass used to be beautiful.” 5.

It appears that he has the superpower of unbreakability, which attracts the attention of Elijah, a connoisseur comic-book dealer played by Jackson who has a genetic disorder that means the slightest impact will break his bones. He believes he is the polar opposite to David, that their destinies are fused and that David has to follow his vocation as a superhero. It is a great performance from Jackson: his angular presence shimmers with charismatic hauteur. 3. Django Unchained (2012) Tarantino’s outrageously brash revenge western, set on a slave plantation in the antebellum US, features one of Jackson’s most brilliant and controversial performances. The revolting plantation owner, Calvin Candie, is played by Leonardo DiCaprio; Jamie Foxx is the rebellious slave Django; and Jackson plays Candie’s household servant Stephen, a satirical Uncle Tom figure with a bald head, a death-ray stare and a Parkinson’s-type tremor, who is fanatically loyal to the master and deeply suspicious of Django. In 2012, Hollywood was nervous about slavery in a way it isn’t now, but the character of Stephen would be audacious and provocative at any time. 2. Lakeview Terrace (2008) Probably Jackson’s most underappreciated turn, in this disquieting drama from the screenwriters David Loughery and Howard Korder and the director Neil LaBute. A hip young couple, Lisa and Chris, played by Kerry Washington and Patrick Wilson, move into a pleasant street and are instantly creeped out by their neighbour Abel, played by Jackson. He is a fiercely conservative LAPD cop and widower who runs his own one-man neighbourhood watch scheme and is bringing up two children with iron discipline. One day, Abel finds them giggling at an upstairs window and sees they are looking down at the neighbours having carefree sex in their pool. Disgusted by their licentiousness, and perhaps also that they are an interracial couple, he begins a campaign of harassment. When Jackson wants to turn the intimidation up to 11, there is no one more disturbing. 1. Pulp Fiction (1994) “The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother’s keeper and the finder of lost children, and I will strike down upon thee, with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers and you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee!” In the terrifying “Big Kahuna burger” scene from Pulp Fiction, Jackson’s extraordinary hitman, Jules, is citing the King James version of Ezekiel 25:17, but has evidently rewritten it, absorbing Psalm 23 and Genesis 4. (Generations of filmgoers think that it is a real quote, in the same way they think there really is a homoerotic line about “riding my tail” in Top Gun.) Jules and Vincent (played by John Travolta) show up at the apartment of some kids who have attempted to doublecross their employer, Marsellus. Jules’s chilling capacity for violence is even more stunning given that we have so recently seen him gently bantering with his colleague about burgers, Europe and foot massages. Jules is a little vexed that the kid he is threatening with a gun easily guesses why the French call a quarter-pounder with cheese a “Royale”, when this question had stumped him. This quasi-biblical quote is also the climactic moment of the restaurant scene at the end, in which Jules coolly brazens out being held up by Tim Roth’s character, whom he calls “Ringo”, citing exactly the same text, but now saying that he may have misinterpreted it. Jackson’s killer Jules is an amazing creation: super-cool, unfazed by anything, a pop-culture prophet and a seer, with a strange sense of the mystical and the sublime. Jackson was hardly a newcomer when he took the role, being 46 years old, with 28 film credits behind him. But Jules seemed to emerge fully formed: the magnificent, blackly comic antihero who shaped our perception of everything Jackson did afterwards or before; and the yardstick of deadpan crime cool that every tough guy had to measure himself against. • The Hitman’s Wife’s Bodyguard is in UK cinemas from 18 June.","charCount":"16374","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"true","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/peterbradshaw\">Peter Bradshaw</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"}]}}

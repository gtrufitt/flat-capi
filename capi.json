It might not have the same ring as “Dreamtime at the ‘G” but given the era of Covid that we live in, we should be grateful it is happening at all. And why not share the love? Optus Stadium will no doubt do the game justice, with ticket sales going gangbusters and the venue record for an AFL game – 59,608, for the 2018 preliminary final between West Coast and Melbourne – under serious threat.</p> <p>The pin-up match of Sir Doug Nicholls Round should be quite a contest, too, with both Richmond and Essendon in winning form and sniffing around the lower reaches of the top eight. A win for either team tonight will do their finals chances the world of good. For their part, the Bombers will be delighted to return to the stadium where last week they toppled West Coast. They will need to draw on the good vibes generated by that upset victory if they are to avoid an 11th successive defeat at the hands of the Tigers. </p> <p>Looking forward to this great fixture of the AFL calendar.

Essendon B: Jayden Laverde, Aaron Francis, Jordan Ridley HB: Dyson Heppell, James Stewart, Nick Hind C: Andrew McGrath, Zach Merrett, Nik Cox HF: Archie Perkins, Jake Stringer, Harrison Jones F: David Zaharakis, Cale Hooker, Anthony McDonald-Tipungwuti FOLL: Andrew Phillips, Darcy Parish, Kyle Langford I/C: Mason Redman, Matt Guelfi, Alec Waterman, Brayden Ham Sub: Patrick Ambrose Richmond B: Nick Vlastuin, Noah Balta, Dylan Grimes HB: Jayden Short, Nathan Broad, Bachar Houli C: Kamdyn McIntosh, Trent Cotchin, Josh Caddy HF: Jake Aarts, Shane Edwards, Jack Graham F: Callum Coleman-Jones, Dustin Martin, Jack Riewoldt FOLL: Mabior Chol, Shai Bolton, Dion Prestia I/C: Liam Baker, Marlion Pickett, Riley Collier-Dawkins, Jason Castagna Sub: Daniel Rioli Welcome back Aaron Francis, Marlion Pickett and Shane Edwards. Three double-barreled surnames. How refreshing! Good evening and welcome to Dreamtime in the west. It might not have the same ring as “Dreamtime at the ‘G” but given the era of Covid that we live in, we should be grateful it is happening at all. And why not share the love? Optus Stadium will no doubt do the game justice, with ticket sales going gangbusters and the venue record for an AFL game – 59,608, for the 2018 preliminary final between West Coast and Melbourne – under serious threat. The pin-up match of Sir Doug Nicholls Round should be quite a contest, too, with both Richmond and Essendon in winning form and sniffing around the lower reaches of the top eight. A win for either team tonight will do their finals chances the world of good. For their part, the Bombers will be delighted to return to the stadium where last week they toppled West Coast. They will need to draw on the good vibes generated by that upset victory if they are to avoid an 11th successive defeat at the hands of the Tigers. Looking forward to this great fixture of the AFL calendar.

Slow, slowish, quick, then quicker still, it all builds to the final act, the shoot-out on the fifth afternoon. Well, not this one. It has marched to the beat of a different drum: super-slow, super-quick, non-existent. Following yesterday’s wash-out, more than half the playing time has already elapsed, and we’ve only had an innings and a bit. The draw is such a hot favourite that if you decide to back it, you’ll have to shell out a tenner for every £3 you stand to win. </p> <p>If you are a betting person, the horse to back is surely New Zealand. Put a fiver on them and you could win £23. The rain, coming on top of Devon Conway’s dream debut, has left Kane Williamson in the driving seat. </p> <p>England, resuming on 111 for 2 and missing all their all-rounders (Stokes, Buttler, Woakes, Curran), could easily be bowled out for 250. That would take about half the day, leaving the other half for the New Zealanders to extend their lead. They could rattle up 200 by noon tomorrow, to hand England a target of about 330 in 80 overs. </p> <p>In a parallel universe, England would race to 450, bowl NZ out for 160, and win by eight wickets.

Slow, slowish, quick, then quicker still, it all builds to the final act, the shoot-out on the fifth afternoon. Well, not this one. It has marched to the beat of a different drum: super-slow, super-quick, non-existent. Following yesterday’s wash-out, more than half the playing time has already elapsed, and we’ve only had an innings and a bit. The draw is such a hot favourite that if you decide to back it, you’ll have to shell out a tenner for every £3 you stand to win. If you are a betting person, the horse to back is surely New Zealand. Put a fiver on them and you could win £23. The rain, coming on top of Devon Conway’s dream debut, has left Kane Williamson in the driving seat. England, resuming on 111 for 2 and missing all their all-rounders (Stokes, Buttler, Woakes, Curran), could easily be bowled out for 250. That would take about half the day, leaving the other half for the New Zealanders to extend their lead. They could rattle up 200 by noon tomorrow, to hand England a target of about 330 in 80 overs. In a parallel universe, England would race to 450, bowl NZ out for 160, and win by eight wickets. All Joe Root would have to do is make 180 and then grab one of his cheap five-fors. Stranger things have almost happened. Play starts at 11am, as ever – the extra eight overs in the day, if we get them, will be tacked on at the end.

The overall picture is deeply complex and, especially for Conservative MPs, brings mixed news. According to an analysis by Robert Hayward, the elections expert who is also a Tory peer, the new boundaries would have given his party between five and 10 extra seats at the 2019 general election, since most of the new constituencies are in Conservative-friendly areas such as England’s south-east, south-west and east – although Labour-dominated London will get two more.

With many MPs still not in Westminster due to Covid, the information will also be emailed at 3pm. The process was likely to be less tumultuous now the plan to trim 50 seats had been dropped, Hayward said: “Yes, up to a point – but redistribution always is contentious.

He can’t wait to meet people in real life: “If I never have another conversation via Zoom or WhatsApp, I’d be very happy – especially within my love life.” He gave up on dating apps this year, and is looking forward to the return of proper flirtation. “Vibing with someone on an app or a screen is not the same as seeing someone across a room and feeling that excitement in your stomach. That’s what I need right now.”</p> <p>It’s a sentiment echoed by 65-year-old Maggie. After receiving her first Covid vaccine at the end of February, she started spending more time on Hampstead Heath in London with her dog. “I don’t want to have to resort to internet dating, so I’ve just been walking a lot, trying to catch eyes with eligible-looking men,” she says.

There’s a lot that I don’t understand about the gay world. There’s a whole language and ideology I haven’t been initiated into.

Despite that, as soon as she is able she will be leaving London for rural Ghana, for a few months at least. “I’m not sure that I’m 100% OK with having strangers in my physical space yet,” she says. “We’re just coming out of the worst bits of the pandemic and I don’t want someone grinding on me or casually placing their hand on the small of my back – all those old-school flirtatious moves – so I’m removing myself from the equation for a little while longer.”</p> <p>Ohene says that during the period when many of us will be renegotiating our boundaries and personal space we should all get comfortable with “using our words”. Asking before touching should be a standard. “Saying something like, ‘I’d like to get a bit closer to you, do you mind?’” She suggests trying it with friends if it feels awkward: “‘I’d like to hug, let me know if you’re OK with that.’ The stakes are not very high; your friends are not going to reject you, even if they don’t want a hug. But in the club, it’s definitely about checking and being OK with receiving a ‘no’.”</p> <p>Dating via apps and websites have, for years, cushioned many of us from rejection (after all, an unrequited swipe is much less confronting than a real-life “no thank you”) and allowed us to avoid the more negative emotions associated with approaching someone we’re attracted to in real life.</p> <p>“I think as a society we’ve got bad at handling rejection,” says sex educator Ruby Rare. She understands how the impulse to get offline and approach people in a more traditional way will have built up for many people after such an atomised year. “It’ll be interesting to see how people handle these experiences, though. Discomfort and rejection are things you may face if you approach people in real life, but, framed correctly, even these can be good for your self-esteem.” She argues that we should approach people with no expectation that it’ll lead to anything further. “You need to be comfortable with the idea that you’re doing it for yourself; it takes courage to ask someone out, so whatever happens you can be proud that you did it.”</p> <p>***</p> <p>The enforced celibacy of the past year has prompted us to think carefully about what had been missing from our sex lives. Now, after a year or more alone, fantasies have crystallised into desires and, for many, this will be the first opportunity to explore the new facets of their sexual selves.</p> <p>In London, sex parties have never been more popular. In July, Crossbreed, a queer, sex-positive rave, is hosting the launch event for its summer series (named the Summer of Love) at the nightclub Fabric. All 800 tickets sold out in under an hour. In September, <a href=\"https://klubverboten.com/\" title=\"\">Klub Verboten</a> – a once members-only fetish party which now hosts events for non-members too – is hosting its fifth birthday party at a secret location.

Because of lockdown, the couple carried on living together for six months. “So there was no chance of getting back on the dating scene, even if it had been possible.” Since March, he’s been living alone. “I’m desperate to meet new people. I’ve wanted to explore BDSM for a while and now seems like the best opportunity. But I’m aware that even being physically close to a new person will feel like a whole new experience. In one respect I want to throw myself in and just do it, but in another I’m like: ‘How will this actually feel?’”</p> <p>For those who are ready to explore a new aspect of their sexuality, Rare suggests making friends with people with similar interests as a first step. “With sex and dating, the emphasis is often on doing the actual thing,” she says. “But finding the community first, and making friends, can be a less nerve-racking way to start a journey of sexual exploration.”</p> <p>This tactic worked particularly well for Alex Warren, the founder of Crossbreed. “A few years ago, I opened up my relationship with my ex-girlfriend. She went to an orgy and I was really jealous – not because I felt betrayed, but because I wanted to go to an orgy as well. So I just started Googling and found FetLife [a kink- and BDSM-focused social networking website]. I went to a social event and ended up making some amazing friends. I didn’t go to my first sex party until I’d been on the scene for a year or so. By that point I had this really supportive network.” Warren has been a DJ and music producer for more than 10 years and in 2019 decided to bring the two worlds together. “And that’s how Crossbreed came to be.”</p> <p>As he explains: “It’s not really a sex party. It’s just a good rave with designated safe spaces for sex.” Demand has surpassed expectation. “People are desperate to connect, to express themselves physically, to have sex – it’s been a long year.”</p> <p>For many single people, and in particular those who live alone, the past year has been both emotionally numbing and existentially destabilising. “Going months without touching another human being has definitely had an impact on me,” says Maggie, who has lived alone for more than 10 years but has felt more isolated during the pandemic than ever before. She finds herself reminiscing about the crackle of fresh sheets on her wedding night, the feel of a lover’s palm on her thigh. “I am surprised by how much I’ve missed intimacy and how vividly these intimate moments come back to me,” she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ffd3c496a009bf71b354b76aaef1d17d65603ce2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ffd3c496a009bf71b354b76aaef1d17d65603ce2/0_902_2432_2171/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Head shot of couple Jordan Derrien (27) and Rosaline Shahnavaz (30) kissing, May 2021\" width=\"1000\" height=\"893\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jordan, 27, and Rosaline, 30, have been together four months; they met through a mutual friend.

But can it really be compared to the original summer of love and the sexual revolution of the 60s, a moment that prompted a wholesale shift in attitudes towards sex and relationships?</p> <p>There’s one key difference, says Dr Guy Stevenson, a specialist in the 1960s counterculture: the “nihilism of the internet”. He argues that our overexposure to sexual freedom online means there’s no chance of a period of innocent liberation. “Hasn’t the internet made everyone behave as if nothing’s new, particularly in relation to sex?” he says. Thanks to the pill, promiscuity was a new option in the 60s, “whereas now it’s old hat. And the potential to fulfil any sexual fantasy just by going online means we feel like we’ve seen and done it all already.” A year of isolation might have made us horny, but the 1960s hippy revolution, “was characterised by romanticism and a feeling of innocence”, he says. If we are in for a summer of love, he argues, it may well be one marked by cynicism.</p> <p>Hera Cook, writer of <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/tcbh/article-abstract/17/4/589/2948671\" title=\"\">The Long Sexual Revolution: English Women, Sex And Contraception: 1800-1975</a>, agrees that there was an innocence to that period that society has since lost. “There was also free university and a more robust welfare state. And there wasn’t this feeling that the NHS was on the verge of collapse. Basically, attitudes to sex were coming out of a much more hopeful time. In the 60s, people believed things were going to get better and better. Nowadays, with the climate emergency, we all suspect things are going to get worse and worse.”</p> <p>Instead, Cook likens our current situation to the interwar years. “Traditional gender roles were being broken down in that period,” she says. “There was suffrage for women, who’d been working during the first world war. There was a rejection of the heteronormative, masculine warrior ideal as men saw their older counterparts ravaged by the Great War. It was a much more scarred and cynical time, but compared with the 60s – when promiscuity was enabled, but couched in heteronormativity – it was arguably more exciting.</p> <p>“One parallel I can see between now and the 60s is the discussion around consent,” continues Cook. “After the pill, a conversation emerged around men’s feelings of entitlement and women’s right to say no. And it seems to be as relevant today.”</p> <p>Ohene and Rare agree, pointing out that the pandemic has given us all a lesson in consent as we negotiate things like our comfort levels with mask-wearing and distancing. “Before when we talked about consent,” says Rare, “we were always so fixated on sex. And, actually, sexual consent is just one area of our lives where we exercise it. As we’ve seen recently, consent happens all the time, it’s about communicating our feelings and boundaries – right down to how comfortable we are with physically meeting. It’s a dynamic, relational and ongoing conversation.”</p> <p>This, for them, is where the most exciting and fruitful developments within sex and dating lie. “We have the opportunity to approach one another with a lot more compassion and from a more educated starting point,” says Rare. From here, she suggests, we can create a new and better love.</p> <p>***</p> <p>When I catch up with Maggie, she tells me she’s had her second jab and has got a date. “We’ve been set up by mutual friends though, we didn’t meet while dog walking.” Liam has had his first post-lockdown snog – “a walking date that went well”. Georgie’s social life is just getting going again, “and the last time I was in the pub people definitely had their eyes up, and off their phones, which feels promising”. She’s excited about real-world dating, “especially when gigs and festivals start again”.</p> <p>As for me, over the pandemic I dated within the confines of what was legal and morally acceptable. There was a recently divorced dad of two who worked in the City of London. “I’m probably not ready for anything serious,” he said. “But let’s keep in touch, I can take you to Torture Garden [a sex and fetish party] when it’s back on.”<strong> </strong>There was a man who’d recently broken up with someone and moved back to London from Essex. It was the torpor of lockdown in a small town that had broken the relationship, he told me. He planned to replace sex with the gym, but then the gyms closed. “I’ve bought myself a Peloton,” he said, and we never spoke again.</p> <p>I would like to believe that this summer we will take up the tenets of peace, love, unity and consent, and run with them. But I suspect if I fired up the apps again, it would be more of the same. Still, if the pandemic has taught us anything, it is that we are all better when we connect offline. Perhaps now is the right time to take romance out of the equation, put our devices down, hug the people we love, and bask in the glory of their physical presence. I’m excited about a summer of love, not a summer of lovers. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6ebeb56ea5d88f08a0e6a99d9361e23c3b42de65\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ebeb56ea5d88f08a0e6a99d9361e23c3b42de65/0_442_2820_1805/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sean Cole (28) and Sophia Alonge (27) lying on the grass and kissing, May 2021\" width=\"1000\" height=\"640\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: Rosaline Shahnavaz/The Guardian.

Top tips for post-lockdown sex</strong></h2> <p><em>By Ruby Rare</em></p> <p><strong>If it’s been a while since you’ve felt sexy</strong>, think about how to create an environment that delights all of your senses. Remember, arousal involves the whole body, not just your genitals. I suggest starting with solo sex; masturbation is a great way to reconnect with your own pleasure before bringing another person’s into the mix.</p> <p>We’re all out of practice when it comes to physical contact. Rather than trying to cover that up,<strong> embrace the clumsiness</strong>. Body fluids can end up in unexpected places; your teeth may mash together mid-kiss or you might drip sweat into your partner’s eye (true story). Celebrate this in its weird and wonderful glory.</p> <p><strong>Remember </strong><strong>to smile</strong>. Sex is supposed to be fun, so expressing that through your face and body language makes sense. Try putting less emphasis on penetrative sex – especially if that’s not something you’ve done for a while. It’s exciting to see it as one option of many, rather than the default.</p> <p><strong>Embrace rejection</strong>. Don’t let the fear of it stop you approaching someone you fancy in a kind, respectful way. If you’re the person doing the rejecting, keep it short and sweet, and, remember, you don’t owe anyone an explanation as to why you’re saying no. And if you’re ever in a situation where you fear for your safety, get someone else’s attention as soon as possible and ask for support.</p> <p><strong>Keep your post-lockdown expectations realistic</strong>. This isn’t a race, and you don’t need to tick off everything on your sexy bucket list in the first few months. If you’re interested in trying something different, such as a threesome or a new kink, dating apps can be a great way to be upfront about what you want and find other people who are after the same thing.</p> <p><strong>There’s no ‘right’ way to do this</strong>; it’s about finding out what’s right for <em>you</em> and communicating that to those around you. Go at your own pace, and try to appreciate each step as you get back into dating and sex. </p> <p>• Ruby Rare is a sex educator and author of <a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/in/sex-ed-9781526628381/\" title=\"\">Sex Ed: A Guide For Adults</a></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p>","newspaperPageNumber":"25","wordcount":"3252","firstPublicationDate":"2021-06-05T08:00:05Z","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2021-06-05T08:00:05Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2021-06-05T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"The Guardian","shortUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/p/hf26f","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ee8eea715a749c479e1657a206286cb434a3735/0_684_2432_1458/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","sensitive":"true","lang":"en","isLive":"true","bodyText":"The past year has changed 35-year-old Georgie’s outlook on dating. Several disappointing socially distanced dates and limp text exchanges meant she stopped using dating apps at the beginning of 2021. And now her parents have been vaccinated, she feels confident about returning to physical dates, “but not to the apps”, she says. “As things open up, I’m going to lean into spontaneity; I’m going to say yes to every invitation and seize every opportunity. If I feel a connection with someone at a social gathering, a festival or even a bus stop, I’ll go and talk to them. I’m going to be way more carpe fucking diem about it.” Liam, 25, lives in Manchester and has never had a serious relationship. He can’t wait to meet people in real life: “If I never have another conversation via Zoom or WhatsApp, I’d be very happy – especially within my love life.” He gave up on dating apps this year, and is looking forward to the return of proper flirtation. “Vibing with someone on an app or a screen is not the same as seeing someone across a room and feeling that excitement in your stomach. That’s what I need right now.” It’s a sentiment echoed by 65-year-old Maggie. After receiving her first Covid vaccine at the end of February, she started spending more time on Hampstead Heath in London with her dog. “I don’t want to have to resort to internet dating, so I’ve just been walking a lot, trying to catch eyes with eligible-looking men,” she says. By the time of her second dose she hopes to have lined up at least three or four dates. “If this year has taught us anything, it’s that we absolutely must enjoy one another if we can. After everything, how could this not be a summer of love?” In April, as lockdown restrictions began to ease in the UK, the dating app Hinge – one of the fastest growing in the UK – released figures which showed that 85% of users were “open to going on a date as soon as lockdown lifts”. In the week leading up to 12 April, almost half of users had already arranged real-life dates for the moment we were legally allowed to meet outdoors. That month, the parent company of Durex announced a “double digit” increase in condom sales in countries including China, where lockdown restrictions had eased; at the end of May, Superdrug announced a 65% increase in the sale of condoms during the week that pubs and restaurants opened indoors, while Match Group, which owns dating apps including Tinder, predicted a year-on-year increase in revenue of more than 20% as a record number of would-be daters flooded the singles market. But are we ready to date in-person again? To kiss strangers, to flirt, make eye contact, touch? After months of being told to keep our distance, are we ready to get up close and extremely personal – and do we even remember how? *** Dan, 23, from Lincolnshire, came out as gay to friends last year. “But I still haven’t had the conversation with my parents.” The isolation of the past year is what convinced him to be honest about who he is. “The pandemic really drove home how much my friends and family mean to me, which made me think more seriously about my love life.

The casualness of those meetings didn’t diminish the joy or sense of purpose I derived from them. And shutting off this part of my life for the last 12 months has been uncomfortable; each lockdown seemed to remove a layer of optimism about the future. I wonder, though, whether from this emotionally tenderised starting point it might not be easier to connect with others. We’ve all been through something, together.

A ghosting on top of everything else would give your self-esteem such a battering.” She is optimistic about the potential for reform this summer – for returning to a more honest way of connecting with others, away from any algorithm.

There’s a whole language and ideology I haven’t been initiated into.

After a year of isolation, we will all have to become more fluent in the language of consent; more adept at signalling our boundaries and reading the signals from others. Almaz Ohene, a writer and sexual health educator, has missed eye contact and the thrill of another’s physical presence. Despite that, as soon as she is able she will be leaving London for rural Ghana, for a few months at least. “I’m not sure that I’m 100% OK with having strangers in my physical space yet,” she says. “We’re just coming out of the worst bits of the pandemic and I don’t want someone grinding on me or casually placing their hand on the small of my back – all those old-school flirtatious moves – so I’m removing myself from the equation for a little while longer.” Ohene says that during the period when many of us will be renegotiating our boundaries and personal space we should all get comfortable with “using our words”.

I didn’t go to my first sex party until I’d been on the scene for a year or so. By that point I had this really supportive network.” Warren has been a DJ and music producer for more than 10 years and in 2019 decided to bring the two worlds together. “And that’s how Crossbreed came to be.” As he explains: “It’s not really a sex party. It’s just a good rave with designated safe spaces for sex.” Demand has surpassed expectation. “People are desperate to connect, to express themselves physically, to have sex – it’s been a long year.” For many single people, and in particular those who live alone, the past year has been both emotionally numbing and existentially destabilising. “Going months without touching another human being has definitely had an impact on me,” says Maggie, who has lived alone for more than 10 years but has felt more isolated during the pandemic than ever before. She finds herself reminiscing about the crackle of fresh sheets on her wedding night, the feel of a lover’s palm on her thigh. “I am surprised by how much I’ve missed intimacy and how vividly these intimate moments come back to me,” she says. Undoubtedly, summer 2021 will be coloured by the pent-up frustrations of people who have been forced to keep their dating lives, and their sexual selves, on the proverbial shelf for a year or more. But can it really be compared to the original summer of love and the sexual revolution of the 60s, a moment that prompted a wholesale shift in attitudes towards sex and relationships? There’s one key difference, says Dr Guy Stevenson, a specialist in the 1960s counterculture: the “nihilism of the internet”. He argues that our overexposure to sexual freedom online means there’s no chance of a period of innocent liberation. “Hasn’t the internet made everyone behave as if nothing’s new, particularly in relation to sex?” he says. Thanks to the pill, promiscuity was a new option in the 60s, “whereas now it’s old hat. And the potential to fulfil any sexual fantasy just by going online means we feel like we’ve seen and done it all already.” A year of isolation might have made us horny, but the 1960s hippy revolution, “was characterised by romanticism and a feeling of innocence”, he says. If we are in for a summer of love, he argues, it may well be one marked by cynicism. Hera Cook, writer of The Long Sexual Revolution: English Women, Sex And Contraception: 1800-1975, agrees that there was an innocence to that period that society has since lost. “There was also free university and a more robust welfare state. And there wasn’t this feeling that the NHS was on the verge of collapse. Basically, attitudes to sex were coming out of a much more hopeful time. In the 60s, people believed things were going to get better and better. Nowadays, with the climate emergency, we all suspect things are going to get worse and worse.” Instead, Cook likens our current situation to the interwar years. “Traditional gender roles were being broken down in that period,” she says. “There was suffrage for women, who’d been working during the first world war. There was a rejection of the heteronormative, masculine warrior ideal as men saw their older counterparts ravaged by the Great War. It was a much more scarred and cynical time, but compared with the 60s – when promiscuity was enabled, but couched in heteronormativity – it was arguably more exciting. “One parallel I can see between now and the 60s is the discussion around consent,” continues Cook. “After the pill, a conversation emerged around men’s feelings of entitlement and women’s right to say no. And it seems to be as relevant today.” Ohene and Rare agree, pointing out that the pandemic has given us all a lesson in consent as we negotiate things like our comfort levels with mask-wearing and distancing. “Before when we talked about consent,” says Rare, “we were always so fixated on sex. And, actually, sexual consent is just one area of our lives where we exercise it. As we’ve seen recently, consent happens all the time, it’s about communicating our feelings and boundaries – right down to how comfortable we are with physically meeting. It’s a dynamic, relational and ongoing conversation.” This, for them, is where the most exciting and fruitful developments within sex and dating lie. “We have the opportunity to approach one another with a lot more compassion and from a more educated starting point,” says Rare. From here, she suggests, we can create a new and better love. *** When I catch up with Maggie, she tells me she’s had her second jab and has got a date. “We’ve been set up by mutual friends though, we didn’t meet while dog walking.” Liam has had his first post-lockdown snog – “a walking date that went well”. Georgie’s social life is just getting going again, “and the last time I was in the pub people definitely had their eyes up, and off their phones, which feels promising”. She’s excited about real-world dating, “especially when gigs and festivals start again”. As for me, over the pandemic I dated within the confines of what was legal and morally acceptable. There was a recently divorced dad of two who worked in the City of London. “I’m probably not ready for anything serious,” he said. “But let’s keep in touch, I can take you to Torture Garden [a sex and fetish party] when it’s back on.” There was a man who’d recently broken up with someone and moved back to London from Essex. It was the torpor of lockdown in a small town that had broken the relationship, he told me. He planned to replace sex with the gym, but then the gyms closed. “I’ve bought myself a Peloton,” he said, and we never spoke again. I would like to believe that this summer we will take up the tenets of peace, love, unity and consent, and run with them. But I suspect if I fired up the apps again, it would be more of the same. Still, if the pandemic has taught us anything, it is that we are all better when we connect offline. Perhaps now is the right time to take romance out of the equation, put our devices down, hug the people we love, and bask in the glory of their physical presence. I’m excited about a summer of love, not a summer of lovers. Let’s get it on, again! Top tips for post-lockdown sex By Ruby Rare If it’s been a while since you’ve felt sexy, think about how to create an environment that delights all of your senses. Remember, arousal involves the whole body, not just your genitals. I suggest starting with solo sex; masturbation is a great way to reconnect with your own pleasure before bringing another person’s into the mix. We’re all out of practice when it comes to physical contact. Rather than trying to cover that up, embrace the clumsiness. Body fluids can end up in unexpected places; your teeth may mash together mid-kiss or you might drip sweat into your partner’s eye (true story). Celebrate this in its weird and wonderful glory. Remember to smile. Sex is supposed to be fun, so expressing that through your face and body language makes sense. Try putting less emphasis on penetrative sex – especially if that’s not something you’ve done for a while. It’s exciting to see it as one option of many, rather than the default. Embrace rejection. Don’t let the fear of it stop you approaching someone you fancy in a kind, respectful way. If you’re the person doing the rejecting, keep it short and sweet, and, remember, you don’t owe anyone an explanation as to why you’re saying no. And if you’re ever in a situation where you fear for your safety, get someone else’s attention as soon as possible and ask for support. Keep your post-lockdown expectations realistic. This isn’t a race, and you don’t need to tick off everything on your sexy bucket list in the first few months. If you’re interested in trying something different, such as a threesome or a new kink, dating apps can be a great way to be upfront about what you want and find other people who are after the same thing. There’s no ‘right’ way to do this; it’s about finding out what’s right for you and communicating that to those around you. Go at your own pace, and try to appreciate each step as you get back into dating and sex. • Ruby Rare is a sex educator and author of Sex Ed: A Guide For Adults","charCount":"18433","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/alexandra-jones\">Alexandra Jones</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"books/2021/jun/05/sorrow-and-bliss-by-meg-mason-review-tender-huge-hearted-comedy","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-05T08:00:05Z","webTitle":"Sorrow and Bliss by Meg Mason review – tender, huge-hearted comedy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/jun/05/sorrow-and-bliss-by-meg-mason-review-tender-huge-hearted-comedy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2021/jun/05/sorrow-and-bliss-by-meg-mason-review-tender-huge-hearted-comedy","fields":{"headline":"Sorrow and Bliss by Meg Mason review – tender, huge-hearted comedy","standfirst":"<p>This moving novel about mental illness and sisterly love finds hilarity and wisdom in anguish, without ever diminishing pain</p>","trailText":"This moving novel about mental illness and sisterly love finds hilarity and wisdom in anguish, without ever diminishing pain","byline":"Clare Clark","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a45630a7620e51dad019b77cdccae66698c86f0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a45630a7620e51dad019b77cdccae66698c86f0/175_110_3215_1928/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Meg Mason makes us care for a character who does unforgivable things.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Meg Mason makes us care for a character who does unforgivable things.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Grant Sparkes-Carroll</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>In her poem <a href=\"https://theprogressofspring.tumblr.com/post/164259406697/tango-by-louise-gl%C3%BCck-1-on-evenings-like-this\">“Tango”</a>, 2020’s Nobel laureate Louise Glück concludes that “Of two sisters, one is always the watcher, one the dancer”.

(On that subject, Police Academy is <em>way</em> racier than my memories of Mahoney suggested.) My children, naturally, loved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/nov/21/michael-j-fox-every-step-now-is-a-frigging-math-problem-so-i-take-it-slow\" title=\"\">Marty McFly</a> (they didn’t fall <em>that</em> far from the tree) and they grasped the concept of time travel. But something else threw them. It’s in the scene when Marty’s in the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-rihCFNsqQ\" title=\"\">diner in 1955</a> … what is that weird box he’s walking into?</p> <p>“That’s a phone box. It’s what people used to make calls in before they had mobiles,” I said. They stared at me, as if I spoke of a time before people had oxygen (which doesn’t say great things about how much they see me with my phone, but let’s ignore that). It got worse: what is that book Marty’s looking in?</p> <p>“That’s a phone book. It’s how people found out other people’s numbers,” I said, suddenly understanding how my grandfather felt that time he told me about growing up without indoor plumbing.</p> <p>Now, let’s take this apart. Back To The Future is about a teenager who travels back in time 30 years. Sure, people in 1955 don’t know about diet sodas, or padded jackets, or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0XiztFUZlc\" title=\"\">reruns</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1i5coU-0_Q\" title=\"\">Chuck Berry songs don’t exist yet</a>. But, overall, the world in 1955 is recognisable to a kid from 1985. He knows what a phone box and phone book are, for a start.</p> <p>To kids born in 2015, however, as my twins were, both worlds are completely baffling. Why look up someone’s phone number in a book instead of on the phone itself? (Thank heavens Marty didn’t then use a phone card, surely the most baffling phone-accessory-from-the-past of all.)

But the changes over the past 40 years, not just in our daily lives but in how we think, have been so vast and fast that the past is another solar system. This explains the rise of micro-generations, such as the latest one, dubbed “<a href=\"https://index.medium.com/why-the-hybrid-workforce-of-the-future-depends-on-the-geriatric-millennial-6f9ff4de1d23\" title=\"\">geriatric millennials</a>”, referring to anyone born between 1980 and 1985, meaning those who remember life pre-Facebook, but not pre-Myspace.

When two people decide to have a baby, they engage in an act of production.” So begins Andrew Solomon’s brilliant book Far From The Tree, about parents learning to accept their children’s differences, which I read during my first pregnancy. I get it, I thought. Parents shouldn’t narcissistically expect their children to be the same as them. But just because my kids aren’t the same as me, that doesn’t mean they shouldn’t be forced to have exactly the same childhood as me. My parents very much did not make me watch Howdy Doody, or whatever shows they grew up with, but while other modern children are raised on CBeebies and Paw Patrol, mine get 1980s TV shows and movies poured down their gullets. This allows them to enjoy wholesome classics such as Dogtanian and The Princess Bride, and allows me to relive my peak years. Everybody wins! Except, possibly, my children, who, on seeing a little boy dressed as Harry Potter on Halloween, asked if he was the witch in The Wizard Of Oz. They’re like the Amish kid in Witness, bemused by the modern world. But they’re also bemused by the past. I expected to have to explain some things to them, mainly from the American shows – Mister Rogers, Reading Rainbow – that I have merrily forced on them. You know, educating them in the exotic linguistic differences: “zee” for “zed” and so on. But I didn’t anticipate that I would be explaining actual ancient history. This started when we watched Back To The Future, which is one of those rare 1980s films I watched as a kid that is just about suitable for kids. (On that subject, Police Academy is way racier than my memories of Mahoney suggested.) My children, naturally, loved Marty McFly (they didn’t fall that far from the tree) and they grasped the concept of time travel. But something else threw them. It’s in the scene when Marty’s in the diner in 1955 … what is that weird box he’s walking into? “That’s a phone box. It’s what people used to make calls in before they had mobiles,” I said. They stared at me, as if I spoke of a time before people had oxygen (which doesn’t say great things about how much they see me with my phone, but let’s ignore that). It got worse: what is that book Marty’s looking in? “That’s a phone book. It’s how people found out other people’s numbers,” I said, suddenly understanding how my grandfather felt that time he told me about growing up without indoor plumbing. Now, let’s take this apart. Back To The Future is about a teenager who travels back in time 30 years. Sure, people in 1955 don’t know about diet sodas, or padded jackets, or reruns, and Chuck Berry songs don’t exist yet. But, overall, the world in 1955 is recognisable to a kid from 1985. He knows what a phone box and phone book are, for a start. To kids born in 2015, however, as my twins were, both worlds are completely baffling. Why look up someone’s phone number in a book instead of on the phone itself? (Thank heavens Marty didn’t then use a phone card, surely the most baffling phone-accessory-from-the-past of all.) It’s the same thing with Sesame Street (if Bert can’t find Ernie, why doesn’t he just call him?); with The Muppet Show (why can’t Kermit just ask Google where he could find a new theatre?); with The Karate Kid (why doesn’t Daniel just take an Uber instead of always riding his bike?). Times change, technology changes: this has always been a source of comedy for time-travel movies (although Bill And Ted’s Excellent Adventure dates itself now, given Bill and Ted travel in a bloody phone box). But the changes over the past 40 years, not just in our daily lives but in how we think, have been so vast and fast that the past is another solar system. This explains the rise of micro-generations, such as the latest one, dubbed “geriatric millennials”, referring to anyone born between 1980 and 1985, meaning those who remember life pre-Facebook, but not pre-Myspace. I’m even more geriatric and am a “xennial”, between generation X and (geriatric) millennials, which is defined as “neither as disaffected as gen X-ers nor as optimistic as millennials”, or, as I define it, “a little too obsessed with My So-Called Life”. Mainly, this is down to the rise of the internet and mobile phones, both of which have obliterated things kids in particular relied on for decades, from Encyclopedia Britannicas to actual phone calls, which have been replaced by likes and emojis.

Thanks for reading! Global credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poor’s has lifted its outlook on Australia’s economy, indicating the country’s top-tier AAA rating is safe. AAP has the story: S&amp;P said the improved outlook reflects its expectations that government budget deficits will narrow in line with its forecasts. “We expect the budget to be supported by steady revenue growth, aided by robust commodity prices and expenditure restraint,” the agency said on Monday. “We believe Australia’s external accounts are likely to remain stronger than in the past and be resilient during potential crises.” It said Australia has a strong track record of managing major economic shocks, moderating the agency’s concern over the nation’s high level of external and household debt. The Northern Territory is expanding the age range for vaccinations, allowing all over 16s to get the jab. The NT becomes the first jurisdiction to offer the vaccine to almost everyone, and makes the vaccine available to another 60,000 people there. The chief minister, Michael Gunner, said it was a “sensible” decision to take: This is a sensible decision, based on our indigeneity, mobility and vulnerability. When you consider not just the make-up of the Darwin population but how people move in and out of Darwin it makes sense to treat us as you would a remote vaccination centre. This decision will also breed vaccine confidence – the more people you know, who you work and play with, will have the vax.” So the discussions around Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk’s vaccination this morning have continued, with a many questioning both the reason given (to go to the Olympics?) and the choice of vaccine: For what it’s worth, the premier defended getting the Pfizer vaccine, saying it was so she could get her second dose...before the Tokyo Olympics. “There may be a requirement for the state to present to the whole (International) Olympics Committee about the Olympics, and I wouldn’t have been unvaccinated and that’s why I had the Pfizer,” Palaszczuk told reporters. I, for one, would also like a vaccine and a trip to the Olympics. OK, so here’s what we learned at today’s press conference: 11 new cases reported today, including three children, two aged care workers, a resident at said facility, and a new case in West Melbourne. No fresh announcements on the extent or timing of the Melbourne lockdown. The Victorian government announced a $30m support package for the state, with a focus on emergency relief. The new case in West Melbourne means there is an increase in the list of exposure sites and close contacts. The health minister welcomed the additional vaccine doses allocated by the commonwealth. Not quite as terrible as early reports suggested. It was good to get the context on those numbers and cases. And now Foley is asked about the impacts lockdowns are having on the mental health of children: We know that mental health system in the country, let alone the state, has been under huge challenge before the pandemic. That’s why we called a royal commission. We saw during the course of, right across the country, the reports of how presentations, particularly for young people, whether they be community or acute services, had gone up. That’s why the royal commission’s recommendations that were adopted by the Victorian government specifically fund and commit to arrangements to address precisely that issue, and that’s why when it comes to the work that all the states put to national cabinet last Friday, on hospital demand, one of the biggest areas of increased demand right across the country, the Ambulance Victoria, ambulance callouts, presentations and emergency departments and presentations at community settings is mental health challenges and particularly issues for young people with mental health, this is a national crisis in our system, we welcome the royal commission’s recommendations, we welcome the work done by all the national health commissioner. Will the vaccine age limit be dropped any time soon? Testing commander Jeroen Weimar had this to say: We will drop the age when we start to see demand soften. I think, from the numbers in my head at the moment ... around one in five Victorians aged 40 to 49 have had their first dose. We will start the second dose in a week or two, and I want to make sure we can get them completed as fast as we can. We’ve done around just over 36% of Victorians aged 50 to 69. We are part of a national program and the rollout was set up really around those high-risk occupations first – we have a good record – and then vulnerability, age-based, work your way down, knowing those older are more vulnerable than those younger. We are not going to keep shifting around in this program, this is now a thing Victorians understand. Forty and above, you can get vaccinated. If you are Aboriginal and Torres straight Islander over 16, you can get vaccinated. Certain medical conditions, you can get vaccinated. Critical workforces, you can get vaccinated. Ben Roberts-Smith’s defamation trial has opened in Sydney. His barrister Bruce McClintock has begun by describing the Victoria Cross recipient’s skill as a soldier, saying: This is a case of courage, devotion to duty, self-sacrifice and – perhaps most important of all – surpassing skill in soldiering, on one hand. On the other hand, it’s a case about dishonest journalism, corrosive jealousy, cowardice and lies … led by bitter people, jealous of [Roberts-Smith’s] courage and success, aided by credulous journalists. McClintock emphasised to Justice Anthony Besanko: “War is violent”, and that soldiers are required, at times, to “kill the enemy”. He said Roberts-Smith’s detractors have “forgotten the violence of war in their rush to tear him down”. McClintock quoted Winston Churchill: We sleep soundly in our beds because rough men stand ready in the night to visit violence on those who would do us harm. The soldier himself is in the courtroom, supported by his parents. He is expected to give evidence later this week. Roberts-Smith, 42, is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times for defamation over a series of reports published in 2018 which he alleges are defamatory because they portray him as someone who “broke the moral and legal rules of military engagement” and committed war crimes including murder. The court heard on Monday that the newspapers allege Roberts-Smith committed six murders, on five separate occasions, while deployed to Afghanistan as a member of the SAS regiment. He is also accused of bullying fellow soldiers and committing domestic violence. Roberts-Smith, 42, has consistently denied the allegations, saying they are “false”, “baseless” and “completely without any foundation in truth”. Testing commander Jeroen Weimar is now asked about concerns (??) about stockpiling vaccines in the state. He explains it was a “flow process”, that all vaccines received are flowing into people’s arms. When vaccine arrives our depots, into our hubs, we have to go through a process of disturbing it to over 48 of our clinics. We also have some clinics, that has to go through a process of pharmacists who have to make up the vaccine into the doses – that takes time. Vaccine doses that arrived yesterday from the commonwealth, which I’m very grateful for, takes me at least a week to convert into a viable product they can hand out to people. We will do over 150-or-160,000 doses in the week ahead. The stock we have at the moment is about right for the scale [of the] program we’re running, so we don’t run out at some local centres. It was great we got some additional uplift of supply from our colleagues in the commonwealth last week. That was great. We have a temporary bump up in our numbers. It will also go through into the clinics in the next week or so and into arms in the following week. There is no concern at all about our work. An interesting interaction now, with Sutton asked if the outbreak stems from diplomats who are allowed to quarantine at home. He says: We simply don’t know. Wouldn’t rule anything in or out. We are obviously checking against everyone who is tested, and diplomats should be tested as well. But without a match we can’t say. Sutton is then asked if he has the figures for how many people are exempt from quarantine, and says he doesn’t but they are “in the tens”. Sutton was also asked about the PM’s nudge of Victoria to end its lockdown as soon as possible, and said no state had handled similar outbreaks to Victoria: Outbreaks previously across the country have either been single cases who have had some community exposures – we have seen circuit-breaker lockdowns, it is not as though they haven’t occurred, they have occurred a couple of times in Perth, a couple of times in Brisbane, with single cases or just a couple of cases. And previous outbreaks in Victoria had been handled without lockdowns; they were handled through contact tracing, and the Black Rock outbreak as an example of that. We are dealing with a variants of concern. I don’t want to say it is some order of magnitude more dangerous. But 75% of people within households becoming positive when there is a case, there is a challenge. Chief health officer Brett Sutton was asked if he was concerned that a number of the new cases came after a day-13 test. He said: I don’t think it is a concern. We have thousands of primary close contacts, they will all go through that early testing. If they are identified as cases, they going into isolation for the 10 days. But they will always get an ‘exit test’, if you like – day 13 is the need there. A number of those don’t have any symptoms, and [were] picked up on the day-13 tests. They were picked up on day seven – they might have tested positive earlier but the fact that every single one of them needs to have a confirmed day-13 test before they are released from quarantine is a standard precaution, to be absolutely sure. And there will be a number who only get picked up on that test. Testing commander Jeroen Weimar has given some further details on the new case who worked as a cleaner at a construction site. Weimar said the person was known to authorities, having been a close contact, and it meant there were a few more exposure sites the individual travelled to, including taking a train trip. We have over 490 primary close contacts, and over 400 have returned a negative test results – an encouraging step forward. There are a few more to chase down. The immediate work colleagues of the cleaners have all returned negative test results but we will continue to drive hard on [testing]. The minister for disability, ageing and carers, Luke Donnellan, has announced the state government has put together a $30m support package for the state, to make sure “no one will be left behind” and that everyone has access to emergency and hardship payments. So far, that includes $4.5m for that emergency relief, as well as $12m for culturally and linguistically diverse communities, $5m for emergency food relief and $7m to bolster communication, case management and service access. Health minister Martin Foley has addressed the state’s increased allocation of vaccines, saying Victoria had been “eating into our supplies”: We welcome the federal government’s allocations announced yesterday, particularly when it comes to doubling the supply for the next few weeks of AstraZeneca for our GPs. That is most welcome. We have in fact been eating into our supplies. And having demonstrated that, I was pleased with the commonwealth providing Victoria extra doses beyond our allocated standard numbers. Health minister Martin Foley has given further context to the 11 cases reported today, which include three children and an adult, another staff member at the Arcare aged care facility (in addition to the resident and staff member reported yesterday, but included in today’s numbers) and four household contacts of the Whittlesea outbreak. The final numbers include a new case in Port Melbourne: a construction worker who has been previously identified. The Victorian press conference has begun. There is no clash between ABC management and Four Corners over the QAnon story, Senate estimates has been told. An upcoming episode examining the relationship between the prime minister, Scott Morrison, and a supporter of the QAnon conspiracy theory was delayed for review last week. ABC managing director David Anderson said he respected Four Corners and stood by its journalism, despite his decision as editor-in-chief to delay the QAnon story. He said: I do have absolute faith and the utmost respect for the 4C team... it is not unreasonable for me to question certain things. News Corp reported on Monday that Four Corners was at war with management. Anderson said no one in government or the Liberal party had contacted the ABC and demanded the story not be aired and that the ABC board had not been consulted over the issue. However, he confirmed that an adviser for Morrison had contacted ABC news chief Gaven Morris about the story. Anderson said: I do not believe there has been an intervention by the government or anyone else that the program should not go to air. We are on standby for the Victorian press conference, thankfully no crossover today, but I wonder if we’ll hear any reaction to Scott Morrison essentially putting some pressure on the state government to lift lockdown “as soon as possible”. Finally, the PM was also asked his thoughts on the Queensland premier getting the Pfizer jab so she could go to the Olympics. He says: I have no plans to go to those Olympics. I’ll be looking forward to seeing the Japanese prime minister next weekend – this weekend coming, I should say – at the G7. Can you imagine having gone through all those preparations and then having the world struck by a pandemic? That I know was quite heartbreaking for the people of Japan and so we wish them all the best as they persevere and put these Games on. Next up, Morrison was asked if the lockdown in Victoria should be extended. He says: That would ultimately be a decision for the Victorian government, as it always is. The commonwealth will determine its position through the chief medical officer. We are seeing the cases that are identified, occurring in quarantining, and whether they are presenting in other areas, a contained situation. Here in Australia, we are living in a way with this virus like few if any other countries other than New Zealand are in the world. And this is a challenging lockdown but it’s one that will be overcome and it will be one that I hope will see Victoria opened again soon, particularly for those parents who are having to keep the kids at home away from school. Kids have lost enough time out of school over the course of the last 18 months. It’s very important we get those kids to school as soon as possible. I am hopeful that these restrictions in Victoria will be lifted as soon as possible. As the premier herself said when similar circumstances were faced here, in New South Wales, the restrictions were contained to a very specific part of Sydney, so I would be urging that we move towards lifting those restrictions as soon as possible. We will be in a position tomorrow for Victorians affected to go online and make those applications for the payments, and there will be further updates provided by the minister for Services Australia later today to confirm those arrangements. So, with the PM slightly smirking behind her, Berejiklian has kind of clarified her call on the government to build and run its own quarantine facility in New South Wales, saying it was because NSW was at “capacity”. The point I was making is we are at our operational capacity. So if there was any proposal in the future, it wouldn’t come from us because we are at stretch point now. The expert advice is, New South Wales, once you get over 5,000, and sometimes 5,500 at any one time, when you creep up over that you are at a very high risk point. The point I made was we certainly wouldn’t be putting on a request to operate any additional facility because we don’t have the capacity, we are at capacity now. As the prime minister said, down the track, quarantine could look different once the majority of our population is vaccinated and international borders are open. That is a different question but at this point in time, we don’t have capacity, that’s the point I was making. I post the following with zero comment: Prime minister Scott Morrison and NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian have announced they are combining forces to fund a $500m bypass over the Hawkesbury River to solve “traffic issues.” From what I’ve understood, this will be a new bridge over the river, to relieve the “choke point” at the Richmond bridge. This, by the way, was the same bridge that flooded during the one-in-100-year rain event earlier this year. So, apparently the PM and the NSW premier are set to make a major infrastructure announcement at any time now. It looks like we’re going to have presser crossover. Excellent Monday morning. I want to go back to Gladys Berejiklian’s time on 2GB this morning, where she also piled pressure on to the federal government to find alternatives to hotel quarantine. She repeated her calls for the government to build and run its own dedicated quarantine hubs in NSW. We don’t know how long the pandemic is going to be with us and I just say to the feds 5,000 [people in quarantine] is all we can do in NSW at any one time. We need to think about when the vast majority of our population is vaccinated, international travel resumes, presumably quarantine will look a bit different to what it is now. The feds do have to consider what that means for the future of facilities. If they want extra capacity in NSW, they’re going to have to build and run it themselves. We’re not in the business of operating a federally-built quarantine facility The premier also said hotels couldn’t be used forever, especially if international borders opened again. In the meantime, New South Wales has recorded zero locally acquired cases today, but is reporting five cases in overseas travellers: Also of note is that in the week ending Sunday 6 June NSW delivered more than 80,000 vaccines, including more than 33,000 jabs administered at the Sydney Olympic Park vaccination centre. NSW has now administered just under 1.5 million vaccines in total, with nearly a million of those coming from the GP network. I’m hearing that the PM will be stepping up for a presser alongside NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian in the next half hour, which should be fun, but also I hope it doesn’t overlap with the Victorian presser. Please line them up, guys, please. ABC MD David Anderson has contradicted Christian Porter’s claims last week that the ABC is “humiliated”, that it had “backed down” and that it regretted the article the ABC published. The former attorney general gave a bullish press conference outside court last week in which he said the ABC had been “forced to say they regret the outcome of the reporting”. He said: They have been forced by my taking this action all the way to the court door, they have been forced to say they regret the article.. I never thought that they would concede that the accusations that were put in the article could never be proven. But Anderson told a Senate estimates hearing that the ABC was not humiliated and “did not regret the article”. All that had happened was an editor’s note had been attached to the article. Anderson said: The editor’s note said that both parties accept that some readers misinterpreted the article as an accusation of guilt against Mr Porter and that reading, not intended, was regretted. Senator, again I’ll just suggest that the editor’s note was agreed by both parties, and was affixed to the online article as [of] that Monday. Anderson stopped short of agreeing with a suggestion that what Porter said outside court was “nonsense”. Finally, the Victorian Department of Health has given *some* context, after dropping the numbers this morning without any explanation: This appears to be good news, but many people on Twitter are pointing out the needless anxiety that comes with just plonking numbers onto social media without an explanation, and without a time for the press conference. We are still waiting on the confirmation of the time for that presser as well. So, Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has had her first dose of the Covid vaccine, and marked the occasion with a characteristic tweet and video: But there are some elements to this that need a second look. According to the premier, she got the Pfizer jab because... she has to go to the Olympics? Why does she need to go to the Olympics? I mean sure, perhaps to push for the 2032 Brisbane bid, but couldn’t it be a Zoom call? And also, with all the consternation around the AstraZeneca v Pfizer jab, it is interesting she has gotten the latter. Questions abound. Ben Roberts-Smith has arrived in court for the first day of his defamation hearing against three newspapers over their reporting of war crimes allegations against him. The Victoria Cross recipient walked into court alone, wearing a suit, and did not speak to waiting media, but greeted a well-wisher with a brief “thanks mate”. His mother, Sue, and father, Len, a judge and major general in the Australian army, hugged him in court when they arrived and took up seats behind him. Roberts-Smith will be the first person to give evidence in the case. He is expected to take the stand later this week. Roberts-Smith, 42, is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times for defamation over a series of reports published in 2018 which he alleges are defamatory because they portray him as someone who “broke the moral and legal rules of military engagement” and committed war crimes including murder. Roberts-Smith, 42, has consistently denied the allegations, saying they were “false”, “baseless” and “completely without any foundation in truth”. ABC managing director David Anderson is defending the broadcaster’s social media policy, after telling senators that Four Corners executive producer Sally Neighbour won’t be disciplined for an inaccurate tweet about Porter dropping his defamation action. Anderson said Neighbour’s tweet was inaccurate and he had contacted news chief Gaven Morris to tell him to contact her immediately and get her to take it down. Neighbour deleted it and followed up with an accurate tweet. Liberal senator Sarah Henderson asked him why the ABC didn’t follow the BBC’s lead and simply ban journalists from tweeting about certain subjects. Anderson said ABC staff were required to act in a certain way and the guidelines were “sophisticated and enforceable”. The ABC has also confirmed that a story published in the Australian last week saying the ABC had apologised to the judge for Neighbour’s tweet was incorrect. In completely normal Sydney news, Domain is reporting a house with no kitchen and no toilet in the south-east has sold for $4.07m at an auction this weekend. That’s right, no kitchen and no toilet. Over $4 million. Described as “uninhabitable”. The house in Kensington also has no power or water connected and a leaking roof. But that didn’t put off bidders. For some comparison, the previous owners bought the home for $1.1m in 2005. There were 1048 (!!) auctions in Sydney at the weekend, with 770 results reported. Which feels crazy. The National Australia Bank is facing an investigation after allegations of potentially serious and ongoing non-compliance with anti-money laundering laws were made in a letter from the industry watchdog, Austrac. In its letter to NAB, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre outlined serious concerns about the bank’s customer identification procedures, ongoing customer due diligence, and compliance with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws. Austrac’s enforcement team is now taking a look at the matter and will determine if any further action is required. Austrac has a wide range of enforcement options available to it, including civil penalty orders, enforceable undertakings, infringement notices and remedial directions. Speaking to the SMH, NAB boss Ross McEwan said it would cooperate with the investigation. We are very aware that we need to further improve our performance in relation to these matters. We have been working to improve and clearly have more to do. It is a key priority for everyone at NAB to uplift our financial crime capabilities, minimise risk to customers and the bank, and improve operational performance. That’s why we are so focused on getting the basics right every time to protect our customers and our bank. Queensland reports no news Covid cases The ABC will pay $100,000 in mediation costs to Christian Porter’s legal firm, ABC managing director David Anderson has told parliament. Under the agreement between the ABC and Porter, the ABC was given permission to tell the Senate details of the otherwise confidential agreement. So there’s a fair amount of anxiety making the rounds about today’s Covid numbers, especially since Melbourne is supposedly due to emerge from lockdown on Thursday. We’re still waiting on confirmation for when the press conference will be to hear what authorities have to say, but I thought Josh Taylor made a good point here: So, and this is speculation, but it is possible these numbers are just a ripple effect from the initial outbreak. But we will see. ABC managing director David Anderson was up at Senate estimates at 9am this morning after he was recalled to be questioned about the end of the Christian Porter defamation suit, which the former attorney general dropped last week. The MD is expected to be grilled about the details of the confidential agreement with Porter after the Australian reported that Porter would receive “a sum in the vicinity of $100,000 from the ABC” – a claim the ABC denies. A spokesperson said: The ABC has not and will not pay any amount to Mr Porter. ABC managing director David Anderson has been asked to appear before the Senate estimates committee on Monday 7 June and will have the opportunity to respond to a range of issues. The original reporting on this matter remains unaltered on the public record and we stand by our journalists and the work they do in the public interest. Our staff are aware of their responsibilities under the ABC’s ‘personal use of social media’ guidelines and the processes in place to ensure compliance with those guidelines. We are also expecting some questions about the ABC’s social media policy. Victoria is reporting 11 new coronavirus cases in the 24 hours to midnight last night. But the good news is that more than 17,000 vaccine dose were administered, and more than 24,000 tests taken. The two cases announced yesterday – a nurse and a resident at an aged care facility – are also included in those numbers. We’re still waiting for today today’s Covid numbers out of Victoria, but since we’re previewing what’s coming up, I thought I’d also add that ABC boss David Anderson will be quizzed in estimates today, which should be interesting in light of his decision to delay the airing of a Four Corners episode that looked at the PM’s ties to a a QAnon conspiracy theorist. Deputy PM Michael McCormak, looking absolutely freezing this morning, received his own jab today, and indicated that he thought some vaccine complacency had come with Australia’s “strong” response to the pandemic. It is a worldwide effort to combat this insidious virus but Australia has done very well when you consider America. We have had one death this year. We have done very well and that has led to a level of complacency across the community. I will get the jab and I will get it whenever. I say to Australians make sure you do. Don’t wait. Get the jab when you’re eligible to do so and do it for yourself and for your community. More (ex) politicians on morning shows! This time, it’s former PM Malcolm Turnbull on RN Breakfast throwing his support behind vaccine passports, both domestic and international. Turnbull said the idea was sound and that vaccine hesitancy needed to be addressed. I know people will say this is tough, this is non-libertarian. [But] we need to be able to have good records so people can authoritatively and accurately say whether or not they have been vaccinated. Australians have to be tough about this and make it very clear that there are some things you will not be able to do if you are not vaccinated. Similar to no jab, no play. But if you want to work in healthcare, if you want to work in aged care [and] if you want to get on an airplane, if you want to go to a cinema, we are entitled to say you can’t do it to protect the rest of the community. A virus can spread at the speed of a jet airplane. So we cannot treat this as just a one-in-100-year event. We’ve got to make sure we we don’t waste this crisis. So just on those Newspoll results, I thought I’d give it a bit of a rundown as we head into the rest of the day. So the Coalition drew level with Labor on a two-party preferred basis for the first time in months, leaving them at 50-50. Support for the Coalition rose from 49% in May, with the last time the parties deadlocked being in February. On a primary vote basis, however, the Coalition still leads Labor 41-36. Backing for the Greens dropped a percentage point to 11, while One Nation’s primary vote rose from 2 to 3%. PM Scott Morrison’s numbers dropped pretty sharply, from 58% in mid-May to 54%, but Labor’s Anthony Albanese’s approval rating also dropped from 39% to 38%. And in terms of who would make a better prime minister, Morrison maintains his lead over Albanese, with 53% backing Morrison compared to 32% for Albanese. Sticking with politicians on morning shows, senator Jacquie Lambie was on the Today Show saying the latest Newspoll results should give the PM a jolt. If this hasn’t been a kick up the backside, I don’t know how else to get him to better manage Covid. He needs to stop saying it is the states or the premier down here or whatever. Start taking responsibility for your lack of actions. I just don’t think he has been on top of his game since he got in. Covid has knocked him around. I don’t think he has handled it as well as what he probably could have. It of course comes after the PM’s approval rating dropped from 58 % to 54 %, according to the poll. NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian was on the radio this morning saying NSW should receive a “fair share of the vaccine” after federal health minister Greg Hunt yesterday announced Victoria will be receiving an extra 330,000 vaccines. Speaking on 2GB, Berejiklian said the outbreak in Victoria looked under control and it was only fair NSW received it’s “fair share”. Anything we can do to help we should, [but] I think fair is fair and we should just receive based on the size of every state. We are taking in lots of bodies every week through the airport and we do it because it’s the right thing to do. We have a lot on our shoulders as well. I think it’s only fair that we get our fair share of the vaccine. NSW has had similar if not larger outbreaks and we’ve dealt with things as we’ve seen fit. I just think moving forward we just have to offer states an incentive for doing the right thing, offer states an incentive for getting on top of things and I hope that’s the way things happen in the future. Straight out of the gates this morning (or lingering from last night – it’s a matter of perspective) is Labor Senator Kristina Keneally, releasing a joint statement with Catherine King, calling for an “urgent review” of security at Australia’s airport. It comes after a report from 60 Minutes yesterday, followed up by reports in the Sydney Morning Herald, alleged that Qantas had been infiltrated by organised crime to facilitate drug importation. Keneally described the revelations as “deeply disturbing” and said it was “frustrating” the Coalition had “held up” changes to airport security legislation, although it is unclear how that would stop alleged criminals being hired by Qantas. Of note also was Australia Criminal Intelligence Commission boss Mike Phelan saying Australia “has an insatiable demand for all types of drugs”. Make of that what you will. Some tweets now to visualise those Newspoll results: Good morning and happy Monday to all. My name is Mostafa Rachwani and I will be guiding you through the news this morning. We begin with a poll of over 1,000 people that found that 75% of Australians support compulsory Covid vaccines for aged care staff, coming on the heels of last week’s national cabinet meeting, where the idea was being seriously considered. It comes after Victoria recorded four cases yesterday, including a 79-year-old resident and a nurse at an aged care centre. The resident lives in “close proximity” to the previous two cases from the Arcare aged care home in Maidstone. It also comes after Western Australia was put on alert after a returned overseas travelled tested positive after leaving hotel quarantine. There are now a number of potential exposure sites and the man is back in hotel quarantine. In federal politics, health minister Greg Hunt announced an extra 330,000 vaccines would be directed to Victoria, and said people should seize the “moment of momentum” and get a jab. And according to Newspoll, the Coalition has pulled level with Labor on a two-party-preferred basis, but prime minister Scott Morrison’s support has nosedived in the wake of the vaccine rollout.","charCount":"33790","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/mostafa-rachwani-\">Mostafa Rachwani</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/commentisfree/2021/jun/07/public-opinion-supports-action-on-inequality-jacinda-ardern-has-no-more-excuses","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-07T03:25:34Z","webTitle":"Public opinion supports action on inequality.

Logan Paul, standing in the late fashion designer’s mansion in Miami Beach during a media event on Thursday spouting garbage about knocking out one of the greatest boxers of all time, will also be remembered, albeit for different reasons. “I am that dude, the guy who does something no one else thinks they can do,” he said before scotching the record - 50-0 if anyone has forgotten - of Floyd Mayweather, the former welterweight champion of the world. “I don’t give a fuck. He hasn’t knocked anyone out for a decade.” That could very well change on Sunday night at Miami’s Hard Rock Stadium when Mayweather, 44, returns to the ring once again to face a YouTuber whose finest accomplishments include giving CPR to a fish and tasering two dead rats. The Pretty Boy was all smiles during fight week, brushing off accusations of the bout being no more than a joke, while stressing that although he has indeed retired, he will never quit entertaining and earning money. “I always want to take chances and do something different,” he said. “I live for Floyd Mayweather. People choose a profession because they do what they want to do. “So I want to go out, have some fun, and if I make $50m, $60m, $70m, $100m, let me do it. I’m not out robbing or killing.” You can’t blame Mayweather, who had a skip in his step following his youngest daughter’s graduation – “She already had a Mercedes, but I got her the Jeep Wagoneer she wanted” - for trying to boost his bank balance and keep his kids in plush wheels for life. He last appeared on New Year’s Eve 2018 in Japan when a kickboxer was dispatched within the first round. He claims to have already made $30m during the build-up to his latest return and with pay-per-view figures set to be substantial, plenty more is heading his way. “We are always thinking outside of the box,” said Leonard Ellerby, CEO of Mayweather Promotions. The 26 year-old Paul isn’t short of a few bucks either. His ability to have used social media to make himself and his similarly obnoxious brother multimillionaires is impressive, even if the individuals are not. They are new-age businessmen, even if what they are monetizing may seem inane to older people. Promoters are always looking for ways to generate fresh revenue and, in today’s climate, those with a huge following on YouTube, Twitter and Instagram are the targets. That’s a lot of young eyeballs – most of whom probably have absolutely no idea of how revered Mayweather was in his pomp – and will undoubtedly be tempted to pay the $49.99 to watch what transpires at the home of the Miami Dolphins. After pulling back the curtain, however, there’s not much left to see. Mayweather ended his career in 2015 as one of the best boxers in history (his fight against UFC’s Conor McGregor in 2017 technically counted towards his record, even if it was little more than a very lucrative exhibition) morphing his aggressive younger self into someone who perfected the art of avoiding getting hit. This will be an unorthodox fight, to put it mildly. There will be no judges and a win will only come from a stoppage or knockout. It will be eight, three-minute rounds consisting of a manchild with just two bouts to his name (both against fellow YouTuber KSI; one defeat, one draw) trying to achieve what the likes of Oscar De La Hoya, Manny Pacquiao and Canelo Álvarez all failed to do and beat the man from Grand Rapids, Michigan. “It’s like an Evel Knievel stunt meets a circus meets pugilism,” said New York-based promoter Terry Lane. “But, at the end of the day, it’s only interesting because they are fighting. We aren’t tuning in to watch them play tennis.” Intriguing? Perhaps. Mayweather, retired or not, remains pure box-office material. But a sporting spectacle? Turn off the lights and take a short nap. At a time when traumatic brain injuries are coming into sharp focus, the last thing boxing needs is another reason for the detractors to shout louder. McGregor talked a wonderful game and enticed over four million people to buy the pay-per-view ($99.95 for HD) and watch him hopelessly prance around the ring in 2017 and barely trouble Mayweather who was laughing all the way to the bank, once again. Discussions over a rematch surfaced last Thursday and, although there wouldn’t be the same kind of clamour experienced for the first meeting, at least both protagonists are professional fighters. You just don’t play boxing. This is a dangerous sport and although Paul is taller and expected to be heavier by almost 30lbs than his legendary opponent, the prospect of him getting hurt remains. No one will ever stop the boxing business from grinding out the dollars, but if something catastrophic were to happen here on Sunday night, the chances of this kind of event happening in the future would recede. Fighters train for a reason. Paul is not a fighter, he never will be. The devil, however, is in the numbers. Jake Paul, Logan’s younger brother, reportedly brought in 1.3m views for his most recent fight in April against mixed martial artist Ben Askren and generated around $75m. Next up for Jake is UFC fighter Tyron Woodley and the tiresome barbs have already begun, along with the ring of the cash register. Unfortunately, we will probably see Logan in the ring again and yes, when the call came asking him about fighting Mayweather, of course this serial chancer was going to accept. The problem is, we shouldn’t have been here in the first place. Let Mayweather, if he wants, come back and fight real boxers. Seeing the likes of Mike Tyson and Roy Jones Jr attempt to roll back the years was hard to watch but somewhat acceptable. Logan can keep springing his pranks for his millions of fans of YouTube. That’s what he’s best at so perhaps leave the serious stuff for professionals and spare the rest of us some earache.","charCount":"5932","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/steve-brenner\">Steve Brenner</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2021/jun/06/angela-merkels-cdu-beats-far-right-in-crucial-german-state-election","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-07T01:13:55Z","webTitle":"Angela Merkel’s CDU beats far right in crucial German state election","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/06/angela-merkels-cdu-beats-far-right-in-crucial-german-state-election","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/jun/06/angela-merkels-cdu-beats-far-right-in-crucial-german-state-election","fields":{"headline":"Angela Merkel’s CDU beats far right in crucial German state election","standfirst":"<p>Conservative win in Saxony-Anhalt seen as last big test ahead of national election in September</p>","trailText":"Conservative win in Saxony-Anhalt seen as last big test ahead of national election in September","byline":"Philip Oltermann in Berlin","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d9e2c1c13384658ea3be7af5c6768724e6ece9af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9e2c1c13384658ea3be7af5c6768724e6ece9af/340_443_2886_1732/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Reiner Haseloff.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Saxony-Anhalt’s CDU state premier, Reiner Haseloff, has ruled out power-sharing with the far-right AfD party.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Filip Singer/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) fought off a challenge from the far right in a state election on Sunday seen as the last big test for Germany’s political parties before a national vote in September that will end the chancellor’s 16&nbsp;years atop German politics.</p> <p>The CDU, whose current leader, Armin Laschet, will vie for the top job in September, improved on its 2017 performance to gain 37% of the vote in the eastern state, <a href=\"https://www.tagesschau.de/wahl/\">according to </a>public service broadcaster ARD early on Monday.

The agreement to build the US$43m venue was signed on 28 May by Paga Hill Development Corporation and the National Gaming Control Board (NGCB), drawing immediate condemnation from Transparency International. “They [the NGCB] are the referee responsible for applying the rules of the game; they should not be running around as a player on the field,” said Transparency International PNG board chair Peter Aitsi. “The global experience with casinos suggests an increased likelihood of money laundering and undue political influence where the regulator is weak or is compromised,” he added. George Hallit, Paga Hill’s chief operating officer, defended the plans, saying the casino would create thousands of jobs directly and indirectly. He also argued that the casino, which will include a hotel, shopping malls and cinemas, would attract tourists, arguing that only one-third of visits to PNG were currently tourism related. “China’s growing middle class is forecast to account for a quarter of all international tourism by 2030. Eighty per cent of Chinese first-time international tourists visit a casino, and 90% of Chinese visitors to the US visit Las Vegas,” he said. But Paul Barker, executive director of the independent thinktank the Institute of National Affairs, said that Papua New Guinea did not have the welfare or legal infrastructure to deal with the problems that often accompany gambling. The introduction of slot machines in PNG had already had a “considerable” social impact with many becoming “hooked and squandering their limited incomes in the hope of many a win, but instead leaving themselves in increasing debt and often failing to feed their facilities, breaking their families, causing people to lose their jobs and livelihood,” he said. “Casinos take it to a higher level. Our big neighbour, Australia, has some of the toughest rules and capacity to manage their gambling industry, and they also have strong education and social welfare systems, nevertheless Australia has amongst the worst levels of gambling addiction in the world, with associated damaging social, family and economic consequences. “PNG certainly doesn’t have the laws, penalties, governance, education or welfare capacity that Australia has, and it has serious law and order problems already. It certainly shouldn’t want to worsen the situation and having a major casino will certainly worsen the situation. “PNG also has a serious problem, where the regulatory body, the NGCB, is also seeking to be an investor in gaming ventures, including the proposed casino. This is wholly improper.” He also noted that casinos are often used for money laundering and argued that given widespread allegations of poor governance and corruption in Papua New Guinea there was “no way that the country can afford to take on this extra burden of permitting casino activities.” The Catholic church, a powerful voice in the largely Christian country, has also come out against the casino plans. Father Giorgio Licini, from the Papua New Guinea Catholic Bishops Conference, said it “breaks our heart to see what is being spent to provide entertainment for the elite and the privileged from outside and inside the country. “Our young people in the settlements and villages, instead, play rugby on improvised muddy fields full of plastic and rubbish. And no other facilities for healthy entertainment and leisure are built to keep them out of the streets and provide them opportunities for socialisation so necessary and meaningful at their age.” The NGCB did not respond to requests for comment from the Guardian but chairman Clemence Kanau said in an earlier statement that the regulator had been “at the forefront to ensure compliance on regulations and requirements” adding that it was also planning to “introduce lottery, bingo, online betting and other gaming activities to raise revenue and attract economic activities, employment and other opportunities.” “There are exciting times for PNG after the Covid-19 induced downfall in the country’s economy,” he said.","charCount":"4297","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/rebecca-kuku\">Rebecca Kuku</a> in Port Moresby"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2021/jun/07/icy-blast-to-bring-cold-weather-and-snow-to-eastern-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-07T00:29:35Z","webTitle":"Icy blast to bring cold weather and snow to eastern Australia ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/jun/07/icy-blast-to-bring-cold-weather-and-snow-to-eastern-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2021/jun/07/icy-blast-to-bring-cold-weather-and-snow-to-eastern-australia","fields":{"headline":"Icy blast to bring cold weather and snow to eastern Australia ","standfirst":"<p>Daytime temperatures forecast to be up to 7C below June average in parts of northern NSW</p>","trailText":"Daytime temperatures forecast to be up to 7C below June average in parts of northern NSW","byline":"Calla Wahlquist","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c8b440eb2baf41ed755c6be8c68730e45ce125af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8b440eb2baf41ed755c6be8c68730e45ce125af/19_28_849_509/500.jpg\" alt=\"A weather map\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A cold front from the ‘deep south’ will bring icy weather to eastern Australia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bureau of Meterology</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>An icy front is expected to bring snow to the central and northern tablelands of New South Wales on Wednesday and Thursday, with temperatures forecast to be up to seven degrees below average in northern parts of the state.</p> <p>Sydney and parts of coastal NSW have already shivered through a cold morning on Monday, with clear skies seeing temperatures dropping to 0.8C in Camden, 1.4C in Lake Macquarie and 2C in Campbelltown.

Sydney airport recorded 8.6C. The overnight temperatures are not expected to drop lower but daytime temperatures will remain low until the cold front passes through, according to the Bureau of Meteorology NSW forecaster Melody Sturm. Western NSW is in for daytime temperatures between 2C and 5C below the June average. In the northern tablelands, ranges, and northern slopes, temperatures will be about 7C cooler than average. A dusting of snow is also possible on the Grampians/Gariwerd on Tuesday. The cold front will cross into south-west Victoria on Monday night and move across to Melbourne on Tuesday, dropping the temperature from a relatively mild 18C on Monday to 13C on Tuesday and Wednesday. “We are predicting snow down to 900m in the south-west which could mean we get some snow on the peaks of the Grampians,” said Christie Johnson, a duty forecaster with the bureau. The cold air is coming up from the “far south”, according to Johnson, meaning temperatures will be “much colder than they have been”, but no record-breaking temperatures are forecast. Central Victoria is expected to be “quite cold”, with Ballarat peaking at 9C on Wednesday. Snow is also forecast to be down to 1,000m for the rest of the state on Tuesday and Wednesday, rising to 1,400m on Thursday. The cold front could be followed by thunderstorms and heavy rain, particularly in Gippsland on Wednesday and Thursday. The front will reach western NSW on Tuesday morning and Sydney and the coast by Wednesday. Canberra will reach just 8.4C on Wednesday, about 4C below the average daily temperature for June. Guyra is forecast to reach just 3C during the day on Thursday. Walcha will reach 4.3C, Armidale 5.7C, Glen Innes 4.9C and Tenterfield 7.6C.

The icy weather will also reach southern Queensland on Thursday, with Goondiwindi expected to record a daytime temperature of just 13C . Stanthorpe will reach just 8C, with a low of -2C, and even Charleville will reach just 15C. Meanwhile, a severe weather warning has been issued for South Australia’s southern coastal regions as a blast of wintery weather moves across the state. Wind gusts of up to 100km/h are forecast on Monday with locations likely to be affected including Port Lincoln, Mount Gambier, Murray Bridge, Kingscote, Naracoorte, Cleve, Minlaton and Victor Harbor. The BOM says a vigorous cold front will move across the west and south bringing significant rain and hail to some regions. Adelaide is forecast to have up to 15mm on Monday and then up to 20mm on Tuesday. Total falls could reach 60mm in the Adelaide Hills. The strong winds ahead of the cold front will also lead to raised dust in some country regions. Moving into Tuesday, snow is also possible on the highest peaks in the Flinders Ranges with some top temperatures barely rising into double figures.

Thanks for reading and we’ll be back in a few hours with more rolling coverage of the pandemic. Meanwhile, you can find all our coronavirus stories, features and analysis here. Key developments from the past few hours: The UK recorded 5,341 cases on Sunday, an increase of 2,101 on last Sunday when 3,111 cases were reported. Portugal’s prime minister has criticised Britain for removing the country from the green list, allowing travellers to visit Portugal without quarantine on return. Ministers are ‘absolutely open’ to delaying the 21 June reopening date in England if the Delta variant worsens, the health secretary said. Sunday is the first day for 12-16-year-olds in Israel to get vaccinated, after 55% of the population have so far received two doses in the country. Morocco will reopen its airports to international traffic starting from 15 June to help the return of its nationals living abroad Staff of a senate committee investigating the handling of the pandemic in Brazil have said that the Copa America football tournament should not be held amid the world’s second-deadliest outbreak and must be postponed. Uganda’s president, Yoweri Museveni, re-imposed a strict lockdown that included the closure of schools and the suspension of inter-district travel. Victorians are being warned there is no ‘magic number’ of the people getting vaccinated before future lockdowns can be avoided. That’s all from me tonight. Thank you all for following along with me! First lady Jill Biden and Dr Anthony Fauci toured a Covid-19 vaccination site at a historic Harlem church on Sunday. AP reports, Biden, Fauci and US Sen Kirsten Gillibrand, a New York Democrat, watched as people got their shots in the basement of the Abyssinian Baptist Church. Biden asked a teenager about to get his shot how old he was, and when he said he was 14, she responded, “You’re 14, that’s exactly what we want! Twelve and over.” The Abyssinian Baptist Church has often hosted elected officials and other dignitaries, including in February when former President Bill Clinton and former Sen. Hillary Clinton attended a memorial service for actor Cicely Tyson. The church first started offering vaccine doses in January in an effort to boost the vaccination rates in New York City’s Black and Hispanic communities. Victorians are being warned there is no ‘magic number’ of the people getting vaccinated before future lockdowns can be avoided, AAP reports. Four new cases were reported on Sunday, including two linked to the Arcare Maidstone aged care facility in the city’s northwest. Victoria’s Deputy Chief Health Officer Allen Cheng said it was challenging to say what proportion would need to be vaccinated to avoid future lockdowns. Pro Cheng said, “There isn’t one single magic number. “Once you get up to much higher coverage rates, then it makes a whole lot of things easier. “We may not need the intensity of restrictions. We may be able to only do contact tracing without having to do other things quite to the same level, and that is the benefit of vaccination.” But Prof Cheng expects that Melbourne will be able to ease restrictions on Friday, saying, “We don’t want to be in this any longer than we need to. So if we can, we will lift it early.” Brazil has recorded 39,637 new cases in the past 24 hours and 873 deaths, the health ministry said on Sunday. The numbers reflect a weekend drop – in both cases and deaths – on a rolling seven-day average. Brazil is reporting more than 1,800 deaths a day. The country has now registered 16,947,062 cases since the pandemic began, while the official death toll has risen to 473,404, according to ministry data, in the world’s third-worst outbreak outside the United States and India, and its second-deadliest. The UK correspondent for the Italian news outlet La Repubblica, Antonello Guerrera, reports that the Spanish football captain Sergio Busquets has tested positive for Covid-19. Uganda’s president, Yoweri Museveni, re-imposed a strict lockdown that included the closure of schools and the suspension of inter-district travel to help beat back a surge in Covid-19 cases. The new measures will be effective from Monday morning. Reuters reports, Most of the new restrictions, Museveni said, would be implemented for 42 days. An assessment of their impact will then help the government decide whether to ease or prolong them, he added. Uganda implemented one of Africa’s tightest lockdowns at the beginning of the pandemic more than a year ago, but it was gradually lifted as cases slowed to a trickle. However, last month infections started to rise and new cases, particularly among younger people, have surged, fuelling fears that the country could slip into an out-of-control second wave. Museveni said in a televised address on Sunday night that a second wave gripping the country was “diffuse and sustained”. The government, he said, was worried the jump in cases would “exhaust the available bed space and oxygen supply in hospitals unless we constitute urgent public health measures”. “In this wave the intensity of severe and critically ill Covid-19 patients and death is higher than what we experienced in the first wave of the pandemic,” he said. Covid-19 infections in Uganda are on an average daily basis at their peak, with 825 new infections reported each day, according to a Reuters analysis. From January to April the positivity rate in tested samples was mostly below 3% but the rate started climbing sharply last month, hitting 18% on 2 June, according to health ministry data. The east African country has thus far reported nearly 53,000 positive cases and 383 deaths. The new restrictions potentially threaten to arrest an already fragile economic recovery from the blow inflicted by last year’s lockdown. Those restrictions contributed to a 1.1% economic contraction in 2020, but the finance ministry had projected before Sunday’s new measures that growth would climb to between 4% and 5% in the fiscal year starting in July. The US has administered 301,638,578 Covid-19 jabs and distributed 371,520,735 doses as of Sunday morning, the CDC said. The latest figures are up from the 300,268,730 vaccine doses the CDC said had been administered by 5 June out of 371,520,975 doses delivered. The agency also said 170,833,221 people had received at least one dose while 138,969,323 people are fully vaccinated as of Sunday. Staff of a senate committee investigating the handling of the pandemic in Brazil have said that the Copa America football tournament should not be held amid the world’s second deadliest outbreak and must be postponed. Brazil was announced as host of the Copa America competition after joint-host Colombia was removed because of civil unrest and Argentina pulled out owing to a surge in Covid-19 cases. In a letter to the national football team, the senate commission said the country had only vaccinated 10.77% of the population until Friday with first doses. The commission said: “Brazil does not offer sanitary security for holding an international tournament of this magnitude. In addition to transmitting a false sense of security and normality, opposite to the reality that Brazilians are living, it would encourage agglomerations of people and set a bad example. “We are not against Copa America in Brazil or anywhere else. But we believe the tournament can wait until the country is ready to host it.” Reuters reports that the letter added that not holding the tournament in the country or participating in it would be a gesture of those who have lost their lives to the pandemic. The letter came two days after the captain of the Brazil football team said the squad would be making a statement on Tuesday about whether or not they want to compete in the competition. Brazilian media reports said the players do not want to play in a hastily arranged tournament due to kick off in a week while they are busy playing to qualify for the World Cup next year. After more than 15 months in varying degrees of lockdown, the US is finally ready to reopen this summer – and the signs are that plenty of people are beginning to emerge into the light, with their wallets loaded and their hearts seeking song, dance and travel. Sixty-three per cent of US adults have now received at least one vaccine dose, and as life returns to “normal”, hotels and concerts are selling out, rental cars and rental homes are booked up, and visits to museums and events are soaring. The rebound is happening so fast it’s being compared to the Roaring 20s when people came out from the gloom of a devastating flu pandemic and a global war to foxtrot and make merry. But there is a catch. Prices of some goods are soaring as shortages of lumber, chicken, and other products meet higher demand, stoking fears of inflation. A key inflation indicator – the personal consumption expenditures index – rose to 3.1% in April from a year earlier as price pressures built. And as restaurants and bars welcome back revellers, many are struggling to hire staff to cope with the demand. So far, however, rising prices have not dampened people’s enthusiasm for events and trips. In Tennessee, tickets for the Bonnaroo music festival sold out in record time, as did the Electric Daisy and Rolling Loud festivals, held in Las Vegas and Miami, respectively, as musicians and artists return to touring after more than a year of staying home. The 100,000 tickets for the Astroworld festival in Houston sold out in 30 minutes, its organizer said. “Fans are buying tickets, and events are selling out faster than ever,” Michael Rapino, chief executive of the Live Nation ticket company, said this month. “We’re just seeing demand beyond any other historic moment.” More on the story by Adam Gabbatt and Sajina Shrestha in New York, here: The US will donate 750,000 vaccine doses to Taiwan, a cross-party delegation of US senators said as they arrived in the country. AFP report that the high-profile delegation and gift come as Taiwan accuses China of hampering its efforts to secure enough doses as part of Beijing’s ongoing campaign to keep the island isolated. Morocco will reopen its airports to international traffic starting from 15 June to help the return of its nationals living abroad, the country’s foreign ministry said on Sunday. Foreign nationals will also be allowed into the country if they have been vaccinated against Covid-19 or had a negative PCR test. According to a tally compiled by AFP, since the outbreak first emerged in December 2019, at least 3,723,381 people have died from Covid-19. The US is the worst affected country, with 597,377 deaths from 33,357,240 cases. The next hardest-hit countries are Brazil with 472,531 deaths, India with 346,759, Mexico with 228,754 and Peru with 186,073. The WHO estimates the pandemic’s overall toll could be two to three times higher than official records because of the excess mortality directly and indirectly linked to Covid-19. Sunday is the first day for 12-16-year-olds in Israel to get vaccinated, after 55% of the population have so far received two doses in the country. The move to vaccinate teenagers came despite the country’s health ministry recently releasing finding that suggests a “possible link” between the Pfizer/BioNTech jab and cases of myocarditis – inflammation of the heart muscle – among younger men. Ministers are ‘absolutely open’ to delaying the 21 June reopening date in England if the Delta variant worsens the country’s recovery prospects, the health secretary said. Matt Hancock, in what is thought to be the clearest indication yet that the target date could be missed, stressed that 21 June was a “not before” date and that it was only “pencilled in” as the next step out of lockdown, PA reports. The minister also implied that social distancing could continue beyond the final stage of the roadmap. Pushed on whether the removal of restrictions date could be postponed if the Delta variant data “gets bad”, Hancock told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: “We are absolutely open to doing that if that’s what needs to happen. “We said in the roadmap that June 21 is the date by which we would not take Step 4 before that date and that we would look at the data. “That is exactly what we are doing, so the roadmap was set up in order to be able to take these sort of changes into account.” As of Sunday, 27,957,453 people received their first dose in France, and 13,709,004 people have completed their vaccine cycle. The country also reported 5,070 new Covid-19 cases. France recorded 25 new deaths and 2 new ICU admissions on Sunday. The latest figures are added to a total of 83,572 deaths in hospital since the pandemic began and 2,527 people currently in the hospital for Covid-19. Health experts remain divided over the dangers posed by the new Delta variant of Covid-19 and the risks it poses to the nation as ministers consider whether or not to lift lockdown later this month. Some argue that the new variant, first identified in India, is a significantly increased threat to the UK and have urged that delays be imposed on the total removal of social restrictions, due on 21 June. “By the government’s own criteria, it would be foolish now to proceed on the data that we’ve got. The risk would be very great indeed,’ said Professor Stephen Reicher, a member of the Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours (SPI-B) which advises the government. Reicher said the current assessment of the risks not being fundamentally changed by the appearance of the Delta variant was “not upheld”. This view was backed by scientists of the Independent Sage group, who argued that data indicated the Delta variant had higher infectivity and was more likely to cause disease and hospitalisations. “That makes it very difficult to justify progressing with the last stage of lockdown,” the group said last week. Other scientists believe such calls are premature. While urging caution, they say fears that the Delta variant poses a significant new threat – both in terms of infectivity and as a cause of serious illness – are premature. “The suggestion that the India variant is more pathogenic needs to be taken with a big dose of salt,” said Ian Jones, professor of virology, Reading University. More on the story here: Italy recorded 51 deaths and 2,275 new cases on Sunday, the health ministry has said. The latest figures are down from yesterday’s 57 deaths and 2,436 cases. Patients in hospital with Covid-19, not including those in intensive care, were recorded at 4,963 on Sunday, down from 5,193 a day earlier. There were 20 new admissions to intensive care units, unchanged from Saturday. The total number of intensive care patients fell to 774 from a previous 788. Since the pandemic began in February, Italy has registered 126,523 coronavirus-related deaths, the second-highest toll in Europe after Britain and the eight-highest in the world. Portugal’s prime minister has criticised Britain for removing the country from the green list, allowing travellers to visit Portugal without quarantine on return. On Sunday, Antonio Costa urged London to adhere to a European digital certificate scheme to ease travel. Last week, Britain announced it was removing Portugal from its green list because of rising Covid-19 case numbers and the risk posed by coronavirus variants detected in Portugal. Costa told reporters, “We can’t have this system of instability and changes every three weeks.It isn’t good for those who plan their holidays, nor for those who have to organise the tourism industry to receive tourists in good conditions.” Costa adds that Portugal was maintaining a dialogue with the British government to “explain the decision is not justified and also the serious damage it causes to the British and to the Portuguese economy.” Reuters reports that under the proposed European digital certificate scheme, which the EU plan to introduce from 1 July, EU citizens who can prove they have been vaccinated against Coivd-19, tested negative for the disease or recovered from it will be able to travel freely in the bloc. However, the prime minister did not explain how Britain would adhere to the scheme after leaving the EU. The Covid-19 situation in Portugal has seen a slight increase in positive cases since lifting lockdown restrictions last month. Hospitalisations remain low and daily deaths are near zero following the vaccination of nearly all its most vulnerable elderly citizens. Hi, I’m Edna Mohamed; I’ll be taking over from my colleague Harry Taylor for the rest of the afternoon. If I miss anything, you can message me on Twitter or drop me an email at edna.mohamed.casual@theguardian.com The UK records 5,341 positive coronavirus cases on Sunday and four new deaths, according to government data. This is an increase of 2,101 on last Sunday when 3,240 cases were reported. While daily deaths are down -1% in the last seven days, case numbers are up by 11,022 (49.0%) in the same period. Here’s a round-up of today’s latest coronavirus news from around the world: Eradicating Covid-19 worldwide is not a “reasonable target”, according to a World Health Organization envoy on the virus. Dr David Nabarro said people will have to learn to live with the virus in circulation. Boris Johnson has outlined his ambition to see the planet vaccinated by the end of 2022, ahead of the G7 summit in Cornwall starting on Friday. He will also call for a global watch system to identify new variants. Countries in the Asia-Pacific region are looking to develop their home-grown vaccines as supply shortages threaten efforts to tackle the pandemic. UK health secretary Matt Hancock says it’s “too early” to make a final decision on whether there will be a delay to restrictions being relaxed on 21 June. Former UK prime minister Tony Blair has called for the rules to be relaxed for people who have had both doses of the vaccine, and for Covid-certification for travel. More than 57m doses of Covid-19 vaccines have been given to people in England, latest NHS England data shows. Nearly 23.5 million people have had both doses of the vaccine, with 33.7 million having had at least one jab. UK government ministers are considering giving people a different type of Covid vaccine as an autumn booster, after early results from “mix and match” trials appeared to show promise for an enhanced immune response. Russia has reported 9,145 new Covid-19 cases and a further 399 deaths. A total of 5,117,274 people have tested positive and 123,436 have died. Russia’s own statistics service suggests the actual number to die from the virus may be higher. Germany has registered 2,440 new cases in the last 24 hours, and 24.7 cases per 100,000 people, according to the country’s Robert Koch Institute. A further 74 people have died from the virus, meaning the death toll stands at 89,222. No deaths have been reported from Covid in Wales for the tenth day in a row, according to the latest public health statistics. A total of 92 new cases have been confirmed, bringing the number of infections recorded in the country to 213,091. 5,569 people have died. Campaigners have criticised Boris Johnson for his “audacity” in calling for the world’s population to be vaccinated by the end of next year (see 08:31), accusing him of blocking attempts to scale up production. Global Justice Now said the UK is one of the countries, along with Germany, which is stopping an intellectual property waiver on vaccines and treatments at the World Trade Organization. India and South Africa first proposed a waiver eight months ago, but some countries have obstructed it. The US said last month it would support a waiver. The director of the charity, Nick Dearden, said: “The audacity of Boris Johnson preaching about the need to vaccinate the world is staggering. The UK is one of the last remaining countries blocking an intellectual property waiver on Covid-19 vaccines. “Simply setting a deadline is not leadership. If the prime minister wants to achieve global vaccination by 2022, he should follow in Joe Biden’s footsteps and support an intellectual property waiver on Covid-19 vaccines and treatments.” More than 57 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines have now been given to people in the UK, latest NHS England data shows. The total – 57,193,641 jabs – include both first and second jabs. The latest figures show a total of 590,645 people were vaccinated yesterday. Nearly 23.5 million people have had both doses of the vaccine, with 33.7 million having had at least one jab. Ministers are considering giving people a different type of Covid vaccine as an autumn booster, it has emerged, after early results from “mix and match” trials appeared to show promise for an enhanced immune response. Four different coronavirus jabs have been approved for use in the UK, with more under regulatory review. While people are currently offered two doses of the same jab, researchers have been exploring whether offering a second dose of a different Covid vaccine could generate a stronger immune response. It is also expected that people will be offered a third, “booster” injection, potentially in the autumn, in part to protect them against variants with some resistance to existing vaccines. One possibility being looked at is that this third jab could be of a different type to people’s initial two, a government source said. Trials worldwide are exploring the impact of max and match doses. In the UK, the Com-Cov study, launched in February, is investigating the possibility of using the Oxford/AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax vaccines. The Sunday Telegraph reported promising results from separate trials of more than 600 people in Spain and 300 in Germany. Matt Hancock has formally denied the claim from Dominic Cummings that he incorrectly promised people discharged from hospitals to care homes were being tested for Covid at the start of the pandemic, saying: “No, I did not.” The rejection, after lengthy questioning on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, follows the health secretary’s previous refusal to deny explicitly the claim in the Commons and at a Downing Street press conference, a day after Cummings’ explosive claims to MPs. But in an indication of Hancock’s likely approach when he is quizzed by the same parliamentary committee on Thursday, he argued that Cummings had not in fact accused him of wrongly claiming tests were already being done in March last year – only that they would happen when testing capacity was available. Eradicating Covid-19 from the world is not currently a “reasonable target”, a World Health Organization Covid-19 official has said. Dr David Nabarro, a special envoy to the WHO, said people will have to learn to live with the disease, comments which were echoed by Dame Anne Johnson, a professor of infection disease epidemiology at University College London (UCL). Nabarro told Sky News’ Trevor Phillips on Sunday: “Humanity is going to have to learn how to co-exist with this virus, preventing it from spiking and then surging and causing hotspots of disease, and we’re going to have to be able to do this for the foreseeable future. “Eradication is not currently a reasonable target for the world.” He said: “Each time there is a sudden surge, it does stimulate in one’s mind the thought that there might be a new variant appearing. That wouldn’t be surprising.” He said that will be “the pattern for the future”, adding: “This virus isn’t going away any time soon, there will be variants emerging.” A Dublin pub landlord has said the hospitality industry in Ireland faces difficulties replacing staff who left during the pandemic. Kevin Barden, whose family owns the traditional Irish music pub O’Donoghue’s, told PA Media he has been fortunate to welcome back 19 of his 20-strong team after 15 months of closure. Others have struggled to recruit staff and are finding it hard to fill roles ahead of reopening. “We’ve only lost one for the moment and hopefully we’ll get him back by the end of the summer. So we’ve been lucky enough – we’ve retained the majority of the staff here, which has been great.” Like so many workers across Ireland, the staff have received an income through government Covid-19 wage subsidy support. “They’ve obviously had to take a hit and they all have families and mortgages and bills to pay as well,” said Barden. It’s a month tomorrow since Public Health England published a report on the India variant in the UK when there were 509 identified cases. Since then the case numbers in the country have risen 20-fold and case numbers are continuing to rise. This thread from PHE expert Meaghan Kall on where things in England are now is well worth a read: Countries in the Asia-Pacific region are looking to develop their home-grown vaccines as supply shortages threaten efforts to tackle the pandemic. Japan, South Korea, India, Taiwan, Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam are hoping to develop their own jabs after struggling to get vaccines from overseas, according to the South China Morning Post. While locally developed vaccines aren’t likely to affect the pandemic in its current phase, they believe it’s a better long-term approach. Germany has registered 2,440 new cases in the last 24 hours, and 24.7 cases per 100,000 people, according to the country’s Robert Koch Institute. The latest figures show 74 more people have died from the virus, meaning the death toll now stands at 89,222. There has been a total of 3,700,367 positive tests for Covid since the start of the pandemic. The new Delta variant of coronavirus appears to be about 40% more transmissible than the variant it has largely replaced, Matt Hancock has said, making government decisions about whether to ease restrictions in England on 21 June “more difficult”. Saying that under-30s will be called to begin vaccinations from next week, the health secretary confirmed it was still possible the reopening programme could be delayed or some rules kept in place. “We consider all options,” he told Sky News. Away from the UK, Russia has reported 9,145 new Covid-19 cases and a further 399 deaths. A total of 5,117,274 people have tested positive in the country. The death toll in the country now stands at 123,436. Russia’s own state statistics service, Rosstat, keeps its own records and said on Friday that about 270,000 people had died from the virus and related causes as of April. Excess deaths in the county stand at 425,000 from between April 2020 and April 2021. Marr rounds off by asking whether the health secretary regretted using the phrase about a “protective ring” around care homes. “I said that much later about what we were doing for the winter plans, but it’s been interpreted,” he says, but changes the subject on to the return of children to school tomorrow after half-term. “On testing, tomorrow schoolchildren will be going back to school. You must get tests done this evening because right now secondary school-age children getting their tests done tonight is the most important thing that can be done today.” Marr asks whether Hancock will apologise for any failings on his part during the pandemic, as Cummings did. “At that time everybody was working as hard as possible to protect as many lives as possible on the evidence we had at the time,” he says. “This is true of different administrations and across the whole of Europe. “I know those decisions were taken on the best evidence with the best of intentions.” Marr ends by asking whether Hancock’s been honest and transparent during the pandemic after claims made by Dominic Cummings during his select committee appearance last week. He plays a clip of Cummings saying that in March 2020 Hancock said people would be tested before they went back to care homes and there was a protective shield around them. “It’s complete nonsense,” Cummings said. He asks Hancock whether he told Johnson that people would be tested before they went into care homes. He replies: “We know the testing wasn’t available to test everybody. The advice was that very few people would be able to pass on Covid if they didn’t have any symptoms, so we reserved that for people with symptoms. “The situation with regards to care homes, we brought in a policy of wanting to test everybody going into a care home as soon as we had those tests available. Everyone had a challenge around Europe, in Scotland in Wales, some of the most vulnerable to Covid live in care homes, but at the time, you’ll remember we didn’t have the testing capacity and I built that up, put in place the hundreds of thousands targets and then we could put that into place.” On the idea of children being vaccinated, Hancock says the government is following clinical advice. “There’s good advantages, there’s the reduction in transmission from children to parents and grandparents who might be vulnerable. There’s advantages in protecting education, if one child gets one positive test, the whole bubble has to isolate. “We should follow and listen to clinical advice … I don’t want to put pressure on them with their advice. People should be reassured that whatever steps we take they are on a clinically advised basis.” In response to a question about vaccine passports, or certification along the lines mentioned by Tony Blair, Hancock says: “We know some other countries are going to require it. So if you want to go some other countries, you already have to, the EU are talking about it. It’s my job to make sure you can have that. “If you download the NHS app right now and register it will show you your vaccine status, so you can prove it if you want to go to Greece, for example.” He says rules in the UK are down to a certification review and that there is downsides on a mandatory basis. Hancock repeats Sage’s findings that the India variant is 40% more transmissible. In turn Marr quotes a Sage report saying that a variant of that level of transmissibility would cause severe disruption to the roadmap. Hancock says: “We’re watching the case rates and the rate in which that transfers into hospitalisations. Thankfully that link, which was absolutely rock solid over the autumn, is severed but not broken. There are some people in hospital who have been double vaccinated, but very few. The majority in hospital haven’t been. “Critically, those who are double vaccinated, even if they’re in hospital, they appear to be less ill. The vaccine is working and is our way through it, the new variant, which is more transmissible is making that calculation harder.” Matt Hancock’s now appearing on Marr, after his earlier interview on Sky News’ Trevor Phillips on Sunday. He first responds to an earlier interview by Bob Geldof calling for more vaccines to go to developing countries. The health secretary references Boris Johnson’s call to get the planet vaccinated by the end of 2022, and the rollout of the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab at cost to low and middle income countries. The cut to the aid budget, he says, is supposed to be temporary. “We also have this enormous cost there, so we can continue investing in the NHS, which we are doing, but there’s many things we are doing, leadership on climate change and certainly the work that AZ and Oxford University have done that a quarter of the vaccines across the whole world are delivered with UK taxpayers cash, at cost, no charge on intellectual property, and that’s saving lives everywhere.” Nandy backs vaccination for children after the JCVI’s approval of the Pfizer jab for 12-15 year olds. “I think the regulator has been clear that for 12-year-olds and over the Pfizer vaccine is safe and it’s apparent that the rise in transmission rates is being driven by young people. “It’s right to follow the public health officials particularly the ones that are saying ‘this is what we want to do’. “If public health directors are saying ‘we’ve got a problem in our secondary schools and we need to open up the vaccine, not to make it mandatory, offer the chance to get them vaccinated’, then we need to listen. If we’d taken that approach from the start we’d be in a far better place now.” On international travel Nandy says she believes the current Amber list for international travel from the UK should be scrapped. Current rules mean people travelling to the UK from those countries must quarantine at home or the place they are staying for 10 days and take two Covid tests during that period. She adds: “It’s confusing and that confusion is dangerous at the moment and risks unravelling all the progress that we’ve made. “I think we should have robust quarantine measures for people coming back into the country. “We need to be much clearer that at the moment travelling overseas, particularly when you’ve got countries like Vietnam and Thailand on the amber list where new variants are emerging and being imported into the UK, is the wrong thing to do and the government ought to be clear about that.” Labour’s shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy tells Marr says she’s sceptical on a domestic level on vaccine passports. “I think the global case for vaccine passports is clear because other countries are doing it, but at a domestic level for many of the reasons that you’ve highlighted, discriminatory practices, how they would be enforced, I think there are potentially real problems.” Here’s more detail on the proposal put forward by the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change. People who have been vaccinated against Covid-19 should be able to travel abroad using a new digital pass and go to “vaccine-only” venues such as restaurants or sports stadiums, Tony Blair says today. Releasing a report entitled “Less Risk, More Freedom”, by the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, the former prime minister says the time has come “to distinguish for the purposes of freedom from restriction between the vaccinated and unvaccinated”. The report argues that to date, measures intended to reduce the spread of disease have treated populations as largely homogenous groups. As a result, restrictions – such as national lockdowns, regional-tier systems and entire schools closed following outbreaks – have been blunt instruments. Tony Blair’s on BBC One’s Andrew Marr Show. He says he thinks it’s “uncertain” as to whether the UK will carry on with rules being relaxed on 21 June. Marr says that with introducing vaccine passports or certification status, it will end up discriminating against people who have not had the jab. Blair replies: “Discrimination has got a very loaded meaning in the English Language now. Really when it comes to risk management it’s all about discrimination. The reason we vaccinate the elderly first is that they are more at risk. The reason we ensure people are vaccinated is that we reduce the risk of transmission.” In response to a follow-up question, the former prime minister adds that there needs to be exemptions made for certain groups, including the disabled, as it would be “totally inappropriate” to discriminate against them. Taiwan reported 343 new Covid-19 cases on Sunday, down from 511 reported the day before. The US announced on Sunday that it will give it 750,000 vaccine doses. Phillips asks if we could be giving more vaccines to other countries ahead of the G7 summit next week. Hancock says: “My first duty is to protect the UK population, and that’s to reduce transmission. The way we’re helping the rest of the world is giving away at cost the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine and that means of the 2 billion doses delivered across the world, 500m doses are the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. 70% of those doses are in low and middle-income countries. “The reason we’ve been able to do this is is that we’ve made it available at cost, no charge of intellectual property from the start. I’m delighted there’s a debate, around the G7 table on how to vaccinate the world, but this country has done more than any other by ensuring the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is available at cost.” Responding on whether the government will respond to Blair’s call earlier (see 8.19), for global vaccine passports, as well as relaxations domestically for people who have had the jab. Hancock says: “This debate has been going on for months and we’ve been doing the work inside government, and we’ll be coming out with our answers on that soon. “We know it’s going to be needed internationally, on the domestic front, that’s a matter for Michael Gove.” Phillips asks if the government will want to vaccinate all children. The UK regulator, Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, approved the Pfizer jab for use on children aged between 12 and 15 earlier this week. A story in the Sunday Telegraph said that under plans drawn up by Whitehall, they would be offered the jab from mid-August. Hancock doesn’t rule it out, and says: “We’ve got a few weeks until we come out with a plan on how and if we take this forward. “We know the vaccine both protects you and helps stops it transmitting, and I want to protect education as much as anybody does. Making sure we don’t have those whole bubbles going home and the isolation, that has big upsides for education.” Under-30s in England will be invited to get their jabs this week, Hancock adds, as he says the link between infection and serious illness has been “severed but not broken” by the vaccine. Phillips asks whether there will be a modification of the roadmap, such as lifting lockdown but still asking people to work from home. “There are a series of things at the moment that we’ve said will be part of step four, which include the rule of six and the fact there’s still some businesses that are closed. “We have four reviews into international travel and certification and social distancing, and we are concluding those reviews and doing that at the same time.” Hancock urges people to go and get their second dose to try and stop the damage being caused by the India variant, that is 40% more transmissible. “It’s more difficult to manage this virus with the new variant. But after two doses of vaccine we are confident that you get the same protection as you did with the old variant. “The vaccine works just as effectively, and everyone must get their second jab though, as the first on its own isn’t quite as effective.” The health secretary Matt Hancock is on Sky News’ Trevor Phillips on Sunday, as part of a morning broadcast tour. He asks Hancock whether there will be a delay to the relaxing of restrictions on 21 June. “It’s too early to make a final decision on that,” Hancock begins. “The prime minister and the team will be looking over all the data over this week and we’ve said we will be giving people enough time ahead of 21 June when this is pencilled in, this next step.” He says it will depend on the four tests; cases, hospitalisations, the rollout of the vaccine and the impact of new variants. Hancock admits that there has been a significant impact of the Delta variant. Boris Johnson will urge G7 leaders to “defeat Covid” by vaccinating the world by the end of next year. The prime minister will stress the importance of the programme when he meets leaders on Friday in Cornwall for the first face-to-face G7 meeting since the beginning of the pandemic. The US, France, Germany, Italy and Japan have all said how many doses they will donate to the global vaccine programme, Covax. However the UK and Canada are yet to announce how many they will contribute. Johnson will also call for a global watch system to catch new variants before they spread more widely. Johnson said: “I’m calling on my fellow G7 leaders to join us to end this terrible pandemic and pledge will we never allow the devastation wreaked by coronavirus to happen again.” Head of the UK vaccines taskforce Kate Bingham is to be given a damehood, the Telegraph has reported, after getting the UK access to millions of doses of six different jabs. Her expected honour is among a number in next week’s Queen’s Birthday honours dedicated to “heroes” in the pandemic. Bingham was appointed to the role in May last year and left at the end of 2020. People who have had both doses of a Covid-19 vaccine should have restrictions relaxed for them, according to former prime minister Tony Blair. Blair’s thinktank, the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, sets out how the country should remain open if the virus persists in the population. The report, Less Risk, More Freedom, says that the NHS app – which is currently used for contact tracing – should be replaced with a system of global health passes. “The health pass needs to be usable both by national border authorities and other organisations within countries. It should also include the ability to demonstrate time-restricted testing status for those who aren’t able to be vaccinated. “With this ability to securely prove vaccination status, we can move beyond blunt, catch-all tools and align with other countries by removing certain restrictions for the fully vaccinated – thereby enabling us to sustainably reopen the economy,” the report says.

Soon after, the regime revoked the publishing licences of five Yangon-based media outlets and more across the country. Soldiers raided newsrooms, including Kamayut Media, whose co-founder Nathan Maung – the other US citizen in Insein prison – <a href=\"https://myanmar-now.org/en/news/security-forces-raid-kamayut-media-office-in-yangon\">was arrested in a raid on 9 March</a>.

A month later, he left for an undisclosed location – just days before the military, known as the Tatmadaw, deployed deadly airstrikes where he had stayed in an apparent response to a KNU ground attack. Back in Yangon, his apartment was raided on 1 May.</p> <p>“My mother was alone at home,” he said. “Armed soldiers destroyed the front door and searched through some documents, but they couldn’t find anything because we had already moved them.”</p> <p>As a counter to the military’s North Korea-esque propaganda, Moe Myint says local outlets have come to rely heavily on freelancers and citizen journalists – and should pay them accordingly. The regime has reverted to the isolation seen during the decades of military dictatorship from 1962 to 2011, reintroducing a censorship board and a press council of junta affiliates, he says. “Further repression and the darkest days of Myanmar media are coming,” he added.</p> <h2>‘A gang of thieves and murderers’</h2> <p>This view is shared by Cherry Htike, 39, executive editor of Tachileik news agency, an outlet based in Shan state and which is banned by the junta.

Banning two independent news channels was among the general’s first actions, followed by a warning to local media not to use “incorrect words” such as coup and referring to the military as a “junta” or “regime”. Soon after, the regime revoked the publishing licences of five Yangon-based media outlets and more across the country. Soldiers raided newsrooms, including Kamayut Media, whose co-founder Nathan Maung – the other US citizen in Insein prison – was arrested in a raid on 9 March. He has reportedly been tortured. Maung founded a weekly newspaper for Burmese migrants in Thailand. He later moved to the US, where he studied at North Carolina State University and went on to found Kamayut Media in 2012 with two friends. The United States on Thursday reiterated its concern over the detention of Fenster and Maung, and called again for their release. A state department spokesman, Ned Price, said consular officers had conducted a virtual visit with Maung on 24 May and had sought to visit Fenster but the junta had not granted access. Safety is not guaranteed even for those journalists who do manage to flee. Three DVB reporters who illegally crossed into Thailand face deportation after a court sentenced them to a one-year probation period and fined them 4,000 baht ($128) each, Nadthasiri Bergman, a lawyer with the Human Rights Development Foundation, said. The trio’s lives could be in danger if they are sent home, said the lawyer – a possibility understood well by experienced reporters such as Moe Myint, 32, who stopped sleeping at home on day one of the coup. Already on the military’s radar because of an interview with an ethnic rebel in 2020, he says his worst nightmare is to be kidnapped by soldiers at night, tortured to death, and then his wife to be called to collect the corpse. “The military or any ruling political party in Myanmar regard journalists as their enemies, not the fourth pillar of democracy,” said Moe Myint, who fled Yangon after the office of Mizzima, one of his employers, was raided on 9 March. While his wife and two-year-old son sheltered elsewhere in Myanmar, Moe Myint joined another reporter on a tense journey to territory held by the Karen National Union (KNU), an ethnic armed group fighting for more autonomy on the border with Thailand. He shaved his head and wore spectacles, slipping past military checkpoints until they reached the region in late March. A month later, he left for an undisclosed location – just days before the military, known as the Tatmadaw, deployed deadly airstrikes where he had stayed in an apparent response to a KNU ground attack. Back in Yangon, his apartment was raided on 1 May. “My mother was alone at home,” he said. “Armed soldiers destroyed the front door and searched through some documents, but they couldn’t find anything because we had already moved them.” As a counter to the military’s North Korea-esque propaganda, Moe Myint says local outlets have come to rely heavily on freelancers and citizen journalists – and should pay them accordingly. The regime has reverted to the isolation seen during the decades of military dictatorship from 1962 to 2011, reintroducing a censorship board and a press council of junta affiliates, he says. “Further repression and the darkest days of Myanmar media are coming,” he added. ‘A gang of thieves and murderers’ This view is shared by Cherry Htike, 39, executive editor of Tachileik news agency, an outlet based in Shan state and which is banned by the junta. Her team reports daily on the crackdowns, the bombings and other vital local information, but they pay a heavy price. Soldiers stalk them, hoping to catch a colleague off guard. They succeeded on 13 May when a photojournalist was detained after returning from a safe house to his own home. “I worry for the safety of my team and myself every second,” she said. “Now uncertainty is a part of our life.” Advertisers disappeared after the coup, which the editor puts down to fear of military reprisals for associating with the outlet. “We are using our emergency fund and some aid but I’m not sure how long we can survive,” she said. Now on the run, Cherry Htike receives words of support from her US-based sister, a journalist who fled the former regime in 2008. She is also wary of public sentiment, which, although overwhelmingly opposed to the military since the coup, has previously turned against independent reporters. Two Reuters journalists, for instance, were labelled traitors by the majority of people – in line with the military’s narrative – and jailed in December 2017 for investigating the killing of 10 Rohingya Muslim men and boys by security forces and Buddhist civilians in Rakhine state. For the reporters who have chosen to continue working from inside the country, life is a minefield of danger and suspicion. A reporter, whose identity has been concealed due to the sensitivities, expected the coup would be bad “but the situation has become the worst it can be”, he said. He saw the mass protests of February in Yangon disintegrate into a bloodbath and colleagues remove their press helmets to avoid being targeted by security forces. He moved his wife and young daughter to a new neighbourhood, where he is pretending to be an IT technician. He has swapped his jeans and sneakers for a traditional longyi to avoid attention, and camera parts are hidden in his lunchbox when he tries to pass security points into areas of resistance. His wife quit her job at a broadcasting studio after it was occupied by the Tatmadaw and now he is the sole breadwinner, he says. His daughter looks set to miss another year of school after the pandemic, because of violence and a boycott of the education system under the junta. “Everything has been messed up by that crazy, stupid and shameless military coup,” he said. “Our lives are not safe; we have to worry for each other much more than ever. The junta military is no longer an army, it’s just a gang of thieves and murderers led by their gangster, Min Aung Hlaing.” Yet the journalist is determined to stay in Myanmar and continue reporting. Other civilians are taking up arms with the conviction that a hellish future – a full-scale civil war – is necessary to make way for a brighter path: removing the military from power, once and for all. Whether imprisoned, in hiding or leading double lives, the press in Myanmar is under no illusions. “Media here will die if they keep ruling,” he says.","charCount":"9426","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"Guardian reporter in Bangkok"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}

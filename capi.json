He ascribed to the view that pitches with something in them made for better bowlers as it put the pressure on the bowlers to deliver wickets and develop an attacking mindset rather than a defensive one. The good bowlers will find a way to take wickets on most surfaces if that’s the way that they set out to achieve.”</p> <p>That’s a really interesting angle – so much of sport, <em>and life</em>, is played in the mind.

Don’t know which site is best for scores so thought I’d email you. And much as I love Ireland, having the live stream on here while directing would probably be unprofessional...” Netherlands are 123-8 off 40, so Ireland are pretty well-placed. Good luck with the play! “Flatter pitches,” begins Mike Daniels. “Tom Cartwright would say that producing flatter pitches doesn’t produce better bowlers except in the sense that they become better defensive bowlers. He ascribed to the view that pitches with something in them made for better bowlers as it put the pressure on the bowlers to deliver wickets and develop an attacking mindset rather than a defensive one. The good bowlers will find a way to take wickets on most surfaces if that’s the way that they set out to achieve.” That’s a really interesting angle – so much of sport, and life, is played in the mind. I’m not sure I can buy it though, because you can’t win a Test bowling defensively on a flat track – you need to find a way to attack even with no help from the conditions. And another of looking at things might be that the good bowlers look to attack on every wicket. “On the subject of spreading joy,” emails Brian Withington, “all three seasons of the Detectorists are a delight but the last episode is simply wonderful. See also Marvellous, also with the impeccably life-affirming Toby Jones lead role. You’re welcome.” Someone pressed the Detectorists on me quite some time ago, and I sort of mentally filed it under whimsy. But if it’s worth a go, will have a look – and agree on Marvellous. Ian Ward reckons rain until about 2pm, then we should get a decent amount of cricket thereafter. “From his mouth to God’s ears,” as my Gran would’ve said. “G’day Daniel,” says Alistair Connor. “I’m thinking ‘Ha. England. Summer. Rain.’ But to be honest, you’ve got just as much of a chance of rain interruption in Auckland in December. Except that the rain is warmer. And it doesn’t last all bloody day.” What’s especially galling here is that in most of the country, they’re playing – even Old Trafford, for crying out loud. But hopefully we’ll get enough in today to make the next two days what they should be. In other what were you doing at 16 affirmation: I’m sure that when he’s not in the middle, he’s memorising every lyric and noise of Dummy. Oh, and one more: Musa Okwonga’s book, One of Them, achieves the difficult feat of being an easy read – it’s propulsive and entertaining – and a difficult read – it teaches you things about the world and about yourself that are upsetting. Find out more: Longtime members of our community will know that the OBO is not just for cricket but for the general sharing of joy, so allow me to recommend a couple of things that have enriched my recent life: Les Misérables – not the original, but the Ladj Li film on Netflix – is really, really worth your heart and mind. And, on an entirely different tip, American Barbecue Showdown has perhaps the most likeable cast of any reality show I’ve seen. Yeah, it’s still raining. No one has sent me any cake to stimulate conversation but we can pretend to the contrary; I’d love a school dinner-style treacle sponge. It’s interesting that Chris Silverwood has asked for flatter pitches this summer, so his bowlers get better at finding a way and his batsmen get better at occupying the crease. I guess we can add it to the IPL on our list of things about which KP was right, but otherwise that strikes me as good news for Jofra Archer and Mark Wood, whose pace becomes even more valuable. I also can’t wait to see how Branderson impose themselves just when we think that conditions are against them. Pivoting back to the match, Rory Burns will be delighted to have got a score here. I guess there’s a feeling that England’s top three aren’t quite cemented yet, Burns and Sibley good players who’ve not yet made the runs to waive stylistic concerns and Crawley seeking to bring his bottom level closer to his very acceptable top level. I hope all three do well this summer, but I’d absolutely love another look at Hasseb Hameed, and not just because of his luscious locks. “Since we’re on a hip-hop tip,” says George Browne, “Do you think today’s cloud will see the ball hooping around?” In the first hour, for sure, but at 60 minutes and one second? Who can say. The umpires are in the middle and the pitch is being uncovered, which is good I guess – though looking around and looking out my window, the weather does not scream “CRICKET!” There’s play in the champo pretty much across the country – they’re delayed at Trent Bridge and Canterbury, but going strong everywhere else. This country, eh? Anyhow, follow the action here: “Shame about this rain, eh,” laments Andrew Cosgrove. “I couldn’t agree more about the new stands, they look fantastic. When you bemoaned the loss of the toilets, I thought you were talking about my greatest grievance. I used to love the magnificent urinals at the Nursery End. I think they might have been Edwardian, acres of porcelain. The fact that the entrance and egress appeared to have been designed by someone who had given absolutely no thought to the most efficient way of getting hundreds of men in and out just added to the charm, somehow. I believe those toilets are no more, but it turns out you were talking about a different toilet.” I know your ones too, and yes, I agree – I like to believe that the small opening and vast expanse was a metaphor for opening a window into the soul. Anyway, how is learning every note of a classic album not more crucial than matrices, Great Expectations and the French idioms on page 175 of Tricolore? “Cruciality is relative,” philosophises Matt Dony, “and only truly understood when we can look back on a period and place it within a wider context. (My GCSE year, for example, was supposed to be ‘crucial’, and yet the fact that I wasted it learning every guitar note of Mellon Collie And The Infinite Sadness appears to have done no lasting damage). When taking about upcoming time periods, I would argue that we only ever have the potential for cruciality. The first hour’s play could be crucial. We won’t know until we’re looking back on it. And, anyway, time is a man-made construct, and nothing truly matters. Happy Friday, everyone.” That takes me back – I too did GCSEs in what graffiti around Golders Green and Camden Town knew as “Nutty 9T5”. I didn’t have the dexterity for guitar-playing, but did visit Virgin Megastore and ease open the plastic protecting various sheet music books, in order to copy down lyrics into my homework diary. Failing that, I would wait until my Walkman battery ran down and my tapes played slowly; who needs the internet? The rain doesn’t look “set in” but doesn’t look likely to disappear in the next bit. We’ve not been advised about a potential start-time which isn’t a great sign. Would it ever be possible to take, say, six weeks in the calendar and hold a Test-match World Cup? Last 16, last eight, semi-finals and final, one and done? I daresay I would watch it. The new Compton and Edrich stands look the absolute business, don’t they? I have reservations – boxes in the middle of the two tiers, sending the upper deck further from the action, less sun for those so inclined – but the view from the bottom looks so much better. Ultimately, you’ve got to credit the MCC in that every single ground improvement has been an absolute belter, on its own and as part of the whole. One minor tragedy, though, is the loss of the greatest toilets in the world – those were in the Warner, and featured a window which afforded members a view of the middle. It’s still raining, but that’s sort of good news. It means we should have play through all five days – and, as per the below, prospect of cricket is better than no cricket – on top of which, for those that can it’s worth investigating tickets for Sunday because there may be some. Tim Southee had a chat with Sky, discussing the inswinger he’s found and with which he dismissed Zak Crawley yesterday. It’s incredible really – how good he’s been without one – and how watching James Anderson can leave one taking such behaviour for granted “If the first hour is crucial, yet is lost to rain, does that hour remain crucial or does the next one take on that role?” wonders Phil Withall. “Does time lose its meaning if nothing happens during it or does it become more valuable for that reason? Do I need help?” These are the issues we’re here to tackle. I’m using my crucial first hour to debate the contents of my cool bag for tomorrow – did you know that Jews are forbidden from carrying on Saturdays, but if various posts are erected in the correct manner this no longer applies, and it’s now possible to do so all the way from Woodside Park to St John’s Wood, yes I will be making kiddush and hamotzi – but otherwise, I’m not sure. I would, though, like to know which are the uncrucial hours, and am certain that time is illmatic, keep static like wool fabric. Ah man, it’s so good to be back. Rain during cricket is somehow the best rain there is and the worst rain there is all at the same time. We’re looking at Joe Root, who may well hold the key to this Test.

Azarenka mistakenly thinks she’s served an ace at 30-30 but it’s called out. The second serve is long and the double fault gives Keys a break point but she hits a poor groundstroke halfway up the net, audibly giving herself a ticking off. Azarenka misses a first match point by going wide with a forehand and Keys hits a superb winner to save a second. But it’s third time lucky as another Keys error and an accurate serve down the middle from Azarenka seals a comfortable and deserved 6-2 6-2 victory. Azarenka, aided by a little luck at 30-15, holds serve to go 5-2 up. No margin for error now from Keys. Over on Court Suzanne-Lenglen, Federico Delbonis leads Fabio Fognini, the 27th seed, 5-4 in the opener and will be serving to win the set. Azarenka doesn’t wilt and survives some heavy Keys groundstrokes to reel off the next three points and take it to 30. The 15th seed leads 4-2 and is now just two games away from victory. Keys holds to reduce the deficit to 3-2 and now she’s 30-15 up on the Azarenka serve in the next. A change in momentum here perhaps. Keys gets a game back by winning the fourth but is still a break down at 1-3 in the second set against Azarenka. Thanks Luke. I’ll try and be the no-frills doubles partner that hogs the net and blocks a few back. Azarenka goes 3-0 up in the second, having won eight games in a row. Keys is not at the races. In the men’s singles, meanwhile: Alejandro Davidovich Fokina won his first set against Casper Ruud on a tie-breaker, but Ruud has just gone 4-1 up in the second set. And Federico Delbonis is 3-1 up on Fabio Fognini in their first set. Now, it’s time for me to hand over to David Tindall, and I’ll be back soon for the afternoon’s action ... Over on Philippe-Chatrier, Azarenka has broken Keys in the second and leads 2-0 after winning the first set 6-2. On Court 7, Zidansek and Siniakova are into a third and final set. Siniakova dominated the first set, 6-0, before Zidansek took the second set on a tie-breaker. All over. Pavlyuchenkova reaches the last 16 for the second time in her career - the last time she did so was 10 years ago. Sabalenka, in the second set, started to hit the ball in fearsome style and took it comfortably, 6-2. Pavlyuchenkova took a medical timeout - I am not sure what the problem was - and all the momentum that the world No 4 had built up seemed to disappear. However, Pavlyuchenkova played an excellent match, was far more consistent than her opponent, who produced a litany of unforced errors and is knocked out. At least Sabalenka will be able to say she took her shots on, and went down all guns blazing, even if blazing in accurately for the most part. Sabalenka edges to 30-30 with Pavlyuchenkova serving for the match. Can she strike back and find something in this third set? Azarenka wins the first set against Keys, 6-2. Break point for Pavlyuchenkova - and Sabalenka loses her composure again and crashes a big forehand very wide. It’s 5-0 in the deciding set, and surely, it’s all over. Now 4-0, as Pavlyuchenkova holds, and moves a step closer to the last 16. Sabalenka double-faults to kick off this service game, which she has to win to retain a slender chance of recovery. Deep trouble for Sabalenka, who now falls 3-0 behind in the third and final set. The precision of Pavlyuchenkova has been eye-catching in these past three games. Can Sabalenka, the world No 4, harness her power effectively once again as she did in that second set? Super stuff from Pavlyuchenkova, working her opponent around the court and fashioning the chance for a winner, and she has a chance to move 2-0 up in this decisive set ... which she does! Much as in the first set, frustration is creeping in for Sabalenka. Sabalenka makes it to 0-30 on her opponents serve, then nets a shot, much to her frustration. A brilliant volley from Pavlyuchenkova, on her toes, makes it 30-30 and now Sabalenka forces a break point. Azarenka has broken Keys, and leads 4-2 in the first. Pavlyuchenkova breaks! You have to wonder what the medical issue was. A cynic may suggest she simply took a few minutes out to try and stop Sabalenka’s momentum, which was looking unstoppable. Pavlyuchenkova is now back on court for the third set against Sabalenka. The No 3 seed is serving first in this deciding set. She double-faults twice to hand her opponent two break points. As suspected, that break for the medical timeout hasn’t done Sabalenka any good. Azarenka holds for 2-2 in the first set against Keys. Both have started the match well, both striking the ball sweetly, and looking pretty evenly matched in the rallies. Pavlyuchenkova has just walked off court for a medical timeout. If nothing else, that will interrupt Sabalenka’s rhythm: she was seeing it like a football in that second set, which she won 6-2. It’s with serve in the Azarenka v Keys match, at 2-1 to Keys, although it’s 30-30 on Azarenka’s serve now. In the battle of the Elenas, Rybakina has knocked out Vesnina, 6-1, 6-4. Sabalenka takes the second set, 6-2. Pavlyuchenkova simply couldn’t live with her opponent’s power and precision during that set. Sabalenka lacked precision in the first set, but has certainly found her range now, and there is going to be plenty of work to do for Pavlyuchenkova now. This is great to watch from Sabalenka, unless you are Pavlyuchenkova’s coach. Seemingly effortlessly she goes to 0-30 with a pass and a cleanly returned winner. And now to 0-40, three set points. The quality of Sabalenka’s hitting is looking more and more ominous for Pavlyuchenkova now. Sabalenka holds for 5-2, peppering her opponent with powerful groundstrokes, including one superb clean winner on her forehand side. Picturesque. An astonishingly good double-handed backhand return, which almost kisses the line right in the corner, creates two break points for Sabalenka. Pavlyuchenkova did not have a hope of getting close to that one. Sabalenka converts the first break point, and leads 4-2. She doesn’t over-celebrate, either, but looks quietly satisfied that her power hitting is starting to tell on the scoreboard. A comfortable Sabalenka hold for 3-2 in the second set. Meanwhile, Victoria Azarenka (15) and Madison Keys (23) are about to begin their third-round match on Court Philippe-Chatrier. Pavlyuchenkova, who is certainly looking the more consistent player, holds for 2-2. Sabalenka’s power is unstoppable when she gets it right, and she it not hesitating to attack, but she is also making too many errors in comparison with her opponent at the moment. Sabalenka puts away a forehand volley efficiently and holds comfortably for 2-1. Sabalenka has started this second set with renewed focus and is hitting the ball with serious authority compared to the second half of that first set. She goes on the attack to try and save a game point at 40-30, but sends a forehand wide, and it’s 1-1. Sabalenka holds serve impressively to open the second set, winning the first point with a cute drop-shot, and the second with another booming groundstroke to the baseline. Rybakina and Vesnina are now 2-2 in the second set, after Rybakina took the first 6-1. Over on Court 7, Katerina Siniakova took her first set against Tamara Zidansek 6-0, but Zidansek now leads 3-2 in the second. Pavlyuchenkova moves in behind a first serve and volleys decisively to take the first set, 6-4. It was very much a set of two halves, with Sabalenka sprinting out of the blocks and into a 3-0 lead. But a catalogue of errors by the Belarusian handed the initiative to Pavlyuchenkova, who won five straight games and sealed the set comfortably in the end. Unforced errors all over the place from Sabalenka. She dumps the first return of the game into the net, then sends a backhand long to gift Pavlyuchenkova a 30-0 advantage. Sabalenka holds, sealing the game with a big serve that was called out by a line judge. The umps leaves his seat to take a look at the mark, and rules it good. However, the Russian Pavlyuchenkova will now serve for the first set, at 5-4. A smart serve-volley from Pavlyuchenkova sees her save the break point, and she then takes the game for 5-3 in the first set. Sabalenka is clearly a bit frustrated with her game, and is occasionally venting her anger by winding up a huge forehand, or an unreasonably powerful second serve. Pavlyuchenkova attempts a delicate drop-volley which would put her 40-0 up on her serve, but places it fractionally wide. Sabalenka forces it to 30-30, and then absolutely destroys a brilliantly powerful forehand down the line for a break point. Much more like it from the Russian. Tennis - bloody hell! Pavlyuchenkova has now won four straight games and leads 4-3 in the first set. This one could get interesting. It’s 3-3 and all square in the first set between Pavlyuchenkova and Sabalenka. Sabalenka finds a couple of break points now, but the 29-year-old Pavlyuchenkova does well to bring it back to deuce in this sixth game of the first set. Our Eurosport commentator informs us that this is the 14th time Pavlyuchenkova has played at Roland Garros, which is quite a record. Sabalenka now saves a game point with a few massive groundstrokes that wear Pavlyuchenkova down with sheer force ... however, the Russian eventually finds a way. And now Pavlyuchenkova finds a break of her oppenents serve, and is right back in this first set at 3-2. Pavlyuchenkova is now on the board: it’s 3-1 in Sabalenka’s favour. Elsewhere, Elena Rybakina (21) now leads Elena Vesnina 5-0 in their first set. On Court Simonne Mathieu, Aryna Sabalenka (3) has raced into a 3-0 first-set lead against Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova (31). Sabalenka is the top-seeded player left in the women’s competition, following the withdrawals of Ash Barty and Naomi Osaka. The debate on Naomi Osaka’s withdrawal from this tournament rumbles on. Watch a video explainer, featuring the thoughts of our tennis reporter Tumaini Carayol, right here: Yesterday we saw Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Iga Swiatek, among others, progress safely to the third round at Roland Garros, while the women’s world No 1, Ash Barty, was forced to retire from her match against Magda Linette with a hip injury.

The Wall Street Journal say the moves are “ramping up regulatory scrutiny for the company in Europe”, adding: Both the European Commission—the EU’s top antitrust enforcer—and the U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority said Friday they are investigating whether Facebook repurposes data it gathers from advertisers who buy ads in order to give illegal advantages to its own services, including its Marketplace online flea market. Bloomberg has more details of the EU’s case: The European Commission said it will investigate whether Facebook misuses a trove of data gathered from advertisers to compete against them in classified ads. It will also check if the company unfairly ties its Marketplace small ad service to the social network. Friday’s move by the EU is the first time it’s escalated a case into Facebook’s behavior beyond the preliminary stages. It follows other high-profile cases targeting Google, Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. The EU previously fined Facebook for failing to provide correct information in the merger review of the WhatsApp takeover. Although the two investigations are separate, they were announced at the same time this morning. And both the UK’s CMA and the EC says they will “seek to work closely” together as these independent inquiries develop. Facebook says it will cooperate fully with both the EU and UK investigations “to demonstrate that they are without merit”. The social network giant explains: “Marketplace and Dating offer people more choices, and both products operate in highly competitive environment with many large incumbents”. We will continue to co-operate fully with the investigations to demonstrate that they are without merit.” Competition regulators in the UK and European Union have both launched investigations into Facebook, examining whether the social media giant is breaking competition rules. The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it will look into whether Facebook is abusing a dominant position in the social media or digital advertising markets, by using advertising data to gain an unfair advantage in the classified ads and online dating sectors. The CMA will examine if Facebook has unfairly used the data gained from its digital advertising services, and from its single sign-on service (Facebook Login), to benefit its own services. In particular, it will look at Facebook Marketplace (which runs classified adverts), and its dating profile service Facebook Dating. Andrea Coscelli, chief executive of the CMA, says the regulator will conduct a thorough investigation. “We intend to thoroughly investigate Facebook’s use of data to assess whether its business practices are giving it an unfair advantage in the online dating and classified ad sectors. “Any such advantage can make it harder for competing firms to succeed, including new and smaller businesses, and may reduce customer choice. Coscelli adds that the CMA will work closely with the European Commission... who have just announced their own antitrust investigation to assess whether Facebook violated EU competition rules. Again, the EC will examine if the tech giant used advertising data gathered in particular from advertisers in order to compete with them in markets where Facebook is active such as classified ads. The formal investigation will also assess whether Facebook has tied Marketplace to its social network, giving an unfair advantage in the online classified ads services and breaching the EU competition rules. It explains that online classified ads providers advertise their services on Facebook’s social network, while also competing with Facebook Marketplace. The EC says: Following a preliminary investigation, the Commission has concerns that Facebook may distort competition for the online classified ads services. In particular, Facebook might make use of the data obtained from competing providers in the context of their advertising on Facebook’s social network, to help Facebook Marketplace outcompete them. Facebook could, for instance, receive precise information on users’ preferences from its competitors’ advertisement activities and use such data in order to adapt Facebook Marketplace Competition chief, and executive vice-president, Margrethe Vestager, adds “Facebook is used by almost 3 billion people on a monthly basis and almost 7 million firms advertise on Facebook in total. Facebook collects vast troves of data on the activities of users of its social network and beyond, enabling it to target specific customer groups. We will look in detail at whether this data gives Facebook an undue competitive advantage in particular on the online classified ads sector, where people buy and sell goods every day, and where Facebook also competes with companies from which it collects data. In today’s digital economy, data should not be used in ways that distort competition.” Economist Richard Ramsey is also struck by the surge in construction costs - both for materials, and subcontractors: That last point suggests tradespeople are responding to the law of supply and demand, and pricing their time accordingly..... The UK building boom means that finding skilled construction workers is a real problem, says Duncan Brock, Group Director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply: “The construction sector continued its expansion programme with a phenomenal acceleration in growth and the strongest for seven years as new orders filled in at the fastest rate for almost a quarter of a century. Residential work was back in the top spot as house building rose at the quickest pace since August 2014, serving as an antidote to the recent scarcity in housing for lets or buy, and driven by consumer demand and a boost from the stamp duty holiday. “Busy purchasing managers were under pressure to keep up and buying up at the fastest rate since April 1997, changing sourcing strategies to find depleting essential materials and stocking up just as supply chain problems continued to mount along with prices. With inflation for goods and raw materials at a 24-year high, companies will be concerned that much-needed profits will be eaten away as building projects take shape and could be held up by some of the longest delivery times on record. Skills shortages are also becoming a problem, with recruiters finding talented labour hard to find, as job creation was at robust levels and the threat of staffing cutbacks has become a distant memory.” This chart, from the PMI report, shows just how badly supply chains are creaking: The surge in input price inflation is quite startling -- it’s being driven by soaring material costs, and shortages of stocks such as timber, roof tiles, paint, taps and concrete. UK building firms are hiring new staff at the fastest rate in seven years, to handle the surge in demand in May. New project starts and a sustained recovery in construction workloads resulted in the biggest jump in staffing numbers since July 2014, the PMI report shows. And with new orders flooding in, sub-contractor usage increased at a survey-record pace. UK construction has recorded its fastest growth in almost seven years, fuelled by the biggest jump in new orders since at least April 1997. The latest survey of UK construction shows that the sector benefitted from surging order books, driven by demand for new homes amid rising economic confidence. However, cost pressures are also at record levels, as builders scramble to find the raw materials and parts they need. That’s according to data firm IHS Markit, whose Construction PMI index has jumped to 64.2 in May, up from April’s 61.6. That shows very fast growth, and is the strongest reading since September 2014 (anything over 50 shows expansion). Markit says the UK construction sector is on a “strong recovery path”, with companies “highly upbeat” about growth prospects for the next year. New order volumes increased at the fastest pace since the survey began just over 24 years ago, while input cost inflation also hit a survey-record high during May. Business confidence among builders also jumped sharply, due to “resurgent customer demand”, and optimism about the UK economic outlook following the successful vaccine roll out. Markit reports: House building (index at 66.3) was the best-performing category of construction activity in May, followed by commercial work (64.4) The latest increase in work on commercial projects was the steepest since August 2007, reflecting strong demand conditions following the reopening of customer-facing areas of the UK economy. Civil engineering activity (index at 61.3) also increased sharply during May, although the pace of expansion eased slightly since the previous month. Tim Moore, Economics Director at IHS Markit, says supply chains are struggling to cope with this rapid output growth, and the surge in new orders to the highest in at least two decades. “There were widespread reports citing shortages of construction materials and wait times from suppliers lengthened considerably in comparison to those seen during April. Imbalanced supply and demand led to survey record increases in both purchasing prices and rates charged by sub-contractors. Despite severe challenges with materials availability, construction firms remain highly upbeat about their near-term growth prospects. Nearly two-thirds of the survey panel forecast an increase in output during the year ahead, while only one-in-thirteen forecast a decline. UK car sales continued to recover from their pandemic lows last month, but remain below their pre-Covid level. A total of 156,737 new cars were registered last month -- a jump of 674% compared with May 2020, during the first lockdown. This follows the reopening of car showrooms, and the relaxing of some pandemic restrictions in April and May. But, the market has not yet returned to normality. Sales are 14.7% lower than in May 2019, and over 13% below their average for the month over the last decade. And so far this year, car registrations are around 29% below their average levels. Sales to companies to businesses or organisations grew more than twice as fast as private purchases in May. These ‘fleet sales’ made up around half of all new vehicles hitting the road last month, totalling 79,435 sales -- ten times higher than a year ago. That shows improving business confidence, says the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said: “With dealerships back open and a brighter, sunnier, economic outlook, May’s registrations are as good as could reasonably be expected. Increased business confidence is driving the recovery, something that needs to be maintained and translated in private consumer demand as the economy emerges from pandemic support measures. Demand for electrified vehicles is helping encourage people into showrooms, but for these technologies to surpass their fossil-fuelled equivalents, a long term strategy for market transition and infrastructure investment is required.” So far this year, plug-in vehicles have accounted for 13.8% of new car registrations, up from 7.2% a year earlier, with plug-in hybrids (PHEV) growing fastest. Fully electric cars have made up 7.5% of sales this year, with pure petrol engines still around half the market. The Covid-19 restrictions on touring and performing are also encouraging artists to cash in the value of their music rights, points out John Coldham, IP partner at law firm, Gowling WLG. Here’s his take on the sale of Joel Little’s song catalogue to Hipgnosis: The trend to buy up the rights to songs continues, with this latest investment being a continuation of that. There is nothing new about rights to creative works being bought and sold, but it is interesting that, as the world evolves into digital streaming, there has been a spate of such high profile sales recently. It is likely that some artists wish to realise the value of their catalogue now, rather than wait for the trickle of streaming revenues to come in, especially as they are not able to perform live so easily in the present environment. These sales demonstrate the value of intellectual property, and ensuring its ownership is properly documented will assist in realising that value later. Music news: Grammy Award-winning songwriter, producer and musician Joel Little has become the latest musician to sell their works to Hipgnosis Songs Fund. Little has worked with several leading musicians - including Taylor Swift, and Lorde, co-writing and producing her debut EP and her first album, Pure Heroine’. The sale of Little’s musical catalogue comes amid the boom in streaming under the pandemic. Several other big music names have also taken this move; Hipgnosis have recently signed deals with the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Neil Young, Fleetwood Mac guitarist Lindsay Buckingham, and Barry Manilow, along with Metallica and Michael Bublé producer Bob Rock. Reuters has more details: Little, whose songs Hipgnosis says have been streamed over 15 billion times, co-wrote and produced four songs on Swift’s 2019 album “Lover,” including “Me!” and “The Man”. He has also collaborated with U.S. R&amp;B singer Khalid, and in 2014 won a Grammy award with New Zealand singer Lorde after co-producing and writing “Royals”. In 2014 Little co-wrote or produced songs for the “The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 1” movie. The catalogue totals 178 songs, Hipgnosis said in a statement, and between 2017-2019 earned revenue of $8.6 million. It did not disclose the size of the deal. With airlines under pressure, the London stock market is effectively becalmed this morning. The FTSE 100 index has dropped by 10 points, or 0.15%, to 7054 points while the more UK-focused FTSE 250 is flat. Traders are keeping firmly to the sidelines ahead of May’s US jobs report -- to see whether hiring bounced back, and whether wages are rising (cue more fretting about inflation). Connor Campbell of SpreadEx explains: Analysts’ estimates have the nonfarm number climbing to 645,000 [from 266k in April], with the unemployment rate falling from 6.1% to 5.9%. Average hourly earnings are, as ever, the one outlier, with expectations of 0.2% against the previous month’s 0.7%. Considering that nonfarm forecast lies somewhere between the levels expected last month, and the number produced last month, it will be interesting to see how investors react. It might hit that sweet spot – strong enough to point to a continuing recovery, but not strong enough to prompt any action from the Fed. Although the travel sector is clearly struggling, the wider UK economy is rebounding from the pandemic. Overnight, a survey has shown that British employers took on permanent staff last month at the fastest rate since at least the late 1990s. There was also a rush for short-term staff, with temporary staff placements growing at the fastest in six years, according to the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) trade body and accountants KPMG. Kate Shoesmith, REC deputy chief executive officer, said. “We now have a consistent picture over the past few months to show that confidence is growing and hiring plans are in motion.” The survey also found that companies are struggling to hire staff, due to pandemic uncertainty and fewer candidates from the EU. And that drove starting salaries rose last month, at the fastest rate since September 2018 -- in a boost to workers. Shoesmith said: “With demand spiking, the skills and labour shortages that already existed in the UK have come into sharper focus – and COVID has only made them worse.” AJ Bell financial analyst Danni Hewson says the UK’s new tighter travel restrictions are causing ‘aftershocks’ in the travel sector today: “The travel sector continued to see aftershocks from yesterday’s earthquake decision to remove Portugal from the green list of travel destinations from the UK. Hopes of anything approaching a normal summer for the industry now look pretty much over. “Domestically the hospitality sector will be hoping that a full reopening is still on the cards for the 21 June but creeping concern about the threat posed by the Delta variant may send any decision on this to the wire – which is clearly exceptionally unhelpful for businesses.” Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Travel stocks are sliding this morning after the UK government removed Portugal from the “green list” of countries exempt from significant travel restrictions, The decision to move Portugal to the amber list is a major blow to the airline sector - just weeks after the UK lifted restrictions on international flights. It has prompted warnings of a deepening crisis for aviation, with unions urging the ministers to provide more support. The move was bitterly criticised by the tourism industry, which had been hoping for more countries to be added to the ‘green list’, meaning passengers wouldn’t need to quarantine on their return. So the news that Portugal will moved to Amber on June 8th, while seven countries, including Egypt and Sri Lanka, are now on the “red list” of destinations that require hotel quarantine, has jolted the sector. Jet engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce, whose engine servicing business is dependent on planes racking up flying hours, are down almost 2.5% this morning, the biggest faller on the blue-chip FTSE 100. Shares in British Airways-owner IAG have dropped another 1.5% in early trading, adding to their 5% slide on Thursday as the Portugal news emerged. Travel stocks are also among the fallers on the FTSE 250 index, with budget airline easyJet dropping by 1.5% (it also fell 5% yesterday). Wizz Air, which warned this week that it would make another loss unless restrictions were eased, are down 2.5%. In Dublin, Ryanair have dropped another 1%. The move has also hit the cruise sector, where Carnival are down 2%. Yesterday’s selloff wiped around £2bn off travel stocks, as the prospect of revenues from Portugal trips faded. Transport secretary Grant Shapps blamed concerns of a new coronavirus mutation and rising cases for the move; although Portugal called the decision ‘unfathomable’. Airlines hit out at the plan, with EasyJet’s boss, Johan Lundgren, saying: “The government has torn up its own rulebook and ignored the science, throwing people’s plans into chaos, with virtually no notice or alternative options for travel from the UK. This decision essentially cuts the UK off from the rest of the world.” Unions are also concerned about the move, with prospect general secretary Mike Clancy warning that the industry risks losing ‘half of the summer’. “This news today is further evidence of the instability facing the aviation industry this summer. With government advice shifting regularly it is imperative that proper financial support for the sector is put in place. “Even in the most optimistic scenario, we now face losing half of the summer before holidaymakers can confidently book travel to major destinations, and the nearer we get to the school holidays the more likely they will be to just stay at home. Given the uncertainty, Clancy adds, the government must consider doing more to help the sector - or risk seeing travel firms collapse - pushing up unemployment. “The government starts phasing out its lifeline furlough scheme in four weeks’ time which is only adding to the damaging uncertainty facing aviation. Ministers need to make clear that further support will be available to support jobs while restrictions on tourist travel remain in place. Without this, there’s a risk that the industry will no longer be there when restrictions are lifted.” Also coming up today Investors are bracing for the latest US jobs report, the Non-Farm Payroll, which will show whether hiring in America recovered in May after slowing in April. Economists predict around 650,000 new hires last month, up from 266,000. A jump in employment would clearly be very welcome, as the US economy is still missing eight million jobs since the pandemic. But a stronger-than-expected NFP could also jolt the markets, intensifying concerns about inflation- and the possibility that central bankers end their stimulus programmes. Ricardo Evangelista, senior analyst at ActivTrades, explains: The narrative in the markets has been dominated by the risk of high inflation becoming a collateral effect of the ongoing gargantuan stimulus. The Fed has, so far, refused to blink, insisting that any spikes in prices are likely to be temporary and that bringing forward the tapering could damage the economic recovery. Amidst this tug-of-war, employment is likely to become a decisive factor, with a high reading having the potential to force the Fed to start thinking about tapering its current monetary and asset purchase policies. Looking at today’s dollar gains, it appears that many investors are already positioning themselves for such a scenario. G7 finance ministers are meeting in the UK for two days of talks, where they will try to hammer out a landmark deal to end tax avoidance by multinationals and big technology companies using tax havens to exploit loopholes in the global system. The UK and Norway are close to signing a trade deal, with a formal announcement expected as soon as today. UK sources have told City AM that the deal could could cut Norwegian tariffs on British agricultural exports, like beef and cheese, and provide more access to Norwegian fish imports to the UK.

She said: We owe it to kids to keep cases low &amp; protect their education. The latest ONS data on infections has been released and show there has likely been an increase in the percentage of people testing positive for coronavirus in most areas of the UK. In England, the percentage of people testing positive for coronavirus has increased in the week ending 29 May 2021. The ONS estimates that 85,600 people within the community population in England had Covid-19, equating to around 1 in 640 people, which is up from about 1 in 1100 last week. This is the highest level since the week to April 16. In Wales, there are early signs of an increase in the percentage of people testing positive in the week ending 29 May 2021 where the estimate is that 2,900 people in Wales had COVID-19, equating to around 1 in 1,050 people. In Northern Ireland, the trend in the percentage of people testing positive is uncertain in the week ending 29 May 2021. The ONS estimates that 2,300 people in Northern Ireland had Covid-19, equating to around 1 in 800 people. In Scotland, the percentage of people testing positive has likely increased in the two weeks up to 29 May 2021, however, the trend is uncertain in the week ending 29 May 2021. The estimate shows that 7,700 people in Scotland had Covid-19 equating to around 1 in 680 people. In the week ending 29 May 2021, the data analysts have seen an increase in cases in England that are not compatible with the UK variant B.1.1.7 (labelled Alpha by the World Health organisation); these are likely to be the variant B.1.617.2 (known as Delta), first identified in India. In the week ending 29 May 2021, we have seen an increase in cases that are compatible with the UK variant B.1.1.7 (WHO “Alpha”) in Wales. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has approved the use of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine in 12- to 15-year-olds. The MHRA said the decision follows a “rigorous review” of safety and effectiveness in that age group. Dr June Raine, MHRA chief executive, said: We have carefully reviewed clinical trial data in children aged 12 to 15 years and have concluded that the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine is safe and effective in this age group and that the benefits of this vaccine outweigh any risk. We have in place a comprehensive safety surveillance strategy for monitoring the safety of all UK-approved Covid-19 vaccines and this surveillance will include the 12- to 15-year age group. No extension to an authorisation would be approved unless the expected standards of safety, quality and effectiveness have been met. It will now be for the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) to advise on whether this age group will be vaccinated as part of the deployment programme. More than 2,000 children were involved in the clinical trial to determine the safety of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, the chair of the Commission on Human Medicines said. Prof Sir Munir Pirmohamed said: We have been very careful to take into consideration the younger age group and the benefits of this population being vaccinated against any potential risk of side-effects. There has been a thorough assessment and review of this data which was also looked at specifically by the CHM’s Paediatric Medicines Expert Advisory Group who are scientific experts within this age group, as well as the CHM’s Covid-19 Vaccines Benefit Risk Expert Working Group. We have concluded that based on the data we have seen on the quality, effectiveness and safety of the vaccine, its benefits do outweigh any risk. The MHRA will continue to scrutinise all of the suspected side-effects data received through the rigorous surveillance programme in place through the Yellow Card scheme and other safety surveillance measures for all of the Covid-19 vaccines used in the UK. Over 2,000 children aged 12-15 years were studied as part of the randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trials. There were no cases of Covid-19 from seven days after the second dose in the vaccinated group, compared with 16 cases in the placebo group. In addition, data on neutralising antibodies showed the vaccine working at the same level as seen in adults aged 16-25 years. These are extremely positive results. Britain’s medicines regulator said on Friday it had extended approval of the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech so it can be used on 12- to 15-year-olds. Dr June Raine, the chief executive of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, said: We have carefully reviewed clinical trial data in children aged 12 to 15 years and have concluded that the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine is safe and effective in this age group and that the benefits of this vaccine outweigh any risk. She added it would be up to the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation to decide whether this age group would come under the vaccine deployment programme. First Minister Mark Drakeford said Wales’s coronavirus restrictions would continue to ease if the growing number of cases of the Indian variant was not leading to increased pressure on hospitals. He told PA Media: It’s not risk-free, that strategy, because that assumes that there will be greater circulation of the virus in the community and when you allow coronavirus to circulate the opportunities for new variants emerging increase as well. But if the link between falling ill and needing to be treated in hospital is broken, then it will mean that in the future we will have to find ways of living with coronavirus more like the way we live with the seasonal flu. Drakeford said part of the reason he was pausing further easing of Wales’s rules for three weeks was due to evidence the variant was causing greater hospital admissions among young people. He said: The considerable majority of those people are people who have not been vaccinated, but amongst their number are people who have received the vaccine. That’s why the advice we have is that two more weeks of evidence really will be very helpful to us in understanding better where this new variant is having its impact. One of the UK’s leading scientists has called on the prime minister to donate 20% of the UK’s Covid vaccines to other countries in an effort to try to save lives and stem the spread of coronavirus variants. The head of the Wellcome Trust, Sir Jeremy Farrar, and the executive director of Unicef UK, Steven Waugh, have published an open letter to Boris Johnson appealing for the UK to set an example ahead of the G7 summit in Cornwall, which begins in a week’s time. UK science played a core part in “breathtaking advances” that have enabled vaccines to be developed, which is the way out of the pandemic, they say in their letter. They write: At home, the UK vaccination rollout has been a phenomenal success and has already saved countless lives. Yet, globally too many countries still lack doses to protect healthcare workers and the most vulnerable. As president of the G7, the UK has the opportunity to set the standard for global action on sharing doses. Three months ago, you proudly pledged that the UK would share vaccines with the world. Now we ask that you turn this pledge into reality. Read the full story here: Prevalence of self-reported long Covid was greatest in people aged 35 to 69 years, females, those living in the most deprived areas, those working in health or social care and those with another activity-limiting health condition or disability, the ONS found. There is no universally agreed definition of long Covid but it covers a broad range of symptoms such as fatigue, muscle pain and difficulty concentrating, PA Media reports. Fatigue (weakness or tiredness) was the most common symptom reported as part of individuals’ experience of long Covid up until 2 May (547,000 out of 1 million people), followed by shortness of breath (405,000), muscle ache (313,000) and difficulty concentrating (285,000). The Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, said he had wanted the UK to wait longer before its original decision to put Portugal on the green list because coronavirus figures showed it was only “marginally” qualified for that status. Drakeford told PA Media: The figures showed that while Portugal was in a position to be put on the green list, it was only marginally so. I would have waited a bit longer to see whether that position was strengthening so that you can be confident that it would be on the green list, or whether because it was so close to the margin things could have moved against it being on the green list. Now things have deteriorated in Portugal and I know that will be a very significant challenge now for people who are already on holiday there to face quarantining when they return. An estimated 1 million people in private households in the UK reported experiencing “long Covid” in the four weeks to 2 May, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Of these people, an estimated 869,000 first had Covid-19 – or suspected they had Covid-19 – at least 12 weeks previously, while 376,000 first had the virus or suspected they had the virus at least one year ago, PA Media reports. Long Covid was estimated to be adversely affecting the day-to-day activities of 650,000 people, with 192,000 reporting that their ability to undertake day-to-day activities had been limited a lot. Cristóvão Norte, Portuguese MP for the Algarve, said he is “perplexed” by the British government’s decision to remove Portugal from the green list. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: We were not expecting the decision because there haven’t been major changes in Portugal, just a spike in the Lisbon area. But we have 66 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. Our rate of transmission is more or less the UK rate, so we weren’t expecting this decision from the English government. We wear masks, we obey the rules, we maintain social distancing, vaccination is growing steadily. So I’m a little bit perplexed. Norte added: I have to respect the decision. We would like to know sooner. This causes great uncertainty. He said it is “a huge blow” on the economy, adding that the country heavily depends on British tourism. Julia Lo Bue-Said, chief executive of travel agent group Advantage Travel Partnership, said the decision in relation to Portugal was “an absolute devastating blow” for consumers and the industry, PA Media reports. She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: It now throws confidence completely out of the window. It puts the industry in a really difficult position and consumers in a difficult position in order to be able to plan effectively. Tim Hawkins, chief strategy officer at Manchester Airports Group, which owns Manchester, Stansted and East Midlands airports, claimed the government “isn’t willing to take any risk at all”, and urged ministers to “trust in the traffic light system”. He told Times Radio: For people coming back from green countries you have to take a pre-departure test, you have to take a test when you come back. There is not a free flow of people coming back from those countries. There are safeguards, there are measures in place to control those kinds of things, but the government seems to have ignored those. Portugal is not the only country that has moved on the traffic light rating system. Afghanistan, Bahrain, Costa Rica, Sudan, and Trinidad and Tobago have also been placed on the red list, meaning people arriving in the UK from those nations must stay in a quarantine hotel for 11 nights. The changes come into effect at 4am on Tuesday. The Delta variant of coronavirus, first discovered in India, is anywhere between 30% to 100% more transmissible than the previously dominant Alpha (or Kent) variant, according to Prof Neil Ferguson, whose Covid modelling was key to the UK’s first lockdown. Ferguson is a leading epidemiologist at Imperial College London who advised the government at the beginning of the pandemic. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “We’re certainly getting more data. Unfortunately, the news is not as positive as I would like in any respect about the Delta variant. The best estimate at the moment is this variant may be 60% more transmissible than the Alpha [Kent] variant. “There’s some uncertainty around that depending on assumption and how you analyse the data, between about 30% and maybe even up to 100% more transmissible.” It comes as the date of lifting lockdown approaches, with 21 June the proposed time when the government will remove “all legal limits on social contact”, although some social distancing and mask-wearing rules will remain. Read the full story here: Here’s a clip of Prof Neil Ferguson talking about the potential easing of restrictions on 21 June. He says the Delta variant may be 60% more transmissible than the variant first identified in Kent and it is doubling across the country “about every nine days”. Robert Jenrick said there was still “nothing at the moment that suggests that we won’t be able to move forward” with the next stage of lifting restrictions on 21 June. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: We’ve got a further 10 days until we are going to make that decision on or around June 14, so during that period we’ll see where are we with hospitalisations, with deaths, where are we with the vaccine rollout – we’re doing everything we possibly can to expedite that – and then at that point, we’ll make our final decision. Asked whether measures such as wearing masks and working from home could continue after 21 June, Jenrick told the Today programme: Well, there are options that are clearly available to the government. We set out within the road map what would be expected to happen at the next stage and we want to try to stick to that if we possibly can. All of us are moving everything we can to achieve that. But of course, we keep these things under review and we’re also asking people to continue to exercise caution in their daily lives. Communities secretary Robert Jenrick insisted a watchlist, where countries at risk of moving from the green to amber list are placed, is still an option. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: The watchlist system remains, if it’s possible to do that. If you’re seeing that cases are gradually rising, that positivity is increasing, then one may be able to use that and if you can, obviously it’s preferable to do so because you want to give people and the industry that forward guidance. But if you’re seeing new variants or versions of variants emerging, you may need to act more swiftly, and I think that is the right thing to do. First minister Mark Drakeford has said he believes Wales is “right to be concerned” about the Delta variant of Covid-19. “It is spreading very quickly in the north-west of England, right on our border,” Drakeford told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. We know it’s more transmissible. There is some evidence that it is driving more people into hospitals. Drakeford said the country’s chief medical officer had advised on Thursday that Wales should “phase in” its move to alert level one over the next three weeks. He said a cluster of cases of the Delta variant in Llandudno was believed to be “under the control” of public health teams in the area but 300 people were self-isolating as a result of it. He said: We’ve had examples in schools and in workplaces in that part of Wales and our caution is grounded in what the science is saying to us about the potential impact of that new variant more widely in Wales. Dame Irene Hays, owner of travel agent Hays Travel, said she was “surprised and obviously disappointed” to hear of Portugal’s move off the green list for travel from the UK. She told Sky News: [I’m] disappointed for our customers, disappointed for the travel industry and really disappointed for Portugal, because they’ve tried so hard and their infection rates are so low. I know they’re rising in Lisbon, but it’s quite a way from the Algarve, which is where most of the tourists are. Asked if she felt that nuance had not been taken into consideration, Hays said: It would be nice if it was a nuanced approach, but we are where we are. It is “difficult” and “very frustrating” for holidaymakers, particularly those who had just started their trips, she added. While some people are still booking holidays for the summer, Hays said the “vast majority” are instead booking for autumn or 2022. Moving Portugal off the UK’s green list is “an overreaction”, an epidemiologist in the popular holiday destination has said. Prof Henrique Barros, the president of Portugal’s National Health Council, said the overall situation in the country is “relatively stable”. The communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, said positive cases had doubled in the last three weeks in Portugal. Barros told Sky News: We didn’t reach such an increase, except as I said in a specific area around Lisbon. The overall picture in the country, we didn’t reach such figures. Asked about Portugal being moved to the amber list for travel, he said: I think it’s an overreaction. But of course you know that people moving from one country to the other, it’s obviously a risk for both countries, of course. We know that we should pay attention to the situation. He said it is mainly people aged under 40 and 30 where a rise in infections is being seen, and that with people over 50 “we have a very, very low incidence of cases”. The health chief said hospital admissions at the present time are “very low”, at less than 25 people per million, while those in intensive care are at less than five people per million. Barros stressed that officials in the country “pay a lot of attention” to monitoring the virus. Robert Jenrick said he did not know how many cases there were of the new Nepal variant of the coronavirus. Speaking to the Today programme, the communities secretary said it appeared to be a “further mutation of the Indian variant”. When asked how the Nepal variant could be used as a reason to remove Portugal from the green list if he did not know how many cases there were, Jenrick said: We have seen that there are cases of it, they are picking this up, and we took the decision that it was better to be cautious whilst we learn about this new mutation of the variant. Jenrick said he was not aware of any cases of the Nepal variant in the UK. He said Portuguese scientists had detected the variant, but said: What we don’t yet know is how prevalent it is in Portugal – but more importantly than that, whether this really is a significant problem. You could, of course, wait whilst we do that research and then, God forbid, we learn that it is very virulent, that it does compromise our vaccines, or we can take a safety-first approach. He was also on BBC Breakfast defending the decision to add Portugal to the amber list, saying “it’s right to be careful”. The communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, said the decision not to move Portugal off the green list until Tuesday meant people could travel home in an “orderly” manner. He told BBC Breakfast: We think it’s sensible to give people a period of time to return home to the UK. As I say, they’ve got until Tuesday to do so, that’s designed to help people to come back in an orderly manner, to not see scenes at airports where people are crowded together. There are risks involved in creating that sort of situation. We have taken a cautious approach by taking Portugal off the green list, putting it back onto the amber list, and I think that’s the right thing to do to protect the public. Prof Neil Ferguson said most people in hospital with the virus have not had a vaccine. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today Programme: It’s important to say that most people being hospitalised at the moment with this variant, and with any Covid variant, are unvaccinated. So, it’s clear that the vaccines are still having a substantial effect, though it may be slightly compromised. He said they are still waiting for data on how much the Delta variant can evade the immunity which protects people against being admitted to hospital. He said: The data being reported relates to unvaccinated people, so if you haven’t been vaccinated there appears to be, both from Public Health England data and from Public Health Scotland data independently, about a twofold increased risk of hospitalisation. Professor Neil Ferguson said he thinks the data is “pointing this week in a more negative direction than it was last week” and that it would be a “very difficult judgment call” when asked about whether the 21 June lifting of restrictions needs to be delayed. The epidemiologist and former government adviser told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: First of all, it’s not my job to make that decision, thankfully. I think the data is pointing this week in a more negative direction than it was last week, so it points towards the direction of being cautious. I think balancing, clearly, people’s desire – and there clearly is a built-up desire to get back to normal – against the potential risk is a very difficult judgment call. Welcome to today’s liveblog.

I was very close to it a few years ago, then I released that we were close to the 100th anniversary so I thought I’d wait, and this is the horse I waited on. The anniversary [of MacSwiney’s death] was the day after he won [the Group One Vertem Futurity] at Doncaster [in October].” Bolger will not be travelling to at Epsom on Saturday but his daughter Una – whose husband, Kevin Manning, has been the trainer’s stable jockey since 1993 – will be there to collect the prize should Mac Swiney prevail. It is the family business, after all, and Bolger shows no sign of easing himself into the slow lane any time soon. “I have really good staff and I’ve had them down the years, some of them have been here a very long time,” he says. “And I’ve told them that I’ll keep going as long as I can and they’re very happy with their positions, so it’s working well from their point of view and also from my point of view. And my family are happy enough for me to continue being the risk-taker that I’ve always been.”","charCount":"4764","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/gregwood\">Greg Wood</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"}]}}

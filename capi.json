Today, all things being equal, England will draw their third consecutive Test at home for the first time since the late eighties. And though that’s mainly down to the weather, it also reflects a different approach and a greater resilience under Chris Silverwood. The Bayliss-era England might have thrown the towel in when they slipped to 140 for six; instead, Rory Burns and Ollie Robinson (with bat and ball) stalled New Zealand’s momentum to such an extent that they finished the day crawling along at two an over.</p> <p>New Zealand will resume on 62 for two, a lead of 165. With a maximum of 98 overs to bowl, they could still force victory on a pitch is becoming more uneven. But with a forecast for showers – of the meteorological rather than the middle-order kind – that looks unlikely. Madame de Stael said that one must choose in life between boredom and suffering. England politely request a boring last day.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-06-06T10:24:03.480Z\">at 11.24am BST</time></p>  </div>","wordcount":"2849","firstPublicationDate":"2021-06-06T09:04:15Z","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2021-06-06T11:47:42Z","liveBloggingNow":"true","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/p/hy2q7","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/6cabfe7e5cfcc64689dfadd74251f59773b44665/0_174_3711_2227/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","isLive":"true","bodyText":"52.3 overs: New Zealand 166-6 (Watling 15, de Grandhomme 9) de Grandhomme pulls Anderson up and over for four. With New Zealand in one-day mode, I’m surprised England aren’t using their only white-ball bowler, Mark Wood. Not that it matters for now because the rain is getting heavier and the umpires have decided to take an early lunch. 52nd over: New Zealand 162-6 (Watling 15, de Grandhomme 2) The new batter Colin de Grandhomme gets off a pair by whapping a full toss for a single. New Zealand lead by 265. “Good morning Rob,” says Adam Roberts. “Your mention of Stuart B on Courtney Walsh’s knee immediately put me in mind of one of my favourite photos. My very young daughter, all golden curls and cherubic features, sitting on Michael Holding’s knee - completely oblivious to who he is - attacking him with a giant foam finger. “Which ties in nicely with today. Unexpectedly awake from 4am. I made the most of it by switching on the cricket at 5. First up is the mellifluous voice of Mikey H, explaining his late arrival at the Test because of the problems of getting out of Cayman to the UK (he had to fly through the States) - something my family is currently struggling with.” Henry Nicholls walks. He missed a reverse sweep at Root and gloved the ball into the off side, where Burns ran forward from slip and swooped to take a fine low catch. 51st over: New Zealand 159-5 (Nicholls 23, Watling 14) Some light rain is falling at Lord’s. Play continues for now, though the umpires could decide to take an early lunch. “Is it just me,” says Mark Steward, “or does Ollie Robinson look like the secret lovechild of Freddie Flintoff and Steve Harmison?” He reminds me more of Harmison when he bats, though he’s obviously more accomplished. I suppose there are many worse lovechildren to resemble. 50th over: New Zealand 157-5 (Nicholls 22, Watling 13) Root hurries through another over, and why not. 49th over: New Zealand 156-5 (Nicholls 22, Watling 12) Watling edges Anderson for four, which takes New Zealand’s lead to 259. There are still a maximum of 79 overs remaining; I’d imagine they will given England a target of around 310 in 67 overs. 48th over: New Zealand 151-5 (Nicholls 22, Watling 7) Root continues. Nicholls swipes him over mid-on for four and then misses a huge slog-sweep. Had he connected with that, no outdoor brunch on St John’s Wood High Street would have been safe. New Zealand lead by 254, and I’m starting to wonder whether England are sleepwalking into a horror movie. 47th over: New Zealand 144-5 (Nicholls 16, Watling 6) Or maybe Root came on so that Anderson can change ends, which is what he has just done. One from the over. “Finding the endless moaning about over rates on telly and radio increasingly irritating,” says Andy Moore. “Why can’t we just accept that in the modern game bowling 15 overs per hour isn’t feasible (what with reviews, drinks breaks etc)? Is there any other sport that places more importance in the time of day than the amount of play to be completed? Looking forward to the Ryder Cup concluding at 6pm sharp with America 1/2 point ahead and Justin Rose 4 up with 5 to play. Really grinds my gears.” I can see both sides of this argument. I find it hard to angry about slow over-rates, but then I haven’t paid however much to get into the ground. Your point is a good one, that there are more natural interruptions nowadays, concussion checks and the like, but equally 12 overs an hour is pushing it. Maybe 14 per hour is a more realistic target, I don’t know. 46th over: New Zealand 142-5 (Nicholls 15, Watling 5) Joe Root replaces Anderson, perhaps with England’s inadequate over-rate in mind. Five from the over. “In cryptic crossword circles, the process which you just have described about de Stael (ie divining the existence of something highbrow from something distinctly lowbrow) is known as ‘Ninja Turtling’,” says Tom Adam. “It stems from, ‘Of course I’ve heard of Donatello. He’s the one with the purple mask.’” That’s a good phrase, I hadn’t heard of that. Also, David Chase would like to discuss your description of the Sopranos as ‘distinctly lowbrow’. It’s okay, he’s in a good mood. 45th over: New Zealand 137-5 (Nicholls 11, Watling 4) I thought they might promote Colin de Grandhomme for some bish-bosh, but BJ Watling is the new batter, and he gets going with an emphatic cut for four. That was a useful cameo from Taylor: 33 from 35 balls with one four, two sixes and a comprehensive range of fresh-air shots. “Kudos to Michael Keane for not venting spleen on anyone else (the pandemic aside) for his mis-ticketing episode,” says Ian Copestake. “I wish him a very tasty lunch.” I hope it’s not egg and bacon. Ross Taylor’s eccentric innings comes to an end. He chases a deliberately wide delivery from Wood and snicks it through to Bracey, who takes a nice low catch to his right. 44th over: New Zealand 132-4 (Taylor 33, Nicholls 10) Jimmy Anderson comes on for Stuart Broad, and Taylor survives a very good-looking LBW shout. The umpire Michael Gough thought there was an inside edge, but the two noises were actually the ball hitting both pads. England have wasted all three of their reviews; had they been able to go upstairs, Taylor would have been out. “Just re-emerging from your Cricinfo link/wormhole in the 34th over,” says Jim Crane. “That 1989 Australia tour itinerary - madon! Six Tests, visits to all the counties, and then casually rounding it off with two bilateral series against Netherlands and Denmark! Imagine rocking up to an ICC board meeting in 2021 with that proposal.” It’s great isn’t it. They played a county game the day after they regained the Ashes, and the stand-in captain Geoff Marsh chose to bat first on a green mamba because, in his words, “the boys are all still pissed”. 43rd over: New Zealand 126-4 (Taylor 30, Nicholls 7) An extraordinary shot from Ross Taylor, who slogs across the line at Wood and top edges the ball high over third man for six. Taylor is so dangerous that, despite middling almost nothing, he has raced to 30 from 31 balls. “Morning Rob,” says Michael Keane. “I’m heading home from Lord’s where, on arrival at the Grace Gate, it transpired that my ticket was for yesterday. Woe is me. As a newly minted member I had thought my days of ticket tragedies were over. But for now even those of us bedecked in egg and bacon need to book a seat. Bloody global pandemic... Looks like it’s the OBO and TMS for me today then. Maybe I’ll make lunch for my better half or something. Feck.” This is mildly heartbreaking, and extremely funny. (I say that as the kind of airhead who does things like this all the time.) 42nd over: New Zealand 118-4 (Taylor 23, Nicholls 6) Nicholls goes into one-day mode, walking down the pitch to slice Broad high over the slips for four. Broad replies with another big inswinger - too big, this time, as it veers away for four leg byes. New Zealand have scored 56 from 12 overs this morning; they lead by 221. “If Friedrich Nietzsche was on comms,” says Ian Copestake, his eyebrows unintentionally betraying the extent of that if, “Zak Crawley’s cover drive would be a cue for his line that, ‘Art is the supreme task and the truly metaphysical activity in this life.’” 41st over: New Zealand 109-4 (Taylor 23, Nicholls 1) Mark Wood replaces Ollie Robinson (14-5-26-3) and beats Taylor with the first and last deliveries of the over. Two runs from it. “The 2000 Code of the Laws of Cricket was the first to use ‘fielder’, instead of ‘fieldsman’,” says Alan Tuffery. That’s interesting; I expected it to be much earlier than that. 40th over: New Zealand 107-4 (Taylor 22, Nicholls 1) That’s Broad’s 518th Test wicket, which puts him one behind Courtney Walsh, the man whose lap Broad used to sit on when he was a kid. Imagine the eight-year-old Broad’s face if you told him they would both end up with 500 Test wickets. After a mildly scandalous amount of misfortune, Stuart Broad finally gets his first wicket of the match in his 38th over. Latham, beaten the ball before, is hit on the back leg by a big inswinger bowled from wider on the crease. Michael Gough gives it out and, though Latham reviews, it’s hitting enough of leg stump for the original decision to stand. 39th over: New Zealand 106-3 (Latham 36, Taylor 22) Taylor misses another disgusting mow across the line at Robinson. But then he finally nails the shot, pinging Robinson over midwicket for a huge six. He is always dangerous, even when his bat seems to have no middle. “Hi Rob,” says Pete Salmon. “Who remembers The Professionals? We’ve been watching Bodie and Doyle at ours as our lockdown treat – just started the final series and already mourning getting to the end. Two very nice moments for OBOers recently. One, Bodie playing club cricket, moving rapidly through the nineties with a series of pull shots, and then getting bowled for 97 after being distracted by a call to duty (followed by getting changed out of his whites in the back of a speeding car, as we’ve all done at some stage). And then in last night’s episode, Doyle having to pretend he’s an intellectual. Bodie: ‘Can you keep the patter up?’ Doyle: ‘Of course, I read the Guardian.’” I’m now desperate to know what Arthur Daley made of our esteemed rag. 38th over: New Zealand 97-3 (Latham 35, Taylor 14) “Excellent Guardianista preamble reference to the French-Swiss Anne Louise Germaine de Staël-Holstein,” says Brian Withington. “She almost invented the Guardian strap line with the phrase ‘Search for the truth is the noblest occupation of man; its publication is a duty’. Apparently she is also quoted as saying, ‘The more I see of man, the more I like dogs’, so something for [redacted] readers, too.” While I’d love to flaunt my education, and perhaps explore what Nietzsche’s philosophy can tell us about Zak Crawley’s cover drive, I only know the Madade de Staël quote because Meadow mentions it in the Sopranos. 37th over: New Zealand 93-3 (Latham 34, Taylor 11) Taylor doesn’t look remotely comfortable against Robinson. He is beaten outside off stump, edges short of the slips and then hacks desperately across the line for a couple of runs. Robinson smiles at Taylor with contempt and then has a big LBW appeal turned down when Taylor misses another smear. England was their last review - it hit him miles outside off stump. That wasn’t great captaincy from Joe Root. But it was a brilliant over from Robinson, which concludes with another play and miss by Taylor 36th over: New Zealand 91-3 (Latham 34, Taylor 8) “The last day of the match will not be so drab if Ross Taylor and Colin de Grandhomme can come in and smash Anderson and co. to make a hundred-odd runs in 90 minutes,” writes Gangesh. “Chasing 300-plus in 70 overs will enthuse England, and their aggression could provide the Kiwi bowlers opportunities. So that’s a possibility Kane Williamson can explore to inject some interest in the game - provided, of course, the notorious English weather stays fine!” A repeat of the last day in 2015 would be all kinds of fun. 35th over: New Zealand 87-3 (Latham 33, Taylor 6) England would love to get Taylor early as he is somebody who can score quickly, as he shows with a cracking extra cover drive for four later. Robinson pulls his length back as a result and rips one past the edge. Lovely response. “Has anyone seen a split screen of Ollie Robinson and Josh Hazlewood bowling?” says Gary Naylor. “The more I see of the Sussex bruiser, the more I think of the Australian err... bruiser.” Hazlewood’s a bit quicker, isn’t he? But otherwise it’s an excellent comparison – forensic accuracy, sharp bounce, seam movement and a hint of malevolence. 34th over: New Zealand 81-3 (Latham 32, Taylor 1) There’s an urgency to New Zealand’s batting that wasn’t evident last night, so perhaps my assumption of a draw was premature. I can think of one precedent in particular. But it’s really not easy to score quickly on this pitch. Broad beats Latham with a stunning delivery and then has him dropped by Crawley at midwicket, a sharp two-handed chance to his right. Broad has had no luck at all in this game. “I can live with batter,” says Adrian Goldman. “What I can’t live with is that in science, sulfate is now the expected spelling, not sulphate. Beyond dismay: pretty much the end of civilisation as we know it.” I’ll see your sulfate and raise you T20 scorecards that have dot balls instead of maidens. It’s cultural vandalism. What the hell is 2-4-12-1 supposed to mean? 33rd over: New Zealand 80-3 (Latham 32, Taylor 0) In the history of Test cricket there have been 3,054 debuts, but none quite look Ollie Robinson’s: 42 runs, seven cheap wickets and a public shaming. He loses his line at the end of the over, spearing a delivery down the leg side for four byes. James Bracey was pretty gutted that it wasn’t called a wide. A third wicket for Ollie Robinson. Wagner, roughed up by a couple of good short balls, top-edged a hook miles in the air and was calmly caught by James Bracey. 32nd over: New Zealand 72-2 (Latham 31, Wagner 10) Stuart Broad gets a chance to bowl at Neil Wagner, who dismissed him yesterday and celebrated with a red-faced flourish. Broad appeals for LBW first ball, but it was going down on the angle. Wagner then cracks two boundaries, a flash up and over the cordon and a majestic flick through midwicket. I’d love to hear Broad’s internal monologue right now. “This fuss comes up regularly,” says John Starbuck. “’Batter’ is, agreed, both an Americanism (by way of the English invention of baseball) and a flour, milk and egg mixture. But think what might happen if we used ‘bowlsman’ as a standard. If we can do it with one essential element of cricket, we can do it with the other. Besides, look at the ambiguities of ‘pitch’ and ‘wicket’, which vary a lot depending on context. Language is meant to be fluid.” Test Match Special overseas link Here you are. 31st over: New Zealand 62-2 (Latham 30, Wagner 2) Ollie Robinson will open the bowling, a reward for his forensic excellence last night. He switches over and round the wicket to Latham, giving him precisely no opportunities to score. Thus, it’s a maiden. “The OED has instances ‘batter’ being used in relation to cricket going back about 200 years, so it’s not like it’s without precedent,” says Andrew Cosgrove. “Also, you don’t talk about a ‘bowlsman’ do you? Anyway, do you think England are capable of batting out two sessions for a draw?” I do, I do. A collapse wouldn’t shock me but I think it’s unlikely, especially as there are likely to be one of two rain interruptions. This is a majestic piece from Andy Bull, with a particularly brilliant intro. “I am becoming more &amp; more dismayed by the use of the term ‘batter’ in cricket,” says Ben Carter. “All the commentators are doing it. The term is BATSMAN. Are you all coordinated by someone who tells you what to say?” Yes, last month Mother Cricket gave her 475 children a collective brollocking for our sexist terminology. Seriously, though, with everything else that’s going on in the world right now, is a change of language designed to increase inclusivity really worthy of dismay? I can understand thinking it’s a bit heavy-handed, not that I’d necessarily agree, but dismay, I can’t have that. The draws are back in town. Today, all things being equal, England will draw their third consecutive Test at home for the first time since the late eighties. And though that’s mainly down to the weather, it also reflects a different approach and a greater resilience under Chris Silverwood. The Bayliss-era England might have thrown the towel in when they slipped to 140 for six; instead, Rory Burns and Ollie Robinson (with bat and ball) stalled New Zealand’s momentum to such an extent that they finished the day crawling along at two an over. New Zealand will resume on 62 for two, a lead of 165. With a maximum of 98 overs to bowl, they could still force victory on a pitch is becoming more uneven. But with a forecast for showers – of the meteorological rather than the middle-order kind – that looks unlikely. Madame de Stael said that one must choose in life between boredom and suffering. England politely request a boring last day.","charCount":"16219","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/robsmyth\">Rob Smyth</a> (now) and <a href=\"profile/timdelisle\">Tim de Lisle</a> (later)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/live/2021/jun/06/azerbaijan-grand-prix-f1-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-06T11:46:07Z","webTitle":"Azerbaijan Grand Prix: F1 – live!","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2021/jun/06/azerbaijan-grand-prix-f1-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2021/jun/06/azerbaijan-grand-prix-f1-live","fields":{"headline":"Azerbaijan Grand Prix: F1 – live!","standfirst":"<ul><li>Live updates as Hamilton looks reclaim championship lead</li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/jun/05/charles-leclerc-pips-lewis-hamilton-to-azerbaijan-pole-in-crash-strewn-session\">Saturday: Leclerc pips Hamilton to dramatic pole</a></li><li>Get in touch! <a href=\"mailto:alex.hess@theguardian.com\">Email Alex</a> or <a href=\"http://twitter.com/a_hess\">tweet him</a></li></ul>","trailText":"<strong>Lap by lap report:</strong> Can Lewis Hamilton reclaim the world championship lead from Max Verstappen at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix?

But that works nicely for us because we now get to enjoy a decider. Azarenka 7-5 3-6 Pavlyuchenkova Badosa, meanwhile, saves two break-back points in fine style – she runs onto the ball beautifully and addresses it with power before clinching the set with a lob. Excellent work from her – she looks comfortably the superior player now. Azarenka plays a miserable game to hand Pavlyuchenkova three break points and she saves two really well ... but a very tight double ruins her good work; Pavlyuchenkova will now serve for the second set. Azarenka gets to 30-all in Pavlyuchenkova’s next service game but a pair of decent first serves snuff her out. Meanwhile, Badosa is well on top now, and at 15-40 Vondrousova hauls a forehand wide so that she’ll now serve for the first set at at 5-4. “After last night’s match, Federer said he wasn’t sure if he would play his fourth round match against Berrettini,” emails James Ferguson, “citing the fact that there is not a week off in between the French Open and Halle, where he has committed to playing. Following his lead, do you reckon I can get away with emailing my Swiss boss for a week off before our next big meeting?” I’m not sure a week is sufficient to ensure adequate preparation. Badosa is getting the measure of Vondrousova now, picking her drops and such – they’re at 3-3 – while Azarenka has recorded the fourth straight break in her match with Pavlyuchenkova so now trails 2-3 having won set one. And the Azerbaijan land of fire GP: Also going on: the final day of England v New Zealand which might just yield a positive result. Badosa breaks back immediately with the help of a double fault, while Pavlyuchenkova has broken Azarenka again to nudge in front in set two. Vondrousova’s composure is working better than Badosa’s power, and she’s just broken for 3-1. Excellent from Pavlyuchenkova, who breaks immediately in set two ... then finds herself playing deuce as she tries to consolidate. A banging forehand down the line gives Azarenka a chance to resolve things, and a really tame backhand hands her the game. Azarenka 7-5 1-2 Pavlyuchenkova A lot of people are high on Badosa, and I can’t wait to see how she does against the wily lefty behaviour of Vondrousova. Vondrousova 1-0 Badosa Azarenka is struggling here, Pavlyuchenkova sticking away at backhand at the net for a break-back point ... only to net a backhand return. But she quickly arranges another opportunity ... then spurns it, and Azarenka punishes her, upping the aggression to clinch the set principally via forehand. Azarenka 7-5 Pavlyuchenkova And there it is: Paylyuchenkova spurns various game points then tamely nets a backhand, giving Azarenka a third break of the set. She’ll serve for it in 90 while, on Lenglen, Vondrousova and Badosa are out for what should be a decent tear-up. Great news. I absolutely love Halep, and can’t wait to see her play again – we’ve missed her here. Azarenka holds easily for 5-5, and I’d not be surprised to see her break in the next game. Pavlyuchenkova started this match playing pretty much as well as she can and will be perturbed to have nothing to show for it. Still, though Azarenka has improved since then, she’ll now serve to stay in the set. Azarenka 4-5 Pavlyuchenkova Wikipedia informs me that Badosa’s favorite shot is the serve. Lovely stuff. On Chatrier, they’ve swapped breaks again; Azarenka is serving at 3-4 down. Next on Lenglen, it’s that match I mentioned below; will power and aggression of Badosa be too much for the canny, skilful Vondrousova? That’s a brilliant win and performance from Zidansek, who reaches her first Grand Slam quarter. She hung tough when she need to, then opened her shoulders at the key moments; if she keeps it up, she’ll have plenty for whichever of Vondrousova [20] or Badosa [33] she meets next. Zidansek goes wide with a forehand down the line, handing Cirstea a point to claw back one of her two breaks; again, she finds a really good serve that allows her to make deuce, and seconds later she has her first match point.... Azarenka breaks back and is starting to hum; behold Pavlyuchenkova’s behind-ear tatt. On Lenglen, Cirstea has struggled through a hold, forcing Zidansek to serve for it at 5-1. Pavlyuchenkova now leads Azarenka by a break, 3-1, while Zidansek powers through a hold that includes her first ace of a match that doesn’t have long left. At 0-5, Cirstea will now serve to stay in the competition. Zidansek has hit a vein at precisely the right time, and from 40-15 she works a point for a double break, thanks in part to a double on deuce; she takes it, and suddenly this match is nearly over. Zidansek 7-6(5) 4-0 Cirstea On Chatrier, Azarenka and Pavlyuchenkova have swapped breaks in their first two games while back on Lenglen, Zidansek does indeed get her break; she arranges three opportunities and takes the second, a lovely backhand down the line sealing the deal. Cirstea is in trouble. Zidansek 7-6(5) 2-0 Cirstea A loopy forehand drops long and suddenly, from 30-0, Zidansek is 30-40 – a terrific serve out wide quickly draws her level again, but Cirstea unloads some vicious forehands to earn a second break point; Zidansek saves it and then another before closing out. She’s played the big points well and that’s why she’s in front; I’d not be surprised to see her break in the next game. Zidansek 7-6(5) 1-0 Cirstea Again it’s Zidansek with the mini-break and at 3-5, Cirstea doesn’t have long to resolve it ... and she has even less time now, racing to the net, but when the ball’s banged at her she can only deflect it wide. Three set points it is, and though Cirstea saves the first with yet another winner, she then sends a forehand wide. That’s a tough set to lose because she was the better player; other hand, she’ll feel confident she’s got the game to win form here. Zidansek 7-6(5) Cirstea Cirstea seems to be hitting it a bit harder than Zidansek, on a regular and on special occasions, a barrage of blows – the last of them a sensational forehand cross-court on the run – putting her in front. Before the match I fancied Zidansek, but that power differential is significant – for as long as Cirstea’s radar is operational. And there we go – she bangs a forehand down the line but catches the ball a little late, wiping it just wide. But she retrieves the mini-break immediately with some lovely hands and balance at the net. Zidansek 6(3)-(3)6 Cirstea Cirstea gets 0-15 and will be vexed that she then nets a forehand return that drops into the slot. But she makes Zidansek play a low backhand right on the baseline that falls long, and the aroma of opportunity will be wafting through her nostrils. Zidansek, though, is having no such thing, her lateral movement on-point and facilitating a forehand winner punished down the line for 40-30. She can’t close out though, and Cirstea saves a succession of game-points on advantage before another backhand winner - there’ve been a few – raises her first set-point. Zidansek, though, delivers a gorgeous, nerveless forehand winner down the line – then another – and this is developing into a really good tussle. A big service winner down the middle, and we’ve got that breaker. Zidansek 6-6 Cirstea Excellent from Zidansek, rattling through an easy hold, but then Cirstea does likewise and we might be just moving to that elusive point of both players playing well at the same time; if Zidansek can muster one more hold, we’ll get to examine that premise in a breaker. Zidansek 5-6 Cirstea Cirstea holds to 30 – Zidansek is getting closer – but in 90 seconds she’ll serve under pressure, and who knows how that’ll pan out? Zidansek 4-5 Cirstea Looking down the rest of the day’s play, Tsitsipas v Carreno Busta stands out – as does any match featuring the Greek musketeer – but Azarenka v Pavlyuchenvoka and Serena v Rybakina could also be good. Zidansek and Cirstea are at different stages of their careers, the former 23 and the latter 31. But they’re a really good match for each other based on what we’ve seen so far, with Cirstea looking to have settled faster – she’s hitting beautifully from the back and showing decent enterprise at the net. Zidansek 3-4 Cirstea Chatrier Azarenka [15] v Pavlyuchenkova [31] Tsitsipas [5] v Carreno Busta [12] Williams S v Rybakina [21] Zverev [6] v Nishikori (night match) ** Lenglen Zidansek v Cirstea Vondrousova [20] v Badosa Garin [22] v Medvedev [2] Davidovich Fokina v Delbonnis Tamara Zidansek and Sorana Cirstea – both unseeded – swapped breaks in the first two games of their fourth-round match before Cirstea held.

It be Peter Siddle, with Compton gone for 8. And an email whisks through the air from Romeo: “Hampshire need 459 to win. I wonder what the highest chase total set has been in CC history?” A quick google seems to suggest that Middlesex chased 472 to beat Yorkshire by seven wickets in May 2014, with Chris Rogers unbeaten on 241. At last! Bartlett gets his hundred, Somerset pass 400 and Hampshire have a challenge. Hampshire need 459 to win. Here, 20 year old Ali Orr nestles to his fifty! With a pull down to fine leg , another Sussex half century on debut Paul Edwards tells me that since August 1 last year, Sussex have given first-class debuts to nine players in 13 games. To compare, in the BWT, Lancashire gave first-class debuts to six players. Siddle and Sam Cook with the new ball at Chelmsford; Compton and Slater just have to bat it out for some plump points for a draw. Michael Duggan asks the question: “Really don’t understand why Somerset haven’t declared – over 400 ahead on the final day. Any thoughts? Might be waiting for Bartlett to get 100 but seems very strange to jeopardise your chance of winning the match.” We were just mulling that over in the Headingley press box. Equally puzzled. They must really rate the Hampshire batting line-up, I guess. Some great livestream stats for the RHF trophy. Add the 589,000 youtube and facebook views for the Roses match last week, and a lot of people are watching a lot of cricket. Now then. So Essex are all out for 210, trailing Notts by 293. If this was last year, you’d put money on Harmer to bowl Notts out for under 100. But in 2021, the Notts-up has become something of an endangered species, and Harmer has lost his cloak of invincibility. And another! With the third ball of his morning spell, Van Zyl feathers Thompson through to Duke and has to trudge, eyes firmly on the grass back to the dressing-room. A golden duck. Sussex 60-2. A top edge! A bit of extra bounce from Bess and Tom Haines sends the ball up and into the paws of Adam Lyth. The end of a partnership of 60 between the openers, Sussex 60-1. A wicket at Chelmsford! Shane Snater is lbw to Brett Hutton for his 200th first-class wicket. Essex 195-9. Sussex pottering along much untroubled here at Headingley, which will please Lancashire no end. Ben Stokes will make his boom-back at Chester-le-Street on Friday in the T20 game against Yorkshire. Did Darren Stevens read the memo? Darren Stevens doing Darren Stevens things, pincering Emilio Gay lbw for 8, Northants 14-1. Adam Lyth gets just the one over before Dom Bess is thrown the ball. A real opportunity for the scruffy scamp today, though on a pitch that didn’t much spin yesterday. Jack Carlson, who has just been given a contract extension by Sussex, did manage to extract some turn and bounce with the wickets of Malan and Ballance. What is this sorcery? Kent have declared on their overnight 330-5: which gives Northamptonshire a second innings lead of 62 runs. Some old-fashioned declaration bowling hangs in the air. Adam Lyth bowls the first ball of the day, from the Emerald Stand end. A Sunday sprinkling of spectators, Orr and Haines the men charged with steadfast blocking. Dawid Malan , who I’m reliably informed played a perfectly-judged innings yesterday, driving particularly well before being out for 199, spoke engagingly last night: “ I’ve tried to learn from my failures at Test cricket and put that into practice in four-day cricket. “Since 2019, I think my record speaks for itself in just having that fearless approach in four-day cricket and backing my technique and way of playing.

But in an indication of Hancock’s likely approach when he is quizzed by the same parliamentary committee on Thursday, he argued that Cummings had not in fact accused him of wrongly claiming tests were already being done in March last year – only that they would happen when testing capacity was available. Eradicating Covid-19 from the world is not currently a “reasonable target”, a World Health Organization Covid-19 official has said. Dr David Nabarro, a special envoy to the WHO, said people will have to learn to live with the disease, comments which were echoed by Dame Anne Johnson, a professor of infection disease epidemiology at University College London (UCL). Nabarro told Sky News’ Trevor Phillips on Sunday: “Humanity is going to have to learn how to co-exist with this virus, preventing it from spiking and then surging and causing hotspots of disease, and we’re going to have to be able to do this for the foreseeable future. “Eradication is not currently a reasonable target for the world.” He said: “Each time there is a sudden surge, it does stimulate in one’s mind the thought that there might be a new variant appearing. That wouldn’t be surprising.” He said that will be “the pattern for the future”, adding: “This virus isn’t going away any time soon, there will be variants emerging.” A Dublin pub landlord has said the hospitality industry in Ireland faces difficulties replacing staff who left during the pandemic. Kevin Barden, whose family owns the traditional Irish music pub O’Donoghue’s, told PA Media he has been fortunate to welcome back 19 of his 20-strong team after 15 months of closure. Others have struggled to recruit staff and are finding it hard to fill roles ahead of reopening. “We’ve only lost one for the moment and hopefully we’ll get him back by the end of the summer. So we’ve been lucky enough – we’ve retained the majority of the staff here, which has been great.” Like so many workers across Ireland, the staff have received an income through government Covid-19 wage subsidy support. “They’ve obviously had to take a hit and they all have families and mortgages and bills to pay as well,” said Barden. It’s a month tomorrow since Public Health England published a report on the India variant in the UK when there were 509 identified cases. Since then the case numbers in the country have risen 20-fold and case numbers are continuing to rise. This thread from PHE expert Meaghan Kall on where things in England are now is well worth a read: Countries in the Asia-Pacific region are looking to develop their home-grown vaccines as supply shortages threaten efforts to tackle the pandemic. Japan, South Korea, India, Taiwan, Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam are hoping to develop their own jabs after struggling to get vaccines from overseas, according to the South China Morning Post. While locally developed vaccines aren’t likely to affect the pandemic in its current phase, they believe it’s a better long-term approach. Germany has registered 2,440 new cases in the last 24 hours, and 24.7 cases per 100,000 people, according to the country’s Robert Koch Institute. The latest figures show 74 more people have died from the virus, meaning the death toll now stands at 89,222. There has been a total of 3,700,367 positive tests for Covid since the start of the pandemic. The new Delta variant of coronavirus appears to be about 40% more transmissible than the variant it has largely replaced, Matt Hancock has said, making government decisions about whether to ease restrictions in England on 21 June “more difficult”. Saying that under-30s will be called to begin vaccinations from next week, the health secretary confirmed it was still possible the reopening programme could be delayed or some rules kept in place. “We consider all options,” he told Sky News. Away from the UK, Russia has reported 9,145 new Covid-19 cases and a further 399 deaths. A total of 5,117,274 people have tested positive in the country. The death toll in the country now stands at 123,436. Russia’s own state statistics service, Rosstat, keeps its own records and said on Friday that about 270,000 people had died from the virus and related causes as of April. Excess deaths in the county stand at 425,000 from between April 2020 and April 2021. Marr rounds off by asking whether the health secretary regretted using the phrase about a “protective ring” around care homes. “I said that much later about what we were doing for the winter plans, but it’s been interpreted,” he says, but changes the subject on to the return of children to school tomorrow after half-term. “On testing, tomorrow schoolchildren will be going back to school. You must get tests done this evening because right now secondary school-age children getting their tests done tonight is the most important thing that can be done today.” Marr asks whether Hancock will apologise for any failings on his part during the pandemic, as Cummings did. “At that time everybody was working as hard as possible to protect as many lives as possible on the evidence we had at the time,” he says. “This is true of different administrations and across the whole of Europe. “I know those decisions were taken on the best evidence with the best of intentions.” Marr ends by asking whether Hancock’s been honest and transparent during the pandemic after claims made by Dominic Cummings during his select committee appearance last week. He plays a clip of Cummings saying that in March 2020 Hancock said people would be tested before they went back to care homes and there was a protective shield around them. “It’s complete nonsense,” Cummings said. He asks Hancock whether he told Johnson that people would be tested before they went into care homes. He replies: “We know the testing wasn’t available to test everybody. The advice was that very few people would be able to pass on Covid if they didn’t have any symptoms, so we reserved that for people with symptoms. “The situation with regards to care homes, we brought in a policy of wanting to test everybody going into a care home as soon as we had those tests available. Everyone had a challenge around Europe, in Scotland in Wales, some of the most vulnerable to Covid live in care homes, but at the time, you’ll remember we didn’t have the testing capacity and I built that up, put in place the hundreds of thousands targets and then we could put that into place.” On the idea of children being vaccinated, Hancock says the government is following clinical advice. “There’s good advantages, there’s the reduction in transmission from children to parents and grandparents who might be vulnerable. There’s advantages in protecting education, if one child gets one positive test, the whole bubble has to isolate. “We should follow and listen to clinical advice … I don’t want to put pressure on them with their advice. People should be reassured that whatever steps we take they are on a clinically advised basis.” In response to a question about vaccine passports, or certification along the lines mentioned by Tony Blair, Hancock says: “We know some other countries are going to require it. So if you want to go some other countries, you already have to, the EU are talking about it. It’s my job to make sure you can have that. “If you download the NHS app right now and register it will show you your vaccine status, so you can prove it if you want to go to Greece, for example.” He says rules in the UK are down to a certification review and that there is downsides on a mandatory basis. Hancock repeats Sage’s findings that the India variant is 40% more transmissible. In turn Marr quotes a Sage report saying that a variant of that level of transmissibility would cause severe disruption to the roadmap. Hancock says: “We’re watching the case rates and the rate in which that transfers into hospitalisations. Thankfully that link, which was absolutely rock solid over the autumn, is severed but not broken. There are some people in hospital who have been double vaccinated, but very few. The majority in hospital haven’t been. “Critically, those who are double vaccinated, even if they’re in hospital, they appear to be less ill. The vaccine is working and is our way through it, the new variant, which is more transmissible is making that calculation harder.” Matt Hancock’s now appearing on Marr, after his earlier interview on Sky News’ Trevor Phillips on Sunday. He first responds to an earlier interview by Bob Geldof calling for more vaccines to go to developing countries. The health secretary references Boris Johnson’s call to get the planet vaccinated by the end of 2022, and the rollout of the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab at cost to low and middle income countries. The cut to the aid budget, he says, is supposed to be temporary. “We also have this enormous cost there, so we can continue investing in the NHS, which we are doing, but there’s many things we are doing, leadership on climate change and certainly the work that AZ and Oxford University have done that a quarter of the vaccines across the whole world are delivered with UK taxpayers cash, at cost, no charge on intellectual property, and that’s saving lives everywhere.” Nandy backs vaccination for children after the JCVI’s approval of the Pfizer jab for 12-15 year olds. “I think the regulator has been clear that for 12-year-olds and over the Pfizer vaccine is safe and it’s apparent that the rise in transmission rates is being driven by young people. “It’s right to follow the public health officials particularly the ones that are saying ‘this is what we want to do’. “If public health directors are saying ‘we’ve got a problem in our secondary schools and we need to open up the vaccine, not to make it mandatory, offer the chance to get them vaccinated’, then we need to listen. If we’d taken that approach from the start we’d be in a far better place now.” On international travel Nandy says she believes the current Amber list for international travel from the UK should be scrapped. Current rules mean people travelling to the UK from those countries must quarantine at home or the place they are staying for 10 days and take two Covid tests during that period. She adds: “It’s confusing and that confusion is dangerous at the moment and risks unravelling all the progress that we’ve made. “I think we should have robust quarantine measures for people coming back into the country. “We need to be much clearer that at the moment travelling overseas, particularly when you’ve got countries like Vietnam and Thailand on the amber list where new variants are emerging and being imported into the UK, is the wrong thing to do and the government ought to be clear about that.” Labour’s shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy tells Marr says she’s sceptical on a domestic level on vaccine passports. “I think the global case for vaccine passports is clear because other countries are doing it, but at a domestic level for many of the reasons that you’ve highlighted, discriminatory practices, how they would be enforced, I think there are potentially real problems.” Here’s more detail on the proposal put forward by the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change. People who have been vaccinated against Covid-19 should be able to travel abroad using a new digital pass and go to “vaccine-only” venues such as restaurants or sports stadiums, Tony Blair says today. Releasing a report entitled “Less Risk, More Freedom”, by the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, the former prime minister says the time has come “to distinguish for the purposes of freedom from restriction between the vaccinated and unvaccinated”. The report argues that to date, measures intended to reduce the spread of disease have treated populations as largely homogenous groups. As a result, restrictions – such as national lockdowns, regional-tier systems and entire schools closed following outbreaks – have been blunt instruments. Tony Blair’s on BBC One’s Andrew Marr Show. He says he thinks it’s “uncertain” as to whether the UK will carry on with rules being relaxed on 21 June. Marr says that with introducing vaccine passports or certification status, it will end up discriminating against people who have not had the jab. Blair replies: “Discrimination has got a very loaded meaning in the English Language now. Really when it comes to risk management it’s all about discrimination. The reason we vaccinate the elderly first is that they are more at risk. The reason we ensure people are vaccinated is that we reduce the risk of transmission.” In response to a follow-up question, the former prime minister adds that there needs to be exemptions made for certain groups, including the disabled, as it would be “totally inappropriate” to discriminate against them. Taiwan reported 343 new Covid-19 cases on Sunday, down from 511 reported the day before. The US announced on Sunday that it will give it 750,000 vaccine doses. Phillips asks if we could be giving more vaccines to other countries ahead of the G7 summit next week. Hancock says: “My first duty is to protect the UK population, and that’s to reduce transmission. The way we’re helping the rest of the world is giving away at cost the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine and that means of the 2 billion doses delivered across the world, 500m doses are the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. 70% of those doses are in low and middle-income countries. “The reason we’ve been able to do this is is that we’ve made it available at cost, no charge of intellectual property from the start. I’m delighted there’s a debate, around the G7 table on how to vaccinate the world, but this country has done more than any other by ensuring the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is available at cost.” Responding on whether the government will respond to Blair’s call earlier (see 8.19), for global vaccine passports, as well as relaxations domestically for people who have had the jab. Hancock says: “This debate has been going on for months and we’ve been doing the work inside government, and we’ll be coming out with our answers on that soon. “We know it’s going to be needed internationally, on the domestic front, that’s a matter for Michael Gove.” Phillips asks if the government will want to vaccinate all children. The UK regulator, Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, approved the Pfizer jab for use on children aged between 12 and 15 earlier this week. A story in the Sunday Telegraph said that under plans drawn up by Whitehall, they would be offered the jab from mid-August. Hancock doesn’t rule it out, and says: “We’ve got a few weeks until we come out with a plan on how and if we take this forward. “We know the vaccine both protects you and helps stops it transmitting, and I want to protect education as much as anybody does. Making sure we don’t have those whole bubbles going home and the isolation, that has big upsides for education.” Under-30s are being invited to get their jabs this week, Hancock adds, as he says the link between infection and serious illness has been “severed but not broken” by the vaccine. Phillips asks whether there will be a modification of the roadmap, such as lifting lockdown but still asking people to work from home. “There are a series of things at the moment that we’ve said will be part of step four, which include the rule of six and the fact there’s still some businesses that are closed. “We have four reviews into international travel and certification and social distancing, and we are concluding those reviews and doing that at the same time.” Hancock urges people to go and get their second dose to try and stop the damage being caused by the India variant, that is 40% more transmissible. “It’s more difficult to manage this virus with the new variant. But after two doses of vaccine we are confident that you get the same protection as you did with the old variant. “The vaccine works just as effectively, and everyone must get their second jab though, as the first on its own isn’t quite as effective.” The health secretary Matt Hancock is on Sky News’ Trevor Phillips on Sunday, as part of a morning broadcast tour. He asks Hancock whether there will be a delay to the relaxing of restrictions on 21 June. “It’s too early to make a final decision on that,” Hancock begins. “The prime minister and the team will be looking over all the data over this week and we’ve said we will be giving people enough time ahead of 21 June when this is pencilled in, this next step.” He says it will depend on the four tests; cases, hospitalisations, the rollout of the vaccine and the impact of new variants. Hancock admits that there has been a significant impact of the Delta variant. Boris Johnson will urge G7 leaders to “defeat Covid” by vaccinating the world by the end of next year. The prime minister will stress the importance of the programme when he meets leaders on Friday in Cornwall for the first face-to-face G7 meeting since the beginning of the pandemic. The US, France, Germany, Italy and Japan have all said how many doses they will donate to the global vaccine programme, Covax. However the UK and Canada are yet to announce how many they will contribute. Johnson will also call for a global watch system to catch new variants before they spread more widely. Johnson said: “I’m calling on my fellow G7 leaders to join us to end this terrible pandemic and pledge will we never allow the devastation wreaked by coronavirus to happen again.” Head of the UK vaccines taskforce Kate Bingham is to be given a damehood, the Telegraph has reported, after getting the UK access to millions of doses of six different jabs. Her expected honour is among a number in next week’s Queen’s Birthday honours dedicated to “heroes” in the pandemic. Bingham was appointed to the role in May last year and left at the end of 2020. People who have had both doses of a Covid-19 vaccine should have restrictions relaxed for them, according to former prime minister Tony Blair. Blair’s thinktank, the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, sets out how the country should remain open if the virus persists in the population. The report, Less Risk, More Freedom, says that the NHS app – which is currently used for contact tracing – should be replaced with a system of global health passes. “The health pass needs to be usable both by national border authorities and other organisations within countries. It should also include the ability to demonstrate time-restricted testing status for those who aren’t able to be vaccinated. “With this ability to securely prove vaccination status, we can move beyond blunt, catch-all tools and align with other countries by removing certain restrictions for the fully vaccinated – thereby enabling us to sustainably reopen the economy,” the report says.

Pastry chef Anthony Hart took the baton of tempered chocolate torture from Kirsten Tibballs and commanded the returnees recreate his “chocolate oasis”, which I’m pretty sure I saw in a cubism group show at MoMA. Minoli triumphed and absolutely lost it, which was incredibly endearing. Finally, the final four of the returnees suffered through a three-course menu challenge final(e]. Maja’s deconstructed Splice, made using the skills she’d attained during her post-elimination work experience, secured her return to white-apron status alongside Minoli. And so Sunday rolls around, bringing with it another lighthearted fish butchery session. Yes, the human manifestation of one of those “Fish Fear Me” dad caps is back, welcoming the contestants by laying out his weaponry. It’s Josh Niland, everybody! Brent immediately forgets how much he enjoyed making fancy desserts and declares himself a fish butchery fanboy. Josh stands behind a hapless Murray cod: “I’m going to take this one fish and show you how to make it disappear … ” he teases, as I ready myself to be dazzled by sleight of hand, “... into three courses!” Hang on, this isn’t the junior championships of closeup magic?? “Oh my cod,” says Justin, possessed by the pun-mad spirit of The Goodies. Josh turns one cod into a “three-piece feed” entree, a roast with crackling, and finally a lamington with crystallised Murray cod scales. It’s a masterclass in inventive, low-waste butchery (ditching only the gills and gallbladder) that leaves the contestants with Car City eyes. “And again, this is something that you can all achieve,” he says, to gales of disbelieving laughter. It’s such a sustained display of witchcraft that by the time Josh turns fish scales into the lamington’s desiccated coconut I’m ready to sentence him to death by pressing. It’s to be a three-round, three-course challenge: the contestants have to butcher their own Murray cod and stretch it out across a potential three dishes. Fifteen minutes into round 1 and the contestants have said “hectic” roughly 40 times. Brent nearly puts his peanuts into Scott’s oven, as the bishop said to the improv troupe, but it’s all good, because Josh reckons Brent’s fish tacos “were worth getting your apron dirty” for. There’s praise, too, for Tommy, Justin, Depinder and Josh’s No 1 fan Sabina, whose barbecued pork belly he describes as “the perfect canapé”. Dan’s fish skin has gone rubbery. Amir’s sauce is off. There’s worse news for Minoli, whose cod is raw but whose sauce and sambal is so good that Mel and Josh cry out her name “MENDOZA!!” style. It’s on to round 2 for Linda, Pete, Kishwar, Amir, Maja, Dan and Minoli, with 45 minutes to try again with what’s left of their cod. Minoli is cooking the same dish again but “jazzing it up”; hey, if it ain’t cooked, don’t nix it, or whatever the old phrase is. Amir’s making fancy fish fingers, summoning the spirit of Captain Fishface. (BRB, changing my PhD research topic to cod in British TV comedy.) “It looks sick, smells good,” offers Justin from the gantry, readying himself to win the Pulitzer for food criticism. It’s time to taste. Pete’s up first, and as soon as Jock cuts into the poached cod, he stares deep into Pete’s soul: “Mate, I’m just gonna call it: this was not your round. Welcome to round 3.” As cod is my witness, he is broken in half!!! It’s better news for Linda, whose fried cod tail and loin with tamarind and chilli sauce sends the judges into apoplexies of pleasure. Josh declares that Maja’s dish, with minor adjustments, would be “on the menu tomorrow”. Kishwar’s is “wonderful”! Then we begin the slow slide into the abyss. Amir’s fish fingers are “enjoyable” but not amazing. Dan’s eggplant chips are soggy despite his “ripping” sauce. Minoli gives the judges deja vu with her second take on round 1’s raw fish fantasia, and … “That is easily the best plate of food today,” Josh declares. It’s so good it’s given him goosebumps. Minoli lives!! It’s left to Pete, Amir (“The salad was irrelevant”) and Dan to duke it out in round 3, with 60 minutes to bring it home. Dan’s doing laksa. Amir is going full Josh and using every bit of the cod he has left, impressing Jock and Andy. It’s a different story at Pete’s bench, where he’s “going to poach cod again”. “I need you guys to like it,” Pete says, describing a truly revolting-sounding blanched fish skin. Andy makes an expression that will soon replace the Oxford English Dictionary entry for “duh”. At time’s up, Dan is already crying. He’s given the competition his all but he’s not happy with his laksa. Dan, no!! Pete’s “elegant, very minimalist” dish is declared “a knockout”. Dan’s dish is “just a laksa”, and Amir’s Turkish dumpling “has potential”, but it’s Dan who the judges reckon left out the best remaining cuts of cod, so he’s going home. And may cod bless us, every one. What made me cry: Dan declaring that his MasterChef journey was the “second best” time of his life after his wedding day, and insisting that the true treasure was the friends he made along the way. The white chocolate velouté award for failure: Every attempt Pete made to cook bog-standard food. Remember yourself, Pete! You’re the ASMR-voiced master of weird stuff!

Several hundred people are thought to have been detained without trial in the east African country in secret prisons where they are subjected to a brutal regime of mistreatment. The country has suffered a series of crackdowns aimed at stamping out dissent since campaigning began for presidential elections late last year. The trigger for the most recent repression by security services appears to have been the swearing-in ceremony of Uganda’s veteran president, the 76-year-old Yoweri Museveni, in April. Museveni won a sixth term in office in January in an election denounced as fraudulent by the opposition. Police and other unidentified security agencies moved to arrest and detain hundreds in the week before and after the inauguration. Robert Kyagulanyi Ssentamu – the singer turned politician known by his stage name, Bobi Wine – who is Uganda’s main opposition leader, told the Guardian a member of the inner security team was tortured to death by security operatives in the capital, Kampala. The body of Daniel Apedel was found dumped at Mulago mortuary in Kampala bearing marks of torture on 22 May, Wine said. A police spokesperson said the 21-year-old had been beaten to death by a mob and that charges that he had been murdered after his arrest were baseless. Apedel had told fellow activists he was under constant surveillance by security authorities and had received threats after refusing an offer to “work with the government”. Witnesses heard Apedel pleading for mercy with someone he called “officer” shortly before he disappeared near his home in the Kireka district of Kampala on his way home from work. Three days later, a friend received an anonymous call saying Apedel’s body was at the morgue. “He had been beaten, hit, his fingers were broken, his teeth removed … it was grave torture. It was a very disturbing sight to see,” said Wine. Other detainees have had their joints or genitals beaten with wires, been burned with cigarettes or had fingernails torn out. Many have been members of Wine’s party, the National Unity Platform (NUP) party. “We are constantly finding people killed or dumped by the roadside, and there are many more who are just rotting in prisons all across the country,” Wine said. The NUP has listed more than 700 members and activists said to have been detained but said the true figure was likely to be higher. Luke Owoyesigire, the deputy spokesperson for the Kampala Metropolitan police, said officers had found Apedel’s body at the scene of a reported incident of “mob justice” but were unable to find witnesses because the incident happened at night and so “most people were already at their homes” obeying a curfew. He accused Wine of “playing sympathy politics”. “The gentleman was killed by the mob and the police are investigating who was behind it. There is nothing like torture. [Wine] should stop making conclusions before investigating further on the circumstances of the death,” Owoyesigire said. In the days before Museveni’s inauguration, police arrested more than 100 opposition activists on suspicion of planning to disrupt the ceremony. Some have been released, some produced in court and others remained in detention, officials said. Wine’s house has been surrounded by security forces for many months, and though he is allowed to leave, he is constantly followed. Among this detained after the inauguration was Kalanzi Sharif, an NUP party worker who was taken from his home at 3am on 18 May by uniformed and non-uniformed security operatives after family members were forced to reveal his hiding place. Sharif’s whereabouts are unknown, though he is believed to be in police custody. Four days later a group of about a dozen men and women were rounded up in Mbale, in eastern Uganda, apparently suspected of being opposition activists. Owoyesigire said police operations are ongoing with further arrests expected, adding that detainees were offered a chance to “work with” security services. “As soon as we have information about people who want to sabotage any activity, we … swing into action and make arrests. Those who aren’t directly involved in the activity, we let them go,” he said. Last week, Uganda’s general military court martial, sitting in Kampala, granted bail to 17 of Wine’s supporters who were arrested in the central district of Kalangala in January. Many others have been kept in jail as lengthy court proceedings continue. Large numbers appear not to have been charged at all. Many relatives complain they have no information about the fate of those taken. They say suspects have been denied access to medical treatment and lawyers, as well as contact with their family members. The unmarked vans used by security forces – known as “drones” – are sometimes visible on footage from traffic or other surveillance cameras close to the site of abductions. The Ugandan military has denied responsibility for any abuses and Museveni, in a national address in February, dismissed allegations that his forces had illegally detained civilians, saying the Ugandan army “is a disciplined force” and that his party “does not kill” its opponents. However, the president admitted that security services were holding more than 200 detainees who, he said, had revealed a “criminal scheme” run by the opposition and instigated by “local parasites” and “foreign backers”. “Too bad for the traitors,” Museveni said. “These poor [detained] youth gave us the whole scheme and they are now our friends.” The mounting evidence of systematic human rights abuses in Uganda has drawn sanctions from the US and other international powers. Museveni has been in power for 35 years and has long been perceived as a key ally of western powers in east Africa. The US and UK have given billions of dollars of development aid and security assistance to Uganda in recent years. Earlier this month, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, announced that visa restrictions would be imposed on those responsible for recent abuses. Uganda has received more than a $1bn of US aid each year, as well as £150m of assistance from the UK. Wine appealed to the international community to stop “sponsoring terror”. “The people of Uganda are helpless before the people of the world. The international community must not turn a blind eye to what is happening in Uganda. We just ask for Gen Museveni to be held accountable for human rights, the rule of law and all the values that bring us all together,” he said. Filings with the US Justice Department reveal that the Ugandan government has hired a UK-based public relations firm to improve its international image. The cost of such contracts often runs to several million dollars. Brig Flavia Byekwaso, the spokesperson for the Uganda People’s Defence Forces, said that as long as people remained being caught on the other side of the law they would be arrested. “We are not going to spare any arrests because [Wine] is going to talk [about it] … We can’t let misconduct happen. “We shall still continue to arrest those who are not doing what they are supposed to do,” she said.","charCount":"7226","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/jasonburke\">Jason Burke</a> in Johannesburg and <a href=\"profile/samuel-okiror\">Samuel Okiror</a> in Kampala"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2021/jun/06/martina-topley-bird-forever-i-wait-tricky-maxinquaye-aftermath","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-06T11:00:37Z","webTitle":"Martina Topley-Bird: ‘I wasn’t trying to be famous.

But it won’t always take her to where she wants to go. She’s agreed to an interview to promote <em>Forever I Wait</em>, her first album since 2010’s <em>Some Place Simple</em>, but she doesn’t enjoy talking about herself; she’s fully aware of her tendency to let conversations drift, leave sentences unfinished, not quite pin down the message she wants to deliver. Speaking to her can be like listening to some of her dreamier music: captivating, meditative, yet somehow with a sense of her barely being there at all. A typical anecdote might grind to a halt midway through: “But yeah… I don’t know… sorry, vagued out again!”</p> <p>There is also a subject that is never going to be easy to talk about. In 2019, Topley-Bird’s daughter, Mazy, also known as Mina, killed herself at the age of 24. She had suffered a psychotic episode following a gig with her band 404 and died after being admitted to West Park hospital, Darlington. An <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/apr/01/coroner-to-alert-hospital-chiefs-after-singers-suicide-talk-regarded-as-flippant\">inquest</a> led to the coroner saying he would make two prevention of future death reports to reduce the risk of patients self-harming on the ward. At the time, Topley-Bird put out a statement saying: “Sweet baby, life won’t be the same without you.” But she hasn’t spoken since. She’s said in advance today that the subject can be broached, but that doesn’t make it any less difficult. “I’m only just beginning to process it,” she later admits.</p> <p><em>Forever I Wait</em> does not address this tragedy directly – it was largely written in the years beforehand – although she accepts that people may interpret it that way and that it’s not entirely possible to untangle the two things. On the opening track, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/bnkfPAJ4uVE\">Pure Heart</a>, amid an electrical storm of dirty guitars, she sings of “A place I’ve never been to rest my tired heart/ And wait for it to heal so I can have a fresh start.” If nothing else, finishing the record gave her some structure, a focal point through the grief. “I created something to engage with and revolve around and interact my energy with,” she says. “Has that been healing? Yeah.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2dd5cdfb416861c95d5cca394900720d3df6cf51\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2dd5cdfb416861c95d5cca394900720d3df6cf51/0_86_1198_719/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Martina Topley-Bird’s daughter Mazy (also known as Mina), who died in 2019 aged 24.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Martina Topley-Bird’s daughter Mazy (also known as Mina), who died in 2019 aged 24.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What she’s hoping she can do today is explain just how much this record means to her – and why. Topley-Bird was still a child when she started working with Tricky in the early 90s, recording the white label <a href=\"https://youtu.be/25y3cMC9i94\">Aftermath</a> with him aged 15, before going on to add some of the strangest and most sublime vocals ever committed to tape on his debut album <em>Maxinquaye</em> a few years later. That record changed the shape of pop, helping invent with its ghostly, otherworldly qualities. Topley-Bird would appear on later Tricky records, but her solo career since has been fitful. One month after <em>Maxinquaye</em>’s release, she and Tricky had their daughter, Mazy, two huge life-changing events for a young woman who had originally been planning to go to university to study oceanography.</p> <p>“That rate of change was so intense,” she says. “Friends of my mother’s were having kids in their 40s and <em>they</em> were talking about how difficult it was to adjust. So yeah, it was stressful. I found it very difficult.”</p> <p>She finally released a solo album, <em>Quixotic</em>, in 2003, and has put out two more since. But those records, she says, didn’t provide creative fulfilment. “I felt like I had to keep making records because I was a parent. But I guess I was on the back foot a lot of the time. Essentially, I didn’t have all the skills I needed to achieve what I wanted to achieve, so I kind of look back on those records as exercises rather than pieces of art.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Essentially, I didn’t have all the skills I needed to achieve what I wanted to achieve</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><em>Forever I Wait</em>, then, feels like her debut album. It’s the first time she’s made something that she’s “98% happy with, which is better than the normal 60%”. It was pieced together over several years and in at least three countries: her partner, Nat, works in international development so they’ve had spells in Baltimore, London and Spain. She enlisted new management – female, Russian, no nonsense – who helped hone her vision and encouraged her to stamp her authority on the project. “Before, I would always be, like, ‘Let’s do this together and if it sounds good for me, I’ll keep it, and if for you, you keep it.’ I had to mature out of that and be like, ‘No, this is what <em>I’m</em> doing.’” Then she decided who could make this vision a reality and enlisted them as collaborators, Massive Attack’s Robert Del Naja and Fever Ray producer Christoffer Berg among them. The result is billed as a trip through Topley-Bird’s psyche.</p> <p>It is an album of contrasts: ice-cold synths and rough guitar textures rub shoulders, breaking into blissful, dreamlike passages. There are songs about crystal meth zombies who walked the meadows near her Baltimore home and the motorbiking African American kids she’d see pulling wheelies so vertical they called themselves 12 O’Clock Boys. There are also songs of self-doubt and self-acceptance.</p> <p><em>Forever I Wait</em> was almost complete when Mazy died. I ask if it was difficult to return to the project. “Actually, connecting with the record was helpful,” she says. “And just going through the process of getting to my desk and making lists and doing a lot of computer work helped. Because I’ve always found that if there’s difficult emotions going on, doing things that are rote or mechanical can be helpful.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRucznVhXnU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tRucznVhXnU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRucznVhXnU\">Listen to Pure Heart from Martina Topley-Bird’s forthcoming album, Forever I Wait</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>I sense a weariness in her voice so ask if she’s OK to talk about her daughter. She lets out a big exhale. “I don’t know. Generally I’m not. I get a feeling of a ball in my stomach and it’s still very unpredictable how I’ll feel.” With a suddenness that seems to take her by surprise she starts to cry. “I’d like to be able to comfort other people that are affected by it, too,” she says after a while. “But I don’t even know <em>how</em> to talk about it. It was just the two of us for a very long time, and…” She trails off again and I suggest we move on.</p> <p>“I’m sorry this has turned into a jolty ride,” she says with a laugh through the tears.</p> <p>I’m sorry for making you cry, I say.</p> <p>“It’s still unpredictable,” she says. “Nobody asks me on a day-to-day basis, so it’s not something I deal with. And so if I do go anywhere near it then, yeah, that starts happening and I’m not used to it.”</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Martina Topley-Bird was born in London in 1975, growing up in a large family with five siblings and three step-siblings. Her father, Martin Topley, died before she was born; her surname combines his with that of her stepfather. After moving to Bristol, she studied at the prestigious boarding school Clifton College. But a chance meeting with Tricky – he heard her singing outside his house – sent her life down a more musical path. Was she a rebellious teen?</p> <p>“I had quite a lot of attitude and was a tiny bit maybe arrogant, yeah,” she says. “I mean… yeah!”</p> <p>What did her family make of the sudden change in her life?</p> <p>“It wasn’t like a one-day thing. I did Aftermath but that didn’t get released for two years. It was kinda fun, people were calling to say that Björk liked the track and it sounded like Sade, but I was studying still. I’m not sure I told my parents about it.”</p> <p>It was later, while resitting some of her exams, that Topley-Bird embarked on a romantic relationship, worked on <em>Maxinquaye</em> and, as she puts it, her “life began to drift. I started to lose form, as it were.” She had sung in the school choir and in her piano teacher’s jazz band, but she had no recording experience when Tricky enlisted her as the record’s main vocalist. To make matters more confusing, it was one of the most unconventional records ever made: many of the vocals you hear are first takes, with Topley-Bird having never even heard the backing track before she recorded.</p> <p>“I wasn’t practising all day and then turning up to the studio to belt out show tunes,” she says with a smile. “A lot of those vocals sound like they do because that was the kind of vibe and way we were recording.”</p> <p>At the time, she was often described as Tricky’s “muse”, when in fact it was her conceiving the twisted melody lines of <a href=\"https://youtu.be/njDLlDEN3j4\">Ponderosa</a> or providing a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/9ZJTM03UByU\">completely fresh take</a> on Public Enemy’s <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ZM5_6js19eM\">Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos</a>. “It’s funny you should say that because I don’t actually have any written credit for those vocal melodies,” she notes, “but that is a <em>longer</em> story.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njDLlDEN3j4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/njDLlDEN3j4?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://youtu.be/njDLlDEN3j4\">Watch the video for Tricky’s Ponderosa.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Despite the uncompromising sound, <em>Maxinquaye</em> became a hit. Fame didn’t suit either Tricky or Topley-Bird. “I wasn’t trying to be famous,” she says. “I was embarrassingly earnest about being authentic and reverent of the music. I was young and being made very aware of what people’s perception of me and the situation was and I found that always uncomfortable. I don’t have any need to be recognised or stopped in the streets. I don’t crave that. So if I was recognised somewhere I would be a horrible arrogant teenager. People would say, ‘Are you Martina?’ and I would say, ‘Yeah, <em>and?</em>’ Not being very graceful about it.”</p> <p>Tricky has talked about how he viewed Martina as a mouthpiece for his mother, who killed herself when he was very young, as if his mother’s words were finding a voice through his vocalist. How did she feel about that?</p> <p>“We both had deceased parents, so there was maybe an affinity there. So if that’s what he believed… it’s something that’s very meaningful to him, I guess.”</p> <p>Despite her natural talent for melody lines, Topley-Bird had never written a proper song until she made <em>Quixotic</em>. That must have been daunting?</p> <p>“Yeah, it was, especially with lyric writing.” The song <a href=\"https://youtu.be/w2vNHsKhXIk\">Sandpaper Kisses</a>, which was sampled by the Weeknd in <a href=\"https://youtu.be/9FE-Pwm2cyc\">The Birds (Part 2)</a>, came to her first while on a train to her recording studio. “I relied on these random flashes of inspiration.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It was very difficult to figure out who to trust</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The music industry was equally tricky to navigate. She recalls her solo contract arriving in the post one day. “It was very difficult to figure out who to trust. Things were not so transparent back then. And I had no business experience at all and my family were not familiar with the ins and outs of the industry. I remember looking at my music friends who’d been to art school and thinking that kind of mentality and structure would have been good for somebody like me. Because I work more intuitively and instinctively and that doesn’t always get to the art I want to make.”</p> <p><em>Forever I Wait</em> was an attempt to rectify this approach. “I had to be honest and say what I wanted to do and not just flounder around and hope that I would eventually land on something.”</p> <p>A few days later, Topley-Bird requests another chat. She’s worried she slipped back into “the old habit of being vague and letting the conversation drift” and wants to clarify a few points. She’s been reflecting on how difficult it was to talk about Mazy and the fact that the inquest into her death only concluded recently has meant the wounds have been freshly reopened. “I’ve got a lot of support and love; I have my family, my partner, my partner’s family. I feel very cherished and supported by them. And I think it’s going to be a slow process. I’ve pulled myself and my project together and that is part of it.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"57ede8b3f8b9208e6b8765ffb3774e16623f0c75\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57ede8b3f8b9208e6b8765ffb3774e16623f0c75/0_197_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Performing with Tricky in London, 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Performing with Tricky in London, 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In many ways she’s happy now. She loves her life in Valencia with Nat and their dog, the city’s liberal approach to life and the fact that, before the pandemic, she’d see “people drinking red wine from 9.30am in the morning or staying out all night”. The city was very different during lockdown, but that also had its benefits. “Everything went really quiet so I didn’t have to worry about scurrying behind trying to keep up. Everyone was at this pace. There’s something about that that made me feel like I had something profound in common with everybody. Whereas a lot of the time I feel very different. I’m not an everyperson.”</p> <p>And she’s found a sense of fulfilment in working out how to express herself differently in her music. “Because I’m a lot more open. Maybe there’s some catharsis but I think it’s more an evolution, a growth. I’ve let go of some immature, restricting ideas. Bullshit beliefs that were not helping me achieve what I wanted to achieve or really be doing what I want to do.”</p> <p>In April last year, Topley-Bird travelled to the mountains by the sea south of Valencia to decide on the tracklisting. The album ends with Rain, which sees her singing over a string quartet: “One day while walking in the rain/ I found my path along the way.” It speaks of acceptance, of living in the present. It feels like a moment of cleansing and spiritual rejuvenation.</p> <p>The song’s lyric was written not by her but Nat. “It’s funny because she works in international development, she has never written lyrics before. But she thought she’d have a go. And I saw them and thought, ‘This is so not me. I would be cryptic and vague and I don’t know if I would be that person. But then I found a way to sing it.’”</p> <p>She’s beaming with pride now. And a sense that, despite everything, she’s finally arrived at what she wants to say.</p> <p><em>Forever I Wait is out 10 September on Awal</em></p> <ul> <li><p><em>In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.org\">jo@samaritans.org</a> or <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.ie\">jo@samaritans.ie</a>. </em><em>In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is <a href=\"tel:%28800%29%20273-8255\">1-800-273-8255</a>.

To make matters more confusing, it was one of the most unconventional records ever made: many of the vocals you hear are first takes, with Topley-Bird having never even heard the backing track before she recorded. “I wasn’t practising all day and then turning up to the studio to belt out show tunes,” she says with a smile. “A lot of those vocals sound like they do because that was the kind of vibe and way we were recording.” At the time, she was often described as Tricky’s “muse”, when in fact it was her conceiving the twisted melody lines of Ponderosa or providing a completely fresh take on Public Enemy’s Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos. “It’s funny you should say that because I don’t actually have any written credit for those vocal melodies,” she notes, “but that is a longer story.” Despite the uncompromising sound, Maxinquaye became a hit. Fame didn’t suit either Tricky or Topley-Bird. “I wasn’t trying to be famous,” she says. “I was embarrassingly earnest about being authentic and reverent of the music. I was young and being made very aware of what people’s perception of me and the situation was and I found that always uncomfortable. I don’t have any need to be recognised or stopped in the streets. I don’t crave that. So if I was recognised somewhere I would be a horrible arrogant teenager. People would say, ‘Are you Martina?’ and I would say, ‘Yeah, and?’ Not being very graceful about it.” Tricky has talked about how he viewed Martina as a mouthpiece for his mother, who killed herself when he was very young, as if his mother’s words were finding a voice through his vocalist. How did she feel about that? “We both had deceased parents, so there was maybe an affinity there. So if that’s what he believed… it’s something that’s very meaningful to him, I guess.” Despite her natural talent for melody lines, Topley-Bird had never written a proper song until she made Quixotic. That must have been daunting? “Yeah, it was, especially with lyric writing.” The song Sandpaper Kisses, which was sampled by the Weeknd in The Birds (Part 2), came to her first while on a train to her recording studio. “I relied on these random flashes of inspiration.” The music industry was equally tricky to navigate. She recalls her solo contract arriving in the post one day. “It was very difficult to figure out who to trust. Things were not so transparent back then. And I had no business experience at all and my family were not familiar with the ins and outs of the industry. I remember looking at my music friends who’d been to art school and thinking that kind of mentality and structure would have been good for somebody like me. Because I work more intuitively and instinctively and that doesn’t always get to the art I want to make.” Forever I Wait was an attempt to rectify this approach. “I had to be honest and say what I wanted to do and not just flounder around and hope that I would eventually land on something.” A few days later, Topley-Bird requests another chat. She’s worried she slipped back into “the old habit of being vague and letting the conversation drift” and wants to clarify a few points. She’s been reflecting on how difficult it was to talk about Mazy and the fact that the inquest into her death only concluded recently has meant the wounds have been freshly reopened. “I’ve got a lot of support and love; I have my family, my partner, my partner’s family. I feel very cherished and supported by them. And I think it’s going to be a slow process. I’ve pulled myself and my project together and that is part of it.” In many ways she’s happy now. She loves her life in Valencia with Nat and their dog, the city’s liberal approach to life and the fact that, before the pandemic, she’d see “people drinking red wine from 9.30am in the morning or staying out all night”. The city was very different during lockdown, but that also had its benefits. “Everything went really quiet so I didn’t have to worry about scurrying behind trying to keep up. Everyone was at this pace. There’s something about that that made me feel like I had something profound in common with everybody. Whereas a lot of the time I feel very different. I’m not an everyperson.” And she’s found a sense of fulfilment in working out how to express herself differently in her music. “Because I’m a lot more open. Maybe there’s some catharsis but I think it’s more an evolution, a growth. I’ve let go of some immature, restricting ideas. Bullshit beliefs that were not helping me achieve what I wanted to achieve or really be doing what I want to do.” In April last year, Topley-Bird travelled to the mountains by the sea south of Valencia to decide on the tracklisting. The album ends with Rain, which sees her singing over a string quartet: “One day while walking in the rain/ I found my path along the way.” It speaks of acceptance, of living in the present. It feels like a moment of cleansing and spiritual rejuvenation. The song’s lyric was written not by her but Nat. “It’s funny because she works in international development, she has never written lyrics before. But she thought she’d have a go. And I saw them and thought, ‘This is so not me. I would be cryptic and vague and I don’t know if I would be that person. But then I found a way to sing it.’” She’s beaming with pride now. And a sense that, despite everything, she’s finally arrived at what she wants to say.

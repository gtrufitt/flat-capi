Cummings told the hearing that he had brought in Case to be permanent secretary as he believed the prime minister was no longer listening to him on Covid-19. Five well-placed figures in the civil service said relations between Johnson and Case were precarious, in part due to his ties to the former Downing Street adviser.

But one senior Number 10 official said they “absolutely did not recognise that characterisation”, adding “the cabinet secretary and the prime minister have an excellent working relationship”. More from Kwasi Kwarteng’s morning broadcast round here, as he said care home residents were sufficiently protected. The UK business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, has defended Matt Hancock against criticism that he failed to protect people in care homes at the outset of the Covid pandemic, saying residents “were protected as far as we could”. The health secretary is under mounting pressure after Dominic Cummings accused him of promising ministers that all care residents in England were tested before being discharged back to their homes and then lying about this. On Thursday, Hancock denied the allegation but his explanation that it “wasn’t possible” to test all care home residents before they were discharged from hospital last March because the testing capacity was not yet available, has been called into question. Kwarteng said it was “very easy with hindsight” to say where things could have been improved. “I completely understand the anger and frustration about care homes, because a large number of people died, and it was a terrible situation,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “I think what Mr Hancock said was very clear. He’s always maintained that he wanted to build up the testing capacity. I think he was largely successful in that.” In Northern Ireland, new Ulster Unionist party (UUP) leader Doug Beattie has called for disillusioned Democratic Unionist party (DUP) members to join his party amid a potential schism after Edwin Poots was confirmed as its new leader. Beattie said they had an “awful lot to offer as politicians” and he would welcome them if they decided to defect. He added that no MLAs had approached him, according to PA Media, but conversations had been had with a few individuals. It comes as Poots was confirmed as the DUP’s new leader on Thursday, after Arlene Foster was ousted earlier this year. One member told the BBC that the meeting where Poots was ratified was the worst he had attended in 40 years as a member. Several leading DUP politicians left after the vote, before Poots made his speech. Beattie said: “Our door is always open to people who want to come to the Ulster Unionist Party, but if they want to do so they come understanding the Ulster Unionist Party values and I will talk to them and anyone who wants to come to make sure they understand that before I offer them the ability to join. “If we bring anyone in, and we are a welcoming party, it must be going in our direction, seeing Northern Ireland through our eyes.” Surgical hubs should be created across England and the government should spend £1bn annually for the next five years to reduce the “colossal” backlog in non-urgent procedures, the Royal College of Surgeons has said. The recommendations are two of a dozen suggestions made by the RCS designed to ensure planned surgery can continue safely if the country is hit again by another wave of coronavirus, a new variant or a severe winter/flu outbreak. All elective or planned surgery, such as for knee and hip replacements, was cancelled in the first wave of the pandemic. The latest figures show that in March, 4.95 million people were waiting for hospital treatment in England – the largest figure on record – including 436,127 people waiting more than a year a year. Away from Covid, ex-MP George Galloway announced yesterday that he is set to run in the Batley and Spen byelection on 1 July. Galloway, whose party All For Unity got 0.9% of the vote in the recent Scottish parliament elections, said he was standing in protest against Labour leader Keir Starmer. Labour has selected Kim Leadbeater, the sister of Jo Cox who was MP for the seat when she was murdered in 2016, as it hopes to avoid a repeat of their defeat in Hartlepool in May. Leeds councillor Ryan Stephenson has been chosen as the Conservative party candidate. Pressure is growing on the government to begin the public inquiry into its handling of the Covid pandemic, days after the prime minister’s former top adviser Dominic Cummings said any delay was “completely terrible”. Our social affairs correspondent, Robert Booth has more: Boris Johnson is facing a growing clamour to bring forward the start of the coronavirus public inquiry after Dominic Cummings’ allegations triggered a “political pantomime” that disrespects the victims of the pandemic, their relatives said. The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group, which represents thousands of grieving people, called for an urgent start to the inquiry, which is due to begin in spring 2022. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) joined the call, alongside Lord Kerslake, the former head of the civil service under David Cameron, Angela Rayner, the deputy Labour leader, and Ed Davey, the leader of the Liberal Democrats. Welcome to today’s UK coronavirus liveblog, as Boris Johnson faces calls to push back the relaxing of rules on 21 June in England over fears about a third wave from the India variant. Both Independent Sage member Christina Pagel and business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng were cautious when they spoke to breakfast programmes this morning.

It’s one that was touch-and-go to even go ahead and one that will proceed in the absence of spectators. Thankfully it is indeed happening. Not often do we see a 1-v-2 in round 11 of the season but that’s what we have on our hands tonight.</p> <p>Its lustre might have been brighter had Melbourne beaten Adelaide last week and come into this contest unbeaten, but let’s be grateful for what we’ve got. This is still a Friday night worth staying in for, and let’s face it if you’re in Victoria you’ve got no choice anyway. So fill the fridge full of VB/Kombucha/Yakult and strap yourselves in for a match that will reveal more and more about the supposed leading lights for this year’s premiership.</p> <p>This is a real chance for both teams. It’s a chance for the Bulldogs to prove without a shadow of doubt that they are the real deal, the finest outfit in the AFL. Beat the Demons and that cannot be in dispute. Should Melbourne bounce back, however, we’ll likely be back in the murky waters of ambiguity. All of which, it must be said, is tempered by the fact it is only round 11 and Covid-19 could still resurface to bite all and sundry on the derriere.</p> <p>But that can wait. All that matters is a top-of-the-table clash and a Friday night to savour. I’m here to keep you posted. You’re here, among other duties, to keep me company. If you’d like to get involved, you know the drill. Let’s do this thing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AFL/status/1398182728772636680\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Wish you were here ❤️<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/AFLDogsDees?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#AFLDogsDees</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/pZq2mJCcwu\">pic.twitter.com/pZq2mJCcwu</a></p>&mdash; AFL (@AFL) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AFL/status/1398182728772636680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 28, 2021</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-05-28T09:05:13.178Z\">at 10.05am BST</time></p>  </div>","wordcount":"1104","commentCloseDate":"2021-05-31T09:00:00Z","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2021-05-28T09:05:17Z","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2021-05-28T10:26:28Z","liveBloggingNow":"true","productionOffice":"AUS","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/p/ht49x","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c321caecaddcaa86d333d664632e7c49f5c8422/0_79_2362_1418/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","isLive":"true","bodyText":"No fans but plenty of action as Melbourne start the game much stronger after their disappointment against the Crows last week.

Q1: 3 mins remaining: Western Bulldogs 2-2 (14) vs Melbourne 5-5 (35) Another error in defence gives Melbourne a shot on goal but Spargo can’t convert from a tightish angle, missing to the left. Q1: 4 mins remaining: Western Bulldogs 2-2 (14) vs Melbourne 5-4 (34) Goal! Spargo has a set shot from the boundary but instead of having a crack he centres the ball and the Dogs fail to deal with the chaos ball as Jordon pounces and puts the Dees further in front. Q1: 6 mins remaining: Western Bulldogs 2-2 (14) vs Melbourne 4-4 (28) Goal! Big blue from the Dogs defence as Fritsch takes an intercept grab before spinning off the mark and snapping for another for the Dees. Q1: 8 mins remaining: Western Bulldogs 2-2 (14) vs Melbourne 3-3 (21) Goal! That man Naughton gets his hands on the ball just inside 50 and makes no mistake with his set shot. Timely goal for the Dogs. Q1: 10 mins remaining: Western Bulldogs 1-2 (8) vs Melbourne 3-3 (21) The Dees work the ball out of defence with some sharp passing. As the ball flies high over centre wing you really get the sense of no one being there. The stands are empty. Not even canned applause from the broadcasters. It’s like 2020 all over again. Please, God, let it be brief. Q1: 12 mins remaining: Western Bulldogs 1-1 (7) vs Melbourne 3-2 (20) Goal! Another quick break from Melbourne and the Dogs are caught unawares as Fritsch plays on and snaps truly to make it three for the Dees. Big start to the game from Melbourne. Q1: 14 mins remaining: Western Bulldogs 1-1 (7) vs Melbourne 2-1 (13) Goal! Big clearance win for the Bulldogs and Weightman judges a chaos ball best to find space and kick truly to drag one back. Lovely finish. Q1: 15 mins remaining: Western Bulldogs 0-1 (1) vs Melbourne 2-1 (13) Goal! From the kick-in the Dees regain possession and Petracca does the rest with an assured snap to put the Dees further in front. Q1: 16 mins remaining: Western Bulldogs 0-1 (1) vs Melbourne 1-1 (7) McDonald has space, then Fritsch has space, but the latter squanders his chance from the left as he drags his set shot to the left. Q1: 17 mins remaining: Western Bulldogs 0-1 (1) vs Melbourne 1-0 (6) Now Melbourne are on the attack. Clean hands from Bailey Smith on 50 gives the Dogs a shot on goal but the Dees talls are there to save the day. Q1: 19 mins remaining: Western Bulldogs 0-0 (0) vs Melbourne 1-0 (6) Goal! And we’re away. Gawn fairly well strips the ball from the centre bounce and before you know it Harmes pounces on a loose ball inside 50 and kicks a very, very quick goal. Wow, that was quick. Not long now... If you’ve been a bit busy and/or avoiding the crapness of Covid-19, this is the present state of crapness. In case anyone is unsure, Sir Doug Nicholls Round is about much more than a guernsey design tweak. Am I the only dude who thinks Bailey Smith is a dead ringer for Billy from Stranger Things? If anyone’s keen for a spot of background viewing, here’s some highlights of the last time these two met. And even more recently, if you know what I mean. Don’t sit on the fence, HoO. Worst case you’re a 50-50 shot. I’m with the Dogs. Lest anyone be under a rock, Victoria is back in a very dark place. Please, please let it be brief. Western Bulldogs B: Taylor Duryea, Alex Keath, Hayden Crozier HB: Bailey Williams, Zaine Cordy, Caleb Daniel C: Bailey Dale, Tom Liberatore, Jason Johannisen HF: Lachie Hunter, Josh Bruce, Cody Weightman F: Tim English, Aaron Naughton, Marcus Bontempelli FOLL: Jordon Sweet, Jack Macrae, Bailey Smith I/C: Patrick Lipinski, Lachlan McNeil, Roarke Smith, Riley Garcia Sub: Louis Butler Melbourne B: Jayden Hunt, Steven May, Jake Lever HB: Christian Salem, Harrison Petty, Michael Hibberd C: Angus Brayshaw, Christian Petracca, Ed Langdon HF: James Jordon, Tom McDonald, Jake Melksham F: Bayley Fritsch, Sam Weideman, Charlie Spargo FOLL: Max Gawn, Clayton Oliver, Kysaiah Pickett I/C: James Harmes, Luke Jackson, Trent Rivers, Alex Neal-Bullen Sub: Tom Sparrow A battle of the midfield, to be sure. And it sure helps to get a run for the Dogs if your first name is Bailey. Here’s one of them. The one with the big hair. Good evening and welcome to the opening fixture of the Sir Doug Nicholls Round. It’s one that was touch-and-go to even go ahead and one that will proceed in the absence of spectators. Thankfully it is indeed happening. Not often do we see a 1-v-2 in round 11 of the season but that’s what we have on our hands tonight. Its lustre might have been brighter had Melbourne beaten Adelaide last week and come into this contest unbeaten, but let’s be grateful for what we’ve got. This is still a Friday night worth staying in for, and let’s face it if you’re in Victoria you’ve got no choice anyway. So fill the fridge full of VB/Kombucha/Yakult and strap yourselves in for a match that will reveal more and more about the supposed leading lights for this year’s premiership. This is a real chance for both teams. It’s a chance for the Bulldogs to prove without a shadow of doubt that they are the real deal, the finest outfit in the AFL. Beat the Demons and that cannot be in dispute. Should Melbourne bounce back, however, we’ll likely be back in the murky waters of ambiguity. All of which, it must be said, is tempered by the fact it is only round 11 and Covid-19 could still resurface to bite all and sundry on the derriere. But that can wait. All that matters is a top-of-the-table clash and a Friday night to savour. I’m here to keep you posted. You’re here, among other duties, to keep me company. If you’d like to get involved, you know the drill. Let’s do this thing.","charCount":"6132","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/scott-heinrich\">Scott Heinrich</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/live/2021/may/28/markets-rally-biden-6tn-budget-proposal-eurozone-confidence-core-inflation-markets-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-28T10:25:41Z","webTitle":"European stock markets hit record high as economic confidence rises – business live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2021/may/28/markets-rally-biden-6tn-budget-proposal-eurozone-confidence-core-inflation-markets-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2021/may/28/markets-rally-biden-6tn-budget-proposal-eurozone-confidence-core-inflation-markets-business-live","fields":{"headline":"European stock markets hit record high as economic confidence rises – business live","standfirst":"<p>Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial news</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2021/may/28/markets-rally-biden-6tn-budget-proposal-eurozone-confidence-core-inflation-markets-business-live?page=with:block-60b0b1518f086d71cc15d3b8#block-60b0b1518f086d71cc15d3b8\">Latest: Eurozone economic confidence rose in May</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2021/may/28/markets-rally-biden-6tn-budget-proposal-eurozone-confidence-core-inflation-markets-business-live?page=with:block-60b0a5698f086d71cc15d31b#block-60b0a5698f086d71cc15d31b\">European stock markets hit new high this morning</a></li></ul><p>Earlier:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2021/may/28/markets-rally-biden-6tn-budget-proposal-eurozone-confidence-core-inflation-markets-business-live?page=with:block-60b083cd8f086d71cc15d1b3#block-60b083cd8f086d71cc15d1b3\">Biden expected to propose $6tn US budget for 2022</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2021/may/27/joe-biden-republicans-covid-coronavirus-us-politics-latest-updates?page=with:block-60afe48a8f08d486a77150f6#block-60afe48a8f08d486a77150f6\">Yesterday: Biden celebrates businesses reopening and vaccinations rising</a></li><li>Coming up: US core inflation data</li></ul>","trailText":"Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial news","byline":"Graeme Wearden","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d009d74840c964a40dced9930055084d3cfa4e82\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d009d74840c964a40dced9930055084d3cfa4e82/0_95_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The bull sculpture outside the Deutsche Boerse stock exchange in Frankfurt am Main, western Germany\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The bull sculpture outside the Deutsche Boerse stock exchange in Frankfurt am Main, western Germany</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Roland/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<div id=\"block-60b0c4cb8f088d8c3178bc10\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/jasper-jolly\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-05-28T10:25:41.878Z\">11.25am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Twitter has listed a new paid-for “Twitter Blue” service on app stores, suggesting the social media company may launch its long-rumoured subscription service soon.</strong></p> <p>Mobile phone app stores showed the service, although <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/may/17/twitter-mulling-paid-service-called-twitter-blue-finds-researcher\">its expected features</a> did not yet appear to be available.</p> <p>A subscription plan has long been expected as Twitter looks for more ways to make money from its large user base.

Mobile phone app stores showed the service, although its expected features did not yet appear to be available. A subscription plan has long been expected as Twitter looks for more ways to make money from its large user base. In April, the company said it had 199 million users from whom it could make money every day, a 20% year-on-year increase. On Apple’s App Store Twitter lists “Twitter Blue” under in-app purchases for £2.49 in the UK and $2.99 in the US store. On the Android store the Twitter listing shows “in-app purchases” but does not list pricing for the service. The economic confidence report also shows that inflation expectations are building as the European economy pick up. Consumer price expectations increased further in May, for the fifth month in a row, and above the long-term average - showing people are bracing for higher inflation over the coming year. Those concerns seem justified. European businesses said they expect to be lifting their prices over the next 12 months. Selling price expectations among manufacturers, who have been hit by the surge in commodity prices and transports, hit a record. The survey says: Selling price expectations saw the third month of marked and uniform increases across all surveyed business sectors, i.e. industry, services, retail trade and construction, reaching an all-time high in industry. Here’s some reaction to the rise in eurozone economic confidence, from ING’s Bert Colijn... ...and Howard Archer of EY Item Club. Economic confidence across the eurozone has hit a three-year high, as optimism over the recovery from the pandemic rises. It was lifted by a jump in sentiment at service sector firms, retailers and among consumers, as Covid-19 restrictions are eased, new data from from the European Commission shows. The EC’s index of eurozone economic sentiment has jumped to 114.5 points in May from 110.5 in April, higher than expected, and close to its December 2017 peak. It also rose strongly in the wider EU, up 4 points to 113.9. These readings are “markedly above its long-term average and pre-pandemic level”, says the EC, with employment expectations also rising. Optimism in the services sector rose the most, and broke above its long-term average for the first time since March last year - jumping from 2.2 to 11.3 in the euro area. The report explains: Managers expressed more positive views on the past business situation and past demand, and were more optimistic on demand expectations. Consumer confidence increased for the fourth time in a row (+3.0), driven by an improvement in all its components (i.e. views on their household’s past and future financial situation, their expectations of the general economic situation in their country, and their intentions to make major purchases). Industry confidence increased for the sixth month in a row, with managers reporting strong order books and improved export demand. Retail trade confidence rose for the third time in a row (+2.8), and construction confidence improved (+1.9), as managers reported improved order books and more optimistic employment expectations. Back on Joe Biden’s budget proposal...CNBC say the president is proposing $5tn in new federal spending over the next 10 years. President Joe Biden will propose $5 trillion in new federal spending over the next decade on Friday, part of his fiscal year 2022 budget request, a source familiar with the proposal tells CNBC. The new spending would be paid for in part by $3.6 trillion in additional revenues over the same period. The result would be a net deficit of $1.4 trillion, which would begin shrinking after 2030. Biden will include $300 billion of the $5 trillion total in his budget request to Congress for fiscal year 2022. This will bring the president’s total budget request for next year to $6 trillion, the source said. European stocks have hit a new all-time high, as optimism over the economic recovery continues to lift share prices across the region. The Europe-wide Stoxx 600 index has gained 0.45% this morning to 448.45 points, a fresh record. Every sector is higher, led by financials, industrial stocks and utilities. The Stoxx 600 has now gained over 12% so far this year, amid optimism that Europe’s economy will rebound strongly from the pandemic - now that Covid-19 vaccination programs have picked up speed. Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC are both up around 0.4%. Recent European economic data has shown activity is picking up strongly, with business growth hitting a three-year high this month and the EC upgrading its own growth forecasts. America’s strong recovery, and president Biden’s spending plans, are also providing a lift. Frédérique Carrier, Head of Investment Strategy, RBC Wealth Management, says the European economy is reviving faster than most observers expected. Europe, where many countries had to extend lockdown measures, is finally emerging from a long economic winter thanks to lower infection rates and an accelerating vaccine rollout. Carrier has upgraded her view on European equities to ‘overweight’, predicting they will see a ‘conducive climate’ over the next six to 12 months. She writes: As macroeconomic momentum builds, earnings delivery is strong and both management and consensus forecasts are being revised upwards. The Q1 reporting season was exceptionally robust, with companies in the Euro STOXX Index, an index of some 300 European companies, easily beating consensus expectations and generating earnings per share growth of close to 40 percent year over year, driven by sales increases and margin expansion. Moreover, management teams overall were optimistic on a demand recovery, though some noted concerns regarding supply shortages. Most were confident of their pricing power and ability to reduce costs. Following a heady Q1, upgraded forecasts suggest the earnings recovery is likely to last into next year. The consensus is looking for earnings growth of around 15 percent year over year for 2022. In the City, the blue-chip FTSE 100 index has risen 30 points to 7050 points, up 0.45%. Top risers include energy firm SSE (+2.6%), and UK housebuilders Taylor Wimpey (+2.5%), Barratt Development (+2.4%) and Persimmon (+2.1%). Luxury fashion group Burberry (+2.5%), and financial stocks such as HSBC (+2.4%) and Prudential (+2.4%) are also higher this morning. Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor, says the prospect of higher inflation is pushing the market up. “Further signs that the US economy is beginning to run hot prompted another switch into value stocks, at the expense of growth. The renewed consideration of cyclical stocks as an investment destination has generally played into the hands of the FTSE100, which has now risen by 9% in the year to date. The index is replete with sectors falling into the recovery category, such as the banks, oils and miners. For the likes of the airlines and the hospitality sectors, however, the outlook remains rather more cloudy as both travel restrictions and the emergence of Covid-19 variants hinder a smooth return to some sort of normality. The US stock market is expected to open higher later today. The Dow Jones industrial average up around 0.5% in pre-market trading, adding to yesterday’s 0.4% gain. Australia’s benchmark stock index, the S&amp;P/ASX 200, has hit a record closing high today, amid renewed optimism in the global economic outlook and the prospect of a $6tn Biden budget. The mining sector was leading the gains with financials, energy, industrials and consumer staples also higher. Higher US spending could mean greater demand for commodities and a wider boost to growth. This lifted the index to its highest close, and near the intraday high hit early in the pandemic. The Australian Financial Review reports: A sharp rally in domestic miners and energy stocks drove the S&amp;P/ASX 200 Index to a fresh closing high of 7179.5, rising 84.6 points, or 1.2 per cent, on Friday amid speculation that US President Joe Biden is planning an infrastructure friendly $6 trillion budget. Shares exceeded their May 10 record of 7172.8 points, but not the intraday high of 7197 set on February 20, 2020. Asian stocks have put global equities on course for a seventh day of gains today as investors bet the U.S. will lead the world out of the COVID-19 pandemic, points out Reuters. While Japan’s Nikkei led the way with a 2.1% jump, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 0.3% earlier today. The MSCI world equity index added 0.1% to 709.71, nearing the all-time closing high of 710.36 set on May 7. However, China’s CSI 300 index dipped by 0.3%. Kyle Rodda of IG explains why president Biden’s budget plans have lifted spirits: Given its sensitivity to swings in the business cycle, commodity prices and global trade, Asia’s financial markets could arguably be said to benefit most from a big spending US fiscal package. As much seemed to manifest in the region’s stock markets today: Asia’s benchmark indices have generally put in solid rallies to end the month – with the notable exception of Chinese stocks, which have traded flat – as markets discount the possibility of another pump-priming of global growth by the US. The export sensitive Nikkei has been the noteworthy outperformer, despite Japan extending its state of emergency today. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Global stock markets are nudging higher as investors brace for president Joe Biden to propose a $6tn spending package when he unveils his first budget later today. Biden is expected to propose record federal spending of $6tn in the 2022 financial year, starting in October, rising to $8.2 trillion by 2031, according to a report in the New York Times. Citing documents it had obtained, the NYT said the Democratic president planned to pay for his agenda through increased taxes on corporations and high earners, with budget deficits expected to decrease in the 2030s. The budget will show how Biden intends to deliver on his sweeping domestic agenda. That includes the American Jobs Plan to build new transport, water, energy and broadband infrastructure, modernise homes, and boost manufacturing, and the American Families Plan to invest more in childcare and education. The budget will also outline how the White House see inflation, employment, and economic growth panning out. The budget deficit is expected to hit $1.8tn in 2022. But the documents will also be aspirational. Biden’s Democrats hold only narrow majorities in the House and Senate, and the Republicans are pushing for a smaller infrastructure package instead. So a pitched battle lies ahead. As Reuters explains: Republicans have criticized the president for seeking trillions in new spending, setting the stage for pitched battles over his priorities. “It just seems like the trillions keep on coming,” Republican U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito, who is leading a group of colleagues pursuing a counteroffer to Biden’s current $1.7 trillion infrastructure proposal. Yesterday, president Biden told an event in Cleveland that it’s the right time to invest in the economic recovery: “Now is the time to build (upon) the foundation that we’ve laid to make bold investments in our families and our communities and our nation. We know from history that these kinds of investments raise both the floor and the ceiling over the economy for everybody.” Hailing the recent progress against Covid-19, Biden added: “We’ve turned the tide on the once-in-a-century pandemic. “And now we’re faced with a question: what kind of economy are we going to build for tomorrow? What are we going to do? I believe this is our moment to rebuild an economy from the bottom up and the middle out.” Asia-Pacific equity markets have been boosted overnight, with Japan’s Nikkei jumping 2.1% and South Korea’s Kospi gaining 0.8%. Investors anticipate that this surge in US spending will feed through to the global economy, as Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at OANDA, explains: President Biden’s Preliminary Budget is envisaging a $1.8 trillion deficit next year, after tax rises. Of course, what the President would like, and what he will get from Congress could be quite different, but with that level of spending, Asia appears to feel that some of that goody bag will fall their way, and Asian equity markets have risen today Strong economic data yesterday is also supporting stocks, with the number of new US jobless claims falling to a pandemic low yesterday, and US growth confirmed at a pacy 1.6% in the last quarter (while the UK and eurozone contracted). Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote, says: A robust GDP growth in the first quarter, a fresh pandemic low print in weekly jobless claims and the talk of a $6 trillion federal spending package for the coming fiscal year boosted appetite in most equities and the US dollar. But could inflation fears spoil the party again? Later today we get the latest ‘core PCE price’ index -- the US Federal Reserve’s preferred gauge of inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices.

Finishing fourth after nine successive titles just didn’t cut it. Here’s the goodbye on the official Juventus website. Are you sitting comfortably children?... Thanks Andrea. These are the first words that all of us must pronounce at the end of this special experience lived together. A few months ago Andrea Pirlo, an icon of world football, began a new adventure on the Juventus bench, his first as a coach. To do this, first of all it takes courage, as well as awareness of one’s own means, especially in a period marked by many difficulties, with the world forced by the pandemic to reinvent its own rules day after day. Andrea did it too: he started (and we are sure of this: his will be a brilliant career as a coach) a journey of transformation, seeking, and often managing, to bring his ideas and his experience as a champion on the pitch from the “Other side” of the barricade. For the courage, the dedication, the passion with which he demonstrated every day, our thanks go to the ‘Maestro’, the coach and to Andrea, that really comes from the heart, as well as our good luck for the future that will surely be a wonderful one. Well, no-one thought this was going to just Fade Away... We’ve heard from Noel but nothing yet from Liam about the Champions League final. At least he didn’t miss this open goal after Wednesday night’s events in Gdansk. David Tindall here now. While John goes off to eat cake after putting the thought in his mind, I’ll take the blog for a while. They will probably hold off the chocolate cake for tonight. Plenty of time for that on Sunday. Saturday night in the Estádio do Dragão will all be about mentality, and Ben Welch’s piece for the Blizzard, carried in these pages, hears from psychologists and players who share their tips for staying self-assured. The rest of the Premier League will look on at City and Chelsea with gimlet eyes, but the transfer window is about to be prised open. Manchester United look like early market movers, though we probably say that every year. Noel Gallagher has been talking to the BBC about Manchester City and, well, himself. What Manchester City have done is exactly what the owners said would happen. When they came in and said they were determined to turn us into one of the biggest clubs in Europe and the world, all I was thinking was, I don’t care what you do, as long as that banner comes down at Old Trafford, the one showing how long we’d been without a trophy. I remember meeting [City chairman] Khaldoon Al Mubarak at the start and telling him that and he was adamant, saying ‘oh no no no, it’s going to be much greater than that’. I was like ‘whatever’ but my God they have been true to their word and it has just been an amazing journey that the club has been on. It feels like quite a neat anniversary - we’ve had 10 years of the High Flying Birds and 10 years of City in the Champions League. Not only that but it’s my birthday on Saturday and I’m going to be in Porto, so it’s a big day all round. And here’s the brilliant Barney Ronay on Kevin De Bruyne, the main man for Manchester City. De Bruyne will turn 30 next month. He’s about to play his 494th professional game. To date he has three Premier League titles, an FA Cup and five League Cups, which is certainly a lot of League Cups. He has been player of the year in England, Germany and Belgium, but never above ninth spot in the Ballon d’Or. This will be Manchester City’s second European final. Remembering Big Mal, Joe Mercer, the other Neil Young with those who were in Vienna in 1970, including City stalwart Tommy Booth. Jacob Steinberg dove deeply into Tactics Tom ahead of the final. Great piece. Saturday is also upon us, and it will be a tremendous day of red hot soccer. Brentford and Swansea, two teams who play the game the ‘right’ way will serve as an hors d’oeuvre for the evening’s events in Porto when they play in the EFL Championship play-off final.

I think of this bias, which insists the center is not biased, not afflicted with agendas, prejudices, and destructive misperceptions, as status-quo bias. Underlying it is the belief that things are pretty OK now, that the people in charge should be trusted because power confers legitimacy, that those who want sweeping change are too loud or demanding or unreasonable, and that we should just all get along without looking at the skeletons in the closet and the stuff swept under the rug. It’s mostly a prejudice of people for whom the system is working, against those for whom it’s not.</p> <p>I saw a tweet the other day that said the Secret Service and US Capitol police must have been incompetent or complicit to be blindsided by the 6 January insurrection. The writer didn’t seem to grasp the third option: that the Secret Service was unable to see past the assumptions that middle-aged conservative white men don’t pose a threat to democracy and the rule of law, that elected officials in powerful places weren’t whipping up a riot or worse, that danger meant outsiders and others. A decade ago, when I went to northern Japan for the first anniversary of the Great Tohuko Earthquake and tsunami, I was told that the hundred-foot-high wave of black water was so inconceivable a sight that some people could not recognize it and the danger it posed. Others assumed this tsunami would be no bigger than those in recent memory and did not flee high enough. A lot of people died of not being able to see the unanticipated.</p> <p>People fail to recognize things that do not fit into their worldview, which is why those in power have not adequately responded to decades of terrorism by white men – anti-reproductive-rights-driven killings, racial violence in churches, mosques, synagogues and elsewhere, homophobia and transphobia, the pandemic-scale misogynist violence behind a lot of mass shootings, attacks on environmentalists, and white supremacy in the ranks of the police and the military. Finally, this year US attorney general, Merrick Garland, called this terrorism by its true name and <a href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/white-supremacy-is-top-security-threat-ag-garland-says-165923811.html\">identified</a> it as “the most dangerous threat to our democracy.” The constant assumption has been that crime and trouble comes from outsiders, from “them,” not “us,” which is why last summer’s Black Lives Matter protests were constantly portrayed by conservatives and sometimes the mainstream as far more violent and destructive than they were and the right has had such an easy time demonizing immigrants.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>People fail to recognize things that do not fit into their worldview, which is why those in power have not adequately responded to decades of terrorism by white men</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What violence and destruction did take place in or adjacent to Black Lives Matter protests was often the work of the rightwing. That includes the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/california-shootings-us-news-courts-ca-state-wire-bcfb15b9a261ee251be940d9b081902f\">murder</a> of a guard at a federal court in Oakland, allegedly by an air force sergeant and Boogaloo Boy, while a BLM protest was going on nearby. It also reportedly includes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/23/texas-boogaloo-boi-minneapolis-police-building-george-floyd\">some of the arson</a> in Minneapolis shortly after George Floyd’s murder, as well as attacks on protesters. USA Today <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/07/08/vehicle-ramming-attacks-66-us-since-may-27/5397700002/\">reported</a> 104 such attacks by cars driven into crowds, many of them apparently politically motivated.</p> <p>No one has ever loved the status quo more than the editorial board at the New York Times, which recently composed an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/18/opinion/nyc-pride-police-parade.html\">editorial</a> declaring it a misstep for “the city’s Pride organizers … to reduce the presence of law enforcement at the celebration, including a ban on uniformed police and corrections officers marching as groups until at least 2025.” They found a lesbian of color who is also a cop and focused on this individual feeling “devastated,” rather than the logic behind the decision. Pride celebrates the uprising against longtime police violence and criminalization of queerness at the Stonewall Bar in 1969.</p> <p>Police officers are in no way banned from participating out of uniform, if they so desire, but that’s not enough for these “can’t we all get along” editorialists, who also wrote: “But barring LGBTQ officers from marching is a politicized response and is hardly worthy of the important pursuit of justice for those persecuted by the police.” You want to shout that the whole parade is political, because persecution and inequality have made being LGBTQ political, and the decision to include the police would be no less political than to exclude them. And who decides what’s worthy? The idea that there is some magically apolitical state all should aspire to is key to this bias and to why it refuses to recognize itself as a bias. It believes it speaks from neutral ground, which is why it forever describes a landscape of mountains and chasms as a level playing field.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"00499854dd1c45bf0ff9da692d6b7d026c9fb0c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/00499854dd1c45bf0ff9da692d6b7d026c9fb0c7/0_43_4887_2932/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘Another fallacy of the centrist stance is that right and left are symmetrically exteme’\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Another fallacy of the centrist stance is that right and left are symmetrically exteme’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julio Cortez/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The status-quo bias is something I’ve encountered over and over again as gender violence, particularly as the refusal or inability to recognize that a high-status man or boy, be he film mogul or high-school football player, can also be a vicious criminal. Those who cannot believe the charges, no matter how credible, often dismiss and blame the victim instead (or worse: reporting a rape too often leads to death threats and other forms of harassment and intimidation intended to make an uncomfortable truth go away). Society has a marked failure of imagination when it comes to grasping that such predators treat their low-status victims in secret differently than their high-status peers in public, and that failure of imagination denies the existence of such inequality even as it perpetrates it.</p> <p>It’s a failure born out of undue respect for the powerful. (Here I think of all the idiots who kept discovering “the moment Trump became presidential” over and over again, unable to comprehend that his incompetence was as indelible as his corruption and malice, perhaps because their respect for the institution inexorably extended to the grifter who barged into it.) Centrist bias is institutional bias, and all our institutions historically perpetrated inequality. To recognize this is to delegitimize them; to deny it is to have it both ways – think yourself on the side of goodness while insisting no sweeping change is overdue. A far-right person might celebrate and perpetrate racism or police brutality or rape culture; a moderate might just play down its impact, past or present.</p> <p>To recognize the pervasiveness of sexual abuse is to have to listen to children as well as adults, women as well as men, subordinates as well as bosses: it’s to upend the old hierarchies of who should be heard and trusted, to break the silences that protect the legitimacy of the status quo. More than 95,000 people filed claims in the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2020/11/19/boy-scouts-bankruptcy-abuse/\">sexual-abuse lawsuit</a> against the Boy Scouts of America, and what it took to keep all those children quiet while all those hundreds of thousands of assaults took place is a lot of unwillingness to listen and to shatter faith in an institution that was itself so much part of the status quo (and in many ways an indoctrination system for it).</p> <p>Centrists in the antebellum era were apathetic or outright resistant to ending slavery in the US and then in the decades before 1920 to giving women the vote. The civil rights movement was not nearly as popular in its time as moderates who like the more polite quotes from Martin Luther King Jr think it was. King himself famously <a href=\"https://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html\">declared</a>, “I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro’s great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen’s Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to ‘order’ than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice …” As King notes, the status quo is always changing, and the centrists are often resistant to change that expands rights and justice, more mild about efforts by the right to shrink those things in favor of more inequality and more authoritarianism.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/118/20/e2022491118.abstract\">recent study</a> seems to contain the same biases, asserting, “We measured the brain activity of committed partisans watching real political video footage. Although all participants viewed the same videos, brain responses diverged between liberals and conservatives, reflecting differences in the subjective interpretation of the footage. This polarized perception was exacerbated by a personality trait: intolerance of uncertainty.” The research seems to assume that many at either end of the spectrum hold strong beliefs and are intolerant of uncertainty, but who is more intolerant of uncertainty than those who want to believe that authority is trustworthy, no secrets need sunlight, and urgent change is unwanted?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>What gets called the left is often just ahead of the game, when it comes to human rights and environmental justice</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Another fallacy of the centrist stance is that right and left are symmetrically extreme. Leftwing violence is largely a failed experiment that faded away in the 1970s. Too, in recent years the strongest voices on the left have mostly told important truths and those on the right have promulgated lies while arguing against basic human rights. One obvious example is all the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/03/lies-anti-abortion-laws-rebecca-solnit\">falsehoods about abortion</a> used to justify undermining abortion access. Another is the conversation around the climate crisis. Activists and scientists have been saying for a long time that we’re in a dire situation that demands profound change. Yet the call for change is painted as extreme – rather than as the necessary response to an extreme planetary crisis. On the right, the call has been for inaction and denial of the science. This week the <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-by-2050\">International Energy Agency</a> belatedly got on board with what <a href=\"http://priceofoil.org/2021/05/18/iea-bolsters-call-no-new-fossil-fuel/\">climate groups</a> have been insisting on for years: <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-international-energy-agency-issues-a-milestone-statement-about-fossil-fuels\">an end</a> to new fossil fuel exploration and extraction, a major shift now recognized as a reasonable and necessary one to preserve a liveable planet.</p> <p>Was it radical to be correct too soon? What gets called the left is often just ahead of the game, when it comes to human rights and environmental justice; the right is often denying the existence of the problem, whether it’s pesticides and toxic waste or domestic violence and child abuse. There is no symmetry. A lot of what are now considered moderate – AKA centrist – positions were seen as radical not long ago, when this country supported segregation, banned interracial marriages and then same-sex marriages, prevented women from holding some positions and queer people from others, and excluded disabled people from almost everything. The center is biased, and those biases matter.</p> <ul> <li><p>Rebecca Solnit is a Guardian US columnist.

Finally, this year US attorney general, Merrick Garland, called this terrorism by its true name and identified it as “the most dangerous threat to our democracy.” The constant assumption has been that crime and trouble comes from outsiders, from “them,” not “us,” which is why last summer’s Black Lives Matter protests were constantly portrayed by conservatives and sometimes the mainstream as far more violent and destructive than they were and the right has had such an easy time demonizing immigrants. What violence and destruction did take place in or adjacent to Black Lives Matter protests was often the work of the rightwing. That includes the murder of a guard at a federal court in Oakland, allegedly by an air force sergeant and Boogaloo Boy, while a BLM protest was going on nearby. It also reportedly includes some of the arson in Minneapolis shortly after George Floyd’s murder, as well as attacks on protesters. USA Today reported 104 such attacks by cars driven into crowds, many of them apparently politically motivated. No one has ever loved the status quo more than the editorial board at the New York Times, which recently composed an editorial declaring it a misstep for “the city’s Pride organizers … to reduce the presence of law enforcement at the celebration, including a ban on uniformed police and corrections officers marching as groups until at least 2025.” They found a lesbian of color who is also a cop and focused on this individual feeling “devastated,” rather than the logic behind the decision. Pride celebrates the uprising against longtime police violence and criminalization of queerness at the Stonewall Bar in 1969. Police officers are in no way banned from participating out of uniform, if they so desire, but that’s not enough for these “can’t we all get along” editorialists, who also wrote: “But barring LGBTQ officers from marching is a politicized response and is hardly worthy of the important pursuit of justice for those persecuted by the police.” You want to shout that the whole parade is political, because persecution and inequality have made being LGBTQ political, and the decision to include the police would be no less political than to exclude them. And who decides what’s worthy? The idea that there is some magically apolitical state all should aspire to is key to this bias and to why it refuses to recognize itself as a bias. It believes it speaks from neutral ground, which is why it forever describes a landscape of mountains and chasms as a level playing field. The status-quo bias is something I’ve encountered over and over again as gender violence, particularly as the refusal or inability to recognize that a high-status man or boy, be he film mogul or high-school football player, can also be a vicious criminal. Those who cannot believe the charges, no matter how credible, often dismiss and blame the victim instead (or worse: reporting a rape too often leads to death threats and other forms of harassment and intimidation intended to make an uncomfortable truth go away). Society has a marked failure of imagination when it comes to grasping that such predators treat their low-status victims in secret differently than their high-status peers in public, and that failure of imagination denies the existence of such inequality even as it perpetrates it. It’s a failure born out of undue respect for the powerful. (Here I think of all the idiots who kept discovering “the moment Trump became presidential” over and over again, unable to comprehend that his incompetence was as indelible as his corruption and malice, perhaps because their respect for the institution inexorably extended to the grifter who barged into it.) Centrist bias is institutional bias, and all our institutions historically perpetrated inequality. To recognize this is to delegitimize them; to deny it is to have it both ways – think yourself on the side of goodness while insisting no sweeping change is overdue. A far-right person might celebrate and perpetrate racism or police brutality or rape culture; a moderate might just play down its impact, past or present. To recognize the pervasiveness of sexual abuse is to have to listen to children as well as adults, women as well as men, subordinates as well as bosses: it’s to upend the old hierarchies of who should be heard and trusted, to break the silences that protect the legitimacy of the status quo. More than 95,000 people filed claims in the sexual-abuse lawsuit against the Boy Scouts of America, and what it took to keep all those children quiet while all those hundreds of thousands of assaults took place is a lot of unwillingness to listen and to shatter faith in an institution that was itself so much part of the status quo (and in many ways an indoctrination system for it). Centrists in the antebellum era were apathetic or outright resistant to ending slavery in the US and then in the decades before 1920 to giving women the vote. The civil rights movement was not nearly as popular in its time as moderates who like the more polite quotes from Martin Luther King Jr think it was. King himself famously declared, “I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro’s great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen’s Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to ‘order’ than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice …” As King notes, the status quo is always changing, and the centrists are often resistant to change that expands rights and justice, more mild about efforts by the right to shrink those things in favor of more inequality and more authoritarianism. A recent study seems to contain the same biases, asserting, “We measured the brain activity of committed partisans watching real political video footage. Although all participants viewed the same videos, brain responses diverged between liberals and conservatives, reflecting differences in the subjective interpretation of the footage. This polarized perception was exacerbated by a personality trait: intolerance of uncertainty.” The research seems to assume that many at either end of the spectrum hold strong beliefs and are intolerant of uncertainty, but who is more intolerant of uncertainty than those who want to believe that authority is trustworthy, no secrets need sunlight, and urgent change is unwanted? Another fallacy of the centrist stance is that right and left are symmetrically extreme. Leftwing violence is largely a failed experiment that faded away in the 1970s. Too, in recent years the strongest voices on the left have mostly told important truths and those on the right have promulgated lies while arguing against basic human rights. One obvious example is all the falsehoods about abortion used to justify undermining abortion access. Another is the conversation around the climate crisis. Activists and scientists have been saying for a long time that we’re in a dire situation that demands profound change. Yet the call for change is painted as extreme – rather than as the necessary response to an extreme planetary crisis. On the right, the call has been for inaction and denial of the science. This week the International Energy Agency belatedly got on board with what climate groups have been insisting on for years: an end to new fossil fuel exploration and extraction, a major shift now recognized as a reasonable and necessary one to preserve a liveable planet. Was it radical to be correct too soon? What gets called the left is often just ahead of the game, when it comes to human rights and environmental justice; the right is often denying the existence of the problem, whether it’s pesticides and toxic waste or domestic violence and child abuse. There is no symmetry. A lot of what are now considered moderate – AKA centrist – positions were seen as radical not long ago, when this country supported segregation, banned interracial marriages and then same-sex marriages, prevented women from holding some positions and queer people from others, and excluded disabled people from almost everything. The center is biased, and those biases matter. Rebecca Solnit is a Guardian US columnist. She is also the author of Men Explain Things to Me and The Mother of All Questions.

has said it is ready to use a Covid-19 travel certificate before its EU-wide launch on 1 July to attract foreign travellers and save its tourism sector from a second summer lost to the coronavirus. Spain’s prime minister Pedro Sanchez also confirmed his country would take part in the trials from 7 June. “This will be decisive in getting the certificate ready before summer begins and is big news for our tourism industry.” The deputy prime minister of Ireland, Leo Varadkar, has said that Irish citizens should be able move more freely across the European Union from mid-July, but cast doubt on whether it would also apply to Britain. South Africa is in a race against time to vaccinate as many people as possible amid signs the virus may be surging again with the approach of winter in the southern hemisphere, when people spend more time indoors, typically allowing for more spread of disease. Japan is expected to extend emergency coronavirus measures in Tokyo and several other regions by about three weeks, according to officials, as the country struggles to rein in a fourth wave of infections less than two months before the Olympics. Japan said it would consider sharing its Covid vaccines with other countries as a ruling party committee urged it to provide a portion of its AstraZeneca vaccine stock to Taiwan. Japan has also today approved the use of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine for those aged 12 and above. Weeks into Taiwan’s worst outbreak since the pandemic began, and 10 days after the island was put on the third highest level of social restrictions, daily totals of new cases are still not decreasing, the health minister has conceded. India reported on Friday 186,364 new coronavirus infections during the previous 24 hours, for its lowest daily rise since April 14, while deaths rose by 3,660. The south Asia region - India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Bhutan, Nepal, Maldives and Sri Lanka – accounts for 18% of global cases and almost 10% of deaths according to analysis by Reuters. The region has exceeded 30 million cases in total. Australia’s government is scrambling to administer first doses of Covid vaccines to unvaccinated aged care homes across Victoria on the first day of a week-long lockdown. Overcrowding in Victoria’s healthcare system is a “bigger public health emergency than Covid”, according to a leading emergency physician who says the state’s doctors and nurses were exhausted even before the latest outbreak in Australia. Czech restaurants will open to indoor diners from Monday. The Czech Republic will also open up to tourists from seven countries – Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia, Croatia, Austria and Germany – under reciprocal agreements. A €2.5bn (£2.15bn) package has been agreed by Germany’s government to help the culture industry get back on its feet as the country slowly emerges from a third wave of the Covid pandemic. The UK business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, has defended health secretary Matt Hancock against criticism that he failed to protect people in care homes at the outset of the Covid pandemic, saying residents “were protected as far as we could”. Professor Christina Pagel, from University College London and a member of Independent Sage, said the India variant was causing concern in England and the road map for reopening the economy should be delayed. Murdo Fraser of the Scottish Conservatives has criticised the continued restrictions in place across Glasgow. He has said if the latest data shows infections are still high then a “more targeted” approach was needed in Scotland. A royal academy chaired by Princess Chulabhorn, the youngest sibling of Thailand’s king, has said it would import 1 million doses of Sinopharm’s Covid-19 vaccine next month, after the Food and Drug Administration authorised its use. The Philippines has suspended the deployment of workers to Saudi Arabia after it received reports that their employers and recruiters were making them pay for Covid-19 testing, quarantine and insurance upon arrival in the kingdom. Russia has registered the world’s first vaccine for animals against Covid, its agricultural regulator said on Wednesday, after tests showed it generated antibodies against the virus in dogs, cats, foxes and mink Health ministers around the world are being urged to sign off on plans to create 6m more nursing jobs by 2030, amid warnings that Covid-19 has exacerbated a global shortage and could spark a “brain drain” from the developing world. That’s it from me, Martin Belam. I will be back on Tuesday. Harry Taylor has our UK live blog, Mattha Busby will be joining you here shortly to carry on bringing you the latest global Covid developments. The Philippines has suspended the deployment of workers to Saudi Arabia after it received reports that their employers and recruiters were making them pay for Covid-19 testing, quarantine and insurance upon arrival in the kingdom. Reuters report that Labour secretary Silvestre Bello said in an order that his department will issue an official statement on resumption of deployment “after this matter has been clarified accordingly”. It was not immediately clear how many Filipinos bound for Saudi Arabia would be directly affected. Saudi Arabia was the most preferred destination of overseas Filipino workers in 2019, government data showed, hosting one out of five Filipinos who landed jobs abroad during that year. The Scott Morrison government in Australia was scrambling to administer first doses of Covid vaccines to unvaccinated aged care homes across Victoria on the first day of a week-long lockdown, as federal ministers rejected criticism of the programme’s rollout. Facilities hurriedly prepared residents for rushed vaccines on Friday as the commonwealth raced to vaccinate neglected populations within the highest priority group it had initially promised to two months ago. The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, had said on Thursday there were 74 residential aged care homes across Australia that had not yet received an initial dose of Covid vaccine, including 16 in Victoria. But he went on a media blitz on Friday morning insisting every aged care home in the state would have received at least one dose by the weekend. The government’s push to vaccinate the remaining aged care homes in Victoria came a day after Hunt announced the recommended two-week interval between flu and Covid shots would be scrapped for aged care settings in Victoria. The operator of one aged care home in Melbourne, who asked not to be identified, told Guardian Australia they were surprised to learn vaccination teams were being sent to their facility on Friday. It presented logistical hurdles to prepare residents at such short notice, they said. Read more here: Federal government scrambles to vaccinate Victorian aged care homes as state enters first day of lockdown My colleague Haroon Siddique has a fuller write-up of those quotes from the UK business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng that we were carrying on this blog earlier: Kwasi Kwarteng defends Hancock over Covid care home claims As a reminder, UK Covid news is now being blogged by Harry Taylor over here: A royal academy chaired by Princess Chulabhorn, the youngest sibling of Thailand’s king, has said it would import 1m doses of Sinopharm’s Covid-19 vaccine next month, after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorised its use. The announcement in the official Royal Gazette surprised some members of the government, which had until now insisted on being the sole importer of Covid-19 vaccines. The FDA on Friday approved the Sinopharm coronavirus vaccine for emergency use, making it the fifth authorised by Thailand after AstraZenaca, Sinovac’s CoronaVac, Johnson &amp; Johnson’s Janssen and Moderna “We want to help plug in the gaps for business, schools, so they can move forward,” Nithi Mahanonda, secretarygeneral of the Chulabhorn Royal Academy told a news briefing. Reuters report that earlier this week, the academy announced it would import “alternative vaccines” to supplement the government campaign. The government says it will have 6m AstraZenaca doses and 3 million Sinovac doses available in June. Just over 1 million of Thailand’s more than 66 million people are fully vaccinated. Nithi said other organisations would be able to buy from the academy’s 1m Sinopharm doses, adding that it did not seek profit. Greece has said it is ready to use a Covid-19 travel certificate before its EU-wide launch on 1 July to attract foreign travellers and save its tourism sector from a second summer lost to the coronavirus. The free certificate will take the form of a QR code on a smartphone or paper, letting authorities determine the status of a visitor based on records in their home EU country. Greece was one of the early advocates of a certificate that would ease European Union travel curbs and help pull the country’s economy from recession by lifting tourism revenues. The European Council and parliament last week reached a deal on the digital green certificate following a rapid pick-up of vaccinations allowing widespread lifting of coronavirus curbs. The European parliament is expected to pass a law in the week from 7 June and more than a dozen EU countries, including France and Spain, have agreed to test the system before a launch on 1 July. The certificate would show if a person had received a vaccine, had a recent negative test or had immunity based on recovery. “It is very, very simple. Essentially, it includes all the information that a member-state would need to welcome a traveller without imposing additional restrictions,” Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said at a presentation of the pass on Friday. Lefteris Papadimas and Angeliki Koutantou report for Reuters that Mitsotakis added: “Greece is ready to launch this digital certificate earlier than 1 July.” He called on EU countries to ensure they stick to the deadlines and facilitate travel over the summer. In a separate event in the northern Spanish city of Soria, Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez also confirmed his country would take part in the trials from 7 June. “This will be decisive in getting the certificate ready before summer begins and is big news for our tourism industry.” South Africa is in a race against time to vaccinate as many people as possible amid signs the virus may be surging again with the approach of winter in the southern hemisphere, when people spend more time indoors, typically allowing for more spread of disease. It is also a critical front in the fight against the virus in Africa, with South Africa recording 40% of the continent’s Covid-19 deaths. Since January, South Africa has vaccinated nearly 500,000 of its 1.2 million healthcare workers and now is adding its older citizens to the campaign. In the past two weeks, nearly 200,000 have received their Pfizer jabs with instructions to come back in six weeks to get their second dose. After a plateau of the disease that lasted a few months, South Africa’s new cases, hospitalisations and deaths are trending up. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases has risen over the past two weeks from 3.33 per 100,000 people on 12 May to 3.97 per 100,000 on Wednesday, according to Johns Hopkins University. The seven-day rolling average of deaths is also on the rise: from 0.10 deaths per 100,000 people to 0.11 per 100,000 over the same period. The increase may seem small, but experts warn it may be the start of a resurgence as the country enters the colder winter months, which start in June. The national coronavirus task force met this week and President Cyril Ramaphosa’s government is pondering the possibility of reimposing restrictions, such as reducing the hours that alcohol can be sold and limiting the number of people at gatherings. “We’re under pressure to reach higher levels of vaccination,” Mosa Moshabela, professor of public health at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, told the Associated Press. “New vaccination centers are opening every day and the numbers being given shots should quickly go from 20,000 elderly per day to 50,000 and then 100,000 per day,” he said. “By June we should reach 200,000 per day. We need to have that kind of volume to get close to vaccinating 5 million elderly by the end of June.” South Africa’s overall goal is to vaccinate 67% of its 60 million people by February. Czech restaurants will open to indoor diners from Monday, health minister Adam Vojtech said this morning, announcing a quicker-than-planned easing of Covid-19 restrictions. Reuters report that the Czech Republic will also open up to tourists from seven countries – Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia, Croatia, Austria and Germany – under reciprocal agreements. Harry Taylor is on our UK live blog duties this morning, and he’s just got that started for the day. If you are after UK news, then you can follow that with him here … I’ll be continuing here with the latest global coronavirus news. The deputy prime minister of Ireland, Leo Varadkar, has said that Irish citizens should be able move more freely across the European Union from mid-July, but cast doubt on whether it would also apply to Britain. “The advice that we have, and we’re accepting this advice, is that there are real concerns about the Indian variant and for that reason, we’re not in a position to restore the common travel area just yet,” Varadkar told national broadcaster RTE. Reuters report he said there would continue to be restrictions for arrivals from Britain, including requirements to have a vaccine or a negative Covid-19 test, even once travel opens up using the EU’s “green certificate”. Very quick snap from Reuters that a Japanese health ministry panel has approved the use of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine for those aged 12 and above. The move, which lowers the threshold from 16, follows approvals in the US and other nations this month for the vaccine to be used for adolescents. On the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, UK business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng was pushed on the issue of people being discharged from hospital to care homes without testing. He was fairly steadfast in repeatedly saying that testing capacity had to be built from scratch, and that is what Matt Hancock and the department did. Weeks into Taiwan’s worst outbreak since the pandemic began, and 10 days after the island was put on the third highest level of social restrictions, daily totals of new cases are still not decreasing, the health minister has conceded. In today’s daily press conference, minister Chen Chih-shung reported 19 new deaths, 297 new cases and an additional 258 cases from a backlog of cases stretching as far as 10 days. He said the trends appeared stable, and were not rising, but the fact they were not visibly decreasing suggested there was still unidentified spread. The 19 deaths is the third consecutive record for daily fatalities. Taiwan is currently on alert level 3, of a four-tier system. Recreation, entertainment and sporting venues have closed, restaurants ordered to do take-away only, and working from home encouraged but not enforced. The backlog of cases has made assessment of trends - and the effectiveness of the response measures - difficult, with up to 95 cases at a time being added to previous daily totals. For the first time in this outbreak, Chen has flagged a possible move to level 4, requiring a lockdown. Until now he has said it would not happen unless there were 14 consecutive days of more than 100 cases (which has happened) and a rate of at least 50% untraced (which has not happened). He said they need to get a clearer picture of the trends, and would have more information early next week. Chen also announced local governments would be allowed to facilitate their own vaccine purchases, with FDA approval, acknowledging the central government’s processes were not procuring fast enough to meet Taiwan’s needs in the context of the current outbreak. About 330,000 people have received at least one vaccine so far, from a population of 24 million. Taiwan’s hospitals have also been told to double their Covid patient capacity by allowing two patients to a room, instead of one. A €2.5bn (£2.15bn) package has been agreed by the German government to help the culture industry get back on its feet as the country slowly emerges from a third wave of the Covid pandemic. The finance minister, Olaf Scholz, has called the package “the biggest cultural subsidy programme” since the end of the second world war. The coronavirus cultural fund is intended to give organisers of events assurances that they will be compensated if performances and concerts are not able to go ahead as planned, as well as making up for the loss of ticket sales due to reduced seating as a result of social distancing regulations. Initially the measures will protect events of up to 500 participants, so that if from 1 July an event has to be cancelled, the organiser will be fully compensated. From the end of August, in anticipation of events being able to increase in size, that will go up to 2,000 participants. The measures, coming as Germany starts to open up after months of tight restrictions, are on top of a multimillion-euro neustart kultur (new start culture) programme announced last year to cover events across the country. “Life is starting again after a long coronavirus winter,” Scholz said. Monika Grütters, the culture minister, said the fund sent a signal to the cultural industry that its “resuscitation deserves the same amount of effort which is being given to other branches”. Read more of Kate Connolly’s report from Berlin: Germany agrees €2.5bn package to help revive Covid-hit culture sector Yesterday UK housing minister Robert Jenrick was touting next spring as a possible starting date for a Covid inquiry. Opposition Labour MP David Lammy has just joined calls to rapidly bring that date forward in the light of the revelations from Dominic Cummings earlier in the week. Meanwhile on LBC, shock-jock Nick Ferrari has been lambasting business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng saying he should be “kicking the door down” of the prime minister, “banging the desk and saying ‘We have got to stick to 21 June, prime minister!’”. Kwarteng replies “You know what Nick, that’s exactly what I’m doing.” The rest of his answer doesn’t make it sound like he is doing that, however, as he reiterates form his earlier media appearances that “What I can’t do is give guarantees on the 28 May” and continues to hold the line that the government will be following the data and there will not be a decision until 14 June. Mario Koran reports for us from Milwaukee that Wisconsin is the ground zero of America’s battle against vaccine hesitancy: Vaccination rates in Wisconsin vary widely between rural and urban areas and political, religious and racial divides – a pattern that mirrors the divide across the nation. In the progressive stronghold of Dane county – home to the University of Wisconsin-Madison – more than 65% of the population has received one dose. In the state’s rural north, Taylor county has vaccinated only 23.5% of the population, state data shows. Vaccine availability once posed the biggest barrier to immunization. But as availability increased, demand plateaued. Now, healthcare professionals are strategizing ways to reach those who haven’t yet been vaccinated but remain open to it. “Most of our rural residents have the information they need about where and when to get vaccinated. So this is no longer primarily an issue about access to the vaccine. It truly is an issue of what is commonly called vaccine hesitancy,” said Tim Size, executive director of the Rural Wisconsin Health Cooperative, a network of 43 rural hospitals. “I’m not talking about those who just say hell will freeze over before they get the vaccine. That’s not where I think any of us probably need to spend our energy because it’s unlikely to get much traction. I’m talking about the number of people who are communicating that they’re not quite ready yet, but with more information and conversation, they may get there.” Read more of Mario Koran’s report from Milwaukee here: Wisconsin: ground zero of America’s battle against vaccine hesitancy Prof Christina Pagel, from University College London and a member of Independent Sage, said the India variant was causing concern and the road map should be delayed. She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “Certainly we have weakened the link significantly between cases and hospitalisations, but we haven’t broken it.” She added: “We now have fewer restrictions in England than we’ve had since the pandemic started, so if enough people get infected, even a really small proportion who need hospital can still end up being quite large absolute numbers.” Asked whether the planned further lockdown easing for 21 June should not go ahead, she said: “So far we’ve kind of been crossing our fingers a little bit, Sage and Public Health England both say it’s a more transmissible variant, we know it has some levels of vaccine escape. “So we’re in a situation where, compared to two months ago, we now have a dominant variant, it transmits faster, and our vaccines are less effective against it.” PA Media reports that asked if it would be “very demoralising” to remain as we are now, she said: “I think what’s demoralising is having a third wave. If we can just delay international travel, delay stage 4 of the road map until we have a much higher proportion of people vaccinated with two doses, we’re in a much, much better position. “We’re only two months away from that, it’s not long to wait. What I don’t want is for us to have new restrictions.” In the UK, business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has become the latest minister to defend health secretary Matt Hancock, saying “Very few people – if anyone – worked as hard as he did.” Hancock had an awkward time in front of parliament yesterday following accusations by former government adviser Dominic Cummings that he had lied to colleagues and the public during the early stages of the pandemic. Kwarteng said: “I think what Matt stressed very carefully yesterday was that he was absolutely focused, right from the start of the pandemic, on saving people’s lives. “He was in a difficult situation as the Health Secretary, in a pandemic, the like of which we hadn’t seen for 100 years. He was under huge pressure. “And as a Cabinet colleague, I know that he worked really hard and very few people - if anyone - worked as hard as he did and he was very committed to saving lives. Now, he said what he said, I fully believe him but we’ll have an inquiry and that will iron out all these facts.” Poulomi Ghosh reports for the Hindustan Times on a vaccine mix-up causing concern: At least 20 people in Uttar Pradesh’s Siddharthnagar district bordering Nepal were administered with different doses of vaccines, in a case of “negligence”. The 20 people who received two different vaccines in two slots are all from Audahi Kalan village and are aged above 45 years. On 1 April, there were given a dose of Covishield, which was their first dose. On 14 May, they were administered the second dose and as the health workers did not check the card to find out which vaccine was administered to them earlier, they were given Covaxin, by mistake. Reports said none of them reported any adverse effect. There are controlled trials ongoing in some countries of mixing vaccines to see if it increases effectiveness. Murdo Fraser of the Scottish Conservatives has criticised the continued restrictions in place across Glasgow. PA Media reports that he has said if the latest data shows infections are still high then a “more targeted” approach was needed. Areas of Glasgow with higher concentrations of coronavirus infections should be targeted with testing and vaccinations rather than the whole city being subject to “blanket” restrictions, the Scottish Conservatives have said. Fraser told the BBC’s Good Morning Scotland: “Our view is the current council-wide lockdown in Glasgow has not been the right approach. “Large parts of Glasgow do not see large numbers of people infected with Covid and yet are affected by these lockdown restrictions. “If the data is still showing a specific problem in Glasgow what we should be doing is isolating that problem … localised surge testing, accelerating vaccinations in those communities and greater support for local businesses who have been really suffering.” Glasgow has been under strict coronavirus restrictions for 270 days and is the only part of the country under tougher Level 3 constraints. An update on restrictions in Scotland’s largest city is expected later today from first minister Nicola Sturgeon. Overcrowding in Victoria’s healthcare system is a “bigger public health emergency than Covid”, according to a leading emergency physician who says the state’s doctors and nurses were exhausted even before the latest outbreak. Victoria is in a seven-day lockdown with 30 cases of community transmission, more than 120 exposure sites, and 15,000 primary and secondary contacts of cases in isolation. The Australasian College for Emergency Medicine Victoria faculty chair, Dr Mya Cubitt, said on Friday that doctors and nurses in public hospitals had been dreading such a situation because they were still recovering from Victoria’s second wave in 2020. At its height, there were more than 700 new cases in a single day. There were 768 deaths overall with hundreds of healthcare workers infected. “We are in the worst crisis that healthcare has faced in many years,” Cubitt said. “You could even say – and I’d love to speak with [chief health officer Prof] Brett Sutton about this – that the access block and overcrowding of the system is the bigger public health emergency at the moment. Whether we have a Covid outbreak or not, emergency clinicians, and all of the many colleagues that we intersect with in the healthcare system, are under extreme pressure.” Read more of Melissa Davey’s report here: Overcrowding in Victorian hospitals ‘bigger emergency than Covid’, expert warns Sky News have just posted a clip of that Kwasi Kwarteng interview on Twitter. Reuters have been looking at the impact of Covid in the South Asia region, and have found that the tally of cases there, according to their figures, passed 30 million today. They report that the south Asia region - India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Bhutan, Nepal, Maldives and Sri Lanka – accounts for 18% of global cases and almost 10% of deaths. But there is growing suspicion that official tallies of infections and deaths are not reflecting the true extent of the problem. India’s decision to halt the export of vaccines until at least October has had a knock-on effect, with other South Asia countries such as Nepal and Bangladesh making diplomatic efforts to secure Covid-19 vaccines to prop up their faltering inoculation drives as their stocks run out. India’s western neighbour Pakistan, with purchases and donations from China and allocations from the World Health Organisation and the GAVI Vaccine Alliance, has now secured more than 18m doses. Pakistan has opened its vaccination campaign to everyone aged 19 or older. As I mentioned, business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has been on Sky News, and he was rather downbeat when asked about the prospects for the roadmap out of lockdown. He said: We don’t want to proceed with the roadmap without considering all the information that we have. I think that the numbers of cases, is a matter of concern. Today’s the 28th of May. It’s impossible for anyone to know what the situation will be like in a week or two weeks time. On the positive side, he said “the other thing that’s very helpful and encouraging, is the fact that the numbers of hospitalizations, and the number of fatalities as well, is considerably lower than it was even just two months ago” Ultimately he keep reiterating that the UK government would be guided by data: There’s lots of facts that we have to consider. I, as business secretary, I’m very committed to try to reopen on 21 June, I can’t guarantee that. And as I’ve said, we’re looking at the data, every day. The UK government dashboard shows that cases, deaths and hospitalisations are all going up, albeit at much lower levels than they were at the height of the pandemic. Kwarteng confirmed that there would be no decision before 14 June. Good morning from London, it is Martin Belam here – you can get in touch with me at martin.belam@theguardian.com. The UK’s business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng looks to have drawn the short straw for media duties this morning – he’ll be on Sky News in a few moments. While we wait for that, here’s Lizzy Davies on calls for 6m more nurses worldwide: Health ministers around the world are being urged to sign off on plans to create 6m more nursing jobs by 2030, amid warnings that Covid-19 has exacerbated a global shortage and could spark a “brain drain” from the developing world. Delegates meeting virtually this week at the World Health Assembly, the key decision-making body of the World Health Organization, are expected to adopt a resolution calling on countries to transform the nursing profession through more investment, support and training. The WHO director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, called on countries to invest in healthcare workers, nearly 50% of whom are nurses and midwives, saying the pandemic had reminded everyone “that these are incredible people doing incredible jobs under incredible circumstances”. “We owe them so much, and yet globally health and care workers often lack the protection, the equipment, the training, the decent pay, the safe working conditions and the respect they deserve,” he said in his opening remarks. “If we have any hope of achieving a healthier, safer, fairer future, every member state must protect and invest in its health and care workforce as a matter of urgency.” Read more here: ‘Protect and invest’: WHO calls for 6m more nurses worldwide That’s it from me, Helen Sullivan, for today. And if, for a break from pandemic news, you’d like to see a praying mantis wearing “tiny homemade 3D glasses”, might I suggest: Russia has registered the world’s first vaccine for animals against Covid, its agricultural regulator said on Wednesday, after tests showed it generated antibodies against the virus in dogs, cats, foxes and mink, Reuters reports. Mass production of the vaccine, called Carnivac-Cov, can start in April, regulator Rosselkhoznadzor said. The World Health Organization has expressed concern over the transmission of the virus between humans and animals. The regulator said the vaccine would be able to protect vulnerable species and thwart viral mutations. Russia has so far only registered two cases of Covid among animals, both in cats. Denmark culled all 17 million mink on its farms last year after concluding that a strain of the virus had passed from humans to mink and that mutated strains of the virus had then turned up among people. Rosselkhoznadzor said Russian fur farms planned to buy the vaccine, along with businesses in Greece, Poland and Austria. Russia’s fur farm industry accounts for around 3% of the global market, down from 30% in the Soviet era, according to the main trade body. Thailand’s food and drug regulator on Friday approved for emergency use the coroanvirus vaccine developed by China’s Sinopharm, Reuters reports, citing a senior official. “The FDA has approved the Sinopharm vaccine,” senior health official Paisan Dankhum told a news conference, making it the fifth Covid-19 vaccine Thailand has approved. Japanese shares jumped on Friday, as investors scooped up stocks after sell-offs due to MSCI’s reshuffle in the previous session, while progress in the country’s vaccination drive lifted risk appetite on prospects of a swift economic recovery, Reuters reports. The Nikkei share average crossed the 29,000 level for the first time since 11 May, jumping 1.95% to 29,106.86, as of 0205 GMT. The index is poised for a weekly gain of 2.8%. Rollouts of Covid vaccines have contributed to positive sentiment as investors hope a steady vaccination drive can help accelerate economic recovery, market participants said. Japan said on Friday it would consider sharing its Covid vaccines with other countries as a ruling party committee urged it to provide a portion of its AstraZeneca Plc vaccine stock to Taiwan, Reuters reports. Taiwan is battling a spike in domestic infections and has vaccinated only about 1% of its population, while Japan has secured more than 400 million doses, double what it needs for its adult population. “We think it’s important to ensure fair access to safe and effective vaccines in every country and region towards achieving universal health coverage,” Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato told a news conference. “We will swiftly consider and look into a concrete course of policy with regard to how we provide other countries and regions with vaccines that exceed the amount for those needed at home. Masahisa Sato, the head of a Japanese ruling party committee on Taiwan relations, said earlier on Friday the government should provide Taiwan with vaccines as soon as possible, adding “when Japan was in need Taiwan sent us 2 million masks.” Kato declined to comment whether Tokyo had received supply requests from specific countries. India reported on Friday 186,364 new coronavirus infections during the previous 24 hours, for its lowest daily rise since April 14, while deaths rose by 3,660. The South Asian nation’s tally of infections now stands at 27.56 million, with the death toll at 318,895, health ministry data show. Japan is expected to extend emergency coronavirus measures in Tokyo and several other regions by about three weeks, according to officials, as the country struggles to rein in a fourth wave of infections less than two months before the Olympics. The state of emergency – the third in the capital since the start of the pandemic – was called in late April and was originally due to end on 11 May, but was extended until the end of this month, as restrictions on businesses failed to make a dent in infections. Media reports said the latest extension could last until 20 June. Infections have fallen in Tokyo in recent days, but the daily caseload is still too high to justify an end to the measures, according to medical experts, while hospitals are contending with a record number of critically ill Covid-19 patients: Hello and welcome to today’s live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic with me, Helen Sullivan. As always, you can get in touch with me on Twitter @helenrsullivan. India reported on Friday 186,364 new coronavirus infections during the previous 24 hours, for its lowest daily rise since April 14, while deaths rose by 3,660. The South Asian nation’s tally of infections now stands at 27.56 million, with the death toll at 318,895, health ministry data show. Meanwhile Japan is expected to extend emergency coronavirus measures in Tokyo and several other regions by about three weeks, according to officials, as the country struggles to rein in a fourth wave of infections less than two months before the Olympics. Here are the key developments from the last few hours: Argentina reported a record one-day number of new Covid-19 cases of 41,080 on Thursday, amid a second wave of infections that has made the country one of the hardest hit in the world, pushing the local health care system to its limit. Africa needs at least 20m doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine within six weeks if those who have had their first shot are to get the second in time, the WHO said on Thursday. Up to three-quarters of new UK Covid cases are thought to be caused by the variant first detected in India, as the reported number more than doubled to almost 7,000, Matt Hancock said on Thursday. The United States called on Thursday for the World Health Organization to carry out a second phase of its investigation into the origins of the coronavirus, with independent experts given full access to original data and samples in China. The US intelligence community acknowledged its agencies had two theories on where Covid-19 originated, with an element embracing a possible laboratory accident as the source of the pandemic. US President Joe Biden said he is likely to release a report detailing the US intelligence community’s findings on the origins of Covid-19 in full. Sweden will go forward with its plan to ease some of its Covid curbs from June 1, prime minister Stefan Lofven said. Germany plans to make enough Covid vaccine doses available to offer a first shot to all children aged 12 and over by the end of August, a draft health ministry document showed.","charCount":"36728","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/mattha-busby\">Mattha Busby</a> (now); <a href=\"profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a> and <a href=\"profile/helen-sullivan\">Helen Sullivan</a> (earlier)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2021/may/28/us-capitol-attack-suspects-jail-trial","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-28T10:00:01Z","webTitle":"Revealed: majority of people charged in Capitol attack aren’t in jail","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/28/us-capitol-attack-suspects-jail-trial","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2021/may/28/us-capitol-attack-suspects-jail-trial","fields":{"headline":"Revealed: majority of people charged in Capitol attack aren’t in jail","standfirst":"<p>At least 70% have been released as they await hearings – compared with a typical rate of 25% of federal defendants</p>","trailText":"At least 70% have been released as they await hearings – compared with a typical rate of 25% of federal defendants","byline":"Lois Beckett in Los Angeles","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"08e24ac458c345bbf2f733cf23efe503981591e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08e24ac458c345bbf2f733cf23efe503981591e7/0_159_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police release teargas into a crowd of pro-Trump rioters on 6 January at the US Capitol.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police release teargas into a crowd of pro-Trump rioters on 6 January at the US Capitol.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shannon Stapleton/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>At least 70% of people charged in the Capitol riot have been released as they wait for trial, according to a Guardian analysis.</p> <p>That high pretrial release rate stands in stark contrast with the usual detention rates in the federal system, where only<a href=\"https://www.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/data_tables/jb_h14_0930.2019.pdf\"> 25% of defendants nationwide</a> are typically released before their trial.</p> <p>Eric Munchel, known as “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/10/us-capitol-mob-rioters-arrests-violence-brutality\">Zip Tie Guy</a>”, who was allegedly photographed wearing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/10/us-capitol-mob-rioters-arrests-violence-brutality\">tactical gear and carrying wrist restraints</a> in the Senate chamber, was released in late March, along with his mother, after an appeals court <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/26/capitol-riot-defendants-win-appeals-court-478157\">questioned whether he posed any danger</a> outside the specific context of 6 January.</p> <p>Richard Barnett, the Arkansas man photographed with his foot on Nancy Pelosi’s desk, was <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/legal-issues/pelosi-desk-rioter-released/2021/04/27/9fb5f3f8-a797-11eb-8d25-7b30e74923ea_story.html\">released in late April</a>, nearly two months after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/05/us-capitol-riot-man-pelosi-feet-desk-richard-barnett\">screaming during a court hearing</a> that “it’s not fair” that he was still in custody when “everybody else who did things much worse are already home”.</p> <p>Multiple alleged members of the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers, two groups facing the most serious conspiracy charges related to their alleged plans for violence, have been released before trial, though some prominent leaders in these groups remain in custody.</p> <p>The disparity in pretrial detention rates highlights what legal experts said was a broader development in the 6 January cases: the likelihood that a substantial swathe of the alleged rioters may not serve any prison time at all, even if they are convicted or plead guilty.</p> <p>Many Capitol defendants are being released ahead of trial because they are facing relatively low-level charges, experts said, though other factors, including racial bias, may also play a role.</p> <p>“I’m both surprised and not surprised.

The comparison makes no sense.”</p> <p>Zunkel, a former federal defense attorney, argued that it was absolutely fair to ask why prosecutors and judges were making different detention decisions for drug and immigration cases than for the people charged with participating in the 6 January attack, who are <a href=\"https://d3qi0qp55mx5f5.cloudfront.net/cpost/i/docs/americas_insurrectionists_online_2021_04_23.pdf?mtime=1620142954\">more than 90% white</a>.</p> <p>More than 96% of the people charged with federal immigration crimes are Hispanic, and more than 70% of those charged with federal drug crimes are Hispanic and Black, Zunkel said, citing <a href=\"https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/research-and-publications/annual-reports-and-sourcebooks/2020/2020-Annual-Report-and-Sourcebook.pdf\">federal sentencing data</a>.</p> <p>“We have a problem with our system, something has gone wildly wrong, if we have a 75% detention rate nationwide, and we have a subset where we have a more than 70% release rate,” she said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/05/the-capitol-attack-treason\">Why aren't we calling the Capitol attack an act of treason?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Zunkel and a colleague, Judith P Miller, both former federal defense attorneys, said that the level of skepticism and care federal judges were bringing to the decision of whether Capitol defendants were truly dangerous enough to keep incarcerated was not at all the norm.</p> <p>The problem, they said, was not that judges were making the wrong call in releasing Capitol defendants, but that judges were not making similar calls for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/24/opinion/merrick-garland-bail-reform.html\">the majority of people in the federal system</a>.</p> <p>“For my Black and brown clients, it feels like they have to meet such an impossibly high threshold to be released,” Miller, a University of Chicago law professor, said. “The kind of sensitivity the courts have shown to the capitol defendants’ claims for relief – I wish some of that sensitivity would be shown more broadly.”</p> <p>The US attorney’s office for the District of Columbia declined to confirm how many Capitol defendants were currently in pretrial detention, noting that the number “has the potential to fluctuate frequently based on ongoing detention decisions”.</p> <p>By mid-May, <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/active-duty-us-marine-corps-officer-arrested-assault-federal-law-enforcement-officer\">at least 440 people had been arrested </a>on charges related to the 6 January Capitol breach, according to the justice department, including at least 125 charged with assaulting or impeding law enforcement.</p> <p>Of 398 defendants listed on the justice department’s Capitol breach case site as of 10 May, at least 330 were listed on the site, or in federal court records, as released from custody.

A Washington Post analysis of court documents in mid-May concluded that <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/05/13/capitol-rioters-sentencing/\">44% of the Capitol defendants faced only misdemeanor charges</a>.</p> <p>Some of the federal judges hearing the Capitol cases have expressed concern that certain defendants may have already spent more time in custody than they are likely to face as a punishment for their crimes.</p> <p>“For those who end up only charged with misdemeanors, it’s likely that they won’t serve any substantial time, or potentially no time at all,” said Mary McCord, an expert on extremism who served for nearly 20 years as a prosecutor in the US attorney’s office in Washington DC. “It’s quite possible if they were to plead guilty, they would be sentenced to whatever time was served, or 30 days.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6c65636297fe11a0eaca463d0ec9d7b59a1797bf\"> <img

</figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is a tension between the dramatic collective effect of the 6 January mob, which halted the official certification of Biden’s election as president and threatened the legitimacy of American democracy, legal experts said, and what federal prosecutors can prove that individual people did.</p> <p>“The irony is that we have so many laws – so many things are illegal – it’s somewhat surprising that they’re not able to find charges that are more serious,” Zunkel said.</p> <p>Some more serious potential charges, like conspiracy or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/05/the-capitol-attack-treason\">seditious conspiracy</a>, would require evidence of prior agreement to commit a crime that appears to be lacking for many participants in the chaotic Capitol mob, said Daniel Richman, a Columbia University law professor and former federal prosecutor.</p> <p>“When you look at each individual, what they did might amount to destruction of property or illegal entry, and that’s in all likelihood what they’ll be charged with, but the larger dimension of their participation in a massive attack falls by the wayside,” Richman said.</p> <p>Part of the current dynamic of the Capitol cases, Richman cautioned, was seeing the very normal limitations of the criminal justice system come up against the heightened expectations of a public who watched the shocking violence of 6 January unfold in real time.</p> <p>“Criminal prosecutions never end in these glorious accountability moments where everyone is satisfied that right was done,” Richman said.</p> <p>For many Capitol defendants facing these lower-level charges, justice department prosecutors did not even attempt to keep them detained ahead of trial, and they were quickly released on standard conditions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"422ac04d5da944cf482005cd1a4bfbdcbfcfb089\"> <img

judges eventually overruling them, particularly after the<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/30/jan-6-capitol-riot-jail-time-478440\"> pivotal appeals court ruling</a> questioning the detention of Munchel, the alleged “Zip Tie Guy”, and his mother, who both gave interviews talking about their willingness to engage in violence to further their beliefs but were not accused of any specific acts of violence or vandalism as they roamed the Capitol, wrist restraints in hand.</p> <p>“My guess is the judges who decided to release some of these folks on bond were thinking: on January 6, there were an ideal storm of conditions for these people to commit a crime, and now there aren’t those ideal conditions any more, so they’re not likely to do it again,” said Wanda Bertram, a communications strategist at the Prison Policy Initiative, a non-profit that focuses on the harms of mass incarceration.</p> <p>But the same logic could be applied to low-level crimes: “investing in people’s communities” to “create different conditions” that would make it unlikely for them to repeat the same behavior, Bertram said.</p> <p>“The treatment of the people who are involved in the Capitol riot should show us what is possible and what is logical in terms of how to treat people in the future.”</p> <p>Former prosecutors defended the justice department’s work in the Capitol cases, and said that the continuing effort to identify and arrest a large proportion of the hundreds of people who stormed the Capitol was a massive, demanding endeavor, and showed how much the government wanted to ensure that there were real consequences for participating in the attack.</p> <p>“They’ve been aggressive, and continue to be, in trying to find everybody who was at that riot,” said Laurie Levenson, a professor at Loyola Law School. “For the attorney general, numbers matter. It really matters that hundreds of people are held responsible.

That high pretrial release rate stands in stark contrast with the usual detention rates in the federal system, where only 25% of defendants nationwide are typically released before their trial. Eric Munchel, known as “Zip Tie Guy”, who was allegedly photographed wearing tactical gear and carrying wrist restraints in the Senate chamber, was released in late March, along with his mother, after an appeals court questioned whether he posed any danger outside the specific context of 6 January. Richard Barnett, the Arkansas man photographed with his foot on Nancy Pelosi’s desk, was released in late April, nearly two months after screaming during a court hearing that “it’s not fair” that he was still in custody when “everybody else who did things much worse are already home”. Multiple alleged members of the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers, two groups facing the most serious conspiracy charges related to their alleged plans for violence, have been released before trial, though some prominent leaders in these groups remain in custody. The disparity in pretrial detention rates highlights what legal experts said was a broader development in the 6 January cases: the likelihood that a substantial swathe of the alleged rioters may not serve any prison time at all, even if they are convicted or plead guilty. Many Capitol defendants are being released ahead of trial because they are facing relatively low-level charges, experts said, though other factors, including racial bias, may also play a role. “I’m both surprised and not surprised. Most of these people are white,” said Erica Zunkel, associate director of the Federal Criminal Justice Clinic at the University of Chicago Law School. “The majority of people in the federal system are people of color.” The US attorney’s office for the District of Columbia, which is prosecuting the cases, said in a statement that the alleged Capitol rioters were facing very different kinds of charges than most people in the federal system. “Comparing the per cent of January 6 defendants detained with the overall federal average is comparing apples and oranges,” a spokesperson for the office said. “The majority of federal defendants are charged with immigration or drug crimes, both of which are typically accompanied by detention. The January 6 defendants are charged with a variety of obstruction, assault, and trespassing charges. The comparison makes no sense.” Zunkel, a former federal defense attorney, argued that it was absolutely fair to ask why prosecutors and judges were making different detention decisions for drug and immigration cases than for the people charged with participating in the 6 January attack, who are more than 90% white. More than 96% of the people charged with federal immigration crimes are Hispanic, and more than 70% of those charged with federal drug crimes are Hispanic and Black, Zunkel said, citing federal sentencing data. “We have a problem with our system, something has gone wildly wrong, if we have a 75% detention rate nationwide, and we have a subset where we have a more than 70% release rate,” she said. Zunkel and a colleague, Judith P Miller, both former federal defense attorneys, said that the level of skepticism and care federal judges were bringing to the decision of whether Capitol defendants were truly dangerous enough to keep incarcerated was not at all the norm. The problem, they said, was not that judges were making the wrong call in releasing Capitol defendants, but that judges were not making similar calls for the majority of people in the federal system. “For my Black and brown clients, it feels like they have to meet such an impossibly high threshold to be released,” Miller, a University of Chicago law professor, said. “The kind of sensitivity the courts have shown to the capitol defendants’ claims for relief – I wish some of that sensitivity would be shown more broadly.” The US attorney’s office for the District of Columbia declined to confirm how many Capitol defendants were currently in pretrial detention, noting that the number “has the potential to fluctuate frequently based on ongoing detention decisions”. By mid-May, at least 440 people had been arrested on charges related to the 6 January Capitol breach, according to the justice department, including at least 125 charged with assaulting or impeding law enforcement. Of 398 defendants listed on the justice department’s Capitol breach case site as of 10 May, at least 330 were listed on the site, or in federal court records, as released from custody. At least 56 of those defendants remained in detention. The precise number and percentage of Capitol defendants who are released versus in detention changes often, as new alleged rioters are arrested, others secure release, and a few risk re-arrest for violating the conditions of their release. The number and status of cases on the justice department’s Capitol breach website also lags behind court filings. But the broader trend in the cases is clear: the overwhelming majority of Capitol defendants are not being detained ahead of trial. Based on their likelihood of flight risk or danger to their communities, some of the Capitol defendants have been required to meet more intensive release conditions, including GPS monitoring, curfews or home detention, and limitations on their access to the Internet or social media, according to court records. Many of the Capitol defendants are facing only relatively low-level federal charges, such as entering a restricted building or disorderly conduct within a restricted building. A Washington Post analysis of court documents in mid-May concluded that 44% of the Capitol defendants faced only misdemeanor charges. Some of the federal judges hearing the Capitol cases have expressed concern that certain defendants may have already spent more time in custody than they are likely to face as a punishment for their crimes. “For those who end up only charged with misdemeanors, it’s likely that they won’t serve any substantial time, or potentially no time at all,” said Mary McCord, an expert on extremism who served for nearly 20 years as a prosecutor in the US attorney’s office in Washington DC. “It’s quite possible if they were to plead guilty, they would be sentenced to whatever time was served, or 30 days.” There is a tension between the dramatic collective effect of the 6 January mob, which halted the official certification of Biden’s election as president and threatened the legitimacy of American democracy, legal experts said, and what federal prosecutors can prove that individual people did. “The irony is that we have so many laws – so many things are illegal – it’s somewhat surprising that they’re not able to find charges that are more serious,” Zunkel said. Some more serious potential charges, like conspiracy or seditious conspiracy, would require evidence of prior agreement to commit a crime that appears to be lacking for many participants in the chaotic Capitol mob, said Daniel Richman, a Columbia University law professor and former federal prosecutor. “When you look at each individual, what they did might amount to destruction of property or illegal entry, and that’s in all likelihood what they’ll be charged with, but the larger dimension of their participation in a massive attack falls by the wayside,” Richman said. Part of the current dynamic of the Capitol cases, Richman cautioned, was seeing the very normal limitations of the criminal justice system come up against the heightened expectations of a public who watched the shocking violence of 6 January unfold in real time. “Criminal prosecutions never end in these glorious accountability moments where everyone is satisfied that right was done,” Richman said. For many Capitol defendants facing these lower-level charges, justice department prosecutors did not even attempt to keep them detained ahead of trial, and they were quickly released on standard conditions. Federal prosecutors did fight for months to keep other defendants in custody, with federal judges eventually overruling them, particularly after the pivotal appeals court ruling questioning the detention of Munchel, the alleged “Zip Tie Guy”, and his mother, who both gave interviews talking about their willingness to engage in violence to further their beliefs but were not accused of any specific acts of violence or vandalism as they roamed the Capitol, wrist restraints in hand. “My guess is the judges who decided to release some of these folks on bond were thinking: on January 6, there were an ideal storm of conditions for these people to commit a crime, and now there aren’t those ideal conditions any more, so they’re not likely to do it again,” said Wanda Bertram, a communications strategist at the Prison Policy Initiative, a non-profit that focuses on the harms of mass incarceration. But the same logic could be applied to low-level crimes: “investing in people’s communities” to “create different conditions” that would make it unlikely for them to repeat the same behavior, Bertram said. “The treatment of the people who are involved in the Capitol riot should show us what is possible and what is logical in terms of how to treat people in the future.” Former prosecutors defended the justice department’s work in the Capitol cases, and said that the continuing effort to identify and arrest a large proportion of the hundreds of people who stormed the Capitol was a massive, demanding endeavor, and showed how much the government wanted to ensure that there were real consequences for participating in the attack. “They’ve been aggressive, and continue to be, in trying to find everybody who was at that riot,” said Laurie Levenson, a professor at Loyola Law School. “For the attorney general, numbers matter. It really matters that hundreds of people are held responsible. That’s the message to people: you don’t want to game the system.” “I think they pretty much want on everyone’s records that they were responsible for these actions,” Levenson added. “It means something that these people are going to walk away with even a federal misdemeanor record. That has an impact on their employment, on their life, on their situation in their community. Even if they just get probation, they’re going to have to watch their step.”","charCount":"10431","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/lois-beckett\">Lois Beckett</a> in Los Angeles"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2021/may/28/olivia-rodrigo-track-of-the-week","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-28T10:00:01Z","webTitle":"This week’s new tracks: Olivia Rodrigo, Liz Phair, the Goon Sax","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/may/28/olivia-rodrigo-track-of-the-week","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2021/may/28/olivia-rodrigo-track-of-the-week","fields":{"headline":"This week’s new tracks: Olivia Rodrigo, Liz Phair, the Goon Sax","standfirst":"<p>This week we’ve got a blast of punk-pop sunshine, a bruised ambient ballad, and some effortlessly-perfect indie pop<br></p>","trailText":"This week we’ve got a blast of punk-pop sunshine, a bruised ambient ballad, and some effortlessly-perfect indie pop<br>","byline":"Owen Myers","main":"","body":"<h2>Olivia Rodrigo</h2> <h2>Good 4 U</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNi_6U5Pm_o\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gNi_6U5Pm_o?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>If Rodrigo’s star-making Drivers License mournfully pored over mementos of a lost love, her new one douses the trinkets in kerosene and lets them burn.

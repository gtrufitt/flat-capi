National governments were also caught up: gov.uk was unavailable, making a host of government services inaccessible include the Covid vaccines booking site, as was the website for the White House.</p> <p>The affected sites all used Fastly as a content delivery network” (CDN), a service intended to provide greater reliability and performance for heavily trafficked websites.</p> <p>A CDN is a global network of servers, placed so that at least one server is close enough for a fast connection wherever a user lives. Customers like the Guardian send visitors to the CDN rather than their own servers, providing the content faster and protecting the website from being overloaded in the event of a spike in traffic.</p> <p>But a CDN can also serve as a single point of failure: if the network collapses, it can also block all traffic going to the websites it protects. CDNs are more efficient the larger they are, creating a concentration of power to the market.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2021/06/cache-servers/giv-825g0r83BQgOX74/\" data-alt=\"graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2021/06/cache-servers/giv-825g0r83BQgOX74/\">graphic</a> </figure>  <p>The vast majority of internet traffic is routed through one of three CDNs: Fastly, Cloudflare or Amazon’s CloudFront. David Warburton, of the cybersecurity company F5 Labs, said centralisation is relatively new in the history of the internet and is likely to continue to cause problems.</p> <p>“The web as a whole was intended to be decentralised,” he said. “By not relying on any one central system, it meant that many different components could fail and internet traffic could still find a way to get where it needed to go. What we’ve seen over the past decade, however, is the unintentional centralisation of many core services through large cloud solution providers like infrastructure vendors and CDNs.”</p> <p>Paddy McGuinness, who was deputy national security adviser responsible for intelligence security and resilience between 2014 and 2018, said the attack should be considered “a wakeup call” and politicians needed to broaden the existing security-driven approach as technology brings new services to the British public.</p> <p>“We need resilience as an explicit policy goal, especially on the new networks we are building to deliver services to the citizen,” said the former Whitehall insider, who worked under two prime ministers, David Cameron and Theresa May. “A ‘secure by design and default’ mantra is welcome but it isn’t enough in itself.” </p> <p>The intelligence agencies GCHQ and its cybersecurity arm the NCSC (National Cyber Security Centre) working alone “could not prevent disruption”, McGuiness argued, partly because a key part of their remit was to detect and prevent hostile state and hacker attacks, rather than ensuring the long-term stability of critical consumer services.</p> <p>The cost of such an outage can be enormous.

An unexplained configuration error at a single infrastructure provider, Fastly, which handles 10% of the world’s internet traffic, was enough to render major websites and services inoperable for almost an hour on Tuesday morning. Online businesses including Reddit, Amazon, Twitch, Spotify and Hulu were knocked offline, as was the Guardian’s website, the BBC, the New York Times, and CNN. National governments were also caught up: gov.uk was unavailable, making a host of government services inaccessible include the Covid vaccines booking site, as was the website for the White House. The affected sites all used Fastly as a content delivery network” (CDN), a service intended to provide greater reliability and performance for heavily trafficked websites. A CDN is a global network of servers, placed so that at least one server is close enough for a fast connection wherever a user lives. Customers like the Guardian send visitors to the CDN rather than their own servers, providing the content faster and protecting the website from being overloaded in the event of a spike in traffic. But a CDN can also serve as a single point of failure: if the network collapses, it can also block all traffic going to the websites it protects. CDNs are more efficient the larger they are, creating a concentration of power to the market. The vast majority of internet traffic is routed through one of three CDNs: Fastly, Cloudflare or Amazon’s CloudFront. David Warburton, of the cybersecurity company F5 Labs, said centralisation is relatively new in the history of the internet and is likely to continue to cause problems. “The web as a whole was intended to be decentralised,” he said. “By not relying on any one central system, it meant that many different components could fail and internet traffic could still find a way to get where it needed to go. What we’ve seen over the past decade, however, is the unintentional centralisation of many core services through large cloud solution providers like infrastructure vendors and CDNs.” Paddy McGuinness, who was deputy national security adviser responsible for intelligence security and resilience between 2014 and 2018, said the attack should be considered “a wakeup call” and politicians needed to broaden the existing security-driven approach as technology brings new services to the British public. “We need resilience as an explicit policy goal, especially on the new networks we are building to deliver services to the citizen,” said the former Whitehall insider, who worked under two prime ministers, David Cameron and Theresa May. “A ‘secure by design and default’ mantra is welcome but it isn’t enough in itself.” The intelligence agencies GCHQ and its cybersecurity arm the NCSC (National Cyber Security Centre) working alone “could not prevent disruption”, McGuiness argued, partly because a key part of their remit was to detect and prevent hostile state and hacker attacks, rather than ensuring the long-term stability of critical consumer services. The cost of such an outage can be enormous. In 2015, when the scale of the internet economy was a fraction of today’s, the cost of cloud service outages were estimated at almost $300m (about £210m) a year, says Prof Rebecca Parry, of Nottingham Law School. “Liability for loss of service will probably be covered by the ‘service level agreement’ with customers of paid-for cloud services,” Parry said, “but the agreements will typically not cover all losses sustained.” Chris Huggett, of Sungard Availability Services, said a typical Fastly customer is unlikely to receive more than $1,000 in refunded fees for the outage even if their true costs could be hundreds of times more. “With the average cost of downtime now $250,000 an hour, every minute counts.” In November 2020, AWS, Amazon’s cloud hosting arm, suffered a multi-hour outage in the middle of the US West Coast’s afternoon.

At the weekend, the UK prime minister said he would urge the G7 leaders to vaccinate the world against Covid by the end of next year.</p> <p>But is this feasible? That rather depends on your definition. No country will vaccinate every adult. Vaccinating enough to achieve herd immunity, which could be 60% or 70%, is the real aim. It is possible to achieve that by December 2023, say experts, but only if the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/g7\">G7</a> leading economies move immediately to make it happen.</p> <p>The Covax scheme under the UN umbrella should have been the route to vaccination for low-income countries. It was designed as their lifeline. Covax signed contracts with manufacturers to buy 2bn doses by the end of this year. But it is stymied. Its main supplier is the Serum Institute of India, which is now churning out vaccines in response to the terrible surge in domestic cases and deaths and will not be able to fulfil its contracts to Covax or individual countries before the end of the year.</p> <p>Dr Bruce Aylward, senior adviser to the director general of the World Health Organization, who is heavily involved in the vaccine efforts, said: “This is where the UK becomes really important and the G7, because right now we’ve got this gap of death. In June, July, August, September, there’s no vaccine out there for love nor money, in terms of being able to procure it.”</p> <p><strong>Read more of Sarah Boseley’s analysis here: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/jun/08/can-we-vaccinate-the-world-against-covid-by-the-end-of-2022\">Can we vaccinate the world against Covid by the end of 2022?</a></strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/jun/08/can-we-vaccinate-the-world-against-covid-by-the-end-of-2022\">Can we vaccinate the world against Covid by the end of 2022?</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60bf09cc8f08336d75f063b9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-08T06:14:13.214Z\">7.14am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The president of the <strong>Tokyo 2020</strong> organising committee, <strong>Seiko Hashimoto,</strong> is speaking this morning, and she is setting out some of the procedures that will be undertaken to try to keep the games safe.</p> <p>So far, she’s said that media will not be able to use shared accommodation, and that the media will be GPS-tracked to ensure they don’t go into unauthorised areas.

The Coalition has faced persistent criticism for failing to prepare for Covid-19 in aged care, including from the aged care royal commission, which found its actions were “insufficient to ensure preparedness” in the sector. Vaccine passports will be used for the first time at UK sporting events for England’s Euro 2020 group games at Wembley stadium, with those not fully vaccinated able to show proof of a negative lateral flow test taken within the previous 48 hours. World Bank president David Malpass said the institution does not support waiving intellectual property rights for Covid-19 vaccines at the World Trade Organization, claiming it is out of concern that it would hamper innovation in the pharmaceuticals sector. South Africa’s president Cyril Ramaphosa placed the country’s health minister on “special leave” over alleged links to a corruption scandal involving coronavirus communications funding. Pfizer is to begin testing its Covid-19 vaccine on a larger cohort of thousands of children under 12 years old in the US, Finland, Poland and Spain after selecting a lower dose of the shot in an earlier stage of the trial. A top White House official has urged state governors to work with the US Food and Drug Administration to extend the shelf life of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s Covid vaccine as millions of unused doses nationwide near expiration. Many thousands of vaccine doses have been destroyed in African countries after exceeding their expiry dates amid a reluctance to be inoculated and a lack of medical infrastructure, while some jabs were donated relatively late in their shelf life. Music fans flocked to the first unrestricted European festival since the pandemic began over the weekend at an event in Albania that had 10,000 attendees across four days, with everyone showing proof of a recent negative test. Washington state is to give adults a free cannabis spliff after they receive a Covid jab in an attempt to accelerate vaccination uptake through a promotion coined “Joints for Jabs” by the state’s liquor and cannabis board. Vaccine passports will be used for the first time at UK sporting events for England’s Euro 2020 group games at Wembley stadium. However, those not fully vaccinated can show proof of a negative lateral flow test taken within the previous 48 hours, the BBC reports. Uefa, the European football governing body, said UK-based ticket holders aged 11 or over must present evidence of full vaccination, with both doses received at least 14 days before each match. Vaccination status can be displayed through the NHS app. But attendees of matches at Hampden Park will not be required to show proof of vaccination or a negative Covid-19 test. Wembley will host up to of 22,500 people, 25% of its capacity, for England’s group D fixtures against Scotland, Czech Republic, and Croatia. England play the latter on Sunday. A former Slovenian figure skater who competed in the 1992 Winter Olympics has been criminally charged in Manhattan, US, with fraudulently raising $1.6 million meant to help small American businesses cope with the pandemic. Reuters has the story: US prosecutors charged Luka Klasinc, 48, with bank fraud and aggravated identity theft related to his alleged use of falsified documents. The fraud count carries a maximum 30-year prison term. Prosecutors said Klasinc owns BOB77 LLC, which has staged ice-themed amusement park events in locations such as Warsaw, Poland; Dusseldorf, Germany; and Ljubljana, Slovenia. According to court papers, BOB77 received $1.6 million of US small Business Administration (SBA) “economic injury disaster loans” from July to September 2020, when there were also many wire transfers to international recipients from its accounts. After Klasinc’s bank froze the accounts on suspicion of fraud, Klasinc allegedly provided a falsified letter on SBA letterhead to “verify” the funds’ legitimacy. Klasinc flew in from Istanbul on 31 May and visited the bank three times to access the funds but was denied, and the bank alerted law enforcement, prosecutors said. World Bank president David Malpass has said the institution does not support waiving intellectual property rights for Covid-19 vaccines at the World Trade Organization out of concern that it would hamper innovation in the pharmaceuticals sector. As WTO negotiations over the proposed waiver resumed in Geneva, Malpass was asked whether he supports a potential vaccine IP waiver, which India, South Africa and other emerging market countries argue is needed to expand vaccine access He said: “We don’t support that, for the reason that it would run the risk of reducing the innovation and the R&amp;D in that sector.” The comment puts Malpass, a Trump administration nominee, at odds with the Biden administration, which is supporting text-based WTO negotiations for vaccine intellectual property rights, led by US trade representative Katherine Tai. Major vaccine makers and the pharmaceutical industries have opposed the waiver. However, Malpass reiterated his calls for wealthy countries to quickly donate their excess vaccine doses to the developing world as quickly as possible. Three of the leading Covid vaccine manufacturers have paid out $26bn in dividends and stock buyouts to shareholders in the last year – enough to cover the cost of vaccinating the population of Africa, say campaigners. Conservative backbencher Steve Baker has urged the UK government to press ahead with lifting England’s remaining Covid restrictions on 21 June despite a sharp rise in cases. He claimed that by that date, all over-50s and vulnerable younger adults should have been given the opportunity to receive two doses of Covid vaccine. These groups represent about 99% of Covid deaths and about 80% of hospitalisations. As of today, according to announcements made by the government, these groups should all have been offered a chance to have had a second dose. It would be helpful for the government to clarify that this has been achieved. If this brilliant milestone isn’t enough to convince ministers that we need to lift all remaining restrictions – especially social distancing requirements – on 21 June, nothing will ever get us out of this. The Dutch government has promised an independent investigation into a supposedly not-for-profit €100m deal to buy facemasks from China last year that ended up making three young entrepreneurs about €20m richer. The investigative website Follow the Money revealed that Sywert van Lienden, 30, a former civil servant turned TV pundit and activist, who co-wrote the manifesto of the Christian Democrat (CDA) party (part of the ruling coalition), netted €9.2m. His two associates, Bernd Damme, and Camille van Gestel, made €5.7m and €5.5m respectively, after launching a not-for-profit foundation amid a barrage of publicity in April 2020, after hospitals and officials warned of a desperate shortage of PPE. A top White House official has urged state governors to work with the US Food and Drug Administration to extend the shelf life of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s Covid vaccine as millions of unused doses nationwide near expiration. “I would encourage every governor who has doses that they worry may be expiring to work with the FDA directly on the proper storage procedures as they continue to examine processes that will allow them to potentially last longer,” White House Covid-19 Advisor Andy Slavitt said on a press call today. AP reports that Slavitt added that the FDA is working on plans to safely store the unused J&amp;J vaccines. The pharmaceutical giant has said it is conducting ongoing stability assessment studies that could allow it to extend the expiration dates for its one-shot vaccine. Safety concerns about J&amp;J’s shot and flagging demand for vaccinations have left close to half of the 21 million doses the company has produced for the US sitting unused. Demand for all the vaccines has slowed since mid-April, but the drop has been significantly steeper for the J&amp;J shot. Reuters reported that at least 13 lots of J&amp;J shots have expiration dates of 27 June or earlier. It is not clear how many doses that reflects. J&amp;J has another 100 million doses on hand but shipment timing is uncertain. Starbucks has said it will start accepting reusable cups from customers in the US later this month, more than a year after stopping their use due to the pandemic. Reuters reports that coffee chains had been encouraging the use of reusable cups and thermos flasks to lower their high carbon footprint before the health crisis caused them to shift to disposables last year. The rollout of Covid-19 vaccines in the US has, however, allowed restaurants to restart dining rooms and apparel sellers such as Kohl’s Corp and Target Corp to reopen their fitting rooms. Starbucks said it would also adopt a contactless method that would eliminate any shared touchpoints between its baristas and customers bringing their personal cups. Last week, the coffee chain announced it would offer reusable cups in stores across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa by 2025. The confirmed number of Covid-19 patients in intensive care in Northern Ireland has dropped to zero. PA has the story: Deputy first minister Michelle O’Neill said it is the first time the number has been zero in ten months. O’Neill expressed her thanks to healthcare workers and also encouraged the public to continue playing their part. “For the first time in 10 months in the North, there are zero Covid patients in intensive care,” O’Neill tweeted. “A massive thank you to our healthcare workers for their efforts - let’s keep playing our part and making progress.” Today, there were 15 confirmed Covid-positive patients in the region’s hospitals. None were described in Department of Health data as being confirmed in ICU beds. No further deaths of patients who had previously tested positive for the virus were notified on Tuesday, however another 81 cases were confirmed. AP has this dispatch from the White House briefing room yesterday, where for the first time in 449 days reporters crammed into every seat for the daily briefing. Coronavirus restrictions had kept one of the most recognised rooms in the US government almost empty. But mass vaccinations allowed reporters to first doff their masks on 13 May and then nearly a month later to gather in a pack of raised hands, shouting, hard-eyed stares and the occasional grimace. “Hope everyone’s cozy,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said at she stepped to the lectern. Forty-nine journalists sat elbow-to-elbow in blue seats, while others stood on the edges. The loudspeaker before the briefing told reporters not to block the aisle, but no one budged. The questions covered a wide range — a sign that there are still plenty of tensions, emergencies and unknowns to consume any administration’s time. The topics included Russia, China, Afghanistan, cyberattacks, infrastructure, voting rights, vaccinations and Supreme Court decisions. Presidents might campaign on policies and promises, but most administrations must deal with a daily degree of chaos, sometimes of their own making. National security adviser Jake Sullivan also took the podium at Monday’s briefing to preview the president’s first foreign trip, which will begin this week with a G7 summit meeting in the UK. South Africa’s president Cyril Ramaphosa has placed the country’s health minister on “special leave” over alleged links to a corruption scandal involving coronavirus communications funding. Graft investigators opened a probe into two of Zweli Mkhize’s close aides last month. The pair, Mkhize’s former spokeswoman and ex-personal assistant, are accused of pocketing public funds set aside to fund South Africa’s coronavirus response plan. AFP reports that around 90 million rand ($6.6 million) were allegedly syphoned off using a front company, Digital Vibes, awarded a 150 million rand tender in March 2020 to handle the health ministry’s communications campaign. Ramaphosa has “placed minister of health Dr Zweli Mkhize on special leave,” the presidency said in a statement. It said the leave period “will enable the minister to attend to allegations and investigations concerning contracts” between his department and Digital Vibes. Revelations about the alleged mishandling of coronavirus funds surfaced last year and have led investigators to believe that billions of rands have fallen into the hands of politically connected companies, sparking public outrage. Mkhize has previously denied any involvement with Digital Vibes, claiming he had no knowledge of the company or the tender process. He wrote to the ruling African National Congress party last week to request a meeting of its integrity committee to state his case. Ministers are said to be considering delaying the easing of lockdown in England on 21 June for somewhere between two weeks and a month. My colleague Nicola Davis looks at what a delay could mean, and how long it may need to last. In the UK, 6,048 positive coronavirus cases have been confirmed on Tuesday, and 13 further deaths within 28 days of a positive test, according to official data. That brings the UK total deaths to 127,854. Separate figures published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show there have been 153,000 deaths registered in the UK where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate. The number of people who have received the first dose of a vaccine rose to 40,573,517, a rise of 112,941 on the previous day. 28,227,362 were recorded as second doses, an increase of 306,068. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) will give a verdict on the use of Moderna Covid-19 vaccine in 12- to 17-year-olds next month, following an application by the drugmaker. The committee said it would “speed up” assessment of data submitted adding that a delay would happen if the EMA required any additional information. It’s worth bearing in mind the two-dose vaccine is already being used in the EU, the US, and Canada for people over 18 years of age. The company has also sought approval in Canada for use in adolescents and plans for a US application. If approved, the Moderna vaccine would become the second shot to be allowed for use in teenagers in the EU after Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine was approved last month. In England, measures to try to halt the rise of the Delta variant of will cover 10% of England’s population. Health secretary Matt Hancock has announced a “strengthened package of support” to be provided for Greater Manchester and Lancashire, where case numbers remain high. Other areas, such as Bolton, will continue to receive support. Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham stressed this was “not a lockdown” but “advice”. At a press conference he said: “Obviously what we’re seeing here is a localised approach to messaging, more localised support on testing and on tracing and isolation. We are also saying that also should apply to vaccination. “We are not asking for any more vaccine here than our fair share, what we are asking for is the bringing forward of Greater Manchester’s supplies, so that we can run a surge vaccination programme over the next three weeks.” On Monday, Hancock told the House of Commons that out of 12,383 cases of the Delta variant, 464 people went on to seek emergency care and 126 were admitted to hospital. Of these, 83 people were unvaccinated, 28 had one dose of vaccine and just three had had both doses. Pfizer will begin testing its Covid-19 vaccine on a larger cohort of children under 12 years old after selecting a lower dose of the shot in an earlier stage of the trial. The study will enrol up to 4,500 children at more than 90 clinical sites in the US, Finland, Poland, and Spain, the company said. Based on safety, tolerability and the immune response generated by 144 children in a phase I study of the two-dose shot, Pfizer said it will test a dose of 10 micrograms in children between five and 11 years of age. They will also test 3 micrograms for the age group of six months to five years old. The vaccine has been authorised for use in children as young as 12 in Europe, the US and Canada. They receive the same dose as adults: 30 micrograms. Inoculating children and young people is considered a critical step toward reaching “herd immunity” and taming the Covid-19 pandemic. Nearly 7 million teens have received at least one dose of the vaccine in the US, according to the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. The husband and wife team who helped make the first Covid-19 vaccine are contributing to a book about their efforts. BioNTech founders Ugur Sahin and Özlem Türeci, from Germany, are collaborating with Joe Miller of the Financial Times on The Vaccine. Publication of the book is scheduled for 2 November. According to the publishing group St Martin’s, the book will detail how the pair were able to develop a panel of vaccine candidates within a matter of weeks, how they convinced major pharmaceutical companies to support their work, and how in partnership with Pfizer they managed to produce more than 2bn doses for countries around the world. Meanwhile, the Pfizer chairman and CEO, Albert Bourla, is also working on a book, announced last month. Harper Business is publishing Bourla’s Moonshot: Inside Pfizer’s Nine-Month Race to Make the Impossible Possible on 9 November. You can read more about Ugur Sahin and Özlem Türeci here: A dope idea? Washington state is to give adults a free cannabis spliff after they receive a Covid jab in an attempt to accelerate vaccination uptake. The promotion, coined “Joints for Jabs” by the state’s liquor and cannabis board, was announced yesterday and will run until 12 July. Participating cannabis retailers will give the pre-rolled spliffs to those who have received their first or second dose, if they wish to get high. According to the New York Times, 58% of people in Washington have received at least one dose and 49% are fully vaccinated. The state also recently instituted plans to allow a free beer, wine or cocktail to residents with proof of vaccination, the Washington Post reports. Elsewhere in the US, the paper reports that after the pace of vaccinations began to seriously decline in April, states and cities began promotions including a raffle for full college scholarships and lotteries including prizes of $1m of more – with only those who had been vaccinated eligible. Plans to allow an NHS system to extract patient data from doctors’ surgeries in England have been delayed amid concerns around privacy. But Jo Churchill, the public health minister, said the data programme would still go ahead this year. The World Bank has raised its global growth forecast to 5.6% for 2021, marking the strongest recovery from a recession in 80 years due to US stimulus spending and faster growth in China but held back by “highly unequal” access to Covid-19 vaccines. Reuters has the story: The development lender’s latest Global Economic Prospects report showed a 1.5% point increase from forecasts made in January, before the Biden administration took office and enacted a $1.9 trillion US Covid-19 aid package. Since then, vaccines have become much more widely distributed in the US and some other wealthy countries, boosting their output, as forecasts lag for emerging market and low-income countries. “This recovery is uneven and largely reflects sharp rebounds in some major economies - most notably the US, owing to substantial fiscal support - amid highly unequal vaccine access,” the World Bank said in the report. Many emerging market and developing economies were seeing elevated Covid-19 caseloads, obstacles to vaccination and withdrawal of support, the bank said. By 2022, this will leave global output about 2% below pre-pandemic projections, and about two thirds of emerging market economies will still not have made up last year’s per-capita income losses. If vaccine distribution to developing countries can be accelerated, World Bank economist Ayhan Kose said that 2022 global GDP growth, currently forecast at 4.3%, could increase substantially to around 5%. A small addendum on the final paragraph: one wonders to what extent the profits from an acceleration of vaccine distribution to developing countries would further entrench the north-south global divide. Many thousands of vaccine doses have been destroyed in African countries after exceeding their expiry dates amid a reluctance to be inoculated and a lack of medical infrastructure, the BBC reports. Malawi has destroyed almost 20,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, while South Sudan said it would safely dispose of 59,000 doses and hand back another 72,000 to the global Covax scheme for poorer countries. The Democratic Republic of Congo said it could not use most of the 1.7 million AstraZeneca doses it received through Covax, so they were sent to Ghana, Madagascar and elsewhere. Nigeria was also unable to use some doses. Some vaccines are given with a short shelf life before expiry, such as a batch of one million doses South Africa received from India in February with an expiry date of 13 April. However, the the country’s government opted not to use them due to concerns the jabs did not offer sufficient protection from the prevalent Covid variant. Malawi virologist Gama Bandawe told the BBC that mistrust of vaccines has played a role in the country being unable to use all the supplies it has received. A study commissioned by the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention on Covid-19 vaccine perceptions in 15 countries suggests that a significant proportion of people on the continent harbour concerns around vaccine safety. Unions representing teachers and other school staff are calling on the government to reinstate masks in classrooms in England in response to a growing number of Covid outbreaks, particularly among secondary pupils. Authorities in 92 countries shut down 113,000 websites and online marketplaces selling counterfeit or illicit medicines and medical products last month, including vast quantities of fake Covid-19 tests and face masks, Interpol has said. “As the pandemic forced more people to move their lives online, criminals were quick to target these new ‘customers’,” Jurgen Stock, secretary general of the international police agency, said in a statement. AFP reports that unauthorised Covid testing kits accounted for over half of all the medical devices seized from 18-25 May, the agency said, while Italian authorities found more than 500,000 fake surgical masks and 35 machines for their production and packaging. Police arrested 227 people worldwide and recovered pharmaceutical products worth $23m. “Whilst some individuals were knowingly buying illicit medicines, many thousands of victims were unwittingly putting their health and potentially their lives at risk,” Stock said. Fake and illicit drugs were also found concealed in shipments of clothes, jewellery, toys and food. The roughly 9m devices and drugs seized was the highest number since Interpol began coordinating the fake medicine campaigns, known as Pangea operations, in 2008. Researchers in Denmark are using virtual reality to encourage more Covid-19 vaccinations, through a game of manoeuvring through a virus-infected crowd in a city square. In an experiment by the University of Copenhagen, participants wear goggles to play an elderly person crossing the square while avoiding red-clothed by-passers infected with Covid-19. Vaccinated characters dress in blue. “It was fun, definitely. It felt like you were there,” said Adam, a participant who got infected in the game he played in a Copenhagen park. “We know from similar studies that after people went through a virtual reality experience like this, their vaccination intention increases. We have observed this with Covid already,” said Robert Bohm, professor of psychology at the University of Copenhagen, citing a prior online study by the researchers. The World Health Organization estimates that immunisation prevents 4 million to 5 million deaths every year. In February-March, more than a quarter of European Union adults said they would refuse a Covid-19 shot, a survey by the EU agency Eurofound showed. Music fans flocked to the first unrestricted European festival since the pandemic began over the weekend at an event in Albania that had 10,000 attendees across four days. The open-air Unum music festival saw performances by 50 international and local musicians, as people embraced the chance to hear nonstop music for five days at Thrown Sand beach, 75km north-west of the capital, Tirana. AP reports that organisers claimed that everyone at the festival was free of Covid-19. “Once everyone is tested, It’ll be safer among thousands of people inside the festival than it will be outside in the general population,” Grego O’Halloran, the head organiser, told Mixmag ahead of the event. “We went to the Albanian government and said that we have a way of testing people and they were like ‘Alright great, well that sounds good!’ “There will be testing stations all around the city that you can pop in to, or if you’ve got a negative PCR test arriving into Albania that will cover you for a certain period. There’ll be a double check mid-festival to make sure everything is as secure as possible.” The main stage near the beach was on top of a sailboat, while another was under the pine trees close to the beach. Festivalgoers came from all across Europe, even as far away as Uruguay. “[It’s] awesome … crazy … insane to see so many people in one place … [after] sitting in one room in your apartment alone in lockdown,” said one German attendee. The event was possible because of Albania’s low contagion rate. It recorded only two new infections on Saturday. The foreign ministry noted there were no pandemic restrictions for anyone wanting to come to Albania. The motto of the festival was for people to become “one” and unite over music, and some said music was more important than most people realised. “It was necessary for our mental health,” said Ron Kurtolli, a DJ from Kosovo. “People don’t pay much attention to mental health, but it’s really important for the well-being of everything.” Thousands of US families with children in foster care have seen reunifications snarled as courts delayed cases, went virtual or temporarily shut down, according to an Associated Press analysis of child welfare data from 34 states. The decrease in children leaving foster care means families are lingering longer in a system intended to be temporary, as critical services were shuttered or limited. Vulnerable families are suffering long-term and perhaps irreversible damage, experts say, which could leave parents with weakened bonds with their children. The AP’s analysis found at least 8,700 fewer reunifications during the early months of the pandemic compared with the March-to-December period the year before – a decrease of 16%. Adoptions dropped too — by 23%. Overall, at least 22,600 fewer children left foster care compared with 2019. “The systemic problems around racism and poverty in Covid and how people are treated in the child welfare system may be compounding,” said Sharon Vandivere of the group Child Trends, who noted that longer stays in foster care are inherently traumatic and make reunifications less likely. Many more men in India have received Covid-19 vaccines than women, government data shows, highlighting gender disparity in the country’s immunisation drive that has also disadvantaged the rural population. Reuters reports that India has partly or fully vaccinated about 101 million men, nearly 17% more than women. Men account for 54% of the total number of people inoculated, according to the data. Many federally administered regions, the capital Delhi, and big states such as Uttar Pradesh have seen some of the worst inequities. Only Kerala in the south and Chhattisgarh in central India have vaccinated more women than men. “We are noticing that men, especially in towns and villages, prefer to take the vaccine before women as they have to travel for work, while women are relegated to domestic chores,” said Prashant Pandya, medical superintendent at a big government hospital in the western state of Gujarat. India, with a population of 1.3 billion, has about 6% more men than women. Fifteen of the UK’s Nobel prize-winning scientists, economists and peace activists have called on the country to “play a historic role” in removing “artificial” intellectual property barriers that are “restricting” Covid-19 vaccine production. In a letter to the UK prime minister, the Nobel laureates caution that “last year, science was the main barrier to beating this disease; but today, it is inequality”, with highly effective vaccines largely available only to wealthy countries. An intellectual property waiver is “an essential step to increase production”, the letter said, calling for pharmaceutical giants to be forced to share their vaccine technology and know-how through the World Health Organisation’s Covid-19 Technology Access Pool. India and South Africa first proposed a Covid vaccine waiver at the World Trade Organisation eight months ago, with the support of more than 100 mostly low and middle-income countries, but the move was blocked by a small number of rich countries including the US, Japan, the UK, and EU. Sir Richard Roberts, awarded the 1993 Nobel Prize in medicine, said: The scientific case for this is clear. If we allow Covid-19 to spread around the globe for years, not only will millions needlessly die, but the virus will continue to mutate into more virulent strains. That could undo all of our work – including the work of British scientists – in developing effective vaccines and will likely prolong the pandemic for years. We don’t have time for politicking. The intellectual property barriers to vaccine production are hindering local production of vaccines, especially in low and middle income countries, and they must be cleared away. Sir Christopher Pissarides, awarded the 2010 Nobel prize in economic sciences, said: British scientists have created life-saving vaccines that can help save the lives of millions. But it would be a tragedy if in these exceptional times they are locked away and kept secret, shared among only a handful of pharmaceutical companies. Mairead Corrigan-Maguire, awarded the 1976 Nobel peace prize, said: With high vaccination rates in rich countries while low and middle-income nations suffer, we are watching a system of vaccine apartheid develop. There is no justification for the needless loss of life in the months since India and South Africa first requested an intellectual property waiver. These are global public goods, developed largely with public funding; they belong to all of us. Boris Johnson must do what is right and support this waiver, for all of humanity. A host of celebrities including David Beckham, Olivia Colman and Billie Eilish have written to world leaders calling for surplus coronavirus vaccines to be shared with poorer countries. In an open letter, published ahead of the G7 summit on Friday, the Unicef ambassadors said the meeting was a “vital opportunity” for action to be taken. The world has spent a year and a half battling the Covid-19 pandemic, but the virus is still spreading in many countries and producing new variants with the potential to put us all back where we started. This means more school closures, more healthcare disruptions and greater economic fallout - threatening the futures of families and children everywhere. The pandemic will not be over anywhere until it is over everywhere, and that means getting vaccines to every country, as quickly and equitably as possible. This weekend’s G7 summit is a vital opportunity for you to agree the actions that will get vaccines where they are most needed, fast. Other signatories include actors Liam Neeson, Orlando Bloom, Gemma Chan, and Whoopi Goldberg, singers Katy Perry and P!nk, and UK tennis ace Andy Murray. The letter also warned that Covax, the global initiative supporting poorer countries in gaining access to vaccines, is facing a shortfall of 190 million doses. Unicef has proposed that G7 countries should donate 20% of their vaccines between June and August to help address the shortages temporarily. “As a Unicef goodwill ambassador I believe in the crucial benefit of vaccinations,” said former England footballer Beckham. “The pandemic won’t be over until it’s over everywhere, so it’s vital that all communities around the world have fair access to Covid-19 vaccines urgently.” More than 1 million Europeans have received the new EU Covid health certificate being rolled out to unlock travel within the bloc, the European Commission has said. AFP reports: EU justice commissioner Didier Reynders announced the figure to the European parliament ahead of a vote to enshrine the document in law in time for the continent’s summer tourism season. The certificate – showing the bearer’s immunity to Covid-19 either through vaccination or previous infection, or their negative test status – is to be used for intra-EU travel from 1 July. But the commission wants as many EU countries as possible to start earlier. “The more certificates we can already issue, the easier the process will be during the summer - otherwise, we risk a big bang on the first of July, which we cannot afford,” Reynders said. As of today, nine EU countries were already issuing the documents, with more than a million citizens have received such certificates – which can be presented either online or on paper – already. EU lawmakers and capitals also agreed that, when it comes to proof of vaccinations, only the jabs authorised by the European Medicines Agency – so far those from BioNTech/Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson – would be accepted in all EU countries. But individual countries can also decide to accept, for their territory only, others, such as one produced by China, or Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine. To prevent discrimination against the unvaccinated - particularly younger Europeans who have not yet been able to access jabs given in priority to the elderly - much emphasis has also been put on testing. The parliament failed to make Covid tests for travel free of charge, but extracted money and concessions from the European Commission to make them more affordable. As we emerge from a widespread internet outage, a top Japanese virologist and government adviser has said there is a risk of spreading Covid-19 during the Tokyo Olympics. Tohoku University professor Hitoshi Oshitani was an architect of Japan’s “Three Cs” approach to the pandemic, which advises avoiding closed spaces, crowds and close contact situations. He told the Times: The government and the organising committee, including the IOC (International Olympic Committee), keep saying they’re holding a safe Olympics. But everybody knows there is a risk. It’s 100% impossible to have an Olympics with zero risk … of the spread of infection in Japan and also in other countries after the Olympics. There are a number of countries that do not have many cases, and a number that don’t have any variants. We should not make the Olympics [an occasion] to spread the virus to these countries. Already postponed from last year because of the pandemic, a scaled-down version of the Games with no foreign spectators is set to start on 23 July despite public fears the event could spread the coronavirus and drain medical resources. However, a former Olympian turned public health expert, said she believed the Games can be pulled off with an acceptable level of risk. “There will be cases, but having one case or a couple of cases doesn’t mean that it was a failure,” Tara Kirk Sell, a professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told Reuters. Sell, a silver medallist swimmer at the 2004 Games, added: “These Games are very much a symbol of the whole world emerging from this terrible, global pandemic … If we wanted to be as safe as possible, we’d never leave our house.” Amid the outage, my colleague Martin Belam handed over the blog, so it will be me Mattha Busby bringing you global coronavirus updates for the next couple of hours. You may contact me via email on mattha.busby.freelance@guardian.co.uk or on Twitter. Please do get in touch with any tips or thoughts. China has approved the emergency use of a Covid-19 vaccine for those as young as three, according to a spokesperson for Sinovac. That would make it the first country to offer jabs to young children. Britain ignored scientific advice and instead took a political decision when it failed to put Malta on its list of safe travel destinations, Malta foreign minister Evarist Bartolo said. Visitors to Portugal must now quarantine for 10 days on return to England, as the county’s move to the “red list” came into effect. Vietnam has started asking for public donations to buy vaccines as it struggles to contain a new coronavirus wave. Unicef has urged rich members of the G7 to start donating vaccines to poor countries now, instead of waiting to donate leftovers all at once, saying many nations don’t have capacity to roll out huge amounts in one go. India’s government will provide free vaccinations for all adults, Prime Minister Narendra Modi says, as the capital New Delhi and financial hub Mumbai ease lockdowns on falling infection levels. The state of Uttar Pradesh in India has announced that it will end some Covid restrictions. The weekday daytime curfew would be lifted in all 75 districts of the state, as all of them have fallen below 600 active Covid cases. The president of the Tokyo 2020 organizsing committee, Seiko Hashimoto, has announced that there will be restrictions on the movement media using GPS tracking during the Games. New Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Tuesday that she would get her first Covid-19 shot at the end of next week. Canada is preparing to ease birder restrictions for vaccinated travellers, Bloomberg reports. The Czech Republic has announced it will reopen its borders to EU and Serbian citizens on June 21. Spain’s football squad will be get a Covid-19 vaccine shot, less than a week before their opening Euro 2020 match, after captain Sergio Busquets tested positive. Health officials in New South Wales, Australia, have had to reiterate advice over Covid-19 after a number of businesses in Byron Shire were witnessed asking vaccinated customers not to enter their premises under the misapprehension they could shed the virus. Vietnam, once a model for its successful handling of the pandemic, has started asking for public donations to buy vaccines as it struggles to contain a new coronavirus wave. AFP reports that the south-east Asian country has vaccinated only about 1% of its population of nearly 100 million, and authorities have become increasingly alarmed by a recent spike in cases. Since last week, mobile phone users have received up to three text messages urging them to contribute to a Covid-19 vaccine fund, while civil servants have been encouraged to part with a day’s pay. Some residents, fearful of the virus’ impact on Vietnam’s economy – one of the few in the world to expand last year – told AFP they support the fundraising drive. Nguyen Tuan Anh, a civil servant, told AFP he had sent about $50 via bank transfer and SMS payment, as vaccines would mean “Vietnam’s economy will be stable and develop again”. Vietnam’s industrial northern provinces – home to key factories such as Samsung and Foxconn – have been particularly badly hit by the latest outbreak. Across the country, tens of thousands of people have lost their jobs, according to state media, with bars and restaurants forced to close in major hubs such as Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City and public gatherings cancelled. Cases have more than tripled since April to reach almost 9,000. Although the number is low in comparison to most of its south-east Asian neighbours, Vietnam’s vaccination rate per capita is the lowest in the region, and among the lowest in Asia, according to an AFP tally. The Spanish football squad’s players will be get a Covid-19 vaccine shot tomorrow, less than a week before their opening Euro 2020 match, after captain Sergio Busquets tested positive, Sports Minister Jose Manuel Rodriguez Uribes said. Busquets’ positive has thrown Spain’s tournament preparations into chaos with the remaining 23 players going into isolation along with the coaching staff. An Under-21 side led by their coach Luis de la Fuente will face Lithuania tonight in what was supposed to be the nation’s final warm-up game before the Euros. Coach Luis Enrique called up a group of six players, including Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga, to complement the squad. They will train separately in “parallel bubble” away from the main Euros squad with a view to them being added should the need occur. Reuters report that so far, all the other players and staff have tested negative. “We are making an exception because they represent us in a top level competition,” Rodriguez Uribes told Cadena Ser radio station, adding that they were already planning to give them the shots before Spain’s captain had tested positive. Health officials in New South Wales, Australia, have had to reiterate advice over Covid-19 after a number of businesses in Byron Shire were witnessed asking vaccinated customers not to enter their premises under the misapprehension they could shed the virus. The New South Wales department of health has stressed that it is impossible for people to develop, shed, or spread the virus through receiving a vaccine. The advice comes after some businesses in the small town of Mullumbimby placed signs in their windows that read: ‘If you have had the Covid-19 vaccine we ask you not to enter for two weeks or longer until any symptoms subside’. One of the signs falsely states that the spread of the virus following vaccination was emerging from “first hand accounts” and that vaccinated people were “inadvertently harming” the health of others. The town is located in the Northern Rivers region of New South Wales and is about 15km inland from Byron Bay. It is a region with a high level of vaccine hesitancy and refusal, with childhood vaccination rates among the lowest in Australia. A former paramedic who runs a World Health Organisation [WHO] approved vaccination information website, Heidi Robertson, said she was appalled to see the signs as she walked down Stuart Street on Monday. She and health professionals living in the region, including intensive care specialist Dr Rachael Heap, have been working hard for several years to educate the community about vaccination. “We wanted to change the narrative around the region, because we’ve got such a shocking rate of vaccination uptake and we are known for that in Mullumbimby,” Robertson said. Read more of Melissa Davey’s report here: ‘Vaccine won’t give you Covid’: health officials battle anti-vaccination messages in Northern Rivers Andrew Sparrow’s UK live blog is up and running for the day if it is UK developments that you are after. I’ll keep my focus on international Covid news here. A total of 95 deaths registered in England and Wales in the week ending 28 May mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) - the lowest number since the week ending 4 September 2020. PA note that the figure is down 11% on the previous week. It is the first time the number of deaths has been below 100 since the week ending 11 September. Around one in 100 deaths registered in the week to 28 May mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate. China has approved the emergency use of a Covid-19 vaccine for those as young as three, according to a spokesperson for Sinovac who spoke to AFP. That would make it the first country to offer jabs to young children. “In recent days, the Sinovac vaccine was approved for emergency use in three- to 17-year-olds,” the spokesperson said. But they did not confirm when the young children would be able to start receiving the shots, saying the schedule for the rollout will be decided by the National Health Commission “according to China’s current epidemic prevention and control needs and vaccine supply”. The company has completed early phase trials of the vaccine in children and adolescents, with results to be published shortly in the Lancet scientific journal, the spokesperson added. State broadcaster CCTV reported over the weekend that an unnamed official in the State Council’s epidemic response task force had said vaccines had been approved for children, and “the safety and effectiveness” had been proven. A spokesperson for China’s other major vaccine, Sinopharm, said that experts had demonstrated the effectiveness of its vaccine in children, but didn’t confirm whether it had been approved for use. A quick one from Reuters: Russia reported 9,977 new Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, including 3,817 in Moscow. The government coronavirus task force also said that 379 people had died of coronavirus-related causes in the last 24 hours, pushing the official death toll to 124,496. That’s far fewer than the 270,000 that the state statistics service says had died from Covid-19 and related causes from April 2020 to April 2021. Britain ignored scientific advice and instead took a political decision when it failed to put Malta on its list of safe travel destinations, Malta Foreign Minister Evarist Bartolo said. Britons traditionally account for a third of all arrivals on the small Mediterranean island, and opposition politicians criticised the government for failing to convince London that Malta was a safe tourist destination. Britain last week revised its so-called “green list” of countries, that do not require quarantine on return, choosing not to put any new country on it, while removing Portugal. But Bartolo said the British government did not want its nationals to go abroad because of concerns over growing coronavirus cases at home. “The British government is ignoring scientific advice. It has taken a political decision not to allow travel anywhere, despite the pressure it faces from airlines, tourism operators and the people in general,” he wrote on Facebook. Chris Scicluna reports from Valetta for Reuters that Malta on Monday reported no new Covid-19 cases for the first time in 11 months. Half of its adult population has been fully vaccinated and 75% have received a first dose of a vaccine - the highest rate within the European Union. Dr Nikki Kanani, director of primary care at NHS England, said that vaccine confidence in younger people had increased in the UK. Speaking as over-25s were invited to book their Covid-19 jabs, PA report Dr Kanani told BBC Breakfast: “We’re still seeing great uptake and we are definitely seeing younger people coming in and asking more questions, which is absolutely fine. “More than four in five 40 to 49-year-olds have had their first dose and two-thirds of 30 to 39-year-olds have already had theirs, and that is still going to increase, of course, as people come forward, so uptake remains high. “We had additional polling over the weekend that shows that the confidence in the vaccine has increased by a fifth - by 20% - in those under-40s. “What’s really important as we go into the younger categories is really appealing to people in their own communities and what our teams have done so well is reflect what a community needs locally - whether that’s setting up pop-up vaccination centres in Gurudwaras or temples, or in shopping malls or at workplaces, that has been critical to making sure that people feel confident to take up the vaccine when they’re asked to do so.” Overnight saw a rush to travel back to the UK from Portugal, as travellers had until 4am to return to avoid having to quarantine for 10 days after the country was moved from the “green” list to the “amber” list, without being placed on a watchlist first. The UK’s environment minister has been getting a tough ride on the media morning round in the UK – being asked whether the travel rules, and government advice, have to be this complicated, and why there was so little warning of the change of status. Eustace said “Our advice has always been that you should not travel to countries on the amber list.” The Gaby Hinsliff column today asks the question before Britain vaccinates children, should it vaccinate the world? She writes: Personally I was thrilled to get my vaccine and would be more than happy for my son to have it, but what brought me up short was the question I saw posed recently by the epidemiologist Adam Kucharski: if rich countries have enough vaccine left to jab children at incredibly low risk of serious illness and death, why aren’t they offering it to poorer countries where people are dying for lack of it? Shouldn’t we be taking more seriously the threat not just of humanitarian crises, but of a more resistant variant emerging in some place where the virus is currently raging out of control, fatally undermining the vaccines that remain our only real route to freedom? Only 2% of sub-Saharan Africa has had a first dose. Thailand, engulfed by a severe outbreak, is only just beginning mass vaccinations. Even if the G7 summit agrees this week to invest billions in ramping up vaccine production for poorer countries – as a group of former world leaders led by Gordon Brown wants – that takes months to come on stream. If Britain doesn’t want to seal its borders – and nothing in ministers’ confused approach to foreign holidays suggests they do – then digging an ever-stronger domestic firebreak against the more contagious Delta variant we have just imported from India won’t be enough. We’re going to need a global firebreak against something worse evolving too, and fast. Read more here: Gaby Hinsliff – Before Britain vaccinates children, should it vaccinate the world? Helen Davidson reports from Taipei: Some tentative good news from Taiwan, with a second consecutive day of cases in the 200s and no new cases from backlogged test results. As long as results are not down because of lower weekend testing, the decline is a positive sign in Taiwan’s battle against its worst outbreak of the pandemic. However with about 8,000 cases still active, fatalities have not stopped and authorities reported another 22 deaths. The new cases were mostly in New Taipei city, with 123 recorded. Another 54 were reported from the capital Taipei, while 16 were found in Miaoli where there are growing concerns over an outbreak among employees from three factories which has so far infected 211 people. Health and welfare minister, Chen Chih-shung, said the rate of positive cases in New Taipei was dropping but there was no room yet to relax current restrictions. He urged people not to travel during an upcoming long weekend and dragon-boat festival, which authorities have not cancelled. Vaccine supplies took another hit, with authorities saying expected shipments of AstraZeneca and from Covax had been delayed by about a month. Half of the 150,000 recently obtained Moderna vaccines have been allocated to frontline medical staff. China’s vaccination numbers are never low. Official figures reported by Reuters say that the nation administered about 16.3 million doses of vaccine on 7 June, bringing the total number administered to 794m. In India, the state of Uttar Pradesh has announced that it will end some Covid restrictions. The Hindustan Times reports this morning: The Uttar Pradesh government on Tuesday gave relaxations in ‘corona curfew’ in all 75 districts of the state. According to guidelines announced by the state government, districts with less than 600 active cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) can get relaxations. A state government spokesperson said that there will be relaxation in coronavirus curfew in all the districts of the state from Wednesday onwards, from 7am to 7pm, for five days. However, the night curfew – 7pm to 7am and weekend curfew (for entire day) – will continue. The UK’s environment secretary George Eustace – a man who clearly isn’t in the position where he hasn’t seen family and loved ones abroad for over a year due to travel bans – has told Sky News this morning: “I have no intention of travelling or going on a holiday abroad this summer.” He was being pressed by newly returned presenter Kay Burley on the scramble for flights back from Portugal after it was moved from the “green list” to the “amber list” with very little warning. PA Media quotes him saying: Our advice has been don’t travel unless it’s absolutely necessary. Obviously we had hoped, with these three categories that we had, we had hoped that situation would be improving in other parts of the world, that we’d be able to progressively add other countries to the green list. Sadly, that’s not the situation, we do have this new variant of concern first identified in India that is now cropping up in other countries, and we’ve just got to take a very cautious approach. Asked about the UK government’s delay in shutting down travel from India, he said “India was added as soon as we saw a spike in rates and as soon as we saw there was a reason to”, denying that the delay had been political. At the time Indian case numbers were rising and the government took no action, UK prime minister Boris Johnson had been planning to visit India in his first major trip abroad since the pandemic, with the aim of pushing a post-Brexit UK-India trade deal. Unicef has urged rich members of the G7 to start donating vaccines to poor countries now, instead of waiting to donate leftovers all at once, saying many nations don’t have capacity to roll out huge amounts in one go. Unicef’s vaccine lead Lily Caprani told BBC Newsnight governments in the UK and other G7 nations “need to donate their doses to those low income countries now, while still vaccinating their populations at home.” “Low income countries need a steady supply that they can get off the tarmac and into the arms of health care workers... The unintended consequence of saving all these vaccines up to Christmas time is that countries won’t be able to absorb them and roll them out and therefore they could end up going to waste. We could see millions of doses of vaccines not used and expiring, and that will be a tragedy.” The World Health Organization has also called on Covid-19 vaccine manufacturers to give the Covax scheme first refusal on new doses, or commit half of their volumes to the global jab equity scheme. Our health editor Sarah Boseley asks the question this morning: Can we vaccinate the world against Covid by the end of 2022? As ambitious declarations go – even for Boris Johnson – it was a big one. At the weekend, the UK prime minister said he would urge the G7 leaders to vaccinate the world against Covid by the end of next year. But is this feasible? That rather depends on your definition. No country will vaccinate every adult. Vaccinating enough to achieve herd immunity, which could be 60% or 70%, is the real aim. It is possible to achieve that by December 2023, say experts, but only if the G7 leading economies move immediately to make it happen. The Covax scheme under the UN umbrella should have been the route to vaccination for low-income countries. It was designed as their lifeline. Covax signed contracts with manufacturers to buy 2bn doses by the end of this year. But it is stymied. Its main supplier is the Serum Institute of India, which is now churning out vaccines in response to the terrible surge in domestic cases and deaths and will not be able to fulfil its contracts to Covax or individual countries before the end of the year. Dr Bruce Aylward, senior adviser to the director general of the World Health Organization, who is heavily involved in the vaccine efforts, said: “This is where the UK becomes really important and the G7, because right now we’ve got this gap of death. In June, July, August, September, there’s no vaccine out there for love nor money, in terms of being able to procure it.” Read more of Sarah Boseley’s analysis here: Can we vaccinate the world against Covid by the end of 2022? The president of the Tokyo 2020 organising committee, Seiko Hashimoto, is speaking this morning, and she is setting out some of the procedures that will be undertaken to try to keep the games safe. So far, she’s said that media will not be able to use shared accommodation, and that the media will be GPS-tracked to ensure they don’t go into unauthorised areas. She has also said that they expect to start vaccinating Olympics-related staff by mid-June. Reuters note that foreign spectators have already been banned, and organisers are expected to make a decision late this month on domestic spectators. Toshiaki Endo, the vice-president of the Tokyo organising committee, has previously suggested to Reuters some spectators could be allowed into venues, although he personally preferred a total ban to calm persistent public opposition to the Games. On the downside, I just saw this tweet today, and now I can’t stop thinking about it either… Good morning, it is Martin Belam here in London taking over today’s blog. The biggest news in England is the extension of vaccinations to those aged 25 and over this morning. If you fall into that category you can book your shot at the NHS England site here. Northern Ireland has already been offering vaccines to anybody over 18, you can find out more here. Those in Scotland and Wales can find out the latest information for them here: NHS Scotland Gov.wales Reuters: New Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Tuesday that she would get her first Covid-19 shot at the end of next week, as the country prepared to receive another 1 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine. “For me, it’s been important that I allow those in the most at risk group... to be prioritised,” Ardern said in a news conference. “I’m choosing to be vaccinated at this point in order to play my role in demonstrating that I consider it to be absolutely safe and also really critical to keep others safe,” she said. China today pledged further assistance to Southeast Asian nations in battling the pandemic, the Associated Press reports. The country’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, told his Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) counterparts that China had already delivered 100 million doses of vaccine to Asean nations along with other materials and technical help. Wang said China would “urgently implement” the China-Asean Public Health Cooperation Initiative, continue to support the Asean Emergency Medical Materials Reserve and strengthen regional public health capacity-building. “China will work with Asean to overcome the outbreak as soon as possible,” Wang told a meeting of ministers. He said the sides should explore establishing an expert panel to strengthen cooperation throughout the vaccine process, from research to use, and work to build production and distribution centres to help make vaccines affordable and accessible in the region. Though Covid-19 was first detected in China in late 2019, the nation has largely stamped out domestic transmission, although it has been accused of insufficient transparency or even seeking to conceal the origins of the pandemic. Beijing has been building influence with Asean, despite frictions with some members of the bloc over competing territorial claims in the South China Sea. Welcome to another day of the pandemic, and our continuing global coverage of the latest developments. Below are some of the key updates from the last day. Canada is preparing to ease birder restrictions for vaccinated travellers, Bloomberg reports. A top Japanese virologist and government adviser has warned of the risks of spreading infections during the Tokyo Olympics. Australia’s state of Victoria is on track to ease restrictions on residents, currently in a lockdown to deal with an outbreak of the Delta variant, authorities said. India’s government will provide free vaccinations for all adults, Prime Minister Narendra Modi says, as the capital New Delhi and financial hub Mumbai ease lockdowns on falling infection levels. A new coronavirus antibody drug appears to show promise in mouse studies, according to a study published in Nature. The Czech Republic has announced it will reopen its borders to EU and Serbian citizens on June 21. Just days before the start of the Euros, Spain’s football players and staff have returned negative Covid-19 tests after captain Sergio Busquets had to go home and quarantine. There was “delight across Ireland” as the country reopened pubs, restaurants and leisure facilities. Central Park is to host an “all-star” concert in August to mark New York’s comeback after the pandemic. New York governor Andrew Cuomo has announced that the state’s remaining coronavirus restrictions will be lifted when 70% of residents have had at least one vaccine dose.","charCount":"61170","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/nadeembadshah\">Nadeem Badshah</a> (now); <a href=\"profile/mattha-busby\">Mattha Busby</a>, <a href=\"profile/rhi-storer\">Rhi Storer</a>, <a href=\"profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a> and <a href=\"profile/helen-davidson\">Helen Davidson</a> (earlier)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/live/2021/jun/08/joe-manchin-voting-legislation-black-civil-rights-leaders-joe-biden-us-politics-latest-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-08T18:09:44Z","webTitle":"Manchin unmoved on voting rights despite meeting Black civil rights leaders – live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2021/jun/08/joe-manchin-voting-legislation-black-civil-rights-leaders-joe-biden-us-politics-latest-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/live/2021/jun/08/joe-manchin-voting-legislation-black-civil-rights-leaders-joe-biden-us-politics-latest-updates","fields":{"headline":"Manchin unmoved on voting rights despite meeting Black civil rights leaders – live","standfirst":"<ul><li>Democratic senator said in op-ed he won’t vote for voting rights legislation</li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jun/08/joe-manchin-voting-rights-senated-democrats-republicans\">Manchin’s hard no on voting bill leaves Democrats seeking new path</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2021/jun/08/joe-manchin-voting-legislation-black-civil-rights-leaders-joe-biden-us-politics-latest-updates?page=with:block-60bf85f38f0827600c04c922#block-60bf85f38f0827600c04c922\">Senate report on US Capitol attack finds broad failings</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2018/sep/17/guardian-us-morning-briefing-sign-up-to-stay-informed\">Sign up to receive First Thing – our daily briefing by email</a></li></ul>","trailText":"Democratic senator had written op-ed on why he won’t vote for voting rights legislation for which he was a key vote","byline":"Vivian Ho","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2a930b27439ffa540b008928e4effdffb6af806b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a930b27439ffa540b008928e4effdffb6af806b/0_263_7873_4727/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Manchin in Washington DC. \" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Manchin in Washington DC. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<div id=\"block-60bfa28f8f08336d75f06d1c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-08T17:18:25.379Z\">6.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Manchin: 'I don't think anybody changed positions' on voting rights legislation</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>West Virginia senator <strong>Joe Manchin</strong> left his meeting with civil rights leaders unmoved on his decision to oppose the sweeping <strong>For the People Act</strong>, but called the conversation constructive. </p> <p>“We had a constructive conversation.

I think everybody pretty much knows the importance of what we’re doing,” Manchin said. “And I think I’m very much concerned about our democracy, protecting people’s voting rights.” Civil rights leaders that met with Manchin - NAACP President Derrick Johnson, the Rev Al Sharpton, National Urban League President Marc Morial, National Council of Negro Women President Johnnetta Cole, Lawyers’ Committee President Damon Hewitt, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights interim President Wade Henderson and the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation President Melanie Campbell - were measured in their response. The readout from the meeting read: In a very constructive meeting today, national civil rights leaders met with Senator Manchin to share our policy priorities and concerns related to voting rights and police reform. Specifically, the groups expressed their collective views on the need for Congress to pass both the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, and the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. The two voting rights bills are a top priority and essential to protect the freedom to vote. There continues to be an unprecedented partisan wave of state legislative proposals that are aimed at denying the right to vote — particularly for Black and Brown people. The leaders also conveyed to Senator Manchin that a minority of senators must not be able to abuse the filibuster to impede much needed progress. Congress must act so all Americans have meaningful access to the ballot. Vice-President Kamala Harris, who has been taking some criticism for her blunt speech in Guatemala to Central American migrants to “do not come” to US, is now getting some backlash from Republicans for an NBC interview she did on this same trip. Reminder: Joe Biden tasked Harris in March with efforts to stem migration at the US-Mexican border. On her first foreign trip, NBC’s Lester Holt asked if she had any plans to visit the border. “At some point, you know, we are going to the border,” Harris said. “We’ve been to the border. So this whole, this whole, this whole thing about the border. We’ve been to the border. We’ve been to the border.” “You haven’t been to the border,” Holt responded. “I, and I haven’t been to Europe. And I mean, I don’t - I don’t understand the point that you’re making,” Harris said with a laugh. Harris has maintained that her focus is on “the root causes of migration.” “I care about this and I care about what’s happening at the border. I’m in Guatemala because my focus is dealing with the root causes of migration,” Harris said. “There may be some who think that that is not important, but it is my firm belief that if we care about what’s happening at the border, we better care about the root causes and address them.” Vice-President Kamala Harris is in Mexico now, meeting with Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador. Reminder that the Senate report on the Capitol attack comes just weeks after Republicans blocked efforts to establish a bipartisan, 9/11-style commission to investigate the events of 6 January. The first – and possibly the last – bipartisan review into the 6 January attack on the US Capitol uncovered failings on all fronts before the attack as well as breakdowns between intelligence agencies and a lack of preparation by the Capitol police. “This report is important in the fact that it allows us to make some immediate improvements to the security situation here in the Capitol,” said Michigan senator Gary Peters, the chairman of the homeland security and governmental affairs committee, which conducted the investigation along with the Senate rules committee. “But it does not answer some of the bigger questions that we need to face, quite frankly, as a country and as a democracy.” Read more about the report’s findings here: Joseph Blount Jr, president and CEO of the Colonial Pipeline Company, is testifying before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee about the ransomware attack last month that knocked out gas delivery up and down the East Coast. The Justice Department announced yesterday that it recovered $2.3m of the roughly $4.4m that the company paid in a cryptocurrency ransom to a gang of criminal hackers known as DarkSide. It appears the meeting between Joe Manchin and civil rights leaders has come to an end. In more voting rights news: following the Sunday oped in which Democratic senator Joe Manchin committed against voting for the For The People Act, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is saying the House will move on the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. Some recap: the For The People Act would ensure automatic and same-day registration, place limits on gerrymandering and restore voting rights for felons. The John Lewis Act, named after the late Georgia Democratic congressman, would reauthorize voting protections established in the civil rights era but eliminated by the supreme court in 2013. Manchin said he would support the John Lewis Act. His major concern with the For The People Act is that it was not bipartisan. Pelosi made clear that the John Lewis Act is not a substitute for the For The People Act. Former President Barack Obama went on CNN last night to criticize how Republicans have been “cowed into accepting” a series of positions that “would be unrecognizable and unacceptable even five years ago or a decade ago”. In an interview with Anderson Cooper, Obama spoke of the 6 January attack on the US Capitol: “Suddenly you have large portions of the elected Congress going along with the falsehood that there were problems with the election.” He expressed disappointment in Republican elected officials, saying that he understood that while it was politically difficult to go against the lies and conspiracy theories being peddled among their base, it was the right thing to do. “I didn’t expect that there would be so few people who would say, ‘I don’t mind losing my office because this is too important. America is too important. Our democracy is too important’,” Obama said. “We didn’t see that.” “I’m still the hope and change guy,” Obama said. “My hope is the tides will turn, but that does require each of us to understand that this experiment in democracy is not self-executing. It doesn’t happen just automatically. It happens because each successive generation says ‘these values, these truths, we hold self-evident. This is important. We’re going to invest in it and sacrifice for it, even when it’s not politically convenient’.” Vice-President Kamala Harris travels to Mexico today to meet with the country’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador. But Harris is already drawing some criticism on her first official foreign trip. In Guatemala yesterday, Harris was blunt in telling would-be migrants “do not come” to the US border. Her spokeswoman, Symone Sanders, appeared to try to soften that statement today: The Guardian’s Julian Borger looks into some other questions raised by the measures Harris announced in Guatemala: Hello, live blog readers. Hope you’re all doing well. Two days after publishing an op ed on why he won’t vote for voting rights legislation for which he was a key vote, Democratic West Virginia senator Joe Manchin will meet with critics on the left today. Black and civil rights leaders have long fought against what many Democrats have categorized as Republican efforts to restrict voter access in communities of color. And they’re not happy. Manchin’s decision leave Democrats scrambling on what to do next on the For the People Act, which would ensure automatic and same-day registration, place limits on gerrymandering and restore voting rights for felons. It comes as Joe Biden said he would “fight like heck” for voting protections, putting Vice-President Kamala Harris in charge of the White House’s efforts. Our voting rights reporter Sam Levine takes a deeper look at the impact of Manchin’s decision here:","charCount":"8157","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/vivian-ho\">Vivian Ho</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2021/jun/08/french-open-quarter-finals-rybakina-pavlyuchenkova-zverev-tsitsipas-medvedev","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-08T18:01:01Z","webTitle":"French Open: Zverev routs Davidovich Fokina to reach semis – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2021/jun/08/french-open-quarter-finals-rybakina-pavlyuchenkova-zverev-tsitsipas-medvedev","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2021/jun/08/french-open-quarter-finals-rybakina-pavlyuchenkova-zverev-tsitsipas-medvedev","fields":{"headline":"French Open: Zverev routs Davidovich Fokina to reach semis – as it happened","standfirst":"<p>Alexander Zverev moved through the gears in a 6-4, 6-1, 6-1 win to reach his first Paris semi-final after a pair of epic women’s quarter-finals</p>","trailText":"Alexander Zverev moved through the gears in a 6-4, 6-1, 6-1 win to reach his first Paris semi-final after a pair of epic women’s quarter-finals","byline":"Niall McVeigh (now) and John Brewin (earlier)","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fbb60cfb96f7cb5672f08fddd0716628811bde49\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fbb60cfb96f7cb5672f08fddd0716628811bde49/0_159_8640_5184/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alexander Zverev is into his first French Open semi-final after a dominant win.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alexander Zverev is into his first French Open semi-final after a dominant win.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thibault Camus/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<div id=\"block-60bfaff58f0827600c04cc31\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-08T18:01:01.792Z\">7.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>That’s all from today’s live blog; I’ll leave you with Tumaini Carayol’s roundup of the women’s quarter-finals.

Let’s learn a little more about the two players involved.</p> <p><strong>Tamara Zidansek</strong> is the world No 85, and the true outsider of the four. The Slovenian had never been past the second round at a slam before this run, which began with a first-round comeback win over the No 6 seed, Bianca Andreescu. Zidansek has played in and lost two WTA Tour finals, both on clay, most recently in Colombia last month.</p> <p>Her opponent, <strong>Paula Badosa</strong>, was promoted to No 33 seed when Alison Riske withdrew. The former junior French Open champion is a rising star on clay, beating Sloane Stephens and Jelena Ostapenko on a run to the fourth round here in 2020. While her path to the quarters was eased by Naomi Osaka’s withdrawal, the Spaniard still had to overcome former finalist Marketa Vondrousova to reach the last eight.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60be94538f0837b8708e089f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-08T09:38:08.183Z\">10.38am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The quarter-finals begin at Roland Garros and while the biggest names feature later today or tomorrow, we start with a fascinating four-way battle to reach new heights. In the bottom half of the women’s draw, four players remain: Slovenia’s Tamara Zidansek, Spain’s Paula Badosa, Kazakhstan’s Elena Rybakina and her Russian doubles partner, Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. </p> <p>Of the quartet, only Pavlyuchenkova has reached a grand slam quarter-final before, and now one of them will be in the final on Saturday. Experience arguably makes Pavlyuchenkova the favourite but in truth, all four women will fancy their chances. Zidansek and Badosa are first up on Court Philippe-Chatrier.</p> <p>Later on, Alexander Zverev looks to continue his impressive form against the only man outside the top 10 seeds to reach the quarters: Spanish youngster Alejandro Davidovich Fokina. In the evening session Stefanos Tsitsipas takes on Daniil Medvedev, the No 2 seed who had never won a match here before this year.</p> </div>   </div>","wordcount":"5945","firstPublicationDate":"2021-06-08T09:40:59Z","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2021-06-08T18:03:53Z","liveBloggingNow":"false","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/p/hyg7v","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/fbb60cfb96f7cb5672f08fddd0716628811bde49/0_159_8640_5184/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","isLive":"true","bodyText":"That’s all from today’s live blog; I’ll leave you with Tumaini Carayol’s roundup of the women’s quarter-finals. Stay tuned for his report on tonight’s late game, with Stefanos Tsitsipas taking on Daniil Medvedev. Thanks for reading, and au revoir. Here is Wednesday’s order of play on Court Philippe-Chatrier: [24] Coco Gauff v Barbora Krejcikova [17] Maria Sakkari v Iga Swiatek [8] [3] Rafael Nadal v Diego Schwartzman [10] Evening match: [1] Novak Djokovic v Matteo Berrettini [9] Zverev will play either Stefanos Tsitsipas or Daniil Medvedev in the semi-finals, so one of those three horsemen of the Next Gen will reach the final. And probably lose to Rafa Nadal, but one step at a time, I suppose. “It’s nice to be in the semi-finals, but just being there doesn’t satisfy me. I think I’m playing pretty well,” Zverev tells Marion Bartoli in his on-court interview. “My baseline play really improved after the first set. [Alejandro] has improved a lot, this was his first grand slam quarter-final, and I don’t think it’ll be his last.” Twice in succession, Zverev gets around the Davidovich serve and clubs it away for a winner. It’s amazing the gap that has opened up between the two players in the last hour. Two match points, and he takes the first with a crisp backhand down the line. Third set: Zverev 6-4, 6-1, 5-1* Davidovich Fokina (*denotes next server) Credit to Zverev, of course – he has raised his game from the muddle of the first set – particularly on his first serve. It’s a dominant hold, capped with a third ace of the match, and he’s just one game away. Third set: Zverev 6-4, 6-1, *4-1 Davidovich Fokina (*denotes next server) The final curtain is looming for Davidovich, who once again lets a promising position on serve slip. An in-court return is enough for Zverev, as his opponent thrashes his forehand into the net. Third set: Zverev 6-4, 6-1, 3-1* Davidovich Fokina (*denotes next server) Zverev is rattling through his service games at a rate now. His likely semi-final opponent will be Stefanos Tsitsipas or Daniil Medvedev; they meet in the evening match after this. Third set: Zverev 6-4, 6-1, *2-1 Davidovich Fokina (*denotes next server) Davidovich gets a service hold, ending Zverev’s run of seven straight games. Here’s Tumaini Carayol on the earlier women’s quarter-finals, both of which were epic, down-to-the-wire battles: Third set: Zverev 6-4, 6-1, 2-0* Davidovich Fokina (*denotes next server) Zverev has a habit of getting caught up in five-set battles at slams, and he started in Paris by going two sets down to qualifier Oscar Otte. Since then, he’s rattled off a Nadalesque 14 straight sets and is in cruise control here, holding to 15. Third set: Zverev 6-4, 6-1, *1-0 Davidovich Fokina (*denotes next server) Davidovich Fokina is in trouble again straight away, 15-40 down – but produces a big cross-court winner and deploys that handy angled drop shot again to rescue things. And then, alas, a double fault at deuce – and a ferocious Zverev return gets the break. Davidovich threatens to prolong the set with a couple of smart returns, but Zverev cranks up the first serve speed and blasts his way to a two-set lead. Second set: Zverev 6-4, *5-1 Davidovich Fokina (*denotes next server) This is getting away from Davidovich Fokina now; he’s getting outgunned from the baseline, and the unforced error count is creeping up. Without having to do too much, Zverev gets the double break, and will serve for the second set. Second set: Zverev 6-4, 4-1* Davidovich Fokina (*denotes next server) What Zverev is doing well is just keeping it simple, finding the baseline with his shots, and allowing his opponents half-chances in the knowledge that he will probably miss a few. He moves 4-1 ahead with a searching forehand down the line, followed by a clipped cross-court volley. Second set: Zverev 6-4, *3-1 Davidovich Fokina (*denotes next server) ADF pulls out his trademark drop shot at 0-15 down; risky, but it pays off. He edges a spectacular net rally but that inconsistency strikes again, three misses surrendering the break to Zverev. Second set: Zverev 6-4, 2-1* Davidovich Fokina (*denotes next server) Zverev holds to love, with ADF rushing in on his second serve at 40-0 down, only to push his return beyond the baseline. Second set: Zverev 6-4, *1-1 Davidovich Fokina (*denotes next server) Davidovich Fokina still can’t string many good points together, and looks like he’d rather be anywhere else. Another stop-start service game, but he follows in a big first serve to get a welcome hold. Second set: Zverev 6-4, 1-0* Davidovich Fokina (*denotes next server) Sascha Zverev is a set to the good without having to get close to top gear, and he holds comfortably here. Can his opponent stop this game getting away from him? First serves in: Zverev 43%, Davidovich Fokina 44%. Winners: Zverev 5, Davidovich Fokina 8. Unforced errors: Zverev 11, Davidovich Fokina 17. That was the first set; now let us never speak of it again. First set: Zverev *6-4 Davidovich Fokina (*denotes next server) I’ll level with you, this has not been great so far, and both players might feel they could be well ahead if they could only find some form. Davidovich Fokina is certainly frustrated, remonstrating with his box as Zverev repels him repeatedly. A double fault hands Zverev a set point, and when he does get a second serve in, he nets his very next shot. First set: Zverev 5-4* Davidovich Fokina (*denotes next server) The Spaniard channels his anger more usefully to win the first two rallies, but Zverev’s high, bouncing serve gets him out of trouble. But with the first set in his grasp, Zverev rattles the net cord with a routine forehand, then double faults. First set: Zverev *5-3 Davidovich Fokina (*denotes next server) Davidovich Fokana is starting to struggle a little with Zverev’s raw speed, and a couple of mistimed swipes hand over break point. He then sends a cross-court backhand well wide, and hurls his racket to the ground. It springs up and into the arms of an impossibly cool patron sat courtside, who simply hands it back. First set: Zverev 4-3* Davidovich Fokina (*denotes next server) Zverev hasn’t been past the quarter-finals here, having run into Novak Djokovic and Dominic Thiem in 2018 and 2019. It’s been a slow start as the favourite here, but he holds to love here behind an increasingly potent first serve. First set: Zverev *3-3 Davidovich Fokina (*denotes next server) Fun fact: both of these players were born in Western Europe to Russian parents. OK, maybe it wasn’t that fun. Neither is this game until it bursts to life at 15-30, Zverev winning a rapid-fire net battle that gets a sleepy crowd going. He gets the break as Davidovich Fokina nets; the fourth break in the first six games. First set: Zverev 2-3* Davidovich Fokina (*denotes next server) Hawkeye shows the umpire was correct, despite Zverev’s performative whining. Davidovich Fokina pounces on this lapse in concentration to pick up two break points, and he takes the second as Zverev takes his eye off a volley and slaps it into the net. First set: Zverev *2-2 Davidovich Fokina (*denotes next server) ADF serves up his first double fault, and Zverev brings up two break points with a cross-court zinger that stops his opponent in his tracks. Davidovich Fokina gets back to deuce with a drop shot, but his next effort is wild. On break point, Zverev thinks a Davidovich forehand has landed out and protests at length to the umpire. Davidovich gets on with it, and closes out the hold. First set: Zverev 2-1 Davidovich Fokina* (*denotes next server) Zverev holds for the first time behind a booming, if misfiring first serve. There’s a double fault in the mix as he holds to 30. First set: Zverev *1-1 Davidovich Fokina (*denotes next server) Zverev extends his 6’6” frame to flick a passing shot back across court, earning a break point. He wins the next battle at the net, and breaks straight back. First set: Zverev 0-1* Davidovich Fokina (*denotes next server) Will we get another marathon quarter-final here? Alejandro Davidovich Fokina, or ADF as he is now known, makes a strong start, bossing the first two rallies. He earns three points as Zverev nets, and although Zverev battles back to 30-40, ADF seals the break with a tricky little drop shot. The players are on court knocking up. Zverev has a 2-0 head-to-head record over his Spanish opponent. Zverev has faced off-field allegations in the last year, and while we are going to focus on the match once it starts, it’s a situation I feel should be mentioned when we cover his matches. Next up, it’s Alexander Zverev against Alejandro Davidovich Fokina in the first men’s quarter-final. These two will have expected to have been on court at 3pm (BST); in reality, it’ll be almost two hours later. Third set: Rybakina 7-6 2-6 7-9 Pavlyuchenkova Pavlyuchenkova is, once again, just one game from that elusive grand slam semi-final. And now just two points away as Rybakina snatches at a forehand. An ace, of all things, levels the game at 30-all – but a short ball is battered away by Pavlyuchenkova. Match point ... and Rybakina double faults! Third set: *Rybakina 7-6 2-6 7-8 Pavlyuchenkova (*denotes next server) It helps in these situations if you can win your service games quickly, so it’s good news for Pavlyuchenkova as she motors to 40-0. Rybakina makes her work for it, more of those flat groundstrokes cutting the gap to 40-30, before a mishit return hands over the game. Third set: Rybakina 7-6 2-6 7-7 Pavlyuchenkova* (*denotes next server) A chance for Pavlyuchenkova here as she clubs a forehand winner into the corner for 0-30. Rybakina is under pressure, but twice digs out shots from under her feet, and gets a reprieve as Pav nets a return. A quite brilliant, reaching backhand down the line gets Rybakina over the line. Third set: Rybakina* 7-6 2-6 6-7 Pavlyuchenkova (*denotes next server) Pav tries to end a 20-shot rally with a drop shot, but Rybakina is onto it and tucks the winner away. More huge hitting from Pavlyuchenkova gets the job done. All of this is great news for Magda Linette and Bernarda Pera, who are due to play these two in the doubles tomorrow. Third set: Rybakina 7-6 2-6 6-6 Pavlyuchenkova* (*denotes next server) Niall here, jumping back in. This quarter-final, like the Zidansek v Badosa epic earlier, is going the distance as Rybakina holds to 15. No tie-breaks, remember. Third set: Rybakina* 7-6 2-6 5-6 Pavlyuchenkova (*denotes next server) And Pavlyuchenkova holds well, too, her shot for 40-0 a beaut. But back comes Rybakina. Pavlyuchenkova attempts an ace to seal it, and misses. The second serve is gobbled up. 40-30. Then Rybakina goes for glory and goes long, and a squeal from Pavlyuchenkova shows her delight. Third set: Rybakina 7-6 2-6 5-5* Pavlyuchenkova (*denotes next server) We begin with a fine return of serve for 0-15, then Rybakina whips a winner home for 15-15. Then she serves an ace. Then Pavlyuchenkova cannot keep her return in so it’s 40-15. Rybakina holds, and holds well. Third set: Rybakina* 7-6 2-6 4-5 *Pavlyuchenkova (*denotes next server) Sudden death is upon us, pretty much. Rybakina looks to the sky at a miscued return that lets her opponent off to readily. Then an attempted winner goes wide. A break point in the next would win this. Third set: Rybakina* 7-6 2-6 4-4 Pavlyuchenkova (*denotes next server) Rybakina powers back, her winner for 30-0 clanging off the racquet. Then Pavlyuchenkova’s engine gets her in place to bully a double forehand winner. It goes to 30-30 but an ace puts Rybakina in pole, and she scoops in an easy winner to level this set. Third set: Rybakina 7-6 2-6 3-4 *Pavlyuchenkova (*denotes next server) They are now slugging it out with each other, with Rybakina walloping a winner to level at 15-15. It goes to 30-30 - tiredness now also a factor - then 40-30. A hold for Pavlyuchenkova and one she audibly celebrates. Third set: Rybakina* 7-6 2-6 3-3 Pavlyuchenkova (*denotes next server) Levels, you devils. It goes to 30-30 and the potential for another wobble is upon us. Then a drop shot forces a break point as Rybakina can only scrabble into the net. And it happens, too. Third set: Rybakina 7-6 2-6 3-2 *Pavlyuchenkova (*denotes next server) Rybakina gains control, with a drop shot to go to 0-30 a real power move. She gets three break points, and Pavlyuchenkova goes long with an attempted saver. Another break. Third set: Rybakina* 7-6 2-6 2-2 Pavlyuchenkova (*denotes next server) Rybakina holds her serve well enough, and we are dead level in this final set. It’s anyone’s game at this point. Third set: Rybakina 7-6 2-6 1-2 *Pavlyuchenkova (*denotes next server) Rybakina is throwing so much at the shots, but seems to lack the rhythm to go with it. But at 15-30 there is a glimmer of a chance. It goes to two break points. The first is saved by a winner to the back of the court. The second is not saved. The Kazakh is back in this, the drought is over. Third set: Rybakina* 7-6 2-6 0-2 Pavlyuchenkova (*denotes next server) It goes to 0-30, and Pavlyuchenkova then climbs to 15-40. And a long backhand takes another break and a sixth successive game. Third set: Rybakina 7-6 2-6 0-1 *Pavlyuchenkova (*denotes next server) Pavlyuchenkova, still smeared in clay, seems to have the bit between her teeth. She’s eager to keep up her momentum, though a first double fault doesn’t much help and she is taken to deuce by a scything forehand winner from Rybakina. But she biffs a ball that bounces up to land game point. Then comes an ace down the line, taking the risk to win a fifth game in a row. Second set: Rybakina* 7-6 2-6 Pavlyuchenkova (*denotes next server) A double fault starts off the game, and then comes a whipping winner. Set points arrives on another break point. That’s seen off as Rybakina comes to the net. Then comes another as Pavlyuchenkova gains an advantage on deuce. And she takes it, to take the first set off Rybakina all tournament. Second set: Rybakina 7-6 2-5 *Pavlyuchenkova (*denotes next server) Pavlyuchenkova blazes through her next service game and has the next two games to win the second set. Rybakina seems to have lost concentration. Second set: Rybakina* 7-6 2-4 Pavlyuchenkova (*denotes next server) Break points on a previously all but unblemished serve. It goes to deuce but another chance comes up. That’s coughed up, and Pavlyuchenkova goes too long in trying to gobble it up. A series of deuces follow. Who will crack? Pavlyuchenkova thunders a double-handed backhand beyond reach before she then slips on the court as her opponent plays the shot and misses. She’s covered in shale, and there’s some talk of impeding in the commentary box but a break it is. Big chance now. Second set: Rybakina 7-6 2-3 *Pavlyuchenkova (*denotes next server) A racquet change from Rybakina as Pavlyuchenkova’s serve continues to impress. Rybakina goes long and it continues with serve. Second set: Rybakina* 7-6 2-2 Pavlyuchenkova (*denotes next server) Nice winner from Pavlyuchenkova to go 15-30 down but her opponent’s serve is strong and she works her own winner before acing the winner. Second set: Rybakina 7-6 1-2 *Pavlyuchenkova (*denotes next server) Again, Pavlyuchenkova looks strong on her serve. Another tiebreak here cannot be ruled out. Second set: Rybakina* 7-6 1-1 Pavlyuchenkova (*denotes next server) And Rybakina responds in kind, including a bullied smash to go 40-0 up, which is then served out. Second set: Rybakina 7-6 0-1 *Pavlyuchenkova (*denotes next server) Pavlyuchenkova blasts back, and serves out a hold of service to love. No sign of a wobble despite losing the first set. Rybakina steals into an early 2-0 lead, then an ace takes her to 3-0. She then clatters a winner for 4-0, then comes 5-0. A drinks break is taken at 5-1, and Pavlyuchenkova has a mountain to climb. A skidding backhand winner will do for starters but then it’s four set points. That’s collected on second serve. First set: Rybakina* 6-6 Pavlyuchenkova (*denotes next server) Farewell, Niall, and hello Cleveland. Neat net play from Pavlyuchenkova powers her way to 30-0 up, then a drop pulls Rybakina into it, before something of a fluke take her to game point. That’s served out and it’s a tiebreak. First set: Rybakina 6-5 Pavlyuchenkova* (*denotes next server) Rybakina has lost her way a little; from 4-1 up, she slips 0-30 down here but rescues things with some better first serves. Another double fault and we’re back to deuce. Pav goes down the line with a backhand, but misses – then nets a second serve. Time to hand over to John Brewin, who will guide you through this first set and beyond. First set: *Rybakina 5-5 Pavlyuchenkova (*denotes next server) Pavlyuchenkova grinds out a big-hitting hold, Rybakina still going for her shots and not always making them. 18 winners, 16 unforced errors from Rybakina. First set: Rybakina 5-4 Pavlyuchenkova* (*denotes next server) Nice work from Rybakina, stepping in behind her serve and lifting a two-handed backhand down the line. For every smooth winner, there’s a slightly wild miss, but she gets the hold and makes her opponent serve to stay in the set. First set: *Rybakina 4-4 Pavlyuchenkova (*denotes next server) The first signs of frustration from Rybakina at a missed winner, an eighth unforced error on her forehand. She had looked like running away with this set but Pavlyuchenkova has pulled level now. First set: Rybakina 4-3 Pavlyuchenkova* (*denotes next server) Pavlyuchenkova has stopped her doubles partner running away with this first set, but can she make a dent on her serve? A double fault, and soft second serve, allows Pav to move 15-30 ahead. Rybakina double-faults again but is let off as Pav loops a return long. A much better effort allows her to dominate at deuce, earning another break point – but Rybakina reads her and blasts a passing shot down the line. Pav does get the break as Rybakina goes long, and we’re back on serve. First set: *Rybakina 4-2 Pavlyuchenkova (*denotes next server) Rybakina is using her height advantage, stepping onto any mid-court balls and driving them away. Pav (yes, I’m calling her Pav) gets back in the game with a drop shot, then latches on to an underhit smash and whips it back across court. Rybakina returns the favour with a backhand down the line. Deuce, and Pav cranks up the power for a welcome hold. First set: Rybakina 4-1 Pavlyuchenkova* (*denotes next server) Pavlyuchenkova offers a reminder of what she can do with a backhand cross-court rocket at 15-40 down, but that’s all she can offer as Rybakina holds. First set: *Rybakina 3-1 Pavlyuchenkova (*denotes next server) Pavlyuchenkova sends a cross-court forehand wide, and is under pressure at 0-30. A limp, netted backhand brings up three break points for Rybakina. Pavlyuchenkova’s first serve isn’t firing but her second serve almost rescues her – until Rybakina dispatches a return into the far corner! First set: Rybakina 2-1 Pavlyuchenkova* (*denotes next server) Rybakina has found a better rhythm early on, her winner count already at eight as she holds comfortably. First set: *Rybakina 1-1 Pavlyuchenkova (*denotes next server) A solid opening service hold from Pavlyuchenkova, stifling a run of Rybakina winners with some big first serves. First set: Rybakina 1-0 Pavlyuchenkova* (*denotes next server) Pavlyuchenkova moves 0-30 up on the Rybakina serve but her opponent gets back to deuce, only for a nervy volley to offer up another break point. A short return allows Rybakina a routine winner, and a delicate drop shot helps her hold. Next up on Chatrier: Elena Rybakina takes on Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. There’s an eight-year gap between 29-year-old Pavlyuchenkova and Rybakina, who was born in Moscow but represents Kazakhstan. Improbably enough, the pair are doubles partners, and have a semi-final game together on Wednesday. Pavlyuchenkova has beaten Aryna Sabalenka and Victoria Azarenka on her way here, and is into her seventh grand slam quarter-final. The trouble is, she’s never made a semi-final. Rybakina is an emerging star who notably took out Serena Williams in the last 16 to reach the last eight at a slam for the first time. Tamara Zidansek speaks: “I was struggling a little bit [at the end of the second] but in the third set I managed to get my groove, and I was fighting really well.” Is she going to watch the next match? “A little bit ... I have some recovery to do, but I’ll keep an eye on it.” A terrific victory for the world No 85, who looks to have the game to climb much higher in the rankings. It’s Badosa’s turn to feel the tension now, and she sends a couple of tight forehands drifting beyond the lines. Suddenly, Zidansek has two match points. She misses a chance with the first, but senses Badosa is cracking, and powers a winner into the corner. She’s done it! What a ridiculous match this has been. For quality, drama and tension, it’s been better than plenty of grand slam finals. Third set: Zidansek 7-5, 4-6, 7-6 Badosa* (*denotes next server) Dogged defensive work from Zidansek this time, but she overcooks a sliced backhand and is under pressure at 15-30. Ack, the first serve is a mile off, and a double fault follows. Two break points ... the first saved with a ridiculous forehand smash down the line. And she does it again! Deuce ... and another double fault. She gets a lucky break, a forehand skidding off the service line. Another huge forehand winner, then a solid return from Badosa, and we are back to deuce. Badosa makes a mess of her cross-court return, but Zidansek nets that trusty drop shot. A seven-minute game now. Zidansek finds another long-range forehand winner and gets the better of the next rally, smashing the ball away to somehow hold serve! Third set: *Zidansek 7-5, 4-6, 6-6 Badosa (*denotes next server) Badosa opens with a zipping cross-court winner, then a double fault. A big serve and a flat volley into the corner gets her out of trouble. We’ve had 14 breaks of serve in this match, but none in the last eight games. Third set: Zidansek 7-5, 4-6, 6-5 Badosa* (*denotes next server) Badosa has found more consistency, cutting out the errors and making Zidansek win a lot more points. The Slovenian wins a key, 17-shot rally at 15-15 and closes out. Her resistance is getting to Badosa, who launches her racket towards her chair as a return flies wide. Third set: *Zidansek 7-5, 4-6, 5-5 Badosa (*denotes next server) No tie-breaks here; the first player to get two games ahead will win the match. Zidansek has the first chance but Badosa doesn’t give her a look in, going on the attack and powering to 40-0. A big first serve out wide seals a hold to love, and the pressure is back on her opponent. Third set: Zidansek 7-5, 4-6, 5-4 Badosa* (*denotes next server) Two hours on court, and these two still can’t be separated. Zidansek chooses the perfect time to land her first ace, and gets a comfortable hold with a trademark forehand winner. Third set: *Zidansek 7-5, 4-6, 4-4 Badosa (*denotes next server) Those last two points from Zidansek showed terrific touch, and she demonstrates it again here with a drop shot Badosa doesn’t bother chasing. Badosa’s turn to feel the nerves, and an eighth double fault follows – but a well-worked point gets her back to 30-all. At game point, she goes for her trusty double-handed backhand down the line – and misses. Badosa is doing just about enough on serve, though, and secures the hold with a deep slice that Zidansek floats back beyond the baseline. Third set: Zidansek 7-5, 4-6, 4-3 Badosa* (*denotes next server) The volume is rising from both players as we edge towards the two-hour mark. Badosa is finding the pace and power that eluded her early on, absolutely burying a winner at 30-15 down. Zidansek pounces on a net cord, finding the line with her forehand, and then brings out that tricky drop-volley again to edge back ahead. Third set: *Zidansek 7-5, 4-6, 3-3 Badosa (*denotes next server) From 2-0 up to 3-2 down, the pressure is now back on Badosa. She shakes it off, completing the hold with a cross-court volley and a triumphant, tension-relieving roar. Third set: Zidansek 7-5, 4-6, 3-2 Badosa* (*denotes next server) With Badosa wobbling on serve again and Zidansek rediscovering her accuracy, this feels very finely poised now. There are a lot more short points as the errors creep in, and Zidansek gets a welcome hold as Badosa’s return up the line drifts wide. Third set: *Zidansek 7-5, 4-6, 2-2 Badosa (*denotes next server) It’s crucial for Zidansek to keep in touch, because Badosa has already shown nerves on serve. Badosa starts well – a deft, sliding volley setting up 30-0 – but a delicate, cross-court drop shot from Zidansek changes the game. At break point, Badosa lands a risky backhand winner down the line, but Zidansek pulls out that drop shot again, and breaks back. That’s the 14th break of this match! Third set: Zidansek 7-5, 4-6, 1-2 Badosa* (*denotes next server) From 7-5, 4-2 up, Zidansek has lost six games on the spin, and badly needs to stop that run here. A crafty, angled drop shot turns the game her way at 15-30, and she gets the job done on second serve, Badosa’s return landing well wide. Third set: *Zidansek 7-5, 4-6, 0-2 Badosa (*denotes next server) Ramos gives Zidansek an informal warning over getting coaching from her team up in the stands. Badosa dishes up another double-fault, but rallies with a ferocious winner down the line. Zidansek has the chance to take it to deuce, but sends her volley a mile wide. She would have nailed that in the first two sets. Third set: Zidansek 7-5, 4-6, 0-1 Badosa* (*denotes next server) Here we go, then: the deciding set. Zidansek serves first and moves to 30-0 easily enough – but then Badosa strikes back, stepping forward to turn the game around and earn a break point. She takes it as Zidansek beams a forehand well wide. Second set: *Zidansek 7-5, 4-6 Badosa (*denotes next server) The change in body language is stark; Badosa is now bouncing around the court, with Zidansek looking deflated as she sends a hopeful backhand wide. Set point for Badosa, won with a whipped forehand that Zidansek can’t return. Second set: Zidansek 7-5, 4-5 Badosa* (*denotes next server) Zidansek has the weight of the world on her shoulders, and double-faults for the first time to go 0-30 behind. She tries to change it up with a drop shot, but it’s always falling short, and a wild forehand completes an almost zero-effort break for Badosa, who will now serve to level the match. Second set: *Zidansek 7-5, 4-4 Badosa (*denotes next server) At this point, both players would probably rather not be serving – and Badosa quickly slips 0-30 down. Some overly defensive play from Zidansek allows Badosa to bounce back, however, and a big first serve seals the hold. Second set: Zidansek 7-5, 4-3 Badosa* (*denotes next server) Tamara Zidansek is two games away now, but her struggles continue on first serve and some aggressive baseline play gets Badosa two break-back points. On second serve, Badosa’s deep return proves enough to earn another break – the fourth in a row. Second set: *Zidansek 7-5, 4-2 Badosa (*denotes next server) When Badosa has her opponent on the back foot, self-doubt seems to creep in. A wonky forehand is followed by a double fault, then a weak second serve which is ruthlessly put away by Zidansek. Three break points, and a break quickly gifted by Badosa, who is running out of games. Second set: Zidansek 7-5, 3-2 Badosa* (*denotes next server) Badosa senses a chance at 15-30, on Zidansek’s second serve. She pounds a return through her opponent, and seals the break as Zidansek, feeling the pressure, mishits. Back on serve in the second set! Second set: *Zidansek 7-5, 3-1 Badosa (*denotes next server) Paula Badosa has enjoyed a really impressive clay-court season, beating Ash Barty in Charleston, reaching the semi-finals in Madrid and then winning in Belgrade. It’s all in danger of ending with a whimper here, the fourth double-fault a lowlight as she hands over three break points. She saves the first, but a forehand down the line is just wide, and Zidansek is now in charge of this match. Second set: Zidansek 7-5, 2-1 Badosa* (*denotes next server) Zidansek holds to 15, sealed with another forehand winner, struck from a lofty angle deep into the far corner. Second set: *Zidansek 7-5, 1-1 Badosa (*denotes next server) A big game for Badosa, who has lost three games in a row and still seems distracted by the umpire’s call that started the run. She stops the losing run here, and we stay on serve. Second set: Zidansek 7-5, 1-0 Badosa* (*denotes next server) Zidansek was the better player in that first set, and continues to push Badosa around the court, securing the hold by stepping in behind her serve and wrongfooting her opponent. If you’re just joining us (I’ve always wanted to say that ...) it’s been a cracking match so far, with Zidansek bouncing back brilliantly after going a double-break down. Badosa has not quite found top gear but it’s been high-quality stuff, short on the nerves and unforced errors you might expect from two players in their first slam quarter-final. First set: *Zidansek 7-5 Badosa (*denotes next server) Badosa powers to 30-love, only for Zidansek to hit back with a looping forehand return. That punchy, precise forehand gets her to 30-all, and then a set point as Badosa fails to chase her down. Badosa saves the first but presents another when an awkward overhead effort goes wide. This time, Zidansek takes it when her opponent nets! First set: Zidansek 6-5 Badosa* (*denotes next server) Second serve is a weak spot for both players, and Badosa is all over it here, creaming it back down the line. Stepping off the baseline, she has a routine volley – but shanks it long! She shakes it off, winning a scrappy rally to set up deuce. Badosa thinks she’s found the line with a passing shot, and lets out a yell – only for the umpire to overturn the call. Zidansek secures the hold with a lovely long-range drop shot. First set: *Zidansek 5-5 Badosa (*denotes next server) Badosa is under pressure at 15-30 down but Zidansek gifts her a point with an unforced error. From there, an almighty heave into the corner and a low, skidding volley get Badosa over the line. First set: Zidansek 5-4 Badosa* (*denotes next server) Zidansek quickly moves to 40-15, but an unstoppable cross-court backhand gets Badosa back in the game. A rare unforced error takes us to deuce, where we are treated to the match’s best rally so far – won by Zidansek with a double-handed, cross-court backhand that clips the line! Zidansek leads for the first time. First set: *Zidansek 4-4 Badosa (*denotes next server) New balls on the Badosa serve, and Zidansek fires her seventh forehand winner. Badosa digs in, applying plenty of side spin to her first serve, but Zidansek secures the break with a couple of zipping volleys that her opponent can’t handle. It’s the sixth break of serve in eight games! First set: Zidansek 3-4 Badosa* (*denotes next server) Badosa turns up the pace and carves out another break point, which she takes with a crunching forehand that Zidansek can’t retrieve. This isn’t the freestyle poetry, by the way. Or is it? First set: *Zidansek 3-3 Badosa (*denotes next server) Not any more! Quite a remarkable change of momentum in this first set; Badosa has lost her rhythm while Zidansek is timing her shots perfectly. She breaks back again, and we are back on serve. First set: Zidansek 2-3 Badosa* (*denotes next server) Zidansek gets her first service hold, largely steering clear of Badosa’s fearsome forehand and stepping in behind her serve. She’s fought her way back into this, but Badosa still has a break. First set: *Zidansek 1-3 Badosa (*denotes next server) She’s finding it tough on her own serve, so Zidansek senses the need to get after her opponent. An aggressive return game pays off, bringing up three break points, and she only needs one as Badosa goes long. First set: Zidansek 0-3 Badosa* (*denotes next server) Zidansek can’t really match Badosa for pace early on, so has to find a different approach, mixing up her angles nicely. The pressure tells at deuce, Zidansek netting a forehand and then getting quickly overpowered in a rally. It’s been a flying start from Paula Badosa. First set: *Zidansek 0-2 Badosa (*denotes next server) Badosa has started really well here, cruising through her first service game and looking much more comfortable than her opponent. Early days, though. First set: Zidansek 0-1 Badosa* (*denotes next server) Zidansek makes a nervy start on serve and presents Badosa with an early break point. She doesn’t take the first chance but a firm forehand sets up another, taken with a backhand down the line. The players are out and warming up on a sunny Court Philippe-Chatrier. Carlos Ramos is the umpire; you might remember him from the 2018 US Open final. In other news, it appears that due to some pretty widespread technical problems, you’re probably not able to read this blog just now. At last, a chance to try out some of my freestyle poetry ... The first women’s quarter-final gets under way shortly. Let’s learn a little more about the two players involved. Tamara Zidansek is the world No 85, and the true outsider of the four. The Slovenian had never been past the second round at a slam before this run, which began with a first-round comeback win over the No 6 seed, Bianca Andreescu. Zidansek has played in and lost two WTA Tour finals, both on clay, most recently in Colombia last month. Her opponent, Paula Badosa, was promoted to No 33 seed when Alison Riske withdrew. The former junior French Open champion is a rising star on clay, beating Sloane Stephens and Jelena Ostapenko on a run to the fourth round here in 2020. While her path to the quarters was eased by Naomi Osaka’s withdrawal, the Spaniard still had to overcome former finalist Marketa Vondrousova to reach the last eight. The quarter-finals begin at Roland Garros and while the biggest names feature later today or tomorrow, we start with a fascinating four-way battle to reach new heights. In the bottom half of the women’s draw, four players remain: Slovenia’s Tamara Zidansek, Spain’s Paula Badosa, Kazakhstan’s Elena Rybakina and her Russian doubles partner, Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. Of the quartet, only Pavlyuchenkova has reached a grand slam quarter-final before, and now one of them will be in the final on Saturday. Experience arguably makes Pavlyuchenkova the favourite but in truth, all four women will fancy their chances. Zidansek and Badosa are first up on Court Philippe-Chatrier. Later on, Alexander Zverev looks to continue his impressive form against the only man outside the top 10 seeds to reach the quarters: Spanish youngster Alejandro Davidovich Fokina. In the evening session Stefanos Tsitsipas takes on Daniil Medvedev, the No 2 seed who had never won a match here before this year.","charCount":"34996","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/niall-mcveigh\">Niall McVeigh</a> (now) and <a href=\"profile/john-brewin\">John Brewin</a> (earlier)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2021/jun/08/a-deep-thinker-robert-page-accidental-manager-wales-euro-2020","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-08T18:00:27Z","webTitle":"‘A deep thinker’: Robert Page, the accidental manager of Wales at Euro 2020","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/jun/08/a-deep-thinker-robert-page-accidental-manager-wales-euro-2020","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2021/jun/08/a-deep-thinker-robert-page-accidental-manager-wales-euro-2020","fields":{"headline":"‘A deep thinker’: Robert Page, the accidental manager of Wales at Euro 2020","standfirst":"<p>In Ryan Giggs’s absence a former Port Vale and Northampton manager renowned for his honesty has done a remarkable job </p>","trailText":"In Ryan Giggs’s absence a former Port Vale and Northampton manager renowned for his honesty has done a remarkable job ","byline":"Ben Fisher","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ca6dde3eb15caa8965b5837508918de69e6779f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ca6dde3eb15caa8965b5837508918de69e6779f/0_29_2410_1446/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robert Page applauds the Wales fans after the team’s final warm-up game for Euro 2020 against Albania.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robert Page applauds the Wales fans after the team’s final warm-up game for Euro 2020 against Albania.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Cook/CameraSport/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Robert Page has not savoured the array of trophies Ryan Giggs did across a glittering playing career but there is no doubting his pride at leading his country at a European Championship.

Andy Haldane said the government’s tax breaks for home buyers and increased demand from richer households with more savings following Coronavirus lockdowns were pushing prices up, and predicted they would worsen inequality. Haldane said at virtual conference on inequality organised by the University of Glasgow. “As things stand, the housing market in the UK is on fire,” “There’s a significant imbalance between incipient demand and available supply of houses, and because the laws of economic gravity have not been suspended, the result is pretty punchy rises in house prices.” The number of vacancies at US firms has hit a record, with around 9.3m positions unfilled in April. The proportion of people quitting their jobs, perhaps for a better paid opportunity elsewhere, also hit record levels. The World Bank has hiked its forecast for global growth this year to 5.6% this year, but warned that vaccine inequality means poorer nations are falling behind. A massive internet outage has affected websites including the Guardian, the UK government’s website gov.uk, Amazon and Reddit, leaving some sites inaccessible for more than an hour on Tuesday morning. Shares in Fastly, the source of the problem, have surged 7% since fixing the problem, which highlighted the crucial role of its content delivery network service (when it’s working, anyway) German factories have suffered a surprise drop in output, due to shortages of key components such as computer chips and the knock-on impact of the Suez Canal closure. Cryptocurrencies have fallen sharply, with bitcoin dropping around the $32,000 mark. The London Metal Exchange, the last remaining in-person trading floor in Europe, is to reopen on 6 September after its management decided not to permanently close the trading ring, which has been operating since 1877. Experts have warned that US tech companies, including Google, Amazon and Facebook, could pay less tax in the UK and several other big economies under global reforms agreed at the weekend by the G7. In a key stumbling block emerging days after the landmark deal, research from the TaxWatch campaign group indicates that the UK Treasury stands to lose about £230m from the taxes paid each year by four of the big US tech firms. Here are more of today’s stories: Goodnight. GW It’s been a tough day for cryptoassets. Bitcoin has fallen back to around $32,000, down around 7% today, meaning it’s lost over 10% in the last two days. That’s now 50% off its all-time high in April. Bitcoin has been on a downward path since early May, hit by worries over its environmental impact and a clampdown on mining and trading in China. This latest slump, though, after US officials managed to recover most of the bitcoin ransom paid to hackers that targeted America’s largest fuel pipeline, Colonial. It’s not clear how the Fed managed this, but it may have unnerved some bitcoin advocates (and also dented bitcoin’s attraction as the currency of choice for ransomers). Former US president Donald Trump also thumped bitcoin, telling Fox Business yesterday that: “Bitcoin, it just seems like a scam. I don’t like it because it’s another currency competing against the dollar.” Other digital currencies are also under the cosh, with ether down 12% over the last 24 hours and joke-coin Dogecoin losing 11.5%. Here’s Neil Wilson of Markets.com on bitcoin’s struggles. I’ve expounded on this too many times to add anything new, but suffice to say it’s not a currency – no one is spending it; it’s just monstrous speculation. Donald Trump’s fears about Bitcoin threatening the dollar are unfounded. In almost every single use case – except in the world of criminals, terrorists and non-fungible token collectors – you have to convert it back into fiat to use it (even to buy your Tesla), so I fail to see it as anything but a kind of pointless digital gold. The global economy is set for the fastest recovery from recession for more than 80 years, but poor nations are at risk of falling further behind wealthy countries amid slow progress with the Covid-19 vaccine, the World Bank has said. In its half-yearly outlook report, the Washington-based institution said the world economy was forecast to grow at 5.6% this year, in a sharp upgrade from previous estimates it made in January for growth of 4.1%. It said this would mark the fastest post-recession recovery in 80 years, fuelled by growth in a few major economies where rapid progress with the Covid-19 vaccine has enabled a faster return to relative normality. However, developing nations will continue struggling with the virus and its aftermath for longer, worsening divisions between rich and poor nations. Calling for a wider distribution of Covid-19 vaccines to low-income nations where progress has been slower, it said the world economy would remain about 2% below where it would have been without the pandemic by 2022 but that poorer countries were lagging behind. Sounding the alarm over the uneven recovery, the bank said about 90% of rich nations were expected to regain their pre-pandemic levels of GDP a head by 2022, compared with only about one-third of low-income countries. Back on Wall Street, shares in Fastly have actually rallied despite the cloud computing service causing today’s Internet outage. Fastly stock is up 5%, after its content delivery network (CDN) was identified as the problem behind the problems that afflicted major web site and media outlets today. One theory is that investors now know what a key role Fastly’s CDN operations play. Toby Stephenson, chief technology officer at IT and cyber security firm, Neuways, explains: “This incident highlights the reliance of many of the world’s biggest websites on content delivery networks (CDNs) such as Fastly. As there are so few of these CDN services, these outages can occur from time-to-time. Fastly’s shares had been down in pre-market trading, but picked up as its customers (including Amazon, Reddit, gov.uk, the Financial Times and the Guardian) reappeared online. Danni Hewson, AJ Bell financial analyst, says Fastly’s share price recovered quickly after its speedy resolution to the issue The cloud computing service hasn’t clarified what caused the issue but there will be undoubtedly be a lot of questions flying around from clients that lost money. So many eggs in so few baskets doesn’t make for a great recipe. Another day, another record high for Europe’s stock markets. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index has ended 0.1% higher at 454.01, a new closing high. But while France’s CAC gained 0.1%, Germany’s DAX dipped by 0.23% after the surprise drop in German factor output this morning. In the City, the FTSE 100 has closed 18 points higher at 7095, up 0.25% today. Thungela Resources, the South African coal business spun out of Anglo American this week, led the London risers - surging by almost 30%. That recovers most of Monday’s slump, when investors ditched the stock on its first day of trading. That selloff came after a short-seller accused Anglo American of having “massively underestimated” the environmental liabilities of Thungela, from the clean-up cost of its mines. Hospitality firms had a good day, with Intercontinental Hotels (+3.8%) and Premier Inns owner Whitbread (+3.4%) in the risers, along with asset manager Intermediate Capital (+5.9%) after it reported strong results this morning. Housebuilders declined, though, with Taylor Wimpey (-1.9%) and Barratt Development (-1.3%) in the fallers, along with airline group IAG (-1.5%) (after Goldman Sachs cut its rating on the British Airways owner). Engineering firm Melrose (-1.7%) and medical equipment manufacturer Smith &amp; Nephew (-1.9%) also dropped. Andy Haldane also told Tuesday’s seminar that uncertainty about the prospects for Britain’s labour market remained high even though employment and vacancies had bounced back quickly from the COVID crisis. Reuters explains: “We’ve still got more than 3 million workers on furlough across the UK, and that means that uncertainties about the future jobs market remain pretty acute,” he said. While government figures last week showed 3.4 million jobs were on furlough at the end of April, more timely survey data from the Office for National Statistics suggested the number had dropped to 2.1 million by mid-May. One solution to the UK’s red-hot housing market is to build more houses -- and address the imbalance between supply and demand. Otherwise, the boom is going to create deeper economic inequality, hurting those - particularly younger people - who aren’t able to afford a mortgage to get onto the housing ladder. Bloomberg explains: Bank of England Chief Economist Andy Haldane said the U.K. housing market is “on fire” and contributing to a growing wealth gap -- but there’s little that the central bank can do to fix structural issues. “As things stand, the housing market in the U.K. is on fire,” Haldane said at an event about inequality on Tuesday. “There’s a significant imbalance between incipient demand and available supply of houses, and because the laws of economic gravity have not been suspended, the result is pretty punchy rises in house prices.” The remarks underscore concerns about the impact that rising property prices are having on the ability of younger people and those on moderate wages to own their own home. Haldane said the structural issues in the market that are feeding the increase aren’t something central banks can fix. Without “doing something of a longstanding nature with the supply side of the U.K. housing market,” Haldane said, “inevitably we’ll see the sort of relentless rise in house prices relative to incomes that we’ve seen over the past 30 to 40 years.” More here. Andy Haldane’s warning that the UK housing market is on fire is backed up by the facts. Yesterday, Halifax reported that the average cost of a home rose by 1.3% in May alone - lifting the average selling price to a record £261,743. That’s a rise of 9.5% in the last year, far outstripping wage growth. Halifax predicted they could keep climbing due to the shortage of property, and strong demand for larger houses, better suited for homeworking, in more rural areas and sporting a garden. The large savings build up by some households is also pushing prices up, while record low interest rates make servicing a mortgage less expensive than in the past. A week ago, Nationwide said that a ‘race for space’ was driving double-digit growth in property prices, with younger buyers as keen on living in the country than in a big city. Online estate agent Rightmove has reported that a ‘mini boom’ is underway, fuelled by the government’s stamp duty holiday, particularly in Wales and the North West. And in March, mortgage lending hit a record high. Borrowers raced to beat the original deadline for the stamp duty tax break on purchases up to £500,000 (which was then extended until the end of June, and will drop to £250,000 until the end of September.). We know that the Bank of England is carefully monitoring Britain’s booming housing market. Deputy governor Sir Dave Ramsden told the Guardian that the bank was alert to signs of rising inflation: There is a risk that demand gets ahead of supply and that will lead to a more generalised pick-up in inflationary pressure. That’s something we are absolutely going to guard against. We are looking carefully at the housing market and a raft of real-term indicators. The number of job vacancies in the US has hit a record peak, as demand for labor surges as America’s economy recovers. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics has reported there were 9.28m job vacancies in the US in April, up from 8.2m in March, and the most since the survey began in December 2000. The ‘quits’ rate, which tracks how many people are choosing to leave their position, rose to 2.7% - the highest in the survey’s history too. Hospitality industries saw the largest increase in vacancies -- following the reopening of bars and restaurants as pandemic restrictions were eased this spring. The BLS says: Job openings increased in a number of industries with the largest increases in accommodation and food services (+349,000), other services (+115,000), and durable goods manufacturing (+78,000). The number of job openings decreased in educational services (-23,000) and in mining and logging (-8,000). The number of job openings increased in all four regions. Such a sharp jump in vacancies suggests the US labor market is tightening, and that firms are struggling to find staff. Last week’s Non-Farm Payroll show that recruitment slowed in April, with just 278,000 new hires (rising to 559,000 in May). But that still left more than seven million jobs still to recover, compared to pre-pandemic levels. Federal Reserve policymakers pay close attention to the JOLTS numbers for indications of labor market slack. This surge in vacancies will probably lead to more calls for more states to stop paying the extra $300 per week in unemployment benefits. But, it may also be a sign that US firms need to raise wages to attract staff. Plus, not everyone has been vaccinated -- and some workers find that childcare and other responsibilities are making it harder to return to work. Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane has said the UK’s housing market is “on fire”. This is due to government incentives for buyers, more demand from households that have accumulated greater savings during the pandemic, and a shortage of homes for sale, Haldane says. He added that the rise in house prices, which topped 10% in the 12 months to March according to official data, was likely to worsen pre-existing wealth inequalities. Speaking at a webinar on inequality organised by the University of Glasgow, Haldane said: As things stand, the housing market in the UK is on fire. The opening bell has rung on Wall Street, and stocks have inched higher, with the Nasdaq getting a boost from a rise in Tesla shares. Dow Jones up 15 points 34,645 S&amp;P 500 up 8 points, or 0.2%, at 4,235 Nasdaq up 64 points, or 0.47%, at 13,946 The Football Association has appointed the first female chair in its 157-year history, with the business executive Debbie Hewitt expected to take up the position in January. The appointment is subject to confirmation by the FA Council next month, but if the formalities are completed Hewitt will become the permanent successor to Greg Clarke, who resigned after making racially offensive remarks in front of a parliamentary committee. Hewitt has an extensive background in business that suggests a more polished approach to high-profile positions representing her employer. She is a former chief executive of RAC and the current nonexecutive chair at Visa Europe, the clothing brand White Stuff and the financial services group BGL, which owns price comparison site Compare The Market. Hewitt has also spent six years on the board of The Restaurant Group plc, which owns Wagamama and Frankie and Benny’s. She will step down from that role on taking up her FA position. “I’ve been passionate about football from a very young age and I’m excited by the opportunity to play my part in shaping the future of something that means so much to so many,” said Hewitt, who was awarded an MBE in 2011 for services to business and the public sector. Here’s the full story: The US trade deficit has narrowed slightly from its record high. The trade deficit dropped 8.2% to $68.9bn in April, the Commerce Department reports, thanks to a 1.1% rise in exports and a 1.4% drop in imports. April exports totalled $205bn, $2.3bn more than March exports, while April imports were $273.9bn, down $3.8bn. But March’s data has been revised up, to show a record trade gap of $75bn (up from the $74.4bn first reported). The US trade balance could improve further, as other major economies emerge from the pandemic and import more American-made goods. Small US firms are also planning to raise prices, in response to surging costs, the NFIB adds: In the US, small-business confidence has edged lower last month as inflation worries and hiring problems worry bosses. The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) Optimism Index has dipped by 0.2 points to a reading of 99.6 in May, ending a three-month run of increases. NFIB chief economist Bill Dunkelberg said in a statement that labor shortages and rising prices were worrying small business owners. “If small business owners could hire more workers to take care of customers, sales would be higher and getting closer to pre-COVID levels” “In addition, inflation on Main Street is rampant and small business owners are uncertain about future business conditions.” A net 27% of businesses said they planned to create new jobs in the next three months, up 6 points from April and a record high. More companies warned that jobs were hard to fill (vacancies have been running at record levels, with a new JOLTS report due later today). Economist Aaron Sojourner says the solution to the hiring problems is clear -- raise wages. The property website OnTheMarket has reported its first annual profit since being launched by a group of estate agents six years ago. It comes as the UK housing market enjoyed a boom fuelled by working from home relocations and the stamp duty holiday, with prices up around 10% over the last year. The firm, which is 60% owned by agents, made a pretax profit of £1.1m in the year to 31 January compared with a loss of £11.7m the year before. Its revenues rose by 22% to £23m, helped by higher revenues from new home developments listed on the website. It advertises both lettings and sales, and counts 10 big housebuilders among its clients, including Crest Nicholson and Barratt, as well as thousands of estate agents. While we were away...my colleague Rob Davies wrote about BAT’s surge in sales of alternatives to cigarettes: British American Tobacco recruited 1.4 million new users of vapes, heated tobacco and nicotine pouches in the first quarter, as it seeks to make cigarette alternatives profitable by 2025. Shares in the London-headquartered tobacco company gained more than 2% in early stock market trading, after it reported a strong performance in both cigarettes and “non-combustible” products such as Vype, its flagship vapour brand. BAT has set a target of 50 million users of non-cigarette products by 2025, as it aims to burnish its credentials as a modern tobacco company promoting so-called “reduced risk” choices for nicotine users. The company said growth in cigarette alternatives had accelerated. But sales will have to continue picking up pace if BAT is to achieve its goal, after the 1.4 million increase took it to 14.9 million, less than a third of the target. Britain’s cabinet office is urgently investigating the internet outage which affected the government’s website today, Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s spokesman said on Tuesday (Reuters reports). The spokesman said: “It appears to be a wider issue, a global issue, affecting a number of non-government sites, and as you would expect Cabinet Office are investigating it as a matter of urgency,” Fortunately, Gov.uk site seem to be back online now. Fastly, the content delivery firm at the heart of the global web outages, has tweeted that it’s disabled the ‘service configuration’ responsible for this huge disruption. Its global network is now ‘coming back online’, Fastly adds. In the meantime, the UK’s Attorney General advised emailing the department if you can’t get through on Gov.uk (It seems to be working now...) A massive internet outage, affecting websites including the Guardian, the UK government’s website Gov.uk, Amazon, and Reddit has been traced to a failure in a content delivery network (CDN) run by Fastly. The outage, which began around 11am UK time, saw visitors to a vast array of sites receive error messages including, “Error 503 service unavailable” and a terse “connection failure”. As well as bringing down some websites entirely, the failure also broke specific sections of other services, such as the servers for Twitter that host the social network’s emojis. Fastly, a cloud computing services provider, was believed to be the cause of the problem. The company runs an “edge cloud”, which is designed to speed up loading times for websites, protect them from denial-of-service attacks, and help them deal with bursts of traffic. A massive internet outage has hit social media, government and news websites today -- including The Guardian (but if you’re reading this, we’re back...) Major sites including Amazon, Reddit and Twitch were affected, along with parts of the BBC and a host of other media outlets including the New York Times, CNN and Bloomberg News The UK government website - gov.uk - has also been hit. The outage is being linked to a problem at US cloud service company Fastly, whose content delivery network is widely used to help websites run faster and provide security. Our technology editor Alex Hern has been tweeting what we know: Reuters’ has details too: Fastly said it was investigating “the potential impact to performance with our CDN services,” according to its website. Most of Fastly’s coverage areas were facing “Degraded Performance”, the website showed. Separately, Amazon.com Inc’s retail website also seemed to be down. Amazon was not immediately available to comment. Nearly 21,000 Reddit users reported issues with the social media platform, while more than 2,000 users reported problems with Amazon, according to outage monitoring website Downdetector.com. The eurozone’s recession was much shallower than feared. Statistics body Eurostat has revised up its estimate of GDP in the first quarter of 2021; now estimating the eurozone economy only shrank by 0.3% in January-March, not the 0.6% contraction first reported. It’s a welcome boost to Europe’s economy as it tried to pull away from the pandemic. Ireland (+7.8%) and Croatia (+5.8%) recorded the sharpest increases of GDP compared to the previous quarter, followed by Estonia (+4.8%) and Greece (+4.4%). The strongest declines were observed in Portugal (-3.3%) and Slovakia (-2.0%), followed by Germany (-1.8%) and Latvia (-1.7%) Sophie Griffiths, market analyst at OANDA, says it’s a significant upward revision: After a better-than-expected first quarter, combined with easing pandemic restrictions, improving vaccine numbers, and an upbeat outlook for the coming months, there is a good chance that European bourses could continue pressing higher to fresh record levels. UK banks will for the first time be forced to reveal their exposure to the climate crisis, highlighting the risks that rising temperatures and sea levels could pose for the financial system, as part of the Bank of England’s climate stress tests this year. The stress tests will put 19 banks and insurers through three climate scenarios, according to an update released Tuesday, including one where governments fail to take further steps to curb greenhouse gas emissions, resulting in average temperature increases of 3.3C and a 3.9m rise in sea levels. The central bank will be monitoring how those scenarios could impact potential loan losses, as customers default due to slowing growth and economic uncertainty. However, the Bank of England will not identify individual businesses through the tests and will release only aggregate results for the banking and insurance sector, which will be published in May 2022. The tests will look ahead 30 years. But the central bank also confirmed that the information will not be used to set capital requirements, which determine the kind of financial cushion that banks need in order to protect them from risky loans and products on their balance sheets. Instead, the exercise is meant to improve the way banks and insurers manage risks, and prompt a strategic review of their operations in light of the climate threat. Here’s the full story: Positive Money senior economist David Barmes is disappointed the BoE isn’t going further, though: “It is concerning that the Bank of England appears to be ruling out using climate stress tests to help inform changes to capital requirements. Climate capital rules that reflect the high risk of fossil fuel investments are a necessary inevitability to ensure financial stability and alignment with the government’s climate plans, and the Bank needs to be introducing such policies without delay. “By delaying the implementation of climate capital rules, the Bank is undermining its duty to protect financial stability and support net-zero.” Investor sentiment in Germany has fallen, but hopes of a strong economic recovery this year are still on track. That’s according to the ZEW Economic Research institute. Its poll of investors’ economic sentiment has fallen to 79.8 points this month, from 84.4 in the previous month, and lower than expected But.. the survey also shows that the economy is improving; ZEW’s gauge of current conditions jumped sharply to -9.1 points from -40.1 the previous month. ZEW President Achim Wambach said in a statement. “The economic recovery is progressing,” “The decline in expectations is probably largely due to the considerably better assessment of the economic situation, which is now back at pre-crisis levels.” The City of London’s last “open outcry” trading floor is to reopen, after opposition to plans to move to all-electronic trading. The London Metal Exchange has announced that, following a consultation, the Ring will reopen for physical trading on 6th September. The move means that metal traders can look forward to returning to their red leather benches, and setting the world’s daily benchmark prices for industrial metals such as copper, aluminium and zinc by shouting buy and sell orders at each other. The Ring has been temporarily closed since the first wave of the pandemic. And back in January, the LME proposed going digital - closing one of the last remaining in-person trading sites at major financial centres. That provoked a backlash from some brokers, who insisted that physical trading was the best way to organize price discovery (while sticking to a strict dress code, keeping one’s hair presentable, not chewing gum, and never leaving one’s seat!) LME users were split on the issue, with smaller traders favouring prices being discovered in the Ring, and larger ones pushing for electronic trading. So in a delicate compromise, this outcry trading will only set lunchtime Official Prices. Closing prices will be decided electronically (as they have been since March 2020). Matthew Chamberlain, LME CEO, explains: The divergent views in response to the Discussion Paper were particularly apparent between traditional participants and some smaller physical clients on the one hand, and our larger merchant trader and financial participants on the other. However, respondents were constructive in proposing approaches to reconcile these differences, respecting the differing needs of the LME community, and preserving the unique and mutually beneficial blend of physical and financial market liquidity, which makes our market so special. Global stock markets hit a fresh record high overnight too, with the MSCI All-Country World Index touching a new peak. Investors are waiting for key events and data releases this week, such as inflation data from China (Wednesday), the next US inflation report (Thursday), and the European Central Bank’s monetary policy meeting (Thursday). They’ll all be examined for signs that the recovery is on track, and hints of when central bankers might start to tighten their stimulus packages. Ray Attrill, head of FX Strategy at National Australia Bank, says: The start of a new week has not seen much by way of price action across all asset classes. “It’s hard to avoid the sense the global markets are for the most part now simply lurching from one big event risk to the next with not a lot to see in-between. It’s another quiet day in Europe’s stock markets, as investors take a breather after some lively sessions this year. The pan-European Stoxx 600 snuck up to a new record high this morning, up 0.2% to 454.52, suggesting confidence in the recovery remains strong. However, Germany’s DAX is slightly lower, following this morning’s surprise drop in industrial output. Manufacturers such as HeidelbergCement (-2.6%), materials group Covestra (-1.3%), and carmakers Volkswagen (-1.5%) and Daimler (-1.2%) as leading the fallers. On April’s factory slowdown, Teeuwe Mevissen, senior market economist at Rabobank, says: “I think it says more about the supply constraints. The big question is how long will these remain,” “Markets are in a wait-and-see mode. Valuations are high, and they need new catalysts to justify further buying.” Back on Germany....Capital Economics’ Andrew Kenningham says its factory slowdown means the economy was under par in April. But he’s still hopeful that Germany return to growth in the current quarter, having shrunk in January-March. He writes: The decline in German industrial production in April underlines that the German economy was performing well below normal at the start of the second quarter. But things should have improved since then, so we still expect GDP to rebound after its sharp decline in Q1. British American Tobacco (+1.6%) are also in the risers, after raising revenue forecasts on the back of higher demand for ‘non-tobacco’ products (such as vaping kits and nicotine pouches). BAT now expects revenue growth guidance of above 5% for 2021, as it pushes these ‘new category’ products such as Vuse, Velo and Glo. Jack Bowles, chief executive, said BAT had a “record quarter for consumer acquisition”. “We added +1.4 million non-combustible product consumers in Q1, to reach a total of 14.9 million. “We are growing New Categories at pace, encouraging more smokers to switch to scientifically substantiated reduced-risk alternatives.” Back in February, my colleagues Rob Davies and Matthew Chapman reported how BAT had launched a £1bn campaign using social media and popular influencers to promote its e-cigarettes, vapes and pouches. They explained: Critics say that such viral videos, even if they aren’t paid-for adverts, are the consequence of a global marketing push designed to offset dwindling cigarette consumption by recruiting the nicotine consumers of the future. BAT has embarked on a £1bn campaign that harnesses the popular appeal of social media influencers, pop stars and sporting events. According to a wide-ranging report by The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, it has also attracted younger adults, non-smokers and even reached the eyes of children. Shares in UK insurance firm Aviva have jumped 3.6%, after activist investor Cevian took a 5% stake - and started pressing for change. Cevian, Europe’s biggest activist investor, is pushing for Aviva to make deeper cost cuts, and return £5bn to investors following recent asset sales. Christer Gardell, Cevian’s co-founder, says: “Aviva has been poorly managed for many years, and its high-quality core businesses have been held back by high costs and a series of bad strategic decisions.” Shares in Aviva have gained 14.7p to 425p this morning, their highest since January 2020, just before the pandemic. Aviva has been selling off international assets since CEO Amanda Blanc took the helm last summer, and pledged to focus on larger businesses in the UK, Ireland and Canada. But Cevian argues that Aviva’s share price could climb to more than £8 within three years, if it returned excess capital to shareholders through dividends or buybacks. The FT has more details... Aviva has promised substantial returns and cost reductions as central planks of its strategy shift under Blanc, who has told investors that her mantra is to move quickly. However, Cevian wants a specific return of £5bn in dividends or buybacks of capital that the insurer has in excess of regulatory requirements The activist fund also believes that the cost-cutting can go further, calling for reductions of more than £500m from Aviva’s annual cost base by 2023, compared with the management’s target of £300m. It is also pushing for a leaner management structure, according to a person familiar with the matter. In London, stocks have opened a little higher, with the FTSE 100 up 15 points or 0.2% to 7092 points. Asset manager Intermediate Capital Group are the top riser, surging 6.7%, after reporting record profits, and a 19% jump in third-party assets under management amid the recovery in markets over the last year. But oil producer Royal Dutch Shell are down 1.3%, following a drop in the oil price this morning, while steelmaker Evraz is down 1.5%. Brent crude has dipped 0.5% to $71 per barrel, after China’s crude oil imports dropped by almost 15% in May - suggesting weaker demand. Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizhuo Securities, said: “Chinese oil imports at a five-month low ... would tend to confirm weakness in the Asia market.” On a brighter note, Japan’s economy shrank by less than first feared in the January-March quarter. Q1 GDP was revised up today, to show an annualised contraction of 3.9% (so almost 1% smaller on a quarterly basis). That’s up from a preliminary reading of a 5.1% contraction (or -1.3% q/q). Government spending and corporate investment fell less than first estimated, although household spending fell slightly more. Although the upgrade is welcome, it still leaves Japan half-way into recession, and breaks its recovery in the second half of 2020. A lack of semiconductors, timber and other intermediate goods weighed on German industrial output, says Reuters: The weaker than expected industrial figures suggest that the German economy will have to rely on household spending to support a still-fragile recovery from the coronavirus crisis. “Such a combination is unparalleled: Order books in industry are well filled and production is falling,” VP Bank economist Thomas Gitzel said, adding that the supply problems with semiconductors were pushing down output in the car industry. So despite well-filled order books, manufacturing will only make a limited contribution to overall economic growth in the second quarter, Gitzel said. The week-long blockage of the Suez Canal by the Ever Given in March contributed to the supply chain problems hitting German firms in April, suggests Carsten Brzeski of ING. He writes that April’s disappointing drop in industrial production suggests the rebound of the German economy in Q2 has ‘started with shaky knees’: The disappointing start to the second quarter suggests that supply chain disruptions, like the blockage of the Suez Canal in April or the ongoing semiconductor delivery problems, have not left German industry unscathed. However despite today’s disappointment, the industrial outlook remains bright. Brzeski adds that capacity issues and the lack of qualified workers could soon return as the most pressing hurdles to growth, as lack of demand isn’t a problem. Destatis also reports that German construction output fell by 4.3% in April -- suggesting that shortages of building materials might be weighing on the sector. Energy production jumped by 6.0%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Output at German factories has fallen unexpectedly, as supply chain bottlenecks and shortages of key parts and materials such as computer chips threaten to undermine the recovery. German industrial production fell by 1.0% in April, the Federal Statistics Office reports this morning. That’s shy of forecasts of a 0.5% rise, as Europe’s largest economy looked to recover from its contraction earlier this year. Production of consumer goods slumped by 3.3% - even though some households are expected to be spending heavily this summer as lockdowns restriction are lifted. Production of intermediate goods (items used in final products) fell 0.2%, while production of heavy duty capital goods decreased by 0.1%. March’s growth was revised down too, from +2.5% to +2.2%. It means production at German factories is still 5.6% below its pre-pandemic levels, despite the pick-up in the global economy this year. Factory bosses have been warning of shortages of semiconductors, plastics, rubber and metals, with suppliers hiking prices in response. These shortfalls are threatening to undermine the recovery from last year’s economic slump, and are also pushing prices higher as firms try to recoup their costs. Yesterday we learned that German factory orders fell in April, indicating that the problems may last for some time. Semiconductor shortages are a particular problem, which has already hit car production this year. Those shortages are expected to run into next year, as ramping up chip fabrication plants takes time. Tesla is reportedly considering buying its own chip plant, to guarantee supplies. Bosch, Europe’s largest auto supplier, says car manufacturers must put “money on the table” and make a “rock solid” commitment to orders, Bosch board member Harald Krüger told the Financial Times. “The only way to get out of [the recent crisis] is to have a different level of commitment” Bosch opened a €1bn semiconductor plant in Dresden yesterday, to produce chips for its power tools in July, before beginning production on automotive chips in September. That might help to ease the chip shortage, though as Krüger says.... “Money needs to be put on the table and actually parts have to be bought. “The commitment needs to be rock solid that those parts will be bought. It can’t be: ‘Maybe I [will] buy them, prepare for it, and maybe not.’ This doesn’t work.” More here: Carmakers must ‘put money on table’ to avoid repeat of chip crisis The agenda 8.30am BST: Bank of

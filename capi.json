Let’s learn a little more about the two players involved.</p> <p><strong>Tamara Zidansek</strong> is the world No 85, and the true outsider of the four. The Slovenian had never been past the second round at a slam before this run, which began with a first-round comeback win over the No 6 seed, Bianca Andreescu. Zidansek has played in and lost two WTA Tour finals, both on clay, most recently in Colombia last month.</p> <p>Her opponent, <strong>Paula Badosa</strong>, was promoted to No 33 seed when Alison Riske withdrew. The former junior French Open champion is a rising star on clay, beating Sloane Stephens and Jelena Ostapenko on a run to the fourth round here in 2020. While her path to the quarters was eased by Naomi Osaka’s withdrawal, the Spaniard still had to overcome former finalist Marketa Vondrousova to reach the last eight.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60be94538f0837b8708e089f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-08T09:38:08.183Z\">10.38am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The quarter-finals begin at Roland Garros and while the biggest names feature later today or tomorrow, we start with a fascinating four-way battle to reach new heights. In the bottom half of the women’s draw, four players remain: Slovenia’s Tamara Zidansek, Spain’s Paula Badosa, Kazakhstan’s Elena Rybakina and her Russian doubles partner, Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. </p> <p>Of the quartet, only Pavlyuchenkova has reached a grand slam quarter-final before, and now one of them will be in the final on Saturday. Experience arguably makes Pavlyuchenkova the favourite but in truth, all four women will fancy their chances. Zidansek and Badosa are first up on Court Philippe-Chatrier.</p> <p>Later on, Alexander Zverev looks to continue his impressive form against the only man outside the top 10 seeds to reach the quarters: Spanish youngster Alejandro Davidovich Fokina. In the evening session Stefanos Tsitsipas takes on Daniil Medvedev, the No 2 seed who had never won a match here before this year.</p> </div>   </div>","wordcount":"2541","firstPublicationDate":"2021-06-08T09:40:59Z","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2021-06-08T12:39:21Z","liveBloggingNow":"true","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/p/hyg7v","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf6b1145839ca631d0ecf6fe6da31ab9677435a9/0_147_2687_1612/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","isLive":"true","bodyText":"Tamara Zidansek speaks: “I was struggling a little bit [at the end of the second] but in the third set I managed to get my groove, and I was fighting really well.” Is she going to watch the next match? “A little bit ... I have some recovery to do, but I’ll keep an eye on it.” A terrific victory for the world No 85, who looks to have the game to climb much higher in the rankings. It’s Badosa’s turn to feel the tension now, and she sends a couple of tight forehands drifting beyond the lines. Suddenly, Zidansek has two match points. She misses a chance with the first, but senses Badosa is cracking, and powers a winner into the corner. She’s done it! What a ridiculous match this has been. For quality, drama and tension, it’s been better than plenty of grand slam finals. Third set: Zidansek 7-5, 4-6, 7-6 Badosa* (*denotes next server) Dogged defensive work from Zidansek this time, but she overcooks a sliced backhand and is under pressure at 15-30. Ack, the first serve is a mile off, and a double fault follows. Two break points ... the first saved with a ridiculous forehand smash down the line. And she does it again! Deuce ... and another double fault. She gets a lucky break, a forehand skidding off the service line. Another huge forehand winner, then a solid return from Badosa, and we are back to deuce. Badosa makes a mess of her cross-court return, but Zidansek nets that trusty drop shot. A seven-minute game now. Zidansek finds another long-range forehand winner and gets the better of the next rally, smashing the ball away to somehow hold serve! Third set: *Zidansek 7-5, 4-6, 6-6 Badosa (*denotes next server) Badosa opens with a zipping cross-court winner, then a double fault. A big serve and a flat volley into the corner gets her out of trouble. We’ve had 14 breaks of serve in this match, but none in the last eight games. Third set: Zidansek 7-5, 4-6, 6-5 Badosa* (*denotes next server) Badosa has found more consistency, cutting out the errors and making Zidansek win a lot more points. The Slovenian wins a key, 17-shot rally at 15-15 and closes out. Her resistance is getting to Badosa, who launches her racket towards her chair as a return flies wide. Third set: *Zidansek 7-5, 4-6, 5-5 Badosa (*denotes next server) No tie-breaks here; the first player to get two games ahead will win the match. Zidansek has the first chance but Badosa doesn’t give her a look in, going on the attack and powering to 40-0. A big first serve out wide seals a hold to love, and the pressure is back on her opponent. Third set: Zidansek 7-5, 4-6, 5-4 Badosa* (*denotes next server) Two hours on court, and these two still can’t be separated. Zidansek chooses the perfect time to land her first ace, and gets a comfortable hold with a trademark forehand winner. Third set: *Zidansek 7-5, 4-6, 4-4 Badosa (*denotes next server) Those last two points from Zidansek showed terrific touch, and she demonstrates it again here with a drop shot Badosa doesn’t bother chasing. Badosa’s turn to feel the nerves, and an eighth double fault follows – but a well-worked point gets her back to 30-all. At game point, she goes for her trusty double-handed backhand down the line – and misses. Badosa is doing just about enough on serve, though, and secures the hold with a deep slice that Zidansek floats back beyond the baseline. Third set: Zidansek 7-5, 4-6, 4-3 Badosa* (*denotes next server) The volume is rising from both players as we edge towards the two-hour mark. Badosa is finding the pace and power that eluded her early on, absolutely burying a winner at 30-15 down. Zidansek pounces on a net cord, finding the line with her forehand, and then brings out that tricky drop-volley again to edge back ahead. Third set: *Zidansek 7-5, 4-6, 3-3 Badosa (*denotes next server) From 2-0 up to 3-2 down, the pressure is now back on Badosa. She shakes it off, completing the hold with a cross-court volley and a triumphant, tension-relieving roar. Third set: Zidansek 7-5, 4-6, 3-2 Badosa* (*denotes next server) With Badosa wobbling on serve again and Zidansek rediscovering her accuracy, this feels very finely poised now. There are a lot more short points as the errors creep in, and Zidansek gets a welcome hold as Badosa’s return up the line drifts wide. Third set: *Zidansek 7-5, 4-6, 2-2 Badosa (*denotes next server) It’s crucial for Zidansek to keep in touch, because Badosa has already shown nerves on serve. Badosa starts well – a deft, sliding volley setting up 30-0 – but a delicate, cross-court drop shot from Zidansek changes the game. At break point, Badosa lands a risky backhand winner down the line, but Zidansek pulls out that drop shot again, and breaks back. That’s the 14th break of this match! Third set: Zidansek 7-5, 4-6, 1-2 Badosa* (*denotes next server) From 7-5, 4-2 up, Zidansek has lost six games on the spin, and badly needs to stop that run here. A crafty, angled drop shot turns the game her way at 15-30, and she gets the job done on second serve, Badosa’s return landing well wide. Third set: *Zidansek 7-5, 4-6, 0-2 Badosa (*denotes next server) Ramos gives Zidansek an informal warning over getting coaching from her team up in the stands. Badosa dishes up another double-fault, but rallies with a ferocious winner down the line. Zidansek has the chance to take it to deuce, but sends her volley a mile wide. She would have nailed that in the first two sets. Third set: Zidansek 7-5, 4-6, 0-1 Badosa* (*denotes next server) Here we go, then: the deciding set. Zidansek serves first and moves to 30-0 easily enough – but then Badosa strikes back, stepping forward to turn the game around and earn a break point. She takes it as Zidansek beams a forehand well wide. Second set: *Zidansek 7-5, 4-6 Badosa (*denotes next server) The change in body language is stark; Badosa is now bouncing around the court, with Zidansek looking deflated as she sends a hopeful backhand wide. Set point for Badosa, won with a whipped forehand that Zidansek can’t return. Second set: Zidansek 7-5, 4-5 Badosa* (*denotes next server) Zidansek has the weight of the world on her shoulders, and double-faults for the first time to go 0-30 behind. She tries to change it up with a drop shot, but it’s always falling short, and a wild forehand completes an almost zero-effort break for Badosa, who will now serve to level the match. Second set: *Zidansek 7-5, 4-4 Badosa (*denotes next server) At this point, both players would probably rather not be serving – and Badosa quickly slips 0-30 down. Some overly defensive play from Zidansek allows Badosa to bounce back, however, and a big first serve seals the hold. Second set: Zidansek 7-5, 4-3 Badosa* (*denotes next server) Tamara Zidansek is two games away now, but her struggles continue on first serve and some aggressive baseline play gets Badosa two break-back points. On second serve, Badosa’s deep return proves enough to earn another break – the fourth in a row. Second set: *Zidansek 7-5, 4-2 Badosa (*denotes next server) When Badosa has her opponent on the back foot, self-doubt seems to creep in. A wonky forehand is followed by a double fault, then a weak second serve which is ruthlessly put away by Zidansek. Three break points, and a break quickly gifted by Badosa, who is running out of games. Second set: Zidansek 7-5, 3-2 Badosa* (*denotes next server) Badosa senses a chance at 15-30, on Zidansek’s second serve. She pounds a return through her opponent, and seals the break as Zidansek, feeling the pressure, mishits. Back on serve in the second set! Second set: *Zidansek 7-5, 3-1 Badosa (*denotes next server) Paula Badosa has enjoyed a really impressive clay-court season, beating Ash Barty in Charleston, reaching the semi-finals in Madrid and then winning in Belgrade. It’s all in danger of ending with a whimper here, the fourth double-fault a lowlight as she hands over three break points. She saves the first, but a forehand down the line is just wide, and Zidansek is now in charge of this match. Second set: Zidansek 7-5, 2-1 Badosa* (*denotes next server) Zidansek holds to 15, sealed with another forehand winner, struck from a lofty angle deep into the far corner. Second set: *Zidansek 7-5, 1-1 Badosa (*denotes next server) A big game for Badosa, who has lost three games in a row and still seems distracted by the umpire’s call that started the run. She stops the losing run here, and we stay on serve. Second set: Zidansek 7-5, 1-0 Badosa* (*denotes next server) Zidansek was the better player in that first set, and continues to push Badosa around the court, securing the hold by stepping in behind her serve and wrongfooting her opponent. If you’re just joining us (I’ve always wanted to say that ...) it’s been a cracking match so far, with Zidansek bouncing back brilliantly after going a double-break down. Badosa has not quite found top gear but it’s been high-quality stuff, short on the nerves and unforced errors you might expect from two players in their first slam quarter-final. First set: *Zidansek 7-5 Badosa (*denotes next server) Badosa powers to 30-love, only for Zidansek to hit back with a looping forehand return. That punchy, precise forehand gets her to 30-all, and then a set point as Badosa fails to chase her down. Badosa saves the first but presents another when an awkward overhead effort goes wide. This time, Zidansek takes it when her opponent nets! First set: Zidansek 6-5 Badosa* (*denotes next server) Second serve is a weak spot for both players, and Badosa is all over it here, creaming it back down the line. Stepping off the baseline, she has a routine volley – but shanks it long! She shakes it off, winning a scrappy rally to set up deuce. Badosa thinks she’s found the line with a passing shot, and lets out a yell – only for the umpire to overturn the call. Zidansek secures the hold with a lovely long-range drop shot. First set: *Zidansek 5-5 Badosa (*denotes next server) Badosa is under pressure at 15-30 down but Zidansek gifts her a point with an unforced error. From there, an almighty heave into the corner and a low, skidding volley get Badosa over the line. First set: Zidansek 5-4 Badosa* (*denotes next server) Zidansek quickly moves to 40-15, but an unstoppable cross-court backhand gets Badosa back in the game. A rare unforced error takes us to deuce, where we are treated to the match’s best rally so far – won by Zidansek with a double-handed, cross-court backhand that clips the line! Zidansek leads for the first time. First set: *Zidansek 4-4 Badosa (*denotes next server) New balls on the Badosa serve, and Zidansek fires her seventh forehand winner. Badosa digs in, applying plenty of side spin to her first serve, but Zidansek secures the break with a couple of zipping volleys that her opponent can’t handle. It’s the sixth break of serve in eight games! First set: Zidansek 3-4 Badosa* (*denotes next server) Badosa turns up the pace and carves out another break point, which she takes with a crunching forehand that Zidansek can’t retrieve. This isn’t the freestyle poetry, by the way. Or is it? First set: *Zidansek 3-3 Badosa (*denotes next server) Not any more! Quite a remarkable change of momentum in this first set; Badosa has lost her rhythm while Zidansek is timing her shots perfectly. She breaks back again, and we are back on serve. First set: Zidansek 2-3 Badosa* (*denotes next server) Zidansek gets her first service hold, largely steering clear of Badosa’s fearsome forehand and stepping in behind her serve. She’s fought her way back into this, but Badosa still has a break. First set: *Zidansek 1-3 Badosa (*denotes next server) She’s finding it tough on her own serve, so Zidansek senses the need to get after her opponent. An aggressive return game pays off, bringing up three break points, and she only needs one as Badosa goes long. First set: Zidansek 0-3 Badosa* (*denotes next server) Zidansek can’t really match Badosa for pace early on, so has to find a different approach, mixing up her angles nicely. The pressure tells at deuce, Zidansek netting a forehand and then getting quickly overpowered in a rally. It’s been a flying start from Paula Badosa. First set: *Zidansek 0-2 Badosa (*denotes next server) Badosa has started really well here, cruising through her first service game and looking much more comfortable than her opponent. Early days, though. First set: Zidansek 0-1 Badosa* (*denotes next server) Zidansek makes a nervy start on serve and presents Badosa with an early break point. She doesn’t take the first chance but a firm forehand sets up another, taken with a backhand down the line. The players are out and warming up on a sunny Court Philippe-Chatrier. Carlos Ramos is the umpire; you might remember him from the 2018 US Open final. In other news, it appears that due to some pretty widespread technical problems, you’re probably not able to read this blog just now. At last, a chance to try out some of my freestyle poetry ... The first women’s quarter-final gets under way shortly. Let’s learn a little more about the two players involved. Tamara Zidansek is the world No 85, and the true outsider of the four. The Slovenian had never been past the second round at a slam before this run, which began with a first-round comeback win over the No 6 seed, Bianca Andreescu. Zidansek has played in and lost two WTA Tour finals, both on clay, most recently in Colombia last month. Her opponent, Paula Badosa, was promoted to No 33 seed when Alison Riske withdrew. The former junior French Open champion is a rising star on clay, beating Sloane Stephens and Jelena Ostapenko on a run to the fourth round here in 2020. While her path to the quarters was eased by Naomi Osaka’s withdrawal, the Spaniard still had to overcome former finalist Marketa Vondrousova to reach the last eight. The quarter-finals begin at Roland Garros and while the biggest names feature later today or tomorrow, we start with a fascinating four-way battle to reach new heights. In the bottom half of the women’s draw, four players remain: Slovenia’s Tamara Zidansek, Spain’s Paula Badosa, Kazakhstan’s Elena Rybakina and her Russian doubles partner, Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. Of the quartet, only Pavlyuchenkova has reached a grand slam quarter-final before, and now one of them will be in the final on Saturday. Experience arguably makes Pavlyuchenkova the favourite but in truth, all four women will fancy their chances. Zidansek and Badosa are first up on Court Philippe-Chatrier. Later on, Alexander Zverev looks to continue his impressive form against the only man outside the top 10 seeds to reach the quarters: Spanish youngster Alejandro Davidovich Fokina. In the evening session Stefanos Tsitsipas takes on Daniil Medvedev, the No 2 seed who had never won a match here before this year.","charCount":"14788","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/niall-mcveigh\">Niall McVeigh</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/live/2021/jun/08/german-factory-output-bitcoin-hackers-ftse-markets-eurozone-gdp-unemployment-us-job-vacancies-climate-banks-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-08T12:33:44Z","webTitle":"German factory output falls;

The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) Optimism Index has dipped by 0.2 points to a reading of 99.6 in May, ending a three-month run of increases. NFIB chief economist Bill Dunkelberg said in a statement that labor shortages and rising prices were worrying small business owners. “If small business owners could hire more workers to take care of customers, sales would be higher and getting closer to pre-COVID levels” “In addition, inflation on Main Street is rampant and small business owners are uncertain about future business conditions.” A net 27% of businesses said they planned to create new jobs in the next three months, up 6 points from April and a record high. More companies warned that jobs were hard to fill (vacancies have been running at record levels, with a new JOLTS report due later today). Economist Aaron Sojourner says the solution to the hiring problems is clear -- raise wages. The property website OnTheMarket has reported its first annual profit since being launched by a group of estate agents six years ago. It comes as the UK housing market enjoyed a boom fuelled by working from home relocations and the stamp duty holiday, with prices up around 10% over the last year. The firm, which is 60% owned by agents, made a pretax profit of £1.1m in the year to 31 January compared with a loss of £11.7m the year before. Its revenues rose by 22% to £23m, helped by higher revenues from new home developments listed on the website. It advertises both lettings and sales, and counts 10 big housebuilders among its clients, including Crest Nicholson and Barratt, as well as thousands of estate agents. While we were away...my colleague Rob Davies wrote about BAT’s surge in sales of alternatives to cigarettes: British American Tobacco recruited 1.4 million new users of vapes, heated tobacco and nicotine pouches in the first quarter, as it seeks to make cigarette alternatives profitable by 2025. Shares in the London-headquartered tobacco company gained more than 2% in early stock market trading, after it reported a strong performance in both cigarettes and “non-combustible” products such as Vype, its flagship vapour brand. BAT has set a target of 50 million users of non-cigarette products by 2025, as it aims to burnish its credentials as a modern tobacco company promoting so-called “reduced risk” choices for nicotine users. The company said growth in cigarette alternatives had accelerated. But sales will have to continue picking up pace if BAT is to achieve its goal, after the 1.4 million increase took it to 14.9 million, less than a third of the target. Britain’s cabinet office is urgently investigating the internet outage which affected the government’s website today, Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s spokesman said on Tuesday (Reuters reports). The spokesman said: “It appears to be a wider issue, a global issue, affecting a number of non-government sites, and as you would expect Cabinet Office are investigating it as a matter of urgency,” Fortunately, Gov.uk site seem to be back online now. Fastly, the content delivery firm at the heart of the global web outages, has tweeted that it’s disabled the ‘service configuration’ responsible for this huge disruption. Its global network is now ‘coming back online’, Fastly adds. In the meantime, the UK’s Attorney General advised emailing the department if you can’t get through on Gov.uk (It seems to be working now...) A massive internet outage, affecting websites including the Guardian, the UK government’s website Gov.uk, Amazon, and Reddit has been traced to a failure in a content delivery network (CDN) run by Fastly. The outage, which began around 11am UK time, saw visitors to a vast array of sites receive error messages including, “Error 503 service unavailable” and a terse “connection failure”. As well as bringing down some websites entirely, the failure also broke specific sections of other services, such as the servers for Twitter that host the social network’s emojis. Fastly, a cloud computing services provider, was believed to be the cause of the problem. The company runs an “edge cloud”, which is designed to speed up loading times for websites, protect them from denial-of-service attacks, and help them deal with bursts of traffic. A massive internet outage has hit social media, government and news websites today -- including The Guardian (but if you’re reading this, we’re back...) Major sites including Amazon, Reddit and Twitch were affected, along with parts of the BBC and a host of other media outlets including the New York Times, CNN and Bloomberg News The UK government website - gov.uk - has also been hit. The outage is being linked to a problem at US cloud service company Fastly, whose content delivery network is widely used to help websites run faster and provide security. Our technology editor Alex Hern has been tweeting what we know: Reuters’ has details too: Fastly said it was investigating “the potential impact to performance with our CDN services,” according to its website. Most of Fastly’s coverage areas were facing “Degraded Performance”, the website showed. Separately, Amazon.com Inc’s retail website also seemed to be down. Amazon was not immediately available to comment. Nearly 21,000 Reddit users reported issues with the social media platform, while more than 2,000 users reported problems with Amazon, according to outage monitoring website Downdetector.com. The eurozone’s recession was much shallower than feared. Statistics body Eurostat has revised up its estimate of GDP in the first quarter of 2021; now estimating the eurozone economy only shrank by 0.3% in January-March, not the 0.6% contraction first reported. It’s a welcome boost to Europe’s economy as it tried to pull away from the pandemic. Ireland (+7.8%) and Croatia (+5.8%) recorded the sharpest increases of GDP compared to the previous quarter, followed by Estonia (+4.8%) and Greece (+4.4%). The strongest declines were observed in Portugal (-3.3%) and Slovakia (-2.0%), followed by Germany (-1.8%) and Latvia (-1.7%) Sophie Griffiths, market analyst at OANDA, says it’s a significant upward revision: After a better-than-expected first quarter, combined with easing pandemic restrictions, improving vaccine numbers, and an upbeat outlook for the coming months, there is a good chance that European bourses could continue pressing higher to fresh record levels. UK banks will for the first time be forced to reveal their exposure to the climate crisis, highlighting the risks that rising temperatures and sea levels could pose for the financial system, as part of the Bank of England’s climate stress tests this year. The stress tests will put 19 banks and insurers through three climate scenarios, according to an update released Tuesday, including one where governments fail to take further steps to curb greenhouse gas emissions, resulting in average temperature increases of 3.3C and a 3.9m rise in sea levels. The central bank will be monitoring how those scenarios could impact potential loan losses, as customers default due to slowing growth and economic uncertainty. However, the Bank of England will not identify individual businesses through the tests and will release only aggregate results for the banking and insurance sector, which will be published in May 2022. The tests will look ahead 30 years. But the central bank also confirmed that the information will not be used to set capital requirements, which determine the kind of financial cushion that banks need in order to protect them from risky loans and products on their balance sheets. Instead, the exercise is meant to improve the way banks and insurers manage risks, and prompt a strategic review of their operations in light of the climate threat. Here’s the full story: Positive Money senior economist David Barmes is disappointed the BoE isn’t going further, though: “It is concerning that the Bank of England appears to be ruling out using climate stress tests to help inform changes to capital requirements. Climate capital rules that reflect the high risk of fossil fuel investments are a necessary inevitability to ensure financial stability and alignment with the government’s climate plans, and the Bank needs to be introducing such policies without delay. “By delaying the implementation of climate capital rules, the Bank is undermining its duty to protect financial stability and support net-zero.” Investor sentiment in Germany has fallen, but hopes of a strong economic recovery this year are still on track. That’s according to the ZEW Economic Research institute. Its poll of investors’ economic sentiment has fallen to 79.8 points this month, from 84.4 in the previous month, and lower than expected But.. the survey also shows that the economy is improving; ZEW’s gauge of current conditions jumped sharply to -9.1 points from -40.1 the previous month. ZEW President Achim Wambach said in a statement. “The economic recovery is progressing,” “The decline in expectations is probably largely due to the considerably better assessment of the economic situation, which is now back at pre-crisis levels.” The City of London’s last “open outcry” trading floor is to reopen, after opposition to plans to move to all-electronic trading. The London Metal Exchange has announced that, following a consultation, the Ring will reopen for physical trading on 6th September. The move means that metal traders can look forward to returning to their red leather benches, and setting the world’s daily benchmark prices for industrial metals such as copper, aluminium and zinc by shouting buy and sell orders at each other. The Ring has been temporarily closed since the first wave of the pandemic. And back in January, the LME proposed going digital - closing one of the last remaining in-person trading sites at major financial centres. That provoked a backlash from some brokers, who insisted that physical trading was the best way to organize price discovery (while sticking to a strict dress code, keeping one’s hair presentable, not chewing gum, and never leaving one’s seat!) LME users were split on the issue, with smaller traders favouring prices being discovered in the Ring, and larger ones pushing for electronic trading. So in a delicate compromise, this outcry trading will only set lunchtime Official Prices. Closing prices will be decided electronically (as they have been since March 2020). Matthew Chamberlain, LME CEO, explains: The divergent views in response to the Discussion Paper were particularly apparent between traditional participants and some smaller physical clients on the one hand, and our larger merchant trader and financial participants on the other. However, respondents were constructive in proposing approaches to reconcile these differences, respecting the differing needs of the LME community, and preserving the unique and mutually beneficial blend of physical and financial market liquidity, which makes our market so special. Global stock markets hit a fresh record high overnight too, with the MSCI All-Country World Index touching a new peak. Investors are waiting for key events and data releases this week, such as inflation data from China (Wednesday), the next US inflation report (Thursday), and the European Central Bank’s monetary policy meeting (Thursday). They’ll all be examined for signs that the recovery is on track, and hints of when central bankers might start to tighten their stimulus packages. Ray Attrill, head of FX Strategy at National Australia Bank, says: The start of a new week has not seen much by way of price action across all asset classes. “It’s hard to avoid the sense the global markets are for the most part now simply lurching from one big event risk to the next with not a lot to see in-between. It’s another quiet day in Europe’s stock markets, as investors take a breather after some lively sessions this year. The pan-European Stoxx 600 snuck up to a new record high this morning, up 0.2% to 454.52, suggesting confidence in the recovery remains strong. However, Germany’s DAX is slightly lower, following this morning’s surprise drop in industrial output. Manufacturers such as HeidelbergCement (-2.6%), materials group Covestra (-1.3%), and carmakers Volkswagen (-1.5%) and Daimler (-1.2%) as leading the fallers. On April’s factory slowdown, Teeuwe Mevissen, senior market economist at Rabobank, says: “I think it says more about the supply constraints. The big question is how long will these remain,” “Markets are in a wait-and-see mode. Valuations are high, and they need new catalysts to justify further buying.” Back on Germany....Capital Economics’ Andrew Kenningham says its factory slowdown means the economy was under par in April. But he’s still hopeful that Germany return to growth in the current quarter, having shrunk in January-March. He writes: The decline in German industrial production in April underlines that the German economy was performing well below normal at the start of the second quarter. But things should have improved since then, so we still expect GDP to rebound after its sharp decline in Q1. British American Tobacco (+1.6%) are also in the risers, after raising revenue forecasts on the back of higher demand for ‘non-tobacco’ products (such as vaping kits and nicotine pouches). BAT now expects revenue growth guidance of above 5% for 2021, as it pushes these ‘new category’ products such as Vuse, Velo and Glo. Jack Bowles, chief executive, said BAT had a “record quarter for consumer acquisition”. “We added +1.4 million non-combustible product consumers in Q1, to reach a total of 14.9 million. “We are growing New Categories at pace, encouraging more smokers to switch to scientifically substantiated reduced-risk alternatives.” Back in February, my colleagues Rob Davies and Matthew Chapman reported how BAT had launched a £1bn campaign using social media and popular influencers to promote its e-cigarettes, vapes and pouches. They explained: Critics say that such viral videos, even if they aren’t paid-for adverts, are the consequence of a global marketing push designed to offset dwindling cigarette consumption by recruiting the nicotine consumers of the future. BAT has embarked on a £1bn campaign that harnesses the popular appeal of social media influencers, pop stars and sporting events. According to a wide-ranging report by The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, it has also attracted younger adults, non-smokers and even reached the eyes of children. Shares in UK insurance firm Aviva have jumped 3.6%, after activist investor Cevian took a 5% stake - and started pressing for change. Cevian, Europe’s biggest activist investor, is pushing for Aviva to make deeper cost cuts, and return £5bn to investors following recent asset sales. Christer Gardell, Cevian’s co-founder, says: “Aviva has been poorly managed for many years, and its high-quality core businesses have been held back by high costs and a series of bad strategic decisions.” Shares in Aviva have gained 14.7p to 425p this morning, their highest since January 2020, just before the pandemic. Aviva has been selling off international assets since CEO Amanda Blanc took the helm last summer, and pledged to focus on larger businesses in the UK, Ireland and Canada. But Cevian argues that Aviva’s share price could climb to more than £8 within three years, if it returned excess capital to shareholders through dividends or buybacks. The FT has more details... Aviva has promised substantial returns and cost reductions as central planks of its strategy shift under Blanc, who has told investors that her mantra is to move quickly. However, Cevian wants a specific return of £5bn in dividends or buybacks of capital that the insurer has in excess of regulatory requirements The activist fund also believes that the cost-cutting can go further, calling for reductions of more than £500m from Aviva’s annual cost base by 2023, compared with the management’s target of £300m. It is also pushing for a leaner management structure, according to a person familiar with the matter. In London, stocks have opened a little higher, with the FTSE 100 up 15 points or 0.2% to 7092 points. Asset manager Intermediate Capital Group are the top riser, surging 6.7%, after reporting record profits, and a 19% jump in third-party assets under management amid the recovery in markets over the last year. But oil producer Royal Dutch Shell are down 1.3%, following a drop in the oil price this morning, while steelmaker Evraz is down 1.5%. Brent crude has dipped 0.5% to $71 per barrel, after China’s crude oil imports dropped by almost 15% in May - suggesting weaker demand. Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizhuo Securities, said: “Chinese oil imports at a five-month low ... would tend to confirm weakness in the Asia market.” On a brighter note, Japan’s economy shrank by less than first feared in the January-March quarter. Q1 GDP was revised up today, to show an annualised contraction of 3.9% (so almost 1% smaller on a quarterly basis). That’s up from a preliminary reading of a 5.1% contraction (or -1.3% q/q). Government spending and corporate investment fell less than first estimated, although household spending fell slightly more. Although the upgrade is welcome, it still leaves Japan half-way into recession, and breaks its recovery in the second half of 2020. A lack of semiconductors, timber and other intermediate goods weighed on German industrial output, says Reuters: The weaker than expected industrial figures suggest that the German economy will have to rely on household spending to support a still-fragile recovery from the coronavirus crisis. “Such a combination is unparalleled: Order books in industry are well filled and production is falling,” VP Bank economist Thomas Gitzel said, adding that the supply problems with semiconductors were pushing down output in the car industry. So despite well-filled order books, manufacturing will only make a limited contribution to overall economic growth in the second quarter, Gitzel said. The week-long blockage of the Suez Canal by the Ever Given in March contributed to the supply chain problems hitting German firms in April, suggests Carsten Brzeski of ING. He writes that April’s disappointing drop in industrial production suggests the rebound of the German economy in Q2 has ‘started with shaky knees’: The disappointing start to the second quarter suggests that supply chain disruptions, like the blockage of the Suez Canal in April or the ongoing semiconductor delivery problems, have not left German industry unscathed. However despite today’s disappointment, the industrial outlook remains bright. Brzeski adds that capacity issues and the lack of qualified workers could soon return as the most pressing hurdles to growth, as lack of demand isn’t a problem. Destatis also reports that German construction output fell by 4.3% in April -- suggesting that shortages of building materials might be weighing on the sector. Energy production jumped by 6.0%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Output at German factories has fallen unexpectedly, as supply chain bottlenecks and shortages of key parts and materials such as computer chips threaten to undermine the recovery. German industrial production fell by 1.0% in April, the Federal Statistics Office reports this morning. That’s shy of forecasts of a 0.5% rise, as Europe’s largest economy looked to recover from its contraction earlier this year. Production of consumer goods slumped by 3.3% - even though some households are expected to be spending heavily this summer as lockdowns restriction are lifted. Production of intermediate goods (items used in final products) fell 0.2%, while production of heavy duty capital goods decreased by 0.1%. March’s growth was revised down too, from +2.5% to +2.2%. It means production at German factories is still 5.6% below its pre-pandemic levels, despite the pick-up in the global economy this year. Factory bosses have been warning of shortages of semiconductors, plastics, rubber and metals, with suppliers hiking prices in response. These shortfalls are threatening to undermine the recovery from last year’s economic slump, and are also pushing prices higher as firms try to recoup their costs. Yesterday we learned that German factory orders fell in April, indicating that the problems may last for some time. Semiconductor shortages are a particular problem, which has already hit car production this year. Those shortages are expected to run into next year, as ramping up chip fabrication plants takes time. Tesla is reportedly considering buying its own chip plant, to guarantee supplies. Bosch, Europe’s largest auto supplier, says car manufacturers must put “money on the table” and make a “rock solid” commitment to orders, Bosch board member Harald Krüger told the Financial Times. “The only way to get out of [the recent crisis] is to have a different level of commitment” Bosch opened a €1bn semiconductor plant in Dresden yesterday, to produce chips for its power tools in July, before beginning production on automotive chips in September. That might help to ease the chip shortage, though as Krüger says.... “Money needs to be put on the table and actually parts have to be bought. “The commitment needs to be rock solid that those parts will be bought. It can’t be: ‘Maybe I [will] buy them, prepare for it, and maybe not.’ This doesn’t work.” More here: Carmakers must ‘put money on table’ to avoid repeat of chip crisis The agenda 8.30am BST: Bank of England to publish details of its 2021 climate change stress test 10am BST: ZEW index of German economic sentiment 10am BST: Eurozone Q1 GDP and employment figures (final estimate) 11am BST: US NFIB business optimism index 1.30pm BST: US trade balance for April 3pm BST: US JOLTS index of job openings","charCount":"22165","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/graemewearden\">Graeme Wearden</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2021/jun/08/cannes-joanna-hogg-and-clio-barnard-to-premiere-new-films-in-directors-fortnight","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-08T12:33:10Z","webTitle":"Cannes: Joanna Hogg and Clio Barnard to premiere new films in Directors’ Fortnight","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/jun/08/cannes-joanna-hogg-and-clio-barnard-to-premiere-new-films-in-directors-fortnight","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2021/jun/08/cannes-joanna-hogg-and-clio-barnard-to-premiere-new-films-in-directors-fortnight","fields":{"headline":"Cannes: Joanna Hogg and Clio Barnard to premiere new films in Directors’ Fortnight","standfirst":"<p>Twelve of the 24 film-makers featured in Directors’ Fortnight sidebar are women, compared to four of the 24 in main competition</p>","trailText":"Twelve of the 24 film-makers featured in Directors’ Fortnight sidebar are women, compared to four of the 24 in main competition","byline":"Andrew Pulver","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ab7e2eb4ead9745e62fc020ec9972978b200f42c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab7e2eb4ead9745e62fc020ec9972978b200f42c/0_231_4824_2894/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Honor Swinton Byrne and Tilda Swinton in The Souvenir, 2019.

That rather depends on your definition. No country will vaccinate every adult. Vaccinating enough to achieve herd immunity, which could be 60% or 70%, is the real aim.

It was designed as their lifeline. Covax signed contracts with manufacturers to buy 2bn doses by the end of this year. But it is stymied. Its main supplier is the Serum Institute of India, which is now churning out vaccines in response to the terrible surge in domestic cases and deaths and will not be able to fulfil its contracts to Covax or individual countries before the end of the year.</p> <p>Dr Bruce Aylward, senior adviser to the director general of the World Health Organization, who is heavily involved in the vaccine efforts, said: “This is where the UK becomes really important and the G7, because right now we’ve got this gap of death.

The open-air Unum music festival saw performances by 50 international and local musicians, as people embraced the chance to hear nonstop music for five days at Thrown Sand beach, 75 kilometres northwest of the capital, Tirana. AP reports that organisers claimed that everyone at the festival was free of Covid-19. “Once everyone is tested, It’ll be safer among thousands of people inside the festival than it will be outside in the general population,” Grego O’Halloran, head organiser, told Mixmag ahead of the event. “We went to the Albanian government and said that we have a way of testing people and they were like ‘Alright great, well that sounds good!’ “There will be testing stations all around the city that you can pop in to, or if you’ve got a negative PCR test arriving into Albania that will cover you for a certain period. There’ll be a double check mid-festival to make sure everything is as secure as possible.” The main stage near the beach was on top of a sailboat, while another was under the pine trees close to the beach. Festivalgoers came from all across Europe, even as far away as Uruguay. “[It’s] awesome ... crazy ... insane to see so many people in one place ... [after] sitting in one room in your apartment alone in lockdown,” said one German attendee. The event was possible because of Albania’s low contagion rate. It recorded only two new infections on Saturday. The Foreign Ministry noted there were no pandemic restrictions for anyone wanting to come to Albania. The motto of the festival was for people to become “One” and unite over music, and some said music was more important than most people realized. “It was necessary for our mental health,” said Ron Kurtolli, a DJ from Kosovo. “People don’t pay much attention to mental health, but it’s really important for the well-being of everything.” Thousands of US families with children in foster care have seen reunifications snarled as courts delayed cases, went virtual or temporarily shut down, according to an Associated Press analysis of child welfare data from 34 states. The decrease in children leaving foster care means families are lingering longer in a system intended to be temporary, as critical services were shuttered or limited. Vulnerable families are suffering long-term and perhaps irreversible damage, experts say, which could leave parents with weakened bonds with their children. The AP’s analysis found at least 8,700 fewer reunifications during the early months of the pandemic compared with the March-to-December period the year before – a decrease of 16%. Adoptions dropped too — by 23%. Overall, at least 22,600 fewer children left foster care compared with 2019. “The systemic problems around racism and poverty in Covid and how people are treated in the child welfare system may be compounding,” said Sharon Vandivere of the group Child Trends, who noted that longer stays in foster care are inherently traumatic and make reunifications less likely. Many more men in India have received Covid-19 vaccines than women, government data shows, highlighting gender disparity in the country’s immunisation drive that has also disadvantaged the rural population. Reuters reports that India has partly or fully vaccinated about 101 million men, nearly 17% more than women. Men account for 54% of the total number of people inoculated, according to the data. Many federally administered regions, the capital Delhi, and big states such as Uttar Pradesh have seen some of the worst inequities. Only Kerala in the south and Chhattisgarh in central India have vaccinated more women than men. “We are noticing that men, especially in towns and villages, prefer to take the vaccine before women as they have to travel for work, while women are relegated to domestic chores,” said Prashant Pandya, medical superintendent at a big government hospital in the western state of Gujarat. India, with a population of 1.3 billion, has about 6% more men than women. Fifteen of the UK’s Nobel prize-winning scientists, economists and peace activists have called on the country to “play a historic role” in removing “artificial” intellectual property barriers that are “restricting” Covid-19 vaccine production. In a letter to the UK prime minister, the Nobel laureates caution that “last year, science was the main barrier to beating this disease; but today, it is inequality”, with highly effective vaccines largely available only to wealthy countries. An intellectual property waiver is “an essential step to increase production”, the letter said, calling for pharmaceutical giants to be forced to share their vaccine technology and know-how through the World Health Organisation’s Covid-19 Technology Access Pool. India and South Africa first proposed a Covid vaccine waiver at the World Trade Organisation eight months ago, with the support of more than 100 mostly low and middle-income countries, but the move was blocked by a small number of rich countries including the US, Japan, the UK, and EU. Sir Richard Roberts, awarded the 1993 Nobel Prize in medicine, said: The scientific case for this is clear. If we allow Covid-19 to spread around the globe for years, not only will millions needlessly die, but the virus will continue to mutate into more virulent strains. That could undo all of our work – including the work of British scientists – in developing effective vaccines and will likely prolong the pandemic for years. We don’t have time for politicking. The intellectual property barriers to vaccine production are hindering local production of vaccines, especially in low and middle income countries, and they must be cleared away. Sir Christopher Pissarides, awarded the 2010 Nobel prize in economic sciences, said: British scientists have created life-saving vaccines that can help save the lives of millions. But it would be a tragedy if in these exceptional times they are locked away and kept secret, shared among only a handful of pharmaceutical companies. Mairead Corrigan-Maguire, awarded the 1976 Nobel peace prize, said: With high vaccination rates in rich countries while low and middle-income nations suffer, we are watching a system of vaccine apartheid develop. There is no justification for the needless loss of life in the months since India and South Africa first requested an intellectual property waiver. These are global public goods, developed largely with public funding; they belong to all of us. Boris Johnson must do what is right and support this waiver, for all of humanity. A host of celebrities including David Beckham, Olivia Colman and Billie Eilish have written to world leaders calling for surplus coronavirus vaccines to be shared with poorer countries. In an open letter, published ahead of the G7 summit on Friday, the Unicef ambassadors said the meeting was a “vital opportunity” for action to be taken. The world has spent a year and a half battling the Covid-19 pandemic, but the virus is still spreading in many countries and producing new variants with the potential to put us all back where we started. This means more school closures, more healthcare disruptions and greater economic fallout - threatening the futures of families and children everywhere. The pandemic will not be over anywhere until it is over everywhere, and that means getting vaccines to every country, as quickly and equitably as possible. This weekend’s G7 summit is a vital opportunity for you to agree the actions that will get vaccines where they are most needed, fast. Other signatories include actors Liam Neeson, Orlando Bloom, Gemma Chan, and Whoopi Goldberg, singers Katy Perry and P!nk, and UK tennis ace Andy Murray. The letter also warned that Covax, the global initiative supporting poorer countries in gaining access to vaccines, is facing a shortfall of 190 million doses. Unicef has proposed that G7 countries should donate 20% of their vaccines between June and August to help address the shortages temporarily. “As a Unicef goodwill ambassador I believe in the crucial benefit of vaccinations,” said former England footballer Beckham. “The pandemic won’t be over until it’s over everywhere, so it’s vital that all communities around the world have fair access to Covid-19 vaccines urgently.” More than 1 million Europeans have received the new EU Covid health certificate being rolled out to unlock travel within the bloc, the European Commission has said. AFP reports: EU justice commissioner Didier Reynders announced the figure to the European parliament ahead of a vote to enshrine the document in law in time for the continent’s summer tourism season. The certificate – showing the bearer’s immunity to Covid-19 either through vaccination or previous infection, or their negative test status – is to be used for intra-EU travel from 1 July. But the commission wants as many EU countries as possible to start earlier. “The more certificates we can already issue, the easier the process will be during the summer - otherwise, we risk a big bang on the first of July, which we cannot afford,” Reynders said. As of today, nine EU countries were already issuing the documents, with more than a million citizens have received such certificates – which can be presented either online or on paper – already. EU lawmakers and capitals also agreed that, when it comes to proof of vaccinations, only the jabs authorised by the European Medicines Agency – so far those from BioNTech/Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson – would be accepted in all EU countries. But individual countries can also decide to accept, for their territory only, others, such as one produced by China, or Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine. To prevent discrimination against the unvaccinated - particularly younger Europeans who have not yet been able to access jabs given in priority to the elderly - much emphasis has also been put on testing. The parliament failed to make Covid tests for travel free of charge, but extracted money and concessions from the European Commission to make them more affordable. As we emerge from a widespread internet outage, a top Japanese virologist and government adviser has said there is a risk of spreading Covid-19 during the Tokyo Olympics. Tohoku University professor Hitoshi Oshitani was an architect of Japan’s “Three Cs” approach to the pandemic, which advises avoiding closed spaces, crowds and close contact situations. He told the Times: The government and the organising committee, including the IOC (International Olympic Committee), keep saying they’re holding a safe Olympics. But everybody knows there is a risk. It’s 100% impossible to have an Olympics with zero risk … of the spread of infection in Japan and also in other countries after the Olympics. There are a number of countries that do not have many cases, and a number that don’t have any variants. We should not make the Olympics [an occasion] to spread the virus to these countries. Already postponed from last year because of the pandemic, a scaled-down version of the Games with no foreign spectators is set to start on 23 July despite public fears the event could spread the coronavirus and drain medical resources. However, a former Olympian turned public health expert, said she believed the Games can be pulled off with an acceptable level of risk. “There will be cases, but having one case or a couple of cases doesn’t mean that it was a failure,” Tara Kirk Sell, a professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told Reuters. Sell, a silver medallist swimmer at the 2004 Games, added: “These Games are very much a symbol of the whole world emerging from this terrible, global pandemic … If we wanted to be as safe as possible, we’d never leave our house.” Amid the outage, my colleague Martin Belam handed over the blog, so it will be me Mattha Busby bringing you global coronavirus updates for the next couple of hours.

China has approved the emergency use of a Covid-19 vaccine for those as young as three, according to a spokesperson for Sinovac. That would make it the first country to offer jabs to young children. Britain ignored scientific advice and instead took a political decision when it failed to put Malta on its list of safe travel destinations, Malta foreign minister Evarist Bartolo said. Visitors to Portugal must now quarantine for 10 days on return to England, as the county’s move to the “red list” came into effect. Vietnam has started asking for public donations to buy vaccines as it struggles to contain a new coronavirus wave. Unicef has urged rich members of the G7 to start donating vaccines to poor countries now, instead of waiting to donate leftovers all at once, saying many nations don’t have capacity to roll out huge amounts in one go. India’s government will provide free vaccinations for all adults, Prime Minister Narendra Modi says, as the capital New Delhi and financial hub Mumbai ease lockdowns on falling infection levels. The state of Uttar Pradesh in India has announced that it will end some Covid restrictions. The weekday daytime curfew would be lifted in all 75 districts of the state, as all of them have fallen below 600 active Covid cases. The president of the Tokyo 2020 organizsing committee, Seiko Hashimoto, has announced that there will be restrictions on the movement media using GPS tracking during the Games. New Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Tuesday that she would get her first Covid-19 shot at the end of next week. Canada is preparing to ease birder restrictions for vaccinated travellers, Bloomberg reports. The Czech Republic has announced it will reopen its borders to EU and Serbian citizens on June 21. Spain’s football squad will be get a Covid-19 vaccine shot, less than a week before their opening Euro 2020 match, after captain Sergio Busquets tested positive. Health officials in New South Wales, Australia, have had to reiterate advice over Covid-19 after a number of businesses in Byron Shire were witnessed asking vaccinated customers not to enter their premises under the misapprehension they could shed the virus. Vietnam, once a model for its successful handling of the pandemic, has started asking for public donations to buy vaccines as it struggles to contain a new coronavirus wave. AFP reports that the south-east Asian country has vaccinated only about 1% of its population of nearly 100 million, and authorities have become increasingly alarmed by a recent spike in cases. Since last week, mobile phone users have received up to three text messages urging them to contribute to a Covid-19 vaccine fund, while civil servants have been encouraged to part with a day’s pay. Some residents, fearful of the virus’ impact on Vietnam’s economy – one of the few in the world to expand last year – told AFP they support the fundraising drive. Nguyen Tuan Anh, a civil servant, told AFP he had sent about $50 via bank transfer and SMS payment, as vaccines would mean “Vietnam’s economy will be stable and develop again”. Vietnam’s industrial northern provinces – home to key factories such as Samsung and Foxconn – have been particularly badly hit by the latest outbreak. Across the country, tens of thousands of people have lost their jobs, according to state media, with bars and restaurants forced to close in major hubs such as Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City and public gatherings cancelled. Cases have more than tripled since April to reach almost 9,000. Although the number is low in comparison to most of its south-east Asian neighbours, Vietnam’s vaccination rate per capita is the lowest in the region, and among the lowest in Asia, according to an AFP tally. The Spanish football squad’s players will be get a Covid-19 vaccine shot tomorrow, less than a week before their opening Euro 2020 match, after captain Sergio Busquets tested positive, Sports Minister Jose Manuel Rodriguez Uribes said. Busquets’ positive has thrown Spain’s tournament preparations into chaos with the remaining 23 players going into isolation along with the coaching staff. An Under-21 side led by their coach Luis de la Fuente will face Lithuania tonight in what was supposed to be the nation’s final warm-up game before the Euros. Coach Luis Enrique called up a group of six players, including Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga, to complement the squad. They will train separately in “parallel bubble” away from the main Euros squad with a view to them being added should the need occur. Reuters report that so far, all the other players and staff have tested negative. “We are making an exception because they represent us in a top level competition,” Rodriguez Uribes told Cadena Ser radio station, adding that they were already planning to give them the shots before Spain’s captain had tested positive. Health officials in New South Wales, Australia, have had to reiterate advice over Covid-19 after a number of businesses in Byron Shire were witnessed asking vaccinated customers not to enter their premises under the misapprehension they could shed the virus. The New South Wales department of health has stressed that it is impossible for people to develop, shed, or spread the virus through receiving a vaccine. The advice comes after some businesses in the small town of Mullumbimby placed signs in their windows that read: ‘If you have had the Covid-19 vaccine we ask you not to enter for two weeks or longer until any symptoms subside’. One of the signs falsely states that the spread of the virus following vaccination was emerging from “first hand accounts” and that vaccinated people were “inadvertently harming” the health of others. The town is located in the Northern Rivers region of New South Wales and is about 15km inland from Byron Bay. It is a region with a high level of vaccine hesitancy and refusal, with childhood vaccination rates among the lowest in Australia. A former paramedic who runs a World Health Organisation [WHO] approved vaccination information website, Heidi Robertson, said she was appalled to see the signs as she walked down Stuart Street on Monday. She and health professionals living in the region, including intensive care specialist Dr Rachael Heap, have been working hard for several years to educate the community about vaccination. “We wanted to change the narrative around the region, because we’ve got such a shocking rate of vaccination uptake and we are known for that in Mullumbimby,” Robertson said.

I’ll keep my focus on international Covid news here. A total of 95 deaths registered in England and Wales in the week ending 28 May mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) - the lowest number since the week ending 4 September 2020. PA note that the figure is down 11% on the previous week. It is the first time the number of deaths has been below 100 since the week ending 11 September. Around one in 100 deaths registered in the week to 28 May mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate. China has approved the emergency use of a Covid-19 vaccine for those as young as three, according to a spokesperson for Sinovac who spoke to AFP. That would make it the first country to offer jabs to young children. “In recent days, the Sinovac vaccine was approved for emergency use in three- to 17-year-olds,” the spokesperson said. But they did not confirm when the young children would be able to start receiving the shots, saying the schedule for the rollout will be decided by the National Health Commission “according to China’s current epidemic prevention and control needs and vaccine supply”. The company has completed early phase trials of the vaccine in children and adolescents, with results to be published shortly in the Lancet scientific journal, the spokesperson added. State broadcaster CCTV reported over the weekend that an unnamed official in the State Council’s epidemic response task force had said vaccines had been approved for children, and “the safety and effectiveness” had been proven. A spokesperson for China’s other major vaccine, Sinopharm, said that experts had demonstrated the effectiveness of its vaccine in children, but didn’t confirm whether it had been approved for use. A quick one from Reuters: Russia reported 9,977 new Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, including 3,817 in Moscow. The government coronavirus task force also said that 379 people had died of coronavirus-related causes in the last 24 hours, pushing the official death toll to 124,496. That’s far fewer than the 270,000 that the state statistics service says had died from Covid-19 and related causes from April 2020 to April 2021. Britain ignored scientific advice and instead took a political decision when it failed to put Malta on its list of safe travel destinations, Malta Foreign Minister Evarist Bartolo said. Britons traditionally account for a third of all arrivals on the small Mediterranean island, and opposition politicians criticised the government for failing to convince London that Malta was a safe tourist destination. Britain last week revised its so-called “green list” of countries, that do not require quarantine on return, choosing not to put any new country on it, while removing Portugal. But Bartolo said the British government did not want its nationals to go abroad because of concerns over growing coronavirus cases at home. “The British government is ignoring scientific advice. It has taken a political decision not to allow travel anywhere, despite the pressure it faces from airlines, tourism operators and the people in general,” he wrote on Facebook. Chris Scicluna reports from Valetta for Reuters that Malta on Monday reported no new Covid-19 cases for the first time in 11 months. Half of its adult population has been fully vaccinated and 75% have received a first dose of a vaccine - the highest rate within the European Union. Dr Nikki Kanani, director of primary care at NHS England, said that vaccine confidence in younger people had increased in the UK. Speaking as over-25s were invited to book their Covid-19 jabs, PA report Dr Kanani told BBC Breakfast: “We’re still seeing great uptake and we are definitely seeing younger people coming in and asking more questions, which is absolutely fine. “More than four in five 40 to 49-year-olds have had their first dose and two-thirds of 30 to 39-year-olds have already had theirs, and that is still going to increase, of course, as people come forward, so uptake remains high. “We had additional polling over the weekend that shows that the confidence in the vaccine has increased by a fifth - by 20% - in those under-40s. “What’s really important as we go into the younger categories is really appealing to people in their own communities and what our teams have done so well is reflect what a community needs locally - whether that’s setting up pop-up vaccination centres in Gurudwaras or temples, or in shopping malls or at workplaces, that has been critical to making sure that people feel confident to take up the vaccine when they’re asked to do so.” Overnight saw a rush to travel back to the UK from Portugal, as travellers had until 4am to return to avoid having to quarantine for 10 days after the country was moved from the “green” list to the “amber” list, without being placed on a watchlist first. The UK’s environment minister has been getting a tough ride on the media morning round in the UK – being asked whether the travel rules, and government advice, have to be this complicated, and why there was so little warning of the change of status. Eustace said “Our advice has always been that you should not travel to countries on the amber list.” The Gaby Hinsliff column today asks the question before Britain vaccinates children, should it vaccinate the world? She writes: Personally I was thrilled to get my vaccine and would be more than happy for my son to have it, but what brought me up short was the question I saw posed recently by the epidemiologist Adam Kucharski: if rich countries have enough vaccine left to jab children at incredibly low risk of serious illness and death, why aren’t they offering it to poorer countries where people are dying for lack of it? Shouldn’t we be taking more seriously the threat not just of humanitarian crises, but of a more resistant variant emerging in some place where the virus is currently raging out of control, fatally undermining the vaccines that remain our only real route to freedom? Only 2% of sub-Saharan Africa has had a first dose. Thailand, engulfed by a severe outbreak, is only just beginning mass vaccinations. Even if the G7 summit agrees this week to invest billions in ramping up vaccine production for poorer countries – as a group of former world leaders led by Gordon Brown wants – that takes months to come on stream. If Britain doesn’t want to seal its borders – and nothing in ministers’ confused approach to foreign holidays suggests they do – then digging an ever-stronger domestic firebreak against the more contagious Delta variant we have just imported from India won’t be enough. We’re going to need a global firebreak against something worse evolving too, and fast. Read more here: Gaby Hinsliff – Before Britain vaccinates children, should it vaccinate the world? Helen Davidson reports from Taipei: Some tentative good news from Taiwan, with a second consecutive day of cases in the 200s and no new cases from backlogged test results. As long as results are not down because of lower weekend testing, the decline is a positive sign in Taiwan’s battle against its worst outbreak of the pandemic. However with about 8,000 cases still active, fatalities have not stopped and authorities reported another 22 deaths. The new cases were mostly in New Taipei city, with 123 recorded. Another 54 were reported from the capital Taipei, while 16 were found in Miaoli where there are growing concerns over an outbreak among employees from three factories which has so far infected 211 people. Health and welfare minister, Chen Chih-shung, said the rate of positive cases in New Taipei was dropping but there was no room yet to relax current restrictions. He urged people not to travel during an upcoming long weekend and dragon-boat festival, which authorities have not cancelled. Vaccine supplies took another hit, with authorities saying expected shipments of AstraZeneca and from Covax had been delayed by about a month. Half of the 150,000 recently obtained Moderna vaccines have been allocated to frontline medical staff. China’s vaccination numbers are never low. Official figures reported by Reuters say that the nation administered about 16.3 million doses of vaccine on 7 June, bringing the total number administered to 794m. In India, the state of Uttar Pradesh has announced that it will end some Covid restrictions. The Hindustan Times reports this morning: The Uttar Pradesh government on Tuesday gave relaxations in ‘corona curfew’ in all 75 districts of the state. According to guidelines announced by the state government, districts with less than 600 active cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) can get relaxations. A state government spokesperson said that there will be relaxation in coronavirus curfew in all the districts of the state from Wednesday onwards, from 7am to 7pm, for five days. However, the night curfew – 7pm to 7am and weekend curfew (for entire day) – will continue. The UK’s environment secretary George Eustace – a man who clearly isn’t in the position where he hasn’t seen family and loved ones abroad for over a year due to travel bans – has told Sky News this morning: “I have no intention of travelling or going on a holiday abroad this summer.” He was being pressed by newly returned presenter Kay Burley on the scramble for flights back from Portugal after it was moved from the “green list” to the “amber list” with very little warning. PA Media quotes him saying: Our advice has been don’t travel unless it’s absolutely necessary. Obviously we had hoped, with these three categories that we had, we had hoped that situation would be improving in other parts of the world, that we’d be able to progressively add other countries to the green list. Sadly, that’s not the situation, we do have this new variant of concern first identified in India that is now cropping up in other countries, and we’ve just got to take a very cautious approach. Asked about the UK government’s delay in shutting down travel from India, he said “India was added as soon as we saw a spike in rates and as soon as we saw there was a reason to”, denying that the delay had been political. At the time Indian case numbers were rising and the government took no action, UK prime minister Boris Johnson had been planning to visit India in his first major trip abroad since the pandemic, with the aim of pushing a post-Brexit UK-India trade deal. Unicef has urged rich members of the G7 to start donating vaccines to poor countries now, instead of waiting to donate leftovers all at once, saying many nations don’t have capacity to roll out huge amounts in one go. Unicef’s vaccine lead Lily Caprani told BBC Newsnight governments in the UK and other G7 nations “need to donate their doses to those low income countries now, while still vaccinating their populations at home.” “Low income countries need a steady supply that they can get off the tarmac and into the arms of health care workers... The unintended consequence of saving all these vaccines up to Christmas time is that countries won’t be able to absorb them and roll them out and therefore they could end up going to waste. We could see millions of doses of vaccines not used and expiring, and that will be a tragedy.” The World Health Organization has also called on Covid-19 vaccine manufacturers to give the Covax scheme first refusal on new doses, or commit half of their volumes to the global jab equity scheme. Our health editor Sarah Boseley asks the question this morning: Can we vaccinate the world against Covid by the end of 2022? As ambitious declarations go – even for Boris Johnson – it was a big one. At the weekend, the UK prime minister said he would urge the G7 leaders to vaccinate the world against Covid by the end of next year. But is this feasible? That rather depends on your definition. No country will vaccinate every adult. Vaccinating enough to achieve herd immunity, which could be 60% or 70%, is the real aim. It is possible to achieve that by December 2023, say experts, but only if the G7 leading economies move immediately to make it happen. The Covax scheme under the UN umbrella should have been the route to vaccination for low-income countries. It was designed as their lifeline. Covax signed contracts with manufacturers to buy 2bn doses by the end of this year. But it is stymied. Its main supplier is the Serum Institute of India, which is now churning out vaccines in response to the terrible surge in domestic cases and deaths and will not be able to fulfil its contracts to Covax or individual countries before the end of the year. Dr Bruce Aylward, senior adviser to the director general of the World Health Organization, who is heavily involved in the vaccine efforts, said: “This is where the UK becomes really important and the G7, because right now we’ve got this gap of death. In June, July, August, September, there’s no vaccine out there for love nor money, in terms of being able to procure it.” Read more of Sarah Boseley’s analysis here: Can we vaccinate the world against Covid by the end of 2022? The president of the Tokyo 2020 organising committee, Seiko Hashimoto, is speaking this morning, and she is setting out some of the procedures that will be undertaken to try to keep the games safe. So far, she’s said that media will not be able to use shared accommodation, and that the media will be GPS-tracked to ensure they don’t go into unauthorised areas. She has also said that they expect to start vaccinating Olympics-related staff by mid-June. Reuters note that foreign spectators have already been banned, and organisers are expected to make a decision late this month on domestic spectators. Toshiaki Endo, the vice-president of the Tokyo organising committee, has previously suggested to Reuters some spectators could be allowed into venues, although he personally preferred a total ban to calm persistent public opposition to the Games. On the downside, I just saw this tweet today, and now I can’t stop thinking about it either… Good morning, it is Martin Belam here in London taking over today’s blog. The biggest news in England is the extension of vaccinations to those aged 25 and over this morning. If you fall into that category you can book your shot at the NHS England site here. Northern Ireland has already been offering vaccines to anybody over 18, you can find out more here. Those in Scotland and Wales can find out the latest information for them here: NHS Scotland Gov.wales Reuters: New Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Tuesday that she would get her first Covid-19 shot at the end of next week, as the country prepared to receive another 1 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine. “For me, it’s been important that I allow those in the most at risk group... to be prioritised,” Ardern said in a news conference. “I’m choosing to be vaccinated at this point in order to play my role in demonstrating that I consider it to be absolutely safe and also really critical to keep others safe,” she said. China today pledged further assistance to Southeast Asian nations in battling the pandemic, the Associated Press reports. The country’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, told his Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) counterparts that China had already delivered 100 million doses of vaccine to Asean nations along with other materials and technical help. Wang said China would “urgently implement” the China-Asean Public Health Cooperation Initiative, continue to support the Asean Emergency Medical Materials Reserve and strengthen regional public health capacity-building. “China will work with Asean to overcome the outbreak as soon as possible,” Wang told a meeting of ministers. He said the sides should explore establishing an expert panel to strengthen cooperation throughout the vaccine process, from research to use, and work to build production and distribution centres to help make vaccines affordable and accessible in the region. Though Covid-19 was first detected in China in late 2019, the nation has largely stamped out domestic transmission, although it has been accused of insufficient transparency or even seeking to conceal the origins of the pandemic. Beijing has been building influence with Asean, despite frictions with some members of the bloc over competing territorial claims in the South China Sea. Welcome to another day of the pandemic, and our continuing global coverage of the latest developments. Below are some of the key updates from the last day. Canada is preparing to ease birder restrictions for vaccinated travellers, Bloomberg reports. A top Japanese virologist and government adviser has warned of the risks of spreading infections during the Tokyo Olympics. Australia’s state of Victoria is on track to ease restrictions on residents, currently in a lockdown to deal with an outbreak of the Delta variant, authorities said. India’s government will provide free vaccinations for all adults, Prime Minister Narendra Modi says, as the capital New Delhi and financial hub Mumbai ease lockdowns on falling infection levels. A new coronavirus antibody drug appears to show promise in mouse studies, according to a study published in Nature. The Czech Republic has announced it will reopen its borders to EU and Serbian citizens on June 21. Just days before the start of the Euros, Spain’s football players and staff have returned negative Covid-19 tests after captain Sergio Busquets had to go home and quarantine. There was “delight across Ireland” as the country reopened pubs, restaurants and leisure facilities. Central Park is to host an “all-star” concert in August to mark New York’s comeback after the pandemic. New York governor Andrew Cuomo has announced that the state’s remaining coronavirus restrictions will be lifted when 70% of residents have had at least one vaccine dose.","charCount":"36794","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/mattha-busby\">Mattha Busby</a> (now);

Before he sets off for the G7 summit in the UK later this week, the prime minister will use a foreign policy speech to say that “ambition alone won’t solve the problem of actually reducing emissions”. Morrison is also expected to characterise carbon border tariffs – an idea that is gathering momentum in international discussions as a way to avoid heavy-emitting industries shifting to countries with less ambitious climate commitments – as a “combative” protectionist measure. In an address to a thinktank in Perth on Wednesday, Morrison is expected to address tensions with China, saying Australia is “far from isolated” despite Beijing rolling out a series of trade actions against Australian export sectors over the past year. According to speech remarks distributed to media in advance, Morrison will say Australia has made clear it is “not a nation that can be easily marginalised and driven to unacceptable compromises”. He warns that the risks of miscalculation and conflict in the Indo-Pacific region “are growing” amid increasing competition between China and the US, and insists that liberal democracies should “reinforce, renovate and buttress a world order that favours freedom”. But amid increasing international focus on the climate crisis, Morrison appears to be digging in against deeper emission cuts and sector-specific targets as part of the pathway to net-zero emissions. The UK, which is hosting the G7 summit in Cornwall, England, has made clear that climate is its top foreign policy priority this year, and the Biden administration also recently called on Australia to cut emissions faster than planned. But Morrison says it should be up to sovereign nations to chart their own course. “It’s important that nation states be accountable for charting their own path to net zero based on their unique economic structures and energy sources,” Morrison is expected to say in the speech to the Perth USAsia Centre. “Australia does not support setting sectoral targets or timeframes for decarbonising particular parts of our economy or setting false deadlines for phasing out specific energy sources.” The G7 ministers responsible for climate and environment released a statement in May describing coal power generation as “the single biggest cause of global temperature increases” and committing the big developed economies to “further accelerate the transition away from unabated coal capacity and to an overwhelmingly decarbonised power system in the 2030s”. The US president, Joe Biden, has set a target of a 50% to 52% cut in economy-wide net greenhouse gas pollution by 2030, compared with 2005 levels, and has also set a sector-specific goal of reaching 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035. But the Australian government remains committed to its Abbott-era target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by 2030. In the prepared speech, Morrison says Australia will continue to be a strong voice for a technology-focused approach and for countries to work together to drive down the cost of low-emissions technologies, rather than acting “combatively through protectionist measures”. Such an approach, according to Morrison, “will ensure that emissions abatement doesn’t come at the cost of growth and jobs”. He says his government will release a long-term emissions reduction strategy before the Cop26 climate summit is held in Glasgow in November, but argues Australia has already “reduced emissions by 20% since 2005 – more than Canada, New Zealand, Japan and the US”. Ahead of a climate summit organised by Biden in April, Morrison claimed Australia had achieved “a reduction in our domestic emissions of some 36%” based on “when you exclude exports” – but this presentation of the data stunned analysts. Morrison, who has so far resisted making a concrete commitment to net-zero emissions by 2050 amid internal resistance within the Coalition, is expected to acknowledge on Wednesday that “a new global energy economy is rising with profound implications for Australia as the world deals with climate change”. He will say governments, international agencies and financial markets are crafting a net-zero energy economy and Australia needs to be part of those conversations about how to achieve it without risking manufacturing and heavy industry jobs. “Our goal is to get [to net zero] as soon as possible, preferably by 2050, through technology that enables and transforms our industries, not taxes that eliminate them and the jobs and livelihoods they support, especially in our regions,” he is to say. In other remarks, Morrison will vow to work with other leaders at the G7 on reform of the World Trade Organisation, which he described as “one of the most powerful tools the international community has to counter economic coercion”. He is also expected to call for the restoration of the WTO’s binding dispute settlement system, which stalled amid resistance from the Trump administration. Morrison is due to fly to Singapore for talks with the prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, on Thursday, on his way to Cornwall for the G7 summit. Australia, India, South Korea and South Africa are not G7 members but have been invited to attend. On the sidelines of the G7, Morrison is set to have a series of meetings with other leaders, including his first face-to-face talks with Biden. Morrison will meet with Boris Johnson early next week and the two sides are hoping to finalise an in-principle agreement on a free trade deal, before Morrison heads to France for talks with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, focused on the Indo-Pacific and the contentious submarine deal.","charCount":"5881","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/daniel-hurst\">Daniel Hurst</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2021/jun/08/centre-left-unite-union-leadership-candidate-through-to-final-ballot","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-08T12:29:02Z","webTitle":"Centre-left Unite union leadership candidate through to final ballot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jun/08/centre-left-unite-union-leadership-candidate-through-to-final-ballot","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2021/jun/08/centre-left-unite-union-leadership-candidate-through-to-final-ballot","fields":{"headline":"Centre-left Unite union leadership candidate through to final ballot","standfirst":"<p>Gerard Coyne says he has the 174 branch nominations required in the race to succeed Len McCluskey</p>","trailText":"Gerard Coyne says he has the 174 branch nominations required in the race to succeed Len McCluskey","byline":"Rajeev Syal","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f0304e4799f73eb2419c96053744a2b31b2e5e38\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0304e4799f73eb2419c96053744a2b31b2e5e38/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gerard Coyne’s success means the three leftwing contestants face the prospect of splitting the vote.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gerard Coyne’s success means the three leftwing contestants face the prospect of splitting the vote.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jane Barlow/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>The race to succeed Len McCluskey as the leader of Unite the union is expected to become increasingly tense after the centre-left candidate Gerard Coyne disclosed to the Guardian that he has won enough nominations to reach the final ballot.</p> <p>The announcement is expected to prompt furious negotiations between Coyne’s leftwing rivals as they seek to persuade each other to stand down to keep Coyne out.</p> <p>The close of nominations on Wednesday is expected to spark negotiations between Sharon Graham, Steve Turner and Howard Beckett as supporters seek to maintain control of the union’s industrial muscle before names are put forward for a final ballot of the union’s 1.2 million members.</p> <p>A close associate of Graham insists there is “not a cat in hell’s chance” she will make way for her two male rivals from the left and she plans to be the union’s first female leader.</p> <p>Supporters of the left candidates had grown increasingly concerned that Coyne, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/21/len-mccluskey-re-elected-leader-of-unite-union-jeremy-corbyn\">was narrowly defeated by McCluskey</a> in a 2017 contest, may reach the threshold of 174 branch nominations that would allow him to make the runoff.</p> <p>The contest will be watched closely by Keir Starmer and the parliamentary Labour party.

The announcement is expected to prompt furious negotiations between Coyne’s leftwing rivals as they seek to persuade each other to stand down to keep Coyne out. The close of nominations on Wednesday is expected to spark negotiations between Sharon Graham, Steve Turner and Howard Beckett as supporters seek to maintain control of the union’s industrial muscle before names are put forward for a final ballot of the union’s 1.2 million members. A close associate of Graham insists there is “not a cat in hell’s chance” she will make way for her two male rivals from the left and she plans to be the union’s first female leader. Supporters of the left candidates had grown increasingly concerned that Coyne, who was narrowly defeated by McCluskey in a 2017 contest, may reach the threshold of 174 branch nominations that would allow him to make the runoff. The contest will be watched closely by Keir Starmer and the parliamentary Labour party. Unite has been a strong critic of his style and politics, and has maintained close alignment with Jeremy Corbyn and his former supporters. Coyne, a former regional organiser in the West Midlands and generally supportive of Starmer, has called for the union to focus on its members rather than controlling Labour, and has called for an independent probe into the use of members’ money to build a £98m conference centre in Birmingham. He told the Guardian on Tuesday that he has passed the threshold. “I’m delighted to have received so much support from Unite members from across the union and can confirm I will be accepting the nomination. “Any suggestion that there will be a grubby backroom deal between the three continuity candidates would be both anti-democratic and a betrayal of Unite members right to choose … It will also show they are running scared and how desperate they are to block real change,” he said. Sources from within the candidates’ camps said that attempts have been made by senior figures in the party to reach out to Graham to persuade her to step down. A close associate of Graham, who is seeking to disentangle the union from Labour’s internal politics, said: “There is not a cat in hell of Sharon standing down. She has [nominations from] Hinkley Point, health trusts and in Edinburgh city council and a real breadth of support among Unite’s industrial branches.” “Given her profile and the level of support she has across the branches, maybe one of the men would like to step aside for a woman?” Left activists are concerned that three candidates would split the vote in a first-past-the-post leadership election, allowing Coyne to win. Beckett, the union’s former legal adviser who was recently suspended from Labour for saying that Priti Patel should be deported instead of refugees, has been a close aide to McCluskey. He is advocating an increase in the union’s strike fund from £40m to £50m.

That detente effectively ended on Sunday, when Manchin authored an op-ed making it clear he will not vote for the bill, leaving Democrats to find a new path forward – that is, if there is one at all. Manchin did not raise substantive concerns about the legislation, the For the People Act, in the Senate but rather said that he would only support it if it was bipartisan. He also reiterated his resistance to eliminating the filibuster, a legislative rule that requires 60 votes to move most legislation forward in the Senate. Getting 10 Republicans to sign on to voting rights legislation is a fool’s errand, many observers say, pointing to how the party has embraced Trump’s baseless lies about the election and is actively trying to make it harder to vote. “Republican intransigence on voting rights is not an excuse for inaction and Senator Manchin must wake up to this fact,” said Karen Hobart Flynn, the president of Common Cause, a government watchdog group, which backs the bill.

No one will be required to share information about non-Covid vaccinations or other health data.</p> <p>Proof of immunisation is seen as vital to relaxing restrictions long term, with some businesses and political leaders floating it as an incentive to receive jabs.<br></p> <p>The government services minister, <strong>Linda Reynolds, </strong>said the new record would make it simple for people to show their vaccination status.<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Covid-19 digital certificate makes proof of vaccination accessible anytime, anywhere.</p> </blockquote> <p>The certificate can be accessed through the Medicare app or online through myGov.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-06-08T23:44:49.207Z\">at 12.44am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-60bffde48f0827600c04cf74\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-08T23:35:41.651Z\">12.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Just a quick shout out to the artist whose artwork is featured in the header photo of the blog today. </p> <p>The piece is called “Spatial deconstruction #23 (resilience)“, so a fairly fitting photo for today’s news, and it’s by the fantastic <strong>Emma Coulter</strong>. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Instagram post of artwork.\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot;

People who have had both doses of Pfizer or AstraZeneca are able to access proof through their Medicare account, reports Matt Coughlan from AAP. Australian Medical Association president Omar Khorshid told ABC radio on Wednesday that allowing immunisation status to be shown on a screen without disclosing other private health information was a logical step. Australians need to be able to prove they are vaccinated one way or another... It’s going to be needed for international travel. It may well be needed in many workplaces. Yes, we do support a mechanism for you to demonstrate your vaccine status. The certificate has a coat of arms hologram and includes the person’s name, date of birth and a green tick of validity. No one will be required to share information about non-Covid vaccinations or other health data. Proof of immunisation is seen as vital to relaxing restrictions long term, with some businesses and political leaders floating it as an incentive to receive jabs. The government services minister, Linda Reynolds, said the new record would make it simple for people to show their vaccination status. The Covid-19 digital certificate makes proof of vaccination accessible anytime, anywhere. The certificate can be accessed through the Medicare app or online through myGov. Just a quick shout out to the artist whose artwork is featured in the header photo of the blog today. The piece is called “Spatial deconstruction #23 (resilience)“, so a fairly fitting photo for today’s news, and it’s by the fantastic Emma Coulter. If you are keen to see more of her work she has a super bright and fun Instagram page here. The Victorian truth and justice commission, the Yoo-rrook Justice Commission has named Dunghutti man Josh Smith as its inaugural CEO. The Yoo-rrook Justice Commission, announced in March, is preparing to conduct an inquiry into the ongoing effects of violent dispossession and genocide as part of the process to get to Treaty in Victoria. Commissioners have already been named. Smith is a career public servant — his previous roles include the deputy secretary of Aboriginal justice at the Victorian Department of Justice and Community. The announcement of his appointment said Smith would “assist the commissioners in helping them to achieve the commission’s objectives, including those related to truth-telling, educating the wider public and making recommendations for structural reform”. He starts on 21 June. If are keen to learn more about the Biloela family’s situation, and the timeline of medical care three-year-old Tharnicaa received, can I suggest this fantastic explainer from Melissa Davey and Josh Taylor: Priya Nadesalingam has become a fierce advocate for her young daughters – Tharnicaa, three, and Kopika, five, – since her family was taken from their central Queensland home in 2018 and put in detention after her and her husband’s visas had expired. Family friend Simone Cameron said Nadesalingam has had no choice but to fight for the girls, who were both born in Australia. The health of her daughters has significantly deteriorated since the family was moved to immigration detention by Border Force officials. Only allowed half an hour outside a day in the early months of detention, Tharnicaa and Kopika became vitamin D deficient and prone to repeated infections. Tharnicaa was two when her teeth were so rotten she needed surgery to have two of them removed. You can read the full timeline below: Queensland is (local) Covid-19 free as well by the way! Victoria’s acting premier, James Merlino, is expected to give a press conference mid-morning announcing that the lockdown in Melbourne will lift from midnight on Thursday. The Victorian government has not confirmed any of the conditions which will apply post-lockdown, and says it did not provide them. But it is not refuting reports in the Herald Sun which suggest that the post-lockdown conditions will include: A 25km travel limit for people in greater Melbourne to prevent people travelling to regional areas for the Queen’s Birthday long weekend. Students returning to the classroom as early as Friday. Outdoor gatherings limited to 10 people. Cafes and restaurants limited to 50 customers. Visitors to the home still banned. Gyms to remain closed. Mandatory face masks indoors. Density limits in offices. Again, these are not confirmed rules — but they appear pretty likely. It’s not clear yet how long they will remain in place. Some may be lifted after the long weekend. We’ll bring you all the official details once the announcement is made in a few hours. A Tamil asylum seeker family detained at a Christmas Island facility has had no communication with the federal government about the prospect of being sent to the US or New Zealand, reports AAP. The Murugappan family’s lawyer Carina Ford on Wednesday responded to suggestion the two countries were likely destinations, as the government continues to reject pleas they be allowed to remain in Australia. For the record we and our clients have not been approached about this by the government - we have written to the Department of Home Affairs to ask why. The family has been on the island, far off the West Australian coast, for two years after being removed by federal authorities from their home in Biloela, Queensland. The home affairs department had been threatening to send them back to Sri Lanka, despite the family’s pleas they would be targeted. On Tuesday, the home affairs minister, Karen Andrews, said “a range of resettlement options” were under negotiation. The foreign minister, Marise Payne, later expanded on that statement, saying the US and NZ were options. “I do know that the minister for home affairs, Ms Andrews, has indicated that there are two options there, and the United States and New Zealand are both in the frame,” she told Sydney radio 2GB. Vigils will be held outside the hospital in Perth on Wednesday evening, where the youngest daughter is being treated after being medically evacuated from Christmas Island, and at Sydney Town Hall on Thursday. Victoria has recorded just one new locally acquired case overnight, which the department of health has confirmed was linked to the current outbreak and was already quarantining. This absolutely bolsters the idea that Melbourne will be allowed out of lockdown from Friday. Massive mouse plague news! (The only news I care about) The NSW government will provide up to $100m in rebates to farmers purchasing the mouse control chemical zinc phosphide amid a plague of the rodent blighting rural and regional communities. NSW farmers will be offered a rebate of 50% on their purchase of zinc phosphide - which is already tax deductible - up to $10,000. This comes after the agriculture minister, Adam Marshall, had controversially focused the government’s response on getting a permit to use the currently agriculturally banned super-strong mouse killer bromadiolone. Last month the NSW government secured 5000 litres of the anti-coagulant, enough to treat about 95 tonnes of grain, to be provided to farmers for free once federal authorities approve its use. But environmentalist and the NSW Farmer’s Association were quick to express concerns about the extremely high secondary poisoning risk to native animals that comes with this poison. Unlike zinc phosphide, bromadiolone stays in a mouse’s body after death, placing all scavenger animals, such as owls, raptors, snakes, fish and even domestic pets, at risk. In a statement, Marshall said the government was also chipping in $5m to help transport zinc phosphide to Australia. Mice have been running rampant through large tracts of inland NSW and parts of southern Queensland since last year, destroying crops and causing significant damage to tonnes of stored hay and grain. In case anyone was wondering, the Victorian Liberals haven’t been totally chased out of town and were out and about again this morning. The Federal Court has ruled while most Greenpeace social media posts using energy provider, AGL’s logo next to the tagline “Australia’s greatest liability” fall under “fair dealing”, some lacked parody and therefore breached the company’s copyright. Basically ruling the environmental group has to be funnier or risk further legal action. Greenpeace launched a campaign in May while publishing a report detailing the provider’s responsibility for 8% of Australia’s carbon emissions. AGL sought an urgent injunction in the Federal Court, saying allegations of environmental wrongdoing were “unsubstantiated” and it wanted to protect its copyright, reports AAP. Greenpeace argued its use of the AGL logo should fall under “fair dealing” provisions in Australian copyright law as it is clearly satire or parody. While justice Stephen Burley agreed with the not-for-profit in his ruling on Tuesday, he said not every post was humoured enough for this to apply. The ridicule potent in the message is likely to be immediately perceived... Many would see these uses of the modified AGL logo as darkly humorous because the combined effect is ridiculous. AGL is exposed to ridicule by the use of its corporate imagery including by use of the modified AGL logo to convey a message that AGL would not wish to send. However, no satire was featured in a photo of a school student holding a poster that contained only the logo, the term “Australia’s Biggest Climate Polluter” and “Greenpeace”. That, and a handful of other social media posts and placards, did breach AGL’s copyright, Burley ruled. Greenpeace said the ruling was an affirmation that the law “is on the side of freedom of expression”, promising to continue pressuring AGL to close its coal-burning power stations by 2030. The energy giant welcomed the court’s ruling that its logo had been misused on some occasions and reiterated the case was about “the integrity of how our brand is used”. The parties will return to court on Thursday to address questions of costs and the form of injunctive relief. You can read Guardian Australia’s previous reporting on this court case here: If you were hanging out with me on the blog yesterday you might remember the (truly wild) decision from the Victorian Liberals to publish a list of questions about the Victorian premier Daniel Andrew’s March fall where he fractured his spine. There’s no point beating around the bush, it was a move that pretty clearly stoked the flames of conspiracy theories in the state and has been pretty broadly condemned. Well, now it’s time for the federal Liberals to pay the piper for their state counterparts, with the trade minister, Dan Tehan, being asked about it on ABC news breakfast this morning. Michael Rowland: You are a member of the Victorian Liberal Party, in fact a senior member of the Victorian party. What do you make of the grassy knoll conspiracy theories being circulated by the state opposition regarding the premier, Daniel Andrews’, back accident? Tehan: As I understand it, it wasn’t grassy knoll conspiracy theories. A series of questions were asked by the opposition... Look, the opposition in Victoria has the right to ask questions. That is what happens in a properly functioning democracy... Some of them I would prefer not to be asked, but they are and that is what happens in a properly functioning Liberal democracy and the Victorian opposition have the right to ask those questions... Rowland: Do you believe they are fair questions? Not if they are right. I am asking you, you are a senior member of the Victorian Liberal Party, Dan Tehan, do you believe they are fair questions? Tehan: The opposition has the right to ask questions. It is up to commentators to decide whether they are fair, whether they are not fair. They have the right to ask those questions and, can I say, I support Louise Staley asking requests as a member of the opposition in Victoria. That is what functioning Liberal parties are all about and good on Louise for asking requests as the opposition shadow treasurer. Dan Tehan is being grilled over the Biloela family’s situation after the foreign minister yesterday suggested the young family could be resettled in the UK or New Zealand rather than returning home to their rural town where the community has been protesting for years to get them back. (Take a sip of coffee for every time Tehan says “before the courts”: I saw her comments yesterday. I also know that this issue and this matter is before the courts, but [the foreign minister] has been pursuing that. Host Michael Rowland: Is there any prospect at all of this family being returned to their community in Biloela if Queensland? Tehan: Look, my understanding is that matter is before the courts, so therefore I won’t be commenting any further on it, but also my understanding is based on the comments that Marise Payne made yesterday that we are looking at other resettlement options... This is before the courts. I am not going to comment on a matter that is before the courts, so I’ll leave it there. The minister for trade, tourism and investment, Dan Tehan, is backing up the prime minister’s criticism of China this morning, discussing the need for global rules of trade. He is speaking with ABC News Breakfast now: What the PM is putting out quite clearly is that we do have a heightened strategic competition in the Indo-Pacific and it never has been a more important time for liberal democracies to get together and make sure that we are 100% becoming a rules-based order and to make sure when it comes to global trade that those global trade rules are there, that they are being adhered to and also, as with set new rules, it is bodies like the World Trade Organization that are setting those rules. It never has been a more important time to having all countries setting rules and making sure those rules are adhered to. More on ABC’s reports about today’s Melbourne lockdown announcements: We are hanging out on the blog this morning, but about 9pm last night we weren’t so sure there would even be a website to have a blog on today! Yep, let’s talk about the massive global server outage that took down most of Australia’s major news sites last night. Alex Hern and Dan Sabbagh have the details: One of the world’s biggest web outages should act as a “wake-up call” that internet infrastructure has become dangerously over-centralised and lacks resilience, security experts have warned. An unexplained configuration error at a single infrastructure provider, Fastly, which handles 10% of the world’s internet traffic, was enough to render major websites and services inoperable for almost an hour. Online businesses including Reddit, Amazon, Twitch, Spotify and Hulu were knocked offline, as was the Guardian’s website, the BBC, the New York Times, and CNN. National governments were also caught up: gov.uk was unavailable, making a host of government services inaccessible include the Covid vaccines booking site, as was the website for the White House. The affected sites all used Fastly as a content delivery network, a service intended to provide greater reliability and performance for heavily trafficked websites. You can read the full link below on our, thankfully functional, website: This hasn’t been independently confirmed by Guardian Australia but here is what the ABC is reporting will be the likely announcements on the end of Melbourne lockdown. It’s been suggested the city will move to a 25km travel bubble, with density limits in hospitality venues, and all students returning to the classroom. The ABC suggests that senior minister are meeting this morning to finalise plans so this could still change between now and the press conference. Scott Morrison is resisting international pressure to lock in more ambitious climate commitments, declaring Australia opposes setting targets for certain parts of the economy or “false deadlines for phasing out specific energy sources”. Before he sets off for the G7 summit in the UK later this week, the prime minister will use a foreign policy speech to say that “ambition alone won’t solve the problem of actually reducing emissions”. Morrison is also expected to characterise carbon border tariffs – an idea that is gathering momentum in international discussions as a way to avoid heavy-emitting industries shifting to countries with less ambitious climate commitments – as a “combative” protectionist measure. In an address to a thinktank in Perth on Wednesday, Morrison is expected to address tensions with China, saying Australia is “far from isolated” despite Beijing rolling out a series of trade actions against Australian export sectors over the past year. You can read more about Morrison’s upcoming G7 trip below: Hello, and a very good morning to you all. It’s Matilda Boseley here to take you through the news of Wednesday. First things first, we will likely get an update on the Melbourne lockdown today, with the current restrictions notionally slated to end at midnight tomorrow. Yesterday the acting premier, James Merlino, suggested that, barring any dramatic changes on Wednesday and Thursday, Melbourne was “on track” to ease restrictions at the end of the city’s second week of lockdown. We are still ... working through all the elements. It is a day-by-day, hour-by-hour analysis about how we are tracking … We remain on track to provide that easing of restrictions to all Victorians. But Merlino also flagged that this would not mean those living in the city could suddenly begin travelling around the state freely again, saying the bubble around Melbourne “will extend beyond any announcements that we will make later in the week”. This means we will be keeping a very close eye on today’s Victorian numbers, which are usually published around 9am, and I’ll bring you all the updates when the acting premier (presumably) appears before the media later this morning. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, will deliver a major foreign policy speech today ahead of a trip to the United Kingdom, where he will be a guest at the G7 meeting of world economic powers. Australia isn’t important enough to be an official member of this exclusive club, but countries like the US, Japan, Germany and the UK sometimes let us tag along like you would a younger sibling to a house party. But before Morrison jumps on a plane he will tell Perth’s USAsia Centre that regional infrastructure that comes with onerous conditions or is too expensive isn’t worth having.

But it wasn’t,” <strong>Damon Hewitt</strong>, the president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, told the Guardian. “This relationship that we are continuing to build is bigger, so we were committed to this not being a tense, bombthrowing meeting.”<br></p> <p>Manchin too said the meeting was constructive, though he remained unmoved.<br></p> <p>“I don’t think anybody changed positions on that. We’re just learning where everybody’s coming from,” he said.<br></p> <p>The meeting underscores the enormous power Manchin has over the future on major civil rights bills, as well as virtually every other element of the Democratic agenda.

His clock is the long game.”<br></p> <p>“People may say he’s angling for this or that, what he can get for his state. Maybe some of that is true, I don’t know.

She said today that she plans to, and has visited the border before. But, she said, “Let’s talk about what’s going on in the places that are causing the issue at the border,” she said. “I think it’s shortsighted for any of us who are in the business of problem-solving to suggest we’re only going to respond to the reaction as opposed to addressing the cause.” Harris also announced a $130m investment “that we are going to dedicate to the labor reform movement here in Mexico”. She and Biden, she added, “are proud of the fact that we will be the most pro-union administration”. The investment will go to help strengthen labor standards in Mexico, address worker safety and child labor, the vice-president said. Harris, who took her first foreign trip as vice-president this week to Guatemala and Mexico City, said the trip was a “success”. She was there as an emissary for the administration on immigration and the conditions at the US-Mexico border. Earlier today, she met with the Mexican president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, to discuss efforts to combat human trafficking and manage migration, as well as economic goals. Yesterday, she stirred up criticism and controversy after she told undocumented migrants to “not come” to the US. “If we are to address the issues that address the southern Border of the United States,” she said, “we have to have the ability to address the root causes of why people leave.” “I want to be very clear that the problem at the border in large part, if not entirely, stems from the problems in these countries,” she said, referring to Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and other countries that migrants are fleeing. The Senate has passed a bipartisan bill designed to boost US competitiveness with China, 68-32. The legislation includes massive investment in American semiconductor manufacturing, robotics research, quantum computing and other technology – in an effort to counter China’s rise as an economic and geopolitical power. It includes $10bn over five years to create regional tech hubs in rural areas, and it requires that iron, steel and other products used in American infrastructure projects are manufactured domestically. It’s a rare bill that was supported by both majority leader Chuck Schumer and minority leader Mitch McConnell – demonstrating that one-upping China can unite lawmakers across party lines. The bill will still need to pass through the House before it becomes law – and it may face some resistance there from lawmakers concerned that it focuses too much on investing in emerging technologies, rather than research and technology to address climate change, cybersecurity and other pressing issues. The Senate confirmed Biden’s first two judicial nominees today, with some Republican support. The appointments are the first step for Biden in working to rebalance the courts after Republicans during the Trump administration raced to appoint more than 220 conservative judges, including three supreme court justices. “I want to convey my sincere gratitude to the Senate for confirming Julien X Neals as a judge for the US district court for the district of New Jersey and Regina M Rodriguez as a judge for the US district court for the district of Colorado, both with bipartisan support,” Biden said in a statement. Biden and Democrats have made it a big priority to appoint even more nominees in the coming weeks, with the goal of confirming “the most judges by July of the first year of a president’s first term in over 50 years”, Biden said. Bill Cassidy, a Republican senator of Louisiana, was one of the members of the moderate bipartisan group working on a new infrastructure proposal. Biden spoke with him, as well as Democrats Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona today, in hopes of reaching a deal even as he travels to Europe this week for the G7 summit. “The president said that he would be in contact with members of the group by phone while in Europe,” Psaki said. A group of moderate lawmakers led Republican Mitt Romney, of Utah, had been working on an alternative bipartisan plan. Biden will keep working with this group, in hopes of getting a deal through, Psaki said. That group hopes to win over 20 centrists to back a compromised plan – one that could cost about half of Biden’s most recent $1.7tn proposal. The plan could be closer to what Biden and most Democrats have backed than the proposal that Capito brought. A major point of contention in the $928bn Republican offer that Biden rejected was that it avoided new spending by dipping into coronavirus relief funds. While Democrats would prefer to raise the corporate tax rate, Republicans have rejected the tactic. According to press secretary Jen Psaki, the president’s efforts to negotiate a bipartisan infrastructure plan that is “responsive to the country’s pressing infrastructure needs” has hit an impasse. Biden informed Republican senator Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, who has been the senate Republican liaison on infrastructure, “that the latest offer from her group did not, in his view, meet the essential needs of our country to restore our roads and bridges, prepare us for our clean energy future, and create jobs”, Psaki said in a statement. “While he was willing to reduce his plan by more than $1 trillion, the Republican group had increased their proposed new investments by only $150 billion.” Capito signaled that she didn’t have much more to offer in terms of a plan that Republicans and Democrats could get behind. “While I appreciate President Biden’s willingness to devote so much time and effort to these negotiations, he ultimately chose not to accept the very robust and targeted infrastructure package, and instead, end our discussions,” she said. Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats are also working on a plan to pass an infrastructure measure via the reconciliation process, which would circumvent the need for bipartisan agreement. Even though Senator Joe Manchin faces pressure for his refusal to back a sweeping voting bill, there was a calm atmosphere when he met with several of the US’ leading civil rights groups on Tuesday to discuss the bill. “It was entirely constructive. It wasn’t tense in the least. Look, if there was going to be a tense meeting ever, this one was set up to be that. But it wasn’t,” Damon Hewitt, the president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, told the Guardian. “This relationship that we are continuing to build is bigger, so we were committed to this not being a tense, bombthrowing meeting.” Manchin too said the meeting was constructive, though he remained unmoved. “I don’t think anybody changed positions on that. We’re just learning where everybody’s coming from,” he said. The meeting underscores the enormous power Manchin has over the future on major civil rights bills, as well as virtually every other element of the Democratic agenda. Advocates must seek a way to show Manchin the urgency of acting without alienating them from their cause. Chuck Schumer, the senate majority leader, has pledged there will be a vote on the For the People Act at the end of June. He said Tuesday there could be changes to the bill before then – a tacit acknowledgment the current bill may be unfeasible given Manchin’s objections. Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois, said Tuesday Democrats were expecting Manchin to provide a specific list of his qualms with the bill. Asked whether Manchin understood the urgent need to act on voting rights now, Hewitt said: “Urgency, I’m not sure if he connects with because he’s on a different clock. His clock is the long game.” “People may say he’s angling for this or that, what he can get for his state. Maybe some of that is true, I don’t know. But he came across as deeply principled. That he believes what he says and he says what he believes. And we may just simply disagree,” he added. Republican West Virginia Senator Shelley Moore Capito is saying that Joe Biden has ended infrastructure negotiations with Republicans. This comes after press secretary Jen Psaki said today that “the train is moving on several tracks” regarding the negotiations. Here is Capito’s statement: Actress and activist Alyssa Milano is considering running for Congress in 2024, in a bid to flip a Republican stronghold in California blue, the Hill is reporting. Milano said she splits her time between Ventura county and Truckee in California’s 4th congressional district, which has been represented by Republican Tom McClintock since he was first elected in 2008. “It’s going to take someone with, I think, name recognition and deep pockets to be able to run against McClintock, and so I’m considering it,” Milano told the Hill. “I’m basically gathering information right now, speaking to different consultants, speaking to the community.” Vice-President Kamala Harris will host all 24 female senators for dinner next week, bringing back what were once regular bipartisan get-togethers, Politico reports. The quarterly dinners were started by former Democratic Maryland Senator Barbara Mikulski and Republican Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, according to Politico, hosted at the home of a different senator every six week, with each lawmaker bringing a different dish. Supposedly, however, the dinners became less regular after Mikulski retired in 2017 - and with the aggressive campaigning against former Republican New Hampshire Senator Kelly Ayotte in 2016 and Republican Maine Senator Susan Collins in 2020. Adding to tensions, in 2020, a record four femaleDemocratic senators were running against each other for president - Harris, New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren. “The sisterhood has certainly faded,” an unnamed source told Politico. It’s been a lively morning and we have more news to bring you in the coming hours, so do stay tuned. Here are the main developments of the day in US political news so far. Vice president Kamala Harris is coming in for some criticism from progressives and others both on the likely effectiveness of her visit to Guatemala and Mexico this week and attempts to tackle the “root causes” of migration from the region to the US, and her blunt message yesterday aimed at migrants telling them simply: “Do not come”. White House press sec Jen Psaki defended Harris at the briefing today. The White House is still putting a brave face on the gut-punch by Joe Manchin in his West Virginia op-ed saying he wouldn’t support either the For the People voting rights Act legislation stuck in Congress or busting the filibuster to get more Biden bills through. Psaki said folks were encouraged by talks today between Manchin and civil rights leaders. This despite those talks not yielding any concrete agreement, compromise or shift in positions, apparently. The first – and possibly the last – bipartisan review into the 6 January insurrection at the US Capitol uncovered failings on all fronts before the attack as well as breakdowns between intelligence agencies and a lack of preparation by the Capitol police. White House press secretary Jen Psaki received multiple questions about Vice-President Kamala Harris and her first foreign trip. To recap, Harris has received some criticism for bluntly telling migrants “do not come” to the US and then for not visiting the border. Psaki reiterated that Harris’s assignment “was to work with countries and leaders within the northern triangle to address root causes, to address corruption, to make sure we’re working together to address humanitarian concerns.” “I think at some point she may go to the border, we’ll see,” Psaki said. “But she’s in the northern triangle now to have discussions with leaders, with community leaders, with civil society leaders, with the embassy on how we can work together.” Psaki acknowledged a critical tweet from progressive Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez that pointed out that seeking asylum at the US border is “a 100% legal method of arrival”. “What the vice president was simply conveying is that there’s more work to be done, that we don’t have these systems in place yet, that it’s still a dangerous journey, as we’ve said many times from here and from many forums before,” Psaki said. “We need more time to get the work done to get asylum processing to where it should be.” Much of the backlash over Harris’s comments over not visiting the border have come from Republicans. Psaki addressed this, saying, “we’re not taking advice from former President Trump, or most of the Republicans who are criticizing us on this, given that they were all sitting there while we created this problem that we walked into at the border and the movement of migration that has been growing in the last year,” she said. A reporter asked about some progressives referring to Joe Manchin as the “new Mitch McConnell”. Jen Psaki responded: “We’ll leave the name-calling to others.” In today’s White House press briefing, White House press secretary Jen Psaki was asked about voting rights legislation, in light of senator Joe Manchin and his weekend oped about his decision not to vote for the For The People Act. In response to a question about whether Joe Biden would push for pursuing the John Lewis Act before the For The People Act, she responded, “I think he is quite open to what Democratic leadership feels is the viable path forward.” She followed up by saying it was “encouraging” to see Manchin meet with civil rights leaders this morning, and reiterated the administration’s support for voting rights legislation. “We will continue to press for federal action to move forward on a bill that the president would love to sign into law,” Psaki said. “We certainly know we cannot do that with a magic wand, that is not how democracy works, for good reason. But the president also signed this executive action early on, a very expansive and powerful executive action, because he didn’t want to delay a moment in ensuring that we were taking more steps to assist states to modernize vote.gov, to increase federal employees’ access to voting, to analyze barriers to voting for people.” West Virginia senator Joe Manchin left his meeting with civil rights leaders unmoved on his decision to oppose the sweeping For the People Act, but called the conversation constructive. “We had a constructive conversation. I think everybody pretty much knows the importance of what we’re doing,” Manchin said. “And I think I’m very much concerned about our democracy, protecting people’s voting rights.” Civil rights leaders that met with Manchin - NAACP President Derrick Johnson, the Rev Al Sharpton, National Urban League President Marc Morial, National Council of Negro Women President Johnnetta Cole, Lawyers’ Committee President Damon Hewitt, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights interim President Wade Henderson and the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation President Melanie Campbell - were measured in their response. The readout from the meeting read: In a very constructive meeting today, national civil rights leaders met with Senator Manchin to share our policy priorities and concerns related to voting rights and police reform. Specifically, the groups expressed their collective views on the need for Congress to pass both the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, and the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. The two voting rights bills are a top priority and essential to protect the freedom to vote. There continues to be an unprecedented partisan wave of state legislative proposals that are aimed at denying the right to vote — particularly for Black and Brown people. The leaders also conveyed to Senator Manchin that a minority of senators must not be able to abuse the filibuster to impede much needed progress. Congress must act so all Americans have meaningful access to the ballot. Vice-President Kamala Harris, who has been taking some criticism for her blunt speech in Guatemala to Central American migrants to “do not come” to US, is now getting some backlash from Republicans for an NBC interview she did on this same trip. Reminder: Joe Biden tasked Harris in March with efforts to stem migration at the US-Mexican border. On her first foreign trip, NBC’s Lester Holt asked if she had any plans to visit the border. “At some point, you know, we are going to the border,” Harris said. “We’ve been to the border. So this whole, this whole, this whole thing about the border. We’ve been to the border. We’ve been to the border.” “You haven’t been to the border,” Holt responded. “I, and I haven’t been to Europe. And I mean, I don’t - I don’t understand the point that you’re making,” Harris said with a laugh. Harris has maintained that her focus is on “the root causes of migration.” “I care about this and I care about what’s happening at the border. I’m in Guatemala because my focus is dealing with the root causes of migration,” Harris said. “There may be some who think that that is not important, but it is my firm belief that if we care about what’s happening at the border, we better care about the root causes and address them.” Vice-President Kamala Harris is in Mexico now, meeting with Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador. Reminder that the Senate report on the Capitol attack comes just weeks after Republicans blocked efforts to establish a bipartisan, 9/11-style commission to investigate the events of 6 January. The first – and possibly the last – bipartisan review into the 6 January attack on the US Capitol uncovered failings on all fronts before the attack as well as breakdowns between intelligence agencies and a lack of preparation by the Capitol police. “This report is important in the fact that it allows us to make some immediate improvements to the security situation here in the Capitol,” said Michigan senator Gary Peters, the chairman of the homeland security and governmental affairs committee, which conducted the investigation along with the Senate rules committee. “But it does not answer some of the bigger questions that we need to face, quite frankly, as a country and as a democracy.” Read more about the report’s findings here: Joseph Blount Jr, president and CEO of the Colonial Pipeline Company, is testifying before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee about the ransomware attack last month that knocked out gas delivery up and down the East Coast. The Justice Department announced yesterday that it recovered $2.3m of the roughly $4.4m that the company paid in a cryptocurrency ransom to a gang of criminal hackers known as DarkSide. It appears the meeting between Joe Manchin and civil rights leaders has come to an end. In more voting rights news: following the Sunday oped in which Democratic senator Joe Manchin committed against voting for the For The People Act, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is saying the House will move on the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. Some recap: the For The People Act would ensure automatic and same-day registration, place limits on gerrymandering and restore voting rights for felons. The John Lewis Act, named after the late Georgia Democratic congressman, would reauthorize voting protections established in the civil rights era but eliminated by the supreme court in 2013. Manchin said he would support the John Lewis Act. His major concern with the For The People Act is that it was not bipartisan. Pelosi made clear that the John Lewis Act is not a substitute for the For The People Act. Former President Barack Obama went on CNN last night to criticize how Republicans have been “cowed into accepting” a series of positions that “would be unrecognizable and unacceptable even five years ago or a decade ago”. In an interview with Anderson Cooper, Obama spoke of the 6 January attack on the US Capitol: “Suddenly you have large portions of the elected Congress going along with the falsehood that there were problems with the election.” He expressed disappointment in Republican elected officials, saying that he understood that while it was politically difficult to go against the lies and conspiracy theories being peddled among their base, it was the right thing to do. “I didn’t expect that there would be so few people who would say, ‘I don’t mind losing my office because this is too important. America is too important. Our democracy is too important’,” Obama said. “We didn’t see that.” “I’m still the hope and change guy,” Obama said. “My hope is the tides will turn, but that does require each of us to understand that this experiment in democracy is not self-executing. It doesn’t happen just automatically. It happens because each successive generation says ‘these values, these truths, we hold self-evident. This is important. We’re going to invest in it and sacrifice for it, even when it’s not politically convenient’.” Vice-President Kamala Harris travels to Mexico today to meet with the country’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador. But Harris is already drawing some criticism on her first official foreign trip. In Guatemala yesterday, Harris was blunt in telling would-be migrants “do not come” to the US border. Her spokeswoman, Symone Sanders, appeared to try to soften that statement today: The Guardian’s Julian Borger looks into some other questions raised by the measures Harris announced in Guatemala: Hello, live blog readers. Hope you’re all doing well. Two days after publishing an op ed on why he won’t vote for voting rights legislation for which he was a key vote, Democratic West Virginia senator Joe Manchin will meet with critics on the left today. Black and civil rights leaders have long fought against what many Democrats have categorized as Republican efforts to restrict voter access in communities of color. And they’re not happy. Manchin’s decision leave Democrats scrambling on what to do next on the For the People Act, which would ensure automatic and same-day registration, place limits on gerrymandering and restore voting rights for felons. It comes as Joe Biden said he would “fight like heck” for voting protections, putting Vice-President Kamala Harris in charge of the White House’s efforts.

At the weekend, the UK prime minister said he would urge the G7 leaders to vaccinate the world against Covid by the end of next year.</p> <p>But is this feasible? That rather depends on your definition. No country will vaccinate every adult. Vaccinating enough to achieve herd immunity, which could be 60% or 70%, is the real aim. It is possible to achieve that by December 2023, say experts, but only if the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/g7\">G7</a> leading economies move immediately to make it happen.</p> <p>The Covax scheme under the UN umbrella should have been the route to vaccination for low-income countries. It was designed as their lifeline. Covax signed contracts with manufacturers to buy 2bn doses by the end of this year. But it is stymied. Its main supplier is the Serum Institute of India, which is now churning out vaccines in response to the terrible surge in domestic cases and deaths and will not be able to fulfil its contracts to Covax or individual countries before the end of the year.</p> <p>Dr Bruce Aylward, senior adviser to the director general of the World Health Organization, who is heavily involved in the vaccine efforts, said: “This is where the UK becomes really important and the G7, because right now we’ve got this gap of death. In June, July, August, September, there’s no vaccine out there for love nor money, in terms of being able to procure it.”</p> <p><strong>Read more of Sarah Boseley’s analysis here: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/jun/08/can-we-vaccinate-the-world-against-covid-by-the-end-of-2022\">Can we vaccinate the world against Covid by the end of 2022?</a></strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/jun/08/can-we-vaccinate-the-world-against-covid-by-the-end-of-2022\">Can we vaccinate the world against Covid by the end of 2022?</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60bf09cc8f08336d75f063b9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-08T06:14:13.214Z\">7.14am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The president of the <strong>Tokyo 2020</strong> organising committee, <strong>Seiko Hashimoto,</strong> is speaking this morning, and she is setting out some of the procedures that will be undertaken to try to keep the games safe.</p> <p>So far, she’s said that media will not be able to use shared accommodation, and that the media will be GPS-tracked to ensure they don’t go into unauthorised areas.

In the meantime you can read all our coronavirus coverage here. And these were the main developments in the past 24 hours: The US and the European Union are expected to support a renewed push into investigating the origins of Covid-19 after conflicting assessments about where the outbreak started, according to Bloomberg News. Washington is also forming working parties with Brussels, Canada, and Mexico to determine how best to safely restart international travel. It came as the World Travel and Tourism Council said the UK government had to scrap its traffic light system for travel because it had “wreaked havoc”. Portugal will allow vaccinated US tourists into the country, Reuters reports. “We are in a position to approve the opening of non-essential travel and flights to people from the US to Portugal as long as they have a vaccination certificate,” economy minister Pedro Siza Vieira, cited by Portuguese radio Renascenca, said. Vaccine passports will be used for the first time at UK sporting events for England’s Euro 2020 group games at Wembley stadium, with those not fully vaccinated able to show proof of a negative lateral flow test taken within the previous 48 hours. World Bank president David Malpass said the institution does not support waiving intellectual property rights for Covid-19 vaccines at the World Trade Organization, claiming it is out of concern that it would hamper innovation in the pharmaceuticals sector. South Africa’s president Cyril Ramaphosa placed the country’s health minister on “special leave” over alleged links to a corruption scandal involving coronavirus communications funding. Pfizer is to begin testing its Covid-19 vaccine on a larger cohort of thousands of children under 12 years old in the US, Finland, Poland and Spain after selecting a lower dose of the shot in an earlier stage of the trial. A top White House official has urged state governors to work with the US Food and Drug Administration to extend the shelf life of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s Covid vaccine as millions of unused doses nationwide near expiration. Many thousands of vaccine doses have been destroyed in African countries after exceeding their expiry dates amid a reluctance to be inoculated and a lack of medical infrastructure, while some jabs were donated relatively late in their shelf life. Music fans flocked to the first unrestricted European festival since the pandemic began over the weekend at an event in Albania that had 10,000 attendees across four days, with everyone showing proof of a recent negative test. Washington state is to give adults a free cannabis spliff after they receive a Covid jab in an attempt to accelerate vaccination uptake through a promotion coined “Joints for Jabs” by the state’s liquor and cannabis board. US president Joe Biden’s Indo-Pacific policy chief said he was “relatively confident” a target for the production of a billion vaccine doses for the region by the end of 2022 would be met, despite the Covid-19 crisis in India, where they are due to be made. Asked at an event hosted by the Center for a New American Security think tank if he expected a delay in the four-nation plan, Kurt Campbell said Washington had been in close consultation with India and others involved in the project, Reuters reports. “Obviously, this is an extremely difficult period for Indian friends. The United States has tried to stand with Delhi and to bring others, both in the private and public sector, to support them,” he said. “Our discussions with both our partners in the private sector, and also in government, suggest that we are - knock on wood - still on track for 2022.” Brazil has had 52,911 new cases of coronavirus reported in the past 24 hours and 2,378, the country’s health ministry said. The South American country has now registered 17,037,129 cases since the pandemic began, while the official death toll has risen to 476,792, according to ministry data, Reuters reports. Uruguay released data on the impact of Sinovac Biotech’s Covid-19 vaccine among its population that showed it was more than 90% effective in preventing intensive care admissions and deaths. The dose reduced deaths by 95% and intensive care admissions by 92%, and also showed 61% efficacy in cutting coronavirus infections, the government said. A total of 795,684 people – health workers and members of the general population between the ages of 18 and 69 – at least 14 days after receiving their second dose of Sinovac’s CoronaVac were compared with unvaccinated people to determine the real-world vaccine effectiveness, the government said in a report. The government also studied the effectiveness of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine among 162,047 health workers and people over 80. The shot was 94% effective at preventing intensive care unit admissions and deaths, and reduced infections by 78%, the report said. Overall, intensive care hospitalisations and deaths from Covid-19 dropped by more than 90% among Uruguayans who were fully inoculated, the data showed, Reuters reports. The “failed and damaging” traffic light system for international travel must be abandoned if the UK travel and tourism sector is to be saved from total collapse, an industry body warned. World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) said the government must scrap the system which has “wreaked havoc” among consumers and businesses in order to save hundreds of thousands of jobs, PA reports. The risk-based system with red, amber and green ratings for countries around the world determines the quarantine and coronavirus testing requirements people face when returning to the UK. But Portugal being moved from the green to amber caught many holidaymakers by surprise and left thousands of UK tourists scrambling to get home before new quarantine rules came into force on Tuesday morning. The WTTC said that moving to a more transparent and easier to understand system will restore consumer confidence and provide a “much-needed” boost to the travel and tourism sector. It warned that a further 218,000 jobs were at “serious risk” if international travel continued to be off-limits for most of the summer, on top of the 307,000 jobs which were lost in the UK sector last year. The British Olympic Association (BOA) has reacted to speculation that Japan could place the UK on its red list by revealing that 86% of Team GB has already had at least one Covid vaccine – and pledging to do everything possible to keep the local population in Tokyo safe. In a letter to the head of the Tokyo organising committee, Seiko Hashimoto, the BOA chair, Hugh Robertson, said Team GB athletes and staff were “doing everything possible to minimise any risk to the people of Japan” in the lead-up to the Olympic Games. He also promised the hosts that the BOA would “do everything we can to get the entire team fully vaccinated before we depart for Japan”. The US administered 303,923,667 doses of Covid-19 vaccines and distributed 372,100,285 doses in the country as of Tuesday morning, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Those figures are up from the 302,851,917 vaccine doses the CDC said had gone into arms by 7 June out of 371,520,735 doses delivered, Reuters reports. The agency said 171,731,584 people had received at least one dose while 140,441,957 people are fully vaccinated as of Tuesday. Brazil’s government will need at least 11bn reais ($2.2bn) in extra cash to extend emergency cash transfers to the poor for two or three months until the Covid-19 outbreak is under control, economy minister Paulo Guedes said. The monthly cost of the programme is about 9bn reais, so a two-month extension would cost 18bn reais, Guedes said, adding that the government already has an unspent 7bn left from the previous package that was revived in April, Reuters reports. President Jair Bolsonaro is deciding whether the aid will be extended for two or three months, Guedes said. This will depend on how the pandemic evolves, but even three months should not cause ripples in financial markets, Guedes said. “I wouldn’t expect any noise from the market ... if you spend 11 or 12bn more. That’s reasonable (in view of the pandemic).” The additional funding would come from emergency spending from a parallel budget to combat Covid-19 that is not subject to the government’s spending cap rules. Amid the stress and unknowability of the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic – which continues to wreak daily havoc and decimate arts industries around the world – there was a moment when some Australian musicians actually felt lucky. “A lot of my friends overseas weren’t getting any sort of stimulus or funding from [their] governments, and we were,” recalls Harriette Pilbeam, who records as Hatchie. After months of lobbying, the state and federal governments had begun drip-feeding the industry with rescue packages, and some musicians found themselves eligible for fortnightly jobkeeper supplements (although many working behind the scenes were not). “We were so grateful to be here – for [nearly] a year, we thought ‘God, we’re so lucky’,” she says. “It felt like it would be silly [to complain] while everyone else was so much worse off.” Fast-forward to June 2021, and that moment has passed. Where Australian musicians may once have felt protected from the worst of the global crisis, they now feel left behind by a government that has botched the vaccine rollout, scrapped jobkeeper, and allowed sporting matches to continue while the music equivalents – stadium shows and festivals – have been cancelled repeatedly, often with no insurance. The US is forming expert working groups with Canada, Mexico, the European Union and the UK to determine how best to safely restart travel after 15 months of pandemic restrictions, a White House official said. Another US official said an announcement expected on Tuesday indicated the administration will not move quickly to lift orders that bar people from much of the world from entering the US because of the time it will take for the groups to do their work, Reuters reports. “While we are not reopening travel today, we hope that these expert working groups will help us use our collective expertise to chart a path forward, with a goal of reopening international travel with our key partners when it is determined that it is safe to do so,” the White House official said. They added: “Any decisions will be fully guided by the objective analysis and recommendations by public health and medical experts.” Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernandez thanked the Mexican government for agreeing to donate 100,000 Covid-19 vaccines, as he seeks to inoculate the population of the Central American country against coronavirus, Reuters reports. Hernandez, in a tweet, also thanked El Salvador and Israel for helping his country secure vaccine doses. Hundreds of UK passengers on a cruise ship sailing around the country have been told they will not be allowed to disembark when they arrive in Scotland on Wednesday. The MSC Virtuosa left Liverpool on Tuesday and was due to dock at Greenock on Wednesday at about 9.30am, departing at 8pm the same day, PA reports. The domestic seven-night cruise is then due to drop anchor at Belfast, Southampton and the Isle of Portland before returning to Greenock and with a final stop at Liverpool the following day. However the Scottish Passenger Agents’ Association, the professional body for travel agents and the sector in Scotland, has seen a copy of an email sent to current passengers by the cruise operator. It says: “Due to the latest Scottish Government Covid 19 restrictions and regulations ... we are sorry to inform you that the port call of Greenock has been cancelled. “No guests are allowed to embark or disembark ... This decision has been made by the Scottish Government and is out of our control.” The US and the European Union are expected to support a renewed push into investigating the origins of Covid-19 after conflicting assessments about where the outbreak started, according to a document seen by Bloomberg News. Portugal will allow vaccinated US tourists into the country, Reuters reports. “We are in a position to approve the opening of non-essential travel and flights to people from the US to Portugal as long as they have a vaccination certificate,” economy minister Pedro Siza Vieira, cited by Portuguese radio Renascenca, said. Vaccine passports will be used for the first time at UK sporting events for England’s Euro 2020 group games at Wembley stadium, with those not fully vaccinated able to show proof of a negative lateral flow test taken within the previous 48 hours. World Bank president David Malpass said the institution does not support waiving intellectual property rights for Covid-19 vaccines at the World Trade Organization, claiming it is out of concern that it would hamper innovation in the pharmaceuticals sector. South Africa’s president Cyril Ramaphosa placed the country’s health minister on “special leave” over alleged links to a corruption scandal involving coronavirus communications funding. Pfizer is to begin testing its Covid-19 vaccine on a larger cohort of thousands of children under 12 years old in the US, Finland, Poland and Spain after selecting a lower dose of the shot in an earlier stage of the trial. A top White House official has urged state governors to work with the US Food and Drug Administration to extend the shelf life of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s Covid vaccine as millions of unused doses nationwide near expiration. Many thousands of vaccine doses have been destroyed in African countries after exceeding their expiry dates amid a reluctance to be inoculated and a lack of medical infrastructure, while some jabs were donated relatively late in their shelf life. Music fans flocked to the first unrestricted European festival since the pandemic began over the weekend at an event in Albania that had 10,000 attendees across four days, with everyone showing proof of a recent negative test. Washington state is to give adults a free cannabis spliff after they receive a Covid jab in an attempt to accelerate vaccination uptake through a promotion coined “Joints for Jabs” by the state’s liquor and cannabis board. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has eased travel recommendations for more than 110 countries and territories including Japan just ahead of the Olympics. Reuters reports: The CDC’s new ratings include 61 nations that were lowered from its highest “Level 4” rating that discouraged all travel to recommending travel for fully vaccinated individuals, the agency confirmed on Tuesday. Another 50 countries and territories have been lowered to “Level 2” or “Level 1,” a CDC spokeswoman said. Countries ranked lowest for Covid-19 risks now include Singapore, Israel, South Korea, Iceland, Belize and Albania. Among those now listed at “Level 3,” are France, Ecuador, Philippines, South Africa, Canada, Mexico, Russia, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, Honduras, Hungary, and Italy. A US State Department official said it was in the process of revising its travel advisory to reflect the CDC changes. As of early Tuesday, the State Department had lowered its ratings on more than 90 countries and territories, including for Japan. Mexico reported 3,449 new confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the country and 262 more fatalities on Tuesday, bringing total infections to 2,438,011 and the death toll to 229,100, according to health ministry data, Reuters reports. Separate government data recently published suggests the real death toll may be at least 60% above the confirmed figure. Rishi Sunak, the UK’s chancellor, is willing to accept a delay of up to four weeks to the final stage of England’s reopening roadmap, the Guardian understands, as the government considers extending restrictions beyond 21 June. Ministers will continue to scrutinise data on cases and hospitalisations over the coming days, with a final decision set to be announced by the prime minister on Monday. From 21 June nightclubs are due to reopen, with the cap on wedding numbers, large-scale events and indoor mixing lifted and guidance on working from home and mask-wearing dropped. A delay in all these changes would infuriate many Conservative backbenchers. On Tuesday the former Tory minister Steve Baker pressed for the date dubbed “freedom day” to go ahead, calling it the “last chance” to save industries such as hospitality, which is calling for the 2-metre distancing rule to be scrapped. Sunak, the chancellor, has in the past been regarded as more keen to lift lockdown constraints than some cabinet colleagues. But a Whitehall source said he was not fixated on the 21 June date and was more concerned that when restrictions are lifted, the move can be permanent. “The Treasury’s main thing is that freedoms are irreversible and businesses have clarity,” the source said. Portugal will allow vaccinated US tourists into the country, Reuters reports. “We are in a position to approve the opening of non-essential travel and flights to people from the US to Portugal as long as they have a vaccination certificate,” economy minister Pedro Siza Vieira, cited by Portuguese radio Renascenca, said. Tourists from the US wanting to travel to Portugal should have received final doses of one of the vaccines approved by the European Medicines Agency at least 14 days before their trip, Siza Vieira said. “I believe that next week we will be able to have this up and running,” he said. Vieira did not give an exact date for when US tourists would be allowed in. The US and the European Union are expected to support a renewed push into investigating the origins of Covid-19 after conflicting assessments about where the outbreak started, according to a document seen by Bloomberg News. In a draft statement the countries hope to adopt at a summit later this month a “call for progress on a transparent, evidence-based, and expert-led WHO-convened phase 2 study on the origins of Covid-19, that is free from interference.” The statement is a draft and could change before the US and European leaders meet in Brussels on 15 June. Almost 12,000 Australians received permission to travel overseas in May, a higher rate than the preceding three months, despite the federal government promising to look at tightening exemptions. According to a Guardian Australia analysis of Australian Border Force (ABF) statistics, some 11,879 citizens and residents were granted exemptions in May, a jump of more than 10% on the average of 10,353 a month between February and April. On 7 May, national cabinet agreed that the commonwealth would “consider tightening ABF outbound travel restrictions for Australians travelling overseas and continue the restrictions in place in respect of applications for travel to high-risk countries”. US secretary of state Antony Blinken cast doubt on the methodology of a report on the origins of Covid-19 cited that concluded the hypothesis of a virus leak from a Chinese lab was plausible. “I saw the report. I think it’s on a number of levels, incorrect,” Blinken told a Senate committee hearing on the State Department’s budget request when asked about the Journal article. The article by the Wall Street Journal cited people familiar with a classified report by a US government national laboratory as saying it concluded that the hypothesis of a virus leak from a Chinese lab in Wuhan was plausible and deserved further investigation, Reuters reports. The report said the study was prepared in May 2020 by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and referred to by State when it conducted an inquiry into the pandemic’s origins during the final months of former President Donald Trump’s administration. Blinken said that to the best of his understanding, the report originated after the Trump administration asked a contractor to look into the origins of the coronavirus that causes Covid-19, with a particular focus on whether it was a result of a lab leak. “That work was done, it was completed, it was briefed, to relevant people in the department. When we came in, we also were made aware of the findings,” Blinken said. “The Trump administration, it’s my understanding, had real concerns about the methodology of that study, the quality of analysis, bending evidence to fit preconceived narrative. That was their concern. It was shared with us.” The branch responsible for the Australian federal government’s aged care Covid-19 response was left with just three staff members at times in the pandemic’s early stages, internal documents show. The Coalition has faced persistent criticism for failing to prepare for Covid-19 in aged care, including from the aged care royal commission, which found its actions were “insufficient to ensure preparedness” in the sector. Vaccine passports will be used for the first time at UK sporting events for England’s Euro 2020 group games at Wembley stadium, with those not fully vaccinated able to show proof of a negative lateral flow test taken within the previous 48 hours.

Vaccine passports will be used for the first time at UK sporting events for England’s Euro 2020 group games at Wembley stadium. However, those not fully vaccinated can show proof of a negative lateral flow test taken within the previous 48 hours, the BBC reports. Uefa, the European football governing body, said UK-based ticket holders aged 11 or over must present evidence of full vaccination, with both doses received at least 14 days before each match. Vaccination status can be displayed through the NHS app. But attendees of matches at Hampden Park will not be required to show proof of vaccination or a negative Covid-19 test. Wembley will host up to of 22,500 people, 25% of its capacity, for England’s group D fixtures against Scotland, Czech Republic, and Croatia. England play the latter on Sunday. A former Slovenian figure skater who competed in the 1992 Winter Olympics has been criminally charged in Manhattan, US, with fraudulently raising $1.6m meant to help small American businesses cope with the pandemic. Reuters has the story: US prosecutors charged Luka Klasinc, 48, with bank fraud and aggravated identity theft related to his alleged use of falsified documents. The fraud count carries a maximum 30-year prison term. Prosecutors said Klasinc owns BOB77 LLC, which has staged ice-themed amusement park events in locations such as Warsaw, Poland; Dusseldorf, Germany; and Ljubljana, Slovenia. According to court papers, BOB77 received $1.6 million of US small Business Administration (SBA) “economic injury disaster loans” from July to September 2020, when there were also many wire transfers to international recipients from its accounts. After Klasinc’s bank froze the accounts on suspicion of fraud, Klasinc allegedly provided a falsified letter on SBA letterhead to “verify” the funds’ legitimacy. Klasinc flew in from Istanbul on 31 May and visited the bank three times to access the funds but was denied, and the bank alerted law enforcement, prosecutors said. World Bank president David Malpass has said the institution does not support waiving intellectual property rights for Covid-19 vaccines at the World Trade Organization out of concern that it would hamper innovation in the pharmaceuticals sector. As WTO negotiations over the proposed waiver resumed in Geneva, Malpass was asked whether he supports a potential vaccine IP waiver, which India, South Africa and other emerging market countries argue is needed to expand vaccine access He said: “We don’t support that, for the reason that it would run the risk of reducing the innovation and the R&amp;D in that sector.” The comment puts Malpass, a Trump administration nominee, at odds with the Biden administration, which is supporting text-based WTO negotiations for vaccine intellectual property rights, led by US trade representative Katherine Tai. Major vaccine makers and the pharmaceutical industries have opposed the waiver. However, Malpass reiterated his calls for wealthy countries to quickly donate their excess vaccine doses to the developing world as quickly as possible. Three of the leading Covid vaccine manufacturers have paid out $26bn in dividends and stock buyouts to shareholders in the last year – enough to cover the cost of vaccinating the population of Africa, say campaigners. Conservative backbencher Steve Baker has urged the UK government to press ahead with lifting England’s remaining Covid restrictions on 21 June despite a sharp rise in cases. He claimed that by that date, all over-50s and vulnerable younger adults should have been given the opportunity to receive two doses of Covid vaccine. These groups represent about 99% of Covid deaths and about 80% of hospitalisations. As of today, according to announcements made by the government, these groups should all have been offered a chance to have had a second dose. It would be helpful for the government to clarify that this has been achieved. If this brilliant milestone isn’t enough to convince ministers that we need to lift all remaining restrictions – especially social distancing requirements – on 21 June, nothing will ever get us out of this. The Dutch government has promised an independent investigation into a supposedly not-for-profit €100m deal to buy facemasks from China last year that ended up making three young entrepreneurs about €20m richer. The investigative website Follow the Money revealed that Sywert van Lienden, 30, a former civil servant turned TV pundit and activist, who co-wrote the manifesto of the Christian Democrat (CDA) party (part of the ruling coalition), netted €9.2m. His two associates, Bernd Damme, and Camille van Gestel, made €5.7m and €5.5m respectively, after launching a not-for-profit foundation amid a barrage of publicity in April 2020, after hospitals and officials warned of a desperate shortage of PPE. A top White House official has urged state governors to work with the US Food and Drug Administration to extend the shelf life of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s Covid vaccine as millions of unused doses nationwide near expiration. “I would encourage every governor who has doses that they worry may be expiring to work with the FDA directly on the proper storage procedures as they continue to examine processes that will allow them to potentially last longer,” White House Covid-19 Advisor Andy Slavitt said on a press call today. AP reports that Slavitt added that the FDA is working on plans to safely store the unused J&amp;J vaccines. The pharmaceutical giant has said it is conducting ongoing stability assessment studies that could allow it to extend the expiration dates for its one-shot vaccine. Safety concerns about J&amp;J’s shot and flagging demand for vaccinations have left close to half of the 21 million doses the company has produced for the US sitting unused. Demand for all the vaccines has slowed since mid-April, but the drop has been significantly steeper for the J&amp;J shot. Reuters reported that at least 13 lots of J&amp;J shots have expiration dates of 27 June or earlier. It is not clear how many doses that reflects. J&amp;J has another 100 million doses on hand but shipment timing is uncertain. Starbucks has said it will start accepting reusable cups from customers in the US later this month, more than a year after stopping their use due to the pandemic. Reuters reports that coffee chains had been encouraging the use of reusable cups and thermos flasks to lower their high carbon footprint before the health crisis caused them to shift to disposables last year. The rollout of Covid-19 vaccines in the US has, however, allowed restaurants to restart dining rooms and apparel sellers such as Kohl’s Corp and Target Corp to reopen their fitting rooms. Starbucks said it would also adopt a contactless method that would eliminate any shared touchpoints between its baristas and customers bringing their personal cups. Last week, the coffee chain announced it would offer reusable cups in stores across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa by 2025. The confirmed number of Covid-19 patients in intensive care in Northern Ireland has dropped to zero. PA has the story: Deputy first minister Michelle O’Neill said it is the first time the number has been zero in ten months. O’Neill expressed her thanks to healthcare workers and also encouraged the public to continue playing their part. “For the first time in 10 months in the North, there are zero Covid patients in intensive care,” O’Neill tweeted. “A massive thank you to our healthcare workers for their efforts - let’s keep playing our part and making progress.” Today, there were 15 confirmed Covid-positive patients in the region’s hospitals. None were described in Department of Health data as being confirmed in ICU beds. No further deaths of patients who had previously tested positive for the virus were notified on Tuesday, however another 81 cases were confirmed. AP has this dispatch from the White House briefing room yesterday, where for the first time in 449 days reporters crammed into every seat for the daily briefing. Coronavirus restrictions had kept one of the most recognised rooms in the US government almost empty. But mass vaccinations allowed reporters to first doff their masks on 13 May and then nearly a month later to gather in a pack of raised hands, shouting, hard-eyed stares and the occasional grimace. “Hope everyone’s cozy,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said at she stepped to the lectern. Forty-nine journalists sat elbow-to-elbow in blue seats, while others stood on the edges. The loudspeaker before the briefing told reporters not to block the aisle, but no one budged. The questions covered a wide range — a sign that there are still plenty of tensions, emergencies and unknowns to consume any administration’s time. The topics included Russia, China, Afghanistan, cyberattacks, infrastructure, voting rights, vaccinations and Supreme Court decisions. Presidents might campaign on policies and promises, but most administrations must deal with a daily degree of chaos, sometimes of their own making. National security adviser Jake Sullivan also took the podium at Monday’s briefing to preview the president’s first foreign trip, which will begin this week with a G7 summit meeting in the UK. South Africa’s president Cyril Ramaphosa has placed the country’s health minister on “special leave” over alleged links to a corruption scandal involving coronavirus communications funding. Graft investigators opened a probe into two of Zweli Mkhize’s close aides last month. The pair, Mkhize’s former spokeswoman and ex-personal assistant, are accused of pocketing public funds set aside to fund South Africa’s coronavirus response plan. AFP reports that around 90 million rand ($6.6 million) were allegedly syphoned off using a front company, Digital Vibes, awarded a 150 million rand tender in March 2020 to handle the health ministry’s communications campaign. Ramaphosa has “placed minister of health Dr Zweli Mkhize on special leave,” the presidency said in a statement. It said the leave period “will enable the minister to attend to allegations and investigations concerning contracts” between his department and Digital Vibes. Revelations about the alleged mishandling of coronavirus funds surfaced last year and have led investigators to believe that billions of rands have fallen into the hands of politically connected companies, sparking public outrage. Mkhize has previously denied any involvement with Digital Vibes, claiming he had no knowledge of the company or the tender process. He wrote to the ruling African National Congress party last week to request a meeting of its integrity committee to state his case. Ministers are said to be considering delaying the easing of lockdown in England on 21 June for somewhere between two weeks and a month. My colleague Nicola Davis looks at what a delay could mean, and how long it may need to last. In the UK, 6,048 positive coronavirus cases have been confirmed on Tuesday, and 13 further deaths within 28 days of a positive test, according to official data. That brings the UK total deaths to 127,854. Separate figures published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show there have been 153,000 deaths registered in the UK where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate. The number of people who have received the first dose of a vaccine rose to 40,573,517, a rise of 112,941 on the previous day. 28,227,362 were recorded as second doses, an increase of 306,068. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) will give a verdict on the use of Moderna Covid-19 vaccine in 12- to 17-year-olds next month, following an application by the drugmaker. The committee said it would “speed up” assessment of data submitted adding that a delay would happen if the EMA required any additional information. It’s worth bearing in mind the two-dose vaccine is already being used in the EU, the US, and Canada for people over 18 years of age. The company has also sought approval in Canada for use in adolescents and plans for a US application. If approved, the Moderna vaccine would become the second shot to be allowed for use in teenagers in the EU after Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine was approved last month. In England, measures to try to halt the rise of the Delta variant of will cover 10% of England’s population. Health secretary Matt Hancock has announced a “strengthened package of support” to be provided for Greater Manchester and Lancashire, where case numbers remain high. Other areas, such as Bolton, will continue to receive support. Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham stressed this was “not a lockdown” but “advice”. At a press conference he said: “Obviously what we’re seeing here is a localised approach to messaging, more localised support on testing and on tracing and isolation. We are also saying that also should apply to vaccination. “We are not asking for any more vaccine here than our fair share, what we are asking for is the bringing forward of Greater Manchester’s supplies, so that we can run a surge vaccination programme over the next three weeks.” On Monday, Hancock told the House of Commons that out of 12,383 cases of the Delta variant, 464 people went on to seek emergency care and 126 were admitted to hospital. Of these, 83 people were unvaccinated, 28 had one dose of vaccine and just three had had both doses. Pfizer will begin testing its Covid-19 vaccine on a larger cohort of children under 12 years old after selecting a lower dose of the shot in an earlier stage of the trial. The study will enrol up to 4,500 children at more than 90 clinical sites in the US, Finland, Poland, and Spain, the company said. Based on safety, tolerability and the immune response generated by 144 children in a phase I study of the two-dose shot, Pfizer said it will test a dose of 10 micrograms in children between five and 11 years of age. They will also test 3 micrograms for the age group of six months to five years old. The vaccine has been authorised for use in children as young as 12 in Europe, the US and Canada. They receive the same dose as adults: 30 micrograms. Inoculating children and young people is considered a critical step toward reaching “herd immunity” and taming the Covid-19 pandemic. Nearly 7 million teens have received at least one dose of the vaccine in the US, according to the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. The husband and wife team who helped make the first Covid-19 vaccine are contributing to a book about their efforts. BioNTech founders Ugur Sahin and Özlem Türeci, from Germany, are collaborating with Joe Miller of the Financial Times on The Vaccine. Publication of the book is scheduled for 2 November. According to the publishing group St Martin’s, the book will detail how the pair were able to develop a panel of vaccine candidates within a matter of weeks, how they convinced major pharmaceutical companies to support their work, and how in partnership with Pfizer they managed to produce more than 2bn doses for countries around the world. Meanwhile, the Pfizer chairman and CEO, Albert Bourla, is also working on a book, announced last month. Harper Business is publishing Bourla’s Moonshot: Inside Pfizer’s Nine-Month Race to Make the Impossible Possible on 9 November. You can read more about Ugur Sahin and Özlem Türeci here: A dope idea? Washington state is to give adults a free cannabis spliff after they receive a Covid jab in an attempt to accelerate vaccination uptake. The promotion, coined “Joints for Jabs” by the state’s liquor and cannabis board, was announced yesterday and will run until 12 July. Participating cannabis retailers will give the pre-rolled spliffs to those who have received their first or second dose, if they wish to get high. According to the New York Times, 58% of people in Washington have received at least one dose and 49% are fully vaccinated. The state also recently instituted plans to allow a free beer, wine or cocktail to residents with proof of vaccination, the Washington Post reports. Elsewhere in the US, the paper reports that after the pace of vaccinations began to seriously decline in April, states and cities began promotions including a raffle for full college scholarships and lotteries including prizes of $1m of more – with only those who had been vaccinated eligible. Plans to allow an NHS system to extract patient data from doctors’ surgeries in England have been delayed amid concerns around privacy. But Jo Churchill, the public health minister, said the data programme would still go ahead this year. The World Bank has raised its global growth forecast to 5.6% for 2021, marking the strongest recovery from a recession in 80 years due to US stimulus spending and faster growth in China but held back by “highly unequal” access to Covid-19 vaccines. Reuters has the story: The development lender’s latest Global Economic Prospects report showed a 1.5% point increase from forecasts made in January, before the Biden administration took office and enacted a $1.9 trillion US Covid-19 aid package. Since then, vaccines have become much more widely distributed in the US and some other wealthy countries, boosting their output, as forecasts lag for emerging market and low-income countries. “This recovery is uneven and largely reflects sharp rebounds in some major economies - most notably the US, owing to substantial fiscal support - amid highly unequal vaccine access,” the World Bank said in the report. Many emerging market and developing economies were seeing elevated Covid-19 caseloads, obstacles to vaccination and withdrawal of support, the bank said. By 2022, this will leave global output about 2% below pre-pandemic projections, and about two thirds of emerging market economies will still not have made up last year’s per-capita income losses. If vaccine distribution to developing countries can be accelerated, World Bank economist Ayhan Kose said that 2022 global GDP growth, currently forecast at 4.3%, could increase substantially to around 5%. A small addendum on the final paragraph: one wonders to what extent the profits from an acceleration of vaccine distribution to developing countries would further entrench the north-south global divide. Many thousands of vaccine doses have been destroyed in African countries after exceeding their expiry dates amid a reluctance to be inoculated and a lack of medical infrastructure, the BBC reports. Malawi has destroyed almost 20,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, while South Sudan said it would safely dispose of 59,000 doses and hand back another 72,000 to the global Covax scheme for poorer countries. The Democratic Republic of Congo said it could not use most of the 1.7 million AstraZeneca doses it received through Covax, so they were sent to Ghana, Madagascar and elsewhere. Nigeria was also unable to use some doses. Some vaccines are given with a short shelf life before expiry, such as a batch of one million doses South Africa received from India in February with an expiry date of 13 April. However, the the country’s government opted not to use them due to concerns the jabs did not offer sufficient protection from the prevalent Covid variant. Malawi virologist Gama Bandawe told the BBC that mistrust of vaccines has played a role in the country being unable to use all the supplies it has received. A study commissioned by the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention on Covid-19 vaccine perceptions in 15 countries suggests that a significant proportion of people on the continent harbour concerns around vaccine safety. Unions representing teachers and other school staff are calling on the government to reinstate masks in classrooms in England in response to a growing number of Covid outbreaks, particularly among secondary pupils. Authorities in 92 countries shut down 113,000 websites and online marketplaces selling counterfeit or illicit medicines and medical products last month, including vast quantities of fake Covid-19 tests and face masks, Interpol has said. “As the pandemic forced more people to move their lives online, criminals were quick to target these new ‘customers’,” Jurgen Stock, secretary general of the international police agency, said in a statement. AFP reports that unauthorised Covid testing kits accounted for over half of all the medical devices seized from 18-25 May, the agency said, while Italian authorities found more than 500,000 fake surgical masks and 35 machines for their production and packaging. Police arrested 227 people worldwide and recovered pharmaceutical products worth $23m. “Whilst some individuals were knowingly buying illicit medicines, many thousands of victims were unwittingly putting their health and potentially their lives at risk,” Stock said. Fake and illicit drugs were also found concealed in shipments of clothes, jewellery, toys and food. The roughly 9m devices and drugs seized was the highest number since Interpol began coordinating the fake medicine campaigns, known as Pangea operations, in 2008. Researchers in Denmark are using virtual reality to encourage more Covid-19 vaccinations, through a game of manoeuvring through a virus-infected crowd in a city square. In an experiment by the University of Copenhagen, participants wear goggles to play an elderly person crossing the square while avoiding red-clothed by-passers infected with Covid-19. Vaccinated characters dress in blue. “It was fun, definitely. It felt like you were there,” said Adam, a participant who got infected in the game he played in a Copenhagen park. “We know from similar studies that after people went through a virtual reality experience like this, their vaccination intention increases. We have observed this with Covid already,” said Robert Bohm, professor of psychology at the University of Copenhagen, citing a prior online study by the researchers. The World Health Organization estimates that immunisation prevents 4 million to 5 million deaths every year. In February-March, more than a quarter of European Union adults said they would refuse a Covid-19 shot, a survey by the EU agency Eurofound showed. Music fans flocked to the first unrestricted European festival since the pandemic began over the weekend at an event in Albania that had 10,000 attendees across four days. The open-air Unum music festival saw performances by 50 international and local musicians, as people embraced the chance to hear nonstop music for five days at Thrown Sand beach, 75km north-west of the capital, Tirana. AP reports that organisers claimed that everyone at the festival was free of Covid-19. “Once everyone is tested, It’ll be safer among thousands of people inside the festival than it will be outside in the general population,” Grego O’Halloran, the head organiser, told Mixmag ahead of the event. “We went to the Albanian government and said that we have a way of testing people and they were like ‘Alright great, well that sounds good!’ “There will be testing stations all around the city that you can pop in to, or if you’ve got a negative PCR test arriving into Albania that will cover you for a certain period. There’ll be a double check mid-festival to make sure everything is as secure as possible.” The main stage near the beach was on top of a sailboat, while another was under the pine trees close to the beach. Festivalgoers came from all across Europe, even as far away as Uruguay. “[It’s] awesome … crazy … insane to see so many people in one place … [after] sitting in one room in your apartment alone in lockdown,” said one German attendee. The event was possible because of Albania’s low contagion rate. It recorded only two new infections on Saturday. The foreign ministry noted there were no pandemic restrictions for anyone wanting to come to Albania. The motto of the festival was for people to become “one” and unite over music, and some said music was more important than most people realised. “It was necessary for our mental health,” said Ron Kurtolli, a DJ from Kosovo. “People don’t pay much attention to mental health, but it’s really important for the well-being of everything.” Thousands of US families with children in foster care have seen reunifications snarled as courts delayed cases, went virtual or temporarily shut down, according to an Associated Press analysis of child welfare data from 34 states. The decrease in children leaving foster care means families are lingering longer in a system intended to be temporary, as critical services were shuttered or limited. Vulnerable families are suffering long-term and perhaps irreversible damage, experts say, which could leave parents with weakened bonds with their children. The AP’s analysis found at least 8,700 fewer reunifications during the early months of the pandemic compared with the March-to-December period the year before – a decrease of 16%. Adoptions dropped too — by 23%. Overall, at least 22,600 fewer children left foster care compared with 2019. “The systemic problems around racism and poverty in Covid and how people are treated in the child welfare system may be compounding,” said Sharon Vandivere of the group Child Trends, who noted that longer stays in foster care are inherently traumatic and make reunifications less likely. Many more men in India have received Covid-19 vaccines than women, government data shows, highlighting gender disparity in the country’s immunisation drive that has also disadvantaged the rural population. Reuters reports that India has partly or fully vaccinated about 101 million men, nearly 17% more than women. Men account for 54% of the total number of people inoculated, according to the data. Many federally administered regions, the capital Delhi, and big states such as Uttar Pradesh have seen some of the worst inequities. Only Kerala in the south and Chhattisgarh in central India have vaccinated more women than men. “We are noticing that men, especially in towns and villages, prefer to take the vaccine before women as they have to travel for work, while women are relegated to domestic chores,” said Prashant Pandya, medical superintendent at a big government hospital in the western state of Gujarat. India, with a population of 1.3 billion, has about 6% more men than women. Fifteen of the UK’s Nobel prize-winning scientists, economists and peace activists have called on the country to “play a historic role” in removing “artificial” intellectual property barriers that are “restricting” Covid-19 vaccine production. In a letter to the UK prime minister, the Nobel laureates caution that “last year, science was the main barrier to beating this disease; but today, it is inequality”, with highly effective vaccines largely available only to wealthy countries. An intellectual property waiver is “an essential step to increase production”, the letter said, calling for pharmaceutical giants to be forced to share their vaccine technology and know-how through the World Health Organisation’s Covid-19 Technology Access Pool. India and South Africa first proposed a Covid vaccine waiver at the World Trade Organisation eight months ago, with the support of more than 100 mostly low and middle-income countries, but the move was blocked by a small number of rich countries including the US, Japan, the UK, and EU. Sir Richard Roberts, awarded the 1993 Nobel Prize in medicine, said: The scientific case for this is clear. If we allow Covid-19 to spread around the globe for years, not only will millions needlessly die, but the virus will continue to mutate into more virulent strains. That could undo all of our work – including the work of British scientists – in developing effective vaccines and will likely prolong the pandemic for years. We don’t have time for politicking. The intellectual property barriers to vaccine production are hindering local production of vaccines, especially in low and middle income countries, and they must be cleared away. Sir Christopher Pissarides, awarded the 2010 Nobel prize in economic sciences, said: British scientists have created life-saving vaccines that can help save the lives of millions. But it would be a tragedy if in these exceptional times they are locked away and kept secret, shared among only a handful of pharmaceutical companies. Mairead Corrigan-Maguire, awarded the 1976 Nobel peace prize, said: With high vaccination rates in rich countries while low and middle-income nations suffer, we are watching a system of vaccine apartheid develop. There is no justification for the needless loss of life in the months since India and South Africa first requested an intellectual property waiver. These are global public goods, developed largely with public funding; they belong to all of us. Boris Johnson must do what is right and support this waiver, for all of humanity. A host of celebrities including David Beckham, Olivia Colman and Billie Eilish have written to world leaders calling for surplus coronavirus vaccines to be shared with poorer countries. In an open letter, published ahead of the G7 summit on Friday, the Unicef ambassadors said the meeting was a “vital opportunity” for action to be taken. The world has spent a year and a half battling the Covid-19 pandemic, but the virus is still spreading in many countries and producing new variants with the potential to put us all back where we started. This means more school closures, more healthcare disruptions and greater economic fallout - threatening the futures of families and children everywhere. The pandemic will not be over anywhere until it is over everywhere, and that means getting vaccines to every country, as quickly and equitably as possible. This weekend’s G7 summit is a vital opportunity for you to agree the actions that will get vaccines where they are most needed, fast. Other signatories include actors Liam Neeson, Orlando Bloom, Gemma Chan, and Whoopi Goldberg, singers Katy Perry and P!nk, and UK tennis ace Andy Murray. The letter also warned that Covax, the global initiative supporting poorer countries in gaining access to vaccines, is facing a shortfall of 190 million doses. Unicef has proposed that G7 countries should donate 20% of their vaccines between June and August to help address the shortages temporarily. “As a Unicef goodwill ambassador I believe in the crucial benefit of vaccinations,” said former England footballer Beckham. “The pandemic won’t be over until it’s over everywhere, so it’s vital that all communities around the world have fair access to Covid-19 vaccines urgently.” More than 1 million Europeans have received the new EU Covid health certificate being rolled out to unlock travel within the bloc, the European Commission has said. AFP reports: EU justice commissioner Didier Reynders announced the figure to the European parliament ahead of a vote to enshrine the document in law in time for the continent’s summer tourism season. The certificate – showing the bearer’s immunity to Covid-19 either through vaccination or previous infection, or their negative test status – is to be used for intra-EU travel from 1 July. But the commission wants as many EU countries as possible to start earlier. “The more certificates we can already issue, the easier the process will be during the summer - otherwise, we risk a big bang on the first of July, which we cannot afford,” Reynders said. As of today, nine EU countries were already issuing the documents, with more than a million citizens have received such certificates – which can be presented either online or on paper – already. EU lawmakers and capitals also agreed that, when it comes to proof of vaccinations, only the jabs authorised by the European Medicines Agency – so far those from BioNTech/Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson – would be accepted in all EU countries. But individual countries can also decide to accept, for their territory only, others, such as one produced by China, or Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine. To prevent discrimination against the unvaccinated - particularly younger Europeans who have not yet been able to access jabs given in priority to the elderly - much emphasis has also been put on testing. The parliament failed to make Covid tests for travel free of charge, but extracted money and concessions from the European Commission to make them more affordable. As we emerge from a widespread internet outage, a top Japanese virologist and government adviser has said there is a risk of spreading Covid-19 during the Tokyo Olympics. Tohoku University professor Hitoshi Oshitani was an architect of Japan’s “Three Cs” approach to the pandemic, which advises avoiding closed spaces, crowds and close contact situations. He told the Times: The government and the organising committee, including the IOC (International Olympic Committee), keep saying they’re holding a safe Olympics. But everybody knows there is a risk. It’s 100% impossible to have an Olympics with zero risk … of the spread of infection in Japan and also in other countries after the Olympics. There are a number of countries that do not have many cases, and a number that don’t have any variants. We should not make the Olympics [an occasion] to spread the virus to these countries. Already postponed from last year because of the pandemic, a scaled-down version of the Games with no foreign spectators is set to start on 23 July despite public fears the event could spread the coronavirus and drain medical resources. However, a former Olympian turned public health expert, said she believed the Games can be pulled off with an acceptable level of risk. “There will be cases, but having one case or a couple of cases doesn’t mean that it was a failure,” Tara Kirk Sell, a professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told Reuters. Sell, a silver medallist swimmer at the 2004 Games, added: “These Games are very much a symbol of the whole world emerging from this terrible, global pandemic … If we wanted to be as safe as possible, we’d never leave our house.” Amid the outage, my colleague Martin Belam handed over the blog, so it will be me Mattha Busby bringing you global coronavirus updates for the next couple of hours. You may contact me via email on mattha.busby.freelance@guardian.co.uk or on Twitter. Please do get in touch with any tips or thoughts. China has approved the emergency use of a Covid-19 vaccine for those as young as three, according to a spokesperson for Sinovac. That would make it the first country to offer jabs to young children. Britain ignored scientific advice and instead took a political decision when it failed to put Malta on its list of safe travel destinations, Malta foreign minister Evarist Bartolo said. Visitors to Portugal must now quarantine for 10 days on return to England, as the county’s move to the “red list” came into effect. Vietnam has started asking for public donations to buy vaccines as it struggles to contain a new coronavirus wave. Unicef has urged rich members of the G7 to start donating vaccines to poor countries now, instead of waiting to donate leftovers all at once, saying many nations don’t have capacity to roll out huge amounts in one go. India’s government will provide free vaccinations for all adults, Prime Minister Narendra Modi says, as the capital New Delhi and financial hub Mumbai ease lockdowns on falling infection levels. The state of Uttar Pradesh in India has announced that it will end some Covid restrictions. The weekday daytime curfew would be lifted in all 75 districts of the state, as all of them have fallen below 600 active Covid cases. The president of the Tokyo 2020 organizsing committee, Seiko Hashimoto, has announced that there will be restrictions on the movement media using GPS tracking during the Games. New Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Tuesday that she would get her first Covid-19 shot at the end of next week. Canada is preparing to ease birder restrictions for vaccinated travellers, Bloomberg reports. The Czech Republic has announced it will reopen its borders to EU and Serbian citizens on June 21. Spain’s football squad will be get a Covid-19 vaccine shot, less than a week before their opening Euro 2020 match, after captain Sergio Busquets tested positive. Health officials in New South Wales, Australia, have had to reiterate advice over Covid-19 after a number of businesses in Byron Shire were witnessed asking vaccinated customers not to enter their premises under the misapprehension they could shed the virus. Vietnam, once a model for its successful handling of the pandemic, has started asking for public donations to buy vaccines as it struggles to contain a new coronavirus wave. AFP reports that the south-east Asian country has vaccinated only about 1% of its population of nearly 100 million, and authorities have become increasingly alarmed by a recent spike in cases. Since last week, mobile phone users have received up to three text messages urging them to contribute to a Covid-19 vaccine fund, while civil servants have been encouraged to part with a day’s pay. Some residents, fearful of the virus’ impact on Vietnam’s economy – one of the few in the world to expand last year – told AFP they support the fundraising drive. Nguyen Tuan Anh, a civil servant, told AFP he had sent about $50 via bank transfer and SMS payment, as vaccines would mean “Vietnam’s economy will be stable and develop again”. Vietnam’s industrial northern provinces – home to key factories such as Samsung and Foxconn – have been particularly badly hit by the latest outbreak. Across the country, tens of thousands of people have lost their jobs, according to state media, with bars and restaurants forced to close in major hubs such as Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City and public gatherings cancelled. Cases have more than tripled since April to reach almost 9,000. Although the number is low in comparison to most of its south-east Asian neighbours, Vietnam’s vaccination rate per capita is the lowest in the region, and among the lowest in Asia, according to an AFP tally. The Spanish football squad’s players will be get a Covid-19 vaccine shot tomorrow, less than a week before their opening Euro 2020 match, after captain Sergio Busquets tested positive, Sports Minister Jose Manuel Rodriguez Uribes said. Busquets’ positive has thrown Spain’s tournament preparations into chaos with the remaining 23 players going into isolation along with the coaching staff. An Under-21 side led by their coach Luis de la Fuente will face Lithuania tonight in what was supposed to be the nation’s final warm-up game before the Euros. Coach Luis Enrique called up a group of six players, including Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga, to complement the squad. They will train separately in “parallel bubble” away from the main Euros squad with a view to them being added should the need occur. Reuters report that so far, all the other players and staff have tested negative. “We are making an exception because they represent us in a top level competition,” Rodriguez Uribes told Cadena Ser radio station, adding that they were already planning to give them the shots before Spain’s captain had tested positive. Health officials in New South Wales, Australia, have had to reiterate advice over Covid-19 after a number of businesses in Byron Shire were witnessed asking vaccinated customers not to enter their premises under the misapprehension they could shed the virus. The New South Wales department of health has stressed that it is impossible for people to develop, shed, or spread the virus through receiving a vaccine. The advice comes after some businesses in the small town of Mullumbimby placed signs in their windows that read: ‘If you have had the Covid-19 vaccine we ask you not to enter for two weeks or longer until any symptoms subside’. One of the signs falsely states that the spread of the virus following vaccination was emerging from “first hand accounts” and that vaccinated people were “inadvertently harming” the health of others. The town is located in the Northern Rivers region of New South Wales and is about 15km inland from Byron Bay. It is a region with a high level of vaccine hesitancy and refusal, with childhood vaccination rates among the lowest in Australia. A former paramedic who runs a World Health Organisation [WHO] approved vaccination information website, Heidi Robertson, said she was appalled to see the signs as she walked down Stuart Street on Monday. She and health professionals living in the region, including intensive care specialist Dr Rachael Heap, have been working hard for several years to educate the community about vaccination. “We wanted to change the narrative around the region, because we’ve got such a shocking rate of vaccination uptake and we are known for that in Mullumbimby,” Robertson said. Read more of Melissa Davey’s report here: ‘Vaccine won’t give you Covid’: health officials battle anti-vaccination messages in Northern Rivers Andrew Sparrow’s UK live blog is up and running for the day if it is UK developments that you are after. I’ll keep my focus on international Covid news here. A total of 95 deaths registered in England and Wales in the week ending 28 May mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) - the lowest number since the week ending 4 September 2020. PA note that the figure is down 11% on the previous week. It is the first time the number of deaths has been below 100 since the week ending 11 September. Around one in 100 deaths registered in the week to 28 May mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate. China has approved the emergency use of a Covid-19 vaccine for those as young as three, according to a spokesperson for Sinovac who spoke to AFP. That would make it the first country to offer jabs to young children. “In recent days, the Sinovac vaccine was approved for emergency use in three- to 17-year-olds,” the spokesperson said. But they did not confirm when the young children would be able to start receiving the shots, saying the schedule for the rollout will be decided by the National Health Commission “according to China’s current epidemic prevention and control needs and vaccine supply”. The company has completed early phase trials of the vaccine in children and adolescents, with results to be published shortly in the Lancet scientific journal, the spokesperson added. State broadcaster CCTV reported over the weekend that an unnamed official in the State Council’s epidemic response task force had said vaccines had been approved for children, and “the safety and effectiveness” had been proven. A spokesperson for China’s other major vaccine, Sinopharm, said that experts had demonstrated the effectiveness of its vaccine in children, but didn’t confirm whether it had been approved for use. A quick one from Reuters: Russia reported 9,977 new Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, including 3,817 in Moscow. The government coronavirus task force also said that 379 people had died of coronavirus-related causes in the last 24 hours, pushing the official death toll to 124,496. That’s far fewer than the 270,000 that the state statistics service says had died from Covid-19 and related causes from April 2020 to April 2021. Britain ignored scientific advice and instead took a political decision when it failed to put Malta on its list of safe travel destinations, Malta Foreign Minister Evarist Bartolo said. Britons traditionally account for a third of all arrivals on the small Mediterranean island, and opposition politicians criticised the government for failing to convince London that Malta was a safe tourist destination. Britain last week revised its so-called “green list” of countries, that do not require quarantine on return, choosing not to put any new country on it, while removing Portugal. But Bartolo said the British government did not want its nationals to go abroad because of concerns over growing coronavirus cases at home. “The British government is ignoring scientific advice. It has taken a political decision not to allow travel anywhere, despite the pressure it faces from airlines, tourism operators and the people in general,” he wrote on Facebook. Chris Scicluna reports from Valetta for Reuters that Malta on Monday reported no new Covid-19 cases for the first time in 11 months. Half of its adult population has been fully vaccinated and 75% have received a first dose of a vaccine - the highest rate within the European Union. Dr Nikki Kanani, director of primary care at NHS England, said that vaccine confidence in younger people had increased in the UK. Speaking as over-25s were invited to book their Covid-19 jabs, PA report Dr Kanani told BBC Breakfast: “We’re still seeing great uptake and we are definitely seeing younger people coming in and asking more questions, which is absolutely fine. “More than four in five 40 to 49-year-olds have had their first dose and two-thirds of 30 to 39-year-olds have already had theirs, and that is still going to increase, of course, as people come forward, so uptake remains high. “We had additional polling over the weekend that shows that the confidence in the vaccine has increased by a fifth - by 20% - in those under-40s. “What’s really important as we go into the younger categories is really appealing to people in their own communities and what our teams have done so well is reflect what a community needs locally - whether that’s setting up pop-up vaccination centres in Gurudwaras or temples, or in shopping malls or at workplaces, that has been critical to making sure that people feel confident to take up the vaccine when they’re asked to do so.” Overnight saw a rush to travel back to the UK from Portugal, as travellers had until 4am to return to avoid having to quarantine for 10 days after the country was moved from the “green” list to the “amber” list, without being placed on a watchlist first. The UK’s environment minister has been getting a tough ride on the media morning round in the UK – being asked whether the travel rules, and government advice, have to be this complicated, and why there was so little warning of the change of status. Eustace said “Our advice has always been that you should not travel to countries on the amber list.” The Gaby Hinsliff column today asks the question before Britain vaccinates children, should it vaccinate the world? She writes: Personally I was thrilled to get my vaccine and would be more than happy for my son to have it, but what brought me up short was the question I saw posed recently by the epidemiologist Adam Kucharski: if rich countries have enough vaccine left to jab children at incredibly low risk of serious illness and death, why aren’t they offering it to poorer countries where people are dying for lack of it? Shouldn’t we be taking more seriously the threat not just of humanitarian crises, but of a more resistant variant emerging in some place where the virus is currently raging out of control, fatally undermining the vaccines that remain our only real route to freedom? Only 2% of sub-Saharan Africa has had a first dose. Thailand, engulfed by a severe outbreak, is only just beginning mass vaccinations. Even if the G7 summit agrees this week to invest billions in ramping up vaccine production for poorer countries – as a group of former world leaders led by Gordon Brown wants – that takes months to come on stream. If Britain doesn’t want to seal its borders – and nothing in ministers’ confused approach to foreign holidays suggests they do – then digging an ever-stronger domestic firebreak against the more contagious Delta variant we have just imported from India won’t be enough. We’re going to need a global firebreak against something worse evolving too, and fast. Read more here: Gaby Hinsliff – Before Britain vaccinates children, should it vaccinate the world? Helen Davidson reports from Taipei: Some tentative good news from Taiwan, with a second consecutive day of cases in the 200s and no new cases from backlogged test results. As long as results are not down because of lower weekend testing, the decline is a positive sign in Taiwan’s battle against its worst outbreak of the pandemic. However with about 8,000 cases still active, fatalities have not stopped and authorities reported another 22 deaths. The new cases were mostly in New Taipei city, with 123 recorded. Another 54 were reported from the capital Taipei, while 16 were found in Miaoli where there are growing concerns over an outbreak among employees from three factories which has so far infected 211 people. Health and welfare minister, Chen Chih-shung, said the rate of positive cases in New Taipei was dropping but there was no room yet to relax current restrictions. He urged people not to travel during an upcoming long weekend and dragon-boat festival, which authorities have not cancelled. Vaccine supplies took another hit, with authorities saying expected shipments of AstraZeneca and from Covax had been delayed by about a month. Half of the 150,000 recently obtained Moderna vaccines have been allocated to frontline medical staff. China’s vaccination numbers are never low. Official figures reported by Reuters say that the nation administered about 16.3 million doses of vaccine on 7 June, bringing the total number administered to 794m. In India, the state of Uttar Pradesh has announced that it will end some Covid restrictions. The Hindustan Times reports this morning: The Uttar Pradesh government on Tuesday gave relaxations in ‘corona curfew’ in all 75 districts of the state. According to guidelines announced by the state government, districts with less than 600 active cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) can get relaxations. A state government spokesperson said that there will be relaxation in coronavirus curfew in all the districts of the state from Wednesday onwards, from 7am to 7pm, for five days. However, the night curfew – 7pm to 7am and weekend curfew (for entire day) – will continue. The UK’s environment secretary George Eustace – a man who clearly isn’t in the position where he hasn’t seen family and loved ones abroad for over a year due to travel bans – has told Sky News this morning: “I have no intention of travelling or going on a holiday abroad this summer.” He was being pressed by newly returned presenter Kay Burley on the scramble for flights back from Portugal after it was moved from the “green list” to the “amber list” with very little warning. PA Media quotes him saying: Our advice has been don’t travel unless it’s absolutely necessary. Obviously we had hoped, with these three categories that we had, we had hoped that situation would be improving in other parts of the world, that we’d be able to progressively add other countries to the green list. Sadly, that’s not the situation, we do have this new variant of concern first identified in India that is now cropping up in other countries, and we’ve just got to take a very cautious approach. Asked about the UK government’s delay in shutting down travel from India, he said “India was added as soon as we saw a spike in rates and as soon as we saw there was a reason to”, denying that the delay had been political. At the time Indian case numbers were rising and the government took no action, UK prime minister Boris Johnson had been planning to visit India in his first major trip abroad since the pandemic, with the aim of pushing a post-Brexit UK-India trade deal. Unicef has urged rich members of the G7 to start donating vaccines to poor countries now, instead of waiting to donate leftovers all at once, saying many nations don’t have capacity to roll out huge amounts in one go. Unicef’s vaccine lead Lily Caprani told BBC Newsnight governments in the UK and other G7 nations “need to donate their doses to those low income countries now, while still vaccinating their populations at home.” “Low income countries need a steady supply that they can get off the tarmac and into the arms of health care workers... The unintended consequence of saving all these vaccines up to Christmas time is that countries won’t be able to absorb them and roll them out and therefore they could end up going to waste. We could see millions of doses of vaccines not used and expiring, and that will be a tragedy.” The World Health Organization has also called on Covid-19 vaccine manufacturers to give the Covax scheme first refusal on new doses, or commit half of their volumes to the global jab equity scheme. Our health editor Sarah Boseley asks the question this morning: Can we vaccinate the world against Covid by the end of 2022? As ambitious declarations go – even for Boris Johnson – it was a big one. At the weekend, the UK prime minister said he would urge the G7 leaders to vaccinate the world against Covid by the end of next year. But is this feasible? That rather depends on your definition. No country will vaccinate every adult. Vaccinating enough to achieve herd immunity, which could be 60% or 70%, is the real aim. It is possible to achieve that by December 2023, say experts, but only if the G7 leading economies move immediately to make it happen. The Covax scheme under the UN umbrella should have been the route to vaccination for low-income countries. It was designed as their lifeline. Covax signed contracts with manufacturers to buy 2bn doses by the end of this year. But it is stymied. Its main supplier is the Serum Institute of India, which is now churning out vaccines in response to the terrible surge in domestic cases and deaths and will not be able to fulfil its contracts to Covax or individual countries before the end of the year. Dr Bruce Aylward, senior adviser to the director general of the World Health Organization, who is heavily involved in the vaccine efforts, said: “This is where the UK becomes really important and the G7, because right now we’ve got this gap of death. In June, July, August, September, there’s no vaccine out there for love nor money, in terms of being able to procure it.” Read more of Sarah Boseley’s analysis here: Can we vaccinate the world against Covid by the end of 2022? The president of the Tokyo 2020 organising committee, Seiko Hashimoto, is speaking this morning, and she is setting out some of the procedures that will be undertaken to try to keep the games safe. So far, she’s said that media will not be able to use shared accommodation, and that the media will be GPS-tracked to ensure they don’t go into unauthorised areas. She has also said that they expect to start vaccinating Olympics-related staff by mid-June. Reuters note that foreign spectators have already been banned, and organisers are expected to make a decision late this month on domestic spectators. Toshiaki Endo, the vice-president of the Tokyo organising committee, has previously suggested to Reuters some spectators could be allowed into venues, although he personally preferred a total ban to calm persistent public opposition to the Games. On the downside, I just saw this tweet today, and now I can’t stop thinking about it either… Good morning, it is Martin Belam here in London taking over today’s blog. The biggest news in England is the extension of vaccinations to those aged 25 and over this morning. If you fall into that category you can book your shot at the NHS England site here. Northern Ireland has already been offering vaccines to anybody over 18, you can find out more here. Those in Scotland and Wales can find out the latest information for them here: NHS Scotland Gov.wales Reuters: New Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Tuesday that she would get her first Covid-19 shot at the end of next week, as the country prepared to receive another 1 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine. “For me, it’s been important that I allow those in the most at risk group... to be prioritised,” Ardern said in a news conference. “I’m choosing to be vaccinated at this point in order to play my role in demonstrating that I consider it to be absolutely safe and also really critical to keep others safe,” she said. China today pledged further assistance to Southeast Asian nations in battling the pandemic, the Associated Press reports. The country’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, told his Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) counterparts that China had already delivered 100 million doses of vaccine to Asean nations along with other materials and technical help. Wang said China would “urgently implement” the China-Asean Public Health Cooperation Initiative, continue to support the Asean Emergency Medical Materials Reserve and strengthen regional public health capacity-building. “China will work with Asean to overcome the outbreak as soon as possible,” Wang told a meeting of ministers. He said the sides should explore establishing an expert panel to strengthen cooperation throughout the vaccine process, from research to use, and work to build production and distribution centres to help make vaccines affordable and accessible in the region. Though Covid-19 was first detected in China in late 2019, the nation has largely stamped out domestic transmission, although it has been accused of insufficient transparency or even seeking to conceal the origins of the pandemic. Beijing has been building influence with Asean, despite frictions with some members of the bloc over competing territorial claims in the South China Sea. Welcome to another day of the pandemic, and our continuing global coverage of the latest developments. Below are some of the key updates from the last day.

It criticised what it claims is a worrying trend driven by the widespread shortage of nurses in England, where there are almost 35,000 unfilled NHS nursing posts. The RCN said the employment of non-nurses to work as nurses in hospitals and mental health facilities “should set alarm bells ringing with ministers” and would lead to worse care. It published examples of advertisements posted by NHS trusts looking to fill nursing roles, including some senior positions, even if the candidate was not qualified as a nurse. One trust advertised for a matron – a managerial role usually filled by a senior nurse – to work in acute medicine but said that a qualification in nursing was not necessary. Another trust recently sought to recruit a matron who would be responsible for older people’s mental health and learning disability services. It said that the post was open to a “registered professional clinician with demonstrable evidence of working at senior level”. However, it did not specify that the successful applicant had to be registered with the Nursing and Midwifery Council, which regulates both professions, clearing the way for non-nurses to apply. Pat Cullen, the RCN’s acting general secretary, warned that the “growing practice” of non-nurses filling registered nursing roles “leaves patients without professional nursing care and compromises safety”. Inquiries and reviews into inadequate care, including the Mid Staffordshire scandal in the 2000s, have shown that a lack of properly qualified nurses can damage patient care, she added. A third advert, for a staff nurse on the NHS band five pay scale, said that the post-holder should be “RGN/RN or equivalent allied health professional”, which meant that applications from physiotherapists and occupational therapists would be considered. Gloucestershire Health and Care NHS trust invited applications for a nursing role in a psychiatric intensive care unit dealing with people with serious mental health problems. However, it stressed that the recruit could be a staff nurse, nursing associate – a new role being expanded to help plug the shortfall of registered nurses – or healthcare assistant.

The charities are all funded by the Home Office to provide support to vulnerable EU citizens including children and elderly people in care, victims of domestic abuse and trafficking, Roma communities and homeless people. Matthew Evans, director of Advice on Individual Rights in Europe (Aire), said it was “unacceptable” that EU citizens who had built their lives in the UK could be left undocumented by “an arbitrary deadline”. The letter to the prime minister acknowledges new laws introduced last October to allow late applications if there were “reasonable grounds” – for instance, a child in care who turned 18 and discovered the local authority had not made the application to the Home Office for settled or pre-settled status. But they told Johnson they were sceptical about the Home Office approach. “Historically the Home Office has taken a very stringent approach toward reasonable grounds and outlines in this guidance [on late applications] that the approach towards late applications will become stricter with time, which raises serious concerns about how this ‘benefit of the doubt’ will actually be applied to vulnerable people,” they said in the letter. Charities fear that those who lose their right to remain in the UK even temporarily mean they are at risk of detention and deportation creating “huge and potentially life-ruining risks”. The signatories to the letter include Coram children’s legal centre, Citizens Advice bureaux from all over the UK from Cornwall to Liverpool, Father Hudson’s Care, a network of Catholic communities centres, the East European Resource Centre, the Simon Community Scotland, Rights of Women and the Peterborough Asylum &amp; Refugee Community Association. Concerns have been repeatedly raised about the legal status of those who have not applied by 30 June even though they have the right to remain if they lived in the UK before 31 December last year. Although 5.4m applications have been received by the Home Office – about 2mhigher than estimates, data has never been captured the number of EU citizens or nationals from the European Economic Area in the country because there has never been a registration system, unlike many other EU countries. The charities are urging Johnson to lift the deadline completely and not impose another until they can demonstrate that all eligible EU citizens and non-EU family members have secured status. “If even 1% of the millions of EU citizens resident in the UK are unable to apply, that would leave tens of thousands of EEA+ citizens undocumented, vulnerable to exploitation and facing hostile environment policies including detention and removal,” they said. “We know this is not something anybody wants. Yet it is the people our organisations support … who are most likely to slip through the cracks,” they told the prime minister. Marianne Lagrue, policy manager at Coram, said it was “positive” that the Home Office had funded the charities but “that funding could never reach everyone” with just weeks to go. “If anything, it has demonstrated to us as grant-funded organisations the high level of need that still exists with barely weeks to go,” she said. Jackie Murphy, CEO of TGP Cymru, which provides support to Roma communities, urged Johnson to take account of the “huge disruption” to “face to face” support programmes caused by Covid-19 in addition to a backlog of appointments at embassies for those who need to renew ID cards for their applications. The Home Office has been approached for comment.","charCount":"3706","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/lisaocarroll\">Lisa O'Carroll</a> Brexit correspondent"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2021/jun/09/half-british-adults-watched-porn-pandemic-ofcom","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-08T23:01:33Z","webTitle":"Half of adults in UK watched porn during pandemic, says Ofcom","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/jun/09/half-british-adults-watched-porn-pandemic-ofcom","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2021/jun/09/half-british-adults-watched-porn-pandemic-ofcom","fields":{"headline":"Half of adults in UK watched porn during pandemic, says Ofcom","standfirst":"<p>Research shows PornHub has bigger audience than BBC News – and people increasingly live lives online</p>","trailText":"Research shows PornHub has bigger audience than BBC News – and people increasingly live lives online","byline":"Jim Waterson Media editor","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ab995a89731fd9d55ecda3f0c39bff84474ec93a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab995a89731fd9d55ecda3f0c39bff84474ec93a/0_0_3095_1858/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pornhub screen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">By far the most popular pornography site was PornHub, which was visited by 50% of all British men and 16% of all British women in the UK in September 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Canadian Press/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Half the adult population of the UK watched online pornography during the pandemic, according to a projection by Ofcom which lays bare the activities of the 26 million individuals who view adult material.</p> <p>By far the most popular pornography site was PornHub, which was visited by 50% of all males and 16% of all females in the UK in September 2020 – giving the site a far larger audience than mainstream television channels such as Sky One, ITV4 and BBC News.</p> <p>The figures rise substantially among younger age groups, with a third of young women and three-quarters of young men visiting PornHub in the four weeks covered by the research.

This research is critical to keep pace with these changes in technology, economics and behaviour, as we prepare to take on new responsibilities for regulating online safety.”","charCount":"3367","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/jim-waterson\">Jim Waterson</a> Media editor"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/cryptic/28467","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-08T23:00:33Z","webTitle":"Cryptic crossword No 28,467","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/28467","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/cryptic/28467","fields":{"headline":"Cryptic crossword No 28,467","trailText":"Cryptic crossword No 28,467","byline":"Puck","main":"","body":"","wordcount":"0","commentCloseDate":"2021-06-11T23:00:33Z","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2021-06-08T23:00:33Z","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2021-06-08T23:02:35Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2021-06-09T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/p/hkc2g","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","isLive":"true","bodyText":"","charCount":"0","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/puck\">Puck</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"film/2021/jun/08/awake-review-gina-rodriguez-netflix-bird-box-lite-thriller","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-08T23:00:33Z","webTitle":"Awake review – Netflix’s Bird Box-lite thriller is a real snooze","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/jun/08/awake-review-gina-rodriguez-netflix-bird-box-lite-thriller","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2021/jun/08/awake-review-gina-rodriguez-netflix-bird-box-lite-thriller","fields":{"headline":"Awake review – Netflix’s Bird Box-lite thriller is a real snooze","standfirst":"<p>Gina Rodriguez can’t save a silly and unintentionally amusing apocalyptic tale about a mysterious affliction that means people are no longer able to sleep</p>","trailText":"Gina Rodriguez can’t save a silly and unintentionally amusing apocalyptic tale about a mysterious affliction that means people are no longer able to sleep","byline":"Benjamin Lee","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c60081bde55c61de1fd63657ac6b8b2bebc9be5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c60081bde55c61de1fd63657ac6b8b2bebc9be5d/0_57_7200_4320/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lucius Hoyos, Gina Rodriguez and Ariana Greenblatt\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lucius Hoyos, Gina Rodriguez and Ariana Greenblatt</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter H Stranks/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>There’s something so distractingly and, errr, sleepily half-assed about the inert new Netflix thriller Awake that watching it is almost as much of a bore as having to then write about it.

Stefano Marzaroli points out that “Milan were relegated in 1982 and seven seasons later in 1988-89 they won the European Cup”. And in Franco Baresi and Mauro Tassotti, half the fabled Milan back four, went there from the drop to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/may/24/great-european-cup-teams-milan\">winning the European Cup</a> against Steaua Bucharest at Camp Nou.</p> <p>Rob P keeps it on the home front. “You don’t have to step out of England to better this. Nottingham Forest are the true European wild cards – relegated 1972, European Cup winners 1979, they won a second European Cup and are unique in winning the trophy more often than winning their national championship.

They were relegated in 1967 then dropped to the third tier in 1970, so were two promotions from the top flight. They came back up in 1972 and to the top flight in 1975. By 1982 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/that-1980s-sports-blog/2016/may/26/aston-villa-european-cup-relegated-1982\">they were European champions</a>, seven years after being a Second Division side and only 10 after being a Third Division side. Spurs won the Uefa Cup in 1984 after being relegated in 1977. Manchester City won the Cup Winners’ Cup in 1970, having been relegated in 1966. Seven years seems the norm for English clubs,” a fact rammed home by Peter Collins, who adds that “West Ham were promoted in 1958 and won the Cup Winners’ Cup in 1965”.</p> <p>But for some European specialist info on speedy recoveries from relegation, we turn to Dick Maas and a pair of six-year turnarounds. “KV Mechelen were relegated from Belgium’s Eerste Klasse in 1982 and won the Cup Winners’ Cup in 1988, while Sevilla were relegated from La Liga in 2000 and won the Uefa Cup in 2006.”</p> <h2><strong>The shortest gap between successive red cards</strong></h2> <p><strong>“Yuri Alberto of Internacional was recently sent off in the closing stages of a Copa Libertadores match.

Here’s Kirk Burton: “After coming on as a sub on his debut for Aberdeen, Pepper was sent off after six minutes. In Pepper’s first game after suspension he was sent off again after 17 seconds.

Matt Robb writes: “We had last-day survivals in 1973-74, 1981-82, 1986-87, 1992-93, 2013-14, 2016-17, 2017-18, 2019-20 (eight times). We’ve also got relegated on the last day in 1984, 1994, 2008, 2011 (four times). We’ve gone up on the last day in 1972, 1980, 1995, 2009 (four times). Missed out on the play-offs in 1990 and 1998. In 1979, 1986, 1989, 2006 we were already relegated and in 1985, 1992, 2007. And in 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2012 we were in the play-offs. So that is 22 times in the last 43 seasons we’ve gone to the last day not knowing which division we’d be in next season and a further six we’d already committed to changing.”</p> <p>But if you want dramatic survival specialists, look to Coventry City. “We escaped/avoided relegation on the final day in … <em>breathes</em> … 1922, 1968, 1969, 1977, 1981, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1992, 1996, 1997, 2008, and 2015, in addition to ‘escaping’ deselection from the league in 1920 and 1928. So that’s a lucky 13 (or 15) times. Ten of those times were in the top flight, including a precarious three-season stretch in the mid-80s.”</p> <h2><strong>Knowledge archive</strong></h2> <p><strong>Is it true that Falkirk (or another Scottish side) were once shipwrecked on the way to a game?” </strong>wondered Dan Palmer, in September 2012.</p> <p>It is indeed, Dan, but the side who took a dip in the briny deep came from further down the Firth of Forth. Kirkcaldy’s Raith Rovers can justifiably claim to be pioneers of the Scottish game – they had enjoyed a successful trip to Copenhagen in the summer of 1922 and fancied repeating the trick at the end of the following season, but this time taking in the sunnier climbs of the Canary Islands. So in the summer of 1923 they boarded the Highland Loch, which was calling in at the Canaries en route to Buenos Aires with its cargo of passengers and, apparently, chilled meat.</p> <p>The Stark’s Park party had reached northern Spain and were off the coast of Galicia, negotiating Cape Finisterre, in violent weather when the ship ran aground. The players and other passengers were roused from their beds, lifeboats were manned and the group was towed to the village of Villagarcia by local fishermen.</p> <p>The following day a passing liner bound for the Canaries picked up the 20-strong Rovers squad and were, according to Rovers player Tom Jennings, invited to eat at the captain’s table because of their chivalrous behaviour during the rain-swept abandoning of the Highland Loch. A few days later they were safely deposited at their destination – and the traumatic journey did not seem to adversely effect the players. They won all four games on the tour, although history does not report another European adventure in 1924 …</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/series/index.html?vertical=Sport&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=The%20Knowledge&amp;description=Discover%20hundreds%20more%20questions%20and%20answers%20in%20our%20archives&amp;read-more-link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ffootball%2Fseries%2Ftheknowledge&amp;links=false\" data-alt=\"Knowledge archive\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/series/index.html?vertical=Sport&opinion-tint=false&title=The%20Knowledge&description=Discover%20hundreds%20more%20questions%20and%20answers%20in%20our%20archives&read-more-link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ffootball%2Fseries%2Ftheknowledge&links=false\">Knowledge archive</a> </figure>  <h2><strong>Can you help?</strong></h2> <p>“St Etienne have an English-born keeper called Etienne Green on their books – his name containing both the team name and nickname (<em>Les Verts</em>) of his club.

Is that the quickest time from relegation to winning a major European trophy?” asks Paul Savage. There were plenty of replies to this one, and the Yellow Submarines were by no means the quickest to rise from the depths. Stefano Marzaroli points out that “Milan were relegated in 1982 and seven seasons later in 1988-89 they won the European Cup”. And in Franco Baresi and Mauro Tassotti, half the fabled Milan back four, went there from the drop to winning the European Cup against Steaua Bucharest at Camp Nou. Rob P keeps it on the home front. “You don’t have to step out of England to better this. Nottingham Forest are the true European wild cards – relegated 1972, European Cup winners 1979, they won a second European Cup and are unique in winning the trophy more often than winning their national championship. They’re also the only winner to have subsequently dropped to the third tier after winning it.” Brian Clough took over in January 1975, only winning promotion from the Second Division at the end of the 1976-77 season. “Aston Villa earn a mention as well. They were relegated in 1967 then dropped to the third tier in 1970, so were two promotions from the top flight. They came back up in 1972 and to the top flight in 1975. By 1982 they were European champions, seven years after being a Second Division side and only 10 after being a Third Division side. Spurs won the Uefa Cup in 1984 after being relegated in 1977. Manchester City won the Cup Winners’ Cup in 1970, having been relegated in 1966. Seven years seems the norm for English clubs,” a fact rammed home by Peter Collins, who adds that “West Ham were promoted in 1958 and won the Cup Winners’ Cup in 1965”. But for some European specialist info on speedy recoveries from relegation, we turn to Dick Maas and a pair of six-year turnarounds. “KV Mechelen were relegated from Belgium’s Eerste Klasse in 1982 and won the Cup Winners’ Cup in 1988, while Sevilla were relegated from La Liga in 2000 and won the Uefa Cup in 2006.” The shortest gap between successive red cards “Yuri Alberto of Internacional was recently sent off in the closing stages of a Copa Libertadores match. Less than two days later, in a domestic match with bitter rivals Grêmio, he was again red-carded after 38 minutes. Has there ever been a shorter gap between one player’s dismissals?” asks Eugene Francis. We’ve covered this before in a segment about dreadful debuts, but it is worth recalling Nigel Pepper’s impressive feat for Aberdeen back in 1998 shortly after his £300,000 move from Bradford City. Here’s Kirk Burton: “After coming on as a sub on his debut for Aberdeen, Pepper was sent off after six minutes. In Pepper’s first game after suspension he was sent off again after 17 seconds. Aberdeen band Depeche Choad have a song named in tribute to his second brief appearance, the song is just as brief.” The Elche question “This season, for the fifth time in their history, Elche avoided relegation on the last day (1969-70, 1973-74, 1975-76, 2013-14 and 2020-21). Can any other team beat this,” wonders Andrea Parapini. Tim Ward takes us to Wearside. “Sunderland have avoided top-flight relegation on the last day on the following seasons: 1927-28, 1980-81, 1982-83, 1983-84, 2001-02 and 2008-09. They also avoided relegation to the third tier on the last day of the 1985-86 and 1992-93 seasons.” Birmingham City can beat that without going any further back than the 1970s, mind. Matt Robb writes: “We had last-day survivals in 1973-74, 1981-82, 1986-87, 1992-93, 2013-14, 2016-17, 2017-18, 2019-20 (eight times). We’ve also got relegated on the last day in 1984, 1994, 2008, 2011 (four times). We’ve gone up on the last day in 1972, 1980, 1995, 2009 (four times). Missed out on the play-offs in 1990 and 1998. In 1979, 1986, 1989, 2006 we were already relegated and in 1985, 1992, 2007. And in 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2012 we were in the play-offs. So that is 22 times in the last 43 seasons we’ve gone to the last day not knowing which division we’d be in next season and a further six we’d already committed to changing.” But if you want dramatic survival specialists, look to Coventry City. “We escaped/avoided relegation on the final day in … breathes … 1922, 1968, 1969, 1977, 1981, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1992, 1996, 1997, 2008, and 2015, in addition to ‘escaping’ deselection from the league in 1920 and 1928. So that’s a lucky 13 (or 15) times. Ten of those times were in the top flight, including a precarious three-season stretch in the mid-80s.” Knowledge archive Is it true that Falkirk (or another Scottish side) were once shipwrecked on the way to a game?” wondered Dan Palmer, in September 2012. It is indeed, Dan, but the side who took a dip in the briny deep came from further down the Firth of Forth. Kirkcaldy’s Raith Rovers can justifiably claim to be pioneers of the Scottish game – they had enjoyed a successful trip to Copenhagen in the summer of 1922 and fancied repeating the trick at the end of the following season, but this time taking in the sunnier climbs of the Canary Islands. So in the summer of 1923 they boarded the Highland Loch, which was calling in at the Canaries en route to Buenos Aires with its cargo of passengers and, apparently, chilled meat. The Stark’s Park party had reached northern Spain and were off the coast of Galicia, negotiating Cape Finisterre, in violent weather when the ship ran aground. The players and other passengers were roused from their beds, lifeboats were manned and the group was towed to the village of Villagarcia by local fishermen. The following day a passing liner bound for the Canaries picked up the 20-strong Rovers squad and were, according to Rovers player Tom Jennings, invited to eat at the captain’s table because of their chivalrous behaviour during the rain-swept abandoning of the Highland Loch. A few days later they were safely deposited at their destination – and the traumatic journey did not seem to adversely effect the players. They won all four games on the tour, although history does not report another European adventure in 1924 … Can you help? “St Etienne have an English-born keeper called Etienne Green on their books – his name containing both the team name and nickname (Les Verts) of his club. Are there any other strange player name quirks such as this?” asks Adam Facer. “I think it is quite well known that England are slow starters in major tournaments but for a (supposedly) top-ranked side, their record in the opening game is pretty dismal. Of 24 performances at European Championships and World Cups, they’ve won six, drawn 11, and lost seven. Of countries that have qualified for more than 20 tournaments, who has a worse win percentage than England’s 25%?” wonders Jeremy Orbell. “Scoring as a goalkeeper is rare, but in the second leg of Bournemouth’s play-off semi against Brentford, Asmir Begovic achieved something arguably more unusual for a keeper – being called offside. Has this happened before in English football?” muses Kieran Murray.

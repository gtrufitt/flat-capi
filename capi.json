The South Australian government has promised to spend $111 million over the next 10 years to upgrade railway stations across metropolitan Adelaide, reports AAP. The funding includes $66.4 million across the next four years to be allocated in this month’s state budget. It will allow for station makeovers to ensure they are safer and more enjoyable for train commuters. Premier Steven Marshall said the funding would encourage more people to leave their cars at home and catch public transport “We know that if we can get more people onto our buses and trains it will help to ease traffic congestion on our roads and reduce the impacts on the environment,” Marshall said. The station upgrades will include new shelters, seating and bins, lighting upgrades, painting, and landscaping, and are expected to create more than 100 jobs. Scott Morrison is giving a speech in Perth but so far it’s been pleasantries and musings on tonight’s State of Origin. Something about blue tie, something about a WA audience not getting the reference. If there are questions, I’ll bring you Morrison’s comments live. But his speech has already been briefed out, and you can read about it below. Three unregistered dogs have been put down after they attacked and killed a Queensland mother who was minding them, reports AAP. Tributes are flowing for 41-year-old Amanda Carmichael, who was mauled to death in the yard of a Maryborough home on Tuesday morning. Paramedics fought to revive her but she was pronounced dead at the Milton Road property where the attack occurred. She had suffered wounds to her head, chest and arm. The mixed-breed dogs had already been corralled into a shed by the time authorities arrived. They were seized by council officers and were later put down after the owner formally surrendered them. Fraser Coast mayor George Seymour has offered his condolences to Carmichael’s family and friends. “This is a tragic event that is now subject to a police investigation and until the coronial inquest has been undertaken, we cannot comment on the circumstances surrounding the incident,” he said in a statement. “The dogs were unregistered.” Police have said Carmichael was well known and well liked in the Maryborough community, and her death is being treated as a tragic accident. A report will be prepared for the coroner. Not everyone is happy with Josh Frydenberg’s op-ed in the Herald Sun today. Just to let you know we’re expecting the prime minister, Scott Morrison, to step up for a media conference in about half an hour. The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RANZCOG) and the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (Atagi) has updated its Covid vaccine advice for pregnant women. They recommend pregnant women at any stage of pregnancy be routinely offered the Pfizer mRNA vaccine. “This is because the risk of severe outcomes from Covid-19 is significantly higher for pregnant women and their unborn baby,” a joint RANZCOG/ Atagi statement said. Global surveillance data from large numbers of pregnant women have not identified any significant safety concerns with mRNA Covid-19 vaccines given at any stage of pregnancy. Furthermore, there is also evidence of antibody in cord blood and breastmilk, which may offer protection to infants through passive immunity. Pregnant women are encouraged to discuss the decision in relation to timing of vaccination with their health professional. Women who are trying to become pregnant do not need to delay vaccination or avoid becoming pregnant after vaccination, the advice states. Epic Games is appealing the federal court decision preventing its case against Apple over the banning of Fortnite from the store from being waged in Australia while a similar court case in the United States is under way. Fortnite was banned from the Apple App Store last year after Epic offered an alternative payment method in the app that allowed people to bypass Apple’s own in-app payments system on which Apple takes up to a 30% slice. The federal court ruled earlier this year that it would be up to the US court to refer any issued under Australian competition law back to Australia. The full federal court heard from Epic’s lawyers that a US court is an “inappropriate and incapable forum” to determine Australian law, and could not grant remedies to the same degree as an Australian court would. The court also heard the stay would allow companies to put forum selection clauses into their contracts which would prevent legal action being brought in Australia for contraventions of Australian competition law. The case continues this afternoon, with Apple to respond. Google and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission also made written submissions to the court, but were not required to give verbal submissions. The Reserve Bank of Australia expects there will be a last-minute rush from banks to take advantage of a funding program that is due to end this month, reports AAP. Its three-year term funding facility provides low-cost funding for banks. It was introduced by the central bank during the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic and at a time of extreme economic uncertainty. RBA assistant governor for financial markets Christopher Kent said to date around $145bn has been drawn down from the facility. “Banks have until the end of this month to draw on remaining allowances of $64bn,” he told an online conference on Wednesday. He noted drawdowns have accelerated in recent weeks – a similar experience to when the TFF was initially set to run until September 2020. “We expect that the bulk of available funding will be taken up because the cost of the facility remains well below the cost of similar funding available in the market,” Kent said in his speech to the KangaNews Debt Capital Markets Summit. On what proportion needs to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity, Khorshid says that’s not the primary aim. We don’t know enough about the vaccines and enough about the various types, variants of this virus, to know what proportion of the population needs to be vaccinated with which vaccine to get to true herd immunity. That’s not really the aim here. The aim is to keep Australians out of the hospital. That’s been enunciated by the chief health officer and governments around the country and that should still be our primary aim. Khorshid is talking about the AMA’s support for a sugar tax. He says: It’s really a signal to the society from government to say, “This product is actually not helpful. This product has no nutritional value, this product is harming your health and the health of others in the community. So let’s drive a change in society.” The AMA also supports an “increased volumetric taxes on alcohol or a floor price”, he says. Khorshid is asked about the Victorian government’s response to the pandemic, and in particular the current lockdown. He says: The AMA has been supportive of the actions of the Victorian government. I think the public expects to be kept safe and this is what is necessary to be kept safe when we’re in an evolving situation. As information comes in, things become clearer, decisions become easier to make. I think the best thing for us all to do is support the advice that’s been given by the chief health officers around the country. His main message is that people should go out and get vaccinated. My colleague Paul Karp asked Omar Khorshid about the AMA’s concerns about the recent proposed changes to Medicare rebates. He asked if the AMA’s concerns have been addressed and what he made of Labor’s warnings of a government assault on Medicare. Are we likely to see another “Mediscare campaign”? Khorshid says: I certainly hope we’re not going see a Mediscare campaign. The sad reality of Medicare is successive governments over the entire life of Medicare have failed to index it properly, and have therefore effectively cut Medicare for 30 years. This review that the AMA has supported was designed to modernise the MBS, and it has taken five years to do, we have a few quibbles and issues with how it was done, but at the end of the day the AMA is supportive of the review process and of most of the outcomes. Khorshid says what the AMA was not happy with was the “process of implementation”. “That message has been heard by government, and the agreement with the minister was that for future rounds there will be more time given so every patient is ensured a full, informed financial consent,” he says. A former schoolmate of Adelaide woman Ann Marie Smith, who died in horrific circumstances while under disability care, has relayed a moving account of their longtime friendship, reports AAP. In a statement read to the disability royal commission on Wednesday, the woman said Smith enjoyed singing along to Abba songs, loved her dogs and had an unforgettable laugh. The pair had gone to primary school together in Adelaide and had kept in touch during high school and as adults. “We watched each other grow from little girls to adult women and I will always cherish our friendship through many good years,” the woman said. But she said Smith could also be headstrong and stubborn, and told the commission they did not speak with each other in the year before her death because of a falling out. “This is something I really struggle with. I shouldn’t have made excuses,” the woman said. “I carry a lot of guilt about that and I know that things would have been different if I had gone around to see her. “For me, it is still incomprehensible what has happened to her.” Smith, who had cerebral palsy, died in hospital in April last year from septic shock, multiple organ failure, severe pressure sores and malnourishment. She had been found to be living in squalid conditions in her own home, largely confined to a cane chair, while under the care of the national disability insurance scheme. Her death has been subject to a police investigation, with her former carer Rosa Maria Maione charged with manslaughter. NDIS quality and safeguards commissioner Graeme Head also launched an independent investigation by former federal court judge Alan Robertson, with his report last year essentially clearing the commission in how it exercised its regulatory functions. Robertson said on the question of whether it should have acted earlier to ban Maione, the commission had no information to take such action before Smith’s death. He said there had been no complaints made to the commission and no incidents reported in relation to the 54-year-old’s care. And in terms of action against her care provider, Integrity Care, Robertson found that once the commission became aware of Smith’s death, it took steps in relation to the company. “I have not identified any significant failings in the nature or timing of those steps,” he said. Just back on the Liveability Index, here’s the Guardian’s news story on this year’s list. Meanwhile, Omar Khorshid, the president of the Australian Medical Association, is speaking at the National Press Club in Canberra. I’ll be sure to bring you any notable moments from that event. And that just about wraps up the Victorian press conference. Thanks Matilda. It’s Luke Henriques-Gomes here. We’ve moved on a bit from Covid now. James Merlino is asked about the Economist’s liveability index. Melbourne has slumped to eighth place. A reporter asks: does Melbourne still deserve to be in the top 10? Merlino says: Do we deserve that? Do we deserve being in the top 10?Absolutely we do! This is the best place in the world to live. Victoria in Melbourne, we are going through a tough time at the moment, but it is still the best place to live. I love being a Melburnian, and we look forward to climbing back up that ladder over the next few years. With that, I shall pass you over to the fantastic Luke Henriques-Gomes to see off the press conference and take you through the rest of the afternoon. Let’s have a chat about brothels! Under the new restrictions, regional brothels are allowed 100 customers a day. One reporter has asked why this is the case when you can only have two visitors in your home, and chief health officer Brett Sutton says the answer is scale: Visitors to the home are a cumulative risk. We are talking about hundreds of thousands, millions of homes across Victoria. When you have a particular easing of a restriction for an indoor environment, the most high-risk environment indeed for coronavirus, you have to look at the cumulative effect at what it means to allow two people, plus dependants, excluding kids under 12 months, across hundreds of thousands of homes. For other venues, you are also looking at the cumulative risk, and if there are only three or four of those venues, if there are no casinos, if there are a few other settings you are talking about using restrictions, the cumulative risk is not the same as what it means to change the settings for a private gathering. Of course, if you are looking at my home versus what I am able to do in another setting, it looks out of accord, but we have to look at what it means to make these changes across the board, understanding what it means for millions and millions of person-to-person interactions. Sutton has been asked why the lockdown measures have to ease tomorrow night not right this second. There are complex legal drafting matters to be done that needs to be measured against all of the charted considerations for each and every charter obligation that is in play with restrictions. And to make sure that it is not a sloppy process. We need to go through with a fine-tooth comb to make sure every single drafted peas with the public health directions are appropriate and correct. You are talking about public health advice. So good news, Melbourne is coming out of lockdown. Bad news, this means the federal government’s already fairly narrow wages support package will be cut off. Merlino says the federal government has rejected requests for this funding to be extended: These are the settings that the federal government put in place. They put a lot of conditions on the funding. We welcome the additional support but acknowledge that whether it is the conditions that they set, the taxing arrangements that they put to that funding, that is a decision that they have made. We understand hardship doesn’t end at 11.59pm tomorrow night. I can confirm that Tim Pallas, our treasurer, reached out to the federal treasurer to advocate for the continuation of support. My understanding is that is not forthcoming but in terms of questions of additional income support and continuation of that support, that should be put to the federal government. Now it’s time to talk about Victoria’s hospital capacity, which has been feeling the strain in recent months. Reporter: How would our hospitals cope with a Covid surge if one were to happen? We don’t have enough nurses and there aren’t enough beds as is. Are you concerned if we were to have another outbreak, our hospital won’t be able to cope? Health minister Martin Foley: I am concerned about every case of Covid. In terms of preparation by our healthcare system, as we have seen, for instance, in the private residential aged care system with the Arcare Maidstone number of cases, I think it is three residents out there, whether it is aged care to be immediately moved into hospitals where it has been run which has happened with those three cases there. Whether it is prioritising all the work in a number of particular hospitals that would be best placed should there be cases that need hospitalisation, we have done a lot of preparatory work with those hospitals in the healthcare system and in a collaborative way to be ready should that happen. That is why these public health measures that we have been taking in the past few weeks are designed to avoid that set of circumstances. Sutton says while hotel quarantine is not perfect, it’s still a very important part of Australia’s Covid-19 response, which didn’t actually answer the question he was asked. Have a look. Reporter: The statistics ... relate to the number of positive cases. Per positive case with one in every 42 positive cases is a breach. That is the highest rate of any state per cases. Do you have any idea why that is? These are recent figures. Sutton: Sure. Hotel quarantine is not a perfect system. As Paul Kelly’s referred to this in estimates, it is still probably the most powerful and positive public health intervention that Australia could have made back in March last year. It has gotten us to that state of no community transmission that has made a world of difference on the global scale, in terms of how we have managed to open up in Australia and how we have managed to protect so many Australians from dying from Covid. There will be ongoing challenges with hotel quarantine. We just need to continue to investigate and improve as much as possible and where alternatives that can be built exist, we should pursue those also. Side note: I haven’t seen that “1 in 42 positive cases” myself so I can’t vouch for that in terms of accuracy. I’ll see if I can find out where that came from. More questions for Sutton (he has been up for quite a while now, come on Merlino, help a bro out!) Reporter: Between the end of October and June, Victoria has had the highest rate of hotel quarantine breaches per case of any other state, with one in every 42 cases of breach. Why is this? Sutton: We have had fewer breaches than some other jurisdictions with respect to hotel quarantine. We need to look at what the causes are but, as the acting premier said, as every first minister or head of quarantine or public health across the country has said, we need to look at every single aspect, every mitigation in hotel quarantine because they are not from an engineering point of view, the most ideal – they’re not open air. Another reporter: Do you have ongoing confidence in hotel quarantine in Victoria? Sutton: Yes, absolutely. Again, it doesn’t mean we should never consider that there isn’t a risk of the virus coming out of hotel quarantine. You can check out a full table of the new restrictions here. If you prefer a version without an eye-wateringly busy layout, I’ll link to the Guardian Australia explainer as soon as it’s updated. The federal treasurer (and Victorian resident) Josh Frydenberg released an op-ed today calling for school closures to be used as an absolute last resort in the case of a Covid outbreak. Merlino was just asked about this: Moving to remote learning is a last resort, absolutely is a last resort and for last couple of weeks, our schools have been open for vulnerable children and for children of authorised workers. We are in a position, based on public health advice, to have our year 11s and 12s back at school last Friday. I am pleased, as education minister and a parent, that on Friday, all children will be back at school. The Victorian Liberal opposition is gunning hard for more transparency around health decisions. Merlino was just been asked what he thinks of this tactic. Reporter: The Victorian opposition is calling for the health advice behind lockdowns to be made public. Do you support that? Merlino: I am very happy to deal with this myth that the Liberals are pedalling around transparency. We have got the public health directions which are publicly available. That is the public health advice, signed off by Victoria’s chief health officer. We have got experts standing up every day answering all sorts of questions, Prof Sutton, Prof Cheng, Covid-19 commander, commissioner Casser from CQV and in the parliament, in terms of the state of emergency legislation, there is a written report provided by the chief health officer monthly and a briefing to the parliament on the pandemic. Being absolutely transparent and clear with people, in terms of the situation, the settings that are in place and the reasons why, this is a complete myth pedalled by the Liberals. Merlino is making no promises on further lockdowns: In terms of any further lockdowns, whether we are talking about Victoria, New South Wales, WA or SA this is a global pandemic and it is impacting our nation. The path to easing of restrictions completely and living a normal life is the successful rollout of the Commonwealth’s vaccination program and the construction and the operation of a purpose-built quarantine facility for our highest risk people. That has always been the path through this pandemic. In meantime, we make our hotel quarantine system as safe as we possibly can, and if and when there is an outbreak, we absolutely run it to ground so we can get back to the life that we’re enjoying just a few weeks ago. Sutton has been asked when people in Victoria can expect to “snap back” to pre-outbreak conditions: It is a week-by-week respect, as the acting premier has flagged, we are looking aspirationally to the kind of levels that regional Victoria are moving to now in a further week. That would be my further hope. We can be surprised on a day-by-day basis around what can emerge, and we have to recognise it remains a reasonably volatile situation. The idea of a snap back to absolutely no restrictions whatsoever, no one has done that after significant community transmission, it didn’t happen after Avalon, it hasn’t happened after other significant community outbreaks, and so we have to move by increments, safely, but with the minimum restrictions that we know will continue to control this. Reporter: Where do you believe there are people not in quarantine who should be who would spread it if we open it up fully today? Sutton: Well, if I knew where they were, we wouldn’t be worried about them. It is potentially undetected cases out there and we have had a few mystery cases over the last couple of weeks, you know, as recently as a week or so ago. So it is needing to have that high level of testing in coming days to be absolutely sure that there are no undetected chains of transmission. The Delta variant is one in particular that is obviously being discovered through people coming forward for testing which doesn’t have that intermediary case, necessarily, with hotel quarantine. I would want to be absolutely sure that we can find if there are any cases. But also, with the other variants, the Kappa variant, we have had a number of cases where acquisition is it absolutely clear, so we just need to run back down as much as possible. Remember back in the day when everyone was pretending that we weren’t going for the elimination of Covid-19? No one would admit we were all aiming for zero. Well how the times have changed - here is what Victorian chief health officer Brett Sutton has to say: So just a huge thank you from me for ... everybody who has made a sacrifice through this period of lockdown. It is an awfully painful period, I have always had in mind that we need to do what is required to make sure that we get back down to zero. There is really no alternative. Our national strategy of aggressive suppression is there for a reason. If you do not get to zero, there is no grumbling along with one or two cases. This started with one case in Wollert that has led to almost 100 cases over a period of a few weeks. So we absolutely have to drive it back down to zero. But this has been the national strategy for a reason. It is what allows the travel bubble, what allows our internal borders to be open again. Foley is laying out the total case number for all the clusters across greater Melbourne. Here is where we stand for each of those different aspects of the outbreak, as of yesterday. In the city of Whittlesea outbreaks, we have identified 1500 primary close contacts to that outbreak, and the Port Melbourne outbreaks, we have seen 2100 primary close contacts. These numbers are continuing to fall each day as people finalise their quarantine period. And as these numbers fall, so to do the list of exposure sites linked to these aspects of the original part of this outbreak. There are now fewer than 200 exposure sites online, and we expect as sites and primary close contacts continue to be cleared, that this figure should continue to come down. In regards to the private residential aged care outbreaks, the Arcare Maidstone location, where we have seen 1057 primary close contacts, that number grew as a result of the case associated with the family member yesterday, and a number of those sites have been added as of yesterday. With the West Melbourne cluster, which is still moving and shifting, in fact, we have seen that number of primary close contacts grow to 1112, obviously the majority of test results which continue to come in from the outbreak have given the public health team the confidence they need to make these recommendations that the acting premier has just announced. So what about this person who was diagnosed today? Well, I’m glad you asked, and the Victorian health minister, Martin Foley, has some answers for you: So, today’s locally-acquired case is directly linked to the Stratton Finance workplace, and like many of these cases we are currently managing, this person was quarantining securely during their entire infectious period. Merlino finishes up his speech with a congratulations ... and a warning: Everyone should be absolutely proud of what we have all achieved together. But we know this isn’t over yet, and until we have widespread vaccination across Victoria and across our country, the virus will still be with us. So we can’t let complacency creep in, and I am asking everyone to keep doing the right thing. Follow the rules, check-in, get tested if you are feeling unwell. You know, we are into the depths of winter now. People will get the sniffles. Any symptoms, any symptoms, please go and get tested. That is the most important thing you can do, and if you are eligible, please get vaccinated. We are making some big steps today, we are announcing some big steps. This is a good day. Oh, and there is some extra business supports announced for the Victorian businesses that have missed out in this round of restrictions easing. Merlino: In terms of business support, with the restrictions easing for Melbourne, but I have just outlined, we know that some businesses, so, for Melbourne, like gyms, amusement parks, dance studios and nightclubs, they will need to remain closed for a little while longer stop that is why I am announcing a further $8.36 million to provide an additional $2000 grant to support thousands of businesses eligible for the business cost assistance program that remain closed under the restrictions that I am announcing today. Merlino foreshadows stricter QR code check-in requirements to come: Another thing that I want to put on people’s radar is in regards to QR codes. On the advice of the chief health officer, we will be moving to make QR check-ins compulsory for all workplaces, with very limited exemptions. Previously it has only been mandatory for customer-facing services, but through this outbreak we have seen a number of cases occur in office settings, so we want to take the next step on this. We will be looking to consult with industry over the next few days around implementation and we will finalise the details next week ahead of the requirements coming into effect. The acting premier has said that, if all goes to plan, the travel restrictions barring people in Melbourne moving around the rest of the state will be eased from next Thursday night. Merlino: We will have more to say about what the next stages of easing will look like next week, but I want to assure people that are subject to the public health advice, the epidemiological conditions through the next week, we expect to be, next Thursday night, that the original Metro divisions will come down and we will be able to travel more freely around the state again. For Melbourne, we will be looking to further ease restrictions on venues, community sport will be able to come back for competition, so again, this allows local sporting clubs to start planning for what the weekend after next looks like. We want to see what more can be done to further ease restrictions safely on businesses, without jeopardising the gains we have made, and we will be looking again to make some further changes for regional Victoria. Here is what will be changing from 11.59pm Thursday for regional Victoria. Merlino: The changes include visitors to homes, so that is limited to two adults per day, plus their dependents. Public gatherings will be increased to 20 people. Restaurants and cafes can open to a maximum of 150 per venue for seated service, including up to 75 allowed indoors. Religious ceremonies will be capped at 15o per venue. Funerals will be limited to 75 people, while weddings will be limited to 20. Offices will remain capped at 50%. Community sport is back for all ages, both for training and for competition in regional Victoria. Finally, regional Victorians will still be able to travel around regional Victoria, Melburnians will not. Here is what will be changing from 11.59pm Thursday for Melbourne: Merlino: The five reasons to leave home will no longer apply in metropolitan Melbourne. The existing 10km limit will be increased to 25km. That means the only reasons to go further than 25km will be for work, education, caregiving or getting a vaccination. Travel into regional Victoria still remains a no go for now. We are also still not in a position to be able to have visitors in our homes, but outdoor gatherings will be increased to a maximum of 10 people. Schools will be able to resume face-to-face learning from Friday. Which is great news for teachers, staff, students and parents. Masks will no longer be required outdoors unless you cannot maintain a 1.5 metre distance, but it is important that everyone continues to wear them indoors, whether that is shopping, on the train or at work. Funerals are limited to 50 people, weddings are limited to 10. Religious ceremonies will be capped at 50 people inside. Offices will be able to return with 25% or a cap of 10, whichever is greater. But we’re still asking people to work home where they can. Restaurants and cafes can reopen for seated service with up to 100 people per venue and a maximum of 50 inside. Retail can reopen in line with density limits of one person per four square metres. Beauty therapy can also resume for treatments where masks can be worn. Community sport can return to training in metropolitan Melbourne. Auctions can happen outdoors, with a maximum of 50 people. Some entertainment venues and community facilities will also open in line with density limits and additional caps, and they are in line with the current settings in regional Victoria. The acting premier, James Merlino, is announcing the easing of restrictions for Melbourne and regional Victoria now. Today, on the advice of the chief health officer, we can announce some significant steps. So, from 11:59pm tomorrow night, metropolitan Melbourne will move to most of the same settings currently in place across regional Victoria, and regional Victoria will move further towards further easing Australia’s most populous state capitals Melbourne and Sydney have plummeted down the list of the world’s most liveable cities. The Economist Intelligence Unit’s survey for 2021 rated Auckland, New Zealand as the most liveable city across the globe, ahead of Osaka, Japan, reports AAP. Melbourne had basked in the title for seven years and was in second place the last time the list was compiled in 2019. The Victorian city has now dropped to eighth, behind both Adelaide (third) and Perth (sixth), after enduring the nation’s longest Covid-19 lockdown last year. Brisbane has also entered the top 10. Despite enjoying some of the most relaxed restrictions across the nation, Sydney dropped from third to 11th in a similar dive to Melbourne. The index gave Melbourne 100% in infrastructure and education, while its healthcare (83.3) and culture and environment ratings (88.2) fell. Here is the top 10 list as it now stands (Don’t worry the numbering confuses me too): * 1. Auckland, New Zealand * 2. Osaka, Japan * 3. Adelaide, Australia * 4. Wellington, New Zealand * 4. Tokyo, Japan * 6. Zurich, Switzerland * 8. Geneva, Switzerland * 8. Melbourne, Australia * 10. Brisbane, Australia Okay, we are just standing by now from Victorian acting premier James Merlino to step up now. I swear, politicians have a bad reputation for being disingenuous and talking around the questions, but they have nothing on professional sports people. Say what you mean, Buckley! Say what you mean! No Covid-19 for NSW by the way! Ummmmm is it just me or is this... good graphic design choices from Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk? I need to go buy a lotto ticket, this is clearly a very special day. Ben Roberts-Smith will take the stand this morning in his defamation trial against three Australian newspapers who have accused him of war crimes. His trial will stay behind closed doors initially before the Victoria Cross recipient takes the stand in open court to give evidence about what he saw and did in Afghanistan. He is expected to answer questions about his actions on deployment with the SAS in Afghanistan. The newspapers have accused him of committing six murders, on five separate occasions, while on deployment. The first two days of the trial opening this week has heard from Roberts-Smith’s barrister, Bruce McClintock, who has sought to impugn those who have made allegations against Roberts-Smith as “fabulists” and “failed soldiers”. McClintock told the court: “[Roberts-Smith] has never killed anyone outside the rules of engagement ever. But before Roberts-Smith’s defamation trial begins day three, a parallel legal action he is bringing, suing his ex-wife Emma Roberts over alleged access to emails and other information, is also set to be heard before a different judge. Roberts-Smith claims his former wife had access to his email - and may have disclosed to others - confidential, sensitive or privileged material. Roberts-Smith, 42, is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times for defamation over a series of reports published in 2018 which he alleges are defamatory because they portrayed him as someone who “broke the moral and legal rules of military engagement” and committed war crimes, including murder. Roberts-Smith, a decorated former corporal in the SAS, has consistently denied the allegations as “baseless”, saying they were “completely without any foundation in truth”. Collingwood CEO Mark Anderson appears to be eulogising Nathan Buckley while sitting right next to Nathan Buckley. It’s all very awkward. Looking at the next three to five years. As those conversations unfolded and particularly over the last couple of weeks and the last few days with Graham and Nathan, it became clear that Nathan’s time as coach would finish this year and that we wouldn’t be going on into 2022. We will find the right time to honour and respect his amazing legacy to the club. He is a towering figure and legend of the club and we will respect that and provide our members and fans that opportunity of respecting that as well. We know all of our people and particularly our players will be doing their very best for Bucks and our club on Monday but it will be the last time that Bucks will be leading our players and our club on Monday afternoon. OK, the Zoom call Collingwood press conference about Nathan Buckley stepping down is starting now. A brilliant photo essay out today from Alana Holmberg. Super duper worth checking out on your morning coffee break! Speaking of pressers, we will be hearing from the acting premier, James Merlino, at 11.30am today where he is expected to confirm Melbourne will come out of lockdown from Friday. (With a number of restrictions still in place.) Nathan Buckley is to stand down as Collingwood coach midway through the AFL season as the club continues its large scale structural reform. A press conference has been called for 11am at which Buckley is expected to confirm his exit, having told the club’s football department and playing staff earlier this morning. Buckley’s last game in charge is expected to be against Melbourne at the SCG on the Queen’s birthday on Monday. Buckley, who has been in charge of the Pies since taking over from Mick Malthouse in 2012, becomes the second of Collingwood’s major figureheads to leave the club this year, following the departure of former president Eddie McGuire. It brings to an end months of speculation about his future, following a disappointing start to the season which has seen his side win just three games from 12 outings. The Pies currently sit 16th on the ladder. It is unclear who will take over the job on an interim basis, but he counts his assistants as Brenton Sanderson, Robert Harvey, Hayden Skipworth and Damian Carroll. Important news from Europe. Now I know nothing about AFL (or any sport in general), but luckily the fantastic Guardian Australia sports editor Mike Hytner will drop-in in a second and bring you all the important news about Collingwood coach Nathan Buckley reportedly stepping down. By the way, we are still waiting for a time to be confirmed for this Victorian press conference. I’ll let you know as soon as we know! (Seems like the acting premier is still deep in discussion this morning as he is MIA in parliament.) Whoops, looks like the Victorian Liberals have no plans on easing up the attacks on the Andrews government today. The Australian Medical Association is backing a digital coronavirus vaccination certificate for Australians vaccinated against coronavirus. People who have had both doses of Pfizer or AstraZeneca are able to access proof through their Medicare account, reports Matt Coughlan from AAP. Australian Medical Association president Omar Khorshid told ABC radio on Wednesday that allowing immunisation status to be shown on a screen without disclosing other private health information was a logical step. Australians need to be able to prove they are vaccinated one way or another... It’s going to be needed for international travel. It may well be needed in many workplaces. Yes, we do support a mechanism for you to demonstrate your vaccine status. The certificate has a coat of arms hologram and includes the person’s name, date of birth and a green tick of validity. No one will be required to share information about non-Covid vaccinations or other health data. Proof of immunisation is seen as vital to relaxing restrictions long term, with some businesses and political leaders floating it as an incentive to receive jabs. The government services minister, Linda Reynolds, said the new record would make it simple for people to show their vaccination status. The Covid-19 digital certificate makes proof of vaccination accessible anytime, anywhere. The certificate can be accessed through the Medicare app or online through myGov. Just a quick shout out to the artist whose artwork is featured in the header photo of the blog today. The piece is called “Spatial deconstruction #23 (resilience)“, so a fairly fitting photo for today’s news, and it’s by the fantastic Emma Coulter. If you are keen to see more of her work she has a super bright and fun Instagram page here. The Victorian truth and justice commission, the Yoo-rrook Justice Commission has named Dunghutti man Josh Smith as its inaugural CEO. The Yoo-rrook Justice Commission, announced in March, is preparing to conduct an inquiry into the ongoing effects of violent dispossession and genocide as part of the process to get to Treaty in Victoria. Commissioners have already been named. Smith is a career public servant — his previous roles include the deputy secretary of Aboriginal justice at the Victorian Department of Justice and Community. The announcement of his appointment said Smith would “assist the commissioners in helping them to achieve the commission’s objectives, including those related to truth-telling, educating the wider public and making recommendations for structural reform”. He starts on 21 June. If are keen to learn more about the Biloela family’s situation, and the timeline of medical care three-year-old Tharnicaa received, can I suggest this fantastic explainer from Melissa Davey and Josh Taylor: Priya Nadesalingam has become a fierce advocate for her young daughters – Tharnicaa, three, and Kopika, five, – since her family was taken from their central Queensland home in 2018 and put in detention after her and her husband’s visas had expired. Family friend Simone Cameron said Nadesalingam has had no choice but to fight for the girls, who were both born in Australia. The health of her daughters has significantly deteriorated since the family was moved to immigration detention by Border Force officials. Only allowed half an hour outside a day in the early months of detention, Tharnicaa and Kopika became vitamin D deficient and prone to repeated infections. Tharnicaa was two when her teeth were so rotten she needed surgery to have two of them removed. You can read the full timeline below: Queensland is (local) Covid-19 free as well by the way! Victoria’s acting premier, James Merlino, is expected to give a press conference mid-morning announcing that the lockdown in Melbourne will lift from midnight on Thursday. The Victorian government has not confirmed any of the conditions which will apply post-lockdown, and says it did not provide them. But it is not refuting reports in the Herald Sun which suggest that the post-lockdown conditions will include: A 25km travel limit for people in greater Melbourne to prevent people travelling to regional areas for the Queen’s Birthday long weekend. Students returning to the classroom as early as Friday. Outdoor gatherings limited to 10 people. Cafes and restaurants limited to 50 customers. Visitors to the home still banned. Gyms to remain closed. Mandatory face masks indoors. Density limits in offices. Again, these are not confirmed rules — but they appear pretty likely. It’s not clear yet how long they will remain in place. Some may be lifted after the long weekend. We’ll bring you all the official details once the announcement is made in a few hours. A Tamil asylum seeker family detained at a Christmas Island facility has had no communication with the federal government about the prospect of being sent to the US or New Zealand, reports AAP. The Murugappan family’s lawyer Carina Ford on Wednesday responded to suggestion the two countries were likely destinations, as the government continues to reject pleas they be allowed to remain in Australia. For the record we and our clients have not been approached about this by the government - we have written to the Department of Home Affairs to ask why. The family has been on the island, far off the West Australian coast, for two years after being removed by federal authorities from their home in Biloela, Queensland. The home affairs department had been threatening to send them back to Sri Lanka, despite the family’s pleas they would be targeted. On Tuesday, the home affairs minister, Karen Andrews, said “a range of resettlement options” were under negotiation. The foreign minister, Marise Payne, later expanded on that statement, saying the US and NZ were options. “I do know that the minister for home affairs, Ms Andrews, has indicated that there are two options there, and the United States and New Zealand are both in the frame,” she told Sydney radio 2GB. Vigils will be held outside the hospital in Perth on Wednesday evening, where the youngest daughter is being treated after being medically evacuated from Christmas Island, and at Sydney Town Hall on Thursday. Victoria has recorded just one new locally acquired case overnight, which the department of health has confirmed was linked to the current outbreak and was already quarantining. This absolutely bolsters the idea that Melbourne will be allowed out of lockdown from Friday. Massive mouse plague news! (The only news I care about) The NSW government will provide up to $100m in rebates to farmers purchasing the mouse control chemical zinc phosphide amid a plague of the rodent blighting rural and regional communities. NSW farmers will be offered a rebate of 50% on their purchase of zinc phosphide - which is already tax deductible - up to $10,000. This comes after the agriculture minister, Adam Marshall, had controversially focused the government’s response on getting a permit to use the currently agriculturally banned super-strong mouse killer bromadiolone. Last month the NSW government secured 5000 litres of the anti-coagulant, enough to treat about 95 tonnes of grain, to be provided to farmers for free once federal authorities approve its use. But environmentalist and the NSW Farmer’s Association were quick to express concerns about the extremely high secondary poisoning risk to native animals that comes with this poison. Unlike zinc phosphide, bromadiolone stays in a mouse’s body after death, placing all scavenger animals, such as owls, raptors, snakes, fish and even domestic pets, at risk. In a statement, Marshall said the government was also chipping in $5m to help transport zinc phosphide to Australia. Mice have been running rampant through large tracts of inland NSW and parts of southern Queensland since last year, destroying crops and causing significant damage to tonnes of stored hay and grain. In case anyone was wondering, the Victorian Liberals haven’t been totally chased out of town and were out and about again this morning. The Federal Court has ruled while most Greenpeace social media posts using energy provider, AGL’s logo next to the tagline “Australia’s greatest liability” fall under “fair dealing”, some lacked parody and therefore breached the company’s copyright. Basically ruling the environmental group has to be funnier or risk further legal action. Greenpeace launched a campaign in May while publishing a report detailing the provider’s responsibility for 8% of Australia’s carbon emissions. AGL sought an urgent injunction in the Federal Court, saying allegations of environmental wrongdoing were “unsubstantiated” and it wanted to protect its copyright, reports AAP. Greenpeace argued its use of the AGL logo should fall under “fair dealing” provisions in Australian copyright law as it is clearly satire or parody. While justice Stephen Burley agreed with the not-for-profit in his ruling on Tuesday, he said not every post was humoured enough for this to apply. The ridicule potent in the message is likely to be immediately perceived... Many would see these uses of the modified AGL logo as darkly humorous because the combined effect is ridiculous. AGL is exposed to ridicule by the use of its corporate imagery including by use of the modified AGL logo to convey a message that AGL would not wish to send. However, no satire was featured in a photo of a school student holding a poster that contained only the logo, the term “Australia’s Biggest Climate Polluter” and “Greenpeace”. That, and a handful of other social media posts and placards, did breach AGL’s copyright, Burley ruled. Greenpeace said the ruling was an affirmation that the law “is on the side of freedom of expression”, promising to continue pressuring AGL to close its coal-burning power stations by 2030. The energy giant welcomed the court’s ruling that its logo had been misused on some occasions and reiterated the case was about “the integrity of how our brand is used”. The parties will return to court on Thursday to address questions of costs and the form of injunctive relief. You can read Guardian Australia’s previous reporting on this court case here: If you were hanging out with me on the blog yesterday you might remember the (truly wild) decision from the Victorian Liberals to publish a list of questions about the Victorian premier Daniel Andrew’s March fall where he fractured his spine. There’s no point beating around the bush, it was a move that pretty clearly stoked the flames of conspiracy theories in the state and has been pretty broadly condemned. Well, now it’s time for the federal Liberals to pay the piper for their state counterparts, with the trade minister, Dan Tehan, being asked about it on ABC news breakfast this morning. Michael Rowland: You are a member of the Victorian Liberal Party, in fact a senior member of the Victorian party. What do you make of the grassy knoll conspiracy theories being circulated by the state opposition regarding the premier, Daniel Andrews’, back accident? Tehan: As I understand it, it wasn’t grassy knoll conspiracy theories. A series of questions were asked by the opposition... Look, the opposition in Victoria has the right to ask questions. That is what happens in a properly functioning democracy... Some of them I would prefer not to be asked, but they are and that is what happens in a properly functioning Liberal democracy and the Victorian opposition have the right to ask those questions... Rowland: Do you believe they are fair questions? Not if they are right. I am asking you, you are a senior member of the Victorian Liberal Party, Dan Tehan, do you believe they are fair questions? Tehan: The opposition has the right to ask questions. It is up to commentators to decide whether they are fair, whether they are not fair. They have the right to ask those questions and, can I say, I support Louise Staley asking requests as a member of the opposition in Victoria. That is what functioning Liberal parties are all about and good on Louise for asking requests as the opposition shadow treasurer. Dan Tehan is being grilled over the Biloela family’s situation after the foreign minister yesterday suggested the young family could be resettled in the UK or New Zealand rather than returning home to their rural town where the community has been protesting for years to get them back. (Take a sip of coffee for every time Tehan says “before the courts”: I saw her comments yesterday. I also know that this issue and this matter is before the courts, but [the foreign minister] has been pursuing that. Host Michael Rowland: Is there any prospect at all of this family being returned to their community in Biloela if Queensland? Tehan: Look, my understanding is that matter is before the courts, so therefore I won’t be commenting any further on it, but also my understanding is based on the comments that Marise Payne made yesterday that we are looking at other resettlement options... This is before the courts. I am not going to comment on a matter that is before the courts, so I’ll leave it there. The minister for trade, tourism and investment, Dan Tehan, is backing up the prime minister’s criticism of China this morning, discussing the need for global rules of trade. He is speaking with ABC News Breakfast now: What the PM is putting out quite clearly is that we do have a heightened strategic competition in the Indo-Pacific and it never has been a more important time for liberal democracies to get together and make sure that we are 100% becoming a rules-based order and to make sure when it comes to global trade that those global trade rules are there, that they are being adhered to and also, as with set new rules, it is bodies like the World Trade Organization that are setting those rules. It never has been a more important time to having all countries setting rules and making sure those rules are adhered to. More on ABC’s reports about today’s Melbourne lockdown announcements: We are hanging out on the blog this morning, but about 9pm last night we weren’t so sure there would even be a website to have a blog on today! Yep, let’s talk about the massive global server outage that took down most of Australia’s major news sites last night. Alex Hern and Dan Sabbagh have the details: One of the world’s biggest web outages should act as a “wake-up call” that internet infrastructure has become dangerously over-centralised and lacks resilience, security experts have warned. An unexplained configuration error at a single infrastructure provider, Fastly, which handles 10% of the world’s internet traffic, was enough to render major websites and services inoperable for almost an hour. Online businesses including Reddit, Amazon, Twitch, Spotify and Hulu were knocked offline, as was the Guardian’s website, the BBC, the New York Times, and CNN. National governments were also caught up: gov.uk was unavailable, making a host of government services inaccessible include the Covid vaccines booking site, as was the website for the White House. The affected sites all used Fastly as a content delivery network, a service intended to provide greater reliability and performance for heavily trafficked websites. You can read the full link below on our, thankfully functional, website: This hasn’t been independently confirmed by Guardian Australia but here is what the ABC is reporting will be the likely announcements on the end of Melbourne lockdown. It’s been suggested the city will move to a 25km travel bubble, with density limits in hospitality venues, and all students returning to the classroom. The ABC suggests that senior minister are meeting this morning to finalise plans so this could still change between now and the press conference. Scott Morrison is resisting international pressure to lock in more ambitious climate commitments, declaring Australia opposes setting targets for certain parts of the economy or “false deadlines for phasing out specific energy sources”. Before he sets off for the G7 summit in the UK later this week, the prime minister will use a foreign policy speech to say that “ambition alone won’t solve the problem of actually reducing emissions”. Morrison is also expected to characterise carbon border tariffs – an idea that is gathering momentum in international discussions as a way to avoid heavy-emitting industries shifting to countries with less ambitious climate commitments – as a “combative” protectionist measure. In an address to a thinktank in Perth on Wednesday, Morrison is expected to address tensions with China, saying Australia is “far from isolated” despite Beijing rolling out a series of trade actions against Australian export sectors over the past year. You can read more about Morrison’s upcoming G7 trip below: Hello, and a very good morning to you all. It’s Matilda Boseley here to take you through the news of Wednesday. First things first, we will likely get an update on the Melbourne lockdown today, with the current restrictions notionally slated to end at midnight tomorrow. Yesterday the acting premier, James Merlino, suggested that, barring any dramatic changes on Wednesday and Thursday, Melbourne was “on track” to ease restrictions at the end of the city’s second week of lockdown. We are still ... working through all the elements. It is a day-by-day, hour-by-hour analysis about how we are tracking … We remain on track to provide that easing of restrictions to all Victorians. But Merlino also flagged that this would not mean those living in the city could suddenly begin travelling around the state freely again, saying the bubble around Melbourne “will extend beyond any announcements that we will make later in the week”. This means we will be keeping a very close eye on today’s Victorian numbers, which are usually published around 9am, and I’ll bring you all the updates when the acting premier (presumably) appears before the media later this morning. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, will deliver a major foreign policy speech today ahead of a trip to the United Kingdom, where he will be a guest at the G7 meeting of world economic powers. Australia isn’t important enough to be an official member of this exclusive club, but countries like the US, Japan, Germany and the UK sometimes let us tag along like you would a younger sibling to a house party. But before Morrison jumps on a plane he will tell Perth’s USAsia Centre that regional infrastructure that comes with onerous conditions or is too expensive isn’t worth having. Projects should be high quality – and affordable. They should meet real need, and deliver sustainable economic benefits. And they should not compromise countries’ resilience or sovereignty. (We will go into detail about this later, but as usual it’s a not-so-subtle jab at China.) Well with that, why don’t we jump into the day!

The two-week lockdown will end at 11.59pm on Thursday but Melburnians must stay within 25km of home, meaning travelling for the Queen’s Birthday long weekend is not allowed. Students will be allowed to return to the classroom on Friday and restaurants and cafes will be allowed to have up to 100 customers for sit-down service, provided no more than 50 are indoors. Masks will still be mandatory indoors but will no longer be required to be worn outdoors where there is enough room to stand 1.5 metres apart. Outdoor gatherings of 10 people will be allowed, retail businesses can operate with some capacity restrictions, offices can return to 25% capacity, funerals can have 50 mourners and indoor religious ceremonies 50 worshipers, and weddings will be capped at 10 people. Beauty services will also be able to operate provided customers can wear masks and community sporting groups will be allowed to hold training. But gyms will stay closed and visitors to homes will not be allowed. The eased restrictions mean that Melbourne will no longer qualify as a coronavirus hotspot – so the federal Covid disaster payment will not be extended past Thursday, even though some people, such as those who work in gyms or nightclubs, will not be able to return to work. All workers will also be required to check into their workplace using a QR code – a response to one of the largest clusters in this outbreak being linked to a Port Melbourne accounting firm. In regional Victoria, restrictions will ease further to allow two guests per day in the home, outdoor gatherings of 20 people, an increase on the number of customers at a restaurant or cafe to 154 people, with no more than 75 indoors, funerals increasing to 75 people and weddings increasing to 20. The acting premier, James Merlino, said it was a “good day”. “But we know this isn’t over yet, and until we have widespread vaccination across Victoria and across our country, the virus will still be with us,” Merlino said. “So we can’t let complacency creep in, and I am asking everyone to keep doing the right thing.” He said the ban on travelling to regional Victoria should lift on Thursday next week, depending on public health advice. Further restrictions in Melbourne will be eased at the same time, he said. Merlino said Victoria was “absolutely keen to increase eligibility” for coronavirus vaccinations in Victoria to those under the age of 40, or to priority groups such as teachers, but does not have enough supply. He said that Victoria was delivering 40% of all vaccines in Australia and had a 93% utilisation rate – meaning 7% was being wasted. “We are at capacity,” he said. “If there is a greater level of supply and even more confidence in the supply going forward then we can increase eligibility but at the moment, we are absolutely running at capacity and every vaccine we are getting, we’re putting into peoples’ arms.” Merlino announced a further $8.36m in support for businesses which are not allowed to open, including gyms, dance clubs and amusement parks, which will be eligible for a top-up grant of $2,000. The Victorian chief health officer, Prof Brett Sutton, said restrictions were being eased slowly to ensure there were no undetected chains of transmission. Health authorities still haven’t discovered the transmission link between the South Australian quarantine breach and the first Wollert case reported in late May, and the Victorian hotel quarantine case and the West Melbourne Delta outbreak. “The Delta variant is one in particular that is obviously being discovered through people coming forward for testing which doesn’t have that intermediary case, necessarily, with hotel quarantine,” he said. Sutton said he hoped restrictions in Melbourne would be able to be eased further in eight days, but it “remains a reasonably volatile situation”. “The idea of a snap back to absolutely no restrictions whatsoever, no one has done that after significant community transmission,” Sutton said. “It didn’t happen after Avalon [the Sydney northern beaches outbreak], it hasn’t happened after other significant community outbreaks, and so we have to move by increments, safely, but with the minimum restrictions that we know will continue to control this.” He said he knew that lockdown was “an awfully painful period”. “I have always had in mind that we need to do what is required to make sure that we get back down to zero,” he said. “There is really no alternative.

If you do not get to zero, there is no grumbling along with one or two cases. “This started with one case in Wollert that has led to almost 100 cases over a period of a few weeks. So we absolutely have to drive it back down to zero.” The Victorian Liberal party introduced a bill to state parliament on Wednesday to force the disclosure of public health advice, saying decisions had been made with an “unacceptable level of secrecy”. Merlino said claims there had been a lack of transparency were “a complete myth pedalled by the Liberals.” He pointed to Sutton’s appearance at Wednesday’s press conference, along with many others, as a sign of the government’s transparency. The new case reported on Wednesday is a person who was already isolating as a close contact of the Stratton Finance cluster. The Victorian health minister, Martin Foley, said there were 2,100 close contacts of that cluster still in isolation and 1,500 of the outbreak first identified in the City of Whittlesea. There were also 1,057 close contacts isolating as a result of the outbreak in the Arcare Maidstone aged care home, and 1,112 isolating as contacts of the West Melbourne cluster. “These numbers are continuing to fall each day as people finalise their quarantine period,” he said. “And as these numbers fall, so do the list of exposure sites linked to these aspects of the original part of this outbreak.” The number of exposure sites has fallen to 200 from a high of more than 300.","charCount":"6172","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/calla-wahlquist\">Calla Wahlquist</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/jun/09/country-diary-the-swan-who-sits-on-silence","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-09T04:30:39Z","webTitle":"Country diary: the swan who sits on silence ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jun/09/country-diary-the-swan-who-sits-on-silence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/jun/09/country-diary-the-swan-who-sits-on-silence","fields":{"headline":"Country diary: the swan who sits on silence ","standfirst":"<p><strong>Sandy, Bedfordshire: </strong>In his half-vigil, the male never plays any part in this pointless nest maintenance, nor does he incubate the eggs</p>","trailText":"<strong>Sandy, Bedfordshire: </strong>In his half-vigil, the male never plays any part in this pointless nest maintenance, nor does he incubate the eggs","byline":"Derek Niemann","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0882cf47b0dfb64cef25e871b81ef2358a1276a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0882cf47b0dfb64cef25e871b81ef2358a1276a5/0_133_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Swan ‘gardening’ with her mate in attendance\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Swan ‘gardening’ with her mate in attendance.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Niemann</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>For too many weeks people have stopped at the river bend to look.

Since Covid-19 vaccines became available in Australia from February, some doctors have expressed frustration that strict rules around the promotion and advertising of medicines enforced by drugs regulator the Therapeutic Goods Administration has meant they could not promote the vaccines as freely as they would have liked, including directly to patients during consults, or on social media. The regulations are important because they prevent drugs companies and health professionals from making exaggerated claims about medicines and medical devices, and stop drug companies from advertising prescription drugs directly to consumers including through television, radio and social media. But the regulations have also made vaccine promotion difficult during the pandemic. In response, the TGA amended the rules, though only for the promotion of Covid-19 vaccines. While health professionals, corporate entities and media outlets can now communicate information publicly about TGA-approved Covid-19 vaccines, this information must be consistent with current commonwealth health messaging. Any promotion must not reference brand names such as Pfizer or AstraZeneca or any active ingredients that might identify the vaccines. The rules do not allow any statements saying vaccines do not cause harm, or any false or misleading information. But the changes do allow health professionals, corporate entities and media outlets to offer cash or other rewards to people who have been fully vaccinated. Rewards must not include alcohol, tobacco or medicines, however, listed medicines are allowed. Listed medicines are those that don’t require regulatory categorisation into pharmacy-only or prescription-only substances, and are available widely including in pharmacists but also in supermarkets. Listed products are mostly complementary and alternative products such as vitamins, minerals and homeopathic treatments, unproven to have any medical benefit. “Complementary medicines immune boosters are going gangbusters at the moment due to the pandemic,” Harvey said. Unless people have a specific vitamin deficiency, “they don’t work”, he said. “They don’t boost your immunity, but they’re a wonderful money-earner for pharmaceutical and vitamin companies.

My concern is the industries like naturopathy and homeopathy will benefit, and you’ll see pharmacists giving free samples of these products alongside the vaccinations to try to entice customers back.” The TGA rule changes will remain in effect until December 2022. Advertising and public health communication experts have previously called for rewards to be offered to boost vaccination rates following concerns that vaccine hesitancy and lacklustre government advertising were leading to complacency about getting vaccinated. Such rewards are being offered around the world including in the US, where Washington state is distributing marijuana to the vaccinated in a ‘Joints for Jabs’ program, while Ohio has seen vaccination rates surge after offering entry into a US$1m lottery. But Harvey said he was disappointed rewards were needed to entice people to do something in the interest of their own and the public’s health. “It’s true the Australian government has been so bad at

They have typically worked as interpreters, drivers, security staff and administrators. </p> <p>But campaigners argue the eligibility time-frame has to go further back than just the past two years and that applicants should not have to offer their own individual proof that they have been threatened, as the government is currently demanding.</p> <p>Germany has been involved in military operations in Afghanistan since 2001 and has just over 1,000 troops stationed there.</p> <p>Government sources cited by German media, have said that all 520 have submitted “endangered notices” to government authorities in Afghanistan and it has set up contact centres in both Mazar-i-Sharif and Kabul, where Afghans who have worked with Germans can submit a visa application. The location of the centres has not been made public for security reasons, which supporters of the applicants say, serves to stress the potential danger in which the Afghans find themselves.</p> <p>Signatories to the letter include two former German ambassadors to Afghanistan, the former inspector general of the Bundeswehr, leading aid workers and Marcus Grotian, a captain in the German military who served in Afghanistan and is chair of the Patronage network of the Afghani Local Workforce. He told German TV channel ARD: “This is not about whether someone is being shortchanged, but about whether he faces death.”</p> <p>The group has also criticised the government’s insistence that those affected should arrange and pay for their own travel and recommended instead that the Afghans are flown out of the country on specially arranged flights under military protection ahead of its withdrawal.</p> <p>A German relocation policy has been in place to relocate Afghan workers since 2013, after it was decided that the Bundeswehr would withdraw from Kundus in the north of the country. The government brought about 800 local workers to safety in Germany, but faced criticism that it had failed to help many hundreds of others.</p> <p>The German government has also been keen to stress the importance of Afghans staying in their homeland wherever possible, to help with its development, for which it is providing grants for employment training and education.</p> <p>Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, last week stressed the government’s commitment to supporting the military’s former local workers. A spokesperson said: “The government takes the concerns of Afghan local hire very seriously,” and said applications were being processed as “speedily and flexibly” as possible. In the case of an individual proved to be in danger, “it will be made possible for the local workers and their core families to be given a quick admittance to Germany”.</p> <p>The Taliban have widely branded Afghans who have been in the pay of foreign military “traitors” and “unbelievers”, or as “slaves of the invaders” or “collaborators” of the west. Many of those who have stayed in the country have complained of regular threats faced by them and their families and killings and torture of former employees have been well documented.</p> <p>The Taliban on Monday issued a statement urging people who had worked with foreign forces to stay in Afghanistan following the departure of Nato troops. It said that those who had supported non-Afghan military over the past two decades would “not be in any danger” as long as they were “remorseful” and would “not engage in such activities in the future”.

High-ranking representatives from the military, politics, development aid and the diplomatic corps have joined an appeal to the German government stressing the urgency of acting ahead of the withdrawal of international troops next month. “While the troops have long been preparing for their return, under increased security measures, the fears of the Afghans hired locally are growing,” states the letter, which was organised by the director of the Berlin-based independent thinktank Afghanistan Analysts Network, Thomas Rutter. An estimated 520 Afghans who are currently working or who have worked closely with the German military, the Bundeswehr, in Afghanistan over the past two years, as well as close family members, are potentially eligible for resettlement, if they can prove in their applications that they have been threatened by the Taliban because of their association. They have typically worked as interpreters, drivers, security staff and administrators. But campaigners argue the eligibility time-frame has to go further back than just the past two years and that applicants should not have to offer their own individual proof that they have been threatened, as the government is currently demanding. Germany has been involved in military operations in Afghanistan since 2001 and has just over 1,000 troops stationed there. Government sources cited by German media, have said that all 520 have submitted “endangered notices” to government authorities in Afghanistan and it has set up contact centres in both Mazar-i-Sharif and Kabul, where Afghans who have worked with Germans can submit a visa application. The location of the centres has not been made public for security reasons, which supporters of the applicants say, serves to stress the potential danger in which the Afghans find themselves. Signatories to the letter include two former German ambassadors to Afghanistan, the former inspector general of the Bundeswehr, leading aid workers and Marcus Grotian, a captain in the German military who served in Afghanistan and is chair of the Patronage network of the Afghani Local Workforce. He told German TV channel ARD: “This is not about whether someone is being shortchanged, but about whether he faces death.” The group has also criticised the government’s insistence that those affected should arrange and pay for their own travel and recommended instead that the Afghans are flown out of the country on specially arranged flights under military protection ahead of its withdrawal. A German relocation policy has been in place to relocate Afghan workers since 2013, after it was decided that the Bundeswehr would withdraw from Kundus in the north of the country. The government brought about 800 local workers to safety in Germany, but faced criticism that it had failed to help many hundreds of others. The German government has also been keen to stress the importance of Afghans staying in their homeland wherever possible, to help with its development, for which it is providing grants for employment training and education. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, last week stressed the government’s commitment to supporting the military’s former local workers. A spokesperson said: “The government takes the concerns of Afghan local hire very seriously,” and said applications were being processed as “speedily and flexibly” as possible. In the case of an individual proved to be in danger, “it will be made possible for the local workers and their core families to be given a quick admittance to Germany”. The Taliban have widely branded Afghans who have been in the pay of foreign military “traitors” and “unbelievers”, or as “slaves of the invaders” or “collaborators” of the west. Many of those who have stayed in the country have complained of regular threats faced by them and their families and killings and torture of former employees have been well documented. The Taliban on Monday issued a statement urging people who had worked with foreign forces to stay in Afghanistan following the departure of Nato troops. It said that those who had supported non-Afghan military over the past two decades would “not be in any danger” as long as they were “remorseful” and would “not engage in such activities in the future”. It urged those with skills to offer, to stay and “serve” their country. The group added: “If they are using the danger as an excuse to bolster their fake asylum case, then that is their own problem.” The German government is wary of giving too much publicity to the relocation scheme, not least because of political sensitivities surrounding its deportation programme of Afghans who have arrived in Germany as refugees but who face deportation after their asylum applications have been turned down, sometimes because they have been involved in criminal activity. It is cautious about not wanting to undermine its own argument that it is now safe to return to Afghanistan. The latest group was due to be returned to Kabul on Tuesday amid fierce protests from human rights groups.","charCount":"5251","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/kateconnolly\">Kate Connolly</a> in Berlin"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2021/jun/09/uk-role-fight-against-corruption-g7-cornwall","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-09T04:00:39Z","webTitle":"How the UK lost its leading role in the global fight against corruption","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/09/uk-role-fight-against-corruption-g7-cornwall","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/jun/09/uk-role-fight-against-corruption-g7-cornwall","fields":{"headline":"How the UK lost its leading role in the global fight against corruption","standfirst":"<p>The UK last hosted the G7 in 2013 but progress on David Cameron’s grand plans has been woeful</p>","trailText":"The UK last hosted the G7 in 2013 but progress on David Cameron’s grand plans has been woeful","byline":"Patrick Wintour  Diplomatic Editor","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"95a87b5df7868305e66df0935b5101cc7d201993\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95a87b5df7868305e66df0935b5101cc7d201993/0_0_2880_1728/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Cameron pictured with Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin at the G8 summit at Lough Erne in 2013.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Cameron pictured with Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin at the G8 summit at Lough Erne in 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Cardy/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>The last time the UK chaired a summit of the G7, or the G8 as it was in 2013, David Cameron was in an ebullient mood as he held a closing press conference in glorious late afternoon sunshine by Lough Erne in Northern Ireland.

Boris Johnson at his G7 summit in Cornwall this week will make much of the fight to defeat authoritarianism in Russia and China, but in doing so he will have to gloss over the role of the City, overseas territories and the London property market in facilitating the Russian kleptocracy. His hostility towards the recommendations from the long-delayed report by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/21/just-what-does-the-uk-russia-report-say-key-points-explained\">parliament’s intelligence and security committee on Russian influence</a> is impossible to overlook. Tom Keatinge, director of the centre for financial studies at the British defence thinktank Royal United Services Institute, warns that “when the tide goes out you find out who is swimming naked. For Boris Johnson and illicit finance that embarrassing moment is about to arrive.”</p> <p>Britain’s recent inertia is likely to be seen as more than a minor domestic broken promise. Corruption is rapidly surging back up the global agenda, largely thanks to America. Joe Biden has said the competition between autocracy and democracy is the great generational challenge, and he plans “to rally our allies to combat corruption and kleptocracy”. Tackling global corruption is not a distraction from dealing with China, Russia and other strategic competitors, but central to it. On Thursday, Biden announced that fighting corruption is a “core national security interest, and essential to the preservation of our democracy”.</p> <p>Inside the US national security council, Samantha Power, the head of <a href=\"https://www.usaid.gov/\">USAID</a>, has been pressing the issue hard, arguing the common thread that animates so many demonstrations from Jakarta to Pretoria is anger with corruption. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/07/g7-tax-reform-what-has-been-agreed-and-which-companies-will-it-affect\">the minimum 15% corporate tax rate, agreed by the G7 at the weekend</a> and made possible by Donald Trump’s defeat, means that more ways must be found to stop firms hiding their profits in tax havens.</p> <p>The UN general assembly last week held a three-day conference on fighting corruption, its first such summit. The role of “enablers”, by which they meant London lawyers as much as anyone, was one of the main targets of the assembly’s 17-page communique.</p> <p>So quite how Cameron’s G8 ambitions dissipated is not just another reminder of how fleeting the fads can be at these summits, or how all summit declarations are “here today, binned tomorrow”.</p> <p>Armed by his G8 success in 2013, Cameron in May 2016 went one stage further, bringing together world leaders for a one-day conference at Lancaster House on fighting corruption, the first of its kind. Most still recall the event for Cameron being overhead at a reception saying he had invited the leaders of some of the “most fantastically corrupt countries”. But it brought together 43 world leaders and between them they generated 648 commitments, 17% of which were on the topic of beneficial ownership of shares, widely seen as the golden key to unlock corruption.</p> <p>“It seemed a global moment when the world seemed to be coming together to take this issue seriously,” recalls Liz David-Barrett, director for the study of corruption at Sussex University. Robert Barrington, then chief executive of Transparency International, recalls he never knew a moment when an NGO worked so closely with the top of government in the 30-year anti-corruption movement. “The closer we got into the process, there was not a diminishing hunger for ideas from No 10, but an increase. It showed that you could have a global anti-corruption moment that does not have to be mired in the UN.”</p> <p>But then two months later, the Brexit vote happened, Cameron departed and summit organisers now admit Whitehall collectively dropped the ball on the issue. The senior Cabinet Office civil servant coordinating the anti-corruption summit in Whitehall, Creon Butler, recalls: “It was not as if Theresa May had any problem fighting corruption, but with Brexit, she had other priorities and it was not right at the top of the list in the way it had been with Cameron.”</p> <p>In May’s defence, she took the issue to the G20 summit in Brisbane in 2016 where 10 principles on beneficial ownership were adopted. But Butler admits leaders have only so much bandwidth, and cannot take five different issues to a summit. Her priority was modern slavery. “If we had the follow up, we would have got a lot more through. That is where we fell down,” Butler recalls.</p> <p>Barrington argues the UK did not just fall behind solely due to the distraction of Brexit. He points out: “In 2008 in the wake of the financial crash, the UK introduced its golden visa regime. 60% of these visas – unchecked, no real diligence – went to citizens of Russia and China. That was a deliberate policy, not to promote corruption, but to get inward investment at a time when the economy was in trouble. The truth is post-Covid, post-Brexit, the UK economy is going to have a pretty rough ride. The government might not want to close off avenues that bring inward investment to the UK or allow exports to new markets where levels of corruption are pretty high. The government will never explicitly say that, but there is a realpolitik to this.”</p> <p>There are now tentative recent signs that the Foreign Office, never central to Cameron’s more Cabinet Office-based initiative, is willing to pick up the fumbled ball, and show leadership. This year’s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/global-britain-in-a-competitive-age-the-integrated-review-of-security-defence-development-and-foreign-policy\">integrated defence and foreign policy review</a>, for instance, addressed some issues around illicit finance and insecurity.</p> <p>At the UK’s instigation, the G7 put out a supportive if general statement for the UN general assembly event last week.

Johnson has in effect been given his orders, and he could start by revisiting what Cameron, his great Conservative rival, proposed all those years ago.","charCount":"11037","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/patrickwintour\">Patrick Wintour</a>  Diplomatic Editor"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2021/jun/09/jakarata-river-foam-cause-indonesia-marunda","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-09T03:31:34Z","webTitle":"Troubled waters: what’s causing the mystery foam in a Jakarta canal?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/09/jakarata-river-foam-cause-indonesia-marunda","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/jun/09/jakarata-river-foam-cause-indonesia-marunda","fields":{"headline":"Troubled waters: what’s causing the mystery foam in a Jakarta canal?","standfirst":"<p>The froth has spilled out of a canal in Marunda repeatedly over recent years, but the exact cause is unknown</p>","trailText":"The froth has spilled out of a canal in Marunda repeatedly over recent years, but the exact cause is unknown","byline":"Rebecca Ratcliffe South-east Asia correspondent","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ff7d007d8c27b9bed67fd4a8cecdde5f37d8a7b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff7d007d8c27b9bed67fd4a8cecdde5f37d8a7b1/0_422_6325_3795/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Foaming waste spills from the Marunda sluice gate in Jakarta.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Foaming waste spills from the Marunda sluice gate in Jakarta, Indonesia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aslam Iqbal/Sopa Images/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>A blanket of thick, snow-like foam covers the surface of a canal in Indonesia’s capital, Jakarta.

The froth has exuded from the waters of the east flood canal in Marunda repeatedly over recent years, usually in the rainy season. Similar pollution has plagued waters in India, including Delhi’s sacred Yamuna River, which has been coated in toxic froth caused by untreated waste, chemicals and pollutants. In Jakarta, liquid waste, including detergent from homes and nearby factories, has been blamed. The exact cause of the recent foam in Marunda isn’t clear, said Muharram Atha Rasyadi, urban campaigner for Greenpeace Indonesia, though the most common contributors to river pollution in Jakarta were household waste and littering. “During the rainy season, usually waste contamination in the river, like plastic waste, increases due to the higher flow from upstream,” he said. “We need more and adequate waste water treatment within the city.

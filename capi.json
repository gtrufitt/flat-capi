Hampshire continue to edge forward, just 206 behind. They‚Äôve taken tea at Sophia Gardens, with the promise of an entertaining run-chase to toast day. Invaluable nurdling from Saqib Mahmood and Danny Lamb at the end. Neser 4-53, two each for Lamb and Douthwaite. Northants knew what they were up to yesterday, banging out four bonus points while the sun shone. Pennington back in the wickets at New Road, with numbers 7 and 9. Durham lead by 219. Warwickshire are a-crumbling in their second innings. Currently 5-2 after four overs, with Pieter Malan and Will Rhodes‚Äôs afternoon closed. The lead 159. Teenage kicks: Yorkshire 130-2. Follow on NOT enforced by Warwickshire, who bat again with a first-innings lead of 153. Meanwhile Sam Northeast has tacked together a valuable fifty at Taunton, paying what I think they described as a ‚Äúholding-role‚Äù in football. Hampshire 124-5. Not many centuries this round (Brown, Harris and Bedingham, I think), but another beauty from Bedingham who is providing welcome heft to the Durham middle order. The lead over Worcestershire now 202. The last wicket stand added a sixth of the runs after a collapse of 8-45. Norwell 4-24, Miles 5-30. Will they follow on? We wait.... Still no play at Kent, Chelmsford or Lord‚Äôs. For balance, the top ten leading wicket-takers this season: Rushworth (Durham) 37 Coverton (Somerset) 36 Fletcher (Notts) 36 Abbott (Hants) 34 Harmer (Esses) 34 Higgins (Gloucs) 33 Sam Cook (Essex) 32 Carse (Durham) 32 Olly Robinson (Sussex) 29 Bamber (Middx) 28 [Broad has 19 from four games, Wood 10 from three games, Anderson 3 in two games but one innings] Hampshire 110-5, as James Hildreth at slip says thank you to a softly-dropping plum from Liam Dawson. Ah! Thank you Gary. O youth! The strength of it, the faith of it, the imagination of it! Ibrahim strikes with ball. Kohler-Cadmore lbw for 25. Yorkshire 83-1. Like a moonlit shadow, Derbyshire dance where Lancashire tread. From 76-2 to 98-7. Craig Miles 4-26, Norwell 2-20. A breakthrough at Taunton! James Vince is caught at backward point after an uncharacteristically patient 29. Hampshire 100-4. I‚Äôve learnt that Dan Ibrahim is now the youngest player to make fifty on debut in the Championship. The previous record was held by Bilal Shafayat - who in my mind played a Test for England, but my mind is wrong. Cricinfo confirms U19 England caps and a glorious season in 2005 when he made 1000 runs for Notts. Gosh Lancashire really are, um, getting a move on. They‚Äôve now lost 5-11, with Vilas and Bailey joining the heavy pavilion-trudge. Three for Neser, one for Douthwaite and a run out. Currently, 125-8, a lead of 148. That run-out : And a reminder of the owner of that mellifluous welsh voice: Eddie Bevan of course. Thank you! Hopes of a tea-start at Lord‚Äôs Glamorgan‚Äôs statement on welcoming fans back to Sophia Gardens: We welcome today‚Äôs announcement from the Welsh Government of a return of spectators to watch live events in Wales this summer. The two metre social distancing regulation will restrict our capacity to a maximum of 2,892 and we will continue to work closely with key partners including the Welsh Government, Public Health Wales, and Cardiff City Council on a safe return of fans to Sophia Gardens. We have prepared and submitted proposals for a phased return of fans to Sophia Gardens from next week and look forward to providing more information as soon as the necessary approvals have been confirmed. Once again, we would like to thank our members, fans and partners for their patience and look forward to welcoming supporters back to Sophia Gardens in greater numbers. Gary Naylor confirms a Lancs-up in progress. Here‚Äôs the first of the three to fall since lunch: A post-lunch trickle: Madsen and McDermot shot out by Miles (3-23) at Derby: 82-4, 192 behind Warwicks. Chris Wright picked off by Hammond at the run-fest at Grace Road, Leicestershire 439-8. Oh dear, and Lancashire have lost 3-4 at Sophia Gardens: Bohannon, Livingstone, and Wood run-out without facing a ball. Lancs 113-6. Just watered the garden for the first-time in a while, cautiously optimistic about the soft-fruit season. Talking of which... ah, no-one has collapsed in the ten minutes since lunch. Group one Derby: Derbyshire 61-2 v Warwicks 274 Chelmsford: Essex v Notts 248-6 no play before lunch Worcester: Worcester 131 all out v Durham 252-4 Group two Grace Road: Leicestershire 436-7 v Gloucestershire Taunton: Somerset 360 all out v Hampshire 67-3 Group three Sophia Gardens: Glamorgan 150 all out v Lancashire 173 and 88-3 Canterbury: Kent v Northamptonshire 362-5 no play before lunch Headingley: Yorkshire 26-0 v Sussex 313 all out Godleman straggles back to the Derby pavilion after being caught behind for 32. Derby 61-2 shortly before lunch. At Headingley, the Yorkshire openers are still whole, if with an uneven scorecard. Kohler Cadmore one not out; Lyth 16 not out including a morning heave-ho for six! Yorks 22-0. David Bedingham is the only man with more than 700 runs this season - and still he bats. Currently 65 not out at New Road as Durham sail into a sobering lead: 241-4, a lead of 112 over Worcestershire. Al Davies and Luke Wells steaming along at Sophia Gardens, but Keaton Jennings‚Äô more circumspect innings is over. Lbw to Weighell for 12. A bump down to earth in this game after his classy hundred last week. Lancashire 72- hang on, they‚Äôre now 72-2. Wells bowled for 26 by Douthwaite. Sussex all out 313! Now Yorkshire get a go. Will it be the Yorkshire of the first innings of the Roses match -159 all out - or the Yorkshire who battled to so-close to the bitter end in the second innings? This is just showing off! Gloucestershire having a spell in the doldrums. Leicester now 411-7, with a helpful 47 extras. And, in case this appeals: No dream debut for Ibrahim, but dreamy enough. Well played, young pup. Sussex 310-8. Lunch will be taken at 1pm at Lord‚Äôs, where the rain continues to pour. Hampshire, meanwhile, are in trouble: 31-3 after de Lange removes Steel and Alsop in one over. Holland already gone, caught VDM off Davey. Just perusing the Championship averages as if it was 1985 and they were taking up a whole page in the Telegraph. The highest England players are 7th placed Ollie Pope (78.83) and 8th placed Rory Burns (53.73) Top ten: Van der Merwe, Somerset Bedingham, Durham Carlson, Glamorgan RS Patel, Surrey MS Harris, Leicestershire Vasconcelos, Northants Pope, Surrey Burns, Surrey MAH Hammond, Gloucestershire Abell, Somerset Derbyshire have lost their first wicket, 8-1, but Durham billow onwards, Beingham and Jones steadfast in a partnership of fifty. Their lead over Worcestershire an almost commanding 53, with six wickets remaining. The lovely voice of the Glamorgan commentator is lulling me into a trance, but can report that at Derby Warwickshire are all out for 274, an impressive effort by Derby, who are already batting and 7-0. There will be an inspection at Canterbury at 12.20. How‚Äôs that on debut?! Seven fours and as calm as a tarn on an early spring morning. Ticket offer!!! Brian Withington has very kindly offered two free tickets for England v New Zealand at Edgbaston next Friday June 11th to a lucky BTL-er. If you are interested, please email me at tanya.aldred.freelance@theguardian.com and I can put the two of you in touch. There is a Covid consent form that should be completed ASAP and a lateral flow test requirement as condition of entry. An email wafts in with the jasmine. It‚Äôs from Finbar Anslow: ‚ÄúHello Tanya, Just wanted to let you know how wonderful my yesterday was. Cutting the grass and only stopping to check scores when I found a bit of shade (memo, plant more trees) So lovely to watch Lewis Gregory score a ton and the Marchant of menace in action. However even in paradisiacal Piedmont the occasional question flutters through one‚Äôs thoughtless contemplation........Why is Reina del Cid‚Äôs Harvest moon so damned good?Was Edward Snowden right? Is there a file on each and every one of us, just awaiting a moment of fame for our sins to be exposed.Should Somerset send their bowlers in to open the batting? Any enlightenment gratefully received At Headingley, Ben Coad grabs Sussex‚Äôs main man, centurion Ben Brown. Sussex 275-6 with 16-year -old Ibrahim not out 43. He‚Äôs ‚Äúdoing a Conway.‚Äù Lancashire not hanging around. This could be all over today at the Gardens. Jennings and Davies march back out, Davies is off the mark with four and Lancashire are 6-0, with a first-innings lead of 23. And Ali‚Äôs nice report on Conway, Wood, Robinson, Root and co And Simon Burnton on the fallout from the Robinson affair. We‚Äôre rolling! Except at Canterbury, Chelmsford and Lord‚Äôs where the rain doth spout and spoil things. Some fabulous reading from the Test. I thought this was brilliant on Ollie Robinson by Andy Bull. On a morning of cloud cover so heavy that the Headingley floodlights were switched on, and 2,056 souls planted their behinds around the ground for the first time for a men‚Äôs county game since 2019, Yorkshire chose to bowl. With Sussex 68 for four just after lunch, it seemed a good decision. By stumps, less so, thanks to a smashing unbeaten 126 from Ben Brown, 40 from Aaron Thomason and a cameo of 37 from 16-year-old Danial Ibrahim. Brown played with nimble feet and hands, running swiftly between the wickets and driving with panache, picking the gaps ably, like a pick-happy man with an orange pith obsession. Ibrahim was sighingly calm, straight drive here, flick there, making the most of late-afternoon Yorkshire bowling with the new ball that touched on the wayward. Northamptonshire, the gluttons, bolted down four batting points before the close in a riotous day‚Äôs batting against Kent. Ricardo Vasconcelos and Emilio Gay put on 135 for the first wicket, before Gay, who made his maiden first-class century, and Luke Procter added 100 for the second. Darren Stevens, aged 45, picked up a couple of wickets with the second new ball to lead a mini-revival at the close. There were two catches for Kent‚Äôs wicketkeeper Ollie Robinson, who received an apology from Kent Online, who had mistakenly pictured him in Wednesday‚Äôs story about the other Ollie Robinson. Lancashire were squirrelled out by Glamorgan for 173 after a succession of batsmen got in, but then got out again, without adding greatly to the score. Tom Bailey scored a quickfire 31 to raise spirits, before picking up three wickets, as did Sajid Mahmood, as Glamorgan collapsed to 150 for nine.

Worcestershire crumbled for 131 at New Road as Brydon Carse and Matty Potts snaffled four wickets each. Durham ended the day leading by nine with six wickets in hand, bolstered by 52 from Alex Lees. Fifties from Lyndon James, Steven Mullaney and Joe Clarke, who restarted his innings after retiring hurt, inched Nottinghamshire on to the front foot against Essex. Peter Siddle finished with three for 76. Sam Hain (77) and Michael Burgess (71) kept Warwickshire afloat on a muggy day at Derbyshire. Sam Conners had the top order in a pickle, taking the first four wickets, before the middle-order solidified to see them towards 272 for nine at stumps.

However, Pavlyuchenkova played an excellent match, was far more consistent than her opponent, who produced a litany of unforced errors and is knocked out. At least Sabalenka will be able to say she took her shots on, and went down all guns blazing, even if blazing in accurately for the most part.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-06-04T10:53:32.880Z\">at 11.53am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-60ba05188f082ac930aea110\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-04T10:49:26.505Z\">11.49am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Sabalenka</strong> edges to 30-30 with Pavlyuchenkova serving for the match.

Williams and Collins, meanwhile, are with serve at 3-3 in the first. Medvedev leads Opelka 5-1, closing on a two-set lead in under an hour. Opelka booms down a couple of big serves as he tries to stay in the second set. Giron hits back against Garin on Court 7 and takes the second set 7-5. Garin won the first 6-1. Out on Court 14, another women‚Äôs singles match has just got under way: Sorana Cirstea (ranked 54) v Daria Kasatkina (ranked 37). Williams and Collins are locked at 2-2 in the first on Court Philippe-Chatrier. Medvedev breezes to a 3-0 lead in the second set against the man-mountain Opelka. Medvedev is outclassing Opelka, he‚Äôs 2-0 up in the second set, having taken the first 6-4. Williams, meanwhile, makes Collins work to hold her second service game of the match. Collins, who is ranked 50, eventually does so and leads 2-1 in the first, with serve. Check out this Medvedev return. Tasty. The seventh seed Serena Williams - three times a women‚Äôs singles champion at Roland Garros - is on court and in action against Danielle Rose Collins, who also hails from the USA. Collins has held serve and is 1-0 up so far, with Williams in her first service game as I type. Medvedev wins the first set, 6-4. His opponent Reilly Opelka is 6‚Äô11‚Äù tall, by the way. He‚Äôs sporting an eye-catching pink outfit with a white cap. He is the joint-tallest player ever on the ATP Tour, tied with Ivo Karlovic. Beat that! Medvedev will serve for the first set against Opelka. He‚Äôd never won a match at Roland Garros before this year. (Thanks Eurosport for the factoid.) Cristian Garin (seeded 22) took his first set against Marcos Giron, 6-1, and now leads 3-2 in the second. Pablo Carre√±o Busta, meanwhile, seeded 12th, fought back to win the first set against Steve Johnson, 6-4. A great moment. Phew, what a wonderful display. Right - what else is going on? The ice-cool Russian, Medvedev, is 4-3 and a break up against Opelka on Court Suzanne Lenglen. Wow - that was just stunning tennis. Davidovich Fokina produces a huge serve, Ruud can only pat it back long, and Davidovich Fokina sinks to the clay, looking simply stunned at having finally got over the line and achieved a fantastic result against the 15th seed. He‚Äôs into the last 16 of a slam for the second time in his career. What a performance! What a match! There is loads of respect between these two young players as they greet each other at the net. A tremendous display from both men. Well played! Davidovich Fokina meets Delbonis in the next round. Davidovich Fokina saves Ruud‚Äôs latest break point with a punishing smash to the body. The crowd are in raptures ... WOW! Davidovich Fokina now jumps into a backhand and smokes it across the court! It‚Äôs another match point after 15 minutes of this game ... and he‚Äôs done it!!!! Ruud gets back in Davidovich Fokina‚Äôs face with two excellent, excellent forehands and gets a break point. Davidovich Fokina tries a cheeky underarm drop serve at break point! Ruud nets the return! Davidovich Fokina sends that fourth match point long. Deuce No 6. This is draining to watch. Davidovich Fokina dumps an easy forehand into the net! Back to deuce again ... and another massive first serve, and a fourth match point for the Malaga man! Here‚Äôs a report from Tumaini Carayol of today‚Äôs action, including Sabalenka‚Äôs exit against Pavlyuchenkova: Back to deuce - Ruud falls over and hits a backhand wide, and it‚Äôs another match point for Davidovich Fokina, his third. Can he seal it? Davidovich Fokina gets a second match point ... and hits a forehand into the net, going for glory! Now a break-back point for Ruud - but Davidovich Fokina cracks an ace down the middle! ‚ÄúYou couldn‚Äôt have scripted it any better,‚Äù insists the Eurosport man on the mic. Commentary bingo! Ruud is under all sorts of pressure but tries a lob ... Davidovich Fokina slips as he attempts to get back to return it! The umpire comes for a look at the mark, and rules that the lob touched the line. Huge drama! The 21-year-old Davidovich Fokina, who hails from Malaga, finds a stunning drop shot for match point! Very, very impressive from the 22-year-old Caspar Ruud, hitting the ball crisply all around the court, moving in behind a big forehand, and earning a break point ... but Davidovich Fokina serves big, and it‚Äôs deuce! In this five-set belter, Ruud is 15-30 on Davidovich Fokina‚Äôs serve now ... But he mishits a forehand, and it‚Äôs 30-30. The young Spaniard is two points away. Second seed Daniil Medvedev has begun his third-round match against Reilly Opelka over on Court Suzanne Lenglen. In addition, Pablo Carreno Busta and Steve Johnson are in the first set, with Johnson 4-3 up right now. Stunning backhand pass from Davidovich Fokina! A fourth break point for the Spaniard ... and he makes it! Ruud sends the ball long and Davidovich Fokina can serve for the match. Cor! Biiiig backhand winner from Davidovich Fokina to bring it back to deuce on Ruud‚Äôs serve. And now Ruud earns a third break point of the game against his better-ranked opponent. So, on Court 14, it‚Äôs a real classic unfolding. Ruud (seeded 15) is serving to save a couple of break points against Davidovich Fokina. He wins a long, punishing rally for 30-40, then produced an ace for deuce! The fans are transfixed by this one. C‚Äôest √ßa. Zverev holds to love, and reaches the fourth round for the fourth year in a row. Djere will be kicking himself, still, about that second set. But it‚Äôs all good experience. It‚Äôs now 5-5 over on Court 7. ‚ÄúVamos!‚Äù yells Davidovich Fokina as he holds serve. Djere manages to hold serve. Yet Zverev will serve for a straight-sets win and a place in the last 16 of the French Open. He is 5-2 up. Ruud leads 5-4 against Davidovich Fokina, with the latter serving to stay in the match. Djere has a game point - but double-faults. His body language is awful, he just doesn‚Äôt want to be out there anymore, knowing it‚Äôs only a matter of time before his misery is ended by Zverev. Zverev and Djere are at deuce. Zverev can smell blood, and takes on a big backhand after a massive forehand return to start with, but it falls just long. Ruud and Davidovich Fokina now locked at 4-4 in the fifth. Zverev eases into a 5-1 third-set lead. He is one game away from the last 16 at Roland Garros. Ruud and Davidovich Fokina are treating the sodden fans to a classic on Court 14: Ruud leads 4-3 in the fifth and final set. Meanwhile, Marcos Giron and the 22nd seed Cristian Garin have just started their third-round match on Court 7. The common or garden Roland Garros super slow-mo celebration replay: This is going to be over fairly quickly, it seems: Zverev has just eased into a 4-1 third-set lead against his demoralised opponent. 6-2, 7-5, 4-1, and Djere (which the commentators are pronouncing ‚ÄòJerry‚Äô) is staring down the barrel. Don‚Äôt forget, you can email or tweet me with your thoughts on the action if you so wish. Email here or tweet @lukemclaughlin Love hold for Zverev. He‚Äôs won eight out of nine games now. Djere holds for 2-1. His loyal band of supporters clap their hands and cheer. Their man is fighting again, having been so annoyed at the way he lost the second set. Zverev is still in control mind you. The narrative seems to have been set, but can Djere again find that level he achieved in the second set, when he was matching - and bettering - the German in the longer exchanges? Zverev has gone 2-0 up in the third set now and has won seven games in a row. The commentator Jo Durie has just mentioned reading our news story about Yana Sizikova‚Äôs arrest in a match-fixing investigation. Here‚Äôs the piece from Tumaini Carayol: The 27th-seeded Italian is dumped out, surprisingly, and the world No 51 Delbonis reaches the last 16 of a slam for the first time. Zverev has a little row with the umpire about a line call. Djere has a break point, and tries to win it with a lob, but it drops long, and Zverev has avoided letting that little disagreement with the umpire put him off. ‚ÄúWord gets round the locker room very quickly if you‚Äôre a quitter,‚Äù observes Jo Durie in the commentary box, suggesting that Djere has to keep motoring here and avoid a complete capitulation, which would cost him in terms of his reputation among his fellow pros. Zverev crunches an ace down the middle as if to reinforce his dominance. He then produces a 135mph serve, his quickest of the match, and unsurprisingly wins that point as well. A clean winner from Djere on Zverev‚Äôs second serve, though, now brings deuce. Djere‚Äôs focus seems to have evaporated after he threw away that second set - or had it wrestled from him by his opponent Zverev. The German breaks to move 1-0 ahead in the third set and it feels very much as if Zverev has a total strangehold on his match. Djere, it emerges on replay, smashed a ball into the stands in pure frustration on losing that last game. Casper Ruud and Alejandro Davidovich Fokina are into a fifth set: Ruud just won the fourth set 6-0. Delbonis is on the verge of beating Fognini in straight sets. ‚ÄúCome on!‚Äù Zverev yells in delight after winning the second set and understandably so - he saved three set points at 5-3 and 40-0 down. Djere came from two sets down to defeat Miomir Kecmanoviƒá a couple of days ago, but it is very hard to see him pulling off the same here. Zverev moves 6-5 up with another break of serve and Djere is visibly disgusted with himself, after having three set points a few moments ago. Zverev to serve for a two-set lead. Laaksonen has packed it in against Nishikori. The German holds for 5-5, despite a double fault during that game. Here‚Äôs a big test for Djere, who could do with a nice easy hold to calm his nerves. But he‚Äôs not getting many free points from Zverev right now. Zverev breaks to make it 4-5! That‚Äôs some serious fight from Zverev, who was a point away from ceding the first set. Djere crashes a ball into the clay in frustration - he should be home and dry in this second set, but now he‚Äôs in a dogfight. Great hustle from Zverev as he fights back from 40-0 down to deuce, with Djere on the verge of sealing the set ... and now he wins a break point! Delbonis has gone 3-0 up in the third against the racquet-puncher Fognini. Nishikori, meanwhile, has won the first set against Laaksonen, 7-5. The umpire calls for new balls after Zverev holds serves to make it 5-3. Zverev has drifted out of this match somewhat, and Djere will now serve for the second set. Djere, the 26-year-old Serbian, holds to lead 5-2. Break for Djere! He seals it by winning the best rally of the match! It‚Äôs 4-2 and we‚Äôve got ourselves a game on. Djere mixed it up nicely in that long rally, holding back with a sliced backhand here and there, and showing impressive patience before stretching Zverev sufficiently to force the error from his opponent. Zverev nets a backhand, while on the run, and Djere is well in control of this second set at the moment. Djere moves to 0-30 on the Zverev serve, partly thanks to a double fault. He takes on a big down-the-line winner to try and earn three break points but again, it‚Äôs just outside the tramline, and perhaps he didn‚Äôt need to take that on. Anyway, he does eventually earn a break point, at 30-40 ... In terms of power, Zverev has looked a little less dominant in the last few minutes, but suddenly he fires back with a fizzing double-handed backhand that is simply too hot for Djere to handle. Zverev goes on to earn two break points at 15-40 ... and he wins the first one as Djere sends a forehand an inch or two wide. Zverev breaks back, and it‚Äôs 3-2 in the second set. Djere tries an astonishing cross-court pass on the first point of Zverev‚Äôs service game, but it drops fractionally wide. However, it‚Äôs another sign that the Serbian is feeling confident and ready to take shots on, where previously he looked tentative and nervy. Zverev holds, and it‚Äôs 3-1 in the second. Djere, all of a sudden, clearly believes he can match Zverev in the longer rallies. He gets the better of the German in a long exchange at deuce on his own serve, smashing a volleyed winner to the corner, and then converting his advantage to lead 3-0 in the second set. He has a small band of vocal fans who are on their feet and singing as their man begins to grow into this match more and more. Rain-soaked fans are currently cheering on the Roland Garros ground staff as they try to clear water from the uncovered courts: Three break points for Djere! He converts the first thanks to an unforced error by Zverev, who sends a forehand wide, and Djere leads this second set 2-0. That game was a scrappy affair from the German and Djere is back in this. Beautiful play from Zverev, getting right over the top of Djere‚Äôs second serve, and returning it with punishing force and accuracy to his opponent‚Äôs forehand side. Djere manages to stay in the point for a few shots, but it‚Äôs only a matter of time, and Zverev clips an efficient volley to the corner which Djere can‚Äôt reach. All that said - Djere holds serves after all, and leads the second set 1-0. Zverev has won 73% of points on his first serve, and 83% on his second. Zverev holds to love, with no momentum shift in sight for Djere. He takes the first set 6-2. Here is Fognini punching his racquet a little earlier: Fognini, apparently, punched the strings of his racquet and needed a medical timeout, with claret everywhere, in his ongoing match against Delbonis. Now, Zverev is serving for the set. Boom! Djere pounces on a rare short ball from his opponent and crushes a forehand winner to the corner. It‚Äôs 5-2. Far too early to suggest that‚Äôs a momentum-shifter of a shot, but it will feed the Serbian‚Äôs confidence a little. Deuce on Djere‚Äôs serve. Zverev engineers a delicate drop shot from the baseline, and Djere can‚Äôt get there fast enough to dig it out. Break and set point. Zverev goes for glory with a brave forehand down the line, but it‚Äôs just wide, and back to deuce. Zverev goes 5-1 up. Djere capitulated in that game to a certain extent with a couple of sloppy errors. He immediately finds a very good winner to begin his service game, however. With his flowing locks of fair hair, bandana and copious gold jewellery (including a medallion), there is a distinctly 1970s vibe to Zverev‚Äôs look. Nothing wrong with that, either. Meanwhile, Djere gathers himself to hold serve to love, which is a foothold in the match, and it‚Äôs 4-1. Zverev closes out another comfortable hold with a cleanly-hit ace. It‚Äôs 4-0. Zverev breaks again! He‚Äôs 3-0 up and playing some accomplished stuff against Djere, the Hungarian who is ranked 55. Meanwhile, Delbonis is two sets to the good against Fognini: 6-4, 6-1, while Nishikori leads Laaksonen 6-5 in the first on Court Simonne Mathieu. Rain stops play on the other courts as it hammers down on the recently closed roof of Philippe-Chatrier. Concerning news: Russian tennis player Yana Sizikova has been arrested in Paris by French police as part of a match fixing investigation. Here is Tumaini Carayol‚Äôs story: Zverev forces deuce on Djere‚Äôs serve, crafting a rally beautifully from the back of the court, varying the pace and direction of his shots, before ending it with a cross-court forehand pass that loops away from Djere - who can only shake his head and wonder how he is going to live with this quality of hitting from the other side of the net ... Zverev moves 2-0 up by holding his first service game. Then there‚Äôs a lovely forehand winner, angled down the line, as a reminder to Djere that merely holding serve isn‚Äôt going to be entirely straightforward against a player of Zverev‚Äôs calibre. Thanks David. All happening: Zverev breaks Djere at the first time of asking. Meanwhile, the retractable roof above Philippe-Chatrier is being closed to keep the rain out, which has obviously now rolled over Paris, having been soaking the south of England for most of the morning. These players are famously tough, though, and are carrying on regardless as the roof closes above them with not a towel in sight. I‚Äôll hand you back to Luke McLaughlin to bring hot news of the lengthy first game in the Zverev-Djere clash. Big applause now on Philippe-Chatrier as Alexander Zverev, the sixth seed, starts out against Serbia‚Äôs Laslo Djere. It‚Äôs their first meeting at Roland Garros. Zverev was a quarter-finalist here in both 2018 and 2019 while going out in the fourth round last year. The German made the final of the 2020 US Open but lost a five-set thriller to Dominic Thiem after being two sets up. Nishikori has three break points in the fifth game but can‚Äôt take any of them. Laaksonen survives that but Nishikori holds serve and then breaks to love in the seventh to go 4-3 ahead. A couple of stats to tell the story of the Azarenka v Keys game. Keys hit nearly three times as many winners (17 to Azarenka‚Äôs 6) but made a whopping 33 unforced errors in the 16 games they played. Azarenka‚Äôs count was 12. Out to Court Simonne-Mathieu now where Japan‚Äôs Kei Nishikori is doing battle with Switzerland‚Äôs Henri Laaksonen. It‚Äôs early days, with former US Open finalist Nishikori holding in the fourth game to make it 2-2 in the first set. Out on Court 14, Norway‚Äôs Casper Ruud continues to have his problems against Alejandro Davidovich Fokina. The Spaniard won the first set on a tie-break before 15th seed Ruud hit back to take the second 6-2. But Davidovic Fokina is now 3-0 up in the third. All over! Azarenka mistakenly thinks she‚Äôs served an ace at 30-30 but it‚Äôs called out. The second serve is long and the double fault gives Keys a break point but she hits a poor groundstroke halfway up the net, audibly giving herself a ticking off. Azarenka misses a first match point by going wide with a forehand and Keys hits a superb winner to save a second. But it‚Äôs third time lucky as another Keys error and an accurate serve down the middle from Azarenka seals a comfortable and deserved 6-2 6-2 victory. Azarenka, aided by a little luck at 30-15, holds serve to go 5-2 up. No margin for error now from Keys. Over on Court Suzanne-Lenglen, Federico Delbonis leads Fabio Fognini, the 27th seed, 5-4 in the opener and will be serving to win the set. Azarenka doesn‚Äôt wilt and survives some heavy Keys groundstrokes to reel off the next three points and take it to 30. The 15th seed leads 4-2 and is now just two games away from victory. Keys holds to reduce the deficit to 3-2 and now she‚Äôs 30-15 up on the Azarenka serve in the next. A change in momentum here perhaps. Keys gets a game back by winning the fourth but is still a break down at 1-3 in the second set against Azarenka. Thanks Luke. I‚Äôll try and be the no-frills doubles partner that hogs the net and blocks a few back. Azarenka goes 3-0 up in the second, having won eight games in a row. Keys is not at the races. In the men‚Äôs singles, meanwhile: Alejandro Davidovich Fokina won his first set against Casper Ruud on a tie-breaker, but Ruud has just gone 4-1 up in the second set. And Federico Delbonis is 3-1 up on Fabio Fognini in their first set. Now, it‚Äôs time for me to hand over to David Tindall, and I‚Äôll be back soon for the afternoon‚Äôs action ... Over on Philippe-Chatrier, Azarenka has broken Keys in the second and leads 2-0 after winning the first set 6-2. On Court 7, Zidansek and Siniakova are into a third and final set. Siniakova dominated the first set, 6-0, before Zidansek took the second set on a tie-breaker. All over. Pavlyuchenkova reaches the last 16 for the second time in her career - the last time she did so was 10 years ago. Sabalenka, in the second set, started to hit the ball in fearsome style and took it comfortably, 6-2. Pavlyuchenkova took a medical timeout - I am not sure what the problem was - and all the momentum that the world No 4 had built up seemed to disappear. However, Pavlyuchenkova played an excellent match, was far more consistent than her opponent, who produced a litany of unforced errors and is knocked out. At least Sabalenka will be able to say she took her shots on, and went down all guns blazing, even if blazing in accurately for the most part. Sabalenka edges to 30-30 with Pavlyuchenkova serving for the match. Can she strike back and find something in this third set? Azarenka wins the first set against Keys, 6-2. Break point for Pavlyuchenkova - and Sabalenka loses her composure again and crashes a big forehand very wide. It‚Äôs 5-0 in the deciding set, and surely, it‚Äôs all over. Now 4-0, as Pavlyuchenkova holds, and moves a step closer to the last 16. Sabalenka double-faults to kick off this service game, which she has to win to retain a slender chance of recovery. Deep trouble for Sabalenka, who now falls 3-0 behind in the third and final set. The precision of Pavlyuchenkova has been eye-catching in these past three games. Can Sabalenka, the world No 4, harness her power effectively once again as she did in that second set? Super stuff from Pavlyuchenkova, working her opponent around the court and fashioning the chance for a winner, and she has a chance to move 2-0 up in this decisive set ... which she does! Much as in the first set, frustration is creeping in for Sabalenka. Sabalenka makes it to 0-30 on her opponents serve, then nets a shot, much to her frustration. A brilliant volley from Pavlyuchenkova, on her toes, makes it 30-30 and now Sabalenka forces a break point. Azarenka has broken Keys, and leads 4-2 in the first. Pavlyuchenkova breaks! You have to wonder what the medical issue was. A cynic may suggest she simply took a few minutes out to try and stop Sabalenka‚Äôs momentum, which was looking unstoppable. Pavlyuchenkova is now back on court for the third set against Sabalenka. The No 3 seed is serving first in this deciding set. She double-faults twice to hand her opponent two break points. As suspected, that break for the medical timeout hasn‚Äôt done Sabalenka any good. Azarenka holds for 2-2 in the first set against Keys. Both have started the match well, both striking the ball sweetly, and looking pretty evenly matched in the rallies. Pavlyuchenkova has just walked off court for a medical timeout. If nothing else, that will interrupt Sabalenka‚Äôs rhythm: she was seeing it like a football in that second set, which she won 6-2. It‚Äôs with serve in the Azarenka v Keys match, at 2-1 to Keys, although it‚Äôs 30-30 on Azarenka‚Äôs serve now. In the battle of the Elenas, Rybakina has knocked out Vesnina, 6-1, 6-4. Sabalenka takes the second set, 6-2. Pavlyuchenkova simply couldn‚Äôt live with her opponent‚Äôs power and precision during that set. Sabalenka lacked precision in the first set, but has certainly found her range now, and there is going to be plenty of work to do for Pavlyuchenkova now. This is great to watch from Sabalenka, unless you are Pavlyuchenkova‚Äôs coach. Seemingly effortlessly she goes to 0-30 with a pass and a cleanly returned winner. And now to 0-40, three set points. The quality of Sabalenka‚Äôs hitting is looking more and more ominous for Pavlyuchenkova now. Sabalenka holds for 5-2, peppering her opponent with powerful groundstrokes, including one superb clean winner on her forehand side. Picturesque. An astonishingly good double-handed backhand return, which almost kisses the line right in the corner, creates two break points for Sabalenka. Pavlyuchenkova did not have a hope of getting close to that one. Sabalenka converts the first break point, and leads 4-2. She doesn‚Äôt over-celebrate, either, but looks quietly satisfied that her power hitting is starting to tell on the scoreboard. A comfortable Sabalenka hold for 3-2 in the second set. Meanwhile, Victoria Azarenka (15) and Madison Keys (23) are about to begin their third-round match on Court Philippe-Chatrier. Pavlyuchenkova, who is certainly looking the more consistent player, holds for 2-2. Sabalenka‚Äôs power is unstoppable when she gets it right, and she it not hesitating to attack, but she is also making too many errors in comparison with her opponent at the moment. Sabalenka puts away a forehand volley efficiently and holds comfortably for 2-1. Sabalenka has started this second set with renewed focus and is hitting the ball with serious authority compared to the second half of that first set. She goes on the attack to try and save a game point at 40-30, but sends a forehand wide, and it‚Äôs 1-1. Sabalenka holds serve impressively to open the second set, winning the first point with a cute drop-shot, and the second with another booming groundstroke to the baseline. Rybakina and Vesnina are now 2-2 in the second set, after Rybakina took the first 6-1. Over on Court 7, Katerina Siniakova took her first set against Tamara Zidansek 6-0, but Zidansek now leads 3-2 in the second. Pavlyuchenkova moves in behind a first serve and volleys decisively to take the first set, 6-4. It was very much a set of two halves, with Sabalenka sprinting out of the blocks and into a 3-0 lead. But a catalogue of errors by the Belarusian handed the initiative to Pavlyuchenkova, who won five straight games and sealed the set comfortably in the end. Unforced errors all over the place from Sabalenka. She dumps the first return of the game into the net, then sends a backhand long to gift Pavlyuchenkova a 30-0 advantage. Sabalenka holds, sealing the game with a big serve that was called out by a line judge. The umps leaves his seat to take a look at the mark, and rules it good. However, the Russian Pavlyuchenkova will now serve for the first set, at 5-4. A smart serve-volley from Pavlyuchenkova sees her save the break point, and she then takes the game for 5-3 in the first set. Sabalenka is clearly a bit frustrated with her game, and is occasionally venting her anger by winding up a huge forehand, or an unreasonably powerful second serve. Pavlyuchenkova attempts a delicate drop-volley which would put her 40-0 up on her serve, but places it fractionally wide. Sabalenka forces it to 30-30, and then absolutely destroys a brilliantly powerful forehand down the line for a break point. Much more like it from the Russian. Tennis - bloody hell! Pavlyuchenkova has now won four straight games and leads 4-3 in the first set. This one could get interesting. It‚Äôs 3-3 and all square in the first set between Pavlyuchenkova and Sabalenka. Sabalenka finds a couple of break points now, but the 29-year-old Pavlyuchenkova does well to bring it back to deuce in this sixth game of the first set. Our Eurosport commentator informs us that this is the 14th time Pavlyuchenkova has played at Roland Garros, which is quite a record. Sabalenka now saves a game point with a few massive groundstrokes that wear Pavlyuchenkova down with sheer force ... however, the Russian eventually finds a way. And now Pavlyuchenkova finds a break of her oppenents serve, and is right back in this first set at 3-2. Pavlyuchenkova is now on the board: it‚Äôs 3-1 in Sabalenka‚Äôs favour. Elsewhere, Elena Rybakina (21) now leads Elena Vesnina 5-0 in their first set. On Court Simonne Mathieu, Aryna Sabalenka (3) has raced into a 3-0 first-set lead against Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova (31). Sabalenka is the top-seeded player left in the women‚Äôs competition, following the withdrawals of Ash Barty and Naomi Osaka. The debate on Naomi Osaka‚Äôs withdrawal from this tournament rumbles on. Watch a video explainer, featuring the thoughts of our tennis reporter Tumaini Carayol, right here: Yesterday we saw Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Iga Swiatek, among others, progress safely to the third round at Roland Garros, while the women‚Äôs world No 1, Ash Barty, was forced to retire from her match against Magda Linette with a hip injury. There was also a notable flare-up over slow play between Federer and his opponent Marin Cilic. There was no shortage of action and drama on Thursday, so what will Friday bring? In the women‚Äôs singles, Victoria Azarenka faces Madison Keys from 11am, and Serena Williams will be on court at 3pm for a third-round match against compatriot Daniel Rose-Collins. In the men‚Äôs singles, Alexander Zverev is due on court at 11.15am to meet Laslo Dere of Hungary, and two hours after that, Daniil Medvedev will face off against the American Reilly Opelka. Those are just a few of the matches on today‚Äôs menu, which will no doubt be full of skill, intensity, super slow-motion replays, and frequent use of the towel.

They‚Äôre always such great competition, and I always get a text from my mum at the start of each game that says: ‚ÄòIsn‚Äôt Kane Williamson lovely? A proper sportsman.‚Äô That‚Äôs real value, there.‚Äù</p> \n  <p>Okay, deep breath. Are we ready for my World Test Championship re-jig? Are you going to be kind in your emails when you disagree?</p> \n  <p>Two groups of six, for starters. It has to include all Test nations. And let‚Äôs accept that we‚Äôll find an elegant way to sort those groups out every two years - seedings from the previous cycle will do it. </p> \n  <p>What about the points? Here‚Äôs the controversial bit. For mine, <em>only</em> three-Test series to count in the WTC; no more two-Test business. All series (and matches) to therefore be worth the same. </p> \n  <p>Issue one: whaddabout the Ashes and other four/five Test series? In this model, <em>only the first three</em> would count in the WTC. My belief is that the Ashes/Border-Gavaskar is important enough that the final two Tests wouldn‚Äôt mean any less because the WTC bit is finished.</p> \n  <p>Issue two: the cost of putting on Tests - a big issue for many of the non-Big Three nations. A compromise. If they agree to play series of three instead of two, they can play those contests over four days.</p> \n  <p>Now, I dislike four-day Test cricket; I don‚Äôt want that to become the norm. But if this is the trade-off to get New Zealand playing Pakistan thrice at home, to set the global standard at three instead of two, then I think it is a worthy price to pay. Especially when those four-day affairs have been, so far, over 98-overs per day, rather than 90.</p> \n  <p>From there, the top team from each group makes the WTC Final. Alternatively, the top two, with a new round-robin to begin to determine the two teams to play in the Grand Final.

While it has also been suggested that the colours were borrowed from the wandering club I Zingari who were founded in 1845 and shared many members with the MCC. </p> \n  <p>However, common consensus leans to the Club taking on its colours as a personal thank you to William Nicholson who assisted in purchasing the freehold of Lord‚Äôs Ground.

If reviews are already exhausted then it‚Äôs simply a no-ball. Sorted.‚Äù Or just a bit of a re-jig to Law 42. Shouldn‚Äôt be too difficult. Oh, there is some live international cricket on right now, I‚Äôm told! Would it surprise you to learn that my entire inbox contains historical figures and where they might bat or bowl? Let‚Äôs do a handful more and I might move it on a bit after that. ‚ÄúIn their own very different ways,‚Äù writes Ewan Glenton, ‚Äúsurely Jack the Ripper, Lord Lucan and mathematician David Hilbert have all played themselves into contention as wicketkeeper over the years, having stumped so many people.‚Äù Very good. ‚ÄúI would absolutely insist on finding a space in the team for Sigmund Freud,‚Äù suggests Dawn Morgan. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôd be a natural at slip.‚Äù ‚ÄúSurely Machiavelli as captain?‚Äù Kerrith Britland reckons. ‚ÄúAnd, of course, Caravaggio for some violent chin music.‚Äù Peter Salmon wants Jacques Derrida. And he sends me a photo of the French philosopher playing the game as well - nice. Peter Metcalfe, with his umpire‚Äôs hat on. ‚ÄúPope Gregory the First. With papal infallibility, there would be no need for any reviews.‚Äù Last but not least, the great Gary Naylor. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm surprised that the rather militaristic XI did not find room for Barnes Wallis, whose bouncers were more destructive than Harold Larwood‚Äôs.‚Äù The short-history of hat-tricks. A note from from pal at Wisden Cricket Monthly Towers, Jim Wallace, who wrote the below piece. He‚Äôs writing to us from Lord‚Äôs. ‚ÄúIt looks wet. To get my Blackadder on - Wetter than Wet Wet Wet performing a cover of ‚Äòwaterfalls‚Äô on a wet weekend in Wetwang. For my money, Naseem Shah‚Äôs hat-trick is up there as one of the best, his age alone putting him in the conversation. Irfan Pathan‚Äôs first over effort and Mathew Hoggard‚Äôs Barbados blitzkrieg are also firm favorites.‚Äù This is, what we would call in my politics days, a killer fact. Ian Ward confirms that a) it‚Äôs still raining and b) they need to be on by 6pm to get any play in today. They won‚Äôt need long to clean it up, that much I do know from having commentated all the county games at Lord‚Äôs this season. Half an hour of dry weather is enough. ‚ÄúSurely Sir Francis Bacon, Sir Water Raleigh, Victor Hugo should be in the team as they were all bowlers!‚Äù insists NC Benson. ‚ÄúAnd if you want variations surely Edward Elgar can‚Äôt be overlooked!‚Äù Wills Doug is here too: ‚ÄúThatcher‚Äôs a run out waiting to happen. (This lady‚Äôs not for turning).‚Äù And Tom Morgan has a few candidates. ‚ÄúGraham Greene fielding at third man? A Beatles tribute band in the covers? As captain, the great general Hannibal. If he could get elephants over the Alps, he could get a few more fiery old-ball overs out of a tired fast bowler. ‚ÄúAfternoon Adam.‚Äù Allo, Elliot Brooks. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure this has been litigated enough already, but surely just two tests isn‚Äôt enough for a New Zealand series? They‚Äôre always such great competition, and I always get a text from my mum at the start of each game that says: ‚ÄòIsn‚Äôt Kane Williamson lovely? A proper sportsman.‚Äô That‚Äôs real value, there.‚Äù Okay, deep breath. Are we ready for my World Test Championship re-jig? Are you going to be kind in your emails when you disagree? Two groups of six, for starters. It has to include all Test nations. And let‚Äôs accept that we‚Äôll find an elegant way to sort those groups out every two years - seedings from the previous cycle will do it. What about the points? Here‚Äôs the controversial bit. For mine, only three-Test series to count in the WTC; no more two-Test business. All series (and matches) to therefore be worth the same. Issue one: whaddabout the Ashes and other four/five Test series? In this model, only the first three would count in the WTC. My belief is that the Ashes/Border-Gavaskar is important enough that the final two Tests wouldn‚Äôt mean any less because the WTC bit is finished. Issue two: the cost of putting on Tests - a big issue for many of the non-Big Three nations. A compromise. If they agree to play series of three instead of two, they can play those contests over four days. Now, I dislike four-day Test cricket; I don‚Äôt want that to become the norm. But if this is the trade-off to get New Zealand playing Pakistan thrice at home, to set the global standard at three instead of two, then I think it is a worthy price to pay. Especially when those four-day affairs have been, so far, over 98-overs per day, rather than 90. From there, the top team from each group makes the WTC Final. Alternatively, the top two, with a new round-robin to begin to determine the two teams to play in the Grand Final. Et voila! ‚ÄúAdam.‚Äù Andrew Benton. ‚ÄúAnd there I was, thinking a Celebrappeal was appealing in the style of a celebrity. That‚Äôd be much more fun, and an almost limitless supply of celebs to emulate / mock!‚Äù It‚Äôs been great fun but it‚Äôs now a big part of the county game which, in turn, means it‚Äôll start to infect recreational cricket. No thanks. Henry J. Heinz is Charles Sheldrick‚Äôs spinner in our Historical XI. ‚ÄúFor his numerous variations.‚Äù ‚ÄúGood afternoon Adam.‚Äù Hello, Sam Charlton. ‚ÄúWhilst not much of a problem at present at Lords, the glorious weather creates a unique issue I want to bring to your attention: face mask tan lines. An unfortunate soul whom I go out to events with as a nurse found this out the hard way. Obviously it is hilarious for everyone else, but not if you‚Äôre the victim.‚Äù Only the hard-hitting issues during a rainy OBO! But it‚Äôs a good point. I once overdid it at the Aussie Open with sunglasses on with the burn line causing me all sorts of grief for about, oh, six months. Another time, falling asleep at the MCG with my shirt off (this day), nearly landed me in hospital. I deserved for it to land me in hospital. The Historical Figures XI is popular. Stephen Holden wants Jesus Christ to feature in the middle order. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a big hitter. Apparently he cleared the temple.‚Äù Very good. Michael Robinson has Charlemagne in the mix. ‚ÄúAnd just in behind Caesar would be a nice place for Brutus.‚Äù A full XI from Mark Dawson? Alright, go on then: Stonewall Jackson, La Pasionara, General Patton, Prince Rupert Erwin, Rommel (C, also handy as a fourth seamer), Marshal Ney, Florence Nightingale (keeper), Quintus Fabius, Oliver Cromwell, Marshall Zhukov Saladi. Very... militaristic. Hello, everyone. Like Daniel, I‚Äôm also about five miles from Lord‚Äôs and my assessment of the situation is much the same as his. But we‚Äôll make our own fun in the usual way, won‚Äôt we? I‚Äôve spent my morning writing about trying to stamp out Celebrappeals, because I‚Äôm a really cool guy like that. Coming from a place of love, of course - Broad fandom, one must be part of it. But still. That wasn‚Äôt good yesterday, from the England champion, nor Tim Southee later on. Sorry to start negatively. Must be the rain. Here‚Äôs Nassem Shah‚Äôs hat-trick (featuring a Celebrappeal, wicket two) - what joyous cricket. Right, that‚Äôs me done for the day. Here‚Äôs Adam Collins to ease you through the rest of the day, which will hopefully feature some klikkit ‚Äì email him on adam.collins.casual@theguardian.com. ‚ÄúI have managed to create a holy trinity of Steve Davis, Boiler Room and OBO,‚Äù says Patrick Duce. ‚ÄúWho‚Äôd have thought it? A one hour DJ set should get us through to the end of play?‚Äù DJ Steve Davis is a bit techno for my taste ‚Äì what a succession of words that is ‚Äì but any port in a storm. ‚ÄúGreetings from sunny Lago Como,‚Äù brags Tom Morgan. ‚ÄúAlastair Campbell ‚Äì spin option, Mrs Tiggywinkle ‚Äì seam-stress, Coco Chanel ‚Äì number 5.‚Äù Laugh! ‚ÄúXI of historical figures,‚Äù emails Alistair Leadbetter. ‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs room in there for Gandhi, Einstein, Aristotle, and the fearsome duo of Martin Luther and Martin Luther King. This reminds me of when I used to play Owzat and had plenty of non-cricketing teams such as Rock Stars, Artists, Philosophers, Sunderland players, etc. I say ‚Äòused to‚Äô, but who am I kidding...? It helps pass a rainy day.‚Äù Somewhere at my parents‚Äô house is an original set, and I can‚Äôt contest those suggestions, especially not the spin-twins of Einstein and Aristotle. ‚ÄúDo you think the Black Caps were deliberately bowling on Burns‚Äô leg stump,‚Äù asks Ruth Purdue, ‚Äúor did they have their radar off? As he gets most of his runs on the leg side, it seemed curious.‚Äù I‚Äôd guess the latter ‚Äì lefties get a load of deliveries in that area, and getting used or re-used to the slope probably exacerbates that. It‚Äôs still raining just under five miles from Lord‚Äôs, so I imagine it‚Äôs still doing likewise at Lord‚Äôs. I‚Äôm still hopeful we‚Äôll get some play, but the forecast is not especially inspiring, and a total washout is undeniably on the agenda. If we were compiling an XI of historical figures, who would be in it? Feel free to fill in the gaps, or drop those I‚Äôve picked. 1. Steve Davis 2. Alexander the Great 3. Julius Caesar 4. 5. Napoleon 6. God 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. Boudica (RF) Back to our earlier chat about pitches, another flat-track advantage is work for the spinners: on a 220 all-out green top, they‚Äôre not going to do much, but on a batting wicket they‚Äôll be as crucial as the first hour. I can see no flaw in this rationale whatsoever. If it‚Äôs any consolation, is also raining in Paris ‚Äì but they‚Äôve got a roof. Here we go, the ubiquitous prawns in Marie Rose their own separate course. Nothing to do with cricket, and yet everything to do with everything. We‚Äôve got plenty play in the Champo, and Tanya Aldred has the latest ‚Äì check it out. ‚ÄúEnjoying the non cricket convo!‚Äù emails Mark Slater. ‚ÄúBecause I was otherwise occupied I am a bit late to the OBO, but I would like to voice my appreciation at the sharing of the Mysterons, the finest Hale and Pace appreciation turn ever!‚Äù There aren‚Äôt many albums that so evoke a time, and I‚Äôm pleased to report that it‚Äôs aged beautifully ‚Äì I played it to my seven-year-old recently, and was greeted with none of the usual disparagement. Just rereading the MCC colour explanation, is this the only context in which we talk of ‚Äúegg and bacon‚Äù rather than ‚Äúbacon and egg‚Äù? And is there a linguistic reason we describe paurs of objects in particular order, so never say ‚Äúchips and fish,‚Äù ‚Äúfork and knife‚Äù or ‚Äúblame and bang‚Äù? I‚Äôm afraid to say. I guess we‚Äôre 90 minutes away from play, minimum. Hello again. ‚ÄúHow was it that the MCC chose the Catalan colours for their branding, way back in the mists of time?‚Äù wonders Andrew Benton. ‚ÄúEven the MCC logo looks like it‚Äôs a big C! Was there a tour to Barcelona in the 18xx‚Äôs that inspired them .... or did the Catalans like cricket and copy the MCC?‚Äù The Lord‚Äôs website teaches as follows, but it doesn‚Äôt claim to be definitive: ‚ÄúThe original MCC colour of sky blue was replaced in Victorian times by the famous red and yellow. They are now recognised the world over (affectionately referred to as ‚Äòegg and bacon‚Äô). MCC Museum houses a boundary flag dating from this period, which is the earliest known example of the red and yellow monogram, but it remains a mystery on why these colours were chosen ‚Äì though a number of explanations have been proposed. The colours are similar to those used as racing colours by The Duke of Richmond who had strong ties with the Club in the early days of MCC. While it has also been suggested that the colours were borrowed from the wandering club I Zingari who were founded in 1845 and shared many members with the MCC. However, common consensus leans to the Club taking on its colours as a personal thank you to William Nicholson who assisted in purchasing the freehold of Lord‚Äôs Ground. Nicholson, an MCC Member, was also the owner of the Nicholson‚Äôs Gin Company, the colours of which were red and yellow ‚Äì in what was perhaps an early example of corporate sponsorship.‚Äù Right, I guess that‚Äôs lunch. I‚Äôm off to marinate some lamb ‚Äì see you in about 40, hopefully for some cricket. There they are, the lads. Goodness me. Sky are showing a doc about England‚Äôs hilarious trip to India in 1992-93; for the first Test, England picked four seamers and one spinner, while India picked one seamer and three spinners. Who to believe? ‚ÄúI‚Äôve expressed myself (and Tom) a little clumsily there,‚Äù returns Mike Daniels, ‚Äúbut the point he was making was that if you only play on flat wickets you won‚Äôt necessarily promote the mindset and techniques of taking wickets, you will, in the main, promote defensive bowling. You‚Äôre right that you need to take wickets to win a Test but you won‚Äôt necessarily develop the bowlers to think about taking wickets if you don‚Äôt put them into situations where the pressure is on them to take wickets, and there‚Äôs no better place to do that than in a situation where they are expected to, as opposed to hoping to. The bowler then has to develop the relevant techniques to do so in varied conditions.‚Äù I see both sides, I really do, but it‚Äôs also the case that England have struggled to take 20 wickets in India and Australia and I‚Äôd guess that more practise on flat tracks is likely to be helpful. On which point, I absolutely loved this ‚Äì sentiment and turn of phrase. Please excuse my namedrop, but KP told me the same, and that if you were out or fielding, you waded in to the fullest possible extent. He also reserved particular praise the the prawns in Marie Rose sauce. Weather update: it‚Äôs still raining, so lunch will be taken as usual at 1pm meaning no play until 1.40pm at the earliest but realistically, it‚Äôll probably be later than that. ‚ÄúAt the risk of being ‚Äòthat guy‚Äô,‚Äù says Nick Ridgman, ‚ÄúI must insist that Detectorists is referred to by its proper name, sans rogue ‚ÄòThe‚Äô.‚Äù Behold my ‚ÄúNetherlands‚Äù below! ‚ÄúStill trying to work out if Silverwood would have preferred a flat pitch or a lively one as a player,‚Äù muses Sean Clayton. ‚ÄúIf we believe Wikipedia, Bob Cottam claimed Silverwood was faster than Allan Donald (!) but I remember him as more of a swing and seam bowler than an outright paceman...‚Äù I‚Äôm certain he‚Äôd have fancied a greentop ‚Äì and no, I‚Äôm not sure he was quite as quick as Ai Dee. ‚ÄúStealing a break to glance at the OBO in the rehearsal room (Le Wine Club with Anna Lou, opens Brighton Fringe June 19th since you ask),‚Äù begins Michael Keane. ‚ÄúShame about the weather but wondering if you have any updates on the ODI in Utrecht? Don‚Äôt know which site is best for scores so thought I‚Äôd email you. And much as I love Ireland, having the live stream on here while directing would probably be unprofessional...‚Äù Netherlands are 123-8 off 40, so Ireland are pretty well-placed. Good luck with the play! ‚ÄúFlatter pitches,‚Äù begins Mike Daniels. ‚ÄúTom Cartwright would say that producing flatter pitches doesn‚Äôt produce better bowlers except in the sense that they become better defensive bowlers. He ascribed to the view that pitches with something in them made for better bowlers as it put the pressure on the bowlers to deliver wickets and develop an attacking mindset rather than a defensive one. The good bowlers will find a way to take wickets on most surfaces if that‚Äôs the way that they set out to achieve.‚Äù That‚Äôs a really interesting angle ‚Äì so much of sport, and life, is played in the mind. I‚Äôm not sure I can buy it though, because you can‚Äôt win a Test bowling defensively on a flat track ‚Äì you need to find a way to attack even with no help from the conditions. And another of looking at things might be that the good bowlers look to attack on every wicket. ‚ÄúOn the subject of spreading joy,‚Äù emails Brian Withington, ‚Äúall three seasons of the Detectorists are a delight but the last episode is simply wonderful. See also Marvellous, also with the impeccably life-affirming Toby Jones lead role. You‚Äôre welcome.‚Äù Someone pressed the Detectorists on me quite some time ago, and I sort of mentally filed it under whimsy. But if it‚Äôs worth a go, will have a look ‚Äì and agree on Marvellous. Ian Ward reckons rain until about 2pm, then we should get a decent amount of cricket thereafter. ‚ÄúFrom his mouth to God‚Äôs ears,‚Äù as my Gran would‚Äôve said. ‚ÄúG‚Äôday Daniel,‚Äù says Alistair Connor. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm thinking ‚ÄòHa. England. Summer. Rain.‚Äô But to be honest, you‚Äôve got just as much of a chance of rain interruption in Auckland in December. Except that the rain is warmer. And it doesn‚Äôt last all bloody day.‚Äù What‚Äôs especially galling here is that in most of the country, they‚Äôre playing ‚Äì even Old Trafford, for crying out loud. But hopefully we‚Äôll get enough in today to make the next two days what they should be. In other what were you doing at 16 affirmation: I‚Äôm sure that when he‚Äôs not in the middle, he‚Äôs memorising every lyric and noise of Dummy. Oh, and one more: Musa Okwonga‚Äôs book, One of Them, achieves the difficult feat of being an easy read ‚Äì it‚Äôs propulsive and entertaining ‚Äì and a difficult read ‚Äì it teaches you things about the world and about yourself that are upsetting. Find out more: Longtime members of our community will know that the OBO is not just for cricket but for the general sharing of joy, so allow me to recommend a couple of things that have enriched my recent life: Les Mis√©rables ‚Äì not the original, but the Ladj Li film on Netflix ‚Äì is really, really worth your heart and mind. And, on an entirely different tip, American Barbecue Showdown has perhaps the most likeable cast of any reality show I‚Äôve seen. Yeah, it‚Äôs still raining. No one has sent me any cake to stimulate conversation but we can pretend to the contrary; I‚Äôd love a school dinner-style treacle sponge. It‚Äôs interesting that Chris Silverwood has asked for flatter pitches this summer, so his bowlers get better at finding a way and his batsmen get better at occupying the crease. I guess we can add it to the IPL on our list of things about which KP was right, but otherwise that strikes me as good news for Jofra Archer and Mark Wood, whose pace becomes even more valuable. I also can‚Äôt wait to see how Branderson impose themselves just when we think that conditions are against them. Pivoting back to the match, Rory Burns will be delighted to have got a score here. I guess there‚Äôs a feeling that England‚Äôs top three aren‚Äôt quite cemented yet, Burns and Sibley good players who‚Äôve not yet made the runs to waive stylistic concerns and Crawley seeking to bring his bottom level closer to his very acceptable top level. I hope all three do well this summer, but I‚Äôd absolutely love another look at Hasseb Hameed, and not just because of his luscious locks. ‚ÄúSince we‚Äôre on a hip-hop tip,‚Äù says George Browne, ‚ÄúDo you think today‚Äôs cloud will see the ball hooping around?‚Äù In the first hour, for sure, but at 60 minutes and one second? Who can say. The umpires are in the middle and the pitch is being uncovered, which is good I guess ‚Äì though looking around and looking out my window, the weather does not scream ‚ÄúCRICKET!‚Äù There‚Äôs play in the champo pretty much across the country ‚Äì they‚Äôre delayed at Trent Bridge and Canterbury, but going strong everywhere else. This country, eh? Anyhow, follow the action here: ‚ÄúShame about this rain, eh,‚Äù laments Andrew Cosgrove. ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt agree more about the new stands, they look fantastic. When you bemoaned the loss of the toilets, I thought you were talking about my greatest grievance. I used to love the magnificent urinals at the Nursery End. I think they might have been Edwardian, acres of porcelain. The fact that the entrance and egress appeared to have been designed by someone who had given absolutely no thought to the most efficient way of getting hundreds of men in and out just added to the charm, somehow. I believe those toilets are no more, but it turns out you were talking about a different toilet.‚Äù I know your ones too, and yes, I agree ‚Äì I like to believe that the small opening and vast expanse was a metaphor for opening a window into the soul. Anyway, how is learning every note of a classic album not more crucial than matrices, Great Expectations and the French idioms on page 175 of Tricolore? ‚ÄúCruciality is relative,‚Äù philosophises Matt Dony, ‚Äúand only truly understood when we can look back on a period and place it within a wider context. (My GCSE year, for example, was supposed to be ‚Äòcrucial‚Äô, and yet the fact that I wasted it learning every guitar note of Mellon Collie And The Infinite Sadness appears to have done no lasting damage). When taking about upcoming time periods, I would argue that we only ever have the potential for cruciality. The first hour‚Äôs play could be crucial. We won‚Äôt know until we‚Äôre looking back on it. And, anyway, time is a man-made construct, and nothing truly matters. Happy Friday, everyone.‚Äù That takes me back ‚Äì I too did GCSEs in what graffiti around Golders Green and Camden Town knew as ‚ÄúNutty 9T5‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt have the dexterity for guitar-playing, but did visit Virgin Megastore and ease open the plastic protecting various sheet music books, in order to copy down lyrics into my homework diary. Failing that, I would wait until my Walkman battery ran down and my tapes played slowly; who needs the internet? The rain doesn‚Äôt look ‚Äúset in‚Äù but doesn‚Äôt look likely to disappear in the next bit. We‚Äôve not been advised about a potential start-time which isn‚Äôt a great sign. Would it ever be possible to take, say, six weeks in the calendar and hold a Test-match World Cup? Last 16, last eight, semi-finals and final, one and done? I daresay I would watch it. The new Compton and Edrich stands look the absolute business, don‚Äôt they? I have reservations ‚Äì boxes in the middle of the two tiers, sending the upper deck further from the action, less sun for those so inclined ‚Äì but the view from the bottom looks so much better. Ultimately, you‚Äôve got to credit the MCC in that every single ground improvement has been an absolute belter, on its own and as part of the whole. One minor tragedy, though, is the loss of the greatest toilets in the world ‚Äì those were in the Warner, and featured a window which afforded members a view of the middle. It‚Äôs still raining, but that‚Äôs sort of good news. It means we should have play through all five days ‚Äì and, as per the below, prospect of cricket is better than no cricket ‚Äì on top of which, for those that can it‚Äôs worth investigating tickets for Sunday because there may be some. Tim Southee had a chat with Sky, discussing the inswinger he‚Äôs found and with which he dismissed Zak Crawley yesterday. It‚Äôs incredible really ‚Äì how good he‚Äôs been without one ‚Äì and how watching James Anderson can leave one taking such behaviour for granted ‚ÄúIf the first hour is crucial, yet is lost to rain, does that hour remain crucial or does the next one take on that role?‚Äù wonders Phil Withall. ‚ÄúDoes time lose its meaning if nothing happens during it or does it become more valuable for that reason? Do I need help?‚Äù These are the issues we‚Äôre here to tackle. I‚Äôm using my crucial first hour to debate the contents of my cool bag for tomorrow ‚Äì did you know that Jews are forbidden from carrying on Saturdays, but if various posts are erected in the correct manner this no longer applies, and it‚Äôs now possible to do so all the way from Woodside Park to St John‚Äôs Wood, yes I will be making kiddush and hamotzi ‚Äì but otherwise, I‚Äôm not sure. I would, though, like to know which are the uncrucial hours, and am certain that time is illmatic, keep static like wool fabric. Ah man, it‚Äôs so good to be back. Rain during cricket is somehow the best rain there is and the worst rain there is all at the same time. We‚Äôre looking at Joe Root, who may well hold the key to this Test. We‚Äôve been here many times before ‚Äì him looking sensational and in total command of the bowlers ‚Äì but too often, he‚Äôs allowed himself to get out without grinding home his artistry. It might be that he‚Äôs over the bump, and though today won‚Äôt prove anything either way, a serious score will make a statement. Yesssss. Just caught a ‚Äúfirst hour is crucial‚Äù in a Sky montage, but was looking at my fingers so not sure who bestowed it upon us. More news as I get it. Alan Gardner, OBO alumnus, has confirmed on Cricinfo that it‚Äôs raining at Lord‚Äôs, so there‚Äôs a strong chance we‚Äôll have to spend the first bit of the morning amusing ourselves. As such, aitch or haitch? The Fresh Prince of Manny has strong thoughts on the topic. Not that far from haitch cue, I‚Äôm afraid it‚Äôs been raining, and the morning prognosis ‚Äì courtesy of the Met Office ‚Äì is not a good one. But we should still have enough time for the match to unfold. A normal person looks at this Test match ‚Äì the players, the conditions, the game ‚Äì says draw and moves on. Except nothing about Test matches ‚Äì nor the people obsessed by them ‚Äì says normal, so here we are at the start of day three simply saying more more more more more more. The thing with sport is that though most encounters aren‚Äôt classics ‚Äì like everyday life ‚Äì the possibility of a classic always exists ‚Äì not like everyday life ‚Äì a truth that is perfectly encapsulated by this perfect thing of ours. So here we are. Yeah, alright. Anyone with the vaguest familiarity with English cricket is expecting a glorious collapse rich with symbolism and allegory ‚Äì the sensation is gorgeously palpable ‚Äì but anyone with the vaguest familiarity with this England cricket team is wondering which of the various freaks is poised to do something definitive ‚Äì the sensation is hilariously ill-conceived. And similar is so of New Zealand, which really sets up what we‚Äôre about to see. With runs on the board they should be the happier side, except with not as many runs on the board as they‚Äôd have liked, they‚Äôre the more vulnerable side. Or, put another way, this is why we‚Äôre here. Go well, everyone.

The country had been seen as the one ray of sunshine for UK holidaymakers, and the decision will be a serious blow to the country‚Äôs tourism industry. It‚Äôs all the more baffling as it comes less than a week since 15,000 British football fans were allowed to travel to Porto to watch the Champions League final between Chelsea and Manchester City. Whether you are due to fly back shortly or have a holiday booked, find out how Portugal‚Äôs removal from Covid ‚Äògreen list‚Äô will affect you: Social distancing is likely to remain ‚Äúpart of people‚Äôs response‚Äù to Covid-19 for as long as the virus persists, Mark Drakeford has said. The Welsh first minister told a press conference in Cardiff: I think that social distancing remains one of the strongest defences that we have against the risks that the virus continues to pose. He said he had been ‚Äúvery struck‚Äù by people in Wales continuing to be careful about keeping their distance from others and moving aside to create space. I‚Äôm not certain myself that there is a huge thirst for people to give up some of the safeguards that we are all able to contribute in the way that we behave in our lives. I think they will remain part of the repertoire, here in Wales, during the rest of the summer, maybe into the rest of this year. Whether we will be able to move from them being mandatory to just things that we advise people about and ask people to do in their own lives, I think that will depend upon whether we continue to see improvements in the position here in Wales. But as part of a personal repertoire of things that every one of us can do to keep ourselves and others safe, I think they will remain part of people‚Äôs response to this public health crisis for as long as coronavirus persists. Wales‚Äôs first minister Mark Drakeford has said it is ‚Äúvery good news‚Äù that the UK‚Äôs Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has approved the use of the Pfizer vaccine in 12- to 15-year-olds. He told a press conference in Cardiff: It‚Äôs not the end of the journey because now the JCVI has to consider that and we will follow the JCVI‚Äôs advice as we have throughout. If the JCVI does recommend that we go ahead and vaccinate young people in that age group, then we have already been in conversation with the sector about the best way that we can do that. A little bit does depend on timing, how quickly we get that advice, whether there‚Äôs anything that can be done in the remaining part of this summer term, or whether we end up carrying out vaccinations when children return to school in the autumn. Drakeford said there was already a programme for vaccinating young people against seasonal flu in Welsh schools. The Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, received an alert from the test-and-trace app to say he had come into contact with someone with coronavirus, less than a week after returning from Portugal. The senior Tory recently returned from Porto, where he had travelled with his son, Will, to support Chelsea in the Champions League final last Saturday. The Cabinet Office confirmed Gove had been alerted by the NHS Covid app. A spokesperson said: He has followed Covid-19 regulations and guidance at all times and will continue to do so. After being notified by test and trace on Thursday, four days after he returned from Portugal, Gove had to abandon a meeting with the prime minister, Boris Johnson, and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, who had been discussing recovery from the pandemic with the leaders of the devolved nations via video link. Rather than self-isolating for 10 days, Gove will take lateral flow tests each morning for seven days as part of a pilot scheme to measure the testing effectiveness of alternatives to quarantining. As long as participants test negative, they will be able to leave their homes ‚Äúto carry out essential activity‚Äù. Read more here: EasyJet said it would operate larger planes and additional flights to bring UK holidaymakers back from Portugal before quarantine rules come into force on Tuesday. More than 1,000 additional seats have been added on routes from Faro to Gatwick, Luton, Manchester and Bristol, PA Media reports. EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren said: We know first-hand from our customers what a blow this sudden decision to put Portugal on the amber list is. With many British tourists currently in Portugal our priority is to help the customers who need to return ahead of the Tuesday deadline. We are providing over 1,000 additional seats from Portugal to the UK by flying larger aircraft on flights and adding some additional flights where there is demand. And, for customers who need support with testing requirements, we‚Äôre working with approved testing partner Collinson to provide support to customers in Portugal who need to arrange new tests. NHS England data shows a total of 10,680,734 jabs given to people in the Midlands between December 8 and June 3, including 6,266,457 first doses and 4,414,277 second doses. This compares with 4,464,199 first doses and 2,718,404 second doses given to people in London, a total of 7,182,603 jabs. Meanwhile the south-west has given 3,533,943 first doses and 2,591,465 second doses, making a total of 6,125,408. The breakdown for the other regions is: East of England: 3,985,642 first doses and 2,739,368 second doses, making 6,725,010 in total. North-east and Yorkshire: 5,202,008 first and 3,579,730 second doses, making 8,781,738 in total. North-west: 4,232,565 first and 2,920,116 second doses, making 7,152,681 in total. South-east: 5,441,673 first and 3,730,063 second doses, making 9,171,736 in total. Holidaymakers scrambling for flights home from Portugal before new quarantine requirements come into force are being charged hundreds of pounds. People arriving in the UK from Portugal after 4am on Tuesday will need to self-isolate at home for 10 days after the government moved it from the green list to the amber list. A seat on a Ryanair flight from the capital Lisbon to Manchester on Monday costs ¬£339, whereas travel on the same route is available for just ¬£75 on Wednesday. British Airways is charging ¬£348 for flights from Faro to London Heathrow on Sunday and Monday, but the price drops to ¬£137 on Tuesday. The airline said it would operate more flights to meet demand for people returning home. Tui, the UK‚Äôs largest tour operator, said it had 9,500 customers in Portugal but that was already due to have fallen to 2,000 by Tuesday because of the end of half-term for schoolchildren. A spokeswoman told PA Media that half its customers with Portugal bookings for June have amended their trip ‚Äì mostly until summer 2022 ‚Äì while the other half plan to go ahead despite the quarantine rules. She added: There is a lot of bewilderment and real frustration and confusion about what is happening. The firm is allowing consumers to change dates in response to Portugal moving to the amber list, but is not offering refunds as the Foreign Office does not advise against travel to the country. England‚Äôs R number has risen slightly to between 1 and 1.2, according to latest figures released by by the government‚Äôs Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). Last week, the figure stood at between 1 and 1.1. Covid infections in England are growing at a rate of between 0% and 3% per day. For those who need a refresher on what the R number means, it is a measure of the average number of people one infected person will go on to infect. If R is above 1, an outbreak can grow exponentially, but if it is below 1, the outbreak shrinks. The NHS cannot provide thousands of extra doses of Covid-19 vaccines to Blackburn with Darwen borough, despite it having the highest infection rate in the UK and a death rate almost a third higher than the national average. The local MP said it ‚Äúbeggared belief‚Äù that Blackburn‚Äôs repeated pleas to continue surge vaccinations had been knocked back, arguing the move will place the NHS under ‚Äúoverwhelming and unnecessary pressure‚Äù. Correspondence seen by the Guardian shows Blackburn‚Äôs director of public health warning the NHS that not providing additional doses would lead to avoidable deaths and the NHS being swamped within four weeks, calling it ‚Äúunfair, unjust and avoidable‚Äù. In mid-May 19,500 extra doses were sent to Blackburn and surrounding areas to distribute by 30 May after an outbreak of the Delta variant of Covid, which originated in India. Since then, the rolling seven-day infection rate in Blackburn has increased to 436.2 per 100,000 people, almost 14 times higher than the UK average of 32.1 per 100,000. Concerned about the rise, Dominic Harrison, Blackburn‚Äôs director of public health, wrote to the NHS asking to be allowed to extend surge vaccination for another fortnight, with at least 1,000 extra doses offered to vaccinate everyone over 18 who was eligible every day. He said he was backed by Dr Sakthi Karunanithi, Lancashire‚Äôs director of public health. But their request was refused by Jane Scattergood, an NHS official leading the Covid-19 vaccination programme rollout in Lancashire and south Cumbria.

With the Delta variant driving the rise in case numbers, she revealed a total of 992 people tested positive for the virus on Thursday, the highest daily figure since 17 February, and that the number of new cases had more than tripled in the past month. Speaking at her regular Covid briefing, Sturgeon said that Scotland was at a ‚Äúcritical juncture‚Äù in the pandemic but stressed that the success of the vaccine programme meant ink between the number of cases and the number of people being hospitalised and dying because of the virus was not as strong as it has been previously. The warning comes as It comes as parts of Scotland prepare to move down from level 2 to level 1 of lockdown restrictions from midnight tonight, while Glasgow ‚Äì which has been under tough lockdown restrictions for eight months ‚Äì meaning residents will be able to meet in homes in groups of up to six, from a maximum of three households. It also means that indoor licensed hospitality can reopen, and that people can travel again between Glasgow and other parts of the country. Hounslow council has tweeted to ask that people don‚Äôt turn up to Brentford Fountain Leisure Centre today and over the weekend for a vaccine unless they have an appointment. This is in response to a fake story which is being circulated on WhatsApp about mass walk-in vaccinations for those over 18. It‚Äôs unclear where the incorrect message originated from. The percentage of people testing positive for Covid-19 is estimated to have increased in north-west England, the east Midlands and south-west England. There are also signs of a possible increase in the West Midlands and London while the trend is uncertain for other regions, the ONS said. In many regions positivity rates are very low, meaning trends are difficult to identify since they are affected by small changes in the number of people testing positive from week to week, PA news reports. North-west England had the highest proportion of people of any region in England likely to test positive for coronavirus in the week to 29 May: around one in 280. South-east England had the lowest estimate: around one in 1,490. The decision to move Portugal to the Amber list is going to have a huge knock-on effect to the local economy in southern Portugal, a business owner told the Guardian. Cheryl Smith, who runs Figs on the Funcho, a wedding and retreat business in The Algarve, which was due to welcome guests on Saturday for a week-long painting holiday said she was ‚Äúdevastated‚Äù by the news and said the uncertainty of not knowing whether guests will arrive makes planning ‚Äúdifficult and stressful‚Äù. She said: Moving from green to amber will further increase the negative economic impact on the Algarve as they are heavily dependent on tourism. Many are dependent on the jobs and services in the tourism sector. During our painting and walking holiday experiences we encourage our visitors to purchase local, handmade or locally produced crafts by visiting nearby villages where we can promote the local heritage, architecture, culture, arts, crafts, tradition and gastronomy of our region. We choose meals at local family owned restaurants and we support local income by employing local guides, art tutors and cleaners from our area. The produce used to prepare meals at Figs on the Funcho are locally sourced as much as possible by shopping at our local village market. Even the honey served at breakfast is purchased from our local beekeepers who also tend to our lovely garden. Olive oil produced in our local area is used in our kitchen. It was very disheartening to receive the travel update two days before the start of our painting holiday as it causes turmoil and stress both for the organisers and holiday makers. However, she was optimistic Portugal will move back to the green list again soon. She said: Portugal is administering vaccines seven days a week to achieve the acceptable level so we are hoping we can receive tourists very soon again. Simon Smith, who is currently in Portugal, said his family had been racing to find Covid tests to get a return flight to the UK on Saturday morning. The property developer from Stamford, Lincolnshire, who owns a villa in the Lagos area, said he had visited five medical centres and the main hospital to try to get his family tested. He told PA Media he was turned away from one centre after it ran out of testing kits. Smith, who is abroad with his wife and two children, aged two and four, said: There were about 35 people in the queue, all British, and they told us, ‚Äòthe first 15 are okay, but the rest of you might as well go home because we don‚Äôt have enough tests‚Äô. There has just been no thought into it at all. I thought with the whole idea of the green list was that they were going to monitor it and give people plenty of time and notice to get flights and sort out problems with testing. He said the change was a ‚Äúreal kick in the teeth‚Äù. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really safe here in Portugal,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúOn the Algarve, there are very few cases, and all the restaurants and shops take it really seriously.‚Äù The family has been told the airport has a small amount of Covid tests available, so plan on turning up to their flight five hours early in the hopes of getting one. He said: If we can‚Äôt get that, we can‚Äôt fly. And then we are going to be stuck here, and then have to face 10 days‚Äô quarantine. I have meetings on Friday, I can‚Äôt afford 10 days‚Äô quarantine, it is a joke. Prof Christina Pagel of University College London points out on Twitter that there has been a ‚Äúmarked increase‚Äù in secondary school-age children testing positive for coronavirus. She said: We owe it to kids to keep cases low &amp; protect their education. The latest ONS data on infections has been released and show there has likely been an increase in the percentage of people testing positive for coronavirus in most areas of the UK. In England, the percentage of people testing positive has increased in the week ending 29 May 2021. The ONS estimates 85,600 people within the community population in England had Covid-19, equating to about one in 640 people, which is up from about one in 1,100 last week. This is the highest level since the week to 16 April. In Wales, there are early signs of an increase in the percentage of people testing positive in the week ending 29 May 2021, where the estimate is that 2,900 people in Wales had Covid-19, equating to about one in 1,050 people. In Northern Ireland, the trend in the percentage of people testing positive is uncertain in the week ending 29 May 2021. The ONS estimates that 2,300 people in Northern Ireland had Covid-19, equating to about one in 800 people. In Scotland, the percentage of people testing positive has likely increased in the two weeks up to 29 May 2021, however, the trend is uncertain in the week ending 29 May 2021. The estimate shows that 7,700 people in Scotland had Covid-19, equating to about one in 680 people. In the week ending 29 May 2021, the data analysts have seen an increase in cases in England that are not compatible with the UK variant B.1.1.7 (labelled Alpha by the World Health Organization); these are likely to be the variant B.1.617.2 (known as Delta), first identified in India. In the week ending 29 May 2021, there has been an increase in cases that are compatible with the UK variant B.1.1.7 (WHO ‚ÄúAlpha‚Äù) in Wales. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has approved the use of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine in 12- to 15-year-olds. The MHRA said the decision follows a ‚Äúrigorous review‚Äù of safety and effectiveness in that age group. Dr June Raine, MHRA chief executive, said: We have carefully reviewed clinical trial data in children aged 12 to 15 years and have concluded that the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine is safe and effective in this age group and that the benefits of this vaccine outweigh any risk. We have in place a comprehensive safety surveillance strategy for monitoring the safety of all UK-approved Covid-19 vaccines and this surveillance will include the 12- to 15-year age group. No extension to an authorisation would be approved unless the expected standards of safety, quality and effectiveness have been met. It will now be for the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) to advise on whether this age group will be vaccinated as part of the deployment programme. More than 2,000 children were involved in the clinical trial to determine the safety of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, the chair of the Commission on Human Medicines said. Prof Sir Munir Pirmohamed said: We have been very careful to take into consideration the younger age group and the benefits of this population being vaccinated against any potential risk of side-effects. There has been a thorough assessment and review of this data which was also looked at specifically by the CHM‚Äôs Paediatric Medicines Expert Advisory Group who are scientific experts within this age group, as well as the CHM‚Äôs Covid-19 Vaccines Benefit Risk Expert Working Group. We have concluded that based on the data we have seen on the quality, effectiveness and safety of the vaccine, its benefits do outweigh any risk. The MHRA will continue to scrutinise all of the suspected side-effects data received through the rigorous surveillance programme in place through the Yellow Card scheme and other safety surveillance measures for all of the Covid-19 vaccines used in the UK. Over 2,000 children aged 12-15 years were studied as part of the randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trials. There were no cases of Covid-19 from seven days after the second dose in the vaccinated group, compared with 16 cases in the placebo group. In addition, data on neutralising antibodies showed the vaccine working at the same level as seen in adults aged 16-25 years. These are extremely positive results. Britain‚Äôs medicines regulator said on Friday it had extended approval of the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech so it can be used on 12- to 15-year-olds. Dr June Raine, the chief executive of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, said: We have carefully reviewed clinical trial data in children aged 12 to 15 years and have concluded that the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine is safe and effective in this age group and that the benefits of this vaccine outweigh any risk. She added it would be up to the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation to decide whether this age group would come under the vaccine deployment programme. First Minister Mark Drakeford said Wales‚Äôs coronavirus restrictions would continue to ease if the growing number of cases of the Indian variant was not leading to increased pressure on hospitals. He told PA Media: It‚Äôs not risk-free, that strategy, because that assumes that there will be greater circulation of the virus in the community and when you allow coronavirus to circulate the opportunities for new variants emerging increase as well. But if the link between falling ill and needing to be treated in hospital is broken, then it will mean that in the future we will have to find ways of living with coronavirus more like the way we live with the seasonal flu. Drakeford said part of the reason he was pausing further easing of Wales‚Äôs rules for three weeks was due to evidence the variant was causing greater hospital admissions among young people. He said: The considerable majority of those people are people who have not been vaccinated, but amongst their number are people who have received the vaccine. That‚Äôs why the advice we have is that two more weeks of evidence really will be very helpful to us in understanding better where this new variant is having its impact. One of the UK‚Äôs leading scientists has called on the prime minister to donate 20% of the UK‚Äôs Covid vaccines to other countries in an effort to try to save lives and stem the spread of coronavirus variants. The head of the Wellcome Trust, Sir Jeremy Farrar, and the executive director of Unicef UK, Steven Waugh, have published an open letter to Boris Johnson appealing for the UK to set an example ahead of the G7 summit in Cornwall, which begins in a week‚Äôs time. UK science played a core part in ‚Äúbreathtaking advances‚Äù that have enabled vaccines to be developed, which is the way out of the pandemic, they say in their letter. They write: At home, the UK vaccination rollout has been a phenomenal success and has already saved countless lives. Yet, globally too many countries still lack doses to protect healthcare workers and the most vulnerable. As president of the G7, the UK has the opportunity to set the standard for global action on sharing doses. Three months ago, you proudly pledged that the UK would share vaccines with the world. Now we ask that you turn this pledge into reality. Read the full story here: Prevalence of self-reported long Covid was greatest in people aged 35 to 69 years, females, those living in the most deprived areas, those working in health or social care and those with another activity-limiting health condition or disability, the ONS found. There is no universally agreed definition of long Covid but it covers a broad range of symptoms such as fatigue, muscle pain and difficulty concentrating, PA Media reports. Fatigue (weakness or tiredness) was the most common symptom reported as part of individuals‚Äô experience of long Covid up until 2 May (547,000 out of 1 million people), followed by shortness of breath (405,000), muscle ache (313,000) and difficulty concentrating (285,000). The Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, said he had wanted the UK to wait longer before its original decision to put Portugal on the green list because coronavirus figures showed it was only ‚Äúmarginally‚Äù qualified for that status. Drakeford told PA Media: The figures showed that while Portugal was in a position to be put on the green list, it was only marginally so. I would have waited a bit longer to see whether that position was strengthening so that you can be confident that it would be on the green list, or whether because it was so close to the margin things could have moved against it being on the green list. Now things have deteriorated in Portugal and I know that will be a very significant challenge now for people who are already on holiday there to face quarantining when they return. An estimated 1 million people in private households in the UK reported experiencing ‚Äúlong Covid‚Äù in the four weeks to 2 May, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Of these people, an estimated 869,000 first had Covid-19 ‚Äì or suspected they had Covid-19 ‚Äì at least 12 weeks previously, while 376,000 first had the virus or suspected they had the virus at least one year ago, PA Media reports. Long Covid was estimated to be adversely affecting the day-to-day activities of 650,000 people, with 192,000 reporting that their ability to undertake day-to-day activities had been limited a lot. Crist√≥v√£o Norte, Portuguese MP for the Algarve, said he is ‚Äúperplexed‚Äù by the British government‚Äôs decision to remove Portugal from the green list. He told BBC Radio 4‚Äôs Today programme: We were not expecting the decision because there haven‚Äôt been major changes in Portugal, just a spike in the Lisbon area. But we have 66 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. Our rate of transmission is more or less the UK rate, so we weren‚Äôt expecting this decision from the English government. We wear masks, we obey the rules, we maintain social distancing, vaccination is growing steadily. So I‚Äôm a little bit perplexed. Norte added: I have to respect the decision. We would like to know sooner. This causes great uncertainty. He said it is ‚Äúa huge blow‚Äù on the economy, adding that the country heavily depends on British tourism. Julia Lo Bue-Said, chief executive of travel agent group Advantage Travel Partnership, said the decision in relation to Portugal was ‚Äúan absolute devastating blow‚Äù for consumers and the industry, PA Media reports. She told BBC Radio 4‚Äôs Today programme: It now throws confidence completely out of the window. It puts the industry in a really difficult position and consumers in a difficult position in order to be able to plan effectively. Tim Hawkins, chief strategy officer at Manchester Airports Group, which owns Manchester, Stansted and East Midlands airports, claimed the government ‚Äúisn‚Äôt willing to take any risk at all‚Äù, and urged ministers to ‚Äútrust in the traffic light system‚Äù. He told Times Radio: For people coming back from green countries you have to take a pre-departure test, you have to take a test when you come back. There is not a free flow of people coming back from those countries. There are safeguards, there are measures in place to control those kinds of things, but the government seems to have ignored those. Portugal is not the only country that has moved on the traffic light rating system. Afghanistan, Bahrain, Costa Rica, Sudan, and Trinidad and Tobago have also been placed on the red list, meaning people arriving in the UK from those nations must stay in a quarantine hotel for 11 nights. The changes come into effect at 4am on Tuesday. The Delta variant of coronavirus, first discovered in India, is anywhere between 30% to 100% more transmissible than the previously dominant Alpha (or Kent) variant, according to Prof Neil Ferguson, whose Covid modelling was key to the UK‚Äôs first lockdown. Ferguson is a leading epidemiologist at Imperial College London who advised the government at the beginning of the pandemic. He told BBC Radio 4‚Äôs Today programme: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre certainly getting more data. Unfortunately, the news is not as positive as I would like in any respect about the Delta variant. The best estimate at the moment is this variant may be 60% more transmissible than the Alpha [Kent] variant. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs some uncertainty around that depending on assumption and how you analyse the data, between about 30% and maybe even up to 100% more transmissible.‚Äù It comes as the date of lifting lockdown approaches, with 21 June the proposed time when the government will remove ‚Äúall legal limits on social contact‚Äù, although some social distancing and mask-wearing rules will remain. Read the full story here: Here‚Äôs a clip of Prof Neil Ferguson talking about the potential easing of restrictions on 21 June. He says the Delta variant may be 60% more transmissible than the variant first identified in Kent and it is doubling across the country ‚Äúabout every nine days‚Äù. Robert Jenrick said there was still ‚Äúnothing at the moment that suggests that we won‚Äôt be able to move forward‚Äù with the next stage of lifting restrictions on 21 June. He told BBC Radio 4‚Äôs Today programme: We‚Äôve got a further 10 days until we are going to make that decision on or around June 14, so during that period we‚Äôll see where are we with hospitalisations, with deaths, where are we with the vaccine rollout ‚Äì we‚Äôre doing everything we possibly can to expedite that ‚Äì and then at that point, we‚Äôll make our final decision. Asked whether measures such as wearing masks and working from home could continue after 21 June, Jenrick told the Today programme: Well, there are options that are clearly available to the government. We set out within the road map what would be expected to happen at the next stage and we want to try to stick to that if we possibly can. All of us are moving everything we can to achieve that. But of course, we keep these things under review and we‚Äôre also asking people to continue to exercise caution in their daily lives. Communities secretary Robert Jenrick insisted a watchlist, where countries at risk of moving from the green to amber list are placed, is still an option. He told BBC Radio 4‚Äôs Today programme: The watchlist system remains, if it‚Äôs possible to do that. If you‚Äôre seeing that cases are gradually rising, that positivity is increasing, then one may be able to use that and if you can, obviously it‚Äôs preferable to do so because you want to give people and the industry that forward guidance. But if you‚Äôre seeing new variants or versions of variants emerging, you may need to act more swiftly, and I think that is the right thing to do. First minister Mark Drakeford has said he believes Wales is ‚Äúright to be concerned‚Äù about the Delta variant of Covid-19. ‚ÄúIt is spreading very quickly in the north-west of England, right on our border,‚Äù Drakeford told BBC Radio 4‚Äôs Today programme. We know it‚Äôs more transmissible. There is some evidence that it is driving more people into hospitals. Drakeford said the country‚Äôs chief medical officer had advised on Thursday that Wales should ‚Äúphase in‚Äù its move to alert level one over the next three weeks. He said a cluster of cases of the Delta variant in Llandudno was believed to be ‚Äúunder the control‚Äù of public health teams in the area but 300 people were self-isolating as a result of it. He said: We‚Äôve had examples in schools and in workplaces in that part of Wales and our caution is grounded in what the science is saying to us about the potential impact of that new variant more widely in Wales. Dame Irene Hays, owner of travel agent Hays Travel, said she was ‚Äúsurprised and obviously disappointed‚Äù to hear of Portugal‚Äôs move off the green list for travel from the UK. She told Sky News: [I‚Äôm] disappointed for our customers, disappointed for the travel industry and really disappointed for Portugal, because they‚Äôve tried so hard and their infection rates are so low. I know they‚Äôre rising in Lisbon, but it‚Äôs quite a way from the Algarve, which is where most of the tourists are. Asked if she felt that nuance had not been taken into consideration, Hays said: It would be nice if it was a nuanced approach, but we are where we are. It is ‚Äúdifficult‚Äù and ‚Äúvery frustrating‚Äù for holidaymakers, particularly those who had just started their trips, she added. While some people are still booking holidays for the summer, Hays said the ‚Äúvast majority‚Äù are instead booking for autumn or 2022. Moving Portugal off the UK‚Äôs green list is ‚Äúan overreaction‚Äù, an epidemiologist in the popular holiday destination has said. Prof Henrique Barros, the president of Portugal‚Äôs National Health Council, said the overall situation in the country is ‚Äúrelatively stable‚Äù. The communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, said positive cases had doubled in the last three weeks in Portugal. Barros told Sky News: We didn‚Äôt reach such an increase, except as I said in a specific area around Lisbon. The overall picture in the country, we didn‚Äôt reach such figures. Asked about Portugal being moved to the amber list for travel, he said: I think it‚Äôs an overreaction. But of course you know that people moving from one country to the other, it‚Äôs obviously a risk for both countries, of course. We know that we should pay attention to the situation. He said it is mainly people aged under 40 and 30 where a rise in infections is being seen, and that with people over 50 ‚Äúwe have a very, very low incidence of cases‚Äù. The health chief said hospital admissions at the present time are ‚Äúvery low‚Äù, at less than 25 people per million, while those in intensive care are at less than five people per million. Barros stressed that officials in the country ‚Äúpay a lot of attention‚Äù to monitoring the virus. Robert Jenrick said he did not know how many cases there were of the new Nepal variant of the coronavirus. Speaking to the Today programme, the communities secretary said it appeared to be a ‚Äúfurther mutation of the Indian variant‚Äù. When asked how the Nepal variant could be used as a reason to remove Portugal from the green list if he did not know how many cases there were, Jenrick said: We have seen that there are cases of it, they are picking this up, and we took the decision that it was better to be cautious whilst we learn about this new mutation of the variant. Jenrick said he was not aware of any cases of the Nepal variant in the UK. He said Portuguese scientists had detected the variant, but said: What we don‚Äôt yet know is how prevalent it is in Portugal ‚Äì but more importantly than that, whether this really is a significant problem. You could, of course, wait whilst we do that research and then, God forbid, we learn that it is very virulent, that it does compromise our vaccines, or we can take a safety-first approach. He was also on BBC Breakfast defending the decision to add Portugal to the amber list, saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs right to be careful‚Äù. The communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, said the decision not to move Portugal off the green list until Tuesday meant people could travel home in an ‚Äúorderly‚Äù manner. He told BBC Breakfast: We think it‚Äôs sensible to give people a period of time to return home to the UK. As I say, they‚Äôve got until Tuesday to do so, that‚Äôs designed to help people to come back in an orderly manner, to not see scenes at airports where people are crowded together. There are risks involved in creating that sort of situation. We have taken a cautious approach by taking Portugal off the green list, putting it back onto the amber list, and I think that‚Äôs the right thing to do to protect the public. Prof Neil Ferguson said most people in hospital with the virus have not had a vaccine. He told BBC Radio 4‚Äôs Today Programme: It‚Äôs important to say that most people being hospitalised at the moment with this variant, and with any Covid variant, are unvaccinated. So, it‚Äôs clear that the vaccines are still having a substantial effect, though it may be slightly compromised. He said they are still waiting for data on how much the Delta variant can evade the immunity which protects people against being admitted to hospital. He said: The data being reported relates to unvaccinated people, so if you haven‚Äôt been vaccinated there appears to be, both from Public Health England data and from Public Health Scotland data independently, about a twofold increased risk of hospitalisation. Professor Neil Ferguson said he thinks the data is ‚Äúpointing this week in a more negative direction than it was last week‚Äù and that it would be a ‚Äúvery difficult judgment call‚Äù when asked about whether the 21 June lifting of restrictions needs to be delayed. The epidemiologist and former government adviser told BBC Radio 4‚Äôs Today programme: First of all, it‚Äôs not my job to make that decision, thankfully. I think the data is pointing this week in a more negative direction than it was last week, so it points towards the direction of being cautious. I think balancing, clearly, people‚Äôs desire ‚Äì and there clearly is a built-up desire to get back to normal ‚Äì against the potential risk is a very difficult judgment call.

Built by the British architect Edwin Lutyens between 1911 and 1931, the parliament buildings and their grand roadways and water channels follow the form established by the Islamic rulers of Iran and elaborated by the Islamic sultanate of Samarkand and the Mughal rulers of India. Lutyens designed perhaps the most important Islamic-inspired edifice of modern times. The buildings quote architectural emblems from Hindu temples and palaces, but the grand plan follows the design of Mughal-Islamic landscape with a light nod to Roman triumphalism. It is, in my view, the greatest set of government buildings anywhere in the world. Unsurprisingly, the Islamic origin of these buildings offends the current regime in Delhi. It is why the tyrant Modi and his henchmen are destroying it. As I write, the destruction is under way. It is an abomination that Modi‚Äôs hate-filled campaign to de-Islamify India is allowed to continue via the destruction of a world-class monument. Astonishingly, the UN heritage forum is silent and world heritage bodies have kept their mouths firmly closed. Are they afraid of Modi, or do they not care what happens in India? Modi has appointed third-rate Bimal Patel as his architect. Patel will design its replacement much in the way that Albert Speer followed his F√ºhrer‚Äôs lead, but, of course, Patel does not have an iota of Speer‚Äôs talent. This ideologically driven, hate-filled destruction follows the demolition of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya in 1992 and the vandalism of Islamic and Mughal monuments all over India. Modi appears to want nothing less than the obliteration of all the Islamic monuments of India and the removal of the 200 million Indian Muslims.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics said Friday that the unemployment rate had fallen to 5.8% from 6.1% in April, still significantly higher than the 3.8% unemployment rate recorded in February 2020 before Covid 19 hit the US but less than half its 14.8% peak in April last year. The news comes one month after the labor department shocked economists by announcing the US had added just 266,000 new jobs in April ‚Äì far below the 1m gain that had been expected. May‚Äôs gains were less than economists had predicted and with the level of employment is still 7.6m jobs below its pre-pandemic peak, economics group Capital Economics calculates it would take more than 12 months at the current pace to fully eradicate the shortfall. April‚Äôs report led to sparring between the Biden administration and Republicans who claimed higher levels of unemployment benefits were keeping people from returning to work and this month‚Äôs lukewarm report is unlikely to end that row. But there are signs of a strong rebound across the US economy. Worker filings for unemployment benefits have dropped by 35% since late April and fell to a pandemic low of 385,000 last week, the labor department said Thursday. Here‚Äôs the full story: Ben Casselman of the New York Times has written a really interesting Twitter thread, highlighting some key points from the US jobs report: The US dollar has lost ground following the jobs report. That also suggests traders are more confident that the Federal Reserve won‚Äôt tighten its bond-buying stimulus program soon, with employment gains below forecasts. This has pushed the pound up by almost a cent today, to nearly $1.42, close to the three-year high of $1.425 set earlier this week. Tech stocks, which are sensitive to interest rate concerns, are leading the risers on the Dow. Intel (+1.4%), Microsoft (+1.36%), Salesforce.com (+1.2%) and Apple (+1%) are all rallying following the jobs report. Drinks giants Coca-Cola and construction equipment maker Caterpillar are both up 1.1%, suggesting optimism about the economic recovery and the reopening trade. The US stock market has opened higher, as Wall Street traders welcome today‚Äôs Non-Farm Payroll report. The 292,000 increase in leisure and hospitality jobs shows that the economy is recovering. Plus, the weaker-than-expected payroll gains could calm worries that the Federal Reserve feels pressure to slow its bond-buying programme soon. Dow Jones industrial average: up 142 points or 0.4% at 134,719 S&amp;P 500: up 25 points or 0.6% at 4,218 points Nasdaq Composite: up 125 points or 0.9% at 13,740 points Mike Bell, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, says the 559,000 payroll increase is a ‚ÄòGoldilocks‚Äô number (as every child knows, she liked her porridge not too hot, or too cold). ‚ÄúAnother weaker than expected payrolls number is allowing investors to relax a little about the prospect of Fed tightening, while still demonstrating that the hardest hit sectors of the labour market are bouncing back. ‚ÄúThis goldilocks scenario of a labour market recovery that is not too cold to raise concerns about the economy, but not too hot to prompt fears about faster than expected monetary policy tightening, is supportive of equity markets.‚Äù Adding over half a million new jobs would be ‚Äòamazing‚Äô in a normal month, says Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics. But these are not normal times....and job creation is slower than hoped. The 559,000 gain in non-farm payrolls in May was at least an improvement on the 278,000 gain in April but, with the level of employment still 7.6 million below its pre-pandemic peak, it would take more than 12 months at that pace to fully eradicate the shortfall. Only a few months ago we had expected to see several months‚Äô worth of gains north of one million as the economy reopened, but labour supply is bouncing back much more slowly than demand.... Overall, in any other set of circumstances, monthly gains in excess of half a million would be amazing but, with a 7.6 million shortfall, it will be some time at that pace before the Fed‚Äôs ‚Äúsubstantial further progress‚Äù has been met. Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, says the US jobs market has moved into ‚Äòsecond gear‚Äô. He‚Äôs encouraged by the rise in teaching and childcare jobs (see earlier post). ‚ÄúThe May jobs report was a major improvement over April‚Äôs, but we‚Äôre still not in full-speed-ahead mode, despite plummeting COVID-19 cases. That the economy is reopening was evident in the near 300,000-job increases in leisure and hospitality, which account for half the total increase. Also significant: the high numbers of teachers and childcare workers hired back. This should have a multiplier effect on jobs in the coming months, as working parents who needed to stop or curtail working due to kids at home can resume their careers. Evidence that many workers in the labor force are choosing to stay on the sidelines: the labor force participation rate is still low at 61.6%. Overall, this is hiring in second gear, and we have the potential to accelerate once some bottlenecks and barriers to working disappear.‚Äù Willem Sels, chief investment officer, Private Banking and Wealth Management, HSBC, says there‚Äôs little danger of a ‚Äòbroad-based wage spiral‚Äô breaking out: ‚ÄúFollowing the big disappointment in the payroll data last month, today‚Äôs non-farm payroll release was closely watched, as investors assess whether the factors that limited job creation last month would be temporary or have persisted. In the end, the number bounced a bit less than expected, and there were no material revisions to last month‚Äôs number. It seems that some of the factors that weighed on the numbers last month are slowly easing, and that there continues to a be a slow but gradual return of workers to the labour market, but slower than expected. In our view, unemployment remains too high for a broad-based wage spiral to develop. Average hourly earnings in the US continue to rise last month, up around 0.5%, which may indicate that some firms are lifting pay to attract workers. That includes a rise in average hourly pay at leisure and hospitality firms (from $17.86 in April to $18.09 in May), where there have been reports of staff shortages. However, this has been a tricky area to analyze, because the pandemic has hit lower-paid jobs harder. The Bureau of Labor Statistics says: Average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls increased by 15 cents to $30.33 in May, following an increase of 21 cents in April. Average hourly earnings of private-sector production and nonsupervisory employees rose by 14 cents to $25.60 in May, following an increase of 19 cents in April. The data for the last 2 months suggest that the rising demand for labor associated with the recovery from the pandemic may have put upward pressure on wages. However, because average hourly earnings vary widely across industries, the large employment fluctuations since February 2020 complicate the analysis of recent trends in average hourly earning. More than half the 559,000 new jobs created in May were in the leisure and hospitality trade, where payrolls swelled by 292,000 as people flocked to bars and restaurants. Nearly two-thirds of the increase was in food services and drinking places (+186,000), with another 58,000 new jobs in amusements, gambling, and recreation, and 35,000 in accommodation. But, leisure and hospitality is still missing 2.5 million jobs since the pandemic began. In education, employment rose by 144,000 -- including 53,000 in local government education, by 50,000 in state government education, and by 41,000 in private education. Health care and social assistance added 46,000 jobs, including 22,000 new jobs in ‚Äúambulatory health care services‚Äù, and 18,000 in child day care services (perhaps reflecting increased demand from parents returning to work). Employment in information rose by 29,000, including 14,000 in motion picture and sound recording industries. Manufacturing employment rose by 23,000. That included a 25k gain in motor vehicles and parts, following a 38k fall in April (blamed on shortages of key parts such as computer chips). Transportation and warehousing added 23,000 jobs, while employment in wholesale trade increased by 20,000. But construction employment fell by 20,000, mainly due to job losses for nonresidential specialty trade contractors (-17,000). That may be due to the shortages of materials that have hit builders in America (and beyond...). Although below expectations, May‚Äôs job growth is an improvement on April‚Äôs weak payroll report. Zach Moller of Third Way Economic says there is ‚Äústeady improvement‚Äù, thanks to the Covid-19 vaccine rollouts. The US unemployment rate has fallen to 5.8%, from 6.1%, the jobs report shows. That‚Äôs partly thanks to firms taking on another 559,000 staff last month, helping to bring more people back into work. The BLS says: In May, the unemployment rate declined by 0.3 percentage point to 5.8%, and the number of unemployed persons fell by 496,000 to 9.3 million. These measures are down considerably from their recent highs in April 2020 but remain well above their levels prior to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic (3.5 percent and 5.7 million, respectively. But...the labor force participation rate has dipped to 61.6% from 61.7%. That can be a sign that more people have stopped looking for work, and dropped out of the jobs market (this can happen for many reasons, perhaps childcare commitments, or a lack of suitable vacancies...) Just in: The US economy added 559,000 jobs in May, as hiring falls below expectations for the second month in a row. Economists had expected around 650,000 new workers to be taken on last month, as the economy expanded strongly. April‚Äôs disappointing Non-Farm Payroll has been revised slightly higher to show 278,000 new hires, up from 266,000, but that still shows weak job growth. This may reinforce concerns that American firms are struggling to find labor amid the reopening rush. The Bureau of Labor Statistics says there were ‚Äúnotable job gains‚Äù in leisure and hospitality, in public and private education, and in health care and social assistance (details to follow!) Here‚Äôs our news story on the surge in UK construction growth...and costs... last month. Trade news: The United Kingdom has secured a new trade deal with Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. The deal cuts tariffs on some agricultural goods such as UK cheese exports to Norway, along with tariff reductions and quotas on pork, and poultry. UK wines and spirits including Scotch Whisky will also now be recognised in Norway and Iceland, the Department for International Trade says. In return, import tariffs on shrimps, prawns and haddock coming into the UK will be cut. That, the UK says, will cut costs for UK fish processing and support jobs in that sector. The deal also includes a chapter on digital trade -- allowing electronic-only paperwork on goods trade which could make importing and exporting smoother. There‚Äôs a cap on mobile phone roaming charges, recognition of professional qualifications, and British businesses can bid for around ¬£200m government contracts in partner countries. Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg told a news conference in Oslo that ‚Äúthe deal allows for growth in trade for both our countries‚Äù. But as the BBC points out, the deal won‚Äôt give the same opportunities as before Brexit. However, the Norwegian government said the deal with the UK would not restore all the advantages it had when both countries were in the EEA. ‚ÄúPrior to the UK‚Äôs exit from the EU, Norway enjoyed free movement of goods, services, capital and persons to the UK through the EEA agreement,‚Äù it said. ‚ÄúA free trade agreement will not provide similar access to the British market.‚Äù International Trade Secretary Liz Truss says it will boost trade: Today‚Äôs deal will be a major boost for our trade with Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, growing an economic relationship already worth ¬£21.6bn, while supporting jobs and prosperity in all four nations at home. Here‚Äôs some reaction: It may be too early for a tipple.. but those with a taste for wine may be interested in a new fund-raising drive from English winemaker Chapel Down. My colleague Kalyeena Makortoff has the details: Chapel Down is asking the public to take part in a fresh funding round worth up to ¬£7m that will help the business expand its vineyard in the North Downs and ramp up exports. It is the Kent company‚Äôs latest attempt to tap into investor enthusiasm for homegrown tipples as the democratisation of shareholding grows. Chapel Down plans to use the money to scale up its wineries and finish planting grapevines on the North Downs, where its vineyards are expected to produce an extra 500,000 bottles of English sparkling wine a year. Some of the cash will also help develop its online sales portal and export business. A virtual GP appointments app used by the NHS has announced a ¬£3bn US stock market listing after agreeing to a blank-cheque company merger that will net its British-Iranian founder almost ¬£1bn. Babylon‚Äôs reverse merger with Alkuri Global, a New York-listed special-purpose acquisition company (Spac), makes it the latest firm to take advantage of a growing Spac trend that makes it cheaper for private companies to go public. The Financial Times explains that regulators in Brussels and the UK have launched ‚Äúa joint assault‚Äù on Facebook‚Äôs use of customer data to dominate in core markets such as digital advertising. The Wall Street Journal say the moves are ‚Äúramping up regulatory scrutiny for the company in Europe‚Äù, adding: Both the European Commission‚Äîthe EU‚Äôs top antitrust enforcer‚Äîand the U.K.‚Äôs Competition and Markets Authority said Friday they are investigating whether Facebook repurposes data it gathers from advertisers who buy ads in order to give illegal advantages to its own services, including its Marketplace online flea market. Bloomberg has more details of the EU‚Äôs case: The European Commission said it will investigate whether Facebook misuses a trove of data gathered from advertisers to compete against them in classified ads. It will also check if the company unfairly ties its Marketplace small ad service to the social network. Friday‚Äôs move by the EU is the first time it‚Äôs escalated a case into Facebook‚Äôs behavior beyond the preliminary stages. It follows other high-profile cases targeting Google, Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. The EU previously fined Facebook for failing to provide correct information in the merger review of the WhatsApp takeover. Although the two investigations are separate, they were announced at the same time this morning. And both the UK‚Äôs CMA and the EC says they will ‚Äúseek to work closely‚Äù together as these independent inquiries develop. Facebook says it will cooperate fully with both the EU and UK investigations ‚Äúto demonstrate that they are without merit‚Äù. The social network giant explains: ‚ÄúMarketplace and Dating offer people more choices, and both products operate in highly competitive environment with many large incumbents‚Äù. We will continue to co-operate fully with the investigations to demonstrate that they are without merit.‚Äù Competition regulators in the UK and European Union have both launched investigations into Facebook, examining whether the social media giant is breaking competition rules. The UK‚Äôs Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it will look into whether Facebook is abusing a dominant position in the social media or digital advertising markets, by using advertising data to gain an unfair advantage in the classified ads and online dating sectors. The CMA will examine if Facebook has unfairly used the data gained from its digital advertising services, and from its single sign-on service (Facebook Login), to benefit its own services. In particular, it will look at Facebook Marketplace (which runs classified adverts), and its dating profile service Facebook Dating. Andrea Coscelli, chief executive of the CMA, says the regulator will conduct a thorough investigation. ‚ÄúWe intend to thoroughly investigate Facebook‚Äôs use of data to assess whether its business practices are giving it an unfair advantage in the online dating and classified ad sectors. ‚ÄúAny such advantage can make it harder for competing firms to succeed, including new and smaller businesses, and may reduce customer choice. Coscelli adds that the CMA will work closely with the European Commission... who have just announced their own antitrust investigation to assess whether Facebook violated EU competition rules. Again, the EC will examine if the tech giant used advertising data gathered in particular from advertisers in order to compete with them in markets where Facebook is active such as classified ads. The formal investigation will also assess whether Facebook has tied Marketplace to its social network, giving an unfair advantage in the online classified ads services and breaching the EU competition rules. It explains that online classified ads providers advertise their services on Facebook‚Äôs social network, while also competing with Facebook Marketplace. The EC says: Following a preliminary investigation, the Commission has concerns that Facebook may distort competition for the online classified ads services. In particular, Facebook might make use of the data obtained from competing providers in the context of their advertising on Facebook‚Äôs social network, to help Facebook Marketplace outcompete them. Facebook could, for instance, receive precise information on users‚Äô preferences from its competitors‚Äô advertisement activities and use such data in order to adapt Facebook Marketplace Competition chief, and executive vice-president, Margrethe Vestager, adds ‚ÄúFacebook is used by almost 3 billion people on a monthly basis and almost 7 million firms advertise on Facebook in total. Facebook collects vast troves of data on the activities of users of its social network and beyond, enabling it to target specific customer groups. We will look in detail at whether this data gives Facebook an undue competitive advantage in particular on the online classified ads sector, where people buy and sell goods every day, and where Facebook also competes with companies from which it collects data. In today‚Äôs digital economy, data should not be used in ways that distort competition.‚Äù Economist Richard Ramsey is also struck by the surge in construction costs - both for materials, and subcontractors: That last point suggests tradespeople are responding to the law of supply and demand, and pricing their time accordingly..... The UK building boom means that finding skilled construction workers is a real problem, says Duncan Brock, Group Director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply: ‚ÄúThe construction sector continued its expansion programme with a phenomenal acceleration in growth and the strongest for seven years as new orders filled in at the fastest rate for almost a quarter of a century. Residential work was back in the top spot as house building rose at the quickest pace since August 2014, serving as an antidote to the recent scarcity in housing for lets or buy, and driven by consumer demand and a boost from the stamp duty holiday. ‚ÄúBusy purchasing managers were under pressure to keep up and buying up at the fastest rate since April 1997, changing sourcing strategies to find depleting essential materials and stocking up just as supply chain problems continued to mount along with prices. With inflation for goods and raw materials at a 24-year high, companies will be concerned that much-needed profits will be eaten away as building projects take shape and could be held up by some of the longest delivery times on record. Skills shortages are also becoming a problem, with recruiters finding talented labour hard to find, as job creation was at robust levels and the threat of staffing cutbacks has become a distant memory.‚Äù This chart, from the PMI report, shows just how badly supply chains are creaking: The surge in input price inflation is quite startling -- it‚Äôs being driven by soaring material costs, and shortages of stocks such as timber, roof tiles, paint, taps and concrete. UK building firms are hiring new staff at the fastest rate in seven years, to handle the surge in demand in May. New project starts and a sustained recovery in construction workloads resulted in the biggest jump in staffing numbers since July 2014, the PMI report shows. And with new orders flooding in, sub-contractor usage increased at a survey-record pace. UK construction has recorded its fastest growth in almost seven years, fuelled by the biggest jump in new orders since at least April 1997. The latest survey of UK construction shows that the sector benefitted from surging order books, driven by demand for new homes amid rising economic confidence. However, cost pressures are also at record levels, as builders scramble to find the raw materials and parts they need. That‚Äôs according to data firm IHS Markit, whose Construction PMI index has jumped to 64.2 in May, up from April‚Äôs 61.6. That shows very fast growth, and is the strongest reading since September 2014 (anything over 50 shows expansion). Markit says the UK construction sector is on a ‚Äústrong recovery path‚Äù, with companies ‚Äúhighly upbeat‚Äù about growth prospects for the next year. New order volumes increased at the fastest pace since the survey began just over 24 years ago, while input cost inflation also hit a survey-record high during May. Business confidence among builders also jumped sharply, due to ‚Äúresurgent customer demand‚Äù, and optimism about the UK economic outlook following the successful vaccine roll out. Markit reports: House building (index at 66.3) was the best-performing category of construction activity in May, followed by commercial work (64.4) The latest increase in work on commercial projects was the steepest since August 2007, reflecting strong demand conditions following the reopening of customer-facing areas of the UK economy. Civil engineering activity (index at 61.3) also increased sharply during May, although the pace of expansion eased slightly since the previous month. Tim Moore, Economics Director at IHS Markit, says supply chains are struggling to cope with this rapid output growth, and the surge in new orders to the highest in at least two decades. ‚ÄúThere were widespread reports citing shortages of construction materials and wait times from suppliers lengthened considerably in comparison to those seen during April. Imbalanced supply and demand led to survey record increases in both purchasing prices and rates charged by sub-contractors. Despite severe challenges with materials availability, construction firms remain highly upbeat about their near-term growth prospects. Nearly two-thirds of the survey panel forecast an increase in output during the year ahead, while only one-in-thirteen forecast a decline. UK car sales continued to recover from their pandemic lows last month, but remain below their pre-Covid level. A total of 156,737 new cars were registered last month -- a jump of 674% compared with May 2020, during the first lockdown. This follows the reopening of car showrooms, and the relaxing of some pandemic restrictions in April and May. But, the market has not yet returned to normality. Sales are 14.7% lower than in May 2019, and over 13% below their average for the month over the last decade. And so far this year, car registrations are around 29% below their average levels. Sales to companies to businesses or organisations grew more than twice as fast as private purchases in May. These ‚Äòfleet sales‚Äô made up around half of all new vehicles hitting the road last month, totalling 79,435 sales -- ten times higher than a year ago. That shows improving business confidence, says the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said: ‚ÄúWith dealerships back open and a brighter, sunnier, economic outlook, May‚Äôs registrations are as good as could reasonably be expected. Increased business confidence is driving the recovery, something that needs to be maintained and translated in private consumer demand as the economy emerges from pandemic support measures. Demand for electrified vehicles is helping encourage people into showrooms, but for these technologies to surpass their fossil-fuelled equivalents, a long term strategy for market transition and infrastructure investment is required.‚Äù So far this year, plug-in vehicles have accounted for 13.8% of new car registrations, up from 7.2% a year earlier, with plug-in hybrids (PHEV) growing fastest. Fully electric cars have made up 7.5% of sales this year, with pure petrol engines still around half the market. The Covid-19 restrictions on touring and performing are also encouraging artists to cash in the value of their music rights, points out John Coldham, IP partner at law firm, Gowling WLG. Here‚Äôs his take on the sale of Joel Little‚Äôs song catalogue to Hipgnosis: The trend to buy up the rights to songs continues, with this latest investment being a continuation of that. There is nothing new about rights to creative works being bought and sold, but it is interesting that, as the world evolves into digital streaming, there has been a spate of such high profile sales recently. It is likely that some artists wish to realise the value of their catalogue now, rather than wait for the trickle of streaming revenues to come in, especially as they are not able to perform live so easily in the present environment. These sales demonstrate the value of intellectual property, and ensuring its ownership is properly documented will assist in realising that value later. Music news: Grammy Award-winning songwriter, producer and musician Joel Little has become the latest musician to sell their works to Hipgnosis Songs Fund. Little has worked with several leading musicians - including Taylor Swift, and Lorde, co-writing and producing her debut EP and her first album, Pure Heroine‚Äô. The sale of Little‚Äôs musical catalogue comes amid the boom in streaming under the pandemic. Several other big music names have also taken this move; Hipgnosis have recently signed deals with the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Neil Young, Fleetwood Mac guitarist Lindsay Buckingham, and Barry Manilow, along with Metallica and Michael Bubl√© producer Bob Rock. Reuters has more details: Little, whose songs Hipgnosis says have been streamed over 15 billion times, co-wrote and produced four songs on Swift‚Äôs 2019 album ‚ÄúLover,‚Äù including ‚ÄúMe!‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Man‚Äù. He has also collaborated with U.S. R&amp;B singer Khalid, and in 2014 won a Grammy award with New Zealand singer Lorde after co-producing and writing ‚ÄúRoyals‚Äù. In 2014 Little co-wrote or produced songs for the ‚ÄúThe Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 1‚Äù movie. The catalogue totals 178 songs, Hipgnosis said in a statement, and between 2017-2019 earned revenue of $8.6 million. It did not disclose the size of the deal. With airlines under pressure, the London stock market is effectively becalmed this morning. The FTSE 100 index has dropped by 10 points, or 0.15%, to 7054 points while the more UK-focused FTSE 250 is flat. Traders are keeping firmly to the sidelines ahead of May‚Äôs US jobs report -- to see whether hiring bounced back, and whether wages are rising (cue more fretting about inflation). Connor Campbell of SpreadEx explains: Analysts‚Äô estimates have the nonfarm number climbing to 645,000 [from 266k in April], with the unemployment rate falling from 6.1% to 5.9%. Average hourly earnings are, as ever, the one outlier, with expectations of 0.2% against the previous month‚Äôs 0.7%. Considering that nonfarm forecast lies somewhere between the levels expected last month, and the number produced last month, it will be interesting to see how investors react. It might hit that sweet spot ‚Äì strong enough to point to a continuing recovery, but not strong enough to prompt any action from the Fed. Although the travel sector is clearly struggling, the wider UK economy is rebounding from the pandemic. Overnight, a survey has shown that British employers took on permanent staff last month at the fastest rate since at least the late 1990s. There was also a rush for short-term staff, with temporary staff placements growing at the fastest in six years, according to the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) trade body and accountants KPMG. Kate Shoesmith, REC deputy chief executive officer, said. ‚ÄúWe now have a consistent picture over the past few months to show that confidence is growing and hiring plans are in motion.‚Äù The survey also found that companies are struggling to hire staff, due to pandemic uncertainty and fewer candidates from the EU. And that drove starting salaries rose last month, at the fastest rate since September 2018 -- in a boost to workers. Shoesmith said: ‚ÄúWith demand spiking, the skills and labour shortages that already existed in the UK have come into sharper focus ‚Äì and COVID has only made them worse.‚Äù AJ Bell financial analyst Danni Hewson says the UK‚Äôs new tighter travel restrictions are causing ‚Äòaftershocks‚Äô in the travel sector today: ‚ÄúThe travel sector continued to see aftershocks from yesterday‚Äôs earthquake decision to remove Portugal from the green list of travel destinations from the UK. Hopes of anything approaching a normal summer for the industry now look pretty much over. ‚ÄúDomestically the hospitality sector will be hoping that a full reopening is still on the cards for the 21 June but creeping concern about the threat posed by the Delta variant may send any decision on this to the wire ‚Äì which is clearly exceptionally unhelpful for businesses.‚Äù Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Travel stocks are sliding this morning after the UK government removed Portugal from the ‚Äúgreen list‚Äù of countries exempt from significant travel restrictions, The decision to move Portugal to the amber list is a major blow to the airline sector - just weeks after the UK lifted restrictions on international flights. It has prompted warnings of a deepening crisis for aviation, with unions urging the ministers to provide more support. The move was bitterly criticised by the tourism industry, which had been hoping for more countries to be added to the ‚Äògreen list‚Äô, meaning passengers wouldn‚Äôt need to quarantine on their return. So the news that Portugal will moved to Amber on June 8th, while seven countries, including Egypt and Sri Lanka, are now on the ‚Äúred list‚Äù of destinations that require hotel quarantine, has jolted the sector. Jet engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce, whose engine servicing business is dependent on planes racking up flying hours, are down almost 2.5% this morning, the biggest faller on the blue-chip FTSE 100. Shares in British Airways-owner IAG have dropped another 1.5% in early trading, adding to their 5% slide on Thursday as the Portugal news emerged. Travel stocks are also among the fallers on the FTSE 250 index, with budget airline easyJet dropping by 1.5% (it also fell 5% yesterday). Wizz Air, which warned this week that it would make another loss unless restrictions were eased, are down 2.5%. In Dublin, Ryanair have dropped another 1%. The move has also hit the cruise sector, where Carnival are down 2%. Yesterday‚Äôs selloff wiped around ¬£2bn off travel stocks, as the prospect of revenues from Portugal trips faded. Transport secretary Grant Shapps blamed concerns of a new coronavirus mutation and rising cases for the move; although Portugal called the decision ‚Äòunfathomable‚Äô. Airlines hit out at the plan, with EasyJet‚Äôs boss, Johan Lundgren, saying: ‚ÄúThe government has torn up its own rulebook and ignored the science, throwing people‚Äôs plans into chaos, with virtually no notice or alternative options for travel from the UK. This decision essentially cuts the UK off from the rest of the world.‚Äù Unions are also concerned about the move, with prospect general secretary Mike Clancy warning that the industry risks losing ‚Äòhalf of the summer‚Äô. ‚ÄúThis news today is further evidence of the instability facing the aviation industry this summer. With government advice shifting regularly it is imperative that proper financial support for the sector is put in place. ‚ÄúEven in the most optimistic scenario, we now face losing half of the summer before holidaymakers can confidently book travel to major destinations, and the nearer we get to the school holidays the more likely they will be to just stay at home. Given the uncertainty, Clancy adds, the government must consider doing more to help the sector - or risk seeing travel firms collapse - pushing up unemployment. ‚ÄúThe government starts phasing out its lifeline furlough scheme in four weeks‚Äô time which is only adding to the damaging uncertainty facing aviation. Ministers need to make clear that further support will be available to support jobs while restrictions on tourist travel remain in place. Without this, there‚Äôs a risk that the industry will no longer be there when restrictions are lifted.‚Äù Also coming up today Investors are bracing for the latest US jobs report, the Non-Farm Payroll, which will show whether hiring in America recovered in May after slowing in April. Economists predict around 650,000 new hires last month, up from 266,000. A jump in employment would clearly be very welcome, as the US economy is still missing eight million jobs since the pandemic. But a stronger-than-expected NFP could also jolt the markets, intensifying concerns about inflation- and the possibility that central bankers end their stimulus programmes. Ricardo Evangelista, senior analyst at ActivTrades, explains: The narrative in the markets has been dominated by the risk of high inflation becoming a collateral effect of the ongoing gargantuan stimulus. The Fed has, so far, refused to blink, insisting that any spikes in prices are likely to be temporary and that bringing forward the tapering could damage the economic recovery. Amidst this tug-of-war, employment is likely to become a decisive factor, with a high reading having the potential to force the Fed to start thinking about tapering its current monetary and asset purchase policies. Looking at today‚Äôs dollar gains, it appears that many investors are already positioning themselves for such a scenario. G7 finance ministers are meeting in the UK for two days of talks, where they will try to hammer out a landmark deal to end tax avoidance by multinationals and big technology companies using tax havens to exploit loopholes in the global system. The UK and Norway are close to signing a trade deal, with a formal announcement expected as soon as today. UK sources have told City AM that the deal could could cut Norwegian tariffs on British agricultural exports, like beef and cheese, and provide more access to Norwegian fish imports to the UK.

On Friday the theatre announced reopening plans which will include a new musical based on Sleeping Beauty; and a new play for the Olivier stage telling the story of Nathuram Godse, the devout follower of Gandhi who became his assassin in 1948. It also publicly launched National Theatre Together, described by the NT‚Äôs artistic director, Rufus Norris, as ‚Äúa campaign that seeks to ensure we emerge from this time into a bright and creative future‚Äù. Norris said the theatre‚Äôs new work department was returning to full strength ‚Äúand we are even more committed to opening our doors to artists and theatre makers from across the whole breadth of the UK to support the sector, to flourish after the devastation of the past year‚Äù. That will include a commitment that at least a third of the department‚Äôs capacity and resources will go towards developing work produced outside London. All three South Bank theatre spaces are beginning to reopen for live audiences for the first time since March 2020. The biggest space, the Olivier, reopens for socially distanced audiences in a fortnight with Under Milk Wood, starring Michael Sheen.

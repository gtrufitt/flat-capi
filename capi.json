In the tangerine corner, we have Blackpool FC. They are recovering from 32 years of ever increasing misery under the revolting ownership of Owen Oyston.

Michael Appleton warmly congratulates Neil Critchley, who has done a glorious job since joining from Liverpool. Blackpool thoroughly deserved their victory. They got off to a shambolic start when Ollie Turton scored an own goal after 47 seconds. It took them 10 minutes to clear their heads, but from that moment on they played with calm certainty. Kenny Douglas scored two superb goals and Jerry Yates had a magnificent game up front. Lincoln didn’t have a shot on target, which is an odd thing to say in a match that finished 2-1; it also reflects Blackpool’s defensive excellence. Blackpool return to the Championship for the first time since 2015! The primal roar at the final whistle is euphoric confirmation of the club’s rebirth under the owner Simon Sadler and the manager Neil Critchley. The unlikely hero was the Australian midfielder Kenny Douglas, who rifled two superb goals, one with each foot, from just outside the area. 90+3 min: Great chance for Lincoln! Scully’s free-kick is blocked at the near post and cleared. Bridcutt launches it back towards the edge of the area, where a defensive header falls nicely for Poole. He controls the ball smartly but then sweeps a shot over the bar from 18 yards. That was a big chance. 90+2 min The corner is cleared but then Dougall fouls McGrandles 30 yards from goal on the right. He is booked. Palmer stays forward for the free-kick. 90+2 min A corner to Lincoln. The keeper Palmer comes forward... 90 min There will be four minutes of added time. 89 min Blackpool make the opposite change: the centre-back Jordan Thorniley replaces the outstanding Jerry Yates. 88 min Lincoln bring on the centre-back Lewis Montsma to play up front. Joe Walsh goes off. 88 min Scully finds Rogers in a bit of space 25 yards from goal. He turns and whips a curling shot towards the far corner, but it’s well off target. 87 min 49 games, 735 hours apiece: the whole season comes down to the next few minutes. 86 min Scully’s teasing cross hits a Blackpool defender on or near the arm at the far post. The ball bounces up and is punched away desperately by Maxwell, with the ball ricocheting to safety. 85 min Johnson teases a slow cross towards Morton, who gets between Turton and Ballard but heads over from six yards. It wasn’t the easiest chance - slightly too high, no pace on the ball - but it was the best opportunity Lincoln have had for a while. 84 min Husband is booked for pulling back Morton near the halfway line. 81 min Lincoln haven’t had a shot on target in the entire match. 80 min A half chance for Morton, who miscontrols Bridcutt’s long pass on the edge of the area. It wasn’t the easiest ball to take, especially as he was under pressure from Ballard, but had he done so he would have been through on goal. 80 min A change for Lincoln as well. Anthony Scully on, Jorge Grant off. 79 min There’s a break in play while Ballard receives treatment for cramp. Blackpool make a couple of substitutions: the fit again CJ Hamilton replaces Embleton, and Grant Ward comes on for the limping Keshi Anderson. 78 min The last man Bridcutt, on a yellow card, makes a terrific sliding challenge on Anderson. 76 min In an identical position at the other end, Bridcutt is penalised for shoving Madine this far outside the area. I’m not sure it was a foul, in truth. Garbutt hangs the free-kick up towards Madine, who loops a header onto the roof of the net. 75 min Replays show that Garbutt didn’t get the ball when he tackled Johnson in the 67th minute. I think the contact was just outside ethe area, though it was extremely close. 75 min Good pressure from Lincoln, with the teenager Morgan Rogers starting to look dangerous on the left wing. He wins a corner and then a couple of throw-ins near the corner flag. 72 min: Poole clears off the line! Dougall, surrounded by Lincoln players, stabbed a short pass towards Madine just inside the penalty area. He let it run cleverly to Yates, who dinked the ball over the outrushing Palmer. I think it was going wide, but Poole made sure by booting it clear. 70 min “Could Dougall score Blackpool’s first Wembley hat-trick since that long-forgotten game in 1953?” says Lino Ruocco. “I jest of course, but also, has any team recovered so many times from being a goal down in the playoffs as Blackpool? Win or lose, they always show resilience, regardless of the era.” Even when the personnel are completely different, that kind of resilience has a happy habit of perpetuating itself. 69 min A change for Blackpool: Gary Madine replaces Demetri Mitchell, which suggests a switch to 4-4-2. 67 min Garbutt slides in on Johnson to concede another corner. Brennan Johnson has been Lincoln’s best attacker by a mile. Grant’s corner is headed away at the near post. 67 min Yates waits for Garbutt to run round the outside and finds him with a lovely pass. Garbutt tries to dance past Eyoma on the byline but runs the ball out of play. 65 min This is a good spell for Lincoln, their best since the first 10 minutes. Bridcutt is booked for taking out Anderson, and then berates the referee for not giving Lincoln a free-kick moments earlier for a challenge on Johnson. 64 min If it stays like this Kenny Dougall will take the headlines, and quite right too, but Jerry Yates has had an outstanding game up front for Blackpool. His pressing led to the first goal, and his unselfishness and precision were a key part of the second. 63 min Lincoln make their first change: Callum Morton is on for Tom Hopper. 61 min Lincoln have gone up a couple of gears since going behind. Johnson twists Garbutt one way and then the other in the area before his cross his cleared. He had a great chance to shoot when he first received the ball from Bridcutt, but instead decided to take Garbutt on. 59 min This game has demonstrated the potential perils of scoring too early. Johnson tries to Lincoln going again with a surging run that forces Ballard to concede a corner. Moments later he goes down in the area after a slight shove from Husband. There wasn’t enough force for a penalty. 57 min I think I’m right in saying that, before today, Kenny Dougall had scored two goals in his three seasons in English football. Both his goals were beautifully struck, one with each foot. Mitchell’s cross from the right took a slight deflection and ran through to Yates, 12 yards out with his back to goal. He thought about a shot, realised it wasn’t on and played a slow, inviting pass to Dougall on the edge of the D. This time he went with his right foot, drilling a daisy-cutter into the bottom-left corner. That was so sweetly struck. Kenny Dougall scores another superb goal! 50 min Embleton plays a slick one-two with Turton and wins a corner. It’s curled under the bar and punched away a little desperately by Palmer. Moments later, Stewart cracks a bouncing ball over the bar from distance. 48 min Ballard is booked for a foul on Rogers. 47 min The goalscorer Dougall slides a through ball towards Yates, but Walsh comes across to intercept. 46 min Peep peep! Blackpool begin the second half. Peep peep! It’s level at Wembley after a fascinating first half. Lincoln went ahead after 47 seconds through an own goal from Ollie Turton, but they became passive thereafter and allowed Blackpool into the game. They accepted the invitation with a fine equaliser from Kenny Dougall, though there was an unpunished handball by Elliot Embleton in the build up. Jorge Grant, who was at fault for the Blackpool goal, had earlier hit the crossbar with a fine effort. At the other end Blackpool had a number of shots on target, though all bar Dougall’s were straight at the keeper Palmer. 45 min Blackpool continue to press for a second goal. Neil Critchley will be thrilled with their calm, authoritative response to that abysmal start. 41 min Lincoln may need another half-time brollocking from Michael Appleton. They are hanging on a little bit now, and Palmer has to make another save when Mitchell meets Garbutt’s cross with a decent header. 40 min Embleton, who is looking increasingly dangerous, shoots straight at Palmer from 22 yards. 39 min Palmer will be annoyed that he was beaten at his near post, but it was a very clean strike from Dougall with his left foot. I think Palmer saw it late as well. He did get a hand on it but couldn’t keep it out. 37 min A Lincoln free-kick is half cleared to Edun, who sprays over from 25 yards. 36 min Lincoln had been asking for trouble, playing too passively after the first 10 minutes. I suppose it’s human nature to do that when you go ahead so early in such a vital game, but it’s not always the best policy. 35 min There’s no VAR in the play-offs. I think the goal would have been disallowed if VAR was in use, though it’s not certain. You could argue there was enough time between the accidental handball and Dougall’s goal to invalidate the offence. Yates stole the ball off Grant in the centre circle, moved forward and found Embleton on the edge of the area. He ran into trouble and lost the ball, but then Walsh’s clearance hit him on the hand and dropped at his feet, 20 yards from goal. He squared it to Dougall, who whistled a superb low past Palmer at the near post. Kenny Dougall equalises for Blackpool - and Lincoln are furious! 32 min “Afternoon Rob,” says Lee Smith. “Perhaps a confirmed Lancastrian such as Phil Sawyer (5th minute) should remain focused on the Roses drubbing currently being handed out to the White Rose fraternity. Either that or enjoy Brennan Johnson before he heads back to Nottingham!” Nottingham via Azerbaijan and Italy, I hope. 31 min Brennan Johnson, who has been quiet since that flying start, has started to see more of the ball in the last few minutes. I can’t wait to see him in the Championship with Forest next season. 27 min: Good save from Palmer! The ball ricochets kindly into the path of Yates on the left side of the area. His clever cutback just evades Husband and runs on to Mitchell, who sweeps a first-time shot towards goal with his left foot. It’s sweetly struck but too close to Palmer, who beats it away. 26 min At the other end, Embleton’s looping cross is headed over by the backpedalling Mitchell. It wasn’t much of a chance. 25 min: Grant hits the bar! Lincoln come so close to making it 2-0. Rogers zips infield from the left and plays a crisp pass into Grant, unmarked 20 yards from goal. He has time to turn and hit an extravagant curling shot that beats Maxwell and clatters off the top of the bar. 23 min Blackpool have had 88 per cent of the possession in the last five minutes. Most of it has been harmless, but it’s another sign that they have cleared their heads from the shock of that first-minute own-goal. 22 min “Any comments on the booing clearly heard on TV,” says Dave Stevens. “TV commentators ignored it.” When the players took a knee? I was typing something about it when Turton scored the own goal, and I got lost in that. But yes, it was audible. It’s hard to know what to say really. 21 min Free-kick to Blackpool, 25 yards from goal. Garbutt strikes it well but straight at Palmer. 18 min This is a good spell for Blackpool, who have pinned Lincoln back for the last five or six minutes. 16 min Ballard, in his own half, booms a long angled pass to Yates on the left side of the area. He feeds the underlapping Garbutt, whose cross is put behind for a corner by Johnson. This time Walsh heads clear. 15 min And now their first shot on target. Mitchell makes a promising run infield from the right but hits a weak effort straight at Palmer. 13 min Blackpool win their first corner, another sign they are getting into the game after that desperate. Garbutt swings it in, Hopper heads clear. 11 min Blackpool enjoy their first extended spell of possession. Eventually Husband drives a long pass towards Yates, who is just beaten to the ball by the alert keeper Alex Palmer. 9 min The resulting free-kick is curled to the near post, where Walsh heads over from six yards. That was a fairly decent chance; he couldn’t quite get over the ball. 9 min Garbutt is booked for clattering Johnson, the Welsh winger who has made a sensational start to the game. 6 min Brennan Johnson has made a superb start on the right wing. His low cross is put behind for Lincoln’s first corner. It’s curled towards the penalty spot and headed away by Husband. Never mind clearing with the head; Blackpool urgently need to clear their heads. 5 min “Afternoon, Rob,” says Phil Sawyer. “As The Only Blackpool Lad In Lincoln, I’m keeping my head down this afternoon. I’m stocked up on tangerines should a baying mob storm Sawyer Towers post-match, hungry for blood. If you never hear from me again, know that I fought to the last squirt of citric acid and stick of rock. Seasiders!” 3 min What a nightmare for Ollie Turton. His brain and body just weren’t in sync. He must have been distracted by Hopper and the keeper Maxwell missing the ball at the near post, because he was a bit slow to adjust his body position and that’s why the ball went into his own net rather than behind for a corner. Michael Appleton said his team had to come out of the traps, and by heaven they have. Johnson charged at the left-back Garbutt and fizzed a low cross into the six-yard box. It was missed by Hopper at the near post and turned into his own net by Ollie Turton! Lincoln are ahead after 47 seconds! 1 min Peep peep! Lincoln, in their black away strip, kick off from right to left. Blackpool are wearing tangerine. It’s a gorgeous day at Wembley, and the 10,000 fans in attendance are making a rousing noise. The players line up for the national anthem, and what a timeless cracker it is. With ten minutes to go until kick off, here’s a reminder of the teams. Blackpool (4-2-3-1) Maxwell; Turton, Ballard, Husband, Garbutt; Dougall, Stewart; Mitchell, Embleton, Anderson; Yates. Substitutes: Moore, Gabriel, Ekpiteta, Thornley, Ward, Hamilton, Madine. Lincoln (4-1-4-1) Palmer; Poole, Eyoma, Walsh, Edun; Bridcutt; Johnson, McGrandles, Grant, Rogers; Hopper. Substitutes: Long, Montsma, Sanders, Scully, Bramall, Morton, Anderson. Referee Tony Harrington. And here’s the Lincoln manager Michael Appleton “[On their delayed arrival] Hopefully it won’t affect us too much. These things can happen with London traffic - I think there was a big accident and one of the roads was shut. Listen, the lads will be ready by 3 o’clock. “We’ve got to come out of the traps - we know Blackpool will start fast and we need to compete with them. The longer the game goes on and stays close, that’s when we start to back ourselves. We always tend to finish strongly. But we know Blackpool are very organised, efficient and hard to beat.” The thoughts of Blackpool manager Neil Critchley “I really feel for the kid [Ellis Simms]. It was basically the last kick of the training session yesterday - he took a penalty and felt something go. It’s heartbreaking. He was going to start today, so for that to be taken away in such cruel circumstances is a body blow for us and even more so for him. “We’ve had key players out all season. We’re adaptable and flexible in our thinking, and we’re ready - we’re good to go. We’ve had a good rest since the semi-final. Other than the heat [it’s around 20 degrees], we’ll be fine!” Lincoln didn’t arrive at Wembley until 2.15pm, according to David Prutton on Sky Sports. I can’t speak for the Lincoln players but I would hate that. I panic if I’m not in the MBM dungeon an hour before kick-off, so I’d be all over the show if I was a player. Blackpool had a fairly comfortable passage to Wembley, beating Oxford 6-3 on aggregate in their semi-final. Lincoln’s progress was much more dramatic. They recovered from a desperate first half at the Stadium of Light last Saturday to eliminate Sunderland in memorable style. Pre-match reading A blow for Blackpool: the in-form Ellis Simms, on loan from Everton, picked up a knock in training and doesn’t even make the bench. Conor McGrandles, an influential substitute in Lincoln’s semi-final win over Sunderland, starts in place of Anthony Scully. There are umpteen things that make the play-offs so compelling, even for the neutral. They provide agony and ecstasy, to use the most popular cliché, but also drama, controversy, desperation and occasionally the highest farce. Most of all, they give us brilliant, sometimes legendary stories. And in today’s League One play-off final at Wembley, we are guaranteed a feelgood belter of a tale. In the black corner, we have Lincoln City. If they are promoted, they will play in the second tier for the first time since 1961, and continue the spectacular rise of a club that was in the National League as recently as 2017. In the tangerine corner, we have Blackpool FC. They are recovering from 32 years of ever increasing misery under the revolting ownership of Owen Oyston. He was finally removed a cojple of years ago, and Blackpool’s storming run into the play-offs - they were 15th at the end of January - has enhanced the feeling of a club reborn. There’s plenty of neutral goodwill towards both clubs and their impressive young coaches, Neil Critchley at Blackpool and Michael Appleton at Lincoln. The only shame is that they can’t both be promoted.

He beat Federer recently and I’m sure he treasures that, but to beat someone as good as Thiem, at the peak of his powers and on his preferred service, it amazing.

Andujar punishes a forehand, Thiem can’t respond, and he collapses onto the ground, aggravating some cramp in the process. Amazing! He’s 35 years-old and had never won from two sets down before. But he did a brilliant job here, clinching victory with a nerveless and mass-murderous forehand. He beat Federer recently and I’m sure he treasures that, but to beat someone as good as Thiem, at the peak of his powers and on his preferred service, it amazing. He meets Delbonis or Albot next. A terrific backhand, inside out from the centre of the baseline and into the corner, is too good, and Andujar has two match points! Thiem lays a drop to yank Andujar into the net, but he shows superb hands to flick over a winner for 15-all, then holds it down for 30-15. Here we go... A seventh double at 30-0 invites Andujar into the game, so Thiem finds a monster that’s returned into the net ... and another. Andujar will have to serve for it; good luck, mate. A love-hold for Thiem keeps him in the hunt but Andujar responds perfectly, racing to 30-0 then running down a forehand; it hands Thiem a simple put-away, though, and from close to the net he hammers down the line again ... but Andujar reads it, picking the right side and blazing a winner cross-court! That’s superbly done, and shortly afterwards he’s a game away! Andujar 4-6 5-7 6-3 6-4 5-3 Thiem That wasn’t an easy game for the number three seed, who looked set to win on various occasions before she actually did. Still, she’s into round two and will play Parry or Sasnovich next. Thiem is struggling with balance here, trying to attack missing a couple, then trying to defend, missing a couple, and round and round. Addujar doesn’t need asking twice, holding to love, and is just two games away! Andujar 4-6 5-7 6-3 6-4 4-2 Thiem Right, here we go! Andujar quickly gets himself 0-40 – there’ve been 34 break points in the match! – and Thiem saves the first in this game with a booming serve. But he can’t repeat the trick and Andujar climbs into his second, a forehand winner topspun cross-court, to break for the second time in the decider! Might that be the telling blow? Andujar 4-6 5-7 6-3 6-4 3-2 Thiem Andujar is struggling now Thiem has got through his mid-match crisis and has to save a break point in order to make deuce. But two wild swings from a nauseated Belgian shove him through that and this is very, very tense now. Andujar 4-6 5-7 6-3 6-4 2-2 Thiem Sabalenka is on the charge and now leads Konjuh 5-2 and by one set to love. She’s nearly done and is looking confident out there; maybe it’s now she gets beyond round four for the first time in a major. I hope so, because I love watching her work. A comfortable hold from Thiem underlines the momentum shift and gives him 2-1 in the decider; can Andujar respond? On Lenglen, Konjuh has broken back, so trails Sabalenka 4-6 2-3. Andujar gets low to spirit a backhand winner down the line, his 11th of the match, but a forehand from Thiem, whipped cross-court, makes it 40-30. Pressure. And it tells, Thiem finding something to hang in the next rally; it ends when Andujar goes long, the next when Thiem absolutely mass-murders a backhand cross-court for break-back point. He can’t take it but make no mistake, he’s back into this, earning another with a bodacious overhead. AND HAVE A LOOK! Andujar wrongfoots him, so he draws back for his forehand then realising he can’t play it, brings the racket around his back and his opponent nets! People are something aren’t they? A few minutes ago, Thiem was totally bedraggled, now he’s the better player! Andujar 4-6 5-7 6-3 6-4 1-1 Thiem “Could it be that Andujar is playing the match of his life at 35?” returns Jacques Derek Charlwood. “Way to go!” Believe! As it goes, he’s not played that well, but Thiem has collapsed in very peculiar fashion. Hello! Andujar gets to 0-40 on the Thiem serve and then Thiem tosses one so far wide you can’t believe he tries to hit it! The serve dumps into the net, but his second go wins the point ... but then he nets a backhand! Where has Dominic Thiem gone! Five holds from Andujar and he’s won his first-ever match from two sets down! Andujar 4-6 5-7 6-3 6-4 1-0 Thiem Ah, and Saba has just broken to lead 2-0 in set two. She may just have broken the back of Konjuh. On Lenglen, Sabalenka, the women’s number three seed, has just taken a tight first set off Konjuh 6-4. I was watching Nishikori on my second screen but have just switched to this one so will have a look at how it’s going. Elsewhere, Dimitrov is nearly there, 4-1 up on Giron in set three, while while Nishikori has won set three and now leads Giannessi 2-1. Yeah, Andujar is nervous and quickly faces break-back point ... so carts an ace down the T! That is superb behaviour! Thiem then goes long with a return and Andujar has another set point! He’ll need to do it with a second serve too, and Thiem looks primed ... to cloud an inside-out forehand wide! We’ve go waselves a decider! Andujar 4-6 5-7 6-3 6-4 Thiem How are your nerves, Pablo Andujar? When his first serve goes in he’s winning 60 percent of points and he finds one first up, but soon has to claw his way back to 30-all. Then Thiem sends a return long and it’s set point ... but Andujar, behind in the next rally, tries a lob, which Thiem punishes. Deuce it is.... Thiem rinses through a hold, forcing Andujar to serve for it. Hang on, mates! Andujar 4-6 5-7 6-3 5-4 Thiem Andujar gets himself to 40-0 but then Thiem manages to get to within a point and tries a drop ... Andujar reads and takes control of the rally, then a shot later, a leaping backhand, flicked along the net, gives him 5-3! I wonder where we’ll go from here. The tournament organisers asked her to reconsider and tried to check on her well-being, but no conversation happened. Thiem is back into this, yanking back a break then saving a break point before holding; he’s within a game of Andujar, and it feels like momentum is switching. It’s 4-3 in the third now, with Thiem leading by two sets to one. A quick once-over the other courts shows me that Nishikori is a break up on Gianessi, who levelled the match at 1-1 just a bit ago, whie Dimitrov leads Giron 6-2 6-4. I’d love to see old Grigzy do something, but at 30 his time to win a major has probably gone. In fairness, it must be pretty nauseating to still have the players you were meant to succeed winning stuff. “Andujar is indeed playing well,” says Jacques Derek Charlwood, “but puffing his cheeks with every point. One wonders if as you get older ( he is 35 versus Thiem’s 24) you regulate your first serves to save energy.” I’m sure you do lots to keep yourself fresh, but I’d wager that there’s nothing better for that than the game flowing with you - as it is now for Andujar. Andujar, who looks not unlike Mikel Arteta, is really piecing Thiem up here, covering his angles and picking his drops. In this latest game, he reads a forehand to this backhand corner, skids after it and carts a winner cross-court! Eventually, we get to deuce and Andujar raises break point; Thiem really needs a first serve, can’t find one, and then from the backhand corner, looks down the line and slashes wide! It looks a lot like we’ll get a deciderhere, and the number four seed is in shtuck! Andujar 4-6 5-7 6-3 4-1 Thiem Three games in row for Andujar, who’s seeing it very nicely right about now. He carts a forehand pass cross-court, and that’s 3-1 to him, Thiem by two sets to one. “Dropping our Hs would give us Enman and Ewitt, Enin, Ingiss and Antuchova,” notes Andrew Benton. “Even with their Hs restored, they’re all azbeens. Are there no H’s playing at top table these days?” I guess not, though I do laugh every time I hear someone call Hazza Kane or Maguire “Haitch.” I guess there’s this lad though. On court 14, Gianessi has won a breaker to four, levelling his match with Nishikori at one set all; on court seven, Dimitrov took the first set against Giron and we’re 3-3 in the second. So what’s going on on Chatrier?! Thiem swipes a forehand wide and Andujar, who’s playing really well now, is a break up in set four! Elsewhere, Fucsovics is serving for the match against Simon and Dimitrov is a set up on Giron. That was a really enjoyable match, and you’ve got to admire Kecmanovic’s role in it. It’s been a tricky few years for him, but he was a very good junior and at 21 still has time to grow. But now it’s over! Kecmanovic reads a second serve and punches back a winner, then Evans goes long on a desperate and high forehand volley! Kecmanovic plays Moutet or Djere next; Evans, meanwhile, is imropving but has now gone out in round 1 in three of the last four majors. Good Evans. Again, his serve is dicey and from in front, he finds himself facing match point at 30-40; a gigantic forehand elicits an error, then an ace takes advantage to give him advantage. Kecmanovic, though, plays a terrific point – in fairness, both players do – swapping forehands and gets before a drop-shot brings us back to deuce. This is great stuff. Why have they changed the service marker on the telly scoreboard from a dot to a new paragraph mark? Kecmanovic has tightened, and flings a forehand long to give Evans 30-all before netting a backhand! And when Evans finds a deep return, he goes long! That’s four straight points for the British number 1, and he’s still in this! Kecmanovic 1-6 6-3 6-3 5-4 Evans Kecmanovic will now serve for the match, a circumstance that did not look likely when he lost the first set 6-1. Now then! Andujar struggles back and holds to take the third set! Thiem was a bit lax there, and as punishment he’ll have to charge about for a bit longer. Andujar 4-6 5-7 6-3 Thiem Kecmanovic has only won nine matches so far this season, but he’s found his form now and a comfortable enough consolidation means that Evans will now serve to stay in the match at 2-5 in the fourth. Now then. Andujar breaks Thiem to love and is now serving for the third set ... and is 0-30 down. It takes a while, but Kecmanovic wins his third game in a row and now needs only two more for the win. Evans had loads of chances to level the set but couldn’t strong two points together once he’d won three to come back from 0-40. Kecmanovic 1-6 6-3 6-3 4-2 Evans She plays Vesnina or Govortsova next. Superb from Evans, roaring back from 0-40 to win three straight points, the last of them an ace – his first of the set. He then hands Kecmanovic a chance by cracking into the net-cord, but the consequent pass is no good and we recline into a round of deuces. Brutal. Credit to Andujar, he’s not going away. He leads 3-2 in set three while, back in the women’s competition, Kvitova has bolted and leads Minnen 4-0 in the decider. Ach! Evans played his better stuff for a while but Kecmanovic is coming again, breaking back before speeding through a love hold! We’re back on serve in set four. Kecmanovic 1-6 6-3 6-3 3-2 Evans As such, here’s a piece on the unique joy of Murray, and here he is in Joy of Six: cool sports stats. Email! “I know it shouldn’t matter,” writes Simon McMahon, “but for me tennis just hasn’t been the same without Andy Murray. I know Evans, Edmund, Konta and Norrie are still carrying the flag for GB tennis, and it seems Dan is channeling his inner Andy today, but my wish is that we can see Andy himself win a few more matches at Grand Slams before retirement, maybe making the second week at Wimbledon with a signature Murray performance, battling back from two sets down, having to beat himself as much as his opponent, full of fist pumps, emotion, drama and of course some sublime shot-making. He’s earned the right to go out on his own terms I think. I don’t think we’ve ever taken him for granted, but it could be a long time before we see his like again. Scotland’s greatest ever sportsperson? I’d say he’s in the top one.” I feel you – I can’t think of many individual sportsfolk I’ve loved as much as Murray, who is one of the most obviously top blokes I’ve never met. I can’t think of many Scots anywhere near him – Alan Wells is one, Law, Dalglish and Rose Reilly others. I’ve got a personal soft spot for Jojo Calderwood, but yeah, I’d have Muzz, for the martchplaying but also for the man. Evans is breathing hard - it’s warm out there - as he works his arse off for the second break. He gets a chance too, but Kecmanovic finds a first serve-forehand combo that removes the opportunity, and following a further succession of deuces, closes out the game to get on the board in set three. Kecmanovic 1-6 6-3 6-3 0-2 Evans On Lenglen, Kvitova has taken the breaker so she and Minnen – a Belgian qualifier – will play a decider. Minnen 7-6(3) (5)5-7 Kvitova Evans shanks a return that gives Kecmanovic deuce and naturally abuses the court with some choice Anglo-Saxon; quite right too. He’s struggling to get free points on his serve here, but he’s fighting like Chelsea and Man City fans in Oporto. Eventually, it pays off too, a second serve out wide cleaned up with a ferocious forehand. This is a really fun match now. Kecmanovic 1-6 6-3 6-3 0-2 Evans Elsewhere, Minnen leads Kvitova, the number 11 seed, 7-6; they’re playing a breaker in set two. Fucsovics, meanwhile, leads Simon 6-4 6-1 and Pella is sorting Galan 6-3 7-6(4). Thiem closes out the second set, and now leads Andujar 6-4 7-5. Evans changes from blue to green, which should sort things ... and, for now, it has! He glides a backhand return cross-court and when Kecmanovic’s riposte clips the net cord, he shovels a winner into the corner. If these two can hit a vein at the same time, the conclusion of this match could be great. Kecmanovic 1-6 6-3 6-3 0-1 Evans Less surprising is what happens on Chatrier, Thiem turning it up to break to love. He’ll now serve for the set (again). This is superb from Kecmanovic! Just as Evans thinks he found himself again, he’s broken again, and that’s 2-1 to the Serb! Kecmanovic 1-6 6-3 6-3 Evans Well who saw that coming? From 30-0 up, Thiem allows Andujar back into the game and it costs him a break! We’re back on serve in set two! Andujar 4-6 5-5 Thiem Excellent from Evans, coming in behind a telling forehand to despatch a high backhand volley at the net; that gives him two break points, and a wild, swiped backhand keeps the set alive. Kecmanovic 1-6 6-3 5-3 Evans Meanwhile, on Chatrier, Thiem is serving for 2-0; Andujar has never won a match from 0-2 down. He gets there in the end! Kecmanovic is splattering Evans’ serve at the moment, and after change of ends, he’ll rely on his own to go 2-1 in front. Kecmanovic 1-6 6-3 5-2 Evans Thanks John. Evans and Kecmanovic are wrestling through a brutal game that Evans must win; the longer it goes, the more that is so. Kecmanovic has the latest of various advantages ... and Evans saves break point number seven with a large forehand and put-away. And with that, it’s back to Daniel with Evans v Kecmanovic so finely poised. It’s a tad windy in Paris, and Evans continues to put up a fight against Kecmanovic’s serve. He has a break point at deuce but crashes his shot into the net. Then he lands another with a smash. He can’t keep the ball in on the next one so back to deuce it goes. Then comes another, and Evans continues to chat to himself. Then comes a huge rally, and Evans slowly moves his opponent around the court to break back to 2-4. Now he must serve this one out. Kecmanovic breaks straight back, unaffected by Evans’ mini-revival, he’s 4-1 on up on the Brit and looks assured of the third set. Evans is still living, and he breaks back, charging from the back of the court to leather a winner. It’s still 1-3 in the third but he has hope. His problem is that he is having to do most of his playing from the very back of the court. Going with serve between Thiem and Andujar on Philippe Chatrier. It’s a most even contest. There’s a Serbian contingent roaring on Kecmanovic, but nobody roaring on Dan Evans the plucky Brit. He’s still doing plenty of talking to himself. And more rude words. He’s down 3-0 and in deep trouble. Kecmanovic serves out to get 2-0 up and now Evans is swearing at the umpire, complaining that people are being let into the court while he is serving. He used the f-word. Naughty boy, and he’s getting a spanking here. Dan Evans throwing a wobbler? He is interrupted by a voice from outside the court as he goes to serve, catches the ball. “Astonishing, mate, astonishing,” he shouts at persons unknown. And Kecmanovic has a run on him, breaking in the very first game of the third set. Some big names playing in tonight’s inaugural evening session. Thiem serves out, and wins the first set 6-4, walloping a forehand winner. Kecmanovic lands himself three set points with some excellent play, and eventually serves to love. 1-6 6-3 now, and Evans has trouble on his hands. Kecmanovic, at 5-2 up, attempts to break Evans but the Englishman forces him to serve to level the sets. Evans double faults and leads 40-30, only to win the game with a great forehand. Thiem has control of the first set against Andujar as he goes 5-3 up. His opponent seems flustered; his good play is going unrewarded. He holds the next one and lands his first ace in the process. Thiem will serve out the set. Some resistance from Evans, real speed around the court as he tries to stop Kecmanovic breaking again, and he holds to take it back 2-4 in the second set. A Tim Henman-style punch of the air, but without the blowing on the fingers. Some actualité. It goes 4-1 to Kecmanovic with a good hold of serve. Evans needs to start picking things back up or he will be in trouble in the third set, too. Hello there, here for the next hour. Andujar just saved six break points from Thiem, and it’s 2-3 to the Frenchman. Evans just got one back, so it’s 1-3 in the second set with Kecmanovic. Right, I’m away for some fress. John Brewin with narrate you through the next little bit. Kecmanovic is reading Evans now, chasing down his drops and generally dominating – this is boiling up nicely. Kecmanovic 1-6 3-0 Evans Thiem is such a beautiful mover, and already Andujar is puffing out his cheeks in resignation. But 1-3 and break point down, he runs around a forehand to drive a winner down the line; this game has been going nearly six minutes now, the majority of it Andujar saving break points, and we’ve now been going 11 minutes. Andujar 1-3 Thiem Superb from Kecmanovic, who holds then reads an Evans drop for 0-30 before, on break point, swiping a backhand winner cross-court! Do we got ourselves a ball-game? Kecmanovic 1-6 2-0 Evans Kecmanovic is making a game of the games now, but he’s still getting absolutely served; Evans, who beat Djokovic at Monte Carlo last month, is looking lovely and takes the first set in short order. Kecmanovic 1-6 Evans Back on Chatrier, Andujar had a break-back point against Thiem but failed to convert; he’s on the baord, though, 2-1 down in set one. Kecmanovic fights hard in the sixth game of the match and he’s in it now, a banging forehand down the line resolving a succession of deuces. Kecmanovic 1-5 Evans On court seven, Roberto Bautista Agut – the number 11 seed – is underway. If he’d played in the 80s or 90s he might’ve won one of these in the way that Muster, Bruguera, Gomez, Moya and Kafelnikov all did. But here we are. He trials Vilella Martinez 4-3 on serve. Meanwhile, on Chatrier, a dominant first game from Thiem sees him break Andujar. Evans has got into stride quickly here and looks to have Kecmanovic’s number. There’s not much pop on the Serb’s serve which is allowing yerman to climb right into points, and this first set is almost over. Kecmanovic 0-4 Evans Fognini has beaten Barrera 4,1 and 4. The number 27 seed plays Simon or, more likely, Fucsovics next. Those two tussle on Mathieu presently; Kovinivic has done for Burel 6-3 7-6(8) and must now contemplate Osaka. Anyhow, while I was busy wondering what my girlfriend wife would say if I publicly challenged her ability to have it, Evans was busy holding and breaking. Kecmanovic 0-2 Evans Just last week, Thiem noted that living in a bubble has helped Evans, given he’s previously struggled with the demands of the professional athlete’s lifestyle; Evans was having none of it, retorting that he’d sorted himself well before the pandemic started. “I must be out partying a lot, yeah,” he said. “I’ve done all right outside of the bubble as well. I must have improved a lot inside it for him to say that. I travel with my girlfriend every week. It’s not like you can go out partying with your girlfriend every week. It’s not that I was on my own and single and going nuts when there weren’t bubbles. It’s a strange comment, isn’t it?” Evans and Kecmanovic are knocking up.... Next on Chatrier: the number four seed and defeated finalist in 2018 and 2019, Dominic Thiem, begins his next assault on the trophy. He meets Pablo Andujar. A couple more results: in the men’s competition, Carreno Busta has rinsed Gombos 3,4, and 3, whole in the women’s, Tomljanovic has sorted Kozlova 2 and 4. Osaka hasn’t played a lot lately but she looked pretty good today. I don’t think her footwork is good enough to win here – yet – but her ball-striking was on-point and the relative closeness of the match is down to how well Tig played. Osaka meets Bogdan next. Osaka hollers a come on as she makes 4-2 in the breaker – the ball makes such a lush thump off the middle of her forehand. An error from Tig quickly gives her 5-2 ... but consecutive unforced errors and we’re back on serve. Briefly. Here ceom two more match points.... Next on court six, we’ve got Dan Evans, the British number one, against Minomir Kecmanovic. She meets Burel or Kovinivic next; Kovinivic won the first set 6-3 and it’s 2-2 in the second. Tig is competing hard here, but with a point for a breaker clips over another second serve of questionable power and Osaka quickly punishes. She may well regret that ... but no! A forehand clattered down the line saves the match point that follows, and a fine kicker helps her raise advantage, ceded when an inside-out forehand drops marginally wide ... but what a lob she finds when in front the next time! Tig 4-6 6-6 Osaka Fognini has taken that second set against Barrere to lead 6-4 6-1 1-0 (with a break). On court six, Badosa and Davis are playing a breaker in a topsy-turvy second set; Badosa won the first. But look at Kalinina! She reels off two points in short order and it turns out you can’t loz the first five games of a set and expect to win. She meets Collins or Wang next; Wang has just levelled the match at one set all. ...and Kerber saves it with a glorious backhand slice drop-shot! Egalité! Osaka is whacking it hard now, but Tig is just about sticking with her, while Kalinina finds a devastating forehand to give herself 30-0 against Kerber; she’s nearly there. Back to Chatrier, Tig misses a huge chance with a half-court volley that would’ve got her 15-30; seconds later, the game has gone and Osaka, 5-4 up in the second, needs just one more. Kerber, meanwhile, soon makes 30-all; Kalinina steps on the spot to try and shake her tightness, then serves a double. Eesh. She makes deuce though, then hits through the ball beautifully to raise match point... Fognini is bolting; the number 27 seed came from behind to take the first set of Barrere, but now leads 4-1 in the second. A monstrous forehand down the line breaks Kalinina to 15; it’s taken a while but Kerber is motoring. Still, the qualifier will have one more chance to eject her before we’re back on serve – but first, Kerber must hold. Kalinina 6-2 5-3 Kerber Tig is hanging in there well, but Osaka holds for 3-2, while Kerber has won a second game and Kalinina will now serve for the match a second time. At change of ends, she puts a towel over her head to get into the correct frame of mind. Pablo Carreno Busta, the number 12 seed and a clay-court specialist, has taken set two against Norbert Gombos; he now leads 6-3 6-4 0-1. Kerber has won a game! Kalinina now leads 6-2 5-1. Some reading on Edberg. Goodness me, Tig just dispensed the weakest second serve I’ve ever seen, short, skipping up off the clay, and duly marmalised by Osaka. In commentary, they reckon Sampras had the best second-serve in men’s history – shout from me for Edberg’s kicker – and Durie mentions Barty in the women’s game. Anyhow, Tig survives a break point to hold. Tig 4-6 2-2 It took a while, but Fognini has fought back to take the first set from Barrere, 6-4; Kalinina now leads Kerber – who’s won every major but this one – 6-2 4-0. Tossing those opportunities has not not gone down well with Osaka, who powers through a break to love, seizing the first set and sealing it with a colossal forehand racing forward. Tig 4-6 Osaka Updates from the women’s side: Kozlova 2-6 Tomljanovic, Cocciaretto 1-6 2-3 Bogdan, Collins 6-2 1-1 Wang Have a look! Kalinina breaks Kerber in the first game of the second set and quickly consolidates, while a double fault helps Tig earn a break-back point; Osaka impatiently whips a forehand long, and we’re back on serve! Tig 4-5 Osaka Tig saves three set points, forcing Osaka to serve for the first set, while Badosa has taken hers against Davis, 6-2. When they’re done on court six, Dan Evans will have a go; he plays the Serb, Miomir Kecmanović. Kerber couldn’t do enough, and after a succession of deuces during which she saved a set point with a net cord, Kalinina comes through 6-2. Carreno Busta, the number 12 seed, has rinsed through the first set against Gombos 6-3 and now trails 0-1 in the second, on serve; I’m not quite sure how they’ve managed 10 games so quickly, but they have. By way of comparison, Barrere leads Fognini 3-2, still with the break he took early doors. Osaka isn’t a natural mover on clay but she’s hitting it very nicely indeed, especially with feet planted. She’s won 15 out of 16 on serve, and her second straight love-game leaves her close to the first set. Tig 2-5 Osaka Yeah, time’s up. Kerber has roused herself to claw back a break. It might not save this set for her, but if she maintains her current level, she’ll be reet. Kalinina 5-2 Kerber Out of the corner of my eye, I’m also watching Paula Badosa, the number 33 seed, playing Lauren Davis; Badosa is a Manhattan-born Spaniard and won the girls’ singles in 2015. She’s looking good out there, leading 4-2. Elsewhere, Bogdan has taken the first set against Cocciaretto, 6-1; Fognini is a break down to Barrere; and Tomljanovic leads Kozlova 3-0. It’s all going wrong for Kerber, who now trails Kalinina 5-0. Under an umbrella – what a lovely sight that is – she takes some deep breaths while having a serious word with herself. Yeah, Osaka is grooving, greeting a decent first serve with a belter of a cross-court return to raise break point. But Tig yanks her in and Osaka stutter-slides in to botch a slice of her own ... but no matter. She’s piecing Tig up here, and a booming forehand nails her fourth advantage. Tig 0-2 Osaka I’m also watching Angelique Kerber, who’s not a great clay artist and is 0-2 down to Anhelina Kalinina, the qualifer. Meanwhile, on Chatrier, Jo Durie discusses how brilliant the current standard of women’s tennis is, and she’s right. I suppose I might slightly disagree, she’ll be devo’d to learn, because there’s no dominant champion at the peak of their powers. Perhaps Osaka will be become that, but otherwise there are so many who are so good, and when you stick on a match you’ve not a clue what’s going to happen, and that’s a beautiful thing. I’m really looking forward to seeing the improvements Osaka has made on clay, and she saves a break point in the opening game of the match. Tig 0-1 Osaka. On Chatrier, Naomi Osaka will be underway in une minute. Here’s Tumaini Carayol on her big call. Well, on the show courts - there’s plenty else besides. Chatrier Tig v Osaka [2] Andujar v Thiem [4] Azarenka [15] v Kuznetsova Tsitsipas [5] v Chardy Lenglen Fognini [27] v Barrere Minnen [Q] v Kvitova [11] Konjuh [Q] v Sabalneka [3] Zverev [6] v Otte [Q] Mathieu Burel v Kovinivic Fucsovics v Simon Moutet v Djere Dodin v Keys [23] It’s been an enervating, affirming winter slog, but we made it, and with the first ball tossed this morning, the summer of sport – the ridiculous summer of sport – is upon us. And you can be absolutely certain that we’ll take it. Most importantly, each of the show courts will house up to 1000 fans a day for each of the first 10 days – and hopefully more thereafter. They, like the rest of us, will be wondering whether this, finally, is the year that Rafael Nadal finally runs out of road; Novak Djokovic, Dominic Thiem, Stefanos Tsitsipas and Daniil Medvedev will be hoping so, but it will only be a hope. Meanwhile and as has become the fashion – sorry, le mode – no one has a clue what’ll happen in the women’s side. Iga Swiatek is the defending champion and if she hits a vein she’ll be hard to stop, but there are just so many others who might do likewise that anyone who thinks they know is lying. I cannot wait.

Out it fizzed, and Adam Lyth guided the ball off his hip and into the waiting hands of Luke Wells at leg slip. The first “Oh Lanky Lanky” since 2019 trilled over Old Trafford as Lyth stalked towards the dressing room.</p> <p>Seven overs later, the penultimate of the day, Saqib Mahmood hurtled in off his long, long run and pinned Tom Kohler-Cadmore in front of the stumps. Mahmood punched the air while Kohler-Cadmore slumped back off, followed shortly afterwards by a clatter that sounded very much like a bat being thumped repeatedly against a wall.</p> <p>Their frustration was understandable: Kohler-Cadmore and Lyth had batted for 38 of the 47 overs <strong>Yorkshire </strong>had to survive in the day, risking sending the masses into a stupor with their dedication and application to the task at hand: batting for the rest of Saturday and the whole of Sunday. They so nearly did it.</p> <p>It was Josh Bohannon, with the help of Danny Lamb, who had set Lancashire up for the kill, moving to the second Championship century of his career and his first Roses hundred slow-quick-slow – which was just what was needed. Wickets came as Lancashire upped the ante before the declaration, but by then the lead was 350.</p> <p>Yorkshire’s woes won’t have been helped by <strong>Northamptonshire</strong>’s progress down at Hove. With a win in touching distance, they will leapfrog Yorkshire to second place in Division Two. Despite a game second innings by <strong>Sussex</strong>, which included a hundred by Tom Haines and 95 for Ben Brown as well as five wickets for Simon Kerrigan, Northants were set just 218 to win. By stumps, they needed only 87 more with eight wickets in hand.</p> <p><strong>Essex</strong> beat <strong>Durham</strong> by 195 runs in an lbw-fest at The Riverside after Peter Siddle and Jamie Porter made mincemeat of their middle and late order. Durham lost five for 38 as the sun slipped down the sky, Alex Lees working hard for his 48. When Jack Burnham became the 19th player to be given out lbw, it was a record in an English first-class match.</p> <p>Daniel Moriarty took his fourth five-wicket haul of his short first-class career, bowling <strong>Gloucestershire</strong> into a hole at The Oval. The <strong>Surrey</strong> bowler took six for 60, and Amar Virdi three for 46, in the first innings, as Gloucestershire were bundled out for 158, with only Miles Hammond in a four-hour 77 providing any bulk to the batting.</p> <p>Following on, meanwhile, Hammond found himself at the crease sooner than he might have hoped and was unbeaten again on 38 at the close, but Gloucester are still 191 behind with just five wickets left.</p> <p>Career-best bowling from Dillon Pennington gave <strong>Worcestershire</strong> the upper hand at New Road. Pennington snaffled four for 44 in the first innings then three for 25 in the next as <strong>Derbyshire</strong> were invited to follow on and crumbled.</p> <p><strong>Leicestershire</strong> need an unlikely 303 to win against <strong>Middlesex</strong> on a turning pitch. Chris Wright had whistled through Middlesex earlier with six for 48.</p> <p>An intriguing final last day lies in wait at Edgbaston as <strong>Warwickshire</strong> and <strong>Nottinghamshire </strong>went nose to nose. Fifties for Michael Burgess and Will Rhodes inched Warwickshire to a lead of 245 by stumps.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60b348698f088d8c3178d773\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-05-30T09:22:53.974Z\">10.22am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>A most beautiful May morning, </strong>the sky milky-eyed blue, the air full of blossom and Paul Allot in his shorts.

Duke doesn’t play a shot and the ball clips the top of off stump. Wood sprints across the grass and is engulfed by the arms and legs of the red rose. A smashing innings from 19-year old Duke, 88 balls of dedication, five dashing fours. Twenty two overs left! Yorkshire 238-7. I’d expect Parkinson to bowl unchanged now from the James Anderson end. A mere 24 overs left, bright sunlight, a rapt if ruddy-faced crowd, five men crouched intently round the batsman. A second for Briggs at Edgbaston, and it is the big(ger) one, Lyndon James after a 2 hour 22 19. Impressive stoic-ing from him, but now it is down to 9-10-Jack. Notts 129-7. Warwickshire whittle out another one: Moores for 21. Notts enter survival mode: 129-6. Duke and Bess bring up a remorseless fifty partnership. The blue sky looks down, surprised. Just four wickets needed Lancashire - where are they? Leicestershire bat on, and on, and on! What a first win of the season this would be - 79 needed, or 8 wickets for Middlesex. Should the runs get ticked off it would be the third highest successful run-chase in Leicestershire’s history. A flattened pitch, but still a stunning reverse. Talking of which, Lancashire and Saqib Mahmood desperate for a bit of reverse-ping, repeatedly polishing the shiny side. The final session of the final day. Three games in the balance. Is your money red or white? Group One Riverside: ESSEX 182 and 301 BEAT DURHAM 99 and 189 by 195 runs Edgbaston: Warwickshire 341 and 264 v Nottinghamshire 297 and 123-5 Nottinghamshire need 186 to win New Road: Worcestershire 421 beat Derbyshire 270 and 128 by an innings and 23 runs. Group Two Grace Road: Leicestershire 136 and 282-2 Middlesex 295 and 218 all out Leicestershire need 96 to win The Oval: Surrey 473 BEAT Gloucestershire 158 and 268 by an innings and 47 runs Group Three Old Trafford: Lancashire 509-9dec v Yorkshire 159 and 208-6 Hove: Northants 256 and 218-7 BEAT Sussex 175 and 298 by seven wicket Tea! Well played Yorkshire. Scores to follow. One over left till tea at Old Trafford. Notts are still five down at Edgbaston, James 18, Moores 21. Another 187 needed if they dare. While Leicestershire are down to a two-figure target. Harris 164, Ackermann 79, the target 99. Luke Wells has a go from the James Anderson end, all long legs and gangly arms. Can he befuddle them with his off-beat leg-breaks as tea approaches? A mini epic at Old Trafford: Bess and Duke v Livingstone and Parkinson. Yorkshire careful, ever so careful. Duke got off the mark to his 39th ball after 49 minutes on 0, during which he seemed completely unbothered by the score. He and Bess patiently press forward. And again. And again. 40 overs left. Harry Duke playing a bravado 28-ball 0. The Foxes are sprinting towards the finish line. Harris has moved to 152, Acermann to 67 and neither Bamber nor Helm nor Andersson nor Walallawita not Hollman nor Gubbins can find an answer. The third-wickset partnership 177. I thought Notts had forgotten how to Notts-up. Seems I was wrong. Mullaney swings to square leg and Rob Yates accepts gratefully. Notts 94-5, James and Moores the men in. A drop! Livingstone at first slip lets Bess through his fingers. Yorkshire 186-6. Forty-four and a half overs left. Some justifiable Surrey crowing. A leg-side stumping! Clarke done by Hannon-Dalby and Burgess for 20. Notts 80-4, need 229 for win. The see-saw has swung.... as it has here! Parkinson sprints over to Livingstone for a hug as Brook props forward and is hit full on the boot. The finger rises. Yorkshire 180-6. Took the chance for a little sun worship in the stands at lunchtime and was struck suddenly by the theatricality of it all when the players came back out. First the umpires marched in unison onto the field in matching black trousers and wide-brimmed hats. Then the Lancashire fielders, rag-tag, fresh from an upper east side rumble; then finally the two Yorkshire batsmen, down the shaded metal staircase into the bright sunlight. It’s just something you don’t normally see from the press box. Parkinson takes a turn from the Brian Statham End. What I enjoy most at the end of his bowling action is the little shuffle of expectation, hands a-cock, like a tap-dancer mid-shuffle. And that’s fifty for Harry Brook, 104 balls, five fours. Well played! If he can be there at the end, he’ll have made his name in a county career that hasn’t yet quite flowered. A century for Marcus Harris, his second for Leicestershire, and 55 for Colin Ackermann defies the sceptics. At 198-2, they are more than half way there: 180 to win. Notts lose Duckett and Slater within an over. My spider senses are a-tingling. Notts 57-3, wickets for Bresnan, Norwell and Briggs. Tom Bailey takes the new ball and - hey presto - three balls later George Hill’s off stump takes a turn for the worse. Worse yet, Saqib Mahmood takes over from Parkinson at the James Anderson end. Yorkshire 152-5. Surrey 473 beat Gloucestershire 158 and 268 Tattersall left high and dry on 86! Moriarty takes his second wicket of the innings, and eighth of the match. Virdi finishes with six in the match. Gloucestershire lose their unbeaten record and Surrey win the second game! Gloucestershire remain top of Group 2 with 107, Somerset on their tails 104, Surrey third 101 (but having played one extra game). Group One Riverside: ESSEX 182 and 301 BEAT DURHAM 99 and 189 by 195 runs Edgbaston: Warwickshire 341 and 264 v Nottinghamshire 297 and 34-1 New Road: Worcestershire 421 beat Derbyshire 270 and 128 by an innings and 23 runs. Group Two Grace Road: Leicestershire 136 and 167-2 Middlesex 295 and 218 all out Leicestershire need 211 to win The Oval: Surrey 473 all out v Gloucestershire 158 and 260-9* Group Three Old Trafford: Lancashire 509-9dec v Yorkshire 159 and 144-4 Hove: Northants 256 and 218-7 BEAT Sussex 175 and 298 by seven wicket *still playing A quietly impressive 50 stand between Brook and Hill, as Hill pushes through the off side. That’s lunch! Fabulous bowling by Mahmood but well batted Yorkies. Lancashire are just three overs away from taking the new ball. Some thoughts around that the press box that the ball might not be spinning as much because the pitch is so abrasive that the ball has gone soft. Or maybe it’s the weather. Or maybe something quite else. To be honest, it is all still a mystery. The Yorkshire Post points out that Tattersall was dropped by Yorkshire for not scoring enough runs... Oh bother, Hass is out for two. Notts 16-1. One last fizz for Parkinson before lunch here at OT, four men close enough to examine Hill’s ear. Virdi has taken one more at The Oval, Tattersall STILL there, 69 not out, but Gloucestershire on the crumble of the cliff. And well done Leicestershire! Harris and Ackermann still there, 157-2. Ah! While I was gazing at the summer fixtures and pondering July, Warwickshire were all out. Notts set 309 to win with England-bound Haseeb Hameed at the crease. Currently 6-0. In days of yore (April) I’d have said Notts had not a chance, but now.... they’ll do it by tea! Four wickets for Fletcher; Burgess 80, Briggs 50. A bowling change at Old Trafford, where the Yorkies had started to look unseasonably comfortable. Liam Livingstone replaces Parkinson after a brief but fruitless flurry from the BS end; and Luke Wood replaces Danny Lamb at the JA end. At The Oval, Amar Virdi snags his third wicket, Matt Taylor for 12. Jonny Tattersall holding out for his adopted team, 51 not out. Northants 256 and 218-7 beat Sussex 175 and 298 This makes it very tasty! More runs for Saif Zaib, 47; Rob Keogh, 60. Northants confirmed in third place in Group 3 with 97 points. Northants trilling merrily on their way - just 19 needed now; while Warwickshire bat on - 250-7 - a lead of 294. Bat on till 2.30 before the declaration? Worcestershire 421 beat Derbyshire 270 and 128 by an innings and 23 runs. Pennington finishes with five - and nine in the match. Only three batsmen in double figures for Derbyshire in a sorry second innings. Just the ticket. Parky replaces Tom Bailey at the Brian Statham End. Meanwhile, Gloucestershire are crumbling, losing their glue, Hammond, to Moriarty for 45 before Smith bowled by Joverton for one. At 148-7, they need 167 to make Surrey bat again. A forlorn hope. Should they lose, Lancashire will be the only team in the Championship with an unbeaten record. The off stump The middle stump... Another for Mahmood! This time it moves away, away and ping the off stump flies! Beautifull. Yorkshire 92-4. A beauty from Saqib Mahmood! A fast inswinger that plucks Fraine’s middle stump and sends it flying. Fraine turns his bat the wrong way round and plods off, the second time in the match he’s had an unplayable ball from Mahmood. Yorkshire 87-3. That man Pennington again! Fourth of the innings, eighth of the match. Derbyshire 188-8, still 33 behind Leicestershire lose their first wicket of the day and it is Sam Evans, who gives John Simpsom some catching practise. Tom Helm pockets his first of the innings and Leics are 85-2. A wicket too soon. A fizzing opening ball from Mahmood which Fraine leaves with an eye-brow raising boldness. The players are out, Patterson pressing forward, forward, forward with his bat as he walks. Mahmood has the ball from the James Anderson end. It has just been pointed out to me that Northants will NOT leap on top of Yorkshire if they win... apologies. If Yorks lose today they will have 99 points; and if Northants win they will have 97. We know Jimmy Anderson would have preferred to take his 1000th wicket at the Roses match, but needs must. Vic over a morning coffee: heaven.

The first “Oh Lanky Lanky” since 2019 trilled over Old Trafford as Lyth stalked towards the dressing room. Seven overs later, the penultimate of the day, Saqib Mahmood hurtled in off his long, long run and pinned Tom Kohler-Cadmore in front of the stumps. Mahmood punched the air while Kohler-Cadmore slumped back off, followed shortly afterwards by a clatter that sounded very much like a bat being thumped repeatedly against a wall. Their frustration was understandable: Kohler-Cadmore and Lyth had batted for 38 of the 47 overs Yorkshire had to survive in the day, risking sending the masses into a stupor with their dedication and application to the task at hand: batting for the rest of Saturday and the whole of Sunday. They so nearly did it. It was Josh Bohannon, with the help of Danny Lamb, who had set Lancashire up for the kill, moving to the second Championship century of his career and his first Roses hundred slow-quick-slow – which was just what was needed. Wickets came as Lancashire upped the ante before the declaration, but by then the lead was 350. Yorkshire’s woes won’t have been helped by Northamptonshire’s progress down at Hove. With a win in touching distance, they will leapfrog Yorkshire to second place in Division Two. Despite a game second innings by Sussex, which included a hundred by Tom Haines and 95 for Ben Brown as well as five wickets for Simon Kerrigan, Northants were set just 218 to win. By stumps, they needed only 87 more with eight wickets in hand. Essex beat Durham by 195 runs in an lbw-fest at The Riverside after Peter Siddle and Jamie Porter made mincemeat of their middle and late order. Durham lost five for 38 as the sun slipped down the sky, Alex Lees working hard for his 48. When Jack Burnham became the 19th player to be given out lbw, it was a record in an English first-class match. Daniel Moriarty took his fourth five-wicket haul of his short first-class career, bowling Gloucestershire into a hole at The Oval. The Surrey bowler took six for 60, and Amar Virdi three for 46, in the first innings, as Gloucestershire were bundled out for 158, with only Miles Hammond in a four-hour 77 providing any bulk to the batting. Following on, meanwhile, Hammond found himself at the crease sooner than he might have hoped and was unbeaten again on 38 at the close, but Gloucester are still 191 behind with just five wickets left. Career-best bowling from Dillon Pennington gave Worcestershire the upper hand at New Road. Pennington snaffled four for 44 in the first innings then three for 25 in the next as Derbyshire were invited to follow on and crumbled. Leicestershire need an unlikely 303 to win against Middlesex on a turning pitch. Chris Wright had whistled through Middlesex earlier with six for 48. An intriguing final last day lies in wait at Edgbaston as Warwickshire and Nottinghamshire went nose to nose. Fifties for Michael Burgess and Will Rhodes inched Warwickshire to a lead of 245 by stumps. A most beautiful May morning, the sky milky-eyed blue, the air full of blossom and Paul Allot in his shorts. Here at Old Trafford, a thriller awaits as Yorkshire attempt to bat out the day and Lancashire, with Parky whirling and Mahmood charging, press for the kill. Elsewhere, Northants should knock off the runs this morning; Leicester have to defy the might of Middlesex; at The Oval Miles Hammond lies between Surrey and victory; Worcestershire are on course to roll-over Derbyshire and a close match awaits at Edgbaston.","charCount":"13956","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/tanyaaldred\">Tanya Aldred</a> at Old Trafford"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2021/may/30/the-shameful-failures-that-threw-care-home-residents-to-covid","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-30T15:51:09Z","webTitle":"The shameful failures that threw care home residents to Covid | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/30/the-shameful-failures-that-threw-care-home-residents-to-covid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/may/30/the-shameful-failures-that-threw-care-home-residents-to-covid","fields":{"headline":"The shameful failures that threw care home residents to Covid","standfirst":"<p>Readers on the government’s mistakes and neglect that meant elderly patients were discharged to care homes, without a Covid test, at the height of the pandemic</p>","trailText":"<strong>Letters: </strong>Readers on the government’s mistakes and neglect that meant elderly patients were discharged to care homes, without a Covid test, at the height of the pandemic","byline":"Letters","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d24ece849a095a41949b75c486594a9008ed8996\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d24ece849a095a41949b75c486594a9008ed8996/0_142_4291_2576/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Health secretary Matt Hancock\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘I only wish Matt Hancock and those at the top would accept the responsibility they have for those whose lives could have been saved.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hollie Adams/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>I am no fan of Dominic Cummings but I am pleased that the evidence he gave last week has opened up the conversation regarding discharges to care homes (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/25/dominic-cummings-says-pm-had-no-plan-to-protect-vulnerable-people-from-covid\" title=\"\">Dominic Cummings says PM had no plan to protect vulnerable people from Covid</a>, 25 May).</p> <p>I am a nurse and during the first wave of Covid-19 I was on a ward that was caring for elderly patients.

Details of the 1921 Tulsa race massacre, which saw the razing of the prosperous Greenwood neighborhood known as the Black Wall Street, were hidden for decades as authorities covered up the existence of mass graves and destroyed evidence of thousands of Black people being interned by the Oklahoma national guard. The riot began after armed members of the Black community attempted to prevent the lynching of a youth accused of assaulting a white woman. Hundreds of Black-owned businesses, churches and homes were burned, leaving an estimated 8,000 homeless and 800 more injured. In recent years, historians have joined with activist groups and descendants of the victims to expose the truth of the atrocity, which will be remembered in events in the city this week including a visit on Tuesday from President Joe Biden. The anniversary comes at a critical time for race relations in the US, following high-profile police killings of African Americans including George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. Law enforcement organisations around the US have been warned by the federal Department of Homeland Security of the potential for targeted violence at events to commemorate the Tulsa massacre, a federal official told the Associated Press. The official said the alert was issued given the nature of the commemoration and the “volatile threat environment”. Scott Ellsworth, a University of Michigan historian whose book Death in a Promised Land helped put Tulsa on the pathway to confronting its racist past, told the Guardian: “The story of the massacre was actively suppressed in the white community for 50 years. “Some people don’t want to talk about this at all; they just want to cover it back up. Others are shameful about it. Others are heartbroken. You had whole generations of people who grew up in Tulsa not knowing about it.” Earlier this month, Viola Fletcher, 107, the oldest survivor of the massacre, testified before Congress that she was still seeking justice. “I am here asking my country to acknowledge what happened in Tulsa in 1921,” she said. “The night of the massacre, I was awakened by my family. My parents and five siblings were there. I was told we had to leave and that was it. “I will never forget the violence of the white mob when we left our home. I still see Black men being shot, Black bodies lying in the street. I still smell smoke and see fire. I still see Black businesses being burned. I still hear airplanes flying overhead. I hear the screams. I have lived through the massacre every day.” Two groups, the 1921 Tulsa race massacre centennial commission, and the Black Wall Street legacy festival, will host events through the week. A Remember &amp; Rise ceremony planned for Monday, however, was cancelled amid a dispute over payments to survivors. The event was due to feature a performance from John Legend and a speech from the voting rights campaigner Stacey Abrams. Neither Legend of Abrams immediately commented on the cancellation. Other commemorations will include marches, talks and the opening of a $30m history centre and museum featuring photographs of Greenwood in the 1920s. Among those honored will be Loula Tom Williams, a Greenwood entrepreneur and owner of the Dreamland Theatre, a de facto Black community centre that was burned by the mob.","charCount":"3523","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/richardluscombe\">Richard Luscombe</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2021/may/30/ngolo-kante-the-one-man-midfield-who-conquered-europe-for-chelsea","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-30T15:43:29Z","webTitle":"N’Golo Kanté: the one-man midfield who conquered Europe for Chelsea | Barney Ronay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/may/30/ngolo-kante-the-one-man-midfield-who-conquered-europe-for-chelsea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2021/may/30/ngolo-kante-the-one-man-midfield-who-conquered-europe-for-chelsea","fields":{"headline":"N’Golo Kanté: the one-man midfield who conquered Europe for Chelsea","standfirst":"<p>As every successful Chelsea manager has twigged, N’Golo Kanté is the great hidden gift in this group of players</p>","trailText":"As every successful Chelsea manager has twigged, N’Golo Kanté is the great hidden gift in this group of players","byline":"Barney Ronay in Porto","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ea701ddc8a9a8ee5c80d3a300dc59f93621a63b8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea701ddc8a9a8ee5c80d3a300dc59f93621a63b8/0_38_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chelsea’s N’Golo Kante celebrates with the European Cup in Porto\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chelsea’s N’Golo Kante celebrates with the European Cup in Porto.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Ramos/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>The Champions League final of 2021 will be remembered as the night when Manchester City sent out an excess of midfielders, a tripling-up of midfielders, a team clogging every hole with essence of midfielder.

NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson said a “much better quality of debate” was needed on the implications of easing measures, according to the BBC. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/may/29/we-faced-an-unprecedented-crisis-but-tens-of-thousands-of-second-wave-covid-deaths-were-avoidable-and-unforgivable\">Writing in The Observer, opposition leader Sir Keir Starmer </a>said “weak, slow decisions” by the Government on border policy had allowed the Indian variant to spread.</p> <p>Meanwhile, leaders of Australia and New Zealand have had their first face-to-face meeting since the coronavirus outbreak prompted both countries to close their borders.

Since allegations of potential fraud at several providers were made public earlier this week and Spahn said on Saturday that there will be stricter controls, a debate has started on how to control the test centres and who should be in charge. Germany offers its citizens at least one free coronavirus test per week, with several federal states providing one free test a day. The state pays 18 euros ($22) per test. As a result, private test centres have been set up en masse in recent weeks. Some coronavirus test centres have been charging for more tests than they have carried out, daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung and broadcaster ARD reported this week. Lars Klingbeil, Secretary General of the opposition Social Democrats, told daily Tagesspiegel’s Sunday edition: I find it incomprehensible that despite warnings Jens Spahn has left such loopholes for cheaters. Spahn announced more random checks on Saturday: Pragmatism is necessary these days. Those who exploit that must not be allowed to get away with it. Spahn will have a call with his state counterparts on Monday morning and discuss next steps, the spokesman said. The number of new coronavirus cases in Germany has fallen further this weekend. The Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases reported a 3,852 rise in cases on Sunday, 2,862 less than a week earlier. The seven-day rate of infection fell to 35 per 100,000 people, down from around 64 last week. So far, Germany has seen 3.68 million cases, the death toll stands at 88,406. Around 42% of its population have been given at least a first shot of a Covid-19 vaccine, 17% have had their second dose. That’s it from me, Caroline Davies, for today. Handing over to my colleague Nicola Slawson. Thanks for your time. Ministers have been urged not to “threaten” NHS staff by forcing them to get vaccinated against coronavirus under plans being considered by the government. The shadow Commons leader, Thangam Debbonaire, said it was not a “good idea” after the vaccines minister, Nadhim Zahawi, admitted the proposal was being investigated alongside the existing consultation on making jabs mandatory for social care workers. There is nervousness in Whitehall about doing anything to destabilise the vaccine rollout by requiring that people get the jab instead of keeping it voluntary – something that several behavioural scientists have warned could dampen take-up among already vaccine-hesitant groups. But after concerns that a sizeable number of health and social care staff, who were among the first to be offered the vaccine, are reluctant to get jabbed, the government has been consulting on making vaccines mandatory for care workers, and is now expanding that to include all those working in the NHS. Key developments so far today: UK vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi confirmed the government was considering whether coronavirus jabs should be compulsory for NHS staff. He said: “It’s absolutely the right thing and it would be incumbent on any responsible government to have the debate, to do the thinking as to how we go about protecting the most vulnerable by making sure that those who look after them are vaccinated. The UK government is waiting for the latest data on June 14 before deciding whether to proceed with easing the lockdown on June 21, Zahawi said. British regulators were still considering whether to offer jabs to children. Zahawi said: “Our own regulator has not yet approved giving vaccines to children. You have to make sure the vaccines are incredibly safe before you give them to children.” Italy has extended an entry ban for people coming from India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, as a continued precaution against the more transmissible Indian variant. The ban, which does not apply to Italian citizens, was introduced in late April and was due to expire on Sunday. It was prolonged until 21 June. The theory that the coronavirus outbreak began with a leak from a Chinese laboratory in Wuhan has not been ruled out, according to a health expert affiliated with the WHO. India has reported its lowest daily rise in new coronavirus infections in 46 days at 165,553 cases during the previous 24 hours, while deaths rose by 3,460. Kenya has extended its nightly curfew by 60 days to slow the spread of Covid-19, the interior ministry said. People who remain chronically ill after Covid infections in England have had to wait months for appointments and treatment at specialist clinics set up to handle the surge in patients with long Covid. More than half of people in their 30s in England have received a coronavirus vaccination in a period of little over two weeks, new figures reveal.NHS England said that, since it began opening up the vaccine rollout to this age group on May 13, 53% of those aged 30 to 39 have been given at least one dose. The leaders of Australia and New Zealand have had their first face-to-face meeting since the coronavirus outbreak prompted both countries to close their borders. Australian prime minister Scott Morrison arrived in the tourist resort of Queenstown for an overnight visit on Sunday. He greeted his New Zealand counterpart Jacinda Ardern with a traditional Maori hongi, in which the pair pressed noses together. People who remain chronically ill after Covid infections in England have had to wait months for appointments and treatment at specialist clinics set up to handle the surge in patients with long Covid. MPs called on Matt Hancock to explain the lengthy waiting times and what they described as a “shameful postcode lottery” which left some patients facing delays of more than four months before being assessed at a specialist centre while others were seen within days. NHS England announced in December that people with long Covid, or post-Covid syndrome, could seek help at more than 60 specialist clinics. But despite government assertions in January that the network of 69 centres was already operating, the all-party parliamentary group on coronavirus found that some clinics were still not up and running three months later. The theory that the coronavirus outbreak began with a leak from a Chinese laboratory in Wuhan has not been ruled out, according to a health expert affiliated with the WHO. Dr Dale Fisher, chair of the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, which is coordinated by the WHO, said the WHO’s investigation into the origins of the virus had only just begun. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s World This Weekend he said: “The lab leak theory is not off the table, there’s more research to be done.” An investigation visit by WHO experts earlier this year, which was highly controlled by the Chinese authorities, concluded it “extremely unlikely” that the pandemic began with a laboratory incident. Fisher said this theory remained “unverified” despite a report, based on US intelligence, which claimed three members of staff at the lab had become sick with Covid-like in early December 2019. He urged the US to share this intelligence. Fisher said: “We believe that all the laboratory workers have had serology [tests] done and all those antibody tests were negative and that was part of the reason why the risk was downplayed.” Fisher added: “WHO could do itself a favour, by describing the plans for further investigation because people really haven’t heard anything since the February mission was done and therefore people think they’ve stopped looking for the origins, which is far from the truth, it’s only really just begun.” He also suggested China’s secrecy about the origins of the virus could be driven by fears of compensation claims. Fisher said: “Any country that found any Covid-19 in its borders before the outbreak started would suddenly clam up. This is why I would argue that diplomacy is the way forward with this, creating a no blame culture. The only way you really can get to the bottom of this is just to say ‘look there’s no penalties, we just need to sort this out’.” Kenya has extended its nightly curfew by 60 days to slow the spread of Covid-19, the interior ministry said, according to the Reuters news agency. The move followed a decision by President Uhuru Kenyatta in late March to extend the 10pm to 4am curfew. A ban on political gatherings and processions that could turn into super spreader events was also extended for 60 days, as was a prohibition on overnight events and vigils, the ministry said. When the first coronavirus cases were confirmed in Kenya in March 2020, the government closed schools, imposed a curfew, banned public gatherings and on multiple occasions restricted movement in and out of the most-affected regions. Some restrictions, such as on schools, were eventually relaxed. The ban on public gatherings and processions and overnight meetings will stay in force, the ministry said. Kenya has recorded 170,485 cases and 3,141 deaths, Ministry of Health data showed on Saturday, with a positivity rate of 8.9%. Covid-19 vaccinations began on March 5 and so far 968,733 people have received their first dose. Boris Johnson faces a difficult decision about whether to end England’s lockdown on June 21 with hospitals already under “worrying” pressure, a health chief has warned. According to the Press Association news agency, NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson said hospital bosses were concerned about the transmissibility of the B1617.2 variant and the large number of people who have still to receive doses of the vaccine. He warned that although hospitals were not expecting to be overwhelmed by a surge of Covid-19 cases, they were already stretched by going “full pelt” on dealing with the backlog of cases built up during the pandemic and urgent care needs. Hopson said: Significant numbers of Covid-19 hospital inpatients will adversely impact care backlog recovery, (the) current degree of pressure on hospitals is worrying especially since we saw clear summer demand surges in the two years before Covid-19. But if, as evidence above suggests, success of (the) vaccination campaign means much lower levels of hospitalisation, serious illness and mortality, even with (the) new variant, that is very significant and important. This means there is a difficult decision to make for June 21. He also suggested the government needs to consider the increased burden on hospitals in UK holiday hotspots in coming months with people not travelling abroad, saying one trust chief on the south coast had warned they will “struggle” to meet the “significant extra demand”. Dr Mike Tildesley, a member of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (Spi-M) Government advisory panel, said there was still “quite a lot of uncertainty” around the June 21 date. He told LBC radio scientists had “an awful lot of work to do” to analyse data on the link between cases and hospital admissions, while bearing in mind the situation with the Indian variant, to give evidence to the government. South Korea will get 1m doses of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s vaccine this week mainly to inoculate military personnel, after the United States almost doubled a pledge made earlier this month, prime minister Kim Boo-kyum said on Sunday. South Korea has reported a lower death toll than many comparable developed countries from Covid-19, but the government has come under criticism for a comparatively slow rollout of vaccines, Reuters reports. Less than 11% of its 52 million people have so far received a first dose. US President Joe Biden, at his first summit with President Moon Jae-in earlier this month, promised to supply 550,000 shots for South Korean troops. Kim said that offer had now been increased to 1m doses, and the shots will arrive this week. On care homes, UK vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi today defended the government approach. Boris Johnson’s former aide Dominic Cummings claimed the health secretary, Matt Hancock, had lied to the prime minister over tests being carried out on those discharged into care homes – a charge denied by Hancock. Zahawi said the government had made the best use of the limited testing capacity available when the pandemic struck and it had put a “protective ring” around care homes. Asked whether Hancock had promised care home residents would be tested before discharge from hospital, Zahawi told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: Matt Hancock was very much focused on delivery, I think it’s worth putting this in context … in the sense that in the eye of the storm, we were only able to do 2,000 tests a day. The diagnostics industry was almost non-existent in the UK. He added Hancock had said that “people going into care homes absolutely should be tested and the system, the NHS, operationalised that” as testing capacity increased. Asked why people had been sent home without tests, Zahawi said “hindsight is a wonderful thing”, adding: We can sit here and sort of argue the toss about asymptomatic transmission … and when we really knew about that. The whole point is you use every resource available to you, to the best of your ability, to save and to protect as many people as possible. There have been more than 36,275 deaths involving Covid-19 in care homes since the pandemic began. Zahawi said: When the inquiry is held, and we will look at all these things in detail, we will of course examine where we could do better. But to say that we didn’t deal with them to the best of our capability, with the resources that were available to us, is a mistake, is wrong. Italy has extended an entry ban for people coming from India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, as a continued precaution against the more transmissible Indian variant. The ban, which does not apply to Italian citizens, was introduced in late April and was due to expire on Sunday. It was prolonged until 21 June, a spokesman for Italian health minister Roberto Speranza said in a statement. Care homes were “forgotten” during the “dreadful” early stages of the Covid pandemic in the UK, a sector leader has said. Mike Padgham, the chairman of the Independent Care Group, which represents providers in York and North Yorkshire, told Sky News it had been a “frightening” time for staff and residents. Padgham was questioned in relation to the claim made by former Downing Street adviser Dominic Cummings to MPs this week that suggestions care homes were shielded were “complete nonsense”. Padgham said: I don’t believe myself there was a ring of protection thrown round us. In those very early days it was difficult. We were forgotten. We’ve been forgotten over decades. That’s the only issue in social care. We weren’t prepared. We weren’t ready. We didn’t have the PPE, we didn’t have the testing. And it took the government many, many weeks to actually see what was happening in homes, despite our best efforts and protestations. That is why providers … without their efforts, the figures … would have been much worse.” Vietnam’s business hub Ho Chi Minh City will begin social distancing measures in the city for 15 days starting from Monday in an effort to curb the spread of the coronavirus, according to the state-run Tuoi Tre newspaper reported on Sunday. “All events that gather more than 10 people in public are banned city-wide, but the city is considering to lower the number of people to just five,” the newspaper reported. “While all citizens of Go Vap district are not allowed to go out if not necessary,” the report added. Ho Chi Minh City earlier this week shut down shops and restaurants. A leading scientist has called for stallholders at the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan to be interviewed in any further investigation of the Covid-19 epidemic. Dr Eddie Holmes has joined a growing chorus of voices calling for further investigation into the source of the pandemic. The US president, Joe Biden, has ordered the US intelligence community to intensify its efforts to study the origins of coronavirus, as the theory that the virus might have come from a lab in Wuhan gains traction. He revealed that two of the 18 intelligence agencies are leaning towards the animal link and one leans more toward the lab theory. It is still thought by many that the market in Wuhan is at the centre of the Covid-19 breakout and that the virus jumped from an animal species to humans. On 31 January 2021, a team of scientists led by the World Health Organization visited the market. However, according to their report only two stall operators were interviewed, and neither was engaged in trading wildlife. Edward Holmes, an expert in the evolution and emergence of infectious diseases at the University of Sydney, who saw live wildlife being traded at the Huanan market in 2014, said: “As wildlife present the greatest risk, this should have been the priority in the WHO’s investigation of the market. “However, I’m not sure who controlled the WHO’s schedule so it may have been out of their hands,” he added. “At the very least these stallholders need to be reinterviewed in any additional investigation into the virus origins.” Taiwan reported 355 domestic Covid-19 cases on Sunday. After recording just a handful of daily infections for months, Taiwan is dealing with relatively large numbers of community transmissions, though infection rates are starting to fall. It has only vaccinated around 1% of its more than 23 million people but has almost 30 million shots on order, from AstraZeneca Plc, Moderna Inc and two domestic firms. The UK government is waiting for the latest data on June 14 before deciding whether to proceed with easing the lockdown on June 21, vaccine minister Nadhim Zahawi said. Asked whether that step could be taken if cases were still increasing, he told BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show: What I’m saying to you is we have to be cautious. We have to look at the data and share it with the country. Are we still vaccinating at scale? Big tick. Are the vaccines working? Yes. But are infection rates too high for us to then not be able to proceed because there are too many people getting into hospital? I don’t know the answer to it. But we will know it on, hopefully on the 14th, a few more weeks. He said that as the virus becomes endemic “we’re going to have to live with a certain amount of Covid being transmitted”. On the possible compulsory vaccination of NHS staff in the UK, the shadow cabinet minister Thangam Debbonaire said “threatening” NHS staff to have the vaccine was not a good idea. The shadow Commons leader told Sky News: Given we have got a recruitment crisis in parts of the NHS I think it’s far more important we try and work with staff rather than against them. Threatening staff, I don’t think is a good idea.” Public Health England and the NHS had been successful when they had worked with people to address their doubts and answer questions about the jab, she said. I would like to see the government work with the NHS and social care staff. More on the question of vaccinating children, one expert has said that the emergence of new variants could influence the decision in the UK. Prof Peter Openshaw, a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), told Times Radio that there were “debates” about the possible risks of “very, very rare complications” associated with vaccination, which had to be balanced against the “certainty” that someone can get “very severe complications” by catching Covid. Speaking in a personal capacity, he added: It may well be that actually giving children vaccines will become a clearer option once we know more about the disease in children and whether the new variants are spreading further into the paediatric population and causing more significant disease. That could certainly change the risk-benefit ratio.” Prof Openshaw said the UK placed an emphasis on “public health benefits” and therefore “vaccinating those who may be transmitting disease, sometimes unknowingly, is a perfectly good justification for vaccination”. He added: The new variants extending further down the age range and being of quite high prevalence even in children as young as four, it may be that actually children and school children are going to be a more important part of the transmission chain as the virus becomes more transmissible as new variants arise. So... the benefits might change and that might affect the decision about whether to vaccinate children in the future. British regulators were still considering whether to offer jabs to children, UK vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi told Sky News: Our own regulator has not yet approved giving vaccines to children. You have to make sure the vaccines are incredibly safe before you give them to children. The Pfizer jab has been approved for use in 12-year-olds by regulators in the European Union, US and Canada and Zahawi said the “infrastructure” was in place to jab children in the UK if required. But he said the issue was complicated because the main benefits of the jab were not necessarily felt by children themselves but instead by those around them. He said: On the whole you are vaccinating to protect their families and their communities and the country. UK vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi confirmed the government was considering whether coronavirus jabs should be compulsory for NHS staff. He told Sky News: It’s absolutely the right thing and it would be incumbent on any responsible government to have the debate, to do the thinking as to how we go about protecting the most vulnerable by making sure that those who look after them are vaccinated. There is precedent for this, obviously surgeons get vaccinated for hepatitis B, so it’s something that we are absolutely thinking about. He also said that the World Health Organisation investigation must be able to fully investigate the origins of the pandemic. The Sunday Times reported that British agents believe it is “feasible” that the crisis began with a coronavirus leak from a Chinese research laboratory in Wuhan. Asked about the report, Zahawi said: I think it’s really important that the WHO is allowed to conduct its investigation unencumbered into the origins of this pandemic and that we should leave no stone unturned to understand why – not only because of the current pandemic that has swept the world but also for future-proofing the world’s capability to deal with pandemics. Russia reported 9,694 new cases on Sunday, the highest number since the end of March, which took the national tally to 5,063,442 infections. The Russian coronavirus taskforce said that 355 more deaths of Covid-19 patients were confirmed in the past 24 hours, bringing the official death toll to 121,162. The federal statistics agency has kept a separate count and has said Russia recorded around 250,000 deaths related to Covid-19 from April 2020 to March 2021, Reuters reports. The British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) chief executive Emma McClarkin has called on the UK government to provide advance notice to businesses if restrictions are to remain after June 21. McClarkin acknowledged the government was in a “difficult situation” but said Whitehall had to “stick to its road map”. She told BBC Breakfast: We need the Government to stick to its road map of removing those restrictions by the 21st of June if we want to see the great British pub really begin its recovery. What I need to say is June 21 is absolutely critical to the recovery of the sector. Recovery day only starts when the restrictions are removed. If the Government does leave any lingering restrictions in play then they really need to give us advance notice of that and it needs to talk seriously about financial compensation. But right now we are asking the Government to stick to their road map. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 3,852 to 3,679,148, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Sunday. The reported death toll rose by 56 to 88,406, the tally showed. Malaysia is planning to set up more mega vaccination centres and get private doctors to join immunisation efforts, after five consecutive days of record daily coronavirus infections, Reuters reports. Science minister Khairy Jamaluddin told a virtual news briefing on Sunday that the government will set up another five mega vaccination centres around the capital, Kuala Lumpur, and are considering two in the northen state of Penang and in the southern state of Johor. Nearly 6% of the country’s 32 million people have been vaccinated, according to the website of the governmental Special Committee for Ensuring Access to COVID-19 Vaccine Supply. Khairy said the government is also looking to allow drive-through vaccination centres in the country, after guidelines are firmed up. Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin on Friday announced a nationwide total lockdown from June 1-14 in an effort to curb the spread of the virus. Malaysia reported 6,999 new cases on Sunday, bringing the total infections in the country to 565,533. More than half of people in their 30s in England have received a coronavirus vaccination in a period of little over two weeks, new figures reveal. NHS England said that, since it began opening up the vaccine rollout to this age group on May 13, 53% of those aged 30 to 39 have been given at least one dose. The data comes as Prof Stephen Reicher, a psychologist on the Sage sub-committee advising ministers on behavioural science, said the government was in a “pickle” because it appeared to have abandoned the “data not dates” principle. The NHS, meanwhile, is asking people aged 50 and older, as well as those who are clinically vulnerable, to bring forward their second Covid-19 vaccination to help combat the spread of the B1.617.2 variant first identified in India. It follows the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) recommending earlier this month that the second dose interval be shortened from 12 weeks to eight for people in priority cohorts. India today reported its lowest daily rise in new coronavirus infections in 46 days at 165,553 cases during the previous 24 hours, while deaths rose by 3,460. The south Asian nation’s tally of infections now stands at 27.9m, with a death toll of 325,972, health ministry data showed on Sunday. Good morning, and welcome to the coronavirus global blog. Caroline Davies here, taking you through key developments today. You can get in touch on caroline.davies@theguardian.com. In the UK, there are calls for a more informed debate on the planned lifting of all legal limits on social contact in England on June 21 as Labour questioned if the move would proceed. The continued spread of the Indian coronavirus variant has prompted experts to argue restrictions should remain in place until more people have received both doses of a vaccine amid reports ministers are drawing up plans for a partial end of lockdown. NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson said a “much better quality of debate” was needed on the implications of easing measures, according to the BBC. Writing in The Observer, opposition leader Sir Keir Starmer said “weak, slow decisions” by the Government on border policy had allowed the Indian variant to spread. Meanwhile, leaders of Australia and New Zealand have had their first face-to-face meeting since the coronavirus outbreak prompted both countries to close their borders. Australian prime minister Scott Morrison arrived in the tourist resort of Queenstown for an overnight visit on Sunday. He greeted his New Zealand counterpart Jacinda Ardern with a traditional Maori hongi, in which the pair pressed noses together. Morrison is the first major world leader to visit New Zealand since both countries shut their borders last year to contain the virus. The neighbours opened a quarantine-free travel bubble last month, although a recent outbreak of the virus in Melbourne has prompted New Zealand to suspend the arrangement with Victoria state.","charCount":"28003","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/nicola-slawson\">Nicola Slawson</a> (now); <a href=\"profile/carolinedavies\">Caroline Davies</a> and <a href=\"profile/maya-wolfe-robinson\">Maya Wolfe-Robinson</a> (earlier)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2021/may/30/cycling-giro-ditalia-egan-bernal-milan","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-30T15:21:59Z","webTitle":"Egan Bernal seals Giro d’Italia title after final time trial stage in Milan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/may/30/cycling-giro-ditalia-egan-bernal-milan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2021/may/30/cycling-giro-ditalia-egan-bernal-milan","fields":{"headline":"Egan Bernal seals Giro d’Italia title after final time trial stage in Milan","standfirst":"<ul><li>Colombian beats Italy’s Damiano Caruso by 1m 29s</li><li>Britain’s Simon Yates third, Filippo Ganna wins stage</li></ul>","trailText":"Egan Bernal has secured the Giro d’Italia title by a margin of 1m 29s after the closing time trial in Milan","byline":"Guardian sport","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fd37a5a3370887b9fb5eada3f503e94cba6c0c1d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd37a5a3370887b9fb5eada3f503e94cba6c0c1d/0_69_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Egan Bernal celebrates after crossing the finish line in Milan to seal his second grand tour title.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Egan Bernal celebrates after crossing the finish line in Milan to seal his second grand tour title.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jennifer Lorenzini/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Egan Bernal has secured the Giro d’Italia title after holding on to his overall lead in the closing time trial in Milan.</p> <p>The Ineos Grenadiers rider began the final stage with a 1min 59sec lead over surprise challenger Damiano Caruso (Bahrain Victorious), and held on comfortably, losing only 30 seconds to Caruso and winning his second grand tour.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/may/25/giro-ditalia-egan-bernal-rolling-towards-glory-amid-ineos-stranglehold\">Giro d’Italia: Egan Bernal rolling towards glory amid Ineos stranglehold</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Britain’s Simon Yates (Team BikeExchange) finished third, 4m 15s behind Bernal.

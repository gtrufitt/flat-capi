Yorkshire eventually got their hands on the new ball they had been after all day, and it tookonly five overs to make a breakthrough as Jennings was caught at first slip after a partnership of 175 with Wells. One became three as Wells, then Livingstone followed. But on Lancashire went. For a while it seemed they would try for maximum batting bonus points as Dane Vilas straight drove Steven Patterson for four, then dropped to one knee and pulled him behind square, and Bess was biffed for straight sixes, with Josh Bohannon reaching the scorers’ box high in the media centre. But sense soon prevailed and the grind, grind, grind returned.</p> <p>A sixth wicket stand of 125 between Ryan ten Doeschate (55) and Adam Wheater (81) rescued <strong>Essex</strong> from an unbecoming 53 for five to finish the day with a towering lead at Chester-le-Street. <strong>Durham </strong>were earlier bowled out for 99; such was the haste of their demise that Simon Harmer didn’t even get to wrap his bowling fingers around the ball.</p> <p>Saif Zaib’s 64 helped <strong>Northants</strong> to a handy first-innings lead at Hove.

class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A coronavirus surge sweeping through <strong>Thailand’s</strong> prisons has thrown the spotlight on the kingdom’s overcrowded penal system, where some inmates have less space to sleep than the inside of a coffin.</p> <p>AFP reports:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>More than 22,000 people have tested positive inside jails, where inmates living cheek by jowl have been encouraged to keep wearing their masks even while they sleep.</p> <p>Authorities have floated plans to give early releases to prisoners with underlying medical conditions and have announced funding for more testing and medical care in recent days.</p> <p>But those behind bars say they have been kept in the dark about the seriousness of the outbreak.</p> <p>“Prisoners don’t have the knowledge to protect themselves,” said <strong>Somyot Prueksakasemsuk</strong>, a high-profile activist facing charges under Thailand’s harsh royal defamation law.</p> <p>Somyot was bailed last month and told AFP that he had not been tested for Covid-19 once during his 10-week stint in custody.</p> <p>He was not worried about contracting the disease while in jail because he had no idea about the level of risk.</p> <p>“But after this I’m so scared [for everyone still inside] ... if you are inside the prison you are at risk, it’s unavoidable,” he said.</p> <p>Thailand’s prison outbreak has skyrocketed from just 10 publicly announced cases a month ago and sparked growing public concern after a handful of prominent activists contracted the illness.</p> <p>Among them was student leader Panusaya “Rung” Sithijirawattanakul, who helped lead a series of rallies last year demanding political reforms in the kingdom, and who tested positive after she was released on bail.</p> <p>The Thai prison population stood at around 311,000 earlier this year, the International Federation for Human Rights said – more than two and a half times the system’s official capacity.</p> <p>Four inmates in every five are serving time for drug charges because of harsh anti-narcotics laws that can see offenders jailed for a decade for possessing just a few methamphetamine pills.</p> <p>Many cells are so packed with bodies that some inmates only have half a metre (less than 2ft) of space.</p> <p>“That is less room for a body than the inside of a coffin,” justice minister <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Somsak Thepsutin</strong> told local media in February.</p> <p>Officials have tested more than 36,000 inmates in recent weeks and begun delivering Covid vaccines to inmates and prison staff.</p> <p>Somsak said he was examining ways to give early releases to prisoners with underlying medical conditions, possibly through a royal pardon.</p> <p>Even if the plan goes ahead, prisoners will still have to complete a quarantine before returning home.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-05-29T10:22:05.419Z\">at 11.22am BST</time></p>  </div> <div

the revised numbers will affect the budget deficit when expressed as percentage of GDP, which was previously forecast to hit 9% this year, a postwar record.

AFP reports: More than 22,000 people have tested positive inside jails, where inmates living cheek by jowl have been encouraged to keep wearing their masks even while they sleep. Authorities have floated plans to give early releases to prisoners with underlying medical conditions and have announced funding for more testing and medical care in recent days. But those behind bars say they have been kept in the dark about the seriousness of the outbreak. “Prisoners don’t have the knowledge to protect themselves,” said Somyot Prueksakasemsuk, a high-profile activist facing charges under Thailand’s harsh royal defamation law. Somyot was bailed last month and told AFP that he had not been tested for Covid-19 once during his 10-week stint in custody. He was not worried about contracting the disease while in jail because he had no idea about the level of risk. “But after this I’m so scared [for everyone still inside] ... if you are inside the prison you are at risk, it’s unavoidable,” he said. Thailand’s prison outbreak has skyrocketed from just 10 publicly announced cases a month ago and sparked growing public concern after a handful of prominent activists contracted the illness. Among them was student leader Panusaya “Rung” Sithijirawattanakul, who helped lead a series of rallies last year demanding political reforms in the kingdom, and who tested positive after she was released on bail. The Thai prison population stood at around 311,000 earlier this year, the International Federation for Human Rights said – more than two and a half times the system’s official capacity. Four inmates in every five are serving time for drug charges because of harsh anti-narcotics laws that can see offenders jailed for a decade for possessing just a few methamphetamine pills. Many cells are so packed with bodies that some inmates only have half a metre (less than 2ft) of space. “That is less room for a body than the inside of a coffin,” justice minister Somsak Thepsutin told local media in February. Officials have tested more than 36,000 inmates in recent weeks and begun delivering Covid vaccines to inmates and prison staff. Somsak said he was examining ways to give early releases to prisoners with underlying medical conditions, possibly through a royal pardon. Even if the plan goes ahead, prisoners will still have to complete a quarantine before returning home. India has recorded the lowest number of new daily infections in 45 days, the Times of India reports, although a further 173,790 fresh cases were logged in the country on Saturday. The official death toll climbed to 322,512 as a further 3,617 Covid fatalities recorded on Saturday, according to health ministry data. Daily recoveries continue to outnumber the daily new cases for the 16th consecutive day. A total of 2,080,048 samples were tested in the last 24 hours, according to the Indian Council of Medical Research. The governing civic body of Mumbai on Friday allowed walk-in vaccination for students who have been accepted for university courses abroad and require immunisation to travel. France’s budget deficit for 2021 will stand at €220bn, some €47bn higher than previously estimated, Olivier Dussopt, the public accounts minister, told AFP on Saturday. The increase is “a result of supporting measures that we’re continuing to take to support the recovery” from the devastating effects that Covid-19 shutdowns wreaked on the eurozone’s second-largest economy, he said. It is not yet clear how the revised numbers will affect the budget deficit when expressed as percentage of GDP, which was previously forecast to hit 9% this year, a postwar record. Public debt was previously forecast to reach 118% of GDP. The Covid-19 pandemic is expected to cost the French state nearly half a trillion euros over three years - €158bn in 2020, an expected €171bn in 2021 and a forecast €96bn in 2022, Dussopt said in April. France has borrowed heavily to try to keep the economy afloat through three nationwide lockdowns, including money spent on supporting salaries of people furloughed and aid for companies struggling to stay afloat during the crisis. The southern Chinese city of Guangzhou shut down a neighborhood and ordered its residents to stay home on Saturday for door-to-door coronavirus testing following an upsurge in infections. Guangzhou, a business and industrial centre of 15 million people north of Hong Hong, has reported 20 new infections over the past week. The number is small compared with India’s thousands of daily cases but has alarmed Chinese authorities who believed they had the virus under control. The spread of infections was “fast and strong,” the Global Times newspaper cited health authorities as saying. Saturday’s order to stay home applied to residents of five streets in Liwan district in the city centre. Outdoor markets, childcare centres and entertainment venues were closed. Indoor restaurant dining was prohibited, while grade schools were told to stop in-person tuition. People in parts of four nearby districts were ordered to limit outdoor activity. The city government earlier ordered testing of hundreds of thousands of residents following the initial infections. The government said some 700,000 people had been tested by Wednesday. China reports a handful of new cases every day but says almost all are believed to be people who were infected abroad, the Associated Press reports. The mainland’s official death toll stands at 4,636 out of 91,061 confirmed cases. On Saturday, the National Health Commission reported two new locally transmitted cases in Guangzhou and 14 in other parts of the country that it said came from abroad. Most of the latest infections in Guangzhou are believed to be linked to a 75-year-old woman who was found on 21 May to have the variant first identified in India, state media say. Most of the others attended a dinner with her or live together. That infection spread to the nearby city of Nanshan, where one new confirmed case and two asymptomatic cases were reported Saturday after people from Guangzhou were tested, according to the Global Times. Infections in Germany continue on a downward trend, according to the country’s Robert Koch Institute (RKI), with health authorities having reported 5,426 new cases within one day to the institute, down from 6,419 a week earlier. The seven-day incidence on Saturday morning stood at 37.5 nationwide, down from 39.8 on Friday and 66.8 in the previous week. Public holidays have, however, resulted in fewer people seeing a doctor, which means fewer samples are taken and fewer laboratory tests. Therefore, fewer new infections are reported. According to the RKI, 163 new deaths were recorded across Germany within 24 hours. A week ago 170 deaths from the virus were logged. The RKI has counted 3,675,296 Covid-19 infections since the beginning of the pandemic, but the actual total number is likely significantly higher, since many infections are not detected. The Philippines said on Saturday people were allowed to again go to work in Saudi Arabia, reversing a brief deployment ban after the kingdom said they would not be charged for Covid-19 tests and quarantine upon arrival. Reuters reports: “Our Saudi-bound workers will no longer be disadvantaged,” said labour secretary, Silvestre Bello. Flag carrier Philippine Airlines said it would accept Filipino workers on flights to Dammam and Riyadh, waiving rebooking fees for passengers who had been unable to board because of the deployment ban. Bello apologised for the “inconvenience and momentary anguish” caused by his Thursday ban, saying: “I understand that the suspension order drew confusion and irritation among our affected departing overseas Filipino workers.” More than a million Filipinos work in Saudi Arabia, the most preferred destination of overseas Filipino workers in 2019, government data shows. Many Filipinos are hired as construction workers, domestic helpers or nurses. In 2020, Filipinos in Saudi Arabia sent home $1.8bn in remittances, a key support for the consumption-led economy. With more than 1.2 million cases and 20,722 deaths, the Philippines has the second-highest Covid-19 infections and casualties in south-east Asia, behind Indonesia. People should be “very concerned” about the spread of the Indian variant of coronavirus, but “reassured” by the scale of the vaccine rollout, an expert has said. Professor Anthony Harnden, deputy chair of the UK’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), told BBC Breakfast that the variant was “clearly more transmissible”. He said: We need to be reassured that we’re in a very different position now in that we’ve got a highly vaccinated population and we just need to continue moving at speed. We do know that with this particular variant you do need two doses to offer complete protection, and so we’re very, very keen to make sure that all those, particularly higher risk groups, that’s the over-50s and those with underlying illness, receive their second vaccination as soon as feasible. The unlocking of society in England will be a “gradual process” that requires a “cautious” approach even if the government’s target date for removing all legal limits on social contact in the country on 21 June remains in place, he added, emphasising the need to “look very carefully” at what happens with the India variant in the next one or two weeks. He said: I think we need to look at that data very carefully before we completely un-lockdown. He suggested it was “better” to be on “the cautious side”, adding: Even if we do un-lockdown, if you are in a vulnerable position, particularly if you’ve not been vaccinated, you do need to carry on being cautious, even if the 21 June date goes ahead. So I think we’ve all got used to living within boundaries at the moment and I think it’s not an all or none, I think it will be a gradual process even if the 21 June date goes ahead. Scotland’s health secretary Humza Yousaf said there was “significant community transmission” of coronavirus in hotspots in the city of Glasgow. The city will remain under level 3 of Scotland’s restrictions until at least 5 June and Yousaf said urgent work was being carried out to understand the outbreak in south Glasgow and how the India variant arrived. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today: In a few concentrated hotspots ... we are seeing significant community transmission. The levels and the numbers of cases are continuing to rise. In other parts of the country “local health teams tell us they are relatively contained outbreaks” linked to either schools or domestic clusters, but that was not the case in Glasgow. What we are seeing is it’s coming in in areas where there is a large, diverse community so therefore there is a probability the variant has come in from international travel. Therefore we are trying to get to the bottom of how it managed to get in. Victoria state in Australia has recorded five new locally acquired cases of coronavirus, with four linked to a food distribution delivery driver, as the state enters its second day of its fourth lockdown. The update brings the total number of cases from the latest outbreak in Melbourne to 35. A record 56,624 tests were conducted in the 24 hours to Saturday morning, surpassing the previous day’s record of 47,462 tests. On Saturday, the state’s Covid testing commander, Jeroen Weimar, said four of the new cases were linked to a person who tested positive on Friday. The Victorian health minister, Martin Foley, said the person was a food distribution delivery driver who visited “multiple stores and grocery sites across metropolitan Melbourne on 18 and 19 May”. There are now more than 150 exposure sites and more than 15,000 primary and secondary contacts who must self-isolate after coming into potential contact with a person with Covid-19. Foley said the individual “worked during their infectious period” but they “showed no signs of Covid symptoms themselves”. He also thanked the food distribution company and customers for working with contact tracers. Weimar said four of the new cases announced on Saturday were household contacts of the delivery driver, including a student at Mount Ridley college in Craigieburn. He said these four people had only been in isolation for one day. The fifth case was separate, and was an employee of firm Stratton Finance who became infected at a display home in Mickleham. Late on Friday the Victorian health department announced new tier 1 exposure sites – where people are most at risk of catching and spreading the virus. A full list of exposure sites can be found here. Foley announced what he called a “hat-trick of records”, as the state administered a record number of tests and vaccinations over the past three days. Taiwan reported 486 new domestic Covid-19 cases on Saturday, including 166 cases added to the totals for recent days as it continues to readjust its infection numbers following delays in reporting positive tests. After successfully keeping coronavirus at bay, Taiwan is currently in the grip of its first serious outbreak. The island is desperately seeking vaccines to protect its people, and Taiwan’s neighbour China has offered to help, the BBC reported. Up until the mid-May, the country had logged only around 1,500 infections and 12 deaths, before cases began to rise sharply. On Tuesday, health minister Chen Shih-chung announced 2m vaccine doses would arrive in Taiwan in June, and 10m by the end of August. Russia reported 9,289 new Covid-19 cases on Saturday, including 3,241 in Moscow, taking the official national tally since the pandemic began to 5,053,748. The government coronavirus task force said 401 people had died of coronavirus-linked causes in the past 24 hours, pushing the national death toll to 120,807. The federal statistics agency has kept a separate count and has said Russia recorded around 250,000 deaths related to Covid-19 from April 2020 to March 2021. Malaysia reported 9,020 new coronavirus cases on Saturday, the highest daily toll since the start of the pandemic. This is the fifth straight day of record new infections, bringing the total number of cases in the country to 558,534. The country’s prime minister, Muhyiddin Yassin, has announced a nationwide “total lockdown” from 1 to 14 June that will apply to all social and economic areas, with only essential services and economic sectors listed by the national security council remaining in operation, ABC reports. “With the latest rise in daily cases showing a drastically upward trend, hospital capacity across the country to treat Covid-19 patients are becoming limited,” Muhyiddin said in a statement. Prof Stephen Reicher, a psychologist on the UK’s Sage sub-committee advising the government on behavioural science, said “confusion” over the government’s approach was undermining efforts to control the pandemic. Ahead of the planned 21 June easing of restrictions in England, he said the government was in a “pickle” because it appeared to have abandoned the “data, not dates” principle. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today: The data we are seeing at the moment suggests we have a problem. We don’t know how big the problem is - it might be bad, it might be very bad, we will learn in the next week or two. But the problem for the government is: on the one hand it can’t delay what it has been promising for so long, but on the other hand it is aware of the dangers of so doing. And so you see that in the fact that they are beginning to act in a rather contradictory way. They’re saying to us, for instance on travel: ‘you can travel internationally but please don’t’. They say of social contact ‘you can hug, but please don’t hug’. They say of restrictions, ‘no restrictions but please don’t go in and out of the hotspots’. That contradiction, that sense of confusion, I think is undermining the response. Hello and welcome to our global coronavirus live blog. Vietnam health minister Nguyen Thanh Long said on Saturday the country has detected a new variant of the coronavirus, which is a mix of the India and UK Covid-19 variants and spreads quickly by air, online newspaper VnExpress reported. Vietnam’s latest coronavirus wave, which began about a month ago, has seen 3,595 local Covid-19 cases so far in 33 cities and provinces. He said the coronavirus responsible for the new wave is much more transmissible, especially in the air. Viral cultures in the laboratory revealed that the virus replicated itself very quickly, he added, explaining why there are so many new cases in different locations in a shorter time frame. So far, Vietnam has recorded the presence of seven coronavirus variants, including ones from the UK, India and South Africa.

Caution is needed in determining whether England’s coronavirus restrictions can be lifted next month or “things will get bad very, very quickly”, a professor whose argument against herd immunity helped trigger the first lockdown has warned. Sir Tim Gowers, a professor of mathematics at the University of Cambridge, told the Guardian the downside of being “a bit more cautious” was a lot smaller than the downside of getting it wrong, as UK Covid cases rose by 4,184 on Friday – the highest increase since 1 April. Asked about the next step in lockdown easing in England, due on June 21, Prof Gowers said he did not believe the plans were necessarily at risk, but urged caution. He said: Because Boris Johnson has made a big thing about all the steps being irreversible, I think he’s put himself in a position where once he takes a step, he’ll be extremely reluctant to reverse because that would be a big U-turn, an embarrassing climbdown. So I think if that’s the way you’re going to play things, then you should be very, very cautious about every step you take ... And maybe everything [will] be OK, maybe the number of people who are vaccinated will be just enough ... ‘R’ will broadly speaking stay below one even with Indian variants. But if it’s not OK, we know, because of mathematics, that things will get bad very, very quickly. Or at least, maybe it won’t look that quick to start with, but it’ll grow exponentially. So it’ll pick up speed and become a big problem. Read my colleague Ben Quinn’s full story here. Prof Christina Pagel, a member of Independent Sage from University College London, said reopening should be delayed a few more months.","charCount":"18761","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/jedidajah-otte\">Jedidajah Otte</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2021/may/29/health-experts-urge-caution-on-giving-covid-vaccines-to-uk-children","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-29T10:22:00Z","webTitle":"Health experts urge caution on giving Covid vaccines to UK  children ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/may/29/health-experts-urge-caution-on-giving-covid-vaccines-to-uk-children","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2021/may/29/health-experts-urge-caution-on-giving-covid-vaccines-to-uk-children","fields":{"headline":"Health experts urge caution on giving Covid vaccines to UK  children ","standfirst":"<p>As the US and Europe approve plans to immunise teenagers, scientists in Britain advise delay</p>","trailText":"As the US and Europe approve plans to immunise teenagers, scientists in Britain advise delay","byline":"Robin McKie","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3d0a8a454dcffecec78912992744e353b4bb54a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d0a8a454dcffecec78912992744e353b4bb54a1/0_117_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A healthcare worker prepares a dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Authorities in the UK want to gather more information on possible side effects from giving the jab to youngsters.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlos Osorio/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Launching a programme of Covid-19 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/02/nhs-england-draws-up-plan-to-give-covid-jabs-to-children-12-and-over\" title=\"\">immunisations for children</a> should be considered only in special circumstances, leading health experts have warned.</p> <p>They say UK medical authorities, who are currently studying how vaccines for adolescents might be administered, should move with great care over the implementation of such a programme.</p> <p>They acknowledge it could help reduce outbreaks and the spread of Covid but also warn it could also raise important practical and ethical problems.

Next month, the Pentagon will deliver to Congress a long-awaited report on its research into what the military calls unidentified aerial phenomena but the rest of the world calls UFOs. Ever since the New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/16/us/politics/pentagon-program-ufo-harry-reid.html\">reported</a> the existence of a $22m Pentagon program dedicated to studying reported sightings of UFOs by military personnel – along with startling videos of the phenomenon – a steady stream of leaks have followed. Senators from Harry Reid to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/17/ufo-report-marco-rubio-urges-us-take-seriously-uap\">Marco Rubio</a> have weighed in, demanding the issue be taken seriously. Now even Barack Obama has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/20/ufo-obama-cbs-60-minutes-america-aliens\">said</a> that for years the government has been seeing flying objects that “we can’t explain”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/29/ufos-uap-america-pentagon-report\">‘From hearsay to hard evidence’: are UFOs about to go mainstream?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A society’s reaction to things it can’t explain always tell us more about the society than about the thing itself. And so far, the reaction has been remarkably muted. Perhaps the simplest explanation for the relative shrug with which these latest revelations have been met is that many Americans already believe the most radical explanation for them. According to one poll, two-thirds of Americans <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/alien-intelligent-life-other-planets/\">believe</a> there is intelligent life on other planets, 56% believe that we have already made contact with them or will within 100 years, and over half believe UFOs might be alien spacecraft. Polls have shown <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/US/9706/15/ufo.poll/\">similar results</a> – albeit with high sensitivity to how the question is phrased – for decades.</p> <p>Despite the enormous metaphysical and spiritual consequences which would flow from them, few people organize their lives around these beliefs. Those dedicated “ufologists” who do so are widely mocked. As America’s response to the coronavirus has shown, many people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/22/america-covid-deaths-coronavirus-culture\">have trouble</a> reckoning with the moral implications of the existence of other human beings, much less other sentient species. The topics which absorb the country’s political and media elites are much more immediate and visceral. If the shapes in the sky have a position on abortion, gun rights or Mitch McConnell, they haven’t yet made them known. Until they do, their relevance to the news cycle will remain limited.</p> <p>Some commentators, though, <em>have</em> already dared to go where (almost) no commentator has gone before, and in doing so they are revealing of our political moment. The liberal writer Ezra Klein, for instance, has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/13/opinion/ufos-aliens-space.html\">hoped</a> for a unifying moment, the kind which happens in science fiction when first contact with an alien species is followed by humanity putting aside its differences. But, like American society, science fiction has been changing in ways which show how stifling and artificial such moments can be.</p> <p>Science fiction has always been a sort of magical mirror in which we see what we want our own species to be, or conversely fear that it will become. A genre which used to consist largely of strong white men standing united against alien hordes is also home to authors such as <a href=\"https://www.otherscribbles.com/\">Becky Chambers</a>, <a href=\"https://annleckie.com/\">Ann Leckie</a> and Octavia Butler, whose fiction highlights the variety of human identity and relationships – sexual, gendered, class-based and racial. These different perspectives reveal how politically and culturally divisive a real first contact would be. Observers would rifle through the evidence (What is the alien’s family and economic structure? Do they believe in God?) to find validation for their own values, and as a cudgel to use against those of others. The fracturing of modern identity and the understanding that consensus often hides oppression makes unifying moments hard to imagine in even the most extreme of circumstances, liberal hopes notwithstanding.</p> <p>On the right, Christian writers and thinkers have made <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/23/opinion/alien-encounters-christmas-ufo.html\">a subtle claim</a> for the superiority of their own worldview in interpreting the phenomenon. Some Christians argue that nothing in their faith precludes the existence of alien beings, and that Christianity may even welcome such beings on to the path to redemption. But more revealing of views on the right is Tucker Carlson’s recent intervention in the debate, in which he <a href=\"Tucker%20Carlson%20has%20already%20weighed%20in,%20accusing%20the%20Pentagon%20of\">blasted</a> the Pentagon for taking diversity issues more seriously than the threat of UFOs. This reminds us that sections of American Christianity – especially white evangelical Protestantism – are often as much about identitarian nationalism as they are about religious faith. Groups who were <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/10/30/18035336/white-evangelicals-immigration-nationalism-christianity-refugee-honduras-migrant\">the most supportive</a> of a crackdown on refugees and other humans they consider “aliens” might feel differently about actual aliens. But is it likely?</p> <p>Indeed, most of society seems ready to view UFOs as primarily a security threat to which a response by the military is required.

Next month, the Pentagon will deliver to Congress a long-awaited report on its research into what the military calls unidentified aerial phenomena but the rest of the world calls UFOs. Ever since the New York Times reported the existence of a $22m Pentagon program dedicated to studying reported sightings of UFOs by military personnel – along with startling videos of the phenomenon – a steady stream of leaks have followed. Senators from Harry Reid to Marco Rubio have weighed in, demanding the issue be taken seriously. Now even Barack Obama has said that for years the government has been seeing flying objects that “we can’t explain”. A society’s reaction to things it can’t explain always tell us more about the society than about the thing itself. And so far, the reaction has been remarkably muted. Perhaps the simplest explanation for the relative shrug with which these latest revelations have been met is that many Americans already believe the most radical explanation for them. According to one poll, two-thirds of Americans believe there is intelligent life on other planets, 56% believe that we have already made contact with them or will within 100 years, and over half believe UFOs might be alien spacecraft. Polls have shown similar results – albeit with high sensitivity to how the question is phrased – for decades. Despite the enormous metaphysical and spiritual consequences which would flow from them, few people organize their lives around these beliefs. Those dedicated “ufologists” who do so are widely mocked. As America’s response to the coronavirus has shown, many people have trouble reckoning with the moral implications of the existence of other human beings, much less other sentient species. The topics which absorb the country’s political and media elites are much more immediate and visceral. If the shapes in the sky have a position on abortion, gun rights or Mitch McConnell, they haven’t yet made them known. Until they do, their relevance to the news cycle will remain limited. Some commentators, though, have already dared to go where (almost) no commentator has gone before, and in doing so they are revealing of our political moment. The liberal writer Ezra Klein, for instance, has hoped for a unifying moment, the kind which happens in science fiction when first contact with an alien species is followed by humanity putting aside its differences. But, like American society, science fiction has been changing in ways which show how stifling and artificial such moments can be. Science fiction has always been a sort of magical mirror in which we see what we want our own species to be, or conversely fear that it will become. A genre which used to consist largely of strong white men standing united against alien hordes is also home to authors such as Becky Chambers, Ann Leckie and Octavia Butler, whose fiction highlights the variety of human identity and relationships – sexual, gendered, class-based and racial. These different perspectives reveal how politically and culturally divisive a real first contact would be. Observers would rifle through the evidence (What is the alien’s family and economic structure? Do they believe in God?) to find validation for their own values, and as a cudgel to use against those of others. The fracturing of modern identity and the understanding that consensus often hides oppression makes unifying moments hard to imagine in even the most extreme of circumstances, liberal hopes notwithstanding. On the right, Christian writers and thinkers have made a subtle claim for the superiority of their own worldview in interpreting the phenomenon. Some Christians argue that nothing in their faith precludes the existence of alien beings, and that Christianity may even welcome such beings on to the path to redemption. But more revealing of views on the right is Tucker Carlson’s recent intervention in the debate, in which he blasted the Pentagon for taking diversity issues more seriously than the threat of UFOs. This reminds us that sections of American Christianity – especially white evangelical Protestantism – are often as much about identitarian nationalism as they are about religious faith. Groups who were the most supportive of a crackdown on refugees and other humans they consider “aliens” might feel differently about actual aliens. But is it likely? Indeed, most of society seems ready to view UFOs as primarily a security threat to which a response by the military is required. This not only says something about the human psyche, but it comes at a cost for understanding the phenomenon. It stifles the free flow of information. It also means that those at the heart of the investigation are predisposed towards certain kinds of questions. The narrow matter of whether UFOs represent a national security risk is worth investigating, but it hardly exhausts what we need to know. A world in which most curiosity is snickered or shrugged at while the military monopolizes serious research is one with its priorities out of balance. We shouldn’t expect the Pentagon report to provide proof of life on other worlds. But that doesn’t mean it is useless, or that it should be ignored by even the most ardent of skeptics.

Eight of the league’s top 10 clubs have said farewell to their managers, including the newly-crowned champions and the team they just deposed.</p> <p>Juventus’s decision <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/may/28/andrea-pirlo-no-regrets-juventus-sack-him-allegri-manager\">to move on from Andrea Pirlo</a> came as no surprise. The winners of the previous nine Scudetti could not content themselves with barely scraping into the top four. Antonio Conte’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/may/26/antonio-conte-leaving-inter-over-plan-to-sell-80m-of-players\">separation from Inter</a> was another matter. After Inter raised the Coppa Campioni d’Italia on Sunday, the club president, Steven Zhang, had told reporters that their success was “most of all thanks to him”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/may/03/inter-serie-a-title-win-antonio-conte-italian-football\">Conte overthrows Juve’s kingdom to restore Inter to Serie A pinnacle | Nicky Bandini</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet Inter could not escape their financial reality. They posted losses of more than €100m on last season’s accounts and, thanks to Covid, the numbers are expected to look even bleaker next time. Conte wanted Inter to invest and build on their first domestic title in 11 years. He was told instead that the wage bill needs to come down by 20%, and that the club intends to raise close to €100m from player sales.</p> <p>That was more than he could countenance. It was an unwelcome shock, too, for fans who had celebrated outside San Siro, mobbing Zhang’s car on Sunday and letting him know “there’s only one president”. Ultras from the Curva Nord raised a banner outside Inter’s headquarters on Wednesday with a different message: “Zhang, take hold of your responsibilities or leave our city.”</p> <p>Uncertainty and intrigue lie ahead, as the managerial merry-go-round spins into overdrive. But before we consign the 2020-21 season to the history books, we should commemorate the best of it as well. This was a remarkable campaign, and not only for the fact that it brought down the curtain on Juventus’s dominant run.</p> <p>There were times, at the outset, when it seemed unlikely that Serie A could get through a season at all. Napoli were grounded by local health authorities as they prepared to travel for an away game against Juventus in October. In a spectacle that only looks more absurd with the passing of time, their opponents continued to pretend it was business as usual <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/05/juventus-napoli-covid-no-show-serie-a-covid-court\">right up to the last moment</a>, even posting a team-sheet on Twitter. Yet football found a way through. For all the challenges and complications off the pitch, this would turn out to be a fascinating season on it.</p> <p>Juventus’s decision to promote on Pirlo, the man they had appointed to his first professional coaching position, in charge of their under-23 team, just nine days before, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/aug/15/andrea-pirlos-vineyard-is-not-a-reason-to-think-he-will-be-a-vintage-manager\">was always a gamble</a>, but few would have predicted that it could end with the <em>Bianconeri</em> relying on other clubs to help them qualify for the Champions League by the final weekend. At the outset, there had even been some optimism. Cristiano Ronaldo described the working environment as “better, happier” than it had been under Maurizio Sarri. “We work smiling,” he said in September.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4f6fa55cb4385b0116d1c70dab1d742ea2ecc825\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f6fa55cb4385b0116d1c70dab1d742ea2ecc825/0_0_3600_2411/1000.jpg\" alt=\"It was a season to forget for Andrea Pirlo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"670\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">It was a season to forget for Andrea Pirlo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Isabella Bonotto/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Those were not enough to sustain Juventus as they started to drop points to the likes of Crotone, Benevento and Verona. Ronaldo kept on setting records, finishing as Serie A’s <em>capocannoniere</em> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2021/mar/15/cristiano-ronaldo-embraces-perfection-hat-trick-declares-himself-ahead-of-pele-juventus-serie-a\">perhaps the leading scorer of all time</a> (it depends who’s counting) but went missing when his team needed him most in the Champions League against Porto.</p> <p>At first it seemed as though Milan might dethrone them, a team that lasted 304 days without a league defeat – from March 2020 all the way through to January 2021. Zlatan Ibrahimovic was <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CGdGD0HnzCc/\">a hungry lion</a>, but his 39-year-old body could not sustain the rigours of a full season. As he went to sing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2021/mar/04/zlatan-ibrahimovic-sanremo-music-festival-ac-milan-serie-a-napoli-sassuolo\">at the Sanremo Music Festival</a>, the young squad he left behind suffered a bout of stage-fright.</p> <p>Inter overtook them, as was inevitable with a team that never put a foot wrong after finding its stride. From late-January through to mid-May, they dropped four points in 17 games. The title race became a procession, but Serie A still had plenty of drama to offer. Atalanta <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/jan/26/sevilla-sign-alejandro-papu-gomez-from-atalanta-in-cut-price-deal\">parted ways with their captain</a>, Papu Gómez, only for others to step forward – Luis Muriel, Ruslan Malinkovskiy and Robin Gosens carrying them into the Champions League for the third consecutive season. Napoli blasted into the top four with 11 goals in a week, only to collapse on the final night.</p> <p>As always, there were compelling narratives away from the top. Cesare Prandelli returned to Fiorentina after a decade away, only to step down within five months, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/mar/23/a-dark-cloud-inside-of-me-prandelli-steps-down-as-fiorentina-manager\">citing “a dark cloud inside me”</a>. This was not the happy tale anyone had wished for him, yet he had led the Viola to a famous 3-0 win at Juventus and helped unleash the talent of Dusan Vlahovic, the 21-year-old striker who would finish the season with 21 goals.</p> <p>Benevento faded down the stretch and ultimately were relegated, but not before Roberto Insigne had the chance to score his first Serie A goal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/26/insigne-brothers-trade-goals-roberto-gets-moment-against-napoli-benevento-serie-a\">while playing against his brother Lorenzo</a>.

His Inter squad was packed with talent, but also with players who had never won before. None of the group he leaned upon most heavily – Lukaku, De Vrij, Lautaro Martínez, Samir Handanovic, Barella, Bastoni, Milan Skriniar, Marcelo Brozovic or even Achraf Hakimi – had ever conquered one of Europe’s top five leagues.</p> <p>For all the <a href=\"https://sempreinter.com/2020/12/10/fabio-capello-inter-played-to-win-but-without-the-necessary-anger-needed-to-win/\">embarrassing bickering with Fabio Capello</a>, Conte showed he could indeed come up with a plan B, adjusting a team that conceded 23 times in its first 17 games so that it would give up just six in the next 17 – abandoning the use of a No 10 and restoring Skriniar to the back three. When financial constraints stopped Inter investing in the January transfer window, he integrated Christian Eriksen and Ivan Perisic into new roles and got both playing brilliantly.</p> <p>This is a <em>scudetto</em>, and perhaps an entire season, in his image: the man who launched Juventus’s decade of domination coming back to end it. Even so, I’m struggling to weigh his work against those of others who operating under drastically different circumstances.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fca6496f29d57ade8a812435e23a468d9662ebc7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fca6496f29d57ade8a812435e23a468d9662ebc7/0_0_4986_3324/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Conte and his Inter players.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Conte and his Inter players.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Calanni/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Stefano Pioli might not have sustained Milan’s title push, but to steer them back into the Champions League with the youngest starting XIs in all of Serie A, and with his only reliable centre-forward, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, absent for 19 games, is still hugely impressive. So too is Gian Piero Gasperini guiding Atalanta into the top four for a third consecutive season.</p> <p>And what about Vincenzo Italiano at Spezia, whose three seasons of professional club management have seen him promote Trapani from Serie C, then Spezia from Serie B and now keep the latter club in the top flight?</p> <p>Any of the above coaches would make a fitting winner for me so I’m not even going to choose. They can squabble among themselves.</p> <h2><strong>Player of the season</strong></h2> <p>There are lots of deserving candidates here, too, but I’m giving the award to Lukaku. Not just for his goals (though 24 is a good number) nor the assists (11 – second-most) but for his presence on the pitch, the way he would drag Inter forward in the fraught moments, imposing himself on defenders so forcefully that his teammates had no choice but to follow.</p> <p>Lukaku rose to the occasion in defining games, scoring in all three Milan derbies – including the Coppa Italia quarter-final when Ibrahimovic butted him and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/jan/27/the-fiver-zlatan-ibrahimovic-romelu-lukaku-and-some-serious-verbals\">provoked with comments about his mother</a>. The Belgian built a connection with supporters even in empty stadiums, because they could tell how much he was invested in the objective of becoming a champion for the first time.</p> <p>After Inter finally sealed the <em>Scudetto</em>, Lukaku sang terrace chants out of the window of his apartment before going for a ride around town, standing with his head out of the sunroof so he could <a href=\"https://twitter.com/marifcinter/status/1388903341191798786\">join in celebrations with supporters.</a> His season was commemorated in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/footballitalia/status/1361028477781237766\">not one</a> but <a href=\"https://twitter.com/leonardgrn/status/1387402610156707841)\">two</a> murals outside San Siro: a fitting recognition of his most prominent role.</p> <h2><strong>Most memorable celebration</strong></h2> <p>“I’m the fucking best! Me! Me! I told you!” – Lukaku’s roar after scoring the final goal in February’s 3-0 rout of Milan might not have been heard under normal circumstances, with a crowd of 80,000 to drown it out.

Eight of the league’s top 10 clubs have said farewell to their managers, including the newly-crowned champions and the team they just deposed. Juventus’s decision to move on from Andrea Pirlo came as no surprise. The winners of the previous nine Scudetti could not content themselves with barely scraping into the top four. Antonio Conte’s separation from Inter was another matter. After Inter raised the Coppa Campioni d’Italia on Sunday, the club president, Steven Zhang, had told reporters that their success was “most of all thanks to him”. Yet Inter could not escape their financial reality. They posted losses of more than €100m on last season’s accounts and, thanks to Covid, the numbers are expected to look even bleaker next time. Conte wanted Inter to invest and build on their first domestic title in 11 years. He was told instead that the wage bill needs to come down by 20%, and that the club intends to raise close to €100m from player sales. That was more than he could countenance. It was an unwelcome shock, too, for fans who had celebrated outside San Siro, mobbing Zhang’s car on Sunday and letting him know “there’s only one president”. Ultras from the Curva Nord raised a banner outside Inter’s headquarters on Wednesday with a different message: “Zhang, take hold of your responsibilities or leave our city.” Uncertainty and intrigue lie ahead, as the managerial merry-go-round spins into overdrive. But before we consign the 2020-21 season to the history books, we should commemorate the best of it as well. This was a remarkable campaign, and not only for the fact that it brought down the curtain on Juventus’s dominant run. There were times, at the outset, when it seemed unlikely that Serie A could get through a season at all. Napoli were grounded by local health authorities as they prepared to travel for an away game against Juventus in October. In a spectacle that only looks more absurd with the passing of time, their opponents continued to pretend it was business as usual right up to the last moment, even posting a team-sheet on Twitter. Yet football found a way through. For all the challenges and complications off the pitch, this would turn out to be a fascinating season on it. Juventus’s decision to promote on Pirlo, the man they had appointed to his first professional coaching position, in charge of their under-23 team, just nine days before, was always a gamble, but few would have predicted that it could end with the Bianconeri relying on other clubs to help them qualify for the Champions League by the final weekend. At the outset, there had even been some optimism. Cristiano Ronaldo described the working environment as “better, happier” than it had been under Maurizio Sarri. “We work smiling,” he said in September. Those were not enough to sustain Juventus as they started to drop points to the likes of Crotone, Benevento and Verona. Ronaldo kept on setting records, finishing as Serie A’s capocannoniere and perhaps the leading scorer of all time (it depends who’s counting) but went missing when his team needed him most in the Champions League against Porto. At first it seemed as though Milan might dethrone them, a team that lasted 304 days without a league defeat – from March 2020 all the way through to January 2021. Zlatan Ibrahimovic was a hungry lion, but his 39-year-old body could not sustain the rigours of a full season. As he went to sing at the Sanremo Music Festival, the young squad he left behind suffered a bout of stage-fright. Inter overtook them, as was inevitable with a team that never put a foot wrong after finding its stride. From late-January through to mid-May, they dropped four points in 17 games. The title race became a procession, but Serie A still had plenty of drama to offer. Atalanta parted ways with their captain, Papu Gómez, only for others to step forward – Luis Muriel, Ruslan Malinkovskiy and Robin Gosens carrying them into the Champions League for the third consecutive season. Napoli blasted into the top four with 11 goals in a week, only to collapse on the final night. As always, there were compelling narratives away from the top. Cesare Prandelli returned to Fiorentina after a decade away, only to step down within five months, citing “a dark cloud inside me”. This was not the happy tale anyone had wished for him, yet he had led the Viola to a famous 3-0 win at Juventus and helped unleash the talent of Dusan Vlahovic, the 21-year-old striker who would finish the season with 21 goals. Benevento faded down the stretch and ultimately were relegated, but not before Roberto Insigne had the chance to score his first Serie A goal while playing against his brother Lorenzo. Crotone, another team heading back down to Serie B, played some wildly entertaining football after the improbable appointment of Serse Cosmi. There is far more to say about this season than I will ever manage here, from the Super League saga to Christian Vieri’s Twitch channel and the 24 penalties required in a shoot-out with Rio Ave just for Milan to reach the Europa League group stage. So without further ado, let’s get down to the important business … Goal of the season 7) It’s not the most beautiful of the bunch, but for scoring quicker than anybody has before in a Serie A match (and via a pre-rehearsed move) Rafael Leão belongs on this list. 6) Carles Pérez goes for a stroll. 5) “Alexa, show me Roberto De Zerbi’s footballing ideal.” 4) Koffi Djidji pioneering the no-look, over-the-shoulder chip. 3) I can’t pick between these volleys, so have all of them: Henrikh Mkhitaryan from 30 yards, Giacomo Bonaventura teeing himself up, Ciro Immobile somehow scoring from the wrong side of a defender and Federico Dimarco with a strike that feels like it was stolen from a Roy of the Rovers comic. 2) There were some outrageous overhead goals in Serie A this season, too, from Zlatan Ibrahimovic to Graziano Pellè and Verona’s Mattia Zaccagni … 1) … but Daniele Verde’s effort for Spezia against Lazio, struck first-time and kissing the post on its way into the top corner, was the pick of the bunch. ASMR goal of the season I am no fan of empty, quiet, stadiums, but the sound of Borja Mayoral’s shot hitting the top corner against Crotone is just so perfectly satisfying. Best way to seal your first-ever hat-trick Vlahovic. Best goal that nobody saw If the TV audience could scarcely make out Vlad Chiriches lining his shot up from 25 yards, what hope did Salvatore Sirigu have? Best tribute Lorenzo Insigne, wearing the colours of Argentina and scoring a beautiful free-kick in Napoli’s first game following the death of Diego Maradona, at a stadium renamed to honour the club’s greatest player. Assist of the season Insigne again, winning the ball in his own half and beating the same three Fiorentina players twice each before teeing up Hirving Lozano at the back post. Honourable mentions: Rodrigo De Paul, Luis Muriel and Soualiho Meïté. Dishonourable mention: Theo Hernández. Team of the season (3-5-2): Gianluigi Donnarumma; Alessandro Bastoni, Stefan De Vrij, Cristian Romero; Lorenzo Insigne, Ruslan Malinovskiy, Rodrigo De Paul, Franck Kessié, Domenico Berardi; Romelu Lukaku, Cristiano Ronaldo. Manager of the season Conte would be an obvious pick, and a deserving one. His Inter squad was packed with talent, but also with players who had never won before. None of the group he leaned upon most heavily – Lukaku, De Vrij, Lautaro Martínez, Samir Handanovic, Barella, Bastoni, Milan Skriniar, Marcelo Brozovic or even Achraf Hakimi – had ever conquered one of Europe’s top five leagues. For all the embarrassing bickering with Fabio Capello, Conte showed he could indeed come up with a plan B, adjusting a team that conceded 23 times in its first 17 games so that it would give up just six in the next 17 – abandoning the use of a No 10 and restoring Skriniar to the back three. When financial constraints stopped Inter investing in the January transfer window, he integrated Christian Eriksen and Ivan Perisic into new roles and got both playing brilliantly. This is a scudetto, and perhaps an entire season, in his image: the man who launched Juventus’s decade of domination coming back to end it. Even so, I’m struggling to weigh his work against those of others who operating under drastically different circumstances. Stefano Pioli might not have sustained Milan’s title push, but to steer them back into the Champions League with the youngest starting XIs in all of Serie A, and with his only reliable centre-forward, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, absent for 19 games, is still hugely impressive. So too is Gian Piero Gasperini guiding Atalanta into the top four for a third consecutive season. And what about Vincenzo Italiano at Spezia, whose three seasons of professional club management have seen him promote Trapani from Serie C, then Spezia from Serie B and now keep the latter club in the top flight? Any of the above coaches would make a fitting winner for me so I’m not even going to choose. They can squabble among themselves. Player of the season There are lots of deserving candidates here, too, but I’m giving the award to Lukaku. Not just for his goals (though 24 is a good number) nor the assists (11 – second-most) but for his presence on the pitch, the way he would drag Inter forward in the fraught moments, imposing himself on defenders so forcefully that his teammates had no choice but to follow. Lukaku rose to the occasion in defining games, scoring in all three Milan derbies – including the Coppa Italia quarter-final when Ibrahimovic butted him and provoked with comments about his mother. The Belgian built a connection with supporters even in empty stadiums, because they could tell how much he was invested in the objective of becoming a champion for the first time. After Inter finally sealed the Scudetto, Lukaku sang terrace chants out of the window of his apartment before going for a ride around town, standing with his head out of the sunroof so he could join in celebrations with supporters. His season was commemorated in not one but two murals outside San Siro: a fitting recognition of his most prominent role. Most memorable celebration “I’m the fucking best! Me! Me! I told you!” – Lukaku’s roar after scoring the final goal in February’s 3-0 rout of Milan might not have been heard under normal circumstances, with a crowd of 80,000 to drown it out. As it was, it felt like the moment when a victory over a rival became something more: a statement about where the title was headed. Most intimate celebration “When you’re celebrating, anything can happen,” said Spezia’s Giulio Maggiore, after Ricky Saponara pulled down his shorts and spanked him on live television. Most haunted by VAR By November, Álvaro Morata had tallied 13 disallowed goals in the calendar year – and six of those at Juventus. “If I wore a size 43 shoe instead of a 45, it would be a lot fewer,” he lamented. The following week, he had another one chalked off in a Nations League game against Germany. Honourable mention: Sassuolo’s Ciccio Caputo had three goals disallowed during a match against Spezia in September. The Neroverdi still won 4-1. Best mindgames “Don’t worry,” shouted Sinisa Mihajlovic as Ibrahimovic lined up to take a penalty against Bologna. “He doesn’t know how to hit them.” The striker’s shot was duly saved by Lukasz Skorupski. Though, Ante Rebic did score the rebound. Best micro-management Simone Inzaghi, physically pushing Adam Marusic to get him facing the right way for a throw-in that would lead to a 95th-minute equaliser against Juventus. Best meme Antonio Conte v Lautaro Martínez. Best beauty advice “You don’t always need to see Brad Pitt when you look in the mirror. Sometimes you need to be Calimero: a little bit ugly and dirty” – Gennaro Gattuso. Shortest memory Conte, proudly describing Inter’s win over Atalanta in March as a “mature performance, we didn’t even pick up a single yellow card”, right before De Vrij interrupted him to point out: “Actually we did get one, boss. Yours.” Quote of the season Marco Giampaolo did not get a lot right, in short time in charge of Torino, but his words when asked to compare the Turin derby with those in Genoa and Milan stayed with me: I have no means by which to measure it … The derby is something you breathe from the Monday morning right through to the game on Sunday: you perceive it through the interactions you have with people in your daily life. Right now, that is impossible. Alternative quote of the season “Football is not made up of objective facts” – Crotone’s Serse Cosmi, who proved as much during three wild months in which their 6ft 6in striker Simy became one of the most prolific players in Europe. Worst way to watch a game Sat next to your brother, the Inter manager, while he serves a touchline ban and you wear the only means of communicating with the dugout. Best mum Monica Bastoni, parent of the Inter defender Alessandro, cleaning his face with a tissue as he ate pizza during the team’s title celebration at San Siro. Best admonishment Conte finally losing patience with Arturo Vidal, whose petulant red card against Real Madrid had contributed to Inter’s early Champions League exit, after the Chilean gave away a similarly needless penalty against Crotone. “Gioca e non rompere il cazzo!” he screamed, twice, after the latter blunder, words picked up loud and clear on the TV feed: “Play football and stop breaking dick.” Most concerned The Cagliari ballboy standing right behind the goal when Lukaku’s shot looked like it might burst it.

After it closed early due to the pandemic, Rickson and producer Sonia Friedman reunited most of the cast for this innovative filmed version. Each performance rings true – from Toby Jones in the title role to Aimee Lou Wood’s Sonya, Richard Armitage’s Astrov and the always excellent Rosalind Eleazar as Yelena. And Bruno Poet’s lighting and Rae Smith’s set design combine to spellbinding effect. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000qplz\">On BBC iPlayer</a>.</p> <h2>Earwig</h2> <p>With the stage out of bounds, theatre-makers are devising ever more creative sonic experiments to be enjoyed at home.

This piece of puzzle theatre invites audiences to crack clues with strangers – or you can arrange a private show to team up with your pals.

Hannah Khalil has created new versions of the tales of Pandora, Persephone, King Midas and Theseus and the Minotaur. They’re intended for those aged three to eight but will appeal to older viewers, too.

We Have a Plan</a>.</p> <h2>Shipwreck</h2> <p>First staged at the Almeida in 2019, Shipwreck by Anne “Mr Burns” Washburn gave a sprawling account of modern-day American politics and the rise and potential fall of Trump. It was due to be staged at the Public theatre in New York in 2020 but was instead adapted by Saheem Ali as a <a href=\"https://publictheater.org/productions/season/fall-2020/shipwreck/\">three-part audio play</a> in a co-production with Woolly Mammoth theatre company. Set during a getaway for a bunch of friends in upstate New York in 2017, it’s a knotty appraisal of an American moment that, strikingly, already feels like a vanishing era.</p> <h2>What the Constitution Means to Me</h2> <p>Heidi Schreck’s phenomenal Broadway show has received <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/oct/20/what-the-constitution-means-to-me-review-dazzling-shocking-america-indictment\">five-star reviews</a> from Guardian critics on both sides of the Atlantic.

Do all those tweets and posts endure for eternity – and who decides? The site-specific theatre company Dante or Die asked such questions, and many more, in a thoughtful and funny 2018 show by Chris Goode that was staged in cafes. It has now been reimagined as a 50-minute video podcast, available from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/aug/24/this-digital-afterlife-mobile-phone-based-show-connects-us-in-our-grief-user-not-found-dante-or-die\">the Guardian</a> until 31 March 2022.</p> <h2>Flight Paths</h2> <p>This production by the theatre company Extant celebrates the rich history of Goze, itinerant blind performers who traditionally travelled around Japan to bring audiences a vast selection of stories – accompanied by music played on their shamisen stringed instruments. <a href=\"https://flightpaths.extant.org.uk/\">Flight Paths</a> fuses old and new, bringing together archive material about the Goze, animation and filmed modern performance, in an accessible hour-long digital experience.</p> <h2>good dog</h2> <p>Arinzé Kene’s poetic 2017 play good dog posed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/feb/09/arinze-kene-play-good-dog-uk-riots-2011-interview\">unanswered questions</a> about the UK’s summer riots of 2011.

Anton Cross stars as a man looking back on his youth, his neighbours and his community. The film was commissioned by The Space and supported by the BBC and Arts Council England.</p> <h2>Charlotte Holmes: Adventure Box</h2> <p>Lockdown restrictions and cancelled travel plans have narrowed horizons for little adventurers. So this “seven-day theatrical experience” for families is both a delight and a relief. Created by Huddersfield’s <a href=\"https://thelbt.org/get-involved/charlotte-holmes/\">Lawrence Batley theatre</a>, <a href=\"https://dukeslancaster.org/charlotte-holmes-adventure-box\">the Dukes in Lancaster</a> and theatre producers <a href=\"https://www.thebigtiny.co.uk/\">the Big Tiny</a>, it’s a series of mysteries encountered by Charlotte, a young girl evacuated to Yorkshire during the second world war. You solve the puzzles by watching jaunty online videos and opening up the envelopes and parcels inside an adventure box sent to you in the post when you book. The Big Tiny’s follow-up, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/jan/05/balthazar-snapdragon-adventure-box-review-magical-distractions\">Balthazar Snapdragon</a>, is just as fun. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/aug/12/charlotte-holmes-adventure-box-review\">Read the full review</a>.</p> <h2>Hamilton</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8e2580bb72a3440eb4647dafec9053347db34367\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e2580bb72a3440eb4647dafec9053347db34367/0_6_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lin-Manuel Miranda and Phillipa Soo in Hamilton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lin-Manuel Miranda and Phillipa Soo in Hamilton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lin-Manuel Miranda’s phenomenal, Pulitzer prize-winning musical about the “10-dollar founding father without a father” was filmed over three nights in New York in 2016 with the original Broadway cast.

Adjoa Andoh stars as Richard and co-directs, with Lynette Linton, a superb cast entirely comprising women of colour including Shobna Gulati and Ayesha Dharker.

Its growing collection of short films is designed to offer audiences “hope and joy”. There’s Brian Cox as Ian Rankin’s Edinburgh detective John Rebus, Two Doors Down’s Jonathan Watson as a shipyard electrician suffering from exposure to asbestos, and Kate Dickie as brilliant as ever in a monologue by Jenni Fagan. The lineup of Scottish talent is extraordinary – Tam Dean Burn, Rona Munro and Douglas Henshall all contribute – and don’t miss Janey Godley’s two-hander with her adorable sausage dog. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/may/27/scenes-for-survival-review-brian-cox-zoom-inspector-rebus-national-theatre-of-scotland\">Read the full review</a>.</p> <h2>Matthew Bourne’s The Red Shoes</h2> <p>One of the major dance productions cut short by the coronavirus crisis was Matthew Bourne’s tour of The Red Shoes, his rapturously received version of the Powell and Pressburger film.

Scott performed the play at the Bush in 2008 and it was a hot ticket when he reprised it at the Old Vic 10 years later. This version was shot in a single take in 2011. Directed by Stephens and Andrew Porter, it is available <a href=\"http://www.seawallandrewscott.com/buy-sea-wall-film-starring-andrew-scott/\">online to buy</a>. Brace yourself.</p> <h2>I Wish I Was a Mountain</h2> <p>With wonder, wit and sophisticated storytelling, performance poet Toby Thompson creates a beautiful show for over-sevens. Thompson steps in and out of his version of Hermann Hesse’s fairytale Faldum, riffing with the young audience and spinning a handful of jazz LPs. <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/401349317\">I Wish I Was a Mountain</a> embraces big questions about time and contentment. This is a short but profound show, directed by Lee Lyford, hatched by the Egg theatre’s <a href=\"https://www.theatreroyal.org.uk/take-part/artist-development/about/\">Incubator</a> development programme and cleverly designed by Anisha Fields. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/sep/24/i-wish-i-was-a-mountain-review-toby-thompson-hermann-hesse-the-egg-bath\">Read the full review</a>.</p> <h2>Lyric theatre in Belfast</h2> <p>Belfast’s Lyric had to cancel its co-production of 1984 with Bruiser Theatre Company but instead launched the initiative New Speak: Re-imagined, in which Northern Irish talents including Amadan Ensemble, Dominic Montague and Katie Richardson respond to the lockdown crisis.

It’s a glorious get-together of a show, as warming as the whiskey handed out to the audience – but you’ll have to pour your own.</p> <h2>Le Patin Libre</h2> <p>Think dance on ice and you’d imagine sequins and staggering TV celebrities, but the Canadian troupe, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaKYSUrHSfs\">Le Patin Libre</a>, has taken the art form into a new dimension.

The 70-minute double bill runs at the Orange Tree until 26 June but will be livestreamed on 3 and 4 June. Read the full review. Paradise Lost (Lies Unopened Beside Me) Did Milton’s biblical epic escape your lockdown reading list of classics? Fear not: Ben Duke returns with his celebrated one-man version, created with his Lost Dog company and presented by the Place. Duke performs live on 5 June and it’s available again on 6 June. Duke’s show is for the ages – funny, profound, inspiring and soaked with as much a sense of loss as creation, a reminder that Milton was in mourning for his wife when he wrote the poem. Shakespeare’s Globe If you can’t get into the Wooden O for its new summer season then fear not: most of the shows are being streamed. There’s a revival of the carnivalesque 2019 Midsummer Night’s Dream, director Ola Ince’s eagerly awaited Romeo and Juliet, and Twelfth Night with artistic director Michelle Terry as Viola. The Globe Player also has heaps of past productions to rent, including an international selection from the 2012 Globe to Globe festival such as a Lithuanian Hamlet, a Japanese Coriolanus and an Armenian King John. There is also the candlelit Sam Wanamaker Playhouse’s opening production, The Duchess of Malfi, starring Gemma Arterton. Fleabag You’ve watched both TV series. You’ve read the scripts. Maybe you’ve even seen the stage show more than once. But you’ll probably still be streaming Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s performance of her wildly successful monologue, recorded at Wyndham’s theatre in London, where it sold out in the summer of 2019. Fleabag is available to stream from Amazon Prime, as part of a partnership with the National Theatre that includes three other NT Live favourites: Hamlet with Benedict Cumberbatch; Frankenstein with Cumberbatch and Jonny Lee Miller and Ian McKellen’s 80th-birthday solo show. All available from 11 June. Drowntown Rhiannon Faith’s dance-theatre productions have tackled tough subjects in bold and surprising ways: her fringe show Scary Shit wormed its way into the brain with its mix of troubling and comforting images. Faith’s new piece is built around autobiographical testimonies of isolation and research into the challenges faced by coastal towns with underfunded services, presenting “a society at tipping point”. Performed by a cast of six including the phenomenal Shelley Eva Haden. Available from 1-30 June. Dep Previously seen at Edinburgh fringe’s Zoo Southside in 2018, this award-winning physical theatre show about death and rebirth is choreographed by Dam Van Huynh and takes its name from the Vietnamese word for beautiful. When the Guardian asked its multinational cast to describe the work in just one word they answered “resilience”, “human”, “introspective” and “alive”. One added that it’s “an eyeful” – after all, it’s performed fully naked. Available until 3June as part of the Arts Institute Plymouth’s Making It season. Footprints festival Jermyn Street theatre is streaming its reopening festival, crammed with more than 40 shows, including monologues, two-handers, cabaret and poetry. Highlights include Ade Morris’s drama about aviator Amy Johnson, Lone Flyer, which received rave reviews at the Watermill, and a revival of Mr and Mrs Nobody, Keith Waterhouse’s spin on George and Weedon Grossmith’s diary of finicky clerk Mr Pooter. The season opens with Biyi Bandele’s award-winner Two Horsemen. Festival runs until 1 August. Read the review of Two Horsemen.

With other pieces by Alice Nutter, Maxine Peake, Leanna Benjamin and Kamal Kaan, and staged by a top-notch set of directors, it’s a birthday party that’s not to be missed. Until 5 June. Touchy Originally designed as a gig-theatre stage show before the pandemic, this project from 20 Stories High was commissioned by the Wellcome Collection to explore the importance of touch for young people. The theme took on new resonance in our world of social distancing and the show has spawned five homemade short films instead, created by emerging Liverpool artists. The films are released weekly, with the complete series available on 10 June. Royal Ballet The Royal Opera House has worked wonders during the pandemic to open up new, live performances and past productions for an audience at home. Its current offerings include an evening of George Balanchine and Jerome Robbins (available from 11 June-11 July) and its grand reopening show, 21st-Century Choreographers, which features Christopher Wheeldon’s sumptuous Within the Golden Hour, a new duet by American star choreographer Kyle Abraham and two shows, The Statement and Solo Echo, by the Canadian dance-theatre sensation Crystal Pite. 21st-Century Choreographers is available until 27 June. Read the full review. Ad Libido Around a third of young and middle-aged women suffer from a form of sexual dysfunction. Not everyone feels able to talk about it but Fran Bushe put her experiences centre-stage with Ad Libido, a solo comedy theatre show about the problems she had with desire, orgasm and pain during sex. Bush has since written a short Channel 4 comedy and a novel, My Broken Vagina, and is taking the show back to Soho theatre in late summer. But you can also stream it until 19 June via Oxford’s Old Fire Station. Touching the Void Bristol Old Vic brings back its nail-biting 2018 hit show based on Joe Simpson’s 1988 mountaineering memoir, adapted by David Greig, directed by Tom Morris and featuring an awe-inspiring set design by Ti Green.

After a two-week run on stage at London’s Turbine theatre, the festival goes online, 31 May-4 July. Lit Sophie Ellerby’s slow-burning drama about looking for love and the fear of being left behind is set over the summer holidays bridging Years 9 and 10 in a Nottingham secondary school. Full of insights about teenagers’ initiations to adulthood, it was a revelation at Aldeburgh’s HighTide festival in 2019. Now filmed, it is available on demand from 1-29 June as part of Nottingham Playhouse’s Spring Loaded season, which includes Still Life: Untold Stories from Nottingham Now, a collection of short films featuring a new vignette by Alan Bennett; the dystopian audio drama Oh for F*ck’s Sake (I’m in Love With You) by Samson Hawkins; and First Touch, Nathaniel Price’s play about football’s child sex abuse scandal. Sound Stage What do you miss about theatre? If it’s not only the plays but also the preshow buzz, interval chatter with friends and postshow discussions then you’re not alone. Sound Stage is a new digital initiative from Pitlochry Festival theatre and the Royal Lyceum in collaboration with Naked Productions. It aims to recreate elements of the social experience of theatregoing, complete with a virtual bar where visitors can mingle. The opening season of audio plays brings together eight fantastic writers: Mark Ravenhill, Timberlake Wertenbaker, Roy Williams, John Byrne, Jaimini Jethwa, Lynda Radley, Gary McNair and Frances Poet. Home: Part One In January, the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes published its long-awaited report on the “appalling” abuse at mother and baby institutions run by both the state and the Catholic church in Ireland. This devastating series of dramatised readings, directed by Graham McLaren and Neil Murray, gives voice to those experiences, with testimonies – and extracts from the report – read on stage by actors and some of the survivors themselves. Available until 17 July. Read more. BBC Lights Up The BBC’s virtual theatre festival offers 18 newly recorded productions for TV, radio and online.

The pieces are written by Peake, Ella Hickson, Kit de Waal and Jeanette Winterson. There are also two new monologues: standup Kiri Pritchard-McLean’s Putting a Face On is about gaslighting and stars Susan Wokoma, while Regina Taylor’s Aisha (the black album) traces the history of black women’s political power and is performed by Jade Anouka. Musicals: The Greatest Show With dozens of stars and thousands of spotlights, Sheridan Smith hosts a celebration of musical theatre at the London Palladium. Smith performs Don’t Rain on My Parade from Funny Girl, the queens of West End smash-hit Six perform in the balcony and there are songs from Dear Evan Hansen, Everybody’s Talking About Jamie, Dreamgirls and more, plus Nicole Scherzinger (in rather fabulous earrings) beams in from LA with a brilliant rendition of Never Enough from The Greatest Showman. Available all year on BBC iPlayer. The Macbeths Director Dominic Hill and writer Frances Poet slashed down Shakespeare’s tragedy to create a gripping two-hander thriller staged at the Citizens theatre in Glasgow in 2017. Now it’s a 60-minute film that unfolds in and around the murderous couple’s bed. Charlene Boyd and Keith Fleming reprise their roles. From 3 June. Barnes’ People He is best known for The Ruling Class but many of Peter Barnes’s plays are overdue a revival; so here’s an attractive proposition from Original Theatre Company and Perfectly Normal Productions. It’s a set of four monologues Barnes wrote for Radio 3 in the 80s and includes True Born Englishman, about a Buckingham Palace footman, which was never aired by the BBC and now gets its world premiere. Filmed on stage at the Theatre Royal Windsor, the monologues are performed by Jon Culshaw, Matthew Kelly, Jemma Redgrave and Adrian Scarborough. Streaming until 31 July. Read the full review.

A co-production with Theatre Uncut, directed by Emma Callander, Parry’s play was originally scheduled as part of the Sherman’s autumn season last year and was shortlisted for the inaugural Theatre Uncut political playwriting award. Available until 12 June. Read the full review. Really Want to Hurt Me Written and directed by Ben SantaMaria for his company Flaming Theatre, this monologue charts how pop music and theatre keep a young gay teenager afloat as he experiences bullying and isolation in 80s Devon. It’s performed by Ryan Price at Theatre503 in London in 2018, filmed by My Reel Productions, before the show went on an acclaimed UK tour. Northern Ballet Yorkshire’s high-flying ballet company presents a pay-what-you-can digital season including short new premieres and the full version of Cathy Marston’s acclaimed regal spectacular Victoria. Choreographer Kenneth Tindall and film-maker Dan Lowenstein collaborate on Northern Lights, which brings dancers to the streets of Leeds, and Tindall’s Have Your Cake takes inspiration from the nation baking banana bread in lockdown. Ballet Black’s Mthuthuzeli November presents What Used To, No Longer Is, choreographed and created entirely remotely. National Theatre at Home After the success of its weekly Thursday night streams during lockdown, the NT launched a catalogue of past hits online. You can either become a subscriber, or pay per play.

New plays are added to the collection each month. Uncle Vanya Ian Rickson’s indelible production of Chekhov’s masterpiece, in a new version by Conor McPherson, was a West End sensation at the start of 2020. After it closed early due to the pandemic, Rickson and producer Sonia Friedman reunited most of the cast for this innovative filmed version. Each performance rings true – from Toby Jones in the title role to Aimee Lou Wood’s Sonya, Richard Armitage’s Astrov and the always excellent Rosalind Eleazar as Yelena. And Bruno Poet’s lighting and Rae Smith’s set design combine to spellbinding effect. On BBC iPlayer. Earwig With the stage out of bounds, theatre-makers are devising ever more creative sonic experiments to be enjoyed at home. Directed by Finn den Hertog and composed and sound-designed by Danny Krass, Earwig is billed as a series of “audio drama podcasts” from the Tron in Glasgow.

Typical In 2019, Richard Blackwood gave a compelling performance at the Edinburgh fringe and Soho theatre in a monologue retelling the story of British-Nigerian Christopher Alder, the decorated paratrooper from Hull who died while handcuffed on the floor of a Humberside police station in 1998. Now, the acclaimed play by Ryan Calais Cameron has been turned into a film directed by Anastasia Osei-Kuffour. It explores, says the playwright, “the negotiations that black people need to make in order to do things that seem simple to others”. Read the five-star review. The Inquest Fancy solving a crime from your sofa? This piece of puzzle theatre invites audiences to crack clues with strangers – or you can arrange a private show to team up with your pals. Viewers turned jurors are presented with a tangled web of evidence from a cold case and assisted through their deliberations by the performers Joe Ball (as a coroner) and Tom Black (as a police archivist). It’s the second creation from Jury Games whose debut, Jury Duty, is still available online. Read the full review. Myths and Adventures from Ancient Greece If home-schooling feels like opening a Pandora’s box, well, here’s a fun way to help your kids engage with the Greek myths on the curriculum. Hannah Khalil has created new versions of the tales of Pandora, Persephone, King Midas and Theseus and the Minotaur. They’re intended for those aged three to eight but will appeal to older viewers, too. Available on YouTube from Waterman’s Arts Centre, they are staged by the director Ian Nicholson and designer Sam Wilde, who brightened up lockdown with their delightful puppet versions of the picture books I Want My Hat Back and Shh! We Have a Plan. Shipwreck First staged at the Almeida in 2019, Shipwreck by Anne “Mr Burns” Washburn gave a sprawling account of modern-day American politics and the rise and potential fall of Trump. It was due to be staged at the Public theatre in New York in 2020 but was instead adapted by Saheem Ali as a three-part audio play in a co-production with Woolly Mammoth theatre company. Set during a getaway for a bunch of friends in upstate New York in 2017, it’s a knotty appraisal of an American moment that, strikingly, already feels like a vanishing era. What the Constitution Means to Me Heidi Schreck’s phenomenal Broadway show has received five-star reviews from Guardian critics on both sides of the Atlantic. Now available to stream from Amazon, it charts what the supreme law of the US has meant to generations of women, as Schreck recreates the debating competitions she took part in as a teenager. Directed by Marielle Heller, it’s shatteringly funny, deeply disturbing yet imbued with optimism. The Cost of Living As a tribute to the acclaimed disabled dancer David Toole, who died in October, the physical theatre company DV8 have shared their multi-award-winning 2004 film The Cost of Living online. Shot on location at a faded seaside resort in Norfolk, it follows two street performers (Toole and Eddie Kay) in a portrait of friendship and prejudice, brimming with spellbinding images. Available on DV8’s Media Portal for a small membership fee. Unmissable. Pippin They’ve got magic to do, just for you: the original 1980 Broadway production of the Tony award-winning musical, with catchy songs by Stephen Schwartz and some glorious moves by Bob Fosse, is available to stream on Amazon. Ben Vereen is the beguiling leading player of a troupe who may or may not lead the eponymous prince to self-immolation. It’s bizarre and frequently frustrating, but a fascinating chapter of Broadway history. Get the backstage view in the series Fosse/Verdon on BBC iPlayer. The York Mystery Plays This pandemic year has seen a boom in sales for classic fiction as we finally get round to reading famous “bucket list” novels. Why not do the same for theatre – and why not start with some of the York Mystery Plays, which date back to the 1300s? Four of the biblical dramas, including the story of Adam and Eve, have been adapted for BBC radio, with a cast of community and professional actors for York Theatre Royal’s Collective Acts project. An American in Paris Feted at the Châtelet in Paris in 2014, Christopher Wheeldon’s resplendent staging of the Gershwins’ classic went on to conquer Broadway and the West End. It’s available on a new streaming platform, Stage2View.com, which also offers the musicals Kinky Boots and 42nd Street, as well as Michael Grandage’s Mark Rothko drama Red, starring Alfred Molina as the artist. User Not Found When we die, what becomes of our digital identity? Do all those tweets and posts endure for eternity – and who decides? The site-specific theatre company Dante or Die asked such questions, and many more, in a thoughtful and funny 2018 show by Chris Goode that was staged in cafes. It has now been reimagined as a 50-minute video podcast, available from the Guardian until 31 March 2022. Flight Paths This production by the theatre company Extant celebrates the rich history of Goze, itinerant blind performers who traditionally travelled around Japan to bring audiences a vast selection of stories – accompanied by music played on their shamisen stringed instruments. Flight Paths fuses old and new, bringing together archive material about the Goze, animation and filmed modern performance, in an accessible hour-long digital experience. good dog Arinzé Kene’s poetic 2017 play good dog posed unanswered questions about the UK’s summer riots of 2011. Revived for a tour last year, it has now been adapted as a superb 20-minute film, directed by Andrew Gillman and Natalie Ibu for Tiata Fahodzi. Anton Cross stars as a man looking back on his youth, his neighbours and his community. The film was commissioned by The Space and supported by the BBC and Arts Council England. Charlotte Holmes: Adventure Box Lockdown restrictions and cancelled travel plans have narrowed horizons for little adventurers. So this “seven-day theatrical experience” for families is both a delight and a relief. Created by Huddersfield’s Lawrence Batley theatre, the Dukes in Lancaster and theatre producers the Big Tiny, it’s a series of mysteries encountered by Charlotte, a young girl evacuated to Yorkshire during the second world war. You solve the puzzles by watching jaunty online videos and opening up the envelopes and parcels inside an adventure box sent to you in the post when you book. The Big Tiny’s follow-up, Balthazar Snapdragon, is just as fun. Read the full review. Hamilton Lin-Manuel Miranda’s phenomenal, Pulitzer prize-winning musical about the “10-dollar founding father without a father” was filmed over three nights in New York in 2016 with the original Broadway cast. Slated for a 2021 cinema release, it was instead fast-tracked on to the Disney+ streaming service. It’s directed by Thomas Kail, who staged the musical, and according to Miranda gives “everyone the best seat in the house”. Watch it once and, to quote Jonathan Groff’s frothing King George III, You’ll Be Back. Read the full, five-star review. As Waters Rise Ben Weatherill’s play is set in the year 2025 when a flood has left Britain in a state of emergency. Originally planned for a stage production, it is now a three-part audio drama directed by Alex Brown and featuring teenage actors from the Almeida Young Company, who recorded their parts in isolation during lockdown. Released as part of Shifting Tides, the Almeida’s digital festival about the climate emergency, aimed at and created with 14- to 25-year-olds. Read the full review. Culture in Quarantine The BBC’s Culture in Quarantine programme on iPlayer includes Jade Anouka and Grace Savage’s Her &amp; Her; Crystal Pite and Jonathon Young’s five-star show Revisor; Where I Go (When I Can’t Be Where I Am), about living with chronic pain, conceived and directed by Rachel Bagshaw and written by Chris Thorpe; Corey Baker’s marvellous mini Swan Lake, performed in dancers’ baths; and Open Clasp theatre company’s Sugar, devised with women who are homeless, on probation or in prison. First, Do No Harm Sharon D Clarke has portrayed a long line of memorable characters but this is something else. In a new short play by Bernardine Evaristo, directed by Adrian Lester, Clarke speaks for the National Health Service and those who work for it, reflecting on the NHS’s past and future. As she proudly says: “I am one of the best things that has ever happened.” First, Do No Harm is part of a series celebrating the NHS entitled The Greatest Wealth, curated for the Old Vic by Lolita Chakrabarti. The Old Vic is also pioneering socially distanced live performances and rehearsed readings as well as archive recordings of past productions. Nine Lives Slam poet and playwright Zodwa Nyoni was born in Zimbabwe and grew up in Yorkshire. The locations are combined in her vivid 2016 monologue, in which Lladel Bryant plays Ishmael, a young gay Zimbabwean who flees homophobic violence in his home country and seeks asylum in the UK where he is dispersed to Leeds. Alex Chisholm’s hour-long production, available on YouTube, was recorded at the Arcola theatre in London. The Lord Chamberlain’s Men The all-male theatre company, known for touring open-air Shakespeare productions around the UK, has postponed its Macbeth until next year but shared two past productions on YouTube and on their website: The Tempest, staged in 2018, and A Midsummer Night’s Dream, presented last year to mark the company’s 15th birthday. They encourage you to recreate the spirit of their productions at home – “whether it is on a picnic blanket in your living room or under the stars wrapped up warm” – and share the results on social media. Richard II Quite simply one of 2019’s most celebrated and momentous stagings of Shakespeare. Adjoa Andoh stars as Richard and co-directs, with Lynette Linton, a superb cast entirely comprising women of colour including Shobna Gulati and Ayesha Dharker.

Scenes for Survival The National Theatre of Scotland was among the first theatres to announce a lockdown programme of work responding to the pandemic. Its growing collection of short films is designed to offer audiences “hope and joy”. There’s Brian Cox as Ian Rankin’s Edinburgh detective John Rebus, Two Doors Down’s Jonathan Watson as a shipyard electrician suffering from exposure to asbestos, and Kate Dickie as brilliant as ever in a monologue by Jenni Fagan.

Read the full review. Matthew Bourne’s The Red Shoes One of the major dance productions cut short by the coronavirus crisis was Matthew Bourne’s tour of The Red Shoes, his rapturously received version of the Powell and Pressburger film. But a recording of the sumptuous stage performance made at Sadler’s Wells, starring Ashley Shaw in the role made famous by Moira Shearer, is available on BBC iPlayer. Bourne’s company New Adventures has also unveiled a charming 12-minute film version, performed by the cast from home – among children’s toys in their living rooms, on tables, in gardens and backyards, and in the kitchen. The costumes include football kits and, in one case, a couple of towels. Pass Over Antoinette Nwandu’s blistering, Beckettian play about police brutality was filmed at Chicago’s Steppenwolf theatre by Spike Lee for this 75-minute version, which crackles with humour, tension and tragedy. Lee skilfully weaves the audience, and the world outside the theatre, into a work that our critic Arifa Akbar gives five stars. Available on Amazon Prime. Read the full review. Unprecedented How’s this for a lineup? The cast includes Katherine Parkinson, Paterson Joseph and Denise Gough. The writers include James Graham, Jasmine Lee-Jones, Prasanna Puwanarajah and April De Angelis. And Ned Bennett, Blanche McIntyre, Ola Ince and Tinuke Craig are among the directors.

Sea Wall “She had us, both of us, absolutely round her finger …” From that first line, Andrew Scott will have you hooked in this half-hour monologue by Simon Stephens that captures truths about family life, art, nature and much else besides. Scott performed the play at the Bush in 2008 and it was a hot ticket when he reprised it at the Old Vic 10 years later. This version was shot in a single take in 2011. Directed by Stephens and Andrew Porter, it is available online to buy. Brace yourself. I Wish I Was a Mountain With wonder, wit and sophisticated storytelling, performance poet Toby Thompson creates a beautiful show for over-sevens. Thompson steps in and out of his version of Hermann Hesse’s fairytale Faldum, riffing with the young audience and spinning a handful of jazz LPs. I Wish I Was a Mountain embraces big questions about time and contentment. This is a short but profound show, directed by Lee Lyford, hatched by the Egg theatre’s Incubator development programme and cleverly designed by Anisha Fields. Read the full review.

Fragments (Beckett by Brook) Is there a more fitting playwright for our current moment of isolation, uncertainty and endurance than Beckett?

And so begins an epic patchwork of masochistic rituals, nightmares and games, blending the quotidian with the phenomenal, all inspired by the choreographer’s trip to Sicily.

Alternately rousing and yearning, this is a gorgeous hymn to barflies, precious memories and the joys of being a ghost, told with a dash of Edgar Allan Poe and Thelonious Monk. It’s a glorious get-together of a show, as warming as the whiskey handed out to the audience – but you’ll have to pour your own. Le Patin Libre Think dance on ice and you’d imagine sequins and staggering TV celebrities, but the Canadian troupe, Le Patin Libre, has taken the art form into a new dimension. In their double bill, Vertical Influences, the skaters turned the rink into a mesmerising stage slowly decorated by the patterns cut by their blades.

AltEn advertised itself as a “green recycling” location where agricultural companies could dispose of unwanted supplies of these pesticide-treated seeds. Bayer AG, which owns Monsanto, along with Syngenta, Corteva, and other large companies, were among those dumping seeds coated with an array of insecticides and fungicides at AltEn, according to AltEn marketing materials.

Wet distillers’ grains made as a byproduct could be fed back to the cattle, a common industry practice. But after just a few months, the plant closed and E3 filed for bankruptcy in late 2007. AltEn later restarted the plant, telling regulators in 2013 the plant would be using grain, “mainly corn”, as its primary raw material. Nebraska regulators discovered in 2015, however, that AltEn was using pesticide-coated seeds, one of only two ethanol plants in the United States known to do so. Records show by 2018 the regulators knew the byproducts contained “measurable” pesticide residues and by 2019 they knew the pesticides were present in “elevated concentrations”. According to correspondence between the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the NDEE, tests run on AltEn’s wet cake and wastewater showed “very high levels of pesticide residues”, including neonicotinoids, which are known neurotoxins. The fact that the material had been applied to area fields meant the pesticides could leach into groundwater and be taken up into plant tissues, contaminating nectar and pollen and threatening wildlife, the EPA warned. The NDEE ordered AltEn to stop distributing the waste for land application in 2019 because of the pesticide levels. But the agency did not stop the company from taking in more pesticide-coated seed. Over the years, AltEn racked up multiple violations of environmental regulations, NDEE records show. But it was not until February of this year that NDEE ordered the plant to close until the contamination was cleaned up. Only days after the shutdown, a pipe attached to a 4m-gallon digester tank broke, washing toxins into waterways and spreading them at least 4.5 miles away, according to regulators. In May, another leak was discovered in a pipe adjacent to a wastewater lagoon. Monitoring health While regulators sample water and soil, many area residents worry that the beef cattle operation adjacent to the AltEn plant has also been contaminated. They wonder how much the animals there may have been exposed to pesticide concentrates through their feed and water, and if people who consumed meat from those animals may have long-term health consequences. “People want answers and action,” said Jane Kleeb, who chairs the Nebraska Democratic party and is pushing for resources, such as medical testing and water filtration, for the people in and around Mead. Researchers from the University of Nebraska and Creighton University are now launching a 10-year study of the impacts on human and environmental health. The situation is but the latest example of how industrial agricultural practices can create hazards dangerous to human and environmental health, according to Blood, who grew up on a farm in Hastings, Nebraska, and suspects cancers developed by many Hastings residents were linked to chemicals in the soil and water. The area was designated a federal superfund site because of the contamination. “There is a lot of stuff like this that goes on in a lot of these small towns,” she said. “There are more Meads out there.”","charCount":"9225","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/carey-gillam\">Carey Gillam</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2021/may/29/non-fungible-tokens-digital-fad-planet-nfts-artists-fossil-fuels","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-29T10:00:22Z","webTitle":"Non-fungible tokens aren’t a harmless digital fad – they’re a disaster for our planet | Adam Greenfield","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/may/29/non-fungible-tokens-digital-fad-planet-nfts-artists-fossil-fuels","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2021/may/29/non-fungible-tokens-digital-fad-planet-nfts-artists-fossil-fuels","fields":{"headline":"Non-fungible tokens aren’t a harmless digital fad – they’re a disaster for our planet","standfirst":"<p>Artists are harnessing NFTs to sell their work but ignoring the vast amount of fossil fuels needed to power them <br></p>","trailText":"Artists are harnessing NFTs to sell their work but ignoring the vast amount of fossil fuels needed to power them , says technology writer Adam Greenfield <br>","byline":"Adam Greenfield","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b5f31793ee5fab0b3f7967e339d8c733ac914c58\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b5f31793ee5fab0b3f7967e339d8c733ac914c58/119_143_2862_1717/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Superchief Gallery NFT, New York, a physical gallery dedicated exclusively to NFT artwork.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘The NFT frenzy marks the convergence of the art world and the Ponzi-like dynamics of cryptocurrency trading.’ Superchief Gallery NFT, New York, a physical gallery dedicated exclusively to NFT artwork.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Szenes/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>If you happen to count yourself among those appalled by the seemingly unstoppable rise of NFTs, or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/mar/13/how-non-fungible-tokens-became-the-latest-tech-speculation-bubble\">non-fungible tokens</a>, over the past few months, you might be forgiven a little schadenfreude at the recent news that a <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/2021/03/26/mars-house-fraud-3d-visualiser-nft/\">dispute has broken out</a> over the ownership of Mars House, a digital file that sold in March for $512,000 (£360,000).</p> <p>Let’s be clear what’s been purchased here.

Bad Boy Chiller Crew The Bradford bassline warriors, AKA MCs Kane, Clive, and GK, recently grazed the UK Top 40 with the WKD Blue-infused Don’t You Worry About Me, a paean to carefree summer fun. “Boys go loco, boys go savage,” spits Kane in the video before swapping quad-biking around a field for this summer’s must-have video prop: a Jacuzzi. Claud California-based Claud Mintz’s debut Super Monster is the perfect soundtrack to a hastily organised, park-based, 6pm catch-up that involves BOGOF cans of G&amp;T and big bags of posh crisps. Its gorgeously meandering, sun-dappled lo-fi indie pop was made for a slow summer sunset. Worth braving the hay fever for. Priya Ragu Tamil-Swiss artist Ragu calls her box-fresh blend of R&amp;B, hip-hop and south Indian music “Raguwavy”. The intoxicating influences are matched by an aesthetic that’s essentially summer as a moodboard: all burnt oranges and daffodil yellows, even on the blown-out ballad Forgot About, when the revelry is replaced by wistful reminiscence. LSDXOXO The title of NYC-bred, Berlin-based DJ, producer and performer LSDXOXO’s EP, Dedicated 2 Disrespect, will likely be some people’s summer 2021 slogan. Over four deliciously messy “ghetto house” tracks, LSDXOXO creates a queer party that demands to be played very loudly in a dark room with very sweaty walls.","charCount":"2709","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"true","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/michaelcragg\">Michael Cragg</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2021/may/29/los-angeles-mayor-eric-garcetti-india-ambassador","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-29T10:00:22Z","webTitle":"The LA mayor’s ‘jinx:’ Garcetti could leave for India as city faces host of challenges","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/29/los-angeles-mayor-eric-garcetti-india-ambassador","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2021/may/29/los-angeles-mayor-eric-garcetti-india-ambassador","fields":{"headline":"The LA mayor’s ‘jinx:’ Garcetti could leave for India as city faces host of challenges","standfirst":"<p>Eric Garcetti, who may join the Biden administration, would leave behind a thorny legacy in the megacity</p>","trailText":"Eric Garcetti, who may join the Biden administration, would leave behind a thorny legacy in the megacity","byline":"Sam Levin in Los Angeles","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a395ff5f652fbbbf68ba050a22dad72bc14a1ad3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a395ff5f652fbbbf68ba050a22dad72bc14a1ad3/0_176_5344_3207/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eric Garcetti speaks during a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eric Garcetti speaks during a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jacquelyn Martin/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>The question has loomed over Los Angeles politics for years: when will the mayor resign?</p> <p>Pundits have long predicted that Eric Garcetti, the mayor with clear ambitions for higher office, would not finish out his second term.

Now, it seems likely that the Democrat running the second largest city in the US will be stepping down more than a year early – with widespread reports that Joe Biden has selected him as his ambassador to India. If confirmed, Garcetti, 50, will be leaving behind a thorny legacy in a megacity facing a confluence of challenges: a warming climate, congestion and air pollution, a housing crisis, gentrification battles and some of the worst economic inequality in America. While he has enacted major policies on climate and transit, he could be departing amid a sexual harassment case in his office and at a time when his popularity in the heavily Democratic city has slipped. Garcetti has increasingly become a target of progressive groups over his policies on policing, homelessness, and other racial justice issues. “LA is facing some serious problems, and I think he understands that this isn’t a record that he is going to want for the rest of his career,” said Jessica Levinson, a Loyola law professor. “It is hard to run for higher office when your most recent resume line is mayor of LA.

When it was rumored last year that he was under consideration for a cabinet position (possibly transportation or housing secretary), Black Lives Matter LA and other activist groups began holding loud, daily protests outside Getty House, the mayor’s residence, urging Biden not to pick a “self-seeking mayor for a cabinet position in which he is completely unqualified”. The mayor announced he would not be taking a secretary job in December, citing the city’s rapidly worsening Covid catastrophe. Garcetti, the youngest mayor in LA in more than a century, would likely defend his record by pointing to his leadership during Covid, his efforts to stabilize the economy, his bid to bring the Olympics to LA in 2028, and his green jobs plan, said Levinson. It remains to be seen how the Olympics will impact the city, with opponents arguing that the games would accelerate displacement, gentrification and inequality. The LA Times editorial board recently urged Garcetti to stay, praising his “vision for a more livable, transit-oriented, environmentally and technologically friendly city” and his success at passing a new earthquake safety law. Carlo De La Cruz, California deputy for the Sierra Club’s My Generation Campaign, praised the mayor’s goals of 100% clean energy by 2045 and committing to an entirely electric fleet for garbage trucks: “It’s an achievement that I think people will remember as a critical shift … that will create ripple effects for the west coast and hopefully the nation.” The mayor succeeded in pushing a key transportation funding measure in 2016 and set commendable goals for improved mobility and safer streets, said Juan Matute, the deputy director of the UCLA Institute of Transportation Studies.

He pointed to the 2015 LAPD fatal shooting of an unhoused Skid Row resident, Charly Africa Keunang, amid a Safer Cities initiative, which funded officer patrols in the neighborhood. Most recently, city leaders faced intense scrutiny for the eviction of a homeless community from a popular park, aided by police. Garcetti has recently touted his proposed $1bn budget for homelessness, which would go to new housing projects, homelessness prevention and eviction defense programs and the expansion of services and cleanup teams. He also made national headlines with his announcement of a basic income program that could be the largest in the nation. But racial justice groups have been pressing the mayor to redirect funds away from LAPD and into services and programs, and while there has been some reallocation, Garcetti, in what could be his final days, has pushed a police budget increase. Garcetti was co-opting BLM’s words by calling his proposal a “justice budget” and claiming to “reimagine” public safety while expanding police funds, said Dr Melina Abdullah, the BLMLA co-founder: “He appropriates our language and then does the exact opposite … This is really a rightwing strategy.

But for one reason and another, it’s never quite happened. Three second places in the majors, three thirds, 16 top-ten finishes. It’s about that time, and yesterday’s flawless 66 was carpe-diem stuff. This is the first time she’s led the US Open after any round, a stat that might not say much about most 26-year-olds, but Thompson first played in this tournament in 2007 at the precocious age of 12. This is her 15th consecutive appearance. Is she finally going to land major number two?</p> <p><strong>Yuka Saso is best placed to stop her. </strong>The powerful Filipino spent most of yesterday’s round driving like Seve, but no matter, thanks to her ability to gouge back into position, as though the penal Olympic Club rough wasn’t there, and her scrambling skills around the greens; she chips a bit like Seve, too. If she wins today, she’ll join Inbee Park as the only teenage winner of the US Open. Park won in 2008 at 19 years, 11 months and 17 days; that’s Saso’s <em>exact age </em>today. Some things seem written.</p> <p><strong>Or could Megha Ganne become only the second amateur to win the US Open, matching the feat of Catherine Lacoste in 1967?</strong> The 17-year-old from New Jersey received vociferous support from the gallery yesterday, at one point getting to within a shot of the lead. When asked for her secret, she smiled: “I figure why not make it fun?” She’s the real deal.</p> <p><strong>Some big names are lurking, including 2019 champion Jeongeun Lee6, 2012 PGA winner Shanshan Feng, major champs in waiting Nasa Hataoka and Megan Khang, and seven-time major winner Inbee Park. </strong>Should Thompson and Saso hit their stride, it will be a two-woman race, but anything can happen at Olympic Club, and it can happen to the best of them: just ask Arnold Palmer, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/feb/25/joy-of-six-sporting-chokes\">lost a seven-stroke lead on the back nine to Billy Casper in the 1966 men’s version</a>.

Not sure this over-thinking is doing her any good. Her ball comes out hot and rolls down the hill at the back of the green. That’s where Feng found herself, ending up with bogey. Speaking of Shanshan, she’s just found the heart of the par-three 13th. Nowhere near the flag, but look what happened to Angel Yin when she failed to find the green. The tension has been cranked up all across the Lake Course. Thompson sends a slice into the thick stuff down the right of 12. This is no time for her driver to start malfunctioning, not on a course as penal as this. Thompson may have stumbled, but those around her are making mistakes too. Feng can’t make her par saver on 12. Yin meanwhile takes three putts on her way to a double at the 144-yard par-three 12th. And while Lexi was making a mess of 11, Saso was bogeying it too, punishment for overhitting a chip from the back of the green and sending her ball toppling down a ridge. The back nine on Sunday at a major championship, ladies and gentlemen! -6: Thompson (11) -3: Feng (12) -2: Khang (13), Saso (11) -1: Yin (13), Hataoka (12) Lee6 (12) Thompson’s lead is suddenly only two. Her monster par putt breaks six feet to the right, then for the first time she prods with great uncertainty at a putt, sending it bobbling to the right of the cup. Her first double of the week, and suddenly this tournament takes on a different complexion. -6: Thompson (11) -4: Feng (11) -3: Yin (12) -2: Khang (13), Saso (11) Feng’s second into 12 bounds over the back. She gives the subsequent chip too much. “Sit! Sit!” The ball does not sit. She’ll have a 12-footer coming back for par. Meanawhile on the par-three 13th, trouble for Yin, whose tee shot tipples down the swale to the left of the green. Shortsided, she tries to stun her chip into the bank, hoping it’ll take all the pace out of it ... but her aim is poor and the ball flies through the green. A long par putt remains. Thompson takes a long time over her chip. She steps away from it a couple of times, clearly in two minds. Unsettled, it’s no huge surprise when she chunks it. Time to regroup, because things can unravel quickly around the Olympic Club. Big putt from the fringe, in more ways than one, coming up. Meanwhile the first-round leader Mel Reid is in with her second 78 of the weekend, and finishes the week at +12. It’s not the greatest of lies. Thompson hacks out hard, but she can’t get the ball to the green. She’s a good 30 yards short. A big up-and-down attempt coming up. Feng launches a 5-iron straight at the flag on 11. That’s a fine shot, and she’ll get a look at birdie from ten feet. She doesn’t make the putt, though, the ball breaking off to the left on its last turn, and the chance to reduce the lead to three is gone. Back on the tee, Thompson pulls her drive into the thick stuff down the left. A slight look of concern washes across her face as she imagines the lie. Thompson misreads the line, the ball breaking well left, but pace is her friend. Perfectly judged, and she’s left with a two-footer to tidy up. Which she does, without fear or fuss. For a player who has often succumbed to nerves from short distances, she’s holding herself together wonderfully. There doesn’t seem a chink in her armour this week, though the back nine at a major is different terrain. A three-putt bogey for Khang on 11. Her putter’s let her down again, for the second time in three holes. She’s -2. Meanwhile a minor mistake by the leader on 10, as Thompson leaves a wedge short of the green from 70 yards. She’s left with a 30-foot putt across a ridge. A long birdie putt for Feng on 10 comes up short. Par. She’s -4. Up on 11, Yin sends an arrow straight at the flag and leaves herself a six-foot look for birdie. But she sends a fidgety effort to the right, and that’s a huge chance to grab a share of second spurned. Thompson sends her second at 9 to ten feet, then looks to have made the birdie putt. The ball inexplicably stays up, teetering on the right-hand edge of the cup. You’d expect it to topple, but it’s not cooperating, and she’s forced to tap in for par. Still, she’s out in 34, which compares favourably to her partners Saso (38) and Ganne (41). Thompson remains four in front at -8. Nasa Hataoka rattles in a right-to-left 20-footer on 9, and that’s her second birdie in three holes. She’s back to -2. She’s going round with Shanshan Feng, who has now grabbed second spot all for herself after sending her approach to four feet and tidying up for birdie. Back down the hole, Thompson splits the fairway with a booming 3-wood. And up on 10, Khang sends her second pin high to eight feet, and knocks in the birdie putt. It only just drops, mind. That needed every single joule of energy. She smiles at her caddy and mimes a heart flutter. Khang is great value. -8: Thompson (8) -4: Feng (9) -3: Yin (10), Khang (10), Saso (8) -2: Hataoka (9) -1: Lee6 (9) Saso chips delicately to a couple of feet. What an up and down! The 19-year-old Filipino has responded excellently to those back-to-back doubles early in her round. For a while it looked as though her head was spinning, but she’s showing real moxie here. Thompson meanwhile leaves her long birdie putt four feet short, and here comes the first test for a player whose flat stick has misbehaved in the past. No problem! In it goes. The gap’s still five. With shots in hand, Lexi can afford to play smart. Saso has to go for the pin at the par-three 8th. It’s tucked away front left, and though she sends it close, her ball bounds into the rough. Shortsided and in the thick stuff, that’ll be one heck of a chip to face. Thompson responds by aiming for the middle of the green. No point looking for trouble. Another birdie for Angel Yin! She steers a right-to-left slider into the cup at 9 from 20 feet, and hits the turn in 31. She grabs a share of second with Feng and Saso at -3. They all should be joined by Yin’s playing partner Megan Khang, but the young Californian pulls a short birdie effort and admonishes herself in the theatrical style. Thompson, at the back of 7 in regulation, cradles her long birdie putt to kick-in distance. No need to race heroically at the hole with a five-shot advantage over Feng ... and Saso, who begins to repair all that early damage by draining a 25-footer for her first birdie of the day. -8: Thompson (7) -3: Feng (7), Saso (7) -2: Yin (8), Khang (8) An up-and-down few minutes for the penultimate group. Nasa Hataoka bounces back from double bogey on 6 with birdie at 7. She’s -1, as is Jeongeun Lee6, whose putter has proved problematic all week; three putts on 7 and the 2019 winner is heading in the wrong direction today, two over for her round. The third member of the group, Shanshan Feng, pars both holes in her usual steady style, though nearly drained a long birdie effort on 7. She remains five off at -3. Brooke Henderson is having a good day. Birdies at 5 and now 8 have brought her up to level par for the tournament. How the 2016 PGA champion will rue that inexplicable second round of 78. She’s been on top of her game otherwise, posting 68 on Thursday and 69 yesterday. Meanwhile back on 6, pars for Thompson (-8), Ganne (+2) and Saso (-2). Angel Yin already has a second-place finish at the US Open to her name. The 22-year-old from LA came in behind Jeongeun Lee6 at Charleston in 2019, and she’s bothering the top end of the leaderboard again. Having birdied 1, she sends her second at the short par-four 7th into thick rough down the left. No bother! Out comes the wedge, and she flips onto the green, her ball rattling into the cup at a very satisfying velocity. She joins the group tied for third at -2. A huge smile plays across Thompson’s face as she reacts to that sensational shot. She’s really enjoying herself this week, explaining that she’s been trying to rein in the intensity, to the point of her being more than happy to stop and sign autographs during her round. In goes the birdie putt, and she’s in total control of this US Open right now. Nothing’s over yet, mind you, as the experience of Arnold Palmer, who lost a seven-stroke lead here on the back nine to Billy Casper in the 1966 men’s version, will amply illustrate. -8: Thompson (5) -3: Feng (5) -2: Khang (6), Hataoka (5), Lee6 (5), Saso (5) One of the shots of the week by Lexi Thompson! She’s out of position down the left of 5, in thick rough, a low-hanging branch in the road. She whips out, sending the ball wide right before drawing it back into the front of the green. It bumbles up to a couple of feet, one of those lovely, serene, inevitable golfing journeys. She’ll have that to go five clear of Shanshan Feng. Another wild drive by Ganne, and she’s forced to pitch out sideways from behind a tree at 5. A little backwards, in fact. She had no other shot. Having found the fairway, she arrows her third at the flag, but the ball takes one bounce into thick greenside rough and disappears. One yard longer, and that would have been very close. She holds her head in her hands. It’s all good experience from the university of life, before she goes to actual university at Stanford. Lee6 gets up and down from distance at 5 to limit the damage to bogey. A lovely sand wedge in from 80 yards to ten feet. Her second spot is taken by Shanshan Feng, who has been going along very steadily: 15 pars yesterday, four to start today, and now birdie at 5. Pars all round at 4 in the final group. These are the only players now under par for this tournament: -7: Thompson (4) -3: Feng (5) -2: Khang (5), Hataoka (5), Lee6 (5), Saso (4) To illustrate how difficult the Lake Course is playing today, only 12 players from a field of 66 are in red figures for their round. Only two of that dozen are more than one shot to the good: Celine Herbin (through 7, +1 overall) and last year’s joint runner-up Amy Olsen (through 6, level par overall). This will be Herbin’s best performance in a major by far; the 38-year-old from France’s previous best is a tie for 46th at the PGA. Lee6, currently No2, hooks her tee shot at 5 into big trouble. The thickest rough, from which she barely advances her ball an inch. Take two finds the fairway. Bogey will be a good score from here. Back on 4, Thompson splits the fairway, then arrows her second to 12 feet. She’ll have a great look at birdie, and everything is falling into place for the 2014 Dinah Shore champion here. Megan Khang would be an extremely popular winner. When it was all turning to dust on the back nine yesterday, she battled on with a smile, and that birdie / scrambled par finish, both holes celebrated in carefree style, might stand her in good stead. That’s because, having bogeyed 2, she’s gone on to birdie 3 and now 5, rolling in from 30 feet, to join the group at -2. A huge putt here for Thompson, who gently strokes her 12-footer into the cup to scramble par. All of a sudden, she’s got a four-stroke lead ... over Lee6. Saso makes it back-to-back doubles after pushing her bogey putt wide right. Par for Ganne, stopping the rot to great acclaim. -7: Thompson (3) -3: Lee6 (4) -2: Hataoka (4), Feng (4), Saso (3) Thompson chips her second straight at the flag, but it’s not firm enough and she’s left with a 12-footer for par. Saso’s stuttering start continues as she blasts high out of the sand, but a good 25-feet past the hole. She leaves the long par putt five feet short, too. Ganne meanwhile hangs around patiently as the pair go about their business, having settled herself with a lovely tee shot over the flag to six feet. “That was so bad.” Thompson reacts to her 8-iron into the par-three 3rd, which she hits heavy, her ball ending way short of the green and to the right. She’s not in quite so much trouble as Saso, who dunks her effort into a deep bunker. The leading pair are dragging each other down at the minute. It’s not easy closing out a major championship, is it. Saso’s chip into 2, her fourth, isn’t all that, leaving a 30-foot putt for bogey. She very nearly rolls it in, but the ball sticks on the lip. A double. Ganne’s third from the fringe rolls 12 feet past, and results in a bogey. A double bogey, bogey start for the 17-year-old amateur. The crowd fall sadly silent as their young hero slips to level par. Thompson also drops a stroke, failing to get up and down from the front, her saver stopping a dimple short, just like Ganne’s. -7: Thompson (2) -4: Saso (2) -3: Lee6 (3) -2: Hataoka (3), Feng (3) -1: Stark (4), Khang (4) E: Olson (5), Yin (4), Ganne (2) While the 2nd takes chunks out of the final group, the Swedish amateur Maja Stark rolls in a 15-footer on 4 for another birdie. She’s -1. Then back on 3, Lee6 bounces back from bogey by snaking in a monster putt from off the front of 4. That’s a real momentum shifter! She’s back to -3, and may find herself even closer to the leaders in a couple of minutes’ time. Lexi, in the rough on the other side of the hole, follows Ganne in sending a chaser towards the front of the green. It’s about all either player could do. Finally it’s the turn of Saso, who appears to be in about 22 minds about what to do. She eventually hacks through the thick nonsense, but only manages to advance her ball 50 yards or so, still in the deep rough. She can only hack back out to the fairway, and will need to get up and down from 50 yards for bogey. Saso’s ball is snagged in all sorts of Olympic-standard filth. Halfway up a bank, too. She’s got to decide whether to take her medicine and chip out sideways, or just go for the green with one big gouge. She’s got the power, it might be worth going for it, given there’s no certainty in the sensible option either. A big moment coming up, early doors. She’d take bogey now, if offered, you’d imagine. Ganne meanwhile only just missed the fairway with her drive, but the rough is so lush, she does extremely well to chase her ball up to the fringe. That wasn’t a great putt by Thompson, in truth. A bit off the toe, the ball squirting a couple of crucial millimetres to the right. She sends her drive at 2 into the first cut down the left. Not ideal, but nowhere near as bad as Saso, who sends a huge slice miles right. By all accounts she’s modelled her swing on Rory McIlroy, whose recent major-championship travails open up a world of comedic possibility here. Up on the green, it’s a three-putt bogey for Lee6. Thompson tickles her putt up to the lip, but it stubbornly refuses to drop. No matter, that’s an opening birdie and she’s extended her lead over Saso, who does well to get up and down from the back. Ganne can’t manage it, though, and it’s a double-bogey seven. A nightmare start for the young amateur, who flings her putter onto her bag in her first show of frustration all week. -8: Thompson (1) -6: Saso (1) -3: Lee6 (1) -2: Hataoka (1), Feng (1) -1: Ganne (1) Saso lays up at 1, only to send her wedge over the back of the green. Ganne - who doesn’t hang about, playing at the sort of speed that would make Brooks look like Bryson - clips what seems a perfectly judged fourth towards the flag, but it keeps on rolling and topples off alongside Saso. “Aw come on!” shouts someone in the crowd. The gallery has had her back all week, and they’re not about to abandon the effervescent amateur now. Ganne has been ice-cool all week, but the nerves may have finally caught up with her. She’s forced to take her medicine and chip back out onto the 1st fairway, then slices her third into the gallery down the right. It’s a complete contrast to the way Thompson is playing the hole: she takes advantage of her big drive by lashing a long iron straight at the flag, the ball rolling serenely to ten feet or so, setting up an eagle chance. As statements of intent go, that’s a doozy. The putter often goes cold on Thompson; if she makes this, she might decide that it’s going to be her day. Birdie for Nasa Hataoka on the 1st. Pars for Shanshan Feng and Jeongeun Lee6, the latter knocking in a six-foot saver that should give her succour after yesterday’s putting woes. The flat stick has been letting the 2019 winner down this week. Here comes the marquee grouping! The 17-year-old amateur Megha Ganne is up first. A slightly nervous smile turns into a broad one as the gallery welcome her with a huge cheer. She was a bit wayward off the tee yesterday, and that continues here as she sends her drive well right. Yuka Saso is up next. She was also all over the shop with the big stick yesterday, but her first drive splits the fairway. Finally it’s the leader Lexi Thompson. She’s not won on Tour for nearly two years, so some nerves would be understandable, but she obliterates one down the track. That’s gone miles. Everyone’s out, then. This is on! Megan Khang needs a fast start today. She was right up there yesterday afternoon, until four consecutive bogeys between 13 and 16 sent her crashing down the leaderboard. Her spirit didn’t break, though, and she celebrated birdie at 17 with a smile and an ironic celebration, then did the same, with added laughter, upon draining a par saver on the last. The only way to respond to a nightmare back nine, as she came home in 40. She immediately sets up a straight 15-foot birdie chance this morning, but pulls it wide left. So much for springing out of the blocks. She remains at -1. In just about any other year - one without the sensational antics of Megha Ganne - we’d all be talking about Maja Stark. The 21-year-old amateur from Sweden has been hovering on the periphery this week, posting rounds of 71, 70 and 73. She’s birdied 1 this morning, too, and currently stands at level par for the tournament. As things stand, she’s tied for eighth place. Normally this is nosebleed territory for an amateur, but Stark has been there, done that: she tied for 13th on debut last year. Before the leading contenders take to the stage, word of the first-round leader Mel Reid. A 67 on Thursday sparked talk of a possible maiden major for the 33-year-old from Derby. She looked focused, bang in the zone, a study in determination. But all that intensity must have been mentally exhausting. A disappointing 73 on Friday, then a strange 78 yesterday that variously featured a shank, a whiffed chip and a hole-out from 100 yards for eagle. Out of contention, she’s already carded a couple of bogeys today, at 2 and 4, and has slipped down to +7. But when it all comes down, this week should give her plenty of confidence going forward. As a late bloomer in the majors, compared to your Lexis, Inbees and Lydias, she’s trending in the right direction. Glory soon? The tee times for the final groups at the business end of this US Open, then. All BST. 5.59pm: Kim Hyo-joo, Maja Stark (a), Brooke Henderson 6.11pm: Megan Khang, Inbee Park, Angel Yin 6.23pm: Jeongeun Lee6, Shanshan Feng, Nasa Hataoka 6.35pm: Lexi Thompson, Yuka Saso, Megha Ganne (a) It almost defies belief that Lexi Thompson has only one major title to her name. When she won the Kraft Nabisco in 2014 at 19, it was assumed that she’d start racking up the slams with Sorenstamian regularity. But for one reason and another, it’s never quite happened. Three second places in the majors, three thirds, 16 top-ten finishes. It’s about that time, and yesterday’s flawless 66 was carpe-diem stuff. This is the first time she’s led the US Open after any round, a stat that might not say much about most 26-year-olds, but Thompson first played in this tournament in 2007 at the precocious age of 12. This is her 15th consecutive appearance. Is she finally going to land major number two? Yuka Saso is best placed to stop her. The powerful Filipino spent most of yesterday’s round driving like Seve, but no matter, thanks to her ability to gouge back into position, as though the penal Olympic Club rough wasn’t there, and her scrambling skills around the greens; she chips a bit like Seve, too. If she wins today, she’ll join Inbee Park as the only teenage winner of the US Open. Park won in 2008 at 19 years, 11 months and 17 days; that’s Saso’s exact age today. Some things seem written. Or could Megha Ganne become only the second amateur to win the US Open, matching the feat of Catherine Lacoste in 1967? The 17-year-old from New Jersey received vociferous support from the gallery yesterday, at one point getting to within a shot of the lead. When asked for her secret, she smiled: “I figure why not make it fun?” She’s the real deal. Some big names are lurking, including 2019 champion Jeongeun Lee6, 2012 PGA winner Shanshan Feng, major champs in waiting Nasa Hataoka and Megan Khang, and seven-time major winner Inbee Park. Should Thompson and Saso hit their stride, it will be a two-woman race, but anything can happen at Olympic Club, and it can happen to the best of them: just ask Arnold Palmer, who lost a seven-stroke lead on the back nine to Billy Casper in the 1966 men’s version. The final round of the 76th US Women’s Open is very much on.

The new measures will be effective from Monday morning. Reuters reports, Most of the new restrictions, Museveni said, would be implemented for 42 days. An assessment of their impact will then help the government decide whether to ease or prolong them, he added. Uganda implemented one of Africa’s tightest lockdowns at the beginning of the pandemic more than a year ago, but it was gradually lifted as cases slowed to a trickle. Last month however infections started to spike and new cases, particularly among younger people, have surged, fuelling fears that the country could slip into an out-of-control second wave. Museveni said in a televised address on Sunday night that a second wave gripping the country was “diffuse and sustained”. The government, he said, was worried the jump in cases would ‘exhaust the available bed space and oxygen supply in hospitals unless we constitute urgent public health measures.’ “In this wave the intensity of severe and critically ill Covid-19 patients and death is higher than what we experienced in the first wave of the pandemic,” he said. Covid-19 infections in Uganda are on an average daily basis at their peak, with 825 new infections reported each day, according to a Reuters analysis. From January to April the positivity rate in tested samples was mostly below 3% but the rate started climbing sharply last month, hitting 18% on June 2, according to Ministry of Health data. The east African country has thus far reported nearly 53,000 positive cases and 383 deaths. The new restrictions potentially threaten to arrest an already fragile economic recovery from the blow inflicted by last year’s lockdown. Those restrictions contributed to a 1.1% economic contraction in 2020, but the finance ministry had projected before Sunday’s new measures that growth would climb to between 4-5% in the fiscal year starting July. The US has administered 301,638,578 Covid-19 jabs and distributed 371,520,735 doses as of Sunday morning, the CDC said. The latest figures are up from the 300,268,730 vaccine doses the CDC said had been administered by 5 June out of 371,520,975 doses delivered. The agency also said 170,833,221 people had received at least one dose while 138,969,323 people are fully vaccinated as of Sunday. Staff of a senate committee investigating the handling of the pandemic in Brazil have said that the Copa America football tournament should not be held amid the world’s second deadliest outbreak and must be postponed. Brazil was announced as host of the Copa America competition after joint-host Colombia was removed because of civil unrest and Argentina pulled out owing to a surge in Covid-19 cases. In a letter to the national football team, the senate commission said the country had only vaccinated 10.77% of the population until Friday with first doses. The commission said: “Brazil does not offer sanitary security for holding an international tournament of this magnitude. In addition to transmitting a false sense of security and normality, opposite to the reality that Brazilians are living, it would encourage agglomerations of people and set a bad example. “We are not against Copa America in Brazil or anywhere else. But we believe the tournament can wait until the country is ready to host it.” Reuters reports that the letter added that not holding the tournament in the country or participating in it would be a gesture of those who have lost their lives to the pandemic. The letter came two days after the captain of the Brazil football team said the squad would be making a statement on Tuesday about whether or not they want to compete in the competition. Brazilian media reports said the players do not want to play in a hastily arranged tournament due to kick off in a week while they are busy playing to qualify for the World Cup next year. After more than 15 months in varying degrees of lockdown, the US is finally ready to reopen this summer – and the signs are that plenty of people are beginning to emerge into the light, with their wallets loaded and their hearts seeking song, dance and travel. Sixty-three per cent of US adults have now received at least one vaccine dose, and as life returns to “normal”, hotels and concerts are selling out, rental cars and rental homes are booked up, and visits to museums and events are soaring. The rebound is happening so fast it’s being compared to the Roaring 20s when people came out from the gloom of a devastating flu pandemic and a global war to foxtrot and make merry. But there is a catch. Prices of some goods are soaring as shortages of lumber, chicken, and other products meet higher demand, stoking fears of inflation. A key inflation indicator – the personal consumption expenditures index – rose to 3.1% in April from a year earlier as price pressures built. And as restaurants and bars welcome back revellers, many are struggling to hire staff to cope with the demand. So far, however, rising prices have not dampened people’s enthusiasm for events and trips. In Tennessee, tickets for the Bonnaroo music festival sold out in record time, as did the Electric Daisy and Rolling Loud festivals, held in Las Vegas and Miami, respectively, as musicians and artists return to touring after more than a year of staying home. The 100,000 tickets for the Astroworld festival in Houston sold out in 30 minutes, its organizer said. “Fans are buying tickets, and events are selling out faster than ever,” Michael Rapino, chief executive of the Live Nation ticket company, said this month. “We’re just seeing demand beyond any other historic moment.” More on the story by Adam Gabbatt and Sajina Shrestha in New York, here: The US will donate 750,000 vaccine doses to Taiwan, a cross-party delegation of US senators said as they arrived in the country. AFP report that the high-profile delegation and gift come as Taiwan accuses China of hampering its efforts to secure enough doses as part of Beijing’s ongoing campaign to keep the island isolated. Morocco will reopen its airports to international traffic starting from 15 June to help the return of its nationals living abroad, the country’s foreign ministry said on Sunday. Foreign nationals will also be allowed into the country if they have been vaccinated against Covid-19 or had a negative PCR test. According to a tally compiled by AFP, since the outbreak first emerged in December 2019, at least 3,723,381 people have died from Covid-19. The US is the worst affected country, with 597,377 deaths from 33,357,240 cases. The next hardest-hit countries are Brazil with 472,531 deaths, India with 346,759, Mexico with 228,754 and Peru with 186,073. The WHO estimates the pandemic’s overall toll could be two to three times higher than official records because of the excess mortality directly and indirectly linked to Covid-19. Sunday is the first day for 12-16-year-olds in Israel to get vaccinated, after 55% of the population have so far received two doses in the country. The move to vaccinate teenagers came despite the country’s health ministry recently releasing finding that suggests a “possible link” between the Pfizer/BioNTech jab and cases of myocarditis – inflammation of the heart muscle – among younger men. Ministers are ‘absolutely open’ to delaying the 21 June reopening date in England if the Delta variant worsens the country’s recovery prospects, the health secretary said. Matt Hancock, in what is thought to be the clearest indication yet that the target date could be missed, stressed that 21 June was a “not before” date and that it was only “pencilled in” as the next step out of lockdown, PA reports. The minister also implied that social distancing could continue beyond the final stage of the roadmap. Pushed on whether the removal of restrictions date could be postponed if the Delta variant data “gets bad”, Hancock told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: “We are absolutely open to doing that if that’s what needs to happen. “We said in the roadmap that June 21 is the date by which we would not take Step 4 before that date and that we would look at the data. “That is exactly what we are doing, so the roadmap was set up in order to be able to take these sort of changes into account.” As of Sunday, 27,957,453 people received their first dose in France, and 13,709,004 people have completed their vaccine cycle. The country also reported 5,070 new Covid-19 cases. France recorded 25 new deaths and 2 new ICU admissions on Sunday. The latest figures are added to a total of 83,572 deaths in hospital since the pandemic began and 2,527 people currently in the hospital for Covid-19. Health experts remain divided over the dangers posed by the new Delta variant of Covid-19 and the risks it poses to the nation as ministers consider whether or not to lift lockdown later this month. Some argue that the new variant, first identified in India, is a significantly increased threat to the UK and have urged that delays be imposed on the total removal of social restrictions, due on 21 June. “By the government’s own criteria, it would be foolish now to proceed on the data that we’ve got. The risk would be very great indeed,’ said Professor Stephen Reicher, a member of the Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours (SPI-B) which advises the government. Reicher said the current assessment of the risks not being fundamentally changed by the appearance of the Delta variant was “not upheld”. This view was backed by scientists of the Independent Sage group, who argued that data indicated the Delta variant had higher infectivity and was more likely to cause disease and hospitalisations. “That makes it very difficult to justify progressing with the last stage of lockdown,” the group said last week. Other scientists believe such calls are premature. While urging caution, they say fears that the Delta variant poses a significant new threat – both in terms of infectivity and as a cause of serious illness – are premature. “The suggestion that the India variant is more pathogenic needs to be taken with a big dose of salt,” said Ian Jones, professor of virology, Reading University. More on the story here: Italy recorded 51 deaths and 2,275 new cases on Sunday, the health ministry has said. The latest figures are down from yesterday’s 57 deaths and 2,436 cases. Patients in hospital with Covid-19, not including those in intensive care, were recorded at 4,963 on Sunday, down from 5,193 a day earlier. There were 20 new admissions to intensive care units, unchanged from Saturday. The total number of intensive care patients fell to 774 from a previous 788. Since the pandemic began in February, Italy has registered 126,523 coronavirus-related deaths, the second-highest toll in Europe after Britain and the eight-highest in the world. Portugal’s prime minister has criticised Britain for removing the country from the green list, allowing travellers to visit Portugal without quarantine on return. On Sunday, Antonio Costa urged London to adhere to a European digital certificate scheme to ease travel. Last week, Britain announced it was removing Portugal from its green list because of rising Covid-19 case numbers and the risk posed by coronavirus variants detected in Portugal. Costa told reporters, “We can’t have this system of instability and changes every three weeks.It isn’t good for those who plan their holidays, nor for those who have to organise the tourism industry to receive tourists in good conditions.” Costa adds that Portugal was maintaining a dialogue with the British government to “explain the decision is not justified and also the serious damage it causes to the British and to the Portuguese economy.” Reuters reports that under the proposed European digital certificate scheme, which the EU plan to introduce from 1 July, EU citizens who can prove they have been vaccinated against Coivd-19, tested negative for the disease or recovered from it will be able to travel freely in the bloc. However, the prime minister did not explain how Britain would adhere to the scheme after leaving the EU. The Covid-19 situation in Portugal has seen a slight increase in positive cases since lifting lockdown restrictions last month. Hospitalisations remain low and daily deaths are near zero following the vaccination of nearly all its most vulnerable elderly citizens. Hi, I’m Edna Mohamed; I’ll be taking over from my colleague Harry Taylor for the rest of the afternoon. If I miss anything, you can message me on Twitter or drop me an email at edna.mohamed.casual@theguardian.com The UK records 5,341 positive coronavirus cases on Sunday and four new deaths, according to government data. This is an increase of 2,101 on last Sunday when 3,111 cases were reported. While daily deaths are down -1% in the last seven days, case numbers are up by 11,022 (49.0%) in the same period. Here’s a round-up of today’s latest coronavirus news from around the world: Eradicating Covid-19 worldwide is not a “reasonable target”, according to a World Health Organization envoy on the virus. Dr David Nabarro said people will have to learn to live with the virus in circulation. Boris Johnson has outlined his ambition to see the planet vaccinated by the end of 2022, ahead of the G7 summit in Cornwall starting on Friday. He will also call for a global watch system to identify new variants. Countries in the Asia-Pacific region are looking to develop their home-grown vaccines as supply shortages threaten efforts to tackle the pandemic. UK health secretary Matt Hancock says it’s “too early” to make a final decision on whether there will be a delay to restrictions being relaxed on 21 June. Former UK prime minister Tony Blair has called for the rules to be relaxed for people who have had both doses of the vaccine, and for Covid-certification for travel. More than 57m doses of Covid-19 vaccines have been given to people in England, latest NHS England data shows. Nearly 23.5 million people have had both doses of the vaccine, with 33.7 million having had at least one jab. UK government ministers are considering giving people a different type of Covid vaccine as an autumn booster, after early results from “mix and match” trials appeared to show promise for an enhanced immune response. Russia has reported 9,145 new Covid-19 cases and a further 399 deaths. A total of 5,117,274 people have tested positive and 123,436 have died. Russia’s own statistics service suggests the actual number to die from the virus may be higher. Germany has registered 2,440 new cases in the last 24 hours, and 24.7 cases per 100,000 people, according to the country’s Robert Koch Institute. A further 74 people have died from the virus, meaning the death toll stands at 89,222. No deaths have been reported from Covid in Wales for the tenth day in a row, according to the latest public health statistics. A total of 92 new cases have been confirmed, bringing the number of infections recorded in the country to 213,091. 5,569 people have died. Campaigners have criticised Boris Johnson for his “audacity” in calling for the world’s population to be vaccinated by the end of next year (see 08:31), accusing him of blocking attempts to scale up production. Global Justice Now said the UK is one of the countries, along with Germany, which is stopping an intellectual property waiver on vaccines and treatments at the World Trade Organization. India and South Africa first proposed a waiver eight months ago, but some countries have obstructed it. The US said last month it would support a waiver. The director of the charity, Nick Dearden, said: “The audacity of Boris Johnson preaching about the need to vaccinate the world is staggering. The UK is one of the last remaining countries blocking an intellectual property waiver on Covid-19 vaccines. “Simply setting a deadline is not leadership. If the prime minister wants to achieve global vaccination by 2022, he should follow in Joe Biden’s footsteps and support an intellectual property waiver on Covid-19 vaccines and treatments.” More than 57 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines have now been given to people in the UK, latest NHS England data shows. The total – 57,193,641 jabs – include both first and second jabs. The latest figures show a total of 590,645 people were vaccinated yesterday. Nearly 23.5 million people have had both doses of the vaccine, with 33.7 million having had at least one jab. Ministers are considering giving people a different type of Covid vaccine as an autumn booster, it has emerged, after early results from “mix and match” trials appeared to show promise for an enhanced immune response. Four different coronavirus jabs have been approved for use in the UK, with more under regulatory review. While people are currently offered two doses of the same jab, researchers have been exploring whether offering a second dose of a different Covid vaccine could generate a stronger immune response. It is also expected that people will be offered a third, “booster” injection, potentially in the autumn, in part to protect them against variants with some resistance to existing vaccines. One possibility being looked at is that this third jab could be of a different type to people’s initial two, a government source said. Trials worldwide are exploring the impact of max and match doses. In the UK, the Com-Cov study, launched in February, is investigating the possibility of using the Oxford/AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax vaccines. The Sunday Telegraph reported promising results from separate trials of more than 600 people in Spain and 300 in Germany. Matt Hancock has formally denied the claim from Dominic Cummings that he incorrectly promised people discharged from hospitals to care homes were being tested for Covid at the start of the pandemic, saying: “No, I did not.” The rejection, after lengthy questioning on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, follows the health secretary’s previous refusal to deny explicitly the claim in the Commons and at a Downing Street press conference, a day after Cummings’ explosive claims to MPs. But in an indication of Hancock’s likely approach when he is quizzed by the same parliamentary committee on Thursday, he argued that Cummings had not in fact accused him of wrongly claiming tests were already being done in March last year – only that they would happen when testing capacity was available. Eradicating Covid-19 from the world is not currently a “reasonable target”, a World Health Organization Covid-19 official has said. Dr David Nabarro, a special envoy to the WHO, said people will have to learn to live with the disease, comments which were echoed by Dame Anne Johnson, a professor of infection disease epidemiology at University College London (UCL). Nabarro told Sky News’ Trevor Phillips on Sunday: “Humanity is going to have to learn how to co-exist with this virus, preventing it from spiking and then surging and causing hotspots of disease, and we’re going to have to be able to do this for the foreseeable future. “Eradication is not currently a reasonable target for the world.” He said: “Each time there is a sudden surge, it does stimulate in one’s mind the thought that there might be a new variant appearing. That wouldn’t be surprising.” He said that will be “the pattern for the future”, adding: “This virus isn’t going away any time soon, there will be variants emerging.” A Dublin pub landlord has said the hospitality industry in Ireland faces difficulties replacing staff who left during the pandemic. Kevin Barden, whose family owns the traditional Irish music pub O’Donoghue’s, told PA Media he has been fortunate to welcome back 19 of his 20-strong team after 15 months of closure. Others have struggled to recruit staff and are finding it hard to fill roles ahead of reopening. “We’ve only lost one for the moment and hopefully we’ll get him back by the end of the summer. So we’ve been lucky enough – we’ve retained the majority of the staff here, which has been great.” Like so many workers across Ireland, the staff have received an income through government Covid-19 wage subsidy support. “They’ve obviously had to take a hit and they all have families and mortgages and bills to pay as well,” said Barden. It’s a month tomorrow since Public Health England published a report on the India variant in the UK when there were 509 identified cases. Since then the case numbers in the country have risen 20-fold and case numbers are continuing to rise. This thread from PHE expert Meaghan Kall on where things in England are now is well worth a read: Countries in the Asia-Pacific region are looking to develop their home-grown vaccines as supply shortages threaten efforts to tackle the pandemic. Japan, South Korea, India, Taiwan, Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam are hoping to develop their own jabs after struggling to get vaccines from overseas, according to the South China Morning Post. While locally developed vaccines aren’t likely to affect the pandemic in its current phase, they believe it’s a better long-term approach. Germany has registered 2,440 new cases in the last 24 hours, and 24.7 cases per 100,000 people, according to the country’s Robert Koch Institute. The latest figures show 74 more people have died from the virus, meaning the death toll now stands at 89,222. There has been a total of 3,700,367 positive tests for Covid since the start of the pandemic. The new Delta variant of coronavirus appears to be about 40% more transmissible than the variant it has largely replaced, Matt Hancock has said, making government decisions about whether to ease restrictions in England on 21 June “more difficult”. Saying that under-30s will be called to begin vaccinations from next week, the health secretary confirmed it was still possible the reopening programme could be delayed or some rules kept in place. “We consider all options,” he told Sky News. Away from the UK, Russia has reported 9,145 new Covid-19 cases and a further 399 deaths. A total of 5,117,274 people have tested positive in the country. The death toll in the country now stands at 123,436. Russia’s own state statistics service, Rosstat, keeps its own records and said on Friday that about 270,000 people had died from the virus and related causes as of April. Excess deaths in the county stand at 425,000 from between April 2020 and April 2021. Marr rounds off by asking whether the health secretary regretted using the phrase about a “protective ring” around care homes. “I said that much later about what we were doing for the winter plans, but it’s been interpreted,” he says, but changes the subject on to the return of children to school tomorrow after half-term. “On testing, tomorrow schoolchildren will be going back to school. You must get tests done this evening because right now secondary school-age children getting their tests done tonight is the most important thing that can be done today.” Marr asks whether Hancock will apologise for any failings on his part during the pandemic, as Cummings did. “At that time everybody was working as hard as possible to protect as many lives as possible on the evidence we had at the time,” he says. “This is true of different administrations and across the whole of Europe. “I know those decisions were taken on the best evidence with the best of intentions.” Marr ends by asking whether Hancock’s been honest and transparent during the pandemic after claims made by Dominic Cummings during his select committee appearance last week. He plays a clip of Cummings saying that in March 2020 Hancock said people would be tested before they went back to care homes and there was a protective shield around them. “It’s complete nonsense,” Cummings said. He asks Hancock whether he told Johnson that people would be tested before they went into care homes. He replies: “We know the testing wasn’t available to test everybody. The advice was that very few people would be able to pass on Covid if they didn’t have any symptoms, so we reserved that for people with symptoms. “The situation with regards to care homes, we brought in a policy of wanting to test everybody going into a care home as soon as we had those tests available. Everyone had a challenge around Europe, in Scotland in Wales, some of the most vulnerable to Covid live in care homes, but at the time, you’ll remember we didn’t have the testing capacity and I built that up, put in place the hundreds of thousands targets and then we could put that into place.” On the idea of children being vaccinated, Hancock says the government is following clinical advice. “There’s good advantages, there’s the reduction in transmission from children to parents and grandparents who might be vulnerable. There’s advantages in protecting education, if one child gets one positive test, the whole bubble has to isolate. “We should follow and listen to clinical advice … I don’t want to put pressure on them with their advice. People should be reassured that whatever steps we take they are on a clinically advised basis.” In response to a question about vaccine passports, or certification along the lines mentioned by Tony Blair, Hancock says: “We know some other countries are going to require it. So if you want to go some other countries, you already have to, the EU are talking about it. It’s my job to make sure you can have that. “If you download the NHS app right now and register it will show you your vaccine status, so you can prove it if you want to go to Greece, for example.” He says rules in the UK are down to a certification review and that there is downsides on a mandatory basis. Hancock repeats Sage’s findings that the India variant is 40% more transmissible. In turn Marr quotes a Sage report saying that a variant of that level of transmissibility would cause severe disruption to the roadmap. Hancock says: “We’re watching the case rates and the rate in which that transfers into hospitalisations. Thankfully that link, which was absolutely rock solid over the autumn, is severed but not broken. There are some people in hospital who have been double vaccinated, but very few. The majority in hospital haven’t been. “Critically, those who are double vaccinated, even if they’re in hospital, they appear to be less ill. The vaccine is working and is our way through it, the new variant, which is more transmissible is making that calculation harder.” Matt Hancock’s now appearing on Marr, after his earlier interview on Sky News’ Trevor Phillips on Sunday. He first responds to an earlier interview by Bob Geldof calling for more vaccines to go to developing countries. The health secretary references Boris Johnson’s call to get the planet vaccinated by the end of 2022, and the rollout of the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab at cost to low and middle income countries. The cut to the aid budget, he says, is supposed to be temporary. “We also have this enormous cost there, so we can continue investing in the NHS, which we are doing, but there’s many things we are doing, leadership on climate change and certainly the work that AZ and Oxford University have done that a quarter of the vaccines across the whole world are delivered with UK taxpayers cash, at cost, no charge on intellectual property, and that’s saving lives everywhere.” Nandy backs vaccination for children after the JCVI’s approval of the Pfizer jab for 12-15 year olds. “I think the regulator has been clear that for 12-year-olds and over the Pfizer vaccine is safe and it’s apparent that the rise in transmission rates is being driven by young people. “It’s right to follow the public health officials particularly the ones that are saying ‘this is what we want to do’. “If public health directors are saying ‘we’ve got a problem in our secondary schools and we need to open up the vaccine, not to make it mandatory, offer the chance to get them vaccinated’, then we need to listen. If we’d taken that approach from the start we’d be in a far better place now.” On international travel Nandy says she believes the current Amber list for international travel from the UK should be scrapped. Current rules mean people travelling to the UK from those countries must quarantine at home or the place they are staying for 10 days and take two Covid tests during that period. She adds: “It’s confusing and that confusion is dangerous at the moment and risks unravelling all the progress that we’ve made. “I think we should have robust quarantine measures for people coming back into the country. “We need to be much clearer that at the moment travelling overseas, particularly when you’ve got countries like Vietnam and Thailand on the amber list where new variants are emerging and being imported into the UK, is the wrong thing to do and the government ought to be clear about that.” Labour’s shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy tells Marr says she’s sceptical on a domestic level on vaccine passports. “I think the global case for vaccine passports is clear because other countries are doing it, but at a domestic level for many of the reasons that you’ve highlighted, discriminatory practices, how they would be enforced, I think there are potentially real problems.” Here’s more detail on the proposal put forward by the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change. People who have been vaccinated against Covid-19 should be able to travel abroad using a new digital pass and go to “vaccine-only” venues such as restaurants or sports stadiums, Tony Blair says today. Releasing a report entitled “Less Risk, More Freedom”, by the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, the former prime minister says the time has come “to distinguish for the purposes of freedom from restriction between the vaccinated and unvaccinated”. The report argues that to date, measures intended to reduce the spread of disease have treated populations as largely homogenous groups. As a result, restrictions – such as national lockdowns, regional-tier systems and entire schools closed following outbreaks – have been blunt instruments. Tony Blair’s on BBC One’s Andrew Marr Show. He says he thinks it’s “uncertain” as to whether the UK will carry on with rules being relaxed on 21 June. Marr says that with introducing vaccine passports or certification status, it will end up discriminating against people who have not had the jab. Blair replies: “Discrimination has got a very loaded meaning in the English Language now. Really when it comes to risk management it’s all about discrimination. The reason we vaccinate the elderly first is that they are more at risk. The reason we ensure people are vaccinated is that we reduce the risk of transmission.” In response to a follow-up question, the former prime minister adds that there needs to be exemptions made for certain groups, including the disabled, as it would be “totally inappropriate” to discriminate against them. Taiwan reported 343 new Covid-19 cases on Sunday, down from 511 reported the day before. The US announced on Sunday that it will give it 750,000 vaccine doses. Phillips asks if we could be giving more vaccines to other countries ahead of the G7 summit next week. Hancock says: “My first duty is to protect the UK population, and that’s to reduce transmission. The way we’re helping the rest of the world is giving away at cost the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine and that means of the 2 billion doses delivered across the world, 500m doses are the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. 70% of those doses are in low and middle-income countries. “The reason we’ve been able to do this is is that we’ve made it available at cost, no charge of intellectual property from the start. I’m delighted there’s a debate, around the G7 table on how to vaccinate the world, but this country has done more than any other by ensuring the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is available at cost.” Responding on whether the government will respond to Blair’s call earlier (see 8.19), for global vaccine passports, as well as relaxations domestically for people who have had the jab. Hancock says: “This debate has been going on for months and we’ve been doing the work inside government, and we’ll be coming out with our answers on that soon. “We know it’s going to be needed internationally, on the domestic front, that’s a matter for Michael Gove.” Phillips asks if the government will want to vaccinate all children. The UK regulator, Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, approved the Pfizer jab for use on children aged between 12 and 15 earlier this week. A story in the Sunday Telegraph said that under plans drawn up by Whitehall, they would be offered the jab from mid-August. Hancock doesn’t rule it out, and says: “We’ve got a few weeks until we come out with a plan on how and if we take this forward. “We know the vaccine both protects you and helps stops it transmitting, and I want to protect education as much as anybody does. Making sure we don’t have those whole bubbles going home and the isolation, that has big upsides for education.” Under-30s in England will be invited to get their jabs this week, Hancock adds, as he says the link between infection and serious illness has been “severed but not broken” by the vaccine. Phillips asks whether there will be a modification of the roadmap, such as lifting lockdown but still asking people to work from home. “There are a series of things at the moment that we’ve said will be part of step four, which include the rule of six and the fact there’s still some businesses that are closed. “We have four reviews into international travel and certification and social distancing, and we are concluding those reviews and doing that at the same time.” Hancock urges people to go and get their second dose to try and stop the damage being caused by the India variant, that is 40% more transmissible. “It’s more difficult to manage this virus with the new variant. But after two doses of vaccine we are confident that you get the same protection as you did with the old variant. “The vaccine works just as effectively, and everyone must get their second jab though, as the first on its own isn’t quite as effective.” The health secretary Matt Hancock is on Sky News’ Trevor Phillips on Sunday, as part of a morning broadcast tour. He asks Hancock whether there will be a delay to the relaxing of restrictions on 21 June. “It’s too early to make a final decision on that,” Hancock begins. “The prime minister and the team will be looking over all the data over this week and we’ve said we will be giving people enough time ahead of 21 June when this is pencilled in, this next step.” He says it will depend on the four tests; cases, hospitalisations, the rollout of the vaccine and the impact of new variants. Hancock admits that there has been a significant impact of the Delta variant. Boris Johnson will urge G7 leaders to “defeat Covid” by vaccinating the world by the end of next year. The prime minister will stress the importance of the programme when he meets leaders on Friday in Cornwall for the first face-to-face G7 meeting since the beginning of the pandemic. The US, France, Germany, Italy and Japan have all said how many doses they will donate to the global vaccine programme, Covax. However the UK and Canada are yet to announce how many they will contribute. Johnson will also call for a global watch system to catch new variants before they spread more widely. Johnson said: “I’m calling on my fellow G7 leaders to join us to end this terrible pandemic and pledge will we never allow the devastation wreaked by coronavirus to happen again.” Head of the UK vaccines taskforce Kate Bingham is to be given a damehood, the Telegraph has reported, after getting the UK access to millions of doses of six different jabs. Her expected honour is among a number in next week’s Queen’s Birthday honours dedicated to “heroes” in the pandemic. Bingham was appointed to the role in May last year and left at the end of 2020. People who have had both doses of a Covid-19 vaccine should have restrictions relaxed for them, according to former prime minister Tony Blair. Blair’s thinktank, the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, sets out how the country should remain open if the virus persists in the population. The report, Less Risk, More Freedom, says that the NHS app – which is currently used for contact tracing – should be replaced with a system of global health passes. “The health pass needs to be usable both by national border authorities and other organisations within countries. It should also include the ability to demonstrate time-restricted testing status for those who aren’t able to be vaccinated. “With this ability to securely prove vaccination status, we can move beyond blunt, catch-all tools and align with other countries by removing certain restrictions for the fully vaccinated – thereby enabling us to sustainably reopen the economy,” the report says.

On a day when a section of the crowd booed the players taking the knee before kick-off again, confusion reigned when Calvert-Lewin won his side’s second penalty. England’s designated takers, Marcus Rashford and James Ward-Prowse, were off the pitch at the time and Southgate was unhappy when Henderson saw his spot-kick saved after taking the ball off Calvert-Lewin. “I was expecting Dominic to take it and when Hendo walked over I thought he was making sure that happened, so I will have to check what happened,” England’s manager said. “We will pull rank next time. “Marcus and James Ward-Prowse were the two nominated at the start of the game and they’d both come off.

Finance ministers in London from the G7 group of wealthy nations, including representatives of the UK, US and EU, on Saturday agreed the landmark deal aimed at making the biggest companies such as Apple, Microsoft, Google and Facebook pay more tax. The two “pillars” of the deal would make companies pay a percentage of their profits in markets where they make large sales despite minimal corporate presence, as well as setting an unprecedented global minimum corporation tax. However, a communique from G7 ministers said that they envisaged pillar one would only apply on “profit exceeding a 10% margin for the largest and most profitable multinational enterprises”, a restriction that could rule out Amazon. Amazon is one of the largest businesses in the world, with a market value of $1.6tn (£1.1tn) and sales of $386bn in 2020. It paid zero corporation tax in Europe in 2020 on sales income of €44bn (£38bn), making it a prominent target for politicians campaigning for changes to the global tax system. However, its profit margin in 2020 was only 6.3%. It runs its online retail business at very low profit margins, partly because it reinvests heavily, and partly to gain market share. Richard Murphy, visiting professor of accounting at the Sheffield University management school, said the 10% profits threshold was “inappropriate” because of different business models for different companies. He added that current approaches to reporting profits in each country were “easily gamed”. “This could turn out to be a false hope unless they get the detail right,” he said. The G7 deal aimed to give momentum to talks at the larger G20 group of nations, followed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), a club of mainly wealthy nations that has led tax negotiations for a decade. Campaigners said they hoped the later negotiations would include an approach known as “segmentation”, meaning profitable parts of businesses would pay tax in their own right. “Based on the communique Amazon is not captured,” said Paul Monaghan, chief executive of the Fair Tax Foundation, which accredits businesses that do not avoid tax. “If there’s another layer of detail that suggest Amazon will be captured that’s great, but it hasn’t emerged yet.” Janet Yellen, the US Treasury secretary, on Saturday told the Reuters news agency that she expected Facebook and Amazon to be covered by the proposal. “It will include large profitable firms and those firms, I believe, will qualify by almost any definition,” she said. A segmentation approach would mean a company like Amazon would pay tax in countries such as the UK on profits of subsidiaries such as Amazon Web Services, its lucrative web hosting arm. AWS made a margin of 30% in 2020, according to the Fair Tax Foundation. The US tech firm ended 2020 with more than $13.5bn in annual operating profits from annual AWS revenue of $45.4bn, up nearly 30% year-on-year. Sources said that while the G7 sealed an over-arching agreement, details about how to carve up the revenues of big corporations into their constituent parts for tax purposes had yet to be agreed. It is possible that some businesses will be able to re-jig their operations to offset profits against loss-making units to remain under the 10% threshold, unless tough rules are in place. Alex Cobham, chief executive of Tax Justice Network, said: “If the OECD cannot ensure Amazon is in scope, not only will it fail to meet the public demand for fairness here, it will also offer a blueprint for other major multinationals to escape this element of the reform.” Work is under way by the OECD under the banner of its inclusive framework to resolve how companies should be taxed ahead of a meeting by the G20 groups of countries in July that is expected to ratify the G7 deal. It is expected that 135 countries that have signed up to the OECD scheme will benefit from extra tax revenues from large corporations. George Turner, director of TaxWatch UK, a thinktank, said it would be vital to ascertain whether tech companies would pay more UK tax overall, after the UK and other nations including France conceded that they will remove unilateral digital services taxes that aimed to target big tech. “It could be taking with one hand and giving with the other,” Turner said. Facebook, the social network company, on Saturday said it believed it will pay more tax. However, Amazon was unable to say whether it expected to pay more tax.

In any case, where’s the dishonour in failing in a sporting run chase? Cricketers of the past would have been ashamed to watch what happened at Lord’s this afternoon.”</p> <p>Yes, it was dismal.

They struggled to score 275 on a pitch with two days’ less wear in it, and no one on either side has been able to consistently score at the asking rate. If they’re trying to build this collection of callow, skittish-intent merchants into a batting line-up capable of winning away Tests, there will be some hard, dull days along the way. I appreciate it’s not great to watch, but I find it a lot less frustrating than (yet) another series of nick-offs and a press conference about taking the positives.</p> <p>“Also, I know it was a flippant point, but I think it’s a bit tasteless to compare Root’s captaincy (which I’m no fan of), to Robinson’s past bigotry.” Ah, I didn’t mean to suggest any resemblance between them, except that both deserve a ban, for different reasons.

Today, all things being equal, England will draw their third consecutive Test at home for the first time since the late eighties. And though that’s mainly down to the weather, it also reflects a different approach and a greater resilience under Chris Silverwood. The Bayliss-era England might have thrown the towel in when they slipped to 140 for six; instead, Rory Burns and Ollie Robinson (with bat and ball) stalled New Zealand’s momentum to such an extent that they finished the day crawling along at two an over.</p> <p>New Zealand will resume on 62 for two, a lead of 165. With a maximum of 98 overs to bowl, they could still force victory on a pitch is becoming more uneven. But with a forecast for showers – of the meteorological rather than the middle-order kind – that looks unlikely. Madame de Stael said that one must choose in life between boredom and suffering. England politely request a boring last day.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-06-06T10:24:03.480Z\">at 11.24am BST</time></p>  </div>","wordcount":"10553","firstPublicationDate":"2021-06-06T09:04:15Z","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2021-06-06T20:08:35Z","liveBloggingNow":"true","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/p/hy2q7","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1b2b030f18e123a8c69ab0f690bda828de7218c/597_146_4053_2433/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","isLive":"true","bodyText":"A final email or two. “Inglorious basterds,” says Colum Fordham. “Test cricket has been full of glorious draws – if that’s not an oxymoron. Monty Panesar fending off the Aussies, the brilliant Indian rearguard effort against the Aussies earlier this year... but this match is not one of them. The only winners are New Zealand, Devon Conway and Kane Williamson. At least we can cling on to the gifted but rather embarrassing Ollie Robinson.” “Well written, Tim,” says David Pearl. Thanks! “Root deserves to be panned for this, the worst captaincy decision for half a century. He was too ‘frit’ about losing the match, even though virtually all commentators think that, if the run chase had gone wrong,they could have shut up shop after, say, six wickets. In any case, where’s the dishonour in failing in a sporting run chase? Cricketers of the past would have been ashamed to watch what happened at Lord’s this afternoon.” Yes, it was dismal. But the OBOers’ company, as ever, was very stimulating. Thanks for reading, writing and ranting, and here’s to some proper cricket when the series resumes at Edgbaston on Thursday. Here’s Joe Root. “We set out to lay a foundation. It would have been very easy to go too early today. It was a tricky wicket with a bit of up-and-down bounce, and we didn’t have the time we needed to go after that target.” Asked if he was wary because of the inexperience in the camp, he says, “More so the conditions, I think the talent’s there in the dressing-room... We had to be more disciplined, we made it harder for them to get us out, we were resilient.” On Ollie Robinson, he says, “He’s shown a lot of remorse. He’s got to learn a lot of lessons.” He’s not the only one. Is Robinson available for the next Test? “I’m not sure.” Root isn’t asked how he squares today’s timidity with his stated aim to win every Test this summer. He may face tougher questions at the press conference. The player of the match is Devon Conway. “Ah jeepers,” he says modestly, “yeah, pretty special feeling.” After growing up in South Africa, he’s clearly gone native as a Kiwi. Kane Williamson is being interviewed. He describes the game as “a really good game of cricket”. Was he surprised that England didn’t go for it? “I suppose they were trying to get a feel for it ... and to be fair, they went a long way to doing that.” Diplomatic. He points out, rightly, that a day was lost. And he pays tribute to Devon Conway., “Just looked so comfortable, played within himself, and to score a double century on debut is a brilliant feat.” He also mentions “a special performance from Tim [Southee]”. “ENGLAND SHAMBLES,” says Will Vignoles. “While this has been a somewhat dire end to a game, I do think it’s a bit ridiculous that people are now slamming Root for saying England wanted to win all the Tests this summer. What was he supposed to do, say ‘actually I’m fine only winning 50% of our Tests’ or something? Thanks for the great work as always!” It’s the yawning gap between his words and his action today that’s the problem. And we all know which of them speaks louder. “Our first Test of the summer ends in a draw,” says England Cricket on Twitter. “Great to be back @HomeofCricket in front of fans.” But not a great way to show it. You’ve got to feel for the poor old social-media team, lumped with handling the PR for this. Kane Williamson, who tried to bring the game to life with his declaration, now decides to put it out of its misery. Or ours. As the handshakes are exchanged, some jeers and boos ring out. Joe Root, I’m afraid, has made a mockery of the game and a fool of himself, after boldly announcing that he intended to win all seven Tests this summer. He’s usually a very decent guy, but he has let himself down, and he has treated the first crowd since lockdown really badly. It’s mystifying. 69th over: England 168-3 (Sibley 60, Pope 18) An apology: I’ve failed to tell you about a major milestone. Sibley has now faced 207 balls. Somehow, in all the excitement, I missed his double Dentury. Come back Denly, all is forgiven. “Watched the rugby this afternoon,” says David Hepworth, the music writer, on Twitter. “I appear to have made the right decision.” 68th over: England 166-3 (Sibley 60, Pope 17) A maiden from Santner to Sibley. Maybe Sibley’s on a secret mission: to make sure the Ashes finish 0-0. “Aside from what you owe the game, or the opponents, or the fans etc,” says V Diddy, “when you publicly declare a desire to win all seven Tests this summer you DEFINITELY have a responsibility to try to win this game.” 67th over: England 166-3 (Sibley 60, Pope 17) Pope, facing Jamieson, plays a poor shot for four, off the edge, and a good shot for none – a cut that sounds great but finds the man at backward point. And an email comes in from the scene of the crime. “As a member of the crowd,” says Sam Barnett, “I’d like to say it’s been challenging. NZ understood the meaning of the meaningless Test and set up a meaningful declaration – 3.6 an over! Instead we’ve watched an insipid, unimaginative farce. Surely Morgan’s ODI captaincy has shown that fans will accept a spirited defeat.” 66th over: England 160-3 (Sibley 59, Pope 13) Another change as Santner comes back, bearing nothing in particular. On Twitter, Jim (40th over) is back too. “Tom Adam (over 56) is right that sometimes a captain must prioritise not losing,” he concedes. “And Test cricket is a long and subtle game. But this isn’t a white ball/red ball culture clash. It’s just a bit rubbish.” This in turn draws a response from Dave, writing before Rashford’s goal. “Please try to appreciate that many of us are in our living rooms having to choose between England (cricket) trying not to score and England (football) trying not to score. Not fun. You’re at Lords. That alone is something to be grateful for.” This is true, of Jim. I’m not at Lord’s! If I was, I’d be very tempted to boo. 65th over: England 159-3 (Sibley 59, Pope 12) Southee’s body has got what it wanted – a rest. Jamieson returns, bearing dots, plus a no-ball. The lights come on at Lord’s, which is ironic because the lights will go out on Test cricket if there’s much more of this. 64th over: England 158-3 (Sibley 59, Pope 12) Wagner continues: if this had been a timeless Test, he’d have been fine with that. Pope plays a cover drive for four, which is more elegant than all the strokes Sibley has played, put together. “Afraid you’ve got this wrong Tim,” says Andrew Bennett. “1. Imagine the stick and pressure Root would get from fans and media if we lost this after the poor winter we’ve just had.” Not from me – unless he got the big decisions wrong. “2. The majority of this batting line-up just needs more time in the Test middle before the more important fixtures ahead.” That’s insulting to the New Zealanders, and to the game. “3. The fact there is a crowd has got absolutely nothing to do with how England should be playing. The fans choose to turn up to watch the players, the players aren’t there to entertain the fans.” What??? Of course they are. “How about some support for England instead? Didn’t think the Guardian OBO would turn into a Michael Vaughan echo!” I haven’t read Vaughan for a while, so don’t know quite what you mean by that, but our job is not to support England. It’s to report the game as we see it. But I do wish you and I were in agreement. Thanks for writing, anyway. 63rd over: England 150-3 (Sibley 56, Pope 7) Southee is still on, for reasons I can’t fathom. At one point in this over he pulls up in the crease, as if his body is telling us what his mind is too good-mannered to say. “The only reason to continue watching this dire display,” says Tim FG on Twitter, “is the hope that I’ll get to see the Sky box give Joe Root a seriously hard time afterwards for this dreadfully unsporting, take-the-piss-out-of-the-fans approach to avoiding a loss. Genuinely embarrassing.” At least Marcus Rashford, captaining England for the first time, is emerging with credit. 62nd over: England 149-3 (Sibley 56, Pope 6) Sibley nurdles for two. “Hi again Tim,” says Toby Miller. “This is a poignant scorecard: Boycott and Cowdrey, neither slow nor pusillanimous.” 61st over: England 147-3 (Sibley 54, Pope 6) Just a single off Southee’s over. I’ve been on the OBO at 4 in the morning, but I’ve never felt as sleepy as this. “Evening again Tim,” says David Reynolds, coming off his full run. “In response to Tom Adam [56th over], I have not the slightest interest in white-ball cricket, and I have great appreciation for patient Test-match batting. But, firstly, not a single ‘cross-bat swipe’ is necessary, let alone any ‘flurries’, to at least TRY to score 273 off 75 overs. Test-match batting is not slow batting, it is being able to adapt to the situation and change pace accordingly, in both directions. Secondly, there is nothing remotely traditional about attempting to avoid losing over winning – quite the contrary. Nobody is suggesting slogging – that was not necessary. “England could played very cautiously until tea, as they did, and then just have played busily after that, looking for runs. If they had then lost a few wickets, they could have shut up shop. No problem. Their strategy was not reasonable, it was not sporting, it was not balanced, and it was in no way traditional Test-match cricket. We were given a chance to play for a result by a captain who did not have to do it; we declined. I’ll continue clutching my pearls.” 60th over: England 145-3 (Sibley 53, Pope 6) A few singles off Wagner, whose stock has risen today – he’s been busting a gut, not insulting the crowd. And that’s drinks, when it could be the close – which must mean that NZ fancy some more bowling practice. England need 127 off 15 overs, but mainly they need to show some interest, as they did for a while towards the end of Root’s innings. “If it was 320 off 65, yes, I’d totally agree,” says Toby Sims, “buy Sibley a pint and drop anchor, but it wasn’t. I know England’s batting experience is at the low end, but I’d much rather see them just believing in the talent (it is there!), as 3.7 or whatever it was an over is a fair contest. If you’re set 500 and fighting for a draw, fair play, but NZ gave a damn good declaration – a ‘come on then if you think you’re hard enough’, and I think England should have taken it on. Australia aren’t as kind and it’s good experience...” Yes – the Aussies look like being the only winners here. 59th over: England 143-3 (Sibley 51, Pope 5) A single to each batsman off Southee. The end is nigh. “Watching today’s cricket,” says Jon Collins, “do you think England would be a better side if they’d made Eoin Morgan Test captain in 2017 instead of Joe Root? Too late now, obviously, but his captaincy – and the extra runs from Root – might have made it worth it?” Yes, they might well have done. And Morgan, with his Test average of 30, would not have been out of place in this team. 58th over: England 141-3 (Sibley 50, Pope 4) Wagner to Sibley, and it’s a maiden. For Sibley, you couldn’t call this a return to form, but it is a return to runs, following a sequence of 16, 16, 3, 0, 7, 2, 3 and 0. Those innings were more entertaining. 57th over: England 141-3 (Sibley 50, Pope 4) Southee returns and Sibley finally reaches his fifty, in true Sibley style – with an inside edge into the on-side. He has faced 161 balls, hit three fours, and lost a few thousand fans. Pope then shows him how it’s done with a fluent clip for four. 56th over: England 136-3 (Sibley 49, Pope 0) Root and Sibley had just collided – literally, in mid-pitch, as Root clipped for what should have been three. They ended up with two and Root managed a rueful smile, which was soon wiped away by the indefatigable Wagner. Ollie Pope comes in and starts with a play-and-miss. Another counter-view. “Honestly, the amount of knicker-wetting-pearl-clutching-fit-of-the-vapours outrage on here that England should dare to prioritise ‘not losing’ over ‘trying to snatch an unlikely victory’!” splutters Tom Adam. “‘Moral duty to chase’ forsooth! ‘Won’t someone think of the kiddies who came to watch’ indeed!” (Said no one, ever.) “What a load of absolute tosh. I can only assume that these are white-ball fans who’ve never watched Test cricket, have no idea of the fragility of England’s middle order, think targets are simply there to be knocked off in a flurry of cross-bat swipes and have no appreciation of the subtle joys of the slow grind to safety and the gradual crushing of the opposition’s hopes.” Yes, just pitching in line, and definitely hitting leg. Root departs, cursing loudly. Was he trying to win after all? It’s Wagner, it’s full and it’s plumb. unless he’s hit it. 55th over: England 133-2 (Sibley 49, Root 38) Santner is fit to bowl again, allegedly. Root greets his first ball with a big stride and a crisp sweep for four, and then does it again, well in front of square. And again, for a single this time, as there’s now a man in the deep. England have scored 53 off the past ten overs, which makes it all the more bizarre that they crawled along before that. “For the second time in two years,” says David Reynolds, “we are being schooled in sportsmanship by New Zealand at the home of cricket. Williamson was prepared to risk losing the match in order to win it, as any proper cricket captain at any level ought to be prepared to do. Root apparently lacks this most basic sporting and cricketing spirit. He ought to be ashamed.” 54th over: England 124-2 (Sibley 49, Root 29) Wagner comes back and concedes two no-balls, but no runs off the bat. The chase appears to be off again. We could do with a counter-opinion and here is one. “You’ll win nowt by slogging,” says Mike Shepherd. Are you sure? “In defence of England’s batting here, they’re just not very good batsmen (OK not a resounding riposte). They struggled to score 275 on a pitch with two days’ less wear in it, and no one on either side has been able to consistently score at the asking rate. If they’re trying to build this collection of callow, skittish-intent merchants into a batting line-up capable of winning away Tests, there will be some hard, dull days along the way. I appreciate it’s not great to watch, but I find it a lot less frustrating than (yet) another series of nick-offs and a press conference about taking the positives. “Also, I know it was a flippant point, but I think it’s a bit tasteless to compare Root’s captaincy (which I’m no fan of), to Robinson’s past bigotry.” Ah, I didn’t mean to suggest any resemblance between them, except that both deserve a ban, for different reasons. Also, I suspect we’ll still get the line about taking the positives. 53rd over: England 122-2 (Sibley 49, Root 29) Williamson continues with his so-called off-breaks, and both batsmen take some easy singles. England need 151 off 22 overs. Where’s Eoin Morgan when you need him? In the meantime, here’s Michael Keane. “Following my earlier contribution (12:09pm) about being turned away from Lord’s as I had turned up more 24 hours later than my ticket (which I’d misread) suggested, I am now feeling a calm sense of relief. As a plan B, I considered going to the pub with a cricket-sceptical friend to educate him about the supreme joys of the five-day game, but he was busy. Thank heavens.” 52nd over: England 118-2 (Sibley 47, Root 27) Santner carries on, sore finger and all, and Root helps himself to a cut for two, a sweep for two more, a better sweep for four, and a shovel for a single. He has rattled up 12 off his last six balls, having managed 15 off 54 before that. I don’t know what’s going off out there. 51st over: England 109-2 (Sibley 47, Root 18) Williamson brings himself on, perhaps in an effort to revive the match by giving away some cheap runs. Root edges a sweep for two, and brings up the fifty partnership – it’s now 53 from 123 balls. A worse fifty partnership you will seldom see. “This is unsportsmanlike behaviour,” says Alisdair Gould, “and should be punishable as such! The problem is the individual fear of consequences. Silverwood and Root should have made it clear – this innings no one will be found guilty, it will not count against you, it can count as an individual plus and a team plus though on the positive side. There is no question they morally had a duty to chase. Don’t waste my life, Sibley, any more.” 50th over: England 103-2 (Sibley 44, Root 15) Santner bowls a maiden, even though he seems to have a split finger. And England go back to square one. 49th over: England 103-2 (Sibley 44, Root 15) Sibley takes another single into the leg side off Jamieson, and Root plays a very Rootish glide for four to bring up the hundred. He even plays a pull, but only for a single. There’s still time, lads – if not to win, then at least to give it a go. “Embarrassing,” says Tim Robinson. “Both England’s game plan and Robinson’s teenage kicks, which are bad but should he be banned from playing cricket when someone else who made racist and sexist comments as an overpaid journalist has not been banned from running a country?” It’s a fair point. 48th over: England 97-2 (Sibley 43, Root 10) Sibley, facing Santner, plays another nurdle for another two. Santner then bowls a rank wide outside off which is mysteriously given as two byes. Sibley, unperturbed, nurdles for a single. Five off the over: that’s close to what they need. Are they tempted? Say it is so, Joe. “In answer to you and Dean Kinsella,” says Guy Hornsby, “this is all pretty unedifying. I understand why they’d want to not risk losing but this has been stultifying stuff, with no one really trying to look positive. Mere grim, soporific survival makes a mockery of Root’s claim.” 47th over: England 92-2 (Sibley 40, Root 10) Root takes the hint, glancing a yorker from Jamieson for four. And then he picks up a couple with a glide, to race into double figures. In theory, there are 28 overs left, and England need 181. They’re not suddenly going for it, are they? “I’m seriously worried,” says Peter Metcalfe, “that people might actually prefer watching The Hundred to watching this. Maybe it’s a cunning marketing ploy.” 46th over: England 86-2 (Sibley 40, Root 4) Sibley is thinking about being fully awake. He has a mow at Santner and gets four, along the ground, to long-on – ungainly but effective. And then he tucks for two. He has 20 off the last ten overs; Root has one. One!! “Have England got it right?” asks Toby Sims. “Absolutely not. I’m willing the Black Caps to smash them (as an England supporter) after a very sporting declaration and the chance of a good contest. Yes their attack is good, but I’ve seen zero application to a chase. Stokes and Buttler must be nauseous.” “England’s approach has been an admission of inadequacy,” says Tony Bennett. “They’re telling us they think Sibley, Crawley, Pope, Lawrence and Bracey are not up to it.” 45th over: England 80-2 (Sibley 34, Root 4) Sibley has half woken up, now that it’s too late: he glances de Grandhomme for a two and a single. That’s drinks, with England, I’m afraid, in disgrace. If Ollie Robinson gets a ban for his ancient tweets (and he should, alas), Joe Root should get one for this. It’s a crime against cricket. 44th over: England 77-2 (Sibley 31, Root 4) More excitement: three leg-byes, as Root tries to sweep Santner. In a perfect world, leg-byes would never have been invented – they’re a reward for missing the ball. On Twitter, Andy Zaltzman from TMS makes the same point as everyone else, with added stats. “This is a miserably timorous performance by England,” he says. “67-2 off 40 – their second lowest score after 40 overs in the last 20 years.” In the 1960s, the captain would have been sacked for it. Brian Close was. 43rd over: England 73-2 (Sibley 30, Root 4) Sibley goes crazy and takes a pair of twos off de Grandhomme – one nurdled to leg, the other mirroring it off a thick outside edge. The football is starting over on the other channel, and England’s captain is Marcus Rashford, so a dull day has a sporting highlight after all. 42nd over: England 69-2 (Sibley 26, Root 4) It’s a double change and on comes Mitchell Santner, who was picked for this match but not, as yet, backed by his captain. He’s had fewer overs than the man he’s now bowling to, Joe Root, even though the ball is turning. He gets one to fly off a length and concedes two byes as Root manages to keep his gloves out of the way. “I’m sorry,” says Dean Kinsella, “but England have not even given a nod towards an attempt to chase these runs down. For the first time in my 63 years I’m supporting the team playing against England.” Which makes me wonder: is there anyone reading this who reckons England have got it right? 41st over: England 67-2 (Sibley 26, Root 4) Colin de Grandhomme replaces Southee, which rather suggests that Kane Williamson has lost the will to win. The main excitement in this over is that BJ Watling sends for a helmet and comes up to the stumps, to stop Sibley standing outside his crease. And the consequence is ... a maiden. The partnership is 11 off 63 balls. 40th over: England 67-2 (Sibley 26, Root 4) Sibley goes on the attack! Driving Wagner down the ground for three, as if the past two hours had been a bad dream. Can we have a bit more of that, please? Jim on Twitter is back for more. “210 off 38 remaining overs is a perfectly respectable John Player League target,” he reckons. “Could still go for this, with Sibley set on 22. Oh. Sibley.” 39th over: England 64-2 (Sibley 23, Root 4) Southee to Sibley, and as the ball goes harmlessly past the bat the commentators are reduced to saying “what a good take”. When Sibley nurdles the last ball for a single, he gets some cheers, laced with sarcasm. “It seems peculiarly tactless,” says David Pearl, “to select the anniversary of D-Day to shut up shop, bore the spectators, insult the listeners, and scratch around for four hours when set an eminently achievable target.” 38th over: England 63-2 (Sibley 22, Root 4) Sibley has middled one! He goes back and punches to mid-off’s right to pick up another single. The partnership is now a princely 7 off 7.3 overs. We already knew that Root’s words about winning all seven Tests were less than wise (because you have to take each game as it comes, especially when you’ve just lost three in a row). Now he’s making us wonder if they were also less than honest. 37th over: England 62-2 (Sibley 21, Root 4) A single to each batsman off Southee, both off inswingers, both off the inside edge. Sam Billings runs on with some gloves and a message – the rest of the batsmen threatening to resign, I presume. 36th over: England 60-2 (Sibley 20, Root 3) A maiden from Wagner to Sibley. Gavaskar, infamously, made 36 off 60 overs; England have now managed the opposite, in very much the same spirit. “Killing time without injuring eternity,” says the subject line from David Gaskell. “Five an over is not impossible,” he then insists. “Ben the Flayer would get them single-handed whilst eating a Lords prawn cocktail with his free hand. On the bright side it does get one in the mood for England against Romania.” You can follow that game here if you’re fed up with this one. 35th over: England 60-2 (Sibley 20, Root 3) Southee’s turn to screech for an LBW, as Root takes a near-yorker on the base of the shin. The ump gives a run, when Nasser Hussain rightly points out that there was no nick, but it was going down anyway. “Seems like only a few days ago,” says Peter Salmon, “that England said they would try and win all seven Tests this summer.” Superb. 34th over: England 58-2 (Sibley 19, Root 2) Wagner thinks he’s got Sibley LBW with some swing back in, but the umpire reckons it’s too high, a view borne out by the fact that it thudded into Sibley’s box. I feel his pain, just as I’m hoping that he will feel mine, watching him bore for England. 33rd over: England 58-2 (Sibley 19, Root 2) Root gets off the mark first ball after tea, with a neat dab past third slip. That was more purposeful. The sun comes out, tentatively, like a shy kid who’s heard someone laughing in the next room. It’s going to be Tim Southee, the man most likely to move the game along. “Hey Jim on Twitter,” says Adam Roberts. “I’ll see your Brearley and Boycott and raise you a Gavaskar 1975 (36 years ago tomorrow).” Yes, stupendous stuff – though I make it 46. 32nd over: England 56-2 (Sibley 19, Root 0) Wagner runs back to his mark to try and squeeze in another over, but to no avail. And that’s tea, with the draw the hot favourite. The crowd will have more fun in the queue for a cuppa than they’ve had watching this session. In a perfect world, they would start singing “Are you a general anaesthetic in disguise?” “Give this another couple of hours,” says Geoffrey Smith, “and you’ll all be grateful for Sibley’s 54 not out at stumps.” Speak for yourself! “In addition to the sides’ aims (29th over),” says John Starbuck, “individual players are hoping to make their mark to survive the next week. Anyone from England whose name ends in a Y is at risk and getting desperate.” Ha. 31st over: England 56-2 (Sibley 19, Root 0) Now we have a contest: not just NZ v the draw, but Southee v Root. His opening ganbit is an inswinger, full length, which almost gets through Root’s defences as he shuffles across. That’s a wicket maiden and, for once, the dots don’t feel like a drag. Cometh the hour, cometh the Tim. Southee returns and instantly removes Crawley, playing the same loose drive that Sibley got away with a few minutes ago. Nicholls at gully takes the catch in front of his nose, and the New Zealanders have a sniff. 30th over: England 56-1 (Sibley 19, Crawley 2) Crawley gets a single off a leading edge, thanks to a misfield. Crap cricket all round! Please will someone take this game by the scruff of the neck. “Hell’s teeth,” says Jim on Twitter, “this is worse than watching Brearley and Boycott ‘chase’ the West Indies in the 1979 World Cup final. Smaller target, more overs, worse strike rate. Sitting at Lord’s almost hoping they’ll shake hands at 5.30 and put us all out of our misery.” 29th over: England 55-1 (Sibley 19, Crawley 1) Crawley shows his class for the first time with a flowing off drive, but a diving half-stop restricts him to a single. “I do declare,” says David Mel, promisingly, “that a series of unfortunate negatives – a day’s play lost to precipitation, dismal over rates, Burns being bashed on the head, precipitating two concussion breaks, poor England batting performance – have all conspired to showcase Test match appeal. From the embers (not Ashes) of despair and disappointment rises an enchanting and intriguing Red Ball cricket spectacle. Not harnessing Test Championship points gives Williamson a reason to chase for victory.” At the time of the declaration I’d have agreed with you, but the conspiracy is now between both sides, settling for a stalemate. 28th over: England 54-1 (Sibley 19, Crawley 0) We have a boundary! The first for an hour and a half, and it’s off the edge as Sibley chases a wide one from Wagner. If there’d been a third slip, it would have been a sitter. Wagner is trying to win this match, but I’m not sure that Williamson is. Michael Holding, meanwhile, has taken out his moral compass, applied it to the government’s Covid tests for people flying in, as he did the other day, and established that they are a scam. “Someone’s making a lot of money.” 27th over: England 50-1 (Sibley 15, Crawley 0) Sibley shovels Jamieson off his hip to bring up England’s fifty, which is greeted with ironic cheers – quite reasonably. Somewhere in Durham, Ben Stokes must be tearing his hair out. 26th over: England 49-1 (Sibley 14, Crawley 0) Wagner draws an inside edge from Crawley, which brings some oohs and aahs but no clink of timber. “Tim,” says Andrew Benton, “this is a battle pitting don’t-mess this-one-up-for-once England against batting-collapse-as-usual England. New Zealand are just a side order. Would be good if Bracey could get a reasonable score, he’s been rather in the shadows on his first England adventure.” Would be good if he could get a bat. I’m with you on the analysis of England’s mental state, but don’t we need to get away from taking New Zealand lightly? They’re a top team. 25th over: England 49-1 (Sibley 14, Crawley 0) Santner is taken off and Kyle Jamieson comes back. Williamson evidently wasn’t watching England in the winter when Crawley struggled to get going against slow left-armers – he likes the ball coming onto him. That’s a maiden from Jamieson: you can probably guess who was facing. 24th over: England 49-1 (Sibley 14, Crawley 0) Wagner, not for the first time, makes something happen. And in comes Crawley, on a pair, like about 36 per cent of England’s batsmen. “Gotta say that I agree with John Price (16th over),” says James Evans. “This was not a risky declaration from NZ. England’s lineup is inexperienced and under pressure, and the required run rate was higher than all three prior innings in the match. I think people are being swayed by Williamson-love. Had England been in this position, the narrative would be ‘could’ve declared half an hour earlier if we hadn’t scored so slowly yesterday’. (Not that I think NZ batted too slowly - England bowled very well and they couldn’t risk losing quick wickets.)” Wagner beats Burns outside off, then bowls the same ball, six inches to the left, and reaps his reward as Southee takes a crisp low catch at second slip. That’s good for New Zealand, and probably for England too. Burns goes off with a sore hand and 157 runs in the match. He had ten different partners and only looked in form when batting with the weakest of them, Jimmy Anderson. 23rd over: England 49-0 (Burns 25, Sibley 14) Sibley takes a run! Off Santner, with the tuck to square leg, which is Sibley’s signature stroke. Burns then gets in a tangle or two, and would be gone if Williamson had had a backward short leg. At this rate, if Zak Crawley ever comes in, he may well be greeted with a standing ovation. 22nd over: England 47-0 (Burns 24, Sibley 13) Southee takes a rare break as Neil Wagner comes on. He’s a man of two modes: one nasty, brutish and short, the other full and swinging. He goes full to Burns and finds that swing, but it’s from the hand so not hard to handle. That’s a maiden, so another bit of life drains from this contest. “I’ll see your exciting declaration,” says Adm Roberts, “and I’ll ... well, I’ll ignore it actually.” 21st over: England 47-0 (Burns 24, Sibley 13) Santner continues in his role as the only spinner in the village. And Sibley continues to block for England – he now has 13 from 59 balls. Joe Root may need to send someone out with a fresh pair of gloves and a note saying “Dom, don’t want to spoil your fun, but you do realise this is a run chase?”. Thanks Rob and afternoon everyone. This game was looking delicious when Kane Williamson declared, but Burns and Sibley have done their best to remove the flavour. Come on England, lose a wicket! 20th over: England 46-0 (Burns 23, Sibley 13) Another ball from Southee explodes at Burns, who gloves it fractionally short at Latham at second slip. That’s two vicious deliveries in as many overs, both of which could have dismissed Burns or broken his hand. On the subject of cricket charities, here’s Tom Levesley. “Cricket Without Boundaries does great work using cricket to work on issues like sexual health and promoting the game.” Right, I’m going to hand over to Tim for the rest of the day - you can email him on tim.delisle.casual@theguardian.com or tweet @TimdeLisle. Thanks for your company and emails throughout the game. Bye! 19th over: England 45-0 (Burns 22, Sibley 13) The left-arm spinner Mitchell Santner comes into the attack. He almost picks up a wicket with his first ball, a legside full toss that Burns lobs just short of mid-on. Had that gone to hand, it would have been the second most shambolic Test wicket on this ground: Rogers LBW b Swann in 2013 will never be beaten. “I love Kane’s aggressive declaration,” says Alistair Connor, “but bear in mind, NZ have two practice matches to work out how to win the World Test Championship in English conditions. If they lose one or both, they won’t give a toss (in fact, a toss in the final would be much more important to win).” 18th over: England 40-0 (Burns 21, Sibley 10) Burns is going to continue. That delivery from Southee, though not as extreme, brought to mind that famous delivery from David Saker back in the day. Meanwhile, Sibley survives a big LBW shout when he walks across his stumps to Southee. Williamson decides to review, though I’m pretty sure this is missing leg. Yep, it would only just have hit a fourth stump. 17.4 overs: England 35-0 (Burns 20, Sibley 10) Out of nothing, a delivery from Southee bursts from a fullish length to hit Burns on the glove. The ball lands safely on the off side, but there’s a break in play while Burns receives some treatment. That looked really nasty and he may struggle to grip the bat. 17th over: England 33-0 (Burns 20, Sibley 9) de Grandhomme has a huge shout for LBW against Sibley turned down by Richard Kettleborough. It looked too high, and Kane Williamson decides against a review. Another maiden from de Grandhomme, the seventh of the innings. It looks like the match is meandering to a draw. 16th over: England 33-0 (Burns 20, Sibley 9) Southee changes ends to replace Jamieson. He gets some prodigious inswing to Burns, who walks across and flicks to fine leg for four. In one game, he has jumped from third-choice opener to first choice. “Very little risk involved in the declaration,” says John Price. “Far too little experience in England’s batting line up to make a win a possibility. If Stokes, Woakes and Buttler had been playing, NZ might still be batting.” I know what you mean, though Crawley, Root, Pope and Lawrence in particular can score very quickly. I’d say it was riskier than most declarations. 15th over: England 29-0 (Burns 16, Sibley 9) Sibley plays a loose stroke and is beaten by de Grandhomme. A maiden. England are a fifth of the way to safety: 15 overs down, a maximum (realistically) of 60 to go. “Hiya Rob,” says Rob Little. “Re: the 13th over, does defleated = defeated + deflated? Excellent new verbiage if so.” You know you’re in trouble when typos are your best bits. 14th over: England 29-0 (Burns 16, Sibley 9) After all those maidens at the start of the innings, Jamieson is now going round the park. He concedes FIVE runs from his seventh over, which gives him figures of 7-5-6-0. “Well done to NZ for keeping this game alive and going for the win while risking a loss but I would add that this is the second time in 2021 that a team has adopted this tactic,” says Deepak. “I refer to the Gabba Test where India went for the win when a draw was all that was needed to retain the B-G Trophy. Test cricket is stronger as a result!” That’s true, although the circumstances were slightly different as India were batting last and Australia had more reason to take a risk with their declaration than New Zealand today. But I do agree that there is a new generation of players - hello Rishabh - who see opportunities rather than risks. 13th over: England 24-0 (Burns 15, Sibley 5) Burns softens his hands to steer de Grandhomme to the third-man boundary. New Zealand could use the impetus of a wicket; they’re starting to look a little defleated. 12th over: England 20-0 (Burns 11, Sibley 5) Jamieson spears an errant delivery past first slip for four byes. As with Robinson earlier in the day, I’m surprised that wasn’t called wide. With the batters looking more comfortable, Jamieson tries something different by moving round the wicket to Burns, and hits him high on the back leg with an excellent delivery. Burns tucks the last ball off the pads for a single, which ends Jamieson’s run of maidens. Instead he has the lamentable figures of 6-5-1-0. 11th over: England 15-0 (Burns 10, Sibley 5) Colin de Grandhomme replaces Southee, and Sibley survives a run-out referral from his first ball after being sent back by Burns. It was pretty tight, and he had to dive, but he made it. “It was Kane and NZ’s acceptance of the World Cup final result that saved the day from being poisoned and a now unpleasant memory,” says Jon Salisbury. “Certain other teams would still be in denial.” 10th over: England 14-0 (Burns 9, Sibley 5) After a torrid start, Sibley is starting to look more comfortable at the crease. He plays out another maiden from Jamieson without alarm. Jamieson has figures of 5-5-0-0, coincidentally my go-to formation for the big European away games on Championship Manager 01-02. “Afternoon Rob,” says Simon McMahon. “To return to the theme you started the Test with on Wednesday, New Zealand surely must be the most likeable team in world cricket, maybe even all sports. Their reaction to defeat in the World Cup final at Lord’s two years ago still to this day makes me proud to share the planet with people like them. I’m sure it will be no different whatever happens against India in the final of the World Test Championship. I think that’s enough patronising for one email?” It’s really bloomin’ hard not to unintentionally patronise them, isn’t it. 9th over: England 14-0 (Burns 9, Sibley 5) England’s path to an unlikely victory is probably to bat in a bubble until tea and then assess whether it’s worth risking defeat in an attempt to win. Surprisingly, the bookies have England at 8/1 and New Zealand at 7/1, with the draw 1/5. I think New Zealand have a much better chance than that, though the draw is favourite. “Dear Rob,” says Neil Clarke. “I wonder if you or your readers can suggest a cricket charity to commemorate the passing on Friday, of my good (and quirky) friend Pete N-H? The more unusual and niche, the better! He was an active and enthusiastic club cricketer until his recent illness along with being a committed Warwickshire fan.” I’m really sorry to hear that. I’m sure the readers will have a few ideas but the Lord’s Taverners is always a good option. 8th over: England 13-0 (Burns 9, Sibley 4) In New Zealand’s last Test on this ground, a classic in 2015, they were bowled out in 67.3 overs on the last day. Five of their XI played in that match, so they know it can be done, although they had already lost three wickets by this stage of their innings. Jamieson bowls his fourth consecutive maiden, though it wasn’t as good as the previous three - Burns was able to leave most of the deliveries. “A declaration with the word’s other meaning from NZ, a declaration of their sporting intent,” says Garry Sharp. “ I guess we are so used to Root dragging things out over the last few years (‘when will he declare?!’ ‘Why is he exposing his fast bowlers to injury with the bat when he should declare’, etc) that this approach to the game comes as a lovely surprise.” I’m not a great fan of Root’s captaincy but in his defence, most Test captains are pretty cautious when it comes to declarations. 7th over: England 13-0 (Burns 9, Sibley 4) Sibley drives Southee to mid-off and considers a Red Bull single before rightly deciding better of it. Southee beats him with a gorgeous outswinger, and then Sibley finally gets off the mark - and a pair - by working his 20th delivery to the square-leg boundary. Good shot. “I wonder if Kane Williamson actually realises what a top guy he is,” says Brian Withington. “I’m still amazed at how graciously he accepted the World Cup final ‘defeat’.” I suppose if he realised he was a top guy, he wouldn’t be one. 6th over: England 9-0 (Burns 9, Sibley 0) Jamieson has Burns in his sights for the first time, and beats him with a beauty. It’s another maiden, the third in a row for Jamieson. If it doesn’t rain, England could have a job on to save this match. “Well done to Kane Williamson for giving England the chance to win, or lose!” says Jim Hornby. “In my opinion draws are a stain on the sport of cricket, and something English mentality particularly suffers from. Better to draw than to lose? Too often that means taking away any risk or excitement. To win should mean that either the batting or bowling side excels in their role. To draw should be a consequence of both excelling equally, not as a planned outcome for fear of losing.” You are the great-grandson of Keith Miller and I claim my five pounds. 5th over: England 9-0 (Burns 9, Sibley 0) That ball from Jamieson actually hit Sibley just below the elbow, not on the glove. That really is nobody’s idea of a good time, especially when the bowler is 6ft 8ins. Sibley is fine to continue, though not yet to get off a pair. He has 0 from 15 balls. 4th over: England 8-0 (Burns 8, Sibley 0) Sibley, still on a pair, skims a drive along the floor to gully. Jamieson is probing relentlessly outside off stump and beats Sibley with a lovely delivery that bursts off the seam. The last ball of a majestic over goes the other way and raps Sibley on the glove. 3rd over: England 8-0 (Burns 8, Sibley 0) Southee moves round the wicket to Burns, with two slips and two men in the gully. Burns gets his second boundary with a sweetly timed push-drive through mid-on. “Afternoon Rob,” says Theo. “All four results eh? Someone’s gunning for a tie. I was thinking how close we’ve come to someone carrying the bat in this game, not once but twice. Has it ever happened multiple times in a game? And will it be Dom or Rory who takes us through today?” I’m pretty sure it has happened in first-class cricket, but not in an international game. 2nd over: England 4-0 (Burns 4, Sibley 0) A nervous moment for Dom Sibley, who is on a pair and edges Kyle Jamieson on the bounce to first slip. His hands were soft enough to ensure it didn’t carry. It’s an excellent first over from Jamieson, with every delivery challenging Sibley’s judgement of whether to play or leave. “Love the declaration,” says Neill Brown. “I wonder how much Williamson was influenced by Stokes’ absence? I suppose Ollie Robinson could play the Stokes role and become a national hero in the process?” Not just Stokes but Buttler too. It’s an awkward pitch and I’ll be surprised if England get anywhere near the target. 1st over: England 4-0 (Burns 4, Sibley 0) Immediate swing for Southee, which is just what New Zealand wanted, and Burns has a moment of fortune when a leading edge flies along the ground for four. I don’t know about you, but I feel energised by that declaration. All four results are back on, with a New Zealand win looking much more likely than it did this morning. Blimey, I didn’t expect this. It’s an adventurous decision from Kane Williamson, and means England need 273 in 75 overs. It’s on! So, what do we think for the declaration? Five more overs at run a ball would allow them to set a target of 306 in 68 overs, which should give them immunity against defeat. Play will resume at 1.26pm, it says here. 52.3 overs: New Zealand 169-6 (Watling 15, de Grandhomme 9) de Grandhomme pulls Anderson up and over for four. With New Zealand in one-day mode, I’m surprised England aren’t using their only white-ball bowler, Mark Wood. Not that it matters for now because the rain is getting heavier and the umpires have decided to take an early lunch. New Zealand have a handy lead of 272, and there are a maximum of 75.3 overs remaining (minus two for the change of innings). They could still win this. 52nd over: New Zealand 162-6 (Watling 15, de Grandhomme 2) The new batter Colin de Grandhomme gets off a pair by whapping a full toss for a single. New Zealand lead by 265. “Good morning Rob,” says Adam Roberts. “Your mention of Stuart B on Courtney Walsh’s knee immediately put me in mind of one of my favourite photos. My very young daughter, all golden curls and cherubic features, sitting on Michael Holding’s knee - completely oblivious to who he is - attacking him with a giant foam finger. “Which ties in nicely with today. Unexpectedly awake from 4am. I made the most of it by switching on the cricket at 5. First up is the mellifluous voice of Mikey H, explaining his late arrival at the Test because of the problems of getting out of Cayman to the UK (he had to fly through the States) - something my family is currently struggling with.” Henry Nicholls walks. He missed a reverse sweep at Root and gloved the ball into the off side, where Burns ran forward from slip and swooped to take a fine low catch. 51st over: New Zealand 159-5 (Nicholls 23, Watling 14) Some light rain is falling at Lord’s. Play continues for now, though the umpires could decide to take an early lunch. “Is it just me,” says Mark Steward, “or does Ollie Robinson look like the secret lovechild of Freddie Flintoff and Steve Harmison?” He reminds me more of Harmison when he bats, though he’s obviously more accomplished. I suppose there are many worse lovechildren to resemble. 50th over: New Zealand 157-5 (Nicholls 22, Watling 13) Root hurries through another over, and why not. 49th over: New Zealand 156-5 (Nicholls 22, Watling 12) Watling edges Anderson for four, which takes New Zealand’s lead to 259. There are still a maximum of 79 overs remaining; I’d imagine they will given England a target of around 310 in 67 overs. 48th over: New Zealand 151-5 (Nicholls 22, Watling 7) Root continues. Nicholls swipes him over mid-on for four and then misses a huge slog-sweep. Had he connected with that, no outdoor brunch on St John’s Wood High Street would have been safe. New Zealand lead by 254, and I’m starting to wonder whether England are sleepwalking into a horror movie. 47th over: New Zealand 144-5 (Nicholls 16, Watling 6) Or maybe Root came on so that Anderson can change ends, which is what he has just done. One from the over. “Finding the endless moaning about over rates on telly and radio increasingly irritating,” says Andy Moore. “Why can’t we just accept that in the modern game bowling 15 overs per hour isn’t feasible (what with reviews, drinks breaks etc)? Is there any other sport that places more importance in the time of day than the amount of play to be completed? Looking forward to the Ryder Cup concluding at 6pm sharp with America 1/2 point ahead and Justin Rose 4 up with 5 to play. Really grinds my gears.” I can see both sides of this argument. I find it hard to angry about slow over-rates, but then I haven’t paid however much to get into the ground. Your point is a good one, that there are more natural interruptions nowadays, concussion checks and the like, but equally 12 overs an hour is pushing it. Maybe 14 per hour is a more realistic target, I don’t know. 46th over: New Zealand 142-5 (Nicholls 15, Watling 5) Joe Root replaces Anderson, perhaps with England’s inadequate over-rate in mind. Five from the over. “In cryptic crossword circles, the process which you just have described about de Stael (ie divining the existence of something highbrow from something distinctly lowbrow) is known as ‘Ninja Turtling’,” says Tom Adam. “It stems from, ‘Of course I’ve heard of Donatello. He’s the one with the purple mask.’” That’s a good phrase, I hadn’t heard of that. Also, David Chase would like to discuss your description of the Sopranos as ‘distinctly lowbrow’. It’s okay, he’s in a good mood. 45th over: New Zealand 137-5 (Nicholls 11, Watling 4) I thought they might promote Colin de Grandhomme for some bish-bosh, but BJ Watling is the new batter, and he gets going with an emphatic cut for four. That was a useful cameo from Taylor: 33 from 35 balls with one four, two sixes and a comprehensive range of fresh-air shots. “Kudos to Michael Keane for not venting spleen on anyone else (the pandemic aside) for his mis-ticketing episode,” says Ian Copestake. “I wish him a very tasty lunch.” I hope it’s not egg and bacon. Ross Taylor’s eccentric innings comes to an end. He chases a deliberately wide delivery from Wood and snicks it through to Bracey, who takes a nice low catch to his right. 44th over: New Zealand 132-4 (Taylor 33, Nicholls 10) Jimmy Anderson comes on for Stuart Broad, and Taylor survives a very good-looking LBW shout. The umpire Michael Gough thought there was an inside edge, but the two noises were actually the ball hitting both pads. England have wasted all three of their reviews; had they been able to go upstairs, Taylor would have been out. “Just re-emerging from your Cricinfo link/wormhole in the 34th over,” says Jim Crane. “That 1989 Australia tour itinerary - madon! Six Tests, visits to all the counties, and then casually rounding it off with two bilateral series against Netherlands and Denmark! Imagine rocking up to an ICC board meeting in 2021 with that proposal.” It’s great isn’t it. They played a county game the day after they regained the Ashes, and the stand-in captain Geoff Marsh chose to bat first on a green mamba because, in his words, “the boys are all still pissed”. 43rd over: New Zealand 126-4 (Taylor 30, Nicholls 7) An extraordinary shot from Ross Taylor, who slogs across the line at Wood and top edges the ball high over third man for six. Taylor is so dangerous that, despite middling almost nothing, he has raced to 30 from 31 balls. “Morning Rob,” says Michael Keane. “I’m heading home from Lord’s where, on arrival at the Grace Gate, it transpired that my ticket was for yesterday. Woe is me. As a newly minted member I had thought my days of ticket tragedies were over. But for now even those of us bedecked in egg and bacon need to book a seat. Bloody global pandemic... Looks like it’s the OBO and TMS for me today then. Maybe I’ll make lunch for my better half or something. Feck.” This is mildly heartbreaking, and extremely funny. (I say that as the kind of airhead who does things like this all the time.) 42nd over: New Zealand 118-4 (Taylor 23, Nicholls 6) Nicholls goes into one-day mode, walking down the pitch to slice Broad high over the slips for four. Broad replies with another big inswinger - too big, this time, as it veers away for four leg byes. New Zealand have scored 56 from 12 overs this morning; they lead by 221. “If Friedrich Nietzsche was on comms,” says Ian Copestake, his eyebrows unintentionally betraying the extent of that if, “Zak Crawley’s cover drive would be a cue for his line that, ‘Art is the supreme task and the truly metaphysical activity in this life.’” 41st over: New Zealand 109-4 (Taylor 23, Nicholls 1) Mark Wood replaces Ollie Robinson (14-5-26-3) and beats Taylor with the first and last deliveries of the over. Two runs from it. “The 2000 Code of the Laws of Cricket was the first to use ‘fielder’, instead of ‘fieldsman’,” says Alan Tuffery. That’s interesting; I expected it to be much earlier than that. 40th over: New Zealand 107-4 (Taylor 22, Nicholls 1) That’s Broad’s 518th Test wicket, which puts him one behind Courtney Walsh, the man whose lap Broad used to sit on when he was a kid. Imagine the eight-year-old Broad’s face if you told him they would both end up with 500 Test wickets. After a mildly scandalous amount of misfortune, Stuart Broad finally gets his first wicket of the match in his 38th over. Latham, beaten the ball before, is hit on the back leg by a big inswinger bowled from wider on the crease. Michael Gough gives it out and, though Latham reviews, it’s hitting enough of leg stump for the original decision to stand. 39th over: New Zealand 106-3 (Latham 36, Taylor 22) Taylor misses another disgusting mow across the line at Robinson. But then he finally nails the shot, pinging Robinson over midwicket for a huge six. He is always dangerous, even when his bat seems to have no middle. “Hi Rob,” says Pete Salmon. “Who remembers The Professionals? We’ve been watching Bodie and Doyle at ours as our lockdown treat – just started the final series and already mourning getting to the end. Two very nice moments for OBOers recently. One, Bodie playing club cricket, moving rapidly through the nineties with a series of pull shots, and then getting bowled for 97 after being distracted by a call to duty (followed by getting changed out of his whites in the back of a speeding car, as we’ve all done at some stage). And then in last night’s episode, Doyle having to pretend he’s an intellectual. Bodie: ‘Can you keep the patter up?’ Doyle: ‘Of course, I read the Guardian.’” I’m now desperate to know what Arthur Daley made of our esteemed rag. 38th over: New Zealand 97-3 (Latham 35, Taylor 14) “Excellent Guardianista preamble reference to the French-Swiss Anne Louise Germaine de Staël-Holstein,” says Brian Withington. “She almost invented the Guardian strap line with the phrase ‘Search for the truth is the noblest occupation of man; its publication is a duty’. Apparently she is also quoted as saying, ‘The more I see of man, the more I like dogs’, so something for [redacted] readers, too.” While I’d love to flaunt my education, and perhaps explore what Nietzsche’s philosophy can tell us about Zak Crawley’s cover drive, I only know the Madade de Staël quote because Meadow mentions it in the Sopranos. 37th over: New Zealand 93-3 (Latham 34, Taylor 11) Taylor doesn’t look remotely comfortable against Robinson. He is beaten outside off stump, edges short of the slips and then hacks desperately across the line for a couple of runs. Robinson smiles at Taylor with contempt and then has a big LBW appeal turned down when Taylor misses another smear. England was their last review - it hit him miles outside off stump. That wasn’t great captaincy from Joe Root. But it was a brilliant over from Robinson, which concludes with another play and miss by Taylor 36th over: New Zealand 91-3 (Latham 34, Taylor 8) “The last day of the match will not be so drab if Ross Taylor and Colin de Grandhomme can come in and smash Anderson and co. to make a hundred-odd runs in 90 minutes,” writes Gangesh. “Chasing 300-plus in 70 overs will enthuse England, and their aggression could provide the Kiwi bowlers opportunities. So that’s a possibility Kane Williamson can explore to inject some interest in the game - provided, of course, the notorious English weather stays fine!” A repeat of the last day in 2015 would be all kinds of fun. 35th over: New Zealand 87-3 (Latham 33, Taylor 6) England would love to get Taylor early as he is somebody who can score quickly, as he shows with a cracking extra cover drive for four later. Robinson pulls his length back as a result and rips one past the edge. Lovely response. “Has anyone seen a split screen of Ollie Robinson and Josh Hazlewood bowling?” says Gary Naylor. “The more I see of the Sussex bruiser, the more I think of the Australian err... bruiser.” Hazlewood’s a bit quicker, isn’t he? But otherwise it’s an excellent comparison – forensic accuracy, sharp bounce, seam movement and a hint of malevolence. 34th over: New Zealand 81-3 (Latham 32, Taylor 1) There’s an urgency to New Zealand’s batting that wasn’t evident last night, so perhaps my assumption of a draw was premature. I can think of one precedent in particular. But it’s really not easy to score quickly on this pitch. Broad beats Latham with a stunning delivery and then has him dropped by Crawley at midwicket, a sharp two-handed chance to his right. Broad has had no luck at all in this game. “I can live with batter,” says Adrian Goldman. “What I can’t live with is that in science, sulfate is now the expected spelling, not sulphate. Beyond dismay: pretty much the end of civilisation as we know it.” I’ll see your sulfate and raise you T20 scorecards that have dot balls instead of maidens. It’s cultural vandalism. What the hell is 2-4-12-1 supposed to mean? 33rd over: New Zealand 80-3 (Latham 32, Taylor 0) In the history of Test cricket there have been 3,054 debuts, but none quite look Ollie Robinson’s: 42 runs, seven cheap wickets and a public shaming. He loses his line at the end of the over, spearing a delivery down the leg side for four byes. James Bracey was pretty gutted that it wasn’t called a wide. A third wicket for Ollie Robinson. Wagner, roughed up by a couple of good short balls, top-edged a hook miles in the air and was calmly caught by James Bracey. 32nd over: New Zealand 72-2 (Latham 31, Wagner 10) Stuart Broad gets a chance to bowl at Neil Wagner, who dismissed him yesterday and celebrated with a red-faced flourish. Broad appeals for LBW first ball, but it was going down on the angle. Wagner then cracks two boundaries, a flash up and over the cordon and a majestic flick through midwicket. I’d love to hear Broad’s internal monologue right now. “This fuss comes up regularly,” says John Starbuck. “’Batter’ is, agreed, both an Americanism (by way of the English invention of baseball) and a flour, milk and egg mixture. But think what might happen if we used ‘bowlsman’ as a standard. If we can do it with one essential element of cricket, we can do it with the other. Besides, look at the ambiguities of ‘pitch’ and ‘wicket’, which vary a lot depending on context. Language is meant to be fluid.” Test Match Special overseas link Here you are. 31st over: New Zealand 62-2 (Latham 30, Wagner 2) Ollie Robinson will open the bowling, a reward for his forensic excellence last night. He switches over and round the wicket to Latham, giving him precisely no opportunities to score. Thus, it’s a maiden. “The OED has instances ‘batter’ being used in relation to cricket going back about 200 years, so it’s not like it’s without precedent,” says Andrew Cosgrove. “Also, you don’t talk about a ‘bowlsman’ do you? Anyway, do you think England are capable of batting out two sessions for a draw?” I do, I do. A collapse wouldn’t shock me but I think it’s unlikely, especially as there are likely to be one of two rain interruptions. This is a majestic piece from Andy Bull, with a particularly brilliant intro. “I am becoming more &amp; more dismayed by the use of the term ‘batter’ in cricket,” says Ben Carter. “All the commentators are doing it. The term is BATSMAN. Are you all coordinated by someone who tells you what to say?” Yes, last month Mother Cricket gave her 475 children a collective brollocking for our sexist terminology. Seriously, though, with everything else that’s going on in the world right now, is a change of language designed to increase inclusivity really worthy of dismay? I can understand thinking it’s a bit heavy-handed, not that I’d necessarily agree, but dismay, I can’t have that. The draws are back in town. Today, all things being equal, England will draw their third consecutive Test at home for the first time since the late eighties. And though that’s mainly down to the weather, it also reflects a different approach and a greater resilience under Chris Silverwood. The Bayliss-era England might have thrown the towel in when they slipped to 140 for six; instead, Rory Burns and Ollie Robinson (with bat and ball) stalled New Zealand’s momentum to such an extent that they finished the day crawling along at two an over. New Zealand will resume on 62 for two, a lead of 165. With a maximum of 98 overs to bowl, they could still force victory on a pitch is becoming more uneven. But with a forecast for showers – of the meteorological rather than the middle-order kind – that looks unlikely. Madame de Stael said that one must choose in life between boredom and suffering. England politely request a boring last day.","charCount":"59301","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/timdelisle\">Tim de Lisle</a> (now) and <a href=\"profile/robsmyth\">Rob Smyth</a> (earlier)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"stage/2021/jun/07/hamilton-musical-melbourne-2022-season-tickets-sydney-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-06T20:00:48Z","webTitle":"Smash-hit musical Hamilton confirms Melbourne season: ‘Mask up and we’ll be there’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/jun/07/hamilton-musical-melbourne-2022-season-tickets-sydney-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2021/jun/07/hamilton-musical-melbourne-2022-season-tickets-sydney-australia","fields":{"headline":"Smash-hit musical Hamilton confirms Melbourne season: ‘Mask up and we’ll be there’","standfirst":"<p>The Sydney production is the only one playing anywhere in the world but the Victoria season will start in March 2022, with tickets on sale in July</p>","trailText":"The Sydney production is the only one playing anywhere in the world but the Victoria season will start in March 2022, with tickets on sale in July","byline":"Elissa Blake","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"81d414e95ce4e72e61603d1ab7c4d2ee68720b5c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81d414e95ce4e72e61603d1ab7c4d2ee68720b5c/94_112_1837_1103/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jason Arrow, who stars as Alexander Hamilton, said the show has ‘grown a lot’ since premiering in Sydney.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hamilton is heading to Melbourne and tickets are on sale in July.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Boud</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>The Australian production of Lin Manuel Miranda’s hit musical Hamilton has finally announced its long-rumoured Melbourne season, which will commence at Melbourne’s 1,700-seat Her Majesty’s theatre from 16 March 2022 – after the record-breaking Sydney run finishes at the Lyric theatre on 19 December.</p> <p>The Melbourne season was to have been announced in late May but producers the Michael Cassel Group delayed the news following Melbourne’s coronavirus outbreak and subsequent lockdown.

Guardian analysis of trade data can reveal that each year nearly 11m tonnes of fuel and oil (the equivalent of 1100 Eiffel towers) are extracted from the region, 2m tonnes of copper, nickel, manganese and aluminium are mined, and gold worth US$2.6bn is quarried. But despite the minerals and wealth pulled from the Pacific’s mountains, valleys, oceans and rivers, communities often have little to show for it. In Solomon Islands, a bauxite mine on Rennell Island has scarred a once-pristine landscape and been the cause of environmental disasters – spills of oil and bauxite into the island’s fishing grounds – while paying zero royalties to the government. Nauru once had one of the highest per capita incomes in the world because of a booming phosphate mining industry in the 1970s and 80s. But the mismanagement of hundreds of millions in royalties caused the near-collapse of the country’s economy and fuelled a series of financial crises. Nearly 80% of the island’s small landmass is unliveable, having been stripmined by foreign multinationals. On Kiribati’s Banaba, mining has left the atoll with no reliable supply of drinking water. And, in New Caledonia, angst over nickel mining has undermined political stability. But nowhere is the impact of mining – its booms and busts, potentials and pitfalls – felt more acutely than across Papua New Guinea’s broad archipelago. A wicked dilemma On the island of Bougainville, which for now remains part of PNG but in 2019 voted overwhelmingly for independence, sits Panguna – the gold and copper mine which once brought billions to its foreign owners. The giant hulk of Panguna, all but silent now for 32 years, is representative of the wicked dilemma faced by PNG in its relationship with mining: its resources are both blessing and curse. On one hand, resource extraction has poured millions into government coffers, funding development and government services, and enabling a fragile post-independence economy to grow. Panguna bankrolled PNG in its early post-independence years. Over 17 years it made more than US$2bn for the mine’s former owner and operator, Rio Tinto, which pulled 550,000 tonnes of copper concentrate and 450,000 ounces of gold from the mine in its last year alone. At one point, Panguna accounted for 45% of all of PNG’s exports and 12% of its GDP. By weight, oil, metals and minerals represent 61% of the country’s total exports. But the majority of the wealth generated by the vast natural resources does not flow to the people of the country but runs offshore. In monetary terms, oil and mining accounted for approximately 90% of PNG exports in 2018 but just 10% of government revenues. On top of this, many mines, such as the Lihir goldmine exploiting tax exemptions and accounting practices like accelerated depreciation, have paid almost zero corporate tax since 2013. In the case of Panguna, the mine brought but a sliver of the wealth and development that was promised to those whose land it was on – less than 1% of profits. It left behind a legacy of division, violence and environmental degradation. Rio Tinto abandoned Panguna in 1989. It has never returned, saying it is unsafe for its staff, despite pleas from landowners to repair the vast and ongoing environmental damage. The director of PNG’s Institute of National Affairs, Paul Barker, says it is a constant challenge for resource-rich developing nations to balance the economic benefit of extraction against the wellbeing of their peoples. “We all use the products from extractive industries, but it is society’s responsibility – including government and the mining industry’s – to manage that process to minimise the negative impact, to lay down and apply minimum standards… and to mark some places as off-limits for extractive industries,” he says Barker says PNG “has made many mistakes along the way”, in not keeping the profits and benefits of mining within the country, to be used for the advantage of the PNG people, and allowing too much of the wealth generated by its natural resources to go offshore. “It learned a lot of lessons from mistakes, like the need for effective landowner consultation … but then forgot those lessons in some cases, and pushed through some projects through arrangements that lacked transparency, creating avenues for future discontent.” ‘We cannot access clean drinking water’ At the other end of PNG, the story is starkly familiar.

In 2020 the PNG government cancelled the mining lease of a part-Chinese owned Porgera gold mine in Enga, claiming that the country was not getting its fair share of its profits. But still more mines are proposed: in Lae, PNG’s first coalmine and coal-fired power plant is proposed, while in Sepik province, at the head of the Sepik and Frieda rivers, plans for the country’s largest copper and gold mine have been advanced, over the vociferous protests of village councils and the concerns of the UN special rapporteur, who says the planned mine carries a risk of “catastrophic ... loss of life and environmental destruction [and] appears to disregard the human rights of those affected”.","charCount":"7100","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/lyanne-togiba\">Lyanne Togiba</a> in Port Moresby and <a href=\"profile/ben-doherty\">Ben Doherty</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2021/jun/07/the-little-island-that-won-how-a-tiny-pacific-community-fought-off-a-giant-mining-company","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-06T20:00:48Z","webTitle":"The little island that won: how a tiny Pacific community fought off a giant mining company","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/07/the-little-island-that-won-how-a-tiny-pacific-community-fought-off-a-giant-mining-company","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/jun/07/the-little-island-that-won-how-a-tiny-pacific-community-fought-off-a-giant-mining-company","fields":{"headline":"The little island that won: how a tiny Pacific community fought off a giant mining company","standfirst":"<p>A proposal to mine 60% of Wagina for bauxite was met with outrage by locals and became a landmark case in Solomon Islands</p><ul><li>Read more of our Pacific Plunder series <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/pacific-plunder\">here</a></li></ul>","trailText":"A proposal to mine 60% of Wagina for bauxite was met with outrage by locals and became a landmark case in Solomon Islands","byline":"Dorothy Wickham in Wagina, and Ben Doherty","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ac3456fba572678ab586748ce404f4df935bc70c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac3456fba572678ab586748ce404f4df935bc70c/120_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wagina Island from the air\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wagina from the air.

Those on Wagina – a small island in Solomon Islands, home to roughly 2,000 people, 1,700km north-west of Cairns – fought hard to keep the mining company away because the memory of forced displacement is not a distant tale handed down through generations, but a living memory. Wagina’s people have been displaced twice already. In the 1930s they were forced from their ancestral home in the Southern Gilbert Islands (now part of Kiribati), because of land shortages and overpopulation, to a new island chain, the Phoenix Islands. In the early 1960s the British forcibly uprooted them again, ostensibly because of persistent droughts, but the community believe the relocation was related to British nuclear testing in neighbouring atolls. That time the families were moved more than 3,000km across the Pacific, to Wagina where they began a new life among Melanesian neighbours who looked and spoke, ate and farmed, celebrated and mourned, differently to the ways they had known back home. Moving was an upheaval some could not face a second time. “One old man committed suicide before we left our home because he was not happy about leaving things behind like the coconut trees he planted,” says one villager, Tetoaiti Amon. But the people of Wagina have made their new island their home, building kastom and community links and a new industry: they are now the largest farmers of seaweed – for toothpaste, food, cosmetics and fertiliser – in the Pacific. Then, in 2013, Solomon Bauxite Limited – a mining company owned by two Hong Kong-listed companies – was granted a permit for an open-cast mine on Wagina. Publicly available plans show that the mine would have affected 48 sq km – 60% – of the island, and involved clearing 2,000 hectares of virgin forest. An airport would have been built (the island is now accessible only by boat), along with new roads, significant excavation and the movement of roughly 150 truckloads of bauxite every day for 20 years. The business case was strong. The island is rich in the key ore for making aluminium, which is used in construction, cars, aircraft and consumer electronics. And Solomon Islands is close – 10 days by sea – to China, the world’s largest bauxite importer. The mine was forecast to produce between 24bn and 40bn kg of ore over two decades, working 16 hours a day, six days a week. But the islanders fought the case in a bruising, burdensome court struggle that ran for four years and, in 2018, were granted a stay on mining until the proposal was further scrutinised. In March 2019 the islanders’ victory was strengthened when, in its first decision, Solomon Islands’ environmental advisory committee overturned the mining licence, finding that residents had not been properly consulted and the company’s environmental impact statement was “rather unscientific and improper” and not legally valid. “A mine tenement covering 60% of a small island will have tremendous environmental impacts on water quality, air quality, the ecology and the marine environment,” the committee said in its decision. “It will also have a dramatic and likely irreversible impact on the more than 2,000 residents of the island who rely on the sea and land for their livelihood … What will become of the people of Wagina if the mining occupies such a significant area of Wagina Island? Where will they obtain their material to construct their homes and resources to support their livelihoods?” That decision was appealed but last November the environment minister upheld the decision. But the fight is not finished yet. The mining proposal has been widely, though not universally, opposed on Wagina, creating fissures within a small community built on consensus. This year a group of eight villagers – calling themselves the Maungatabu, or “council of elders” – reportedly signed a memorandum of understanding with Solomon Bauxite for mining to proceed. William Kadi, vice-president of the Solomon Islands Environmental Law Association, has steered the people of Wagina’s legal battle. He says while the MOU has no legal standing and is fiercely contested on the island, residents still live with the threat that miners might return to their home. “The saddest part is not having the sense of owning the land where you live,” he says. “It’s just unbelievable that these people have been here for decades and still they could not have new parcels of land in the Island granted for them to cater for a growing population and their needs, while a mining company can just easily sign off a lease for three-quarters of the island, it’s just absurd.” The Guardian put questions about the proposed mine to Solomon Bauxite Limited but did not receive a response. In response to an Amnesty International investigation, a company director, Bruce Hills, wrote: “The Wagina bauxite project represents a significant financial and development opportunity for Solomon Islands.” “The directors … believe that it is critical that Solomon Islands be in a position to attract mining companies that have the genuine skills and willingness to develop the mining industry in an environmentally and socially sustainable manner. “We believe this project is too valuable for all stakeholders for it not to be developed.” But a Wagina elder, Tebukewa Mereki, who led the appeal to the environmental advisory committee, has spent years patiently arguing before courts and tribunals that the right of the people of Wagina to live peacefully on their island outweighs any promised economic or development benefits. “Wagina is our life,” he said in his legal challenge. “If they destroy Wagina, we have nowhere else to go.”","charCount":"6281","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"Dorothy Wickham in Wagina, and <a href=\"profile/ben-doherty\">Ben Doherty</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2021/jun/06/baftas-2021-michaela-coel-dedicates-win-to-intimacy-coordinator","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-06T20:00:47Z","webTitle":"Baftas 2021: Michaela Coel dedicates win to intimacy coordinator","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/jun/06/baftas-2021-michaela-coel-dedicates-win-to-intimacy-coordinator","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2021/jun/06/baftas-2021-michaela-coel-dedicates-win-to-intimacy-coordinator","fields":{"headline":"Baftas 2021: Michaela Coel dedicates win to intimacy coordinator","standfirst":"<p>Coel picks up acting award as her hit drama I May Destroy You, which deals with sexual assault, wins best mini-series <br></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/jun/06/baftas-2021-tv-awards-winners-full-list\">The full list of winners</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/gallery/2021/jun/06/baftas-red-carpet-2021-michaela-coel-to-jodie-comer-in-pictures\"></a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/jun/06/baftas-2021-tv-awards-winners-full-list\"> </a><br></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/gallery/2021/jun/06/baftas-red-carpet-2021-michaela-coel-to-jodie-comer-in-pictures\">Bafta TV awards red carpet – in pictures</a></li></ul>","trailText":"Coel picks up acting award as her hit drama I May Destroy You, which deals with sexual assault, wins best mini-series ","byline":"Mark Brown Arts correspondent","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"341a285593403bebf952c25f2db4113e0cb487ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/341a285593403bebf952c25f2db4113e0cb487ee/0_448_3437_2061/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michaela Coel with her award\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michaela Coel said sets needed intimacy experts and not having them showed ‘a lack of mindfulness’. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David M Benett/Dave Benett/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jul/12/michaela-coel-profile-i-may-destroy-you-trauma-into-cultural-triumph\">Michaela Coel</a> and her hit drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jun/08/i-may-destroy-you-review-michaela-coel-could-this-be-the-best-drama-of-the-year\">I May Destroy You</a> won big at the 2021 television Baftas on Sunday – with Coel dedicating her acting award to the series’ intimacy coordinator.</p> <p>Accepting awards for a show that dealt with sexual abuse and consent, Coel said film and television sets were vulnerable places for actors and crew members.

As we say, 100 per cent of facilities across those four states and territories completed as we say on Friday, and 99 per cent across the country.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-06-01T04:27:37.781Z\">at 5.27am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-60b5b3fe8f088d8c3178f21c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-01T04:14:49.736Z\">5.14am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The current deputy prime minister is on his feet, doing his best to once again demonstrate the difference between meritocracy and mediocrity and why they are so often confused.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-06-01T04:17:23.911Z\">at 5.17am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-60b5b34e8f086d71cc160a38\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-01T04:13:22.512Z\">5.13am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Greg Hunt</strong> admits in question time he misread the department advice when he said just six aged care facilities hadn‚Äôt been visited for their first dose ‚Äì the department told estimates today, it was 21 sites, as of yesterday.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I did make an error yesterday.

Victoria‚Äôs Covid outbreak has shown the vulnerabilities in the federally funded and regulated aged care homes once again: while staff in state-run facilities cannot work at other sites, staff at private facilities ‚Äì which are under the federal government‚Äôs jurisdiction ‚Äì are still able to. </p> \n  <p>That‚Äôs become an issue in this outbreak ‚Äì again ‚Äì after a staff member caught Covid from a colleague at one centre and then worked at another centre. </p> \n  <p>So far the federal government have been unable to give a reason for it, other than there are not enough staff. <strong>Greg Hunt </strong>said yesterday the states could stop it through a public health order, but that would mean workers ‚Äì who are working multiple sites to make a liveable wage ‚Äì would be forced to lose pay. Policy and pay settings have changed in the state-run facilities. That hasn‚Äôt happened federally, despite the recommendations of the royal commission. </p> \n  <p>We‚Äôll keep you updated on that, and everything else happening in Victoria. There are fears the lockdown could be extended beyond the end of this week ‚Äì authorities did not sound confident yesterday they had it under control. There are more than 270 exposure sites and 4,000 people considered primary or secondary contacts. Each day has seen a stubborn four to five new cases ‚Äì which have mostly been linked ‚Äì but the sheer numbers point to an extension of the lockdown being likely. I‚Äôm so sorry.

You can find the whole response here but as Josh says, it is not exactly clear whether it is going ahead: And back to estimates, here is where Brendan Murphy, who was identified by Scott Morrison as the source of the ‚Äúnot a race‚Äù comments (which Morrison picked up and ran with, like it was, actually, a race) discussing why he made those comments in the first place (he was talking about the TGA approval). Just on those points, here is a reminder of Richard Colbeck‚Äôs performance in estimates today: Anthony Albanese continued with that line: The truth is there are real human consequences behind the government‚Äôs failure. It had two jobs this year. It had to fix the rollout of the vaccine and it had to have a national quarantine system. And what we‚Äôve seen in both those areas is absolute failure. We‚Äôve seen a government that‚Äôs been prepared to trumpet how well it‚Äôs going, that we were at the front of the queue, that everything was all hunky dory. Greg Hunt, way back in January, remember when he said, ‚Äúthe Eagle has landed; we‚Äôre all set to go here‚Äù, when we‚Äôre not even in the top 100 countries when it comes to the rollout of the vaccine. We have aged care workers working in multiple facilities. We have aged care residents who haven‚Äôt been vaccinated. And we have aged care workers who‚Äôve been told, ‚Äújust go off and get a vaccine somewhere, you‚Äôre on your own‚Äù. The commonwealth government is responsible for aged care. The commonwealth government rollout of the vaccine in aged care facilities has been a debacle with human consequences. And today, we‚Äôve learned as well that the outbreak in the Arcare facility in Melbourne is linked directly to the failure when it comes to South Australian hotel quarantine. So when it comes to this government, the idea that you say it‚Äôs not a race and then you back that up by saying that they‚Äôre comfortable with how it‚Äôs going, I don‚Äôt know what it would take for this Minister to actually be uncomfortable. Somewhere in between the Victorian press conference and question time, Anthony Albanese and Mark Butler held a press conference to talk about the government‚Äôs aged care vaccination roll out. Here is part of it: Albanese: Richard Colbeck‚Äôs extraordinary performance before Senate estimates today makes it difficult to know where to start on the critique of his performance. But this has been a rolling maul of incompetence now ever since he was in the portfolio. It‚Äôs extraordinary that Scott Morrison had the chance to move him when he had the reshuffle but he kept him in this job, in spite of the fact that we know in previous performances before the Senate, he wasn‚Äôt aware of how many deaths there‚Äôd been in aged care. Today, again, he repeated the line where he said that he is comfortable with where we‚Äôre at when it comes to the vaccine rollout. That‚Äôs an extraordinary comment. Australians aren‚Äôt comfortable with where we‚Äôre at with the vaccine rollout. That‚Äôs very clear. Australians aren‚Äôt comfortable with the fact that only eight per cent of staff in aged care are fully vaccinated. Australians aren‚Äôt comfortable that only 355, or 1.5 per cent, of disability care residents have been fully vaccinated. Australians aren‚Äôt comfortable that 21 aged care facilities in Australia are yet to receive the first dose of a vaccine and in almost 600 facilities, the residents haven‚Äôt been fully vaccinated. Australians certainly aren‚Äôt comfortable that this government has been caught out time and time again fudging the numbers when it comes to the vaccine rollout. And Australians aren‚Äôt comfortable with this government leaving behind the older Australians who built our nation. The secretary of the defence department, Greg Moriarty, has warned against insider leaks. At Senate estimates, Moriarty confirmed he had conveyed that message at a meeting of the senior leadership group had been held at the Australian Defence Force Academy in May. Moriarty: Myself, the CDF and other members of the senior leadership group were concerned that there were comments appearing in the press purporting to be from defence personnel. The defence secretary said he had made clear his view that the department had procedures for engaging with media. For people to engage outside that process, Moriarty said, was ‚Äúunprofessional and inappropriate‚Äù. (Moriarty said neither minister Peter Dutton nor Dutton‚Äôs chief of staff had attended the meeting. The chief of the defence force, Angus Campbell, was in attendance.) Anthony Albanese also gives his condolences to Ray Strange‚Äôs loved ones. The defence department has confirmed Peter Dutton‚Äôs office has given it ‚Äúfeedback‚Äù on how it should respond to media enquiries, following reports he has ordered officials to keep responses as brief as possible. Katherine Jones, an associate secretary of defence department, was asked at Senate estimates about a piece published by the Asia-Pacific Defence Reporter on 16 May. The article, by the veteran defence journalist Kym Bergmann, said Dutton had ‚Äúissued an instruction to the department containing the following extremely restrictive measures when responding to requests for information‚Äù: Responses are to be as brief and succinct as possible. Guidance is to limit responses to three paras, regardless of the breadth of the question(s); additional information can be offered on background. Capability-related interviews are unlikely to be approved, be rigidly flexible to revert to written responses. Jones told estimates those quotes were not direct quotes, but ‚Äúcame from an email that was sent by someone within the department purporting to paraphrase‚Äù advice from the minister‚Äôs office. Asked who wrote that email, Jones said it was ‚Äúa low-level officer within the organisation‚Äù. Pressed on who in Dutton‚Äôs office had provided that advice, Jones indicated ‚Äúit was over the course of several communications and it would be with the media team in the minister‚Äôs office‚Äù. In the course of engaging with the minister‚Äôs office around media issues, we received feedback in our ministerial and executive communication area. That general feedback and advice about expectations was then communicated more broadly to the senior leadership. Question time ends. Scott Morrison gives his condolences to photojournalist Ray Strange, who passed away over the weekend. Is Scott Morrison ‚Äúcomfortable‚Äù with the vaccine rollout in aged care, given his minister Richard Colbeck says he is? Morrison: We want to keep rolling out the vaccination program as quickly and as safely and as efficiently as possible and that is why, Mr Speaker I am. Mr Speaker, it is a good thing that particularly for those aged over 70, that we have got 53.65% of the population aged over 70 Mr Speaker having received their first dose. Now that compares in New Zealand Mr Speaker, to 31.56 per cent. The key part of our vaccination strategy which I referred to previously has been to focus on those particular populations that are most vulnerable and that is those who are in residential aged care facilities. And the coverage of those residential aged care facilities Mr Speaker has been significant, has been significant, particularly as we go into the winter months Mr Speaker, and the coverage of all of those facilities on their first doses Mr Speaker, and we must now move quickly to ensure the balance of those doses are provided and the second most of those in residential aged care facilities but as we look around the world and we look particularly at countries... who have been successful in suppressing the virus and where the context of a rolling out the vaccine Mr Speaker. A similar situation be it in South Korea or Japan or countries such as that where the virus has been suppressed, Australia and New Zealand equally suppressed, and we can point to a vaccination rate particularly for over 70s which is many times that of light countries so Mr Speaker, there is much want to do and we will remain focused on protecting the most vulnerable in our community as part of the national vaccination strategy which, in the past month Mr Speaker, in the past month has seen us go from 320,792 vaccine a week to 672,000 vaccinations a week, in one month, a doubling of the total number of vaccinations conducted every week Mr Speaker. This is, this is where a vaccination program is getting to and that is to the great support and advantage of Australia. There were not a lot of full stops in that answer. Scott Morrison continues his ‚Äòwe are the world‚Äô style answer, as he tries to explain why the federal government is responsible for vaccinations and also, not responsible for aged care. Mark Butler asks: This morning, the aged care minister was asked if the government was responsible for the vaccine rollout in aged care, yes or no? The minister replied it is not a yes or no answer. So I ask the prime minister, is the government responsible for vaccine rollout in aged care? Morrison: The government is indeed responsible for the national vaccination strategy, right across the country. We are doing it in partnership with states and territories, of course we are, general practitioners and a whole range of others who are supporting these efforts. In hospitals and elsewhere. The national vaccination strategy was brought together by Professor Brendan Murphy who chairs the scientific advisory group on immunisation, but national strategy was pulled together which includes for aged care, and it was taken to the federal cabinet and endorsed and taken to the national cabinet and endorsed and all of the roles and responsibilities that all the various levels of government having delivering vaccination program. And that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm pleased that yesterday, yesterday again, Mr Speaker, we saw over 100,000 people get vaccinated in this country. In the course of May, more than two million Australians were vaccinated. Now, at the end of last month, since the end of last month, the weekly vaccinations have doubled. And that followed intervention that was undertaken by myself as chair of the national cabinet, bringing the states and territories together and since we put in place that additional plan which addressed the challenges faced by the ATAGI advice on AstraZeneca and the challenges on supply vaccines, Mr Speaker, we put the planning in place together, work together, and the vaccination rate doubled within a month month Mr Speaker*. This is what the government does, it addresses problems, it gets people together, it focuses on the issue, and it addresses the challenges that Australia faces. In Victoria we are facing challenges but we will overcome those challenges, the people of Victoria will overcome those challenges, the government of Australia will work, Mr Speaker with the Victorian government to ensure that our focus is on individual Victorians and to ensure that we open up Victoria Mr Speaker, as soon as we possibly can. And Mr Speaker, from the data we see I hope it is particularly true for regional Victoria. What we see in regional Victoria Mr Speaker, and the evidence that is there, we look forward to regional Victoria being open as soon as possible. But we will work together, we will follow the health advice, we will listen carefully to what Mr Speaker, and we will continue to protect lives and protect livelihoods Mr Speaker. That is the focus of my government and will keep fighting the virus, Mr Speaker, the Labor but it will keep fighting us. *That is how Morrison is describing calling in the states to help with the vaccine rollout, after the federal government messed it up. Lols. Now Tony Smith is rebuking Karen Andrews for creating interjections and for essentially creating outrage over two comments. (You know, like when conservatives claim they have been ‚Äòcancelled‚Äô over little seen and little engaged with social media posts?) Smith: I will say to the minister, I heard one or two interjections that I could not decipher, and the response to that has now caused a wave of interjections. She was asked a very specific question, we have instances where ministers say they will take the interjection, can I say they have no right to take the interjection, if anyone is going to intervene, I will, and there is not an opportunity to give those on the other side the character assessment, you are not asked about that because it is not within the standing orders. Karen Andrews has somehow linked Labor interjecting during question time to Labor being ‚Äúsoft on crime‚Äù. That‚Äôs some galaxy brain thinking right there. Why did Prof Brendan Murphy say the vaccine roll out wasn‚Äôt a race? (As pointed to by Scott Morrison in his first answer today.) Murphy says he was referring to the TGA approvals: He then manages to concede that it is not a helpful phrase. Speaking on not helpful, Michael McCormack said it as recently as this weekend. Of course, numbers are one thing ‚Äì but how that money is being spent is another. Pat Conroy put out this release following defence estimates today: Labor‚Äôs analysis of the latest Defence Budget papers reveals major declines in the availability of ships, helicopters and planes since the release of the 2016 Defence White Paper. During this same period, sustainment costs have blown out by almost $5bn. Sustainment of our weapons systems has been a basket case for far too long. As reported today, all of the Navy‚Äôs major combatant ships have been out of action for more than half of every year since 2016. Defence‚Äôs poster child, the Joint Strike Fighter, continues to be a major concern, flying only 64 per cent of its planned hours. This is our newest aircraft and therefore should be our most reliable, so it‚Äôs concerning that it is already significantly underperforming. Our critical platforms continue to be out of action far more than defence and the Morrison government plan and budget for. This underperformance predates the Covid-19 pandemic and has continued in the last year. Some of the lack of availability and cost blowouts are undoubtedly related to the long list of new equipment that is delayed under this Government, forcing older weapon systems to run longer than planned. However, just as concerning is the fact that some of the Australian Defence Force‚Äôs newest equipment is nowhere close to meeting the required availability. How can minister Dutton claim that he and the government have our troops‚Äô backs when they cannot even ensure that our planes, helicopters and ships are available to the level deemed necessary? Peter Dutton continues with his ongoing series ‚Äòwe live in an uncertain part of the world‚Äô and here is how much we have spent to keep you safe. It of course, includes that Labor took money out of defence spending. And another mention of ‚Äúuncertain times‚Äù. All of this is building towards a ‚Äòwho do you trust to keep you safe‚Äô conclusion, which will be the narrative that gets louder as we get closer to the election Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: My question is to the prime minister and I refer to the fact that just 15% of aged care workers have been fully vaccinated, even though the government announced that aged care workers would be fully vaccinated by Easter. In April the government announced it would establish 13 dedicated pop-up clinics to vaccinate aged care workers by the end of May, it is now June. Only three are operating. How many of those clinics are operating in Victoria today? Morrison: On workforce vaccinations some 72,707 vaccinations of staff and non-residents has been completed, 39,874 have received a first dose and 32,833 have received a second dose One of the early decisions taken by the AHPPC when I looked into this matter by the national cabinet was whether aged care workers should have mandated vaccinations in aged care facilities, Mr Speaker, and when this was put to the AHPPC, the medical expert panel, they did not agree to recommend that, Mr Speaker, but I will ask the minister to add further to the answer. Greg Hunt takes it and starts talking about something else ‚Äì the five different channels workers can get vaccinated in. Albanese jumps up: The question was ... they promised 13 dedicated pop-up clinics to vaccinate aged care workers by the end of May, only three are operating, how many of those, it was just one question, how many are in Victoria today? I will give you a clue, it is a really round number. (The answer is zero.) Hunt gets back to his answer and comes up with a lot of words to confirm there are no clinics in Victoria. Hunt: There are five channels for vaccination, one is commonwealth in reach, two is the pop-up program around Australia, 1,887 workers have been vaccinated through the pop-up program, and yes, those facilities are about to be established within Victoria. In addition to that, there is the general practice program, in addition to that there is a GP respiratory, GP respiratory program, and in addition to that there are state clinics. And in particular, state clinics are providing priority to aged care workers which serves the same purpose within the Victorian context as a pop-up in another context. Clare O‚ÄôNeil, who is Zooming in from Melbourne, asks about why the government has missed its own targets with the aged care vaccinations. Greg Hunt gives the same figures we have heard multiple times today, but doesn‚Äôt answer the question. O‚ÄôNeil‚Äôs camera angle means all we see is her head, which means we all see a very big screen slow shake of the head. Mark Dreyfus (wearing a mask and asking his questions from a separate microphone away from the despatch box) to Greg Hunt: The minister said that first dose Covid-19 vaccinations for Victorian aged care facilities were complete. But I have confirmed this morning that residents in an aged care facility in my electorate have still not have their first vaccine dose. How can the minister statement be true? Greg Hunt: I would be happy to receive the details of the facility because I have confirmed on multiple occasions with my department that all commonwealth facilities have been completed. We did have drawn to our attention one facility which was misidentified as a commonwealth facility which, in fact, is under the responsibility of the Victorian government and I don‚Äôt know if that is the facility the Member has not named it but the department has reaffirmed the advice to senate estimates today that all commonwealth facilities have been completed. Including Jewish Care house which was raised by the member for McNamara last week. And it was completed as we said it would be. And so I am aware that one case was raised on a television program last night and we have spoken with the granddaughter of the I believe it is the granddaughter of the resident in question and it has been confirmed that it is not a commonwealth facility so our advice is expressed and clear and absolute from the department that all commonwealth residential aged care facilities in Victoria have had a first dose. And in RBA news... Just on those figures: Jim Chalmers to Josh Frydenberg: Victorians wouldn‚Äôt be lockdown today if it wasn‚Äôt for the Morrison government‚Äôs failures on vaccines and quarantine. Why has this treasurer refused to provide any additional support to small businesses and workers hardest hit by these failures? What kind of Victorian abandons Victorians in their hour of need? Frydenberg: This treasurer, this prime minister, this government has provided more support to Victoria than any previous government, Mr Speaker. More support than any previous government. I know, I know the member Rankin‚Äôs maths aren‚Äôt too good ... He has been doing the numbers for some time, and he still can‚Äôt even get to two, Mr Speaker. He can‚Äôt get to two. But the reality is, we have provided, we have provided the Morrison government has provided more than $45bn already to families and businesses across Victoria. Now the state treasurer of Victoria has confirmed that the state government has delivered $13bn, so that is more, that is less than one-third... That is less than a third than what we had the federal level have delivered. The people of Victoria have received on a per capita basis more from the Morrison government over the course of Covid than any other state or territory. More than any other state or territory. And we have provided more than $28bn of jobkeeper payments to the people of Victoria. We have supported ... cash flow boost to the people of Victoria. We have provided around $5bn in jobkeeper coronavirus supplement payment. Around $3bn in direct payments to veterans, to carers, to pensioners across Victoria. And I remind the honourable member that Victoria is not the only state that has gone into lockdown after the end of jobkeeper. His own state in Queensland, in Brisbane, saw stay-at-home orders in late March, early April. We know that the Perth metropolitan area and the Peel region also saw between 24 April and 27 April stay-at-home orders, Mr Speaker, and now in Victoria. According to the Victorian government this is a seven-day lockdown. And it is a short lockdown, and we anticipate it at the time of the budget that there would be outbreaks, and indeed that they would be short lockdown. That is why we provided an unprecedented amount of support in this budget and in previous budgets, including $41bn in direct economic support to support and strengthen our recovery, the state of Victoria, as well as across the nation. Josh Frydenberg is yelling a dixer answer on why the federal government doesn‚Äôt have to provide financial support to Victoria during this lockdown. The answer is because the government has previously provided ‚Äúunprecedented‚Äù level of support previously. I am sure my boss will accept that I have previously performed my work duties, and so will not need to provide further work duties, as I can just point to my previous work. That‚Äôs how it works right? You do your job once, and then don‚Äôt have to do it again? Stuart Robert just pulled out his phone to show Andrew Wilkie how people can see what they owe the government. Just two clicks he says. That‚Äôs assuming people know how to use MyGov. That they are technologically literate. That if they are, they have access to a smart phone, or an internet connection. There is just so much patronising privilege in the display, it is actually difficult to take seriously. This from someone who tried to charge the taxpayer nearly $38,000 for his home internet usage (he paid it back). Just ahead of question time, Tim Watts gave a speech: Mark Butler to Greg Hunt: The minister‚Äôs comments on Thursday night contained no mention of first [vaccine] doses only. So why did the minister use the term ‚Äúcompleted‚Äù in response to a question about a two-dose vaccine? Hunt: It has been absolutely clear as we have talked in question time and in multiple circumstances around the country, that the program we have been undertaking is to conduct the process of vaccinating aged care facilities, working through first doses and working through second doses. And it is absolutely and fundamentally clear, as Professor Murphy, Professor Kelly, Professor Kidd, who have all indicated in recent days that the first doses is a fundamentally important part and indeed provides critical context ‚Äì a protection and the vaccination program which we have referred to on many occasions refers to the total number of facilities which have had those first vaccinations, and second vaccinations. The advice that I have before me as of last night was that 2,544 facilities which have had first doses around the country, or 99 per cent, 100 per cent of those four jurisdictions... Butler has a point of order: The question was a very specific question in relation to advice the minister gave on Thursday night, not data now, but advice on a two-dose vaccine. Hunt: And to add to that, the advice received from the department shortly before question time, 1,957 facilities, or 76 per cent of national facilities have had a second dose. And we have at all times drawn the distinction and pointed to the fact that we have a two-dose regime, our immediate task, immediate task was to set out and ensure that we are on a path to make every facility in Australia have that option of a first dose at the earliest possible time, and now we are at that point, where 100 per cent of facilities in four states and territories, Victoria, the Northern Territory, the ACT and Tasmania, have received that, with the remaining four states and territories to have that 1 per cent closed in the coming days, an expected 15, possibly higher is higher 17, but the stage of those 20 scheduled for the next two days. It is very important thing, as the chief medical officer and the deputy chief medical officer and the former chief medical officer have emphasised, to have that first dose in place. And there has been some discussion and indeed I heard Professor Kelly makes some very clear remarks on this front last week, that the first dose is absolutely critical, that it provides the balance of protection. ...But in terms of, there was an indication that this was not a critical thing, and this was a discussion handled in question time of last week. As we say, 100 per cent of facilities across those four states and territories completed as we say on Friday, and 99 per cent across the country. The current deputy prime minister is on his feet, doing his best to once again demonstrate the difference between meritocracy and mediocrity and why they are so often confused. Greg Hunt admits in question time he misread the department advice when he said just six aged care facilities hadn‚Äôt been visited for their first dose ‚Äì the department told estimates today, it was 21 sites, as of yesterday. I did make an error yesterday. My mistake. My apologies. Nobody else‚Äôs fault but mine. The department‚Äôs advice was correct and the misreading was my fault. Which is different to what the committee heard, as Sarah Martin reported earlier this afternoon: Before the committee breaks for lunch, Michael Lye from the department clarifies to the committee that it was a departmental error that led health minister Greg Hunt to ‚Äúconflate‚Äù the number of doses with the number of people vaccinated in the aged care workforce. So everyone is Spartacus. Scott Morrison uses a dixer on his New Zealand trip to say how well Australia is doing in its vaccine rollout. As you could imagine, it is all about aged care and vaccinations. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Does the prime minister still say that vaccinating all the Australians, including aged care residents and workers, is, to quote him, ‚Äúnot a race‚Äù? Morrison: The reference to not a race Mr Speaker was first said by the secretary of the Department of Health, Professor Brendan Murphy, and the chair of the scientific and technical advisory group on immunisation, Mr Speaker, and I affirm his remarks. I affirmed his remarks. I affirm the remarks of the secretary of health. Because all the way through, all the way through this pandemic, one of the key factors that both our government and the governments around the country and indeed governments in other countries is that we have always been mindful of the expert advice informing the decisions that we have taken. And that reference was made by the secretary, Mr Speaker, and it was affirmed by me, Mr Speaker, in a way that was consistent in the way that I have always considered very carefully the advice provided by Professor Murphy. If those opposite want to play politics with the advice provided by our medical experts, Mr Speaker, and seek to call into question the references made by the secretary... ...I share his view. The question for those opposite is why do they call into question the advice that is provided to the government... There is a point of order from Albanese: On direct relevance, the question asked the prime minister whether he will take responsibility for his own words. You cannot just flick past it and tried to say reframe the question that Labor is wanting to criticise someone else. He is the one who said it and the question asks him if he takes responsibility for it. Morrison: I do stand behind my words, I do stand behind my words. And my words were based on the expert advice of the chair of the scientific and technical advisory group Professor Brendan Murphy but he was not alone on the third of March 2021, where it says this is not a race, that is from Queensland Health, Mr Speaker, on their own Twitter feed. So it is the medical advice in using that terminology at that time. I listen to the medical advice. Those opposite may want to call into question the advice provided by our medical experts such as Professor Murphy. But I certainly will not and they cannot run away from the imputation they have put in this place, right here and now, calling into question the judgement of Professor Murphy. Before question time, two little snippets from defence estimates: Asked about the fresh review of the lease of the Port of Darwin to a Chinese company, the defence secretary, Greg Moriarty, said the prime minister had directed the department ‚Äúto do some work‚Äù and that is ‚Äúclose to finalisation‚Äù. But that work is yet to be presented to the minister, Peter Dutton, and through him to government. On the future submarine program, Penny Wong asks officials whether it‚Äôs still the case that the first new submarine will be delivered in 2032 and testing and evaluation would be completed by 2034. Greg Sammut, of the defence department, said: ‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt changed that schedule at this point, Senator.‚Äù Asked about then defence minister Kevin Andrews‚Äô comments in 2015 that the submarines ‚Äúmust be delivered in time to avoid a capability gap in the mid-2020s‚Äù, Sammut said: ‚ÄúAll I can say is it was never defence‚Äôs view that we could deliver submarines by the mid 2020s.‚Äù It being Tuesday, the Labor caucus has also met today. It was mostly housekeeping, but there was a debate about a disallowance motion proposed by the independent Zali Steggall about gas development in the Beetaloo Basin. Labor resolved to oppose the Stegall motion (which was the recommendation from the shadow minister Madeline King), but the decision triggered a debate. I gather Ged Kearney and Libby Coker opposed the recommendation. But Joel Fitzgibbon and the Norther Territory MPs supported King‚Äôs position. Fitzgibbon noted that Labor‚Äôs policy included a role for gas, so the party needed to be consistent. And that is the end of the Victorian press conference. What did we learn? Two of the three cases we didn‚Äôt know about yesterday are close contacts of confirmed cases. A third is not, but was nearby exposure sites. Victoria has launched a ‚Äúfive day blitz‚Äù to vaccinate aged care and disability workers who fall under the federal government jurisdiction, to try and speed up the vaccine rollout. Still no word on whether or not lockdown will be lifted as scheduled on Thursday. There is just under 10 minutes until question time. Get ready for that. When will Daniel Andrews be back at work? As the acting premier made clear yesterday, the premier released a statement in the not-too-distant past thanking Victorians for the warm wishes for his recovery, and indicating that his recovery was progressing well, and that he is expected to be back in June. ...Today is the first day of June and I‚Äôm pretty sure it goes for a few more weeks yet. Are disability care workers working across multiple sites (like private aged care workers are, under the federal jurisdiction). State disability minister Luke Donnellan: We‚Äôve got a couple of bits to that question. The residential sector in terms of residential accommodation got transferred as of last night fully to the commonwealth so we had 45% of the residential provided, 45% of residents for people with disabilities so that got transferred to the commonwealth as of yesterday and a process of transferring multiple facilities over time. We had the worker mobility reduction payment in place and have had that up to literally last night in place to minimise one worker at one site, period. That has been in place until last night. I raised that with the federal minister, specifically to say that with the transfer of the 45% of the remaining residences, that worker mobility payment we won‚Äôt be paying any more because they are no longer under our governance and we are no longer responsible for them, under the NDIS agreement. I raised that with the minister last night for consideration and I expect she will be back to me over the coming days. Martin Foley: I think we will only all be satisfied when every Victorian who is eligible to be vaccinated is vaccinated. We can‚Äôt rest as a community ‚Äì all levels of government need to put their shoulder to the wheel together to achieve that outcome. I am concerned. It is why the government is prioritising today at the expense of other Victorians who would be eligible under the ceiling of vaccines that we‚Äôve been allocated, to deliver to precisely those workforces that have priority access. These are people who care for our most vulnerable residents who we saw in 2020 in Victoria and New South Wales to a lesser degree, the virus got into these workplaces not the residents or participants but through a workforce contact. We need to make sure that those workforces are vaccinated, not just for their own good but primarily for the good of the people that they care for and look after. Is Martin Foley concerned with how slow the roll out is going in disability care facilities? Foley: I‚Äôm always concerned that any committee transmission which we have in Victoria. We‚Äôve seen it in the last few days in private residential aged care and I‚Äôd be extremely concerned if it got into NDIS covered residential disability services. My understanding is the Commonwealth have, through private contractors, committed to ramping up their in reach services into those disability services. I understand that doesn‚Äôt cover staff, hence our announcement today that we want to prioritise those staff in our next 5-day blitz in this area. If you can‚Äôt make it to one of our state blitzes, you have either a disability or residential aged care worker, the right to see your participating GP to get your vaccine. Martin Foley on why the state government is now vaccinating private health care workers: There were arrangements in place for the staff if they were there at the time, and there was leftovers and other arrangement on a different basis, but as a result of some of those issues, or the stay stood up a couple of weeks ago, to indicate that we were prepared to support the private residential aged care system through our systems, and Victoria we wrote to all of those providers, there was a degree of take-up, remembering of course that most of the vaccines that are in fact distributed in Victoria are still through the GP network, and many of these people, if they had been vaccinated, they had gone to their GP, but we do not have oversight of that data. So we know from this most recent cases that are significant numbers of those private residential aged care service staff and NDIS disability staff, are not vaccinated, hence our priority call for the next five days. Martin Foley continues: Every day in the global pandemic is pretty grim, and we need to make sure that the hard work that all of Victorians are putting into this outbreak, that‚Äôs the real risk that we are facing particularly at a aged care setting, particularly at our high-risk private residential aged care settings, I take it into account. Victorians have sacrificed more than anyone else around the nation when it comes to making sure that we ‚Äì as we very recently had ‚Äì 86 continuous days of no community transmission. What to do is to make sure that our effort reflects the value of that sacrifice, and avoid the risk that we saw last winter of the devastation this causes private residential aged care. I think Victorians really expect that of the government, and that is what we will be doing. Victorian health minister Martin Foley on the day by day proposition of the lockdown: I am only as confident as the last test and the last piece of data that we receive, because we know that this is so unpredictable, whilst we increasingly come to understand how the virus moved, and our knowledge both in Australia and globally has gone ahead in leaps and bounds of the past 18 months, it is still in many ways a rapidly evolving virus that is of real challenge. I cannot share with people what we have yet to land through our public health teams. As soon as we do have those recommendations from our public health teams, we will be back those announcements to the people. Not-for-profit aged care providers have responded to news that the federal government is considering making vaccines mandatory for aged care workers. Aged and Community Services Australia (ACSA) says the main issue is not mandatory vaccines. It is ease of access. ACSA chair Sara Blunt says the government must stop blaming providers or workers for a rollout that is ‚Äúits responsibility‚Äù. If the Covid-19 vaccine is available at workplaces then we‚Äôll see a significant pick up and improvements to coverage in aged care quickly. The main issue right now is not whether the vaccine is mandatory, it‚Äôs whether workers can get easy access. The government has to stop blaming providers or workers when the roll out is its responsibility. Our workers are amongst the hardest working yet poorly paid in the care and service industries and the fewer barriers we put in front of them to get a vaccine the better. In Victoria in particular workers right now will be primarily concerned with the immediate health of the older people in their care and also themselves and their families. Back to Victoria, Martin Foley says he doesn‚Äôt know if there will be a lockdown extension or not, but the aged care settings are ‚Äútroubling‚Äù. He says as soon as they get the advice, they‚Äôll let people know, either way. The federal treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, told the Coalition party room the budget was put together when it was assumed there would be outbreaks across the country and short lockdowns and that‚Äôs why the government kept the foot on the accelerator with $41bn in related economic support. He said: Victoria came to us to ask for assistance, because it was a short lockdown we said it was a scale that could be managed at a local level. They ran a pretty desperate attempt to smear us when in reality the numbers tell a very different story, Victoria has received more on a per capita basis than any other state. We‚Äôve already delivered $45bn plus to families and businesses, where the state government has delivered $13bn. Back to health estimates and Katy Gallagher is now asking Colbeck about the five-day blitz running from Wednesday to Sunday just announced by the Victorian government. Gallagher asks why it is being left to the state to ‚Äúcome in and basically do a blitz to get aged and disability care workers vaccinated to generate the momentum needed.‚Äù Colbeck says the process of rollout is happening ‚Äúcollaboratively‚Äù. I am very pleased that the Victorian government is giving preference to residential aged care staff given the health advice that we are providing the vaccine resource to the state. Before the committee breaks for lunch, Michael Lye from the department clarifies to the committee that it was a departmental error that led health minister Greg Hunt to ‚Äúconflate‚Äù the number of doses with the number of people vaccinated in the aged care workforce. Gallagher said officials were taking the blame on behalf of Hunt. Has Mr Hunt‚Äôs office been in touch? I can see what‚Äôs happened. You‚Äôre taking the heat for his office coming and getting cranky at evidence. We know. I have dealt with him on the phone. I know what he is like. Rude. 732 residences were physically checked yesterday, with help from the ADF. Eight individuals of ‚Äúreal concern‚Äù were not home. They are being followed up through the enforcement division. Still no confirmation the Victorian lockdown will end on Thursday. It is still a day by day watch and wait situation. Jeroen Weimar: There are over 300 exposure sites now on a website and I encourage people to use the website for this. We‚Äôve identified a number of retail strips. These are precincts we know some of our cases have been. There are exposure sites at all these streets but I‚Äôm using this as a way to get people‚Äôs attention. ...We are now keen to starting to drain the swamp to see what else is out there. Is anybody else out there we haven‚Äôt caught? Is there anybody else not been caught by exposure sites? There have been at least four cases in the current outbreak of 54 who are not known to other cases ‚Äì but have come into contact with each other at one of the exposure sites. So it is not necessarily face to face, or touch to touch contact. Jeroen Weimar says this variant means that sort of transmission is happening more often: What we‚Äôre seeing now is people are brushing past each other in a small shop, they are going to a display home, they are looking at photos in a Telstra shop. This is relatively speaking, relatively fleeting. They do not know each other‚Äôs lives, and that is very different from what we have been before. So if you have been to one of those exposure sites, get tested. Rex Patrick is asking about the decision-making process for government grants for promising vaccines late last year. He is also asking whether health officials were aware of ferret trials being done by CSIRO last year. Yes, they were aware of the ferrets. He is concerned about the secrecy surrounding the grant process, saying there is a ‚Äúcomplete lack of transparency‚Äù around the program and the decisions made by the grant access opportunity committee. Not really many Qs so far, but he is calling it a ‚Äúcorruption incubator‚Äù. Patrick is giving a presentation about the US equivalent which releases more information publicly. It is hugely concerning. This is like sports rorts but with people who have the ability to inject steroids into it. This is all covered in secrecy endorsed by you people. He says $20bn is awarded ‚Äúbehind closed doors‚Äù through the Medical Research Future Fund. Brendan Murphy says it is not publicly disclosed who sits on the medical research future fund panels, but the conflict of interest policy process is ‚Äúvery very rigorous‚Äù. Patrick is told that the National Health and Medical Research Council will appear for questioning later. Clare O‚ÄôNeil has responded to Richard Colbeck‚Äôs evidence in Senate estimates today: Greg Hunt told the public yesterday that roughly 70,000 aged care workers had been vaccinated. The truth revealed in estimates by health officials today is that number is less than half ‚Äì about 32,800. Less than 10% of the aged care workforce has been vaccinated and yet the virus is not only at large in our general community it is today being found within our aged care system. The level of deceptive incompetence of this government and the minster responsible for aged care is utterly breathtaking. Their negligence in aged care is callous, cruel and dangerous. Victorians in particular right now must surely be disgusted. The government must immediately deliver a detailed plan with clear vaccine targets for the aged care workforce. This is essential. Targets ensure urgency and right now the Morrison government display no urgency at all. When will half the aged care workforce be vaccinated? When will three quarters be done? Targets must be set. Lives at at risk. Vaccination waits in Melbourne at the moment are running at about a three-hour wait. If you have been to any of these shopping centres in Melbourne in the last two weeks, Victorian authorities want you to come forward for testing ‚Äì even if you are not symptomatic: Craigieburn Central Bay Street in Port Melbourne Clarendon Street in South Melbourne Pacific Epping, also known as the Epping Plaza The Epping North shopping centre Broadway Reservoir Positive cases have been in those areas and authorities just want to make sure they are stamping out any transmission. Katy Gallagher is continuing to target the government over the low vaccination rate among the aged care workforce. Colbeck claims that ‚Äúevery worker in aged care has access through those various channels now.‚Äù ‚ÄúThey all have access to a vaccine and they have had for a period of time,‚Äù he said. However he says that this has not been reported under the current system, which does not record occupation. Gallagher says that the government was avoiding its responsibility to the workforce. ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre not responsible for vaccinating aged care workers ... and you are saying it is over to you aged care workers, go and get it done.‚Äù She also questioned one of the channels ‚Äì the Sonic clinics ‚Äì saying just three were operating in NSW rather than the 13 promised. Murray Watt then challenged Colbeck on how Australia compares with other countries, saying we were running 113th when it comes to doses per hundred people, behind countries such as Tonga, Panama and El Salvador. Colbeck said Australia was in the ‚Äúmiddle of the pack‚Äù, when compared with the progress of other countries at a similar stage of the rollout. There is still a missing link between the person who contracted Covid in Adelaide hotel quarantine and the first City of Whittlesea and Port of Melbourne cases, which authorities are still looking for. Victorian Covid commander Jeroen Weimar says of the 4,200 primary and secondary contacts of known cases who have been isolated, 75% have returned negative test results. The Victorian aged care and disability services minister Luke Donnellan says Victoria will undertake a ‚Äúfive-day blitz‚Äù and step in to vaccinate workers in vulnerable settings: This means from Wednesday 2 June to Sunday 6 June, workers in the private sector aged care facilities and the residential disability sector, all managed by the commonwealth, will be given priority access to walk-in vaccination hubs around Victoria between 9am and 4pm when they present evidence of their employment. The following vaccination hubs are participating in the five-day blitz including the Royal Exhibition Building, the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre, Sandown racecourse, the Melbourne Showgrounds, the former Ford factory in Geelong, Bendigo community clinic, Ballarat Mercure Hotel and Convention Centre, Shepparton Showgrounds, that Macintosh Centre, to Elgin racecourse and the Wodonga vaccination hub. Aged care and disability workers are currently eligible to be vaccinated at state hubs but this is about stimulating that demand and getting more workers to get greater coverage at the private aged care sector and the disability sector. We have concerns there isn‚Äôt enough coverage that is why we are stepping in. It has been available but this is very much a call to arms of those workers on the frontline to come out and we will give you a priority lane so it makes it quicker and easier to get through it in a speedier time because we very much want to ensure we are protecting those audible people and the aged care facilities and stability sector from Covid-19. This is good news though. Martin Foley: I‚Äôm also able to advise that all staff and residents at Blue Cross Sunshine aged care facility have tested negative other than that one case reported on yesterday, the crossover worker between Arcare Maidstone and Blue Cross Sunshine. There are being no positive tests further at Arcare Maidstone. These sites remain under strict infection and prevention control measures and I want to particularly thank the Western public health unit for leading the work and thank the wonderful clinical staff and particularly the nurses from both Melbourne Health and Western Health who have stood into these important factual prevention and control measures and to support both those facilities as a result of their own staff having to be furloughed and quarantined. I can also advise that another BlueCross facility which shared a worker advised that we talked about yesterday, that that site has been stood down as an infection risk as the particular worker was non-infectious at the period that they worked at the other BlueCross site. Health minister Martin Foley is giving today‚Äôs update: He says of the three new cases (there were nine in total in the 24 hours to midnight, but we knew about six of them yesterday) two have been linked ‚Äì but one has not, as yet. Foley: Two of these three are primary close contacts who were quarantining during their infectious period which is good news. One is still under investigation. They are not a contact and are not are directly linked to any exposure site but there is very close proximity to that exposure site and we are confident the investigation ongoing will uncover further crossover. Our public health team are seeing more and more of this in this particular South Australian hotel outbreak playing out a bit differently to earlier outbreaks. There is evidence of casual acquisition instead of those indirect close contact my friends at a pub, family members. Richard Colbeck says ‚Äúevery worker in aged care has access through those various channels to a vaccine‚Äù. Those channels are ‚Äì see your GP, go to the state/territory hub, or on-site vaccination if there are extra vaccines left over. ‚ÄúThey all have access to vaccines, and they have for some time,‚Äù Colbeck says. But if a worker can get a day off to go get the vaccine, under their own steam, the government doesn‚Äôt know they have had it. Katy Gallagher: ‚ÄúHow many staff [have been vaccinated]‚Äù Richard Colbeck: ‚ÄúYou have asked a black and white question, where there is not a black and white answer.‚Äù We also don‚Äôt know how many staff in disability care have been vaccinated. In disability care settings, 3500 residents have received first or second doses ‚Äì just 355 have had two doses. That‚Äôs out of 22,285 residents. He has said this practically every party room meeting this year. The party room briefings have begun. Moving on from red carpets to related matters. Labor‚Äôs Tim Ayres then turns his attention to the use of the Top Gun theme song when Scott Morrison walked into Williamtown back in February for a Joint Strike Fighter event. ‚ÄúVery loudly, I think,‚Äù says Ayres. Mel Hupfeld, the chief of the air force, says he is aware of that, because he was at the event. Hupfeld quips: I thought they were playing that for me - I was the only top gun in that group. Were there any discussions about the music with the PM‚Äôs team in advance of the event? Hupfeld says that event had been hosted by an industry partner, BAE Systems Australia: My belief is that was put on as part of the organisation of that particular event on that occasion through the industry partner. Ayres says it speaks to Morrison‚Äôs ‚Äúself-importance‚Äù, adding: Normally serious people don‚Äôt require theme music. Greg Hunt said yesterday there were six aged care facilities waiting on their first dose of the vaccine. Health officials said as of yesterday, it was 21. Here is the table which was just tabled in health estimates: All we know from the figures the government has is that just over 33,000 aged care staff, out of 360,000 or so staff nationally, have been vaccinated. That‚Äôs under 10%. From Friday, aged care providers will have a new system to report vaccinations. That‚Äôs from Friday. Until now, it has been voluntary. The chief of the air force has blamed ‚Äúprotocol creep‚Äù for the red carpet treatment afforded to Scott Morrison when he visited a base near Newcastle last month - and has signalled he is ‚Äútaking steps‚Äù to ensure there is no repeat. There was a spirited exchange with defence reps at Senate estimates this morning about the prime minister‚Äôs arrival at RAAF Williamtown base last month. Morrison‚Äôs team posted the photo of his red carpet arrival on a social media platform - something that the Labor senator Tim Ayres described as ‚Äúextraordinary‚Äù. Mel Hupfeld, the chief of the air force, played down any suggestion that the prime minister had requested that sort of treatment. But he said there was ‚Äúsome ambiguity‚Äù in the standard directive across the air force when it came to arrival protocols: We would use a stair guard to welcome appropriate VIPs to various bases when they arrive. In the case that I think you‚Äôre referring to, there was an example where a red carpet was used. That was a decision that the base executives made and there were some ambiguities in our instructions ... The instructions just said that appropriate stair guards can be used for VIP visitors and a picture was included in our instructions that included a red carpet. The base executives then took it upon themselves to use a red carpet for that particular arrival. Hupfeld said he was taking accountability for ‚Äúwhat I would call protocol creep within the executives on some of our bases‚Äù. I am taking steps to remedy that to ensure that the use of stair guards is appropriate for ceremonial events, and in working across the defence enterprise now for ceremonial occasions, then my intent is to only use red carpet as a key example here for regal, vice-regal or head of state occasions, welcoming those types of personnel on to our military bases. (That means limiting the red carpet treatment to visitors such as Australia‚Äôs governor general and heads of state of other countries.) Hupfeld said his understanding was that the VIP operations team ‚Äúwill have advised the prime minister‚Äôs office that there would be a stair guard on arrival but they did not mention anything in terms of a red carpet‚Äù. People who were in 1A - the highest priority vaccine cohort - were meant to have their vaccinations completed in six weeks. That includes aged care. 14 weeks or so on, nationally, 64% of aged care residents have been fully vaccinated. And we don‚Äôt know how many staff. The bells are ringing for the start of the parliament session. What a day. We are getting some more detail on the percentage of aged care residents who have been vaccinated in the 110 days the vaccination program has been running. Across the country, 64% of residents have been fully vaccinated. In Victoria, just 57% of residents have been fully vaccinated. Melissa Davey has read through some articles on the variant of Covid Victoria is currently dealing with: Today‚Äôs Victorian update will come at 12.30pm. Malcolm Roberts: ‚ÄúWhat does that mean, I‚Äôm not a lawyer.‚Äù Health official: ‚ÄúI was once, but it was a long time ago.‚Äù Roberts: Did you become honest, did you? No, we have lawyers who are good friends. We have good friends who are lawyers. He laughs. Malcolm Roberts is going down the unproven Covid treatments question rabbit hole. And yet, this is still somehow not as bad as when he questions climate scientists. That is saying something. Malcolm Roberts is now asking the health officials questions. A cursed sentence. So far, there have been 54 cases in this Victorian outbreak. That includes the nine cases today (although we knew about six of those, so it‚Äôs three new cases). We are still waiting to hear when Victorian authorities will hold a press conference. AAP has been watching Treasury estimates: Treasury boss Steven Kennedy says overseas events clearly show the pandemic is not over and there are heightened risks to Australia‚Äôs and the world‚Äôs recovery. He told a Senate hearing on Tuesday the outbreak in Melbourne reinforces this point: Despite this, here in Australia the domestic economy has continued to recover and grow strongly. The recovery has been stronger than from any major downturn in recent history. Australian economic growth outperformed all major advanced economies in 2020. We have seen employment and hours worked rise above their pre-pandemic levels. He put this performance down to the success of suppressing the virus at a relatively low economic cost and that fiscal policy has been more effective than expected, complemented by expansionary monetary policy settings. After contracting by 2.5% in 2020, Treasury now expects the economy to grow by 5.25% in 2021. On the jobkeeper wage subsidy, Kennedy predicted in March that between 100,000 to 150,000 people could lose their job as a result of the program ending: Early indicators suggest that while there have been some job losses associated with the end of the program, and there may be more in the future, the strength of the broader labour market has meant that many of these individuals are finding jobs. Kennedy said Australian Bureau of Statistics data estimates some 56,000 people have lost their jobs in the four weeks that followed jobkeeper ending. ‚ÄúWe would expect many of those that have lost employment at the end of jobkeeper to regain employment in coming weeks,‚Äù he said. No locally acquired cases in NSW. The foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, says the government considered ‚Äúa number of options‚Äù before deciding to close the embassy in Afghanistan. Payne says the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade had received advice that with the departure of international troops from the country, the risks to the embassy ‚Äúwould significantly increase‚Äù and that ‚Äúmitigations‚Äù would not be able to reduce the risk to an acceptable level. It was a cabinet decision, she confirms. Asked whether the decision was made before or after Payne‚Äôs visit to Kabul on 10 May, the minister says those government discussions were continuing during the time of the trip. The purposes of the visit included enabling discussions with Afghan officials, senior Nato leadership, Australians on the ground and other heads of mission. Penny Wong wants to know whether the closure is really temporary, as the government said in the statement announcing the move last week. Payne says: ‚ÄúIt is a matter of ongoing discussion and engagement between Australia and other missions, other countries, including the US, UK, Nato itself, on the options ahead. I‚Äôve had discussions as recently as last Wednesday with the US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, and those discussions are ongoing.‚Äù Wong says she will be asking a series of question about visa pathways for Afghan nationals who have worked for the Australian government, including local interpreters and staff. The committee chair Eric Abetz says they can be pursued later in the day. You can see some recent Guardian coverage about the concerns for their safety here: We‚Äôre in some bits and bobs detail in the health committee at the moment and now it‚Äôs on a short break until 11.15am. Air Vice Marshal Robert Chipman, head of military strategic clarifies his evidence to Senate estimates. He adds that there were, in fact, discussions between departments about about the future of the embassy in Kabul - that was the purpose of those meetings, he says. He had been talking about his own contribution to the talks about the future of Australia‚Äôs footprint in Afghanistan. Another official, Hugh Jeffrey, says he‚Äôs had discussions with Dfat for ‚Äúover the last year or so‚Äù about the question of keeping the embassy open post-ADF drawdown. Here is that latest ‚Äòwho is responsible‚Äô exchange: The chief of the defence force, Angus Campbell, tells Senate estimates the plans to withdraw Australian forces from Afghanistan by September are consistent with last year‚Äôs defence update, prioritising a focus on the Indo-Pacific region: The coalition drawdown is progressing smoothly. Campbell says the history of Australia‚Äôs longest war ‚Äúwill be painted in different hues‚Äù and ‚Äúwill be coloured, in part‚Äù by the Brereton inquiry and the work of the office of the special investigator. He says he hopes that work ‚Äúwill be understood from the perspective of a larger canvass‚Äù. He wants the record to document the work of the ADF and partner agencies over 20 years, and that the national memory ‚Äúnever forgets what our men and women have accomplished‚Äù. Asked about the current security situation, Campbell says the drawdown decisions were based on an assessment that ‚Äúthis was not going to be a conflict that was going to be resolved militarily‚Äù and that a negotiation involving the Taliban ‚Äúwould be necessary to see peace return to that country‚Äù: The Afghan defence and security forces and the Taliban remain in conflict and that conflict sees violence broadly through the country but particularly with regard to the southern and eastern provinces of the country, a traditional stronghold of the Taliban and its partner organisations ‚Ä¶ We see a continuing level of violence in the country ... This is very much going be a negotiated settlement. Penny Wong raises the closure of the Australian embassy, and asks whether there has been consideration of whether an embassy presence could continue. Air Vice Marshal Robert Chipman, head of military strategic commitments, says he was involved in interdepartmental discussions in the weeks leading up to the government‚Äôs announcement to withdraw from Afghanistan. Asked if the interdepartmental committee addressed whether the embassy in Kabul could remain open, Chipman replies: ‚ÄúNot specifically that I was involved in, senator.‚Äù Richard Colbeck, unable to answer, or unwilling to say the words, is still faffing about in his answer to the question: ‚Äòwho is responsible for vaccinating aged care workers‚Äô. Aged care is a federal responsibility. Vaccination is the responsibility of the federal government. Apparently, vaccinating aged care workers though, is not the responsibility of the federal government. There are a lot of back and forths, including Colbeck telling Gallagher he feels ‚Äúsorry for her‚Äù. Gallagher: ‚ÄúAre you responsible, yes or no?‚Äù Colbeck: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a yes or no answer.‚Äù Eventually, the answer is its being carried out between the states and federal governments. This has been an ongoing frustration for Mike Bowers and the visual reporters ‚Äì some committees are throwing their weight around about where photographers and camera operators can stand to do their jobs ‚Äì which means a lot of photos of the back of people‚Äôs heads. Katy Gallagher asks Richard Colbeck who is responsible for vaccinating aged care staff. Three minutes later, Colbeck says it is a ‚Äúcombined‚Äù program. The first submarine in the government‚Äôs $90bn submarine program must be built in Australia, according to Ronald Finlay of the naval shipbuilding expert advisory panel. Labor‚Äôs Senate leader, Penny Wong, has been grilling officials about the provisions in the strategic partnering agreement between Australia and France‚Äôs Naval Group, which the government has said requires the company to ‚Äúspend at least 60% of the contract value in Australia over the life of the program‚Äù. Wong wants to know if this means the first boat could be made in France, not Australia. Finlay says there would be risks to the shipbuilder if they changed suppliers from ship 1 to ship 2, so the target would be getting into Australian contact as soon as possible to reduce risks. Finlay then makes a more definitive statement: The first ship will be built in Australia ‚Ä¶ There is a requirement for ship 1 to be built in Australia. What about the hull? Greg Moriarty, the defence department secretary, says: ‚ÄúWe are seeking to build as much of the hull in Australia as we can.‚Äù Moriarty adds a caveat on a particular part of the hull: The government‚Äôs clear intent is, if it is technically feasible, we will build it in Australia. If it‚Äôs not we will seek technical advice on where that hull part is best made. Nine Entertainment has told the stock exchange its multimillion-dollar deals with Google and Facebook under the government‚Äôs news media bargaining code have been signed. Along with other changes in the business including subscription revenue, Nine expects growth in the publishing division to be between $30m and $40m over the 2021-22 financial year. Nine said: The deal with Facebook is for the supply of news video clips and access to digital news articles on Facebook news products, for a term of up to 3 years with a minimum amount payable over the term. The 5-year agreement with Google includes the supply of news content (excluding video) for Google‚Äôs News Showcase and other news products. Google will also expand its marketing initiatives across Nine‚Äôs platforms. The amount payable is a fixed annual fee with modest growth in the early years. Katy Gallagher is asking when the decision was made to prioritise residents over staff, and when people were told about that. Richard Colbeck doesn‚Äôt really have an answer. He says aged care staff are still considered part of 1a. Gallagher says it was never made public. Colbeck disputes that it was never made public, because he spoke to the sector about it. Other words used here is that prioritising residents, didn‚Äôt mean that staff were not a priority. (But if you prioritise one group, it stands to reason that there is a shuffling in priorities.) A health official says it wasn‚Äôt a prioritising issue, it was a ‚Äúpivot‚Äù. And the department pivoted a part of its policy (providing in-reach service vaccinations to residents, something which is not available to aged care workers, unless there are doses left over) which meant aged care residents were prioritised over aged care workers, except it wasn‚Äôt an issue of prioritising one group over another, it was a pivot. And it wasn‚Äôt announced, but it was made public. That clear? Richard Colbeck says the decision was made to vaccinate residents before staff, because authorities still don‚Äôt know if the vaccine protects against transmission of the virus. So when the advice came down not to vaccinate staff and residents at the same time, the decision was made to prioritise residents. He says that meant the rollout was ‚Äúrecalibrated‚Äù. But he still can‚Äôt say how many aged care workers have been vaccinated. Labor senator Murray Watt asks Richard Colbeck if he is actually ‚Äúcomfortable‚Äù with the aged care vaccine rollout. Colbeck says Watt is verballing him. Colbeck has said at least twice now, including this morning on ABC RN he is ‚Äúcomfortable‚Äù with the vaccine rollout in aged care centres. The two have a back and forth, which ends with Colbeck saying he stands by what he has said in the media. Back in defence estimates, the Labor senator Kimberley Kitching says AusTender contract notices indicate the government will spend $5.45m over three years on remuneration for members of the naval shipbuilding expert advisory panel. Kitching says that works out to be about $1.8m a year, shared among six members. She suggests this is a higher rate than the former naval shipbuilding advisory board members received. Officials caution that there is a daily rate, so it will depend on work performed. Officials also suggest the estimates include international flights and hotels but they are not spending anything near that rate, due to the Covid-induced move to virtual meetings. The defence department has committed to clarify the details later in the day. Richard Colbeck: Well, senator, one important point is the issue in respect of transmission of the virus with vaccine, which goes back to the point that we were discussing earlier about compulsory vaccination ... Katy Gallagher: I‚Äôm not talking about that, it‚Äôs a red herring. Colbeck: It‚Äôs not a red herring, it‚Äôs actually important ... Gallagher: It actually is ‚Äì you‚Äôre using it to focus away from the fact that you have been unable to roll out a vaccination program for residents or staff in aged care. Colbeck: You can get your Facebook moment, that‚Äôs fine. Richard Colbeck still can‚Äôt say how many Victorian aged care staff in centres under federal jurisdiction have been vaccinated. They just don‚Äôt have the data. They haven‚Äôt been collating it. Liberal senator Dean Smith tries to dig into Victoria‚Äôs response with Prof Paul Kelly. Kelly says Victorian authorities have done an ‚Äúextraordinary‚Äù job scaling up their testing and response and says he doesn‚Äôt have the detail but he believes authorities are ‚Äúkeeping very close to national benchmarks‚Äù. ‚ÄúBut not meeting them,‚Äù Smith says. Kelly says he doesn‚Äôt have the most recent data, but he thinks it would be close, and says authorities are under intense pressure. He takes it on notice. Just to recap what we have learnt so far in health estimates: Health officials came without the information of how many aged care residents have been vaccinated. No one can say how many aged care workers have been vaccinated. Until recently, operators only needed to voluntarily report their workforce vaccination numbers. There is no federal vaccine rollout for aged care workers. They can receive a dose if there is extra from the residential rollout, or work it out themselves. The federal government is now asking for providers to tell them how many aged care workers have been vaccinated in their facilities. There may be a survey to find out. Over in Treasury estimates: Over at the Senate estimates into defence, the $90bn submarine program is in the spotlight. A cabinet subcommittee, the naval shipbuilding enterprise governance committee, has met twice since its creation last November. The Labor senator Kimberley Kitching has asked members of the naval shipbuilding expert advisory panel whether they have made recommendations or provided advice to cancel the future submarine program on risk grounds. Chair of the panel, US-based Vice Admiral William Hilarides, said any advice ‚Äúprovided directly to ministers to support cabinet deliberations‚Äù would be confidential, together with any recommendations. The focus moves on to a capacity enhancement review. The Australian Financial Review reported on 1 May that ‚Äúa major review into Australia‚Äôs submarine warfare capability is likely to recommend bringing forward upgrades for the navy‚Äôs frigates and Collins class submarines‚Äù. Was the naval shipbuilding expert advisory panel made aware of the capacity enhancement review? Hilarides: I think we became aware when we read it in the newspaper. Rightwing thinktank Libertyworks has lost its federal court challenge to Australia‚Äôs outbound travel ban. On Tuesday the full federal court unanimously rejected Libertyworks‚Äô bid to overturn the Covid-19 restriction, which had argued that the health minister Greg Hunt has no power to impose a blanket rule stopping citizens from leaving the country. Justices Anna Katzmann, Michael Wigney and Thomas Thawley dismissed the application and ordered Libertyworks to pay the commonwealth‚Äôs costs. The federal government had argued that, if successful, the case would have ‚Äúdriven a truck‚Äù through Hunt‚Äôs powers under the Biosecurity Act to impose measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19 during the global pandemic. The case is the fourth failed challenge to Australia‚Äôs coronavirus restrictions, after Clive Palmer‚Äôs failure to overturn Western Australia‚Äôs travel ban, a high court decision upholding the validity of Victoria‚Äôs second wave lockdown, and the federal court rejecting a bid to overturn the travel ban from India. Despite the ban, more than 140,000 Australian citizens and permanent residents have left Australia since the start of the pandemic under a regime of exemptions administered by Australian Border Force. Rachel Siewert asks Richard Colbeck whether he has heard reports that aged care workers are being asked by some providers (their bosses) to get vaccinated on their day off. Colbeck has not heard that. Greens senator Rachel Siewert can‚Äôt understand why the government doesn‚Äôt know how many aged care workers have been vaccinated. Richard Colbeck says they are asking providers for that information now, after a previous system of ‚Äúvoluntary reporting‚Äù. Siewert is trying to understand why it wasn‚Äôt made mandatory in the first place. Colbeck says they are doing that now. But until very recently, it was voluntary. And the government can‚Äôt say how many aged care workers have received either a first or second vaccination. So based on the figures the health department has just issued, 44,333 aged care residents in Victoria have received a vaccination. Of those, 25,319 have received their second dose. It‚Äôs 1 June. This was meant to be done by Easter, at the latest. But officials can‚Äôt give a breakdown of how many aged care workers have received their vaccinations. The information has come back ‚Äì just over half the number of residents in aged care facilities in Victoria have received their second dose. Victorian health officials have confirmed with the federal government officials there are NO new aged care cases in the new test results. Prof Brendan Murphy, when asked how many aged care workers have received the vaccination, says it‚Äôs important to note that all Victorian aged care facilities have been visited for a first dose but people can‚Äôt be forced to have the vaccination. Katy Gallagher gets cranky: I‚Äôm not talking about forcing people. This is a new line from the government that seems to be coming out from last week, that it‚Äôs this kind of conscientious objecting that‚Äôs going on as a way of making it look like you‚Äôre not responsible. Richard Colbeck jumps in and argues about ‚Äúemotive statements‚Äù. Gallagher says if he wants to go back to emotive statements, she could ask him if he remembers how many people died in aged care outbreaks during Victoria‚Äôs second wave. (That‚Äôs because Colbeck couldn‚Äôt remember when he was asked.) Across the country, 153,641 aged care residents have received a first dose of the vaccination. Richard Colbeck says that is out of 183,000 residents. That is across the country. No one can say what the state breakdown is, as yet. They are going to try to get the information. Katy Gallagher asks how many aged care residents are waiting for their second dose. A health department deputy secretary says in Victoria, of 596 residential aged care facilities, 382 have had a second dose ‚Äúvisit‚Äù ‚Äì but that doesn‚Äôt mean all residents have had their second dose. The health department DOES NOT have the numbers of how many aged care residents have had two vaccinations. Instead, officials says says 85% residents have consented. 77,134 doses have been administered across aged care and disability ‚Äì but we don‚Äôt know how many people that relates to, and whether they are in aged care or disability care facilities. The aged care minister says a second resident who returned an ‚Äúindeterminate‚Äù test result for Covid has since returned a negative test. His understanding is there are two aged care workers who have tested positive, and one resident. The resident is in hospital as a precaution. Richard Colbeck says aged care providers are required to report to the commonwealth when there is a new Covid case in an aged care centre. He says he hasn‚Äôt received any reports, so he doesn‚Äôt believe any of the new Victorian cases today are linked to aged care. Over in community affairs estimates, it is all about health and aged care. Katy Gallagher asks Prof Brendan Murphy how many cases are in the latest Victorian outbreak. Murphy says he doesn‚Äôt have an updated figure ‚Äì the Victorian authorities don‚Äôt give the information to the feds until they have tweeted it out. Murphy says after the second wave, Victoria decided not to share the information with the federal authorities until it had released the information themselves. Richard Colbeck is told the tweet has gone out. He says he hasn‚Äôt seen it as yet and his office hasn‚Äôt given him any information. These numbers are absolutely incredible: 20,484 vaccine doses were administered and 42,699 test results were received. Again, thank you, Melbourne and Victoria. None of this must be easy. But you keep turning up. This includes the six we learnt about yesterday, so it is three new cases (but nine in the last 24 hours). The latest estimates hearings will begin very, very soon. In community affairs, it‚Äôs all about health this morning ‚Äì and aged care minister Richard Colbeck will be appearing. In the economics committee, Treasury secretary Dr Steven Kennedy will answer questions between 9am and 11am. There is still no answer when it comes to financial support for people who have lost a week‚Äôs pay in the latest Victorian lockdown. It‚Äôs the first lockdown without jobkeeper. So far, the federal government has not budged when it comes to offering any financial support for workers. Instead, Josh Frydenberg said the situation is being ‚Äúmonitored‚Äù. Once again though, Richard Colbeck can not say how many aged care workers have been vaccinated. Because until very recently, the federal government was not collating that data. It is now relying on individual providers to give them that information. Aged care minister Richard Colbeck has been doing the rounds this morning. Here he was on the Seven Network‚Äôs Sunrise program this morning ‚Äì where he had the same lack of answers. On the single site arrangements for aged care workers in the federal system Colbeck said: The arrangements for single worker, single site were arrangements we are negotiated with the Victorian government so they didn‚Äôt have to put in place public-health borders to ban that, so we could maintain flexibility and workforce flows during the outbreak, last year. Some other states put in place public-health orders. Q: Why did you overturn that in November? Colbeck: A couple of reasons; one, it‚Äôs not legal to limit somebody around their working circumstances, in fact the Health Services Union took Huntington‚Äôs aged care in New South Wales to the Fair Work Commission last year to stop them from implementing one worker, one site, and they were successful. Q: OK, but you were paying extra, to combat that and you stopped those payments. Colbeck: That‚Äôs correct, so we put the arrangement in place, in circumstances where there was community transmission and a declared hotspot, that declaration has been made four times in Victoria, twice in Queensland, and once in New South Wales so that when there is community transmission, aged care providers can limit the number of workers who are working in more than one site. Q: But why would have you kept it going until every aged care facility was fully vaccinated? Colbeck: Because the health advice we had was to put it in place while there was a hotspot, and that‚Äôs what we‚Äôve done. Q: You didn‚Äôt think it would come back? You didn‚Äôt think aged care facilities would be vulnerable again? Particularly coming into winter? Colbeck: Well, there is always the risk when there is community transmission, with Covid-19 in aged care, that‚Äôs the facts, that‚Äôs what the statistics showed us, and that‚Äôs why when there is a hotspot declared, it‚Äôs automatically triggered, and triggered the one worker, one site process. So as soon as there is a hotspot triggered by the health authorities, the provisions are triggered by the process. So once Covid has spread far enough for there to be a hotspot declaration THAT‚ÄôS when the one worker, one site process for aged care. But only once it has spread. The shadow aged care minister, Clare O‚ÄôNeil was a guest on 7.30 last night, where she also laid out issues with the federal government‚Äôs aged care response: Frankly, things that should have been done a year ago, when it became clear what a toxic combination it was to get aged care homes together with Covid. Some of the things I‚Äôd just point to - the Federal Government promised us that by March every single aged care resident and every single aged care worker would be fully vaccinated. They have not met that target by any stretch of the imagination. So, there‚Äôs obviously a huge urgency here to vaccinate residents. The thing that has been completely stuffed up though is the vaccination of aged care workers. The Government initially gave us this commitment that aged care workers would be vaccinated. They didn‚Äôt deliver on it and, in fact, have left aged care workers on their own to manage their own vaccinations and, as a consequence, very few have been vaccinated. So, I think we need to be looking there. And, of course, we‚Äôve got this ridiculous situation where, still today, aged care workers in Victoria are working across multiple sites. That is because endemic issues face the workforce in aged care where a lot of people just have to work multiple sites to make ends meet. Sally McManus has some thoughts on what has gone wrong with the aged care response: Richard Colbeck says the ‚Äúsingle site‚Äù staff order is sent out when an area is declared a hotspot. But it seems that when that hotspot declaration is lifted, so too is the order (and funding), which means staff go back to working across multiple aged care homes. I say ‚Äúseems‚Äù because Colbeck doesn‚Äôt give a straight answer. Fran Kelly asks Richard Colbeck where the ‚Äúsense of urgency‚Äù is. He says they are following the advice. Richard Colbeck is speaking to ABC RN this morning. He‚Äôs the aged care minister. And he‚Äôs still ‚Äúcomfortable‚Äù with the vaccine rollout. But he can‚Äôt tell you how many aged care workers have been vaccinated. Because there is no one collating that information. They have now asked for providers to give that information so they can‚Äôt try to work it out. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to give you a number I am not certain of,‚Äù he says. Also, there is no real program to vaccinate aged care workers run by the federal government. The edict is to vaccinate staff where there are leftover vaccines once residents have been vaccinated. Beyond that, providers can set up a program themselves, or aged care workers can see their GP or attend a hub ‚Äì work it out for themselves, in other words. Colbeck says that was to cut down on confusion so there weren‚Äôt mixed vaccines. Christopher Knaus and Melissa Davey have taken a look at what‚Äôs happened with the federal government‚Äôs aged care response ‚Äì and it doesn‚Äôt seem good. At any level. Welcome back to Politics Live. Parliament ‚Äì and estimates ‚Äì are back for the first time this week, but it‚Äôs the events of yesterday‚Äôs non-sitting day which still has everyone‚Äôs focus. The federal government is scrambling to explain how aged care is once experiencing a Covid outbreak, given everything the sector and the people in its care went through last year. Victoria‚Äôs Covid outbreak has shown the vulnerabilities in the federally funded and regulated aged care homes once again: while staff in state-run facilities cannot work at other sites, staff at private facilities ‚Äì which are under the federal government‚Äôs jurisdiction ‚Äì are still able to. That‚Äôs become an issue in this outbreak ‚Äì again ‚Äì after a staff member caught Covid from a colleague at one centre and then worked at another centre. So far the federal government have been unable to give a reason for it, other than there are not enough staff. Greg Hunt said yesterday the states could stop it through a public health order, but that would mean workers ‚Äì who are working multiple sites to make a liveable wage ‚Äì would be forced to lose pay. Policy and pay settings have changed in the state-run facilities. That hasn‚Äôt happened federally, despite the recommendations of the royal commission. We‚Äôll keep you updated on that, and everything else happening in Victoria. There are fears the lockdown could be extended beyond the end of this week ‚Äì authorities did not sound confident yesterday they had it under control. There are more than 270 exposure sites and 4,000 people considered primary or secondary contacts. Each day has seen a stubborn four to five new cases ‚Äì which have mostly been linked ‚Äì but the sheer numbers point to an extension of the lockdown being likely. I‚Äôm so sorry. We‚Äôll bring you all you need to know as soon as we can. We‚Äôll also let you know what‚Äôs happening in parliament and the estimates hearings ‚Äì Mike Bowers is with you as always, along with Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin, Paul Karp and Daniel Hurst. It being a sitting day, you have Amy Remeikis with you for most of the day. I‚Äôm on to just my second coffee ‚Äì but a third is absolutely calling me. Ready?

At least one of the officers hired has a history of supporting GOP claims.

Nonetheless, the conservative activists behind the effort ‚Äì many of whom have little election experience ‚Äì have championed the reviews as an attempt to assuage concerns the 2020 election was stolen.

Continuing to review elections, especially after a result has been finalized, will allow conspiracy theories to fester and undercut the authority of legitimately elected officials, they say. Once election results are certified by state officials, they have long been considered final and it is unprecedented to continue to probe results months after an official is sworn in.

Even though the experienced auditors have found no evidence of wrongdoing, activists have continued to float baseless theories of wrongdoing in a Telegram channel following audits.</p> <p>‚ÄúNothing today is showing evidence of fraud. Nothing today is showing evidence of digital manipulation of the machines,‚Äù Harri Hursti, an election expert and one of the auditors, said this week,<a href=\"https://www.wmur.com/article/windham-new-hampshire-election-audit-update-may-27-2021/36556950\"> according to WMUR</a>. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs amazing how much disinformation and dishonest reporting has been spreading.‚Äù</p> <p>Activists are also pressuring officials in Cheboygan county, Michigan to let an attorney <a href=\"https://www.record-eagle.com/news/lawyer-offers-to-examine-cheboygan-election-results/article_f93c46a6-bd82-11eb-b2cd-33bd59bd9068.html\">affiliated with</a> Sidney Powell, a Trump ally who brought baseless lawsuits after the election, conduct an audit of election equipment.

This is about an effort, as has been proved time and time again by the actions of these individuals, in Arizona and elsewhere, this is an effort to actually spread falsehoods and misinformation under the guise of transparency.‚Äù</p> <p>San Luis Obispo county in the central coast of California has been another target for calls for an audit.

Encouraged by an ongoing haphazard review of 2.1m ballots in Arizona, activists are pushing to review votes or voting equipment in California, Georgia, Michigan, and New Hampshire. Meanwhile, in Wisconsin, the powerful speaker of the state house of representatives recently hired ex-law enforcement officers, including one with a history of supporting Republicans, to spend the next three months investigating claims of fraud. At least one of the officers hired has a history of supporting GOP claims. The announcement also came after state officials announced they found just 27 cases of potential fraud in 2020 out of 3.3m votes cast. The reviews are not going to change the 2020 election results or find widespread fraud, which is exceedingly rare. Nonetheless, the conservative activists behind the effort ‚Äì many of whom have little election experience ‚Äì have championed the reviews as an attempt to assuage concerns the 2020 election was stolen. If the probes don‚Äôt turn up anything, they will only serve to increase confidence in elections, proponents say. But experts see something much more dangerous happening. Continuing to review elections, especially after a result has been finalized, will allow conspiracy theories to fester and undercut the authority of legitimately elected officials, they say. Once election results are certified by state officials, they have long been considered final and it is unprecedented to continue to probe results months after an official is sworn in. It‚Äôs an issue that gets at the heart of America‚Äôs electoral system ‚Äì if Americans no longer have faith their officials are legitimately elected, they worry, the country is heading down an extremely dangerous path. ‚ÄúIt is either a witting or unwitting effort to handcuff democratic self-governance,‚Äù said David Becker, the executive director of the Center for Election Research. The efforts also come at the same moment that Republican legislatures around the country are pushing new restrictions to restrict voting access. Unable to point to evidence of significant fraud, Republican lawmakers have frequently said that new restrictions are needed to restore confidence in elections. In New Hampshire, activists have tried to co-opt an audit in the 15,000 person town of Windham to try and resolve a legitimate discrepancy in vote totals for a state representative race. They unsuccessfully tried to pressure officials there to drop experienced auditors in favor of Jovan Pulitzer, a conspiracy theorist reportedly involved in the Arizona recount who has become a kind of celebrity among those who believe the election was stolen. Even though the experienced auditors have found no evidence of wrongdoing, activists have continued to float baseless theories of wrongdoing in a Telegram channel following audits. ‚ÄúNothing today is showing evidence of fraud. Nothing today is showing evidence of digital manipulation of the machines,‚Äù Harri Hursti, an election expert and one of the auditors, said this week, according to WMUR. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs amazing how much disinformation and dishonest reporting has been spreading.‚Äù Activists are also pressuring officials in Cheboygan county, Michigan to let an attorney affiliated with Sidney Powell, a Trump ally who brought baseless lawsuits after the election, conduct an audit of election equipment. The chair of the board of commissioners told the Detroit News he could not recall a more contentious issue debated before the board in more than two decades. The Michigan efforts prompted a letter from the state‚Äôs top election official, who warned the clerks in Cheboygan and Antrim county ‚Äì another hotbed of conspiracy theories ‚Äì that boards didn‚Äôt have authority to order audits and not to turn over election equipment to unaccredited outside firms, the Washington Post reported. Michigan conducted more than 250 audits after the 2020 race that affirmed the results. Dominion voting systems, which sold equipment to the state, also warned that counties may not be able to use machines in future elections if they turned them over to uncertified auditors. ‚ÄúWe have every reason to want transparency,‚Äù Jocelyn Benson, the state‚Äôs top election official, said in an interview. ‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs not what this is. This is about an effort, as has been proved time and time again by the actions of these individuals, in Arizona and elsewhere, this is an effort to actually spread falsehoods and misinformation under the guise of transparency.‚Äù San Luis Obispo county in the central coast of California has been another target for calls for an audit. During a meeting earlier this month, officials played hours of recorded messages calling for an audit, including one asking whether Tommy Gong, the county‚Äôs clerk and recorder, was a member of the communist party. Activists are also targeting Fulton county, Georgia, another place that was at the center of Trump‚Äôs baseless election attacks last year. Earlier in May, a local judge said that an group led by Garland Favorito, who has reportedly pushed conspiracy theories about 9/11 and the JFK assassination, could inspect absentee ballots, though in a key break from the Arizona review, the judge made it clear that the actual ballots would have to remain in county officials‚Äô custody. Georgia has already manually recounted all of the ballots in the state, which confirmed Joe Biden‚Äôs win over Trump last year. Even in Arizona, the crown jewel of the audit movement, activists may have plans to do even more auditing after the current review of 2.1m ballots wraps up. Republicans are finalizing a plan to use untested software to analyze images of ballots, the Arizona Republic reported Friday. ‚ÄúRarely do the losers believe the they have lost, but historically those who fell short graciously concede once all legal channels are exhausted,‚Äù said Tammy Patrick, a former election official in Maricopa county who now serves as a senior adviser at the Democracy Fund. ‚ÄúThe proliferation of these actions undermine and erode the very foundation of election integrity and our adversaries need only sit back and watch as we chip away at our democratic norms.

Organisers from the Land Stewardship Project ‚Äì a sustainable agriculture nonprofit ‚Äì expected 50 people to attend, but 130 showed up from all corners of the state. Dr Richard Levins, professor emeritus of applied economics at the University of Minnesota, addressed the event, which served as part elegy for the thousands of small family-owned dairies lost in recent years and part rallying cry for those remaining, despite the odds. Across the US, dairy farmers have struggled beneath the weight of an industry-wide economic crisis. The cause is the massive overproduction of milk by large dairy operations, which has saturated the market, driving prices down well below the cost of production. Proponents of mega-dairies cite efficiency and economies of scale, arguing that the model is simply the next logical step in dairying. But opponents, including Levins, say such operations do incalculable damage to the environment and rural communities, and capture bigger slices of a finite milk and cheese market ‚Äì to the detriment of smaller dairies barely hanging on. ‚ÄúUnfortunately, the ‚Äòthere‚Äôs room for everybody‚Äô argument doesn‚Äôt work so well in dairy. It‚Äôs a matter of simple mathematics,‚Äù Levins told the meeting. Bringing in a 5,000-cow dairy doesn‚Äôt increase the demand for milk, he said ‚Äì it simply replaces 50- to 100-cow dairies. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre playing musical chairs.‚Äù Rise of a mega-dairy Dairy conglomerate Riverview LLP is by far the largest mega-dairy operation in the state. At the company‚Äôs flagship dairy in Morris, Minnesota, 10,000 cows wait expectantly for the feed truck. In the ‚Äúnursery‚Äù, a still-wet calf, its umbilical cord dangling, struggles against a worker who tilts back the small head and inserts a tube of colostrum all the way to its stomach. At one day old, calves are strapped into vests, machine-lifted into a truck and transported 10 miles away to the company‚Äôs calf facility. A few days later, they are trucked more than 1,000 miles, either to New Mexico (if bound for the beef market) or Arizona (if destined for dairy) ‚Äì a move that Riverview says is for the warmer weather. Riverview‚Äôs origins lie with the Fehr family, who began a crop and beef farm in 1939. In 1995, seeing an opportunity in dairy, they established their first 800-cow dairy and incorporated as Riverview LLP, a status allowing for multiple owner-investors. One of those investors was the Wulf family, who attended the same church and owned a beef cattle operation. In 2012, Riverview officially merged with Wulf Cattle. Today, Riverview operates three linked but separate segments ‚Äì dairy, beef and crop ‚Äì with at least 25 facilities across five states: Minnesota, South Dakota, Nebraska, New Mexico and Arizona. In Minnesota, the Morris dairy alone produces enough milk every day to fill six 32.5-ton (29.5-tonne) tanker trucks. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre really bullish with the market,‚Äù says Natasha Mortenson, who works in community outreach and education for Riverview. Modern US agriculture is hugely influenced by the vision of Earl Butz, secretary of agriculture under Presidents Nixon and Ford, who championed corporate farming, encouraging farmers to plant ‚Äúfencerow to fencerow‚Äù and ‚Äúget big or get out‚Äù. Donald Trump‚Äôs secretary of agriculture, Sonny Perdue, echoed these sentiments at the 2019 World Dairy Expo in Madison, Wisconsin ‚Äì a state that lost 10% (more than 800) of its dairy farms that year. ‚ÄúThe big get bigger and small go out,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very difficult on economies of scale with the capital needs and all the environmental regulations, and everything else today, to survive milking 40, 50, 60 or even 100 cows.‚Äù Despite a 55% nationwide decrease in dairy farms between 2002 and 2019, cow numbers have held steady and fluid milk volume has increased ‚Äì a fact that illustrates a trend toward fewer farms operating on much larger scales. Between 2012 and 2017, Minnesota lost 1,100 dairy farms. In contrast, those years marked enormous growth for Riverview as it built three new Minnesota mega-dairies, a feedlot in South Dakota and expanded its calf and dairy operations to New Mexico and Arizona. A similar strategy to capture the market was seen in the hog and poultry industries: buy out the smaller farmers at rock-bottom prices, lock in contracts with processors (or acquire your own processing facility), and then seal the doors so no one can get back in when the market rebounds. Mortenson says Riverview only builds dairies where invited by the community, and, in Minnesota, when cheese processors have an ongoing need for more milk. ‚ÄúWe sit at kitchen tables at every single neighbour‚Äôs house,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúDoes that mean that every single neighbour loves us? No, it does not mean that. But that‚Äôs life.‚Äù Unanswered questions One of those potential neighbours, a crop farmer in Dumont, Minnesota, says a Riverview official visited him in April 2019 and shared a plan to build a 24,000-cow dairy a mile away. The official offered to buy the farmer‚Äôs corn for feed, and to sell manure to him as fertiliser. The offer was declined. ‚ÄúI said, I‚Äôm not very interested in that because you‚Äôre not paying enough for the product, and you‚Äôre charging too much for the manure.‚Äù The farmer ‚Äì who asked to remain anonymous ‚Äì was also horrified by the idea of so many cows so close to his home. He worried about odour and air quality, wear and tear on the roads, manure leaching into streams and rivers, and the demand on the groundwater supply. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm telling you, it‚Äôs scary they‚Äôre going to come in here and suck that much water from the ground,‚Äù he says. The 24,000-cow dairy has not been built but, according to state records, the company has applied for a permit to build a 10,500-cow dairy approximately 130 miles north in Waukon Township. Additionally, an application for another 10,500-cow dairy, in Grace Township, is under review. ‚ÄúThey never seem to stop,‚Äù the farmer says. The farmer‚Äôs concerns echo those of community members in Chokio, Minnesota, who organised a campaign in 2014 against Riverview‚Äôs proposed $55m (¬£39m) Baker dairy, which would have housed 9,000 cows if built. In August 2014, the Baker dairy proposal came in front of the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency citizens‚Äô board, which, since 1967, had been responsible for reviewing the environmental impacts of industry proposals and determining whether more thorough regulatory impact studies should be required. Jim Riddle, who served on the citizens‚Äô board for two years, says there were a number of unanswered questions over the Baker dairy proposal. ‚ÄúThe owners of the facility did not have access to sufficient land to spread even half of the manure that would be generated,‚Äù wrote Riddle. ‚ÄúThey did not have data on how their proposed massive water drawdown would impact existing crop and livestock farms in the area. They did not have an agricultural mitigation plan in place for their proposed 12-mile pipeline to carry water from a well that had been permitted seven years earlier for an unbuilt ethanol plant, to the Cafo [confined animal feeding operation].‚Äù The only way to resolve those questions was by compiling a full environmental impact statement (EIS), said Riddle ‚Äì and the board voted unanimously to require one.

In turn, Riddle says, corporate agricultural interests ‚Äì led by the AgriGrowth Council, which presented Riverview LLP with a distinguished service award in 2012 ‚Äì acted swiftly, putting pressure on state legislators to eliminate the citizens‚Äô board. The citizens‚Äô board was abolishedin June 2015. ‚ÄúSo that told me that Riverview has tremendous political influence over both parties,‚Äù says Riddle. Wulf says that while the denial of the Baker permit was the catalyst for the scrapping of the board, Riverview was ‚Äúnot involved in that pressure or in that process‚Äù. ‚ÄòWe need family. We need community‚Äô Jim Van Der Pol, 73, grew up on the family farm in Kerkhoven, Minnesota, and returned in the 1970s with his wife, LeeAnn. They raised their children there and began their own small farm business, which sells grass-fed beef and pork to restaurants and customers throughout the state. The Van Der Pols used to be surrounded by working family farms, but that has changed. ‚ÄúI sometimes think the right way to say it is that there are ghosts in the land,‚Äù says Jim. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a lot lonelier than it was.‚Äù Yet there are five Riverview operations within 10 miles of the Van Der Pols‚Äô house and another within 15 miles. Approximately two miles away is Riverview‚Äôs Louriston dairy, home to nearly 10,000 cows, which the Star Tribune reports ‚Äúdrink enough water to drain an Olympic-sized swimming pool in just over two days, and produce enough manure to fill one every three days‚Äù.

Some $30m have been raised for the official commemoration, most of which has been invested in a spanking new history center which the commission has called <a href=\"https://www.greenwoodrising.org/\">‚ÄúGreenwood Rising‚Äù</a>.</p> <p>Phil Armstrong, the commission‚Äôs project director, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GreenwoodRising/status/1387075542587949058?s=20\">has promised</a> that the exhibitions contained in the museum will ‚Äúnot whitewash or cover-over, but will tell the truth in all its horrific grittiness‚Äù. Local Black activists are hopeful that the center will add to public understanding about how a once-thriving hub of Black business and innovation was torn down in a whirlwind of racial hatred.</p> <p>But they are critical of several key aspects of the commission‚Äôs work. It‚Äôs not just that most of the millions it raised have gone to attracting outside visitors to the city, with nothing given directly as reparations to the community.</p> <p>The name ‚ÄúGreenwood Rising‚Äù has also provoked a hostile response from some Black Tulsans. ‚ÄúHow is Greenwood rising?‚Äù said Nehemiah Frank, the editor-in-chief of <a href=\"https://theblackwallsttimes.com/\">The Black Wall Street Times</a> whose great-great-grandparents lost their homes and businesses in the massacre.</p> <p>He added: ‚ÄúNothing has changed.

In addition to Bynum, they include the US senator from Oklahoma, James Lankford, who was one of the Republicans in Congress on 6 January who <a href=\"https://www.koco.com/article/lankford-changes-course-withdraws-objection-to-certify-electoral-vote-following-chaos-in-dc/35144783\">objected </a>to Joe Biden‚Äôs electoral college certification in obeisance to Donald Trump‚Äôs big lie that the election was stolen from him.</p> <p>Until two weeks ago, the Republican governor of Oklahoma Kevin Stitt also sat on the commission. He was ousted after he <a href=\"https://www.kjrh.com/news/local-news/gov-stitt-removed-from-the-tulsa-race-massacre-centennial-commission\">signed into law HB 1775</a>, a bill that will curtail the teaching of critical race theory in Oklahoma‚Äôs public schools and colleges.</p> <p><a href=\"http://webserver1.lsb.state.ok.us/cf_pdf/2021-22%20ENR/hB/HB1775%20ENR.PDF\">The bill</a> bans teachers from making any student ‚Äúfeel discomfort, guilt, anguish or any other form of psychological distress on account of his or her race or sex‚Äù. Its passing into law just days before the 100th anniversary of the Tulsa massacre has prompted fears that it could be used to put a chill on learning about America‚Äôs long history of white supremacy, from slavery to lynchings ‚Äì and even the 1921 massacre itself.</p> <p>Regina Goodwin, a native of Greenwood who represents Tulsa in the Oklahoma state legislature and whose great grandparents had their businesses burnt to the ground in 1921, called HB 1775 ‚Äúa horrible bill. You can‚Äôt legislate for ‚Äòdiscomfort‚Äô.

The enticements include ‚Äúan emotional opportunity for learning and reflection‚Äù and a ‚Äúspace for reconciliation‚Ä¶ Tulsa triumphs, and you can be a part of this pilgrimage.‚Äù The advert is a brazen attempt to turn Tulsa‚Äôs grim distinction as the setting of one of the most grotesque mass lynchings in US history into a tourist draw. It is the work of the Tulsa Race Massacre Centennial Commission, a body of prominent state and city politicians and other local notables who have put together the city‚Äôs established version of the 100th anniversary of a very special day. On that day, 31 May 1921, white Tulsans ran amok, shooting any Black person in sight, dropping incendiary devices from the air onto their homes and burning to the ground one of the most flourishing Black business districts in the country, known as ‚ÄúBlack Wall Street‚Äù. Some 35 blocks of Black real estate in the Greenwood neighbourhood were destroyed. At least 300 men, women and children were murdered. Over 24 hours, Tulsa witnessed what is thought to be the worst single event of white supremacist violence against African Americans in the nation‚Äôs history. From the terror of 31 May 1921 to the ‚Äútriumph‚Äù of 31 May 2021 ‚Äì it makes for a powerful attraction for visitors. The only hitch with this depiction of Tulsa rising from the ashes is that from the perspective of the Black survivors and many of the descendants of the massacre, it has no bearing in reality. Tulsa isn‚Äôt leading America‚Äôs journey to racial healing. And it certainly hasn‚Äôt triumphed. Talk to many of the people whose families were directly impacted by the hell-fire unleashed 100 years ago , and they will tell you that the wounds are still open and weeping. ‚ÄúWhen I read that ad, it made me angry,‚Äù said Kristi Williams, whose great aunt was forced to flee Tulsa in 1921 to escape the blood-thirsty horde. ‚ÄúReconciliation? There hasn‚Äôt been any reconciliation. If I told you I was hungry, you would give me food ‚Äì not a picture of some food.‚Äù Damario Solomon-Simmons, a Tulsa civil-rights lawyer who is representing the three known survivors of the race massacre in a reparations lawsuit, responded more bluntly. ‚Äú‚ÄòTulsa triumphs‚Äô is a complete 100% lie. This city is one of the most segregated and discriminatory in America, and that‚Äôs not anecdotal ‚Äì look at the facts.‚Äù The facts do tell a starkly different story from the official account of racial healing. They suggest that the deep injury that was inflicted on Black residents in the 1921 massacre remains untreated, with the consequences clearly reflected in today‚Äôs glaring racial disparities. Human Rights Watch has compiled some of the key data: North Tulsa, where a large proportion of the city‚Äôs Black population lives today, has 34% living in poverty, compared with 13% in the largely-white South Tulsa; Unemployment among Black Tulsans is more than double that of whites; The median income for Black North Tulsa is $29,000, for white South Tulsa $60,000; Life expectancy for Black Tulsans is 70 years, for white Tulsans 81 years. Discontent over the official remembrance came to a head at the weekend. The main event planned by the Centennial Commission, featuring singer John Legend and the Georgia Democrat Stacey Abrams was abruptly cancelled in a disagreement over how much the commission would contribute towards a reparations fund in return for attendance at the event by survivors of the massacre. It is one of the extraordinary elements of the 1921 catastrophe that survivors are still alive. Three individuals are active today who as children experienced the horror of white sadism perpetrated on that day. The oldest of the trio, Mother Viola Fletcher, just turned 107. At a recent event in Tulsa, she walked unassisted to the podium and recalled what happened to her as a seven-year-old girl. ‚ÄúI still remember all the shooting and running,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúPeople being killed. Crawling and seeing smoke. Seeing airplanes flying, and a messenger going through the neighourhood telling all the Black people to leave town.‚Äù Then Fletcher stopped speaking. Even after 100 years, the memories of that day still have the power to overwhelm her. Fletcher is a lead plaintiff, along with her two fellow survivors ‚Äì Lessie Benningfield Randle, 106, and Hughes Van Ellis, 100 ‚Äì in the reparations lawsuit. The suit is being brought under Oklahoma‚Äôs ‚Äúongoing nuisance‚Äù law, and names as defendants the City of Tulsa, the county and other entities that were complicit in the events in 1921 and in the on-going suppression of the Black community that followed. As the debate intensifies nationwide about reparations for African Americans for the harm inflicted through slavery and other racial injustices, the Tulsa lawsuit is being watched closely as one of the most advanced actions being played out in US courts. Solomon-Simmons hopes it will be the vanguard of the reparations movement. ‚ÄúTulsa is the test case,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf we are going to have overall reparations in America, it will have to happen here in Tulsa first.‚Äù One of the remarkable features of the 1921 massacre is that despite the scale and ferocity of the violence ‚Äì in addition to the murders, some 1,200 Black homes were destroyed ‚Äì not one of more than 100 legal cases that were filed in the aftermath have ever had its day in court. Solomon-Simmons‚Äô has made it his mission to break that jinx. ‚ÄúWe believe that this case will be heard and that we will prove what everybody already knows ‚Äì that the racial and economic disparities that exist in Tulsa today are the result of the 1921 massacre. For the first time, we will establish that the Black man has rights that the white man must respect.‚Äù The Republican mayor of Tulsa, GT Bynum, insists that he has put at the forefront of his administration the goals of addressing the legacy of the massacre and investing in community-led redevelopment. Part of that plan is to begin today ‚Äì the day Joe Biden arrives in town to round off the centennial events ‚Äì in the form of a major excavation project in Tulsa‚Äôs Oaklawn cemetery in search for what are thought to be mass graves of 1921 massacre victims. After it has been determined whether the remains are of 1921 victims, Bynum then intends to use DNA testing and genealogical research ‚Äúto bring some healing and justice to the Tulsa community‚Äù, a spokesperson for the mayor‚Äôs office said. As for reparations in the form of cash payments to the survivors, Bynum is dismissive. ‚ÄúMayor Bynum has stated he does not believe this generation of Tulsans should be financially penalized for what criminals did 100 years ago,‚Äù the spokesperson said. The reparations lawsuit hangs awkwardly over the Centennial Commission as it seeks to put a positive spin on present-day Tulsa and how it has ‚Äútriumphed‚Äù over its painful past. Some $30m have been raised for the official commemoration, most of which has been invested in a spanking new history center which the commission has called ‚ÄúGreenwood Rising‚Äù. Phil Armstrong, the commission‚Äôs project director, has promised that the exhibitions contained in the museum will ‚Äúnot whitewash or cover-over, but will tell the truth in all its horrific grittiness‚Äù. Local Black activists are hopeful that the center will add to public understanding about how a once-thriving hub of Black business and innovation was torn down in a whirlwind of racial hatred. But they are critical of several key aspects of the commission‚Äôs work. It‚Äôs not just that most of the millions it raised have gone to attracting outside visitors to the city, with nothing given directly as reparations to the community. The name ‚ÄúGreenwood Rising‚Äù has also provoked a hostile response from some Black Tulsans. ‚ÄúHow is Greenwood rising?‚Äù said Nehemiah Frank, the editor-in-chief of The Black Wall Street Times whose great-great-grandparents lost their homes and businesses in the massacre. He added: ‚ÄúNothing has changed. When you come to Tulsa and walk through the Greenwood district it is completely unrecognizable ‚Äì there is no sign of the greatness that this community was.‚Äù The commission has also been criticized for failing to involve the survivors and descendants of the massacre in conceiving and executing the new museum. ‚ÄúWe have to be careful who‚Äôs telling our history,‚Äù Williams said. She cited an old African proverb: ‚ÄúUntil the lion learns how to tell its own story, the story will always glorify the hunter.‚Äù There are certainly some powerful hunters on the board of the commission ‚Äì among them several of the top Republicans in Oklahoma. In addition to Bynum, they include the US senator from Oklahoma, James Lankford, who was one of the Republicans in Congress on 6 January who objected to Joe Biden‚Äôs electoral college certification in obeisance to Donald Trump‚Äôs big lie that the election was stolen from him. Until two weeks ago, the Republican governor of Oklahoma Kevin Stitt also sat on the commission. He was ousted after he signed into law HB 1775, a bill that will curtail the teaching of critical race theory in Oklahoma‚Äôs public schools and colleges. The bill bans teachers from making any student ‚Äúfeel discomfort, guilt, anguish or any other form of psychological distress on account of his or her race or sex‚Äù. Its passing into law just days before the 100th anniversary of the Tulsa massacre has prompted fears that it could be used to put a chill on learning about America‚Äôs long history of white supremacy, from slavery to lynchings ‚Äì and even the 1921 massacre itself. Regina Goodwin, a native of Greenwood who represents Tulsa in the Oklahoma state legislature and whose great grandparents had their businesses burnt to the ground in 1921, called HB 1775 ‚Äúa horrible bill. You can‚Äôt legislate for ‚Äòdiscomfort‚Äô. Could a parent say that their child is discomforted by a class on the race massacre, of course they could.‚Äù Goodwin also pointed to several other contentious laws passed recently by Oklahoma‚Äôs Republican-controlled legislature. A new law has been pushed through in the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests that grants immunity to drivers who unintentionally injure or kill demonstrators blocking the road. Another bill prohibits people from posting videos and other information that personally identifies police officers. That has prompted concerns that people who film police misconduct on their phones ‚Äì such as the video of Derek Chauvin murdering George Floyd ‚Äì could be subjected to criminal prosecution. ‚ÄúAll of this says Black lives don‚Äôt matter,‚Äù Goodwin told the Guardian. ‚ÄúAs we talk about the centennial of the Tulsa massacre, let‚Äôs remember that Black people are still being massacred. In 1921 people were shot to death and no one was charged, no one convicted. It‚Äôs 2021, and the same thing is happening today.‚Äù","charCount":"11190","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/edpilkington\">Ed Pilkington</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2021/jun/01/samson-kambalu-new-liberia-review-modern-art-oxford-malawi","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-01T06:00:44Z","webTitle":"Samson Kambalu: New Liberia review ‚Äì all hail the elephants of hope","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/jun/01/samson-kambalu-new-liberia-review-modern-art-oxford-malawi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2021/jun/01/samson-kambalu-new-liberia-review-modern-art-oxford-malawi","fields":{"headline":"Samson Kambalu: New Liberia review ‚Äì all hail the elephants of hope","standfirst":"<p><strong>Modern Art Oxford</strong><br>An Oxford don in reverse, sticky situationism and a icon of Malawian independence are among the cultural collisions explored in this Fourth Plinth contender‚Äôs show<br></p>","trailText":"<strong>Modern Art Oxford</strong><br>An Oxford don in reverse, sticky situationism and a icon of Malawian independence are among the cultural collisions explored in this Fourth Plinth contender‚Äôs show<br>","byline":"Adrian Searle","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f98a207020707f64cbd84410ab5d9f04dfc995b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f98a207020707f64cbd84410ab5d9f04dfc995b4/0_248_7125_4275/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Samson Kambalu: New Liberia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Abstractions of a better world ...

With the Delta variant driving the rise in case numbers, she revealed a total of 992 people tested positive for the virus on Thursday, the highest daily figure since 17 February, and that the number of new cases had more than tripled in the past month. Speaking at her regular Covid briefing, Sturgeon said that Scotland was at a “critical juncture” in the pandemic but stressed that the success of the vaccine programme meant ink between the number of cases and the number of people being hospitalised and dying because of the virus was not as strong as it has been previously. The warning comes as It comes as parts of Scotland prepare to move down from level 2 to level 1 of lockdown restrictions from midnight tonight, while Glasgow – which has been under tough lockdown restrictions for eight months – meaning residents will be able to meet in homes in groups of up to six, from a maximum of three households. It also means that indoor licensed hospitality can reopen, and that people can travel again between Glasgow and other parts of the country. Hounslow Council have tweeted to ask that people don’t turn up to Brentford Fountain Leisure Centre today and over the weekend for a vaccine unless they have an appointment. This is in response to a fake story which is being circulated on Whatsapp about mass walk-in vaccination for those over 18. It’s unclear where the incorrect message originated from. The percentage of people testing positive for Covid-19 is estimated to have increased in north-west England, the east Midlands and south-west England. There are also signs of a possible increase in the West Midlands and London while the trend is uncertain for other regions, the ONS said. In many regions positivity rates are very low, meaning trends are difficult to identify since they are affected by small changes in the number of people testing positive from week to week, PA news reports. North-west England had the highest proportion of people of any region in England likely to test positive for coronavirus in the week to 29 May: around one in 280. South-east England had the lowest estimate: around one in 1,490. The decision to move Portugal to the Amber list is going to have a huge knock-on effect to the local economy in southern Portugal, a business owner told the Guardian. Cheryl Smith, who runs Figs on the Funcho, a wedding and retreat business in The Algarve, which was due to welcome guests on Saturday for a week-long painting holiday said she was “devastated” by the news and said the uncertainty of not knowing whether guests will arrive makes planning “difficult and stressful”. She said: Moving from green to amber will further increase the negative economic impact on the Algarve as they are heavily dependent on tourism. Many are dependent on the jobs and services in the tourism sector. During our painting and walking holiday experiences we encourage our visitors to purchase local, handmade or locally produced crafts by visiting nearby villages where we can promote the local heritage, architecture, culture, arts, crafts, tradition and gastronomy of our region. We choose meals at local family owned restaurants and we support local income by employing local guides, art tutors and cleaners from our area. The produce used to prepare meals at Figs on the Funcho are locally sourced as much as possible by shopping at our local village market. Even the honey served at breakfast is purchased from our local beekeepers who also tend to our lovely garden. Olive oil produced in our local area is used in our kitchen. It was very disheartening to receive the travel update two days before the start of our painting holiday as it causes turmoil and stress both for the organisers and holiday makers. However, she was optimistic Portugal will move back to the green list again soon. She said: Portugal is administering vaccines seven days a week to achieve the acceptable level so we are hoping we can receive tourists very soon again. Simon Smith, who is currently in Portugal, said his family had been racing to find Covid tests to get a return flight to the UK on Saturday morning. The property developer from Stamford, Lincolnshire, who owns a villa in the Lagos area, said he had visited five medical centres and the main hospital to try to get his family tested. He told PA Media he was turned away from one centre after it ran out of testing kits. Smith, who is abroad with his wife and two children, aged two and four, said: There were about 35 people in the queue, all British, and they told us, ‘the first 15 are okay, but the rest of you might as well go home because we don’t have enough tests’. There has just been no thought into it at all. I thought with the whole idea of the green list was that they were going to monitor it and give people plenty of time and notice to get flights and sort out problems with testing. He said the change was a “real kick in the teeth”. “It’s really safe here in Portugal,” he added. “On the Algarve, there are very few cases, and all the restaurants and shops take it really seriously.” The family has been told the airport has a small amount of Covid tests available, so plan on turning up to their flight five hours early in the hopes of getting one. He said: If we can’t get that, we can’t fly. And then we are going to be stuck here, and then have to face 10 days’ quarantine. I have meetings on Friday, I can’t afford 10 days’ quarantine, it is a joke. Prof Christina Pagel of University College London points out on Twitter that there has been a “marked increase” in secondary school-age children testing positive for coronavirus. She said: We owe it to kids to keep cases low &amp; protect their education. The latest ONS data on infections has been released and show there has likely been an increase in the percentage of people testing positive for coronavirus in most areas of the UK. In England, the percentage of people testing positive has increased in the week ending 29 May 2021. The ONS estimates 85,600 people within the community population in England had Covid-19, equating to about one in 640 people, which is up from about one in 1,100 last week. This is the highest level since the week to 16 April. In Wales, there are early signs of an increase in the percentage of people testing positive in the week ending 29 May 2021, where the estimate is that 2,900 people in Wales had Covid-19, equating to about one in 1,050 people. In Northern Ireland, the trend in the percentage of people testing positive is uncertain in the week ending 29 May 2021. The ONS estimates that 2,300 people in Northern Ireland had Covid-19, equating to about one in 800 people. In Scotland, the percentage of people testing positive has likely increased in the two weeks up to 29 May 2021, however, the trend is uncertain in the week ending 29 May 2021. The estimate shows that 7,700 people in Scotland had Covid-19, equating to about one in 680 people. In the week ending 29 May 2021, the data analysts have seen an increase in cases in England that are not compatible with the UK variant B.1.1.7 (labelled Alpha by the World Health Organization); these are likely to be the variant B.1.617.2 (known as Delta), first identified in India. In the week ending 29 May 2021, there has been an increase in cases that are compatible with the UK variant B.1.1.7 (WHO “Alpha”) in Wales. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has approved the use of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine in 12- to 15-year-olds. The MHRA said the decision follows a “rigorous review” of safety and effectiveness in that age group. Dr June Raine, MHRA chief executive, said: We have carefully reviewed clinical trial data in children aged 12 to 15 years and have concluded that the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine is safe and effective in this age group and that the benefits of this vaccine outweigh any risk. We have in place a comprehensive safety surveillance strategy for monitoring the safety of all UK-approved Covid-19 vaccines and this surveillance will include the 12- to 15-year age group. No extension to an authorisation would be approved unless the expected standards of safety, quality and effectiveness have been met. It will now be for the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) to advise on whether this age group will be vaccinated as part of the deployment programme. More than 2,000 children were involved in the clinical trial to determine the safety of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, the chair of the Commission on Human Medicines said. Prof Sir Munir Pirmohamed said: We have been very careful to take into consideration the younger age group and the benefits of this population being vaccinated against any potential risk of side-effects. There has been a thorough assessment and review of this data which was also looked at specifically by the CHM’s Paediatric Medicines Expert Advisory Group who are scientific experts within this age group, as well as the CHM’s Covid-19 Vaccines Benefit Risk Expert Working Group. We have concluded that based on the data we have seen on the quality, effectiveness and safety of the vaccine, its benefits do outweigh any risk. The MHRA will continue to scrutinise all of the suspected side-effects data received through the rigorous surveillance programme in place through the Yellow Card scheme and other safety surveillance measures for all of the Covid-19 vaccines used in the UK. Over 2,000 children aged 12-15 years were studied as part of the randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trials. There were no cases of Covid-19 from seven days after the second dose in the vaccinated group, compared with 16 cases in the placebo group. In addition, data on neutralising antibodies showed the vaccine working at the same level as seen in adults aged 16-25 years. These are extremely positive results. Britain’s medicines regulator said on Friday it had extended approval of the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech so it can be used on 12- to 15-year-olds. Dr June Raine, the chief executive of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, said: We have carefully reviewed clinical trial data in children aged 12 to 15 years and have concluded that the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine is safe and effective in this age group and that the benefits of this vaccine outweigh any risk. She added it would be up to the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation to decide whether this age group would come under the vaccine deployment programme. First Minister Mark Drakeford said Wales’s coronavirus restrictions would continue to ease if the growing number of cases of the Indian variant was not leading to increased pressure on hospitals. He told PA Media: It’s not risk-free, that strategy, because that assumes that there will be greater circulation of the virus in the community and when you allow coronavirus to circulate the opportunities for new variants emerging increase as well. But if the link between falling ill and needing to be treated in hospital is broken, then it will mean that in the future we will have to find ways of living with coronavirus more like the way we live with the seasonal flu. Drakeford said part of the reason he was pausing further easing of Wales’s rules for three weeks was due to evidence the variant was causing greater hospital admissions among young people. He said: The considerable majority of those people are people who have not been vaccinated, but amongst their number are people who have received the vaccine. That’s why the advice we have is that two more weeks of evidence really will be very helpful to us in understanding better where this new variant is having its impact. One of the UK’s leading scientists has called on the prime minister to donate 20% of the UK’s Covid vaccines to other countries in an effort to try to save lives and stem the spread of coronavirus variants. The head of the Wellcome Trust, Sir Jeremy Farrar, and the executive director of Unicef UK, Steven Waugh, have published an open letter to Boris Johnson appealing for the UK to set an example ahead of the G7 summit in Cornwall, which begins in a week’s time. UK science played a core part in “breathtaking advances” that have enabled vaccines to be developed, which is the way out of the pandemic, they say in their letter. They write: At home, the UK vaccination rollout has been a phenomenal success and has already saved countless lives. Yet, globally too many countries still lack doses to protect healthcare workers and the most vulnerable. As president of the G7, the UK has the opportunity to set the standard for global action on sharing doses. Three months ago, you proudly pledged that the UK would share vaccines with the world. Now we ask that you turn this pledge into reality. Read the full story here: Prevalence of self-reported long Covid was greatest in people aged 35 to 69 years, females, those living in the most deprived areas, those working in health or social care and those with another activity-limiting health condition or disability, the ONS found. There is no universally agreed definition of long Covid but it covers a broad range of symptoms such as fatigue, muscle pain and difficulty concentrating, PA Media reports. Fatigue (weakness or tiredness) was the most common symptom reported as part of individuals’ experience of long Covid up until 2 May (547,000 out of 1 million people), followed by shortness of breath (405,000), muscle ache (313,000) and difficulty concentrating (285,000). The Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, said he had wanted the UK to wait longer before its original decision to put Portugal on the green list because coronavirus figures showed it was only “marginally” qualified for that status. Drakeford told PA Media: The figures showed that while Portugal was in a position to be put on the green list, it was only marginally so. I would have waited a bit longer to see whether that position was strengthening so that you can be confident that it would be on the green list, or whether because it was so close to the margin things could have moved against it being on the green list. Now things have deteriorated in Portugal and I know that will be a very significant challenge now for people who are already on holiday there to face quarantining when they return. An estimated 1 million people in private households in the UK reported experiencing “long Covid” in the four weeks to 2 May, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Of these people, an estimated 869,000 first had Covid-19 – or suspected they had Covid-19 – at least 12 weeks previously, while 376,000 first had the virus or suspected they had the virus at least one year ago, PA Media reports. Long Covid was estimated to be adversely affecting the day-to-day activities of 650,000 people, with 192,000 reporting that their ability to undertake day-to-day activities had been limited a lot. Cristóvão Norte, Portuguese MP for the Algarve, said he is “perplexed” by the British government’s decision to remove Portugal from the green list. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: We were not expecting the decision because there haven’t been major changes in Portugal, just a spike in the Lisbon area. But we have 66 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. Our rate of transmission is more or less the UK rate, so we weren’t expecting this decision from the English government. We wear masks, we obey the rules, we maintain social distancing, vaccination is growing steadily. So I’m a little bit perplexed. Norte added: I have to respect the decision. We would like to know sooner. This causes great uncertainty. He said it is “a huge blow” on the economy, adding that the country heavily depends on British tourism. Julia Lo Bue-Said, chief executive of travel agent group Advantage Travel Partnership, said the decision in relation to Portugal was “an absolute devastating blow” for consumers and the industry, PA Media reports. She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: It now throws confidence completely out of the window. It puts the industry in a really difficult position and consumers in a difficult position in order to be able to plan effectively. Tim Hawkins, chief strategy officer at Manchester Airports Group, which owns Manchester, Stansted and East Midlands airports, claimed the government “isn’t willing to take any risk at all”, and urged ministers to “trust in the traffic light system”. He told Times Radio: For people coming back from green countries you have to take a pre-departure test, you have to take a test when you come back. There is not a free flow of people coming back from those countries. There are safeguards, there are measures in place to control those kinds of things, but the government seems to have ignored those. Portugal is not the only country that has moved on the traffic light rating system. Afghanistan, Bahrain, Costa Rica, Sudan, and Trinidad and Tobago have also been placed on the red list, meaning people arriving in the UK from those nations must stay in a quarantine hotel for 11 nights. The changes come into effect at 4am on Tuesday. The Delta variant of coronavirus, first discovered in India, is anywhere between 30% to 100% more transmissible than the previously dominant Alpha (or Kent) variant, according to Prof Neil Ferguson, whose Covid modelling was key to the UK’s first lockdown. Ferguson is a leading epidemiologist at Imperial College London who advised the government at the beginning of the pandemic. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “We’re certainly getting more data. Unfortunately, the news is not as positive as I would like in any respect about the Delta variant. The best estimate at the moment is this variant may be 60% more transmissible than the Alpha [Kent] variant. “There’s some uncertainty around that depending on assumption and how you analyse the data, between about 30% and maybe even up to 100% more transmissible.” It comes as the date of lifting lockdown approaches, with 21 June the proposed time when the government will remove “all legal limits on social contact”, although some social distancing and mask-wearing rules will remain. Read the full story here: Here’s a clip of Prof Neil Ferguson talking about the potential easing of restrictions on 21 June. He says the Delta variant may be 60% more transmissible than the variant first identified in Kent and it is doubling across the country “about every nine days”. Robert Jenrick said there was still “nothing at the moment that suggests that we won’t be able to move forward” with the next stage of lifting restrictions on 21 June. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: We’ve got a further 10 days until we are going to make that decision on or around June 14, so during that period we’ll see where are we with hospitalisations, with deaths, where are we with the vaccine rollout – we’re doing everything we possibly can to expedite that – and then at that point, we’ll make our final decision. Asked whether measures such as wearing masks and working from home could continue after 21 June, Jenrick told the Today programme: Well, there are options that are clearly available to the government. We set out within the road map what would be expected to happen at the next stage and we want to try to stick to that if we possibly can. All of us are moving everything we can to achieve that. But of course, we keep these things under review and we’re also asking people to continue to exercise caution in their daily lives. Communities secretary Robert Jenrick insisted a watchlist, where countries at risk of moving from the green to amber list are placed, is still an option. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: The watchlist system remains, if it’s possible to do that. If you’re seeing that cases are gradually rising, that positivity is increasing, then one may be able to use that and if you can, obviously it’s preferable to do so because you want to give people and the industry that forward guidance. But if you’re seeing new variants or versions of variants emerging, you may need to act more swiftly, and I think that is the right thing to do. First minister Mark Drakeford has said he believes Wales is “right to be concerned” about the Delta variant of Covid-19. “It is spreading very quickly in the north-west of England, right on our border,” Drakeford told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. We know it’s more transmissible. There is some evidence that it is driving more people into hospitals. Drakeford said the country’s chief medical officer had advised on Thursday that Wales should “phase in” its move to alert level one over the next three weeks. He said a cluster of cases of the Delta variant in Llandudno was believed to be “under the control” of public health teams in the area but 300 people were self-isolating as a result of it. He said: We’ve had examples in schools and in workplaces in that part of Wales and our caution is grounded in what the science is saying to us about the potential impact of that new variant more widely in Wales. Dame Irene Hays, owner of travel agent Hays Travel, said she was “surprised and obviously disappointed” to hear of Portugal’s move off the green list for travel from the UK. She told Sky News: [I’m] disappointed for our customers, disappointed for the travel industry and really disappointed for Portugal, because they’ve tried so hard and their infection rates are so low. I know they’re rising in Lisbon, but it’s quite a way from the Algarve, which is where most of the tourists are. Asked if she felt that nuance had not been taken into consideration, Hays said: It would be nice if it was a nuanced approach, but we are where we are. It is “difficult” and “very frustrating” for holidaymakers, particularly those who had just started their trips, she added. While some people are still booking holidays for the summer, Hays said the “vast majority” are instead booking for autumn or 2022. Moving Portugal off the UK’s green list is “an overreaction”, an epidemiologist in the popular holiday destination has said. Prof Henrique Barros, the president of Portugal’s National Health Council, said the overall situation in the country is “relatively stable”. The communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, said positive cases had doubled in the last three weeks in Portugal. Barros told Sky News: We didn’t reach such an increase, except as I said in a specific area around Lisbon. The overall picture in the country, we didn’t reach such figures. Asked about Portugal being moved to the amber list for travel, he said: I think it’s an overreaction. But of course you know that people moving from one country to the other, it’s obviously a risk for both countries, of course. We know that we should pay attention to the situation. He said it is mainly people aged under 40 and 30 where a rise in infections is being seen, and that with people over 50 “we have a very, very low incidence of cases”. The health chief said hospital admissions at the present time are “very low”, at less than 25 people per million, while those in intensive care are at less than five people per million. Barros stressed that officials in the country “pay a lot of attention” to monitoring the virus. Robert Jenrick said he did not know how many cases there were of the new Nepal variant of the coronavirus. Speaking to the Today programme, the communities secretary said it appeared to be a “further mutation of the Indian variant”. When asked how the Nepal variant could be used as a reason to remove Portugal from the green list if he did not know how many cases there were, Jenrick said: We have seen that there are cases of it, they are picking this up, and we took the decision that it was better to be cautious whilst we learn about this new mutation of the variant. Jenrick said he was not aware of any cases of the Nepal variant in the UK. He said Portuguese scientists had detected the variant, but said: What we don’t yet know is how prevalent it is in Portugal – but more importantly than that, whether this really is a significant problem. You could, of course, wait whilst we do that research and then, God forbid, we learn that it is very virulent, that it does compromise our vaccines, or we can take a safety-first approach. He was also on BBC Breakfast defending the decision to add Portugal to the amber list, saying “it’s right to be careful”. The communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, said the decision not to move Portugal off the green list until Tuesday meant people could travel home in an “orderly” manner. He told BBC Breakfast: We think it’s sensible to give people a period of time to return home to the UK. As I say, they’ve got until Tuesday to do so, that’s designed to help people to come back in an orderly manner, to not see scenes at airports where people are crowded together. There are risks involved in creating that sort of situation. We have taken a cautious approach by taking Portugal off the green list, putting it back onto the amber list, and I think that’s the right thing to do to protect the public. Prof Neil Ferguson said most people in hospital with the virus have not had a vaccine. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today Programme: It’s important to say that most people being hospitalised at the moment with this variant, and with any Covid variant, are unvaccinated. So, it’s clear that the vaccines are still having a substantial effect, though it may be slightly compromised. He said they are still waiting for data on how much the Delta variant can evade the immunity which protects people against being admitted to hospital. He said: The data being reported relates to unvaccinated people, so if you haven’t been vaccinated there appears to be, both from Public Health England data and from Public Health Scotland data independently, about a twofold increased risk of hospitalisation. Professor Neil Ferguson said he thinks the data is “pointing this week in a more negative direction than it was last week” and that it would be a “very difficult judgment call” when asked about whether the 21 June lifting of restrictions needs to be delayed. The epidemiologist and former government adviser told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: First of all, it’s not my job to make that decision, thankfully. I think the data is pointing this week in a more negative direction than it was last week, so it points towards the direction of being cautious. I think balancing, clearly, people’s desire – and there clearly is a built-up desire to get back to normal – against the potential risk is a very difficult judgment call. Welcome to today’s liveblog.

Zverev holds to love, with no momentum shift in sight for Djere. He takes the first set 6-2. Here is Fognini punching his racquet a little earlier: Fognini, apparently, punched the strings of his racquet and needed a medical timeout, with claret everywhere, in his ongoing match against Delbonis. Now, Zverev is serving for the set. Boom! Djere pounces on a rare short ball from his opponent and crushes a forehand winner to the corner. It’s 5-2. Far too early to suggest that’s a momentum-shifter of a shot, but it will feed the Serbian’s confidence a little. Deuce on Djere’s serve. Zverev engineers a delicate drop shot from the baseline, and Djere can’t get there fast enough to dig it out. Break and set point. Zverev goes for glory with a brave forehand down the line, but it’s just wide, and back to deuce. Zverev goes 5-1 up. Djere capitulated in that game to a certain extent with a couple of sloppy errors. He immediately finds a very good winner to begin his service game, however. With his flowing locks of fair hair, bandana and copious gold jewellery (including a medallion), there is a distinctly 1970s vibe to Zverev’s look. Nothing wrong with that, either. Meanwhile, Djere gathers himself to hold serve to love, which is a foothold in the match, and it’s 4-1. Zverev closes out another comfortable hold with a cleanly-hit ace. It’s 4-0. Zverev breaks again! He’s 3-0 up and playing some accomplished stuff against Djere, the Hungarian who is ranked 55. Meanwhile, Delbonis is two sets to the good against Fognini: 6-4, 6-1, while Nishikori leads Laaksonen 6-5 in the first on Court Simonne Mathieu. Rain stops play on the other courts as it hammers down on the recently closed roof of Philippe-Chatrier. Concerning news: Russian tennis player Yana Sizikova has been arrested in Paris by French police as part of a match fixing investigation. Here is Tumaini Carayol’s story: Zverev forces deuce on Djere’s serve, crafting a rally beautifully from the back of the court, varying the pace and direction of his shots, before ending it with a cross-court forehand pass that loops away from Djere - who can only shake his head and wonder how he is going to live with this quality of hitting from the other side of the net ... Zverev moves 2-0 up by holding his first service game. Then there’s a lovely forehand winner, angled down the line, as a reminder to Djere that merely holding serve isn’t going to be entirely straightforward against a player of Zverev’s calibre. Thanks David. All happening: Zverev breaks Djere at the first time of asking. Meanwhile, the retractable roof above Philippe-Chatrier is being closed to keep the rain out, which has obviously now rolled over Paris, having been soaking the south of England for most of the morning. These players are famously tough, though, and are carrying on regardless as the roof closes above them with not a towel in sight. I’ll hand you back to Luke McLaughlin to bring hot news of the lengthy first game in the Zverev-Djere clash. Big applause now on Philippe-Chatrier as Alexander Zverev, the sixth seed, starts out against Serbia’s Laslo Djere. It’s their first meeting at Roland Garros. Zverev was a quarter-finalist here in both 2018 and 2019 while going out in the fourth round last year. The German made the final of the 2020 US Open but lost a five-set thriller to Dominic Thiem after being two sets up. Nishikori has three break points in the fifth game but can’t take any of them. Laaksonen survives that but Nishikori holds serve and then breaks to love in the seventh to go 4-3 ahead. A couple of stats to tell the story of the Azarenka v Keys game. Keys hit nearly three times as many winners (17 to Azarenka’s 6) but made a whopping 33 unforced errors in the 16 games they played. Azarenka’s count was 12. Out to Court Simonne-Mathieu now where Japan’s Kei Nishikori is doing battle with Switzerland’s Henri Laaksonen. It’s early days, with former US Open finalist Nishikori holding in the fourth game to make it 2-2 in the first set. Out on Court 14, Norway’s Casper Ruud continues to have his problems against Alejandro Davidovich Fokina. The Spaniard won the first set on a tie-break before 15th seed Ruud hit back to take the second 6-2. But Davidovic Fokina is now 3-0 up in the third. All over! Azarenka mistakenly thinks she’s served an ace at 30-30 but it’s called out. The second serve is long and the double fault gives Keys a break point but she hits a poor groundstroke halfway up the net, audibly giving herself a ticking off. Azarenka misses a first match point by going wide with a forehand and Keys hits a superb winner to save a second. But it’s third time lucky as another Keys error and an accurate serve down the middle from Azarenka seals a comfortable and deserved 6-2 6-2 victory. Azarenka, aided by a little luck at 30-15, holds serve to go 5-2 up. No margin for error now from Keys. Over on Court Suzanne-Lenglen, Federico Delbonis leads Fabio Fognini, the 27th seed, 5-4 in the opener and will be serving to win the set. Azarenka doesn’t wilt and survives some heavy Keys groundstrokes to reel off the next three points and take it to 30. The 15th seed leads 4-2 and is now just two games away from victory. Keys holds to reduce the deficit to 3-2 and now she’s 30-15 up on the Azarenka serve in the next. A change in momentum here perhaps. Keys gets a game back by winning the fourth but is still a break down at 1-3 in the second set against Azarenka. Thanks Luke. I’ll try and be the no-frills doubles partner that hogs the net and blocks a few back. Azarenka goes 3-0 up in the second, having won eight games in a row. Keys is not at the races. In the men’s singles, meanwhile: Alejandro Davidovich Fokina won his first set against Casper Ruud on a tie-breaker, but Ruud has just gone 4-1 up in the second set. And Federico Delbonis is 3-1 up on Fabio Fognini in their first set. Now, it’s time for me to hand over to David Tindall, and I’ll be back soon for the afternoon’s action ... Over on Philippe-Chatrier, Azarenka has broken Keys in the second and leads 2-0 after winning the first set 6-2. On Court 7, Zidansek and Siniakova are into a third and final set. Siniakova dominated the first set, 6-0, before Zidansek took the second set on a tie-breaker. All over. Pavlyuchenkova reaches the last 16 for the second time in her career - the last time she did so was 10 years ago. Sabalenka, in the second set, started to hit the ball in fearsome style and took it comfortably, 6-2. Pavlyuchenkova took a medical timeout - I am not sure what the problem was - and all the momentum that the world No 4 had built up seemed to disappear. However, Pavlyuchenkova played an excellent match, was far more consistent than her opponent, who produced a litany of unforced errors and is knocked out. At least Sabalenka will be able to say she took her shots on, and went down all guns blazing, even if blazing in accurately for the most part. Sabalenka edges to 30-30 with Pavlyuchenkova serving for the match. Can she strike back and find something in this third set? Azarenka wins the first set against Keys, 6-2. Break point for Pavlyuchenkova - and Sabalenka loses her composure again and crashes a big forehand very wide. It’s 5-0 in the deciding set, and surely, it’s all over. Now 4-0, as Pavlyuchenkova holds, and moves a step closer to the last 16. Sabalenka double-faults to kick off this service game, which she has to win to retain a slender chance of recovery. Deep trouble for Sabalenka, who now falls 3-0 behind in the third and final set. The precision of Pavlyuchenkova has been eye-catching in these past three games. Can Sabalenka, the world No 4, harness her power effectively once again as she did in that second set? Super stuff from Pavlyuchenkova, working her opponent around the court and fashioning the chance for a winner, and she has a chance to move 2-0 up in this decisive set ... which she does! Much as in the first set, frustration is creeping in for Sabalenka. Sabalenka makes it to 0-30 on her opponents serve, then nets a shot, much to her frustration. A brilliant volley from Pavlyuchenkova, on her toes, makes it 30-30 and now Sabalenka forces a break point. Azarenka has broken Keys, and leads 4-2 in the first. Pavlyuchenkova breaks! You have to wonder what the medical issue was. A cynic may suggest she simply took a few minutes out to try and stop Sabalenka’s momentum, which was looking unstoppable. Pavlyuchenkova is now back on court for the third set against Sabalenka. The No 3 seed is serving first in this deciding set. She double-faults twice to hand her opponent two break points. As suspected, that break for the medical timeout hasn’t done Sabalenka any good. Azarenka holds for 2-2 in the first set against Keys. Both have started the match well, both striking the ball sweetly, and looking pretty evenly matched in the rallies. Pavlyuchenkova has just walked off court for a medical timeout. If nothing else, that will interrupt Sabalenka’s rhythm: she was seeing it like a football in that second set, which she won 6-2. It’s with serve in the Azarenka v Keys match, at 2-1 to Keys, although it’s 30-30 on Azarenka’s serve now. In the battle of the Elenas, Rybakina has knocked out Vesnina, 6-1, 6-4. Sabalenka takes the second set, 6-2. Pavlyuchenkova simply couldn’t live with her opponent’s power and precision during that set. Sabalenka lacked precision in the first set, but has certainly found her range now, and there is going to be plenty of work to do for Pavlyuchenkova now. This is great to watch from Sabalenka, unless you are Pavlyuchenkova’s coach. Seemingly effortlessly she goes to 0-30 with a pass and a cleanly returned winner. And now to 0-40, three set points. The quality of Sabalenka’s hitting is looking more and more ominous for Pavlyuchenkova now. Sabalenka holds for 5-2, peppering her opponent with powerful groundstrokes, including one superb clean winner on her forehand side. Picturesque. An astonishingly good double-handed backhand return, which almost kisses the line right in the corner, creates two break points for Sabalenka. Pavlyuchenkova did not have a hope of getting close to that one. Sabalenka converts the first break point, and leads 4-2. She doesn’t over-celebrate, either, but looks quietly satisfied that her power hitting is starting to tell on the scoreboard. A comfortable Sabalenka hold for 3-2 in the second set. Meanwhile, Victoria Azarenka (15) and Madison Keys (23) are about to begin their third-round match on Court Philippe-Chatrier. Pavlyuchenkova, who is certainly looking the more consistent player, holds for 2-2. Sabalenka’s power is unstoppable when she gets it right, and she it not hesitating to attack, but she is also making too many errors in comparison with her opponent at the moment. Sabalenka puts away a forehand volley efficiently and holds comfortably for 2-1. Sabalenka has started this second set with renewed focus and is hitting the ball with serious authority compared to the second half of that first set. She goes on the attack to try and save a game point at 40-30, but sends a forehand wide, and it’s 1-1. Sabalenka holds serve impressively to open the second set, winning the first point with a cute drop-shot, and the second with another booming groundstroke to the baseline. Rybakina and Vesnina are now 2-2 in the second set, after Rybakina took the first 6-1. Over on Court 7, Katerina Siniakova took her first set against Tamara Zidansek 6-0, but Zidansek now leads 3-2 in the second. Pavlyuchenkova moves in behind a first serve and volleys decisively to take the first set, 6-4. It was very much a set of two halves, with Sabalenka sprinting out of the blocks and into a 3-0 lead. But a catalogue of errors by the Belarusian handed the initiative to Pavlyuchenkova, who won five straight games and sealed the set comfortably in the end. Unforced errors all over the place from Sabalenka. She dumps the first return of the game into the net, then sends a backhand long to gift Pavlyuchenkova a 30-0 advantage. Sabalenka holds, sealing the game with a big serve that was called out by a line judge. The umps leaves his seat to take a look at the mark, and rules it good. However, the Russian Pavlyuchenkova will now serve for the first set, at 5-4. A smart serve-volley from Pavlyuchenkova sees her save the break point, and she then takes the game for 5-3 in the first set. Sabalenka is clearly a bit frustrated with her game, and is occasionally venting her anger by winding up a huge forehand, or an unreasonably powerful second serve. Pavlyuchenkova attempts a delicate drop-volley which would put her 40-0 up on her serve, but places it fractionally wide. Sabalenka forces it to 30-30, and then absolutely destroys a brilliantly powerful forehand down the line for a break point. Much more like it from the Russian. Tennis - bloody hell! Pavlyuchenkova has now won four straight games and leads 4-3 in the first set. This one could get interesting. It’s 3-3 and all square in the first set between Pavlyuchenkova and Sabalenka. Sabalenka finds a couple of break points now, but the 29-year-old Pavlyuchenkova does well to bring it back to deuce in this sixth game of the first set. Our Eurosport commentator informs us that this is the 14th time Pavlyuchenkova has played at Roland Garros, which is quite a record. Sabalenka now saves a game point with a few massive groundstrokes that wear Pavlyuchenkova down with sheer force ... however, the Russian eventually finds a way. And now Pavlyuchenkova finds a break of her oppenents serve, and is right back in this first set at 3-2. Pavlyuchenkova is now on the board: it’s 3-1 in Sabalenka’s favour. Elsewhere, Elena Rybakina (21) now leads Elena Vesnina 5-0 in their first set. On Court Simonne Mathieu, Aryna Sabalenka (3) has raced into a 3-0 first-set lead against Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova (31). Sabalenka is the top-seeded player left in the women’s competition, following the withdrawals of Ash Barty and Naomi Osaka. The debate on Naomi Osaka’s withdrawal from this tournament rumbles on. Watch a video explainer, featuring the thoughts of our tennis reporter Tumaini Carayol, right here: Yesterday we saw Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Iga Swiatek, among others, progress safely to the third round at Roland Garros, while the women’s world No 1, Ash Barty, was forced to retire from her match against Magda Linette with a hip injury. There was also a notable flare-up over slow play between Federer and his opponent Marin Cilic. There was no shortage of action and drama on Thursday, so what will Friday bring?

He and his wife ate two meals a day, and their small community of 90 fishers regularly supported each other with food and money. “If we fish, money comes.

He and his wife ate two meals a day, and their small community of 90 fishers regularly supported each other with food and money. “If we fish, money comes. If not, we are left hungry,” he said. After the worst maritime disaster in Sri Lanka’s history poisoned the waters near where he fishes, however, he fears even that simple life is now in dire danger. “People are scared. Even if we caught fish, they wouldn’t eat it because they think it’s poisonous,” he said. The fire may be out aboard the cargo ship MV X-Press Pearl, which has now partially sunk, but observers fear the worst impacts of the chemical ship disaster are yet to come. The Singapore-flagged container vessel – travelling from Qatar to India, through Colombo on its way to Singapore – was carrying 350 tons of bunker fuel, which authorities say could spill out, hitting coastal communities. Fishing has been banned along the country’s western coastline for about 50 miles. Cutting off access to the sea means cutting off the livelihoods of coastal communities like Justin’s. Plastic pellets have also poured out from the ship’s containers, washing up on the beaches. The navy has been called out to clean the burnt wreckage and debris. But other effects cannot be easily cleaned – or even seen. The ship was carrying a whole array of hazardous chemicals: nitric acid, used for explosives; epoxy resins, used for paints and primers; and ethanol and lead ingots, used for manufacturing vehicle batteries. There were other products, too: caustic soda, lubricating oils, aluminium byproducts, polyethene used for grocery bags and packaging, cosmetics and even food items, according to Hemantha Withanage, an environmental scientist and executive director of the Centre for Environmental Justice in Sri Lanka. One container, Withanage noted, is named Environmentally Harmful Substances. “What are these substances? We don’t know. Authorities haven’t told us yet,” he said. “But why are they keeping this information a secret?” The sinking of the ship means the probable leaching of these chemicals into the ocean. “And that’s a serious risk to our ecosystem,” he said, explaining that it could lead to death and contamination of the corals, fish, turtles and other marine life that abound off the country’s coasts. Whales and dolphins frequent the oceans, and the coastal belt also provides a nesting ground for sea turtles: out of the seven types of sea turtles in the world, the Sri Lankan coast welcomes five of them. As the ship caught fire, images circulated on social media of fish, moray eels, rays and turtles washed up on the beaches. After a fire erupted in the ship because of an acid leak that began on 11 May 11, both Qatar and India denied permission for the boat to unload its chemical containers, according to reports. “We saved the lives of 25 sailors,” Withanage said. “That’s one of the biggest humanitarian actions we took, something we should be proud of, but it comes with an unmeasurable cost to our whole environment.” Across Sri Lanka, people are angry that the leaking ship was kept in the country’s waters. On social media many residents are lambasting what they see as the government’s negligence, leading to an environmental disaster. Withanage says the country’s lack of adequate equipment and an early response system meant that the fire spiralled out of control, leading to an explosion on the morning of 25 May, six days after the fire started. Indian emergency support came on 27 May. “The Sri Lankan unit used water for fire control, which is wrong because when harmful agents like sodium methoxide react with water, it forms corrosive substances and ignites a fire,” he said.

Trade news: The United Kingdom has secured a new trade deal with Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. The deal cuts tariffs on some agricultural goods such as UK cheese exports to Norway, along with tariff reductions and quotas on pork, and poultry. UK wines and spirits including Scotch Whisky will also now be recognised in Norway and Iceland, the Department for International Trade says. In return, import tariffs on shrimps, prawns and haddock coming into the UK will be cut. That, the UK says, will cut costs for UK fish processing and support jobs in that sector. The deal also includes a chapter on digital trade -- allowing electronic-only paperwork on goods trade which could make importing and exporting smoother. There’s a cap on mobile phone roaming charges, recognition of professional qualifications, and British businesses can bid for around £200m government contracts in partner countries. Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg told a news conference in Oslo that “the deal allows for growth in trade for both our countries”. But as the BBC points out, the deal won’t give the same opportunities as before Brexit. However, the Norwegian government said the deal with the UK would not restore all the advantages it had when both countries were in the EEA. “Prior to the UK’s exit from the EU, Norway enjoyed free movement of goods, services, capital and persons to the UK through the EEA agreement,” it said. “A free trade agreement will not provide similar access to the British market.” International Trade Secretary Liz Truss says it will boost trade: Today’s deal will be a major boost for our trade with Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, growing an economic relationship already worth £21.6bn, while supporting jobs and prosperity in all four nations at home. Here’s some reaction: It may be too early for a tipple.. but those with a taste for wine may be interested in a new fund-raising drive from English winemaker Chapel Down. My colleague Kalyeena Makortoff has the details: Chapel Down is asking the public to take part in a fresh funding round worth up to £7m that will help the business expand its vineyard in the North Downs and ramp up exports. It is the Kent company’s latest attempt to tap into investor enthusiasm for homegrown tipples as the democratisation of shareholding grows. Chapel Down plans to use the money to scale up its wineries and finish planting grapevines on the North Downs, where its vineyards are expected to produce an extra 500,000 bottles of English sparkling wine a year. Some of the cash will also help develop its online sales portal and export business. Chapel Down’s crowdfunding campaign, launched with the online equity crowdfunding service Seedrs, will allow the public to collectively buy up to 11.5m shares at 59.5p each, raking in as much as £6.9m. It will add to the £1.4m worth of shares to be bought up by the winemaker’s directors and backers, including the former Conservative party treasurer Michael Spencer.... A virtual GP appointments app used by the NHS has announced a £3bn US stock market listing after agreeing to a blank-cheque company merger that will net its British-Iranian founder almost £1bn. Babylon’s reverse merger with Alkuri Global, a New York-listed special-purpose acquisition company (Spac), makes it the latest firm to take advantage of a growing Spac trend that makes it cheaper for private companies to go public. The Financial Times explains that regulators in Brussels and the UK have launched “a joint assault” on Facebook’s use of customer data to dominate in core markets such as digital advertising. The Wall Street Journal say the moves are “ramping up regulatory scrutiny for the company in Europe”, adding: Both the European Commission—the EU’s top antitrust enforcer—and the U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority said Friday they are investigating whether Facebook repurposes data it gathers from advertisers who buy ads in order to give illegal advantages to its own services, including its Marketplace online flea market. Bloomberg has more details of the EU’s case: The European Commission said it will investigate whether Facebook misuses a trove of data gathered from advertisers to compete against them in classified ads. It will also check if the company unfairly ties its Marketplace small ad service to the social network. Friday’s move by the EU is the first time it’s escalated a case into Facebook’s behavior beyond the preliminary stages. It follows other high-profile cases targeting Google, Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. The EU previously fined Facebook for failing to provide correct information in the merger review of the WhatsApp takeover. Although the two investigations are separate, they were announced at the same time this morning. And both the UK’s CMA and the EC says they will “seek to work closely” together as these independent inquiries develop. Facebook says it will cooperate fully with both the EU and UK investigations “to demonstrate that they are without merit”. The social network giant explains: “Marketplace and Dating offer people more choices, and both products operate in highly competitive environment with many large incumbents”. We will continue to co-operate fully with the investigations to demonstrate that they are without merit.” Competition regulators in the UK and European Union have both launched investigations into Facebook, examining whether the social media giant is breaking competition rules. The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it will look into whether Facebook is abusing a dominant position in the social media or digital advertising markets, by using advertising data to gain an unfair advantage in the classified ads and online dating sectors. The CMA will examine if Facebook has unfairly used the data gained from its digital advertising services, and from its single sign-on service (Facebook Login), to benefit its own services. In particular, it will look at Facebook Marketplace (which runs classified adverts), and its dating profile service Facebook Dating. Andrea Coscelli, chief executive of the CMA, says the regulator will conduct a thorough investigation. “We intend to thoroughly investigate Facebook’s use of data to assess whether its business practices are giving it an unfair advantage in the online dating and classified ad sectors. “Any such advantage can make it harder for competing firms to succeed, including new and smaller businesses, and may reduce customer choice. Coscelli adds that the CMA will work closely with the European Commission... who have just announced their own antitrust investigation to assess whether Facebook violated EU competition rules. Again, the EC will examine if the tech giant used advertising data gathered in particular from advertisers in order to compete with them in markets where Facebook is active such as classified ads. The formal investigation will also assess whether Facebook has tied Marketplace to its social network, giving an unfair advantage in the online classified ads services and breaching the EU competition rules. It explains that online classified ads providers advertise their services on Facebook’s social network, while also competing with Facebook Marketplace. The EC says: Following a preliminary investigation, the Commission has concerns that Facebook may distort competition for the online classified ads services. In particular, Facebook might make use of the data obtained from competing providers in the context of their advertising on Facebook’s social network, to help Facebook Marketplace outcompete them. Facebook could, for instance, receive precise information on users’ preferences from its competitors’ advertisement activities and use such data in order to adapt Facebook Marketplace Competition chief, and executive vice-president, Margrethe Vestager, adds “Facebook is used by almost 3 billion people on a monthly basis and almost 7 million firms advertise on Facebook in total. Facebook collects vast troves of data on the activities of users of its social network and beyond, enabling it to target specific customer groups. We will look in detail at whether this data gives Facebook an undue competitive advantage in particular on the online classified ads sector, where people buy and sell goods every day, and where Facebook also competes with companies from which it collects data. In today’s digital economy, data should not be used in ways that distort competition.” Economist Richard Ramsey is also struck by the surge in construction costs - both for materials, and subcontractors: That last point suggests tradespeople are responding to the law of supply and demand, and pricing their time accordingly..... The UK building boom means that finding skilled construction workers is a real problem, says Duncan Brock, Group Director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply: “The construction sector continued its expansion programme with a phenomenal acceleration in growth and the strongest for seven years as new orders filled in at the fastest rate for almost a quarter of a century. Residential work was back in the top spot as house building rose at the quickest pace since August 2014, serving as an antidote to the recent scarcity in housing for lets or buy, and driven by consumer demand and a boost from the stamp duty holiday. “Busy purchasing managers were under pressure to keep up and buying up at the fastest rate since April 1997, changing sourcing strategies to find depleting essential materials and stocking up just as supply chain problems continued to mount along with prices. With inflation for goods and raw materials at a 24-year high, companies will be concerned that much-needed profits will be eaten away as building projects take shape and could be held up by some of the longest delivery times on record. Skills shortages are also becoming a problem, with recruiters finding talented labour hard to find, as job creation was at robust levels and the threat of staffing cutbacks has become a distant memory.” This chart, from the PMI report, shows just how badly supply chains are creaking: The surge in input price inflation is quite startling -- it’s being driven by soaring material costs, and shortages of stocks such as timber, roof tiles, paint, taps and concrete. UK building firms are hiring new staff at the fastest rate in seven years, to handle the surge in demand in May. New project starts and a sustained recovery in construction workloads resulted in the biggest jump in staffing numbers since July 2014, the PMI report shows. And with new orders flooding in, sub-contractor usage increased at a survey-record pace. UK construction has recorded its fastest growth in almost seven years, fuelled by the biggest jump in new orders since at least April 1997. The latest survey of UK construction shows that the sector benefitted from surging order books, driven by demand for new homes amid rising economic confidence. However, cost pressures are also at record levels, as builders scramble to find the raw materials and parts they need. That’s according to data firm IHS Markit, whose Construction PMI index has jumped to 64.2 in May, up from April’s 61.6. That shows very fast growth, and is the strongest reading since September 2014 (anything over 50 shows expansion). Markit says the UK construction sector is on a “strong recovery path”, with companies “highly upbeat” about growth prospects for the next year. New order volumes increased at the fastest pace since the survey began just over 24 years ago, while input cost inflation also hit a survey-record high during May. Business confidence among builders also jumped sharply, due to “resurgent customer demand”, and optimism about the UK economic outlook following the successful vaccine roll out. Markit reports: House building (index at 66.3) was the best-performing category of construction activity in May, followed by commercial work (64.4) The latest increase in work on commercial projects was the steepest since August 2007, reflecting strong demand conditions following the reopening of customer-facing areas of the UK economy. Civil engineering activity (index at 61.3) also increased sharply during May, although the pace of expansion eased slightly since the previous month. Tim Moore, Economics Director at IHS Markit, says supply chains are struggling to cope with this rapid output growth, and the surge in new orders to the highest in at least two decades. “There were widespread reports citing shortages of construction materials and wait times from suppliers lengthened considerably in comparison to those seen during April. Imbalanced supply and demand led to survey record increases in both purchasing prices and rates charged by sub-contractors. Despite severe challenges with materials availability, construction firms remain highly upbeat about their near-term growth prospects. Nearly two-thirds of the survey panel forecast an increase in output during the year ahead, while only one-in-thirteen forecast a decline. UK car sales continued to recover from their pandemic lows last month, but remain below their pre-Covid level. A total of 156,737 new cars were registered last month -- a jump of 674% compared with May 2020, during the first lockdown. This follows the reopening of car showrooms, and the relaxing of some pandemic restrictions in April and May. But, the market has not yet returned to normality. Sales are 14.7% lower than in May 2019, and over 13% below their average for the month over the last decade. And so far this year, car registrations are around 29% below their average levels. Sales to companies to businesses or organisations grew more than twice as fast as private purchases in May. These ‘fleet sales’ made up around half of all new vehicles hitting the road last month, totalling 79,435 sales -- ten times higher than a year ago. That shows improving business confidence, says the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said: “With dealerships back open and a brighter, sunnier, economic outlook, May’s registrations are as good as could reasonably be expected. Increased business confidence is driving the recovery, something that needs to be maintained and translated in private consumer demand as the economy emerges from pandemic support measures. Demand for electrified vehicles is helping encourage people into showrooms, but for these technologies to surpass their fossil-fuelled equivalents, a long term strategy for market transition and infrastructure investment is required.” So far this year, plug-in vehicles have accounted for 13.8% of new car registrations, up from 7.2% a year earlier, with plug-in hybrids (PHEV) growing fastest. Fully electric cars have made up 7.5% of sales this year, with pure petrol engines still around half the market. The Covid-19 restrictions on touring and performing are also encouraging artists to cash in the value of their music rights, points out John Coldham, IP partner at law firm, Gowling WLG. Here’s his take on the sale of Joel Little’s song catalogue to Hipgnosis: The trend to buy up the rights to songs continues, with this latest investment being a continuation of that. There is nothing new about rights to creative works being bought and sold, but it is interesting that, as the world evolves into digital streaming, there has been a spate of such high profile sales recently. It is likely that some artists wish to realise the value of their catalogue now, rather than wait for the trickle of streaming revenues to come in, especially as they are not able to perform live so easily in the present environment. These sales demonstrate the value of intellectual property, and ensuring its ownership is properly documented will assist in realising that value later. Music news: Grammy Award-winning songwriter, producer and musician Joel Little has become the latest musician to sell their works to Hipgnosis Songs Fund. Little has worked with several leading musicians - including Taylor Swift, and Lorde, co-writing and producing her debut EP and her first album, Pure Heroine’. The sale of Little’s musical catalogue comes amid the boom in streaming under the pandemic. Several other big music names have also taken this move; Hipgnosis have recently signed deals with the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Neil Young, Fleetwood Mac guitarist Lindsay Buckingham, and Barry Manilow, along with Metallica and Michael Bublé producer Bob Rock. Reuters has more details: Little, whose songs Hipgnosis says have been streamed over 15 billion times, co-wrote and produced four songs on Swift’s 2019 album “Lover,” including “Me!” and “The Man”. He has also collaborated with U.S. R&amp;B singer Khalid, and in 2014 won a Grammy award with New Zealand singer Lorde after co-producing and writing “Royals”. In 2014 Little co-wrote or produced songs for the “The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 1” movie. The catalogue totals 178 songs, Hipgnosis said in a statement, and between 2017-2019 earned revenue of $8.6 million. It did not disclose the size of the deal. With airlines under pressure, the London stock market is effectively becalmed this morning. The FTSE 100 index has dropped by 10 points, or 0.15%, to 7054 points while the more UK-focused FTSE 250 is flat. Traders are keeping firmly to the sidelines ahead of May’s US jobs report -- to see whether hiring bounced back, and whether wages are rising (cue more fretting about inflation). Connor Campbell of SpreadEx explains: Analysts’ estimates have the nonfarm number climbing to 645,000 [from 266k in April], with the unemployment rate falling from 6.1% to 5.9%. Average hourly earnings are, as ever, the one outlier, with expectations of 0.2% against the previous month’s 0.7%. Considering that nonfarm forecast lies somewhere between the levels expected last month, and the number produced last month, it will be interesting to see how investors react. It might hit that sweet spot – strong enough to point to a continuing recovery, but not strong enough to prompt any action from the Fed. Although the travel sector is clearly struggling, the wider UK economy is rebounding from the pandemic. Overnight, a survey has shown that British employers took on permanent staff last month at the fastest rate since at least the late 1990s. There was also a rush for short-term staff, with temporary staff placements growing at the fastest in six years, according to the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) trade body and accountants KPMG. Kate Shoesmith, REC deputy chief executive officer, said. “We now have a consistent picture over the past few months to show that confidence is growing and hiring plans are in motion.” The survey also found that companies are struggling to hire staff, due to pandemic uncertainty and fewer candidates from the EU. And that drove starting salaries rose last month, at the fastest rate since September 2018 -- in a boost to workers. Shoesmith said: “With demand spiking, the skills and labour shortages that already existed in the UK have come into sharper focus – and COVID has only made them worse.” AJ Bell financial analyst Danni Hewson says the UK’s new tighter travel restrictions are causing ‘aftershocks’ in the travel sector today: “The travel sector continued to see aftershocks from yesterday’s earthquake decision to remove Portugal from the green list of travel destinations from the UK. Hopes of anything approaching a normal summer for the industry now look pretty much over. “Domestically the hospitality sector will be hoping that a full reopening is still on the cards for the 21 June but creeping concern about the threat posed by the Delta variant may send any decision on this to the wire – which is clearly exceptionally unhelpful for businesses.” Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Travel stocks are sliding this morning after the UK government removed Portugal from the “green list” of countries exempt from significant travel restrictions, The decision to move Portugal to the amber list is a major blow to the airline sector - just weeks after the UK lifted restrictions on international flights. It has prompted warnings of a deepening crisis for aviation, with unions urging the ministers to provide more support. The move was bitterly criticised by the tourism industry, which had been hoping for more countries to be added to the ‘green list’, meaning passengers wouldn’t need to quarantine on their return. So the news that Portugal will moved to Amber on June 8th, while seven countries, including Egypt and Sri Lanka, are now on the “red list” of destinations that require hotel quarantine, has jolted the sector. Jet engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce, whose engine servicing business is dependent on planes racking up flying hours, are down almost 2.5% this morning, the biggest faller on the blue-chip FTSE 100. Shares in British Airways-owner IAG have dropped another 1.5% in early trading, adding to their 5% slide on Thursday as the Portugal news emerged. Travel stocks are also among the fallers on the FTSE 250 index, with budget airline easyJet dropping by 1.5% (it also fell 5% yesterday). Wizz Air, which warned this week that it would make another loss unless restrictions were eased, are down 2.5%. In Dublin, Ryanair have dropped another 1%. The move has also hit the cruise sector, where Carnival are down 2%. Yesterday’s selloff wiped around £2bn off travel stocks, as the prospect of revenues from Portugal trips faded. Transport secretary Grant Shapps blamed concerns of a new coronavirus mutation and rising cases for the move; although Portugal called the decision ‘unfathomable’. Airlines hit out at the plan, with EasyJet’s boss, Johan Lundgren, saying: “The government has torn up its own rulebook and ignored the science, throwing people’s plans into chaos, with virtually no notice or alternative options for travel from the UK. This decision essentially cuts the UK off from the rest of the world.” Unions are also concerned about the move, with prospect general secretary Mike Clancy warning that the industry risks losing ‘half of the summer’. “This news today is further evidence of the instability facing the aviation industry this summer. With government advice shifting regularly it is imperative that proper financial support for the sector is put in place. “Even in the most optimistic scenario, we now face losing half of the summer before holidaymakers can confidently book travel to major destinations, and the nearer we get to the school holidays the more likely they will be to just stay at home. Given the uncertainty, Clancy adds, the government must consider doing more to help the sector - or risk seeing travel firms collapse - pushing up unemployment. “The government starts phasing out its lifeline furlough scheme in four weeks’ time which is only adding to the damaging uncertainty facing aviation. Ministers need to make clear that further support will be available to support jobs while restrictions on tourist travel remain in place. Without this, there’s a risk that the industry will no longer be there when restrictions are lifted.” Also coming up today Investors are bracing for the latest US jobs report, the Non-Farm Payroll, which will show whether hiring in America recovered in May after slowing in April. Economists predict around 650,000 new hires last month, up from 266,000. A jump in employment would clearly be very welcome, as the US economy is still missing eight million jobs since the pandemic. But a stronger-than-expected NFP could also jolt the markets, intensifying concerns about inflation- and the possibility that central bankers end their stimulus programmes. Ricardo Evangelista, senior analyst at ActivTrades, explains: The narrative in the markets has been dominated by the risk of high inflation becoming a collateral effect of the ongoing gargantuan stimulus. The Fed has, so far, refused to blink, insisting that any spikes in prices are likely to be temporary and that bringing forward the tapering could damage the economic recovery. Amidst this tug-of-war, employment is likely to become a decisive factor, with a high reading having the potential to force the Fed to start thinking about tapering its current monetary and asset purchase policies. Looking at today’s dollar gains, it appears that many investors are already positioning themselves for such a scenario. G7 finance ministers are meeting in the UK for two days of talks, where they will try to hammer out a landmark deal to end tax avoidance by multinationals and big technology companies using tax havens to exploit loopholes in the global system. The UK and Norway are close to signing a trade deal, with a formal announcement expected as soon as today. UK sources have told City AM that the deal could could cut Norwegian tariffs on British agricultural exports, like beef and cheese, and provide more access to Norwegian fish imports to the UK.

Severe shortages of essential building materials lay behind the increase in prices as the combined impact of Brexit and the pandemic caused supplies, many of them imported, to be held up on their way to the UK. The majority of respondents to a survey by IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing Supply (CIPS) said they were paying significantly more for raw materials, pushing the industry inflation purchasing managers’ index (PMI) from an average of about 55 last year to more than 90 in May.

Tom Bailey scored a quickfire 31 to raise spirits, before picking up three wickets, as did Sajid Mahmood, as Glamorgan collapsed to 150 for nine. Somerset unveiled their usual back-to-front batting style against Hampshire, reeling at 43 for five, laughing at stumps, 360 all out. Keith Barker grabbed six for 72, picking off the Somerset top order – none who passed double figures apart from Steven Davies. The rearguard started with 45 from Tom Banton, and was bolstered by an eighth wicket stand of 171 between Lewis Gregory (107) and Roelof van der Merwe (88). Marcus Harris plundered 148, his second century in succession, put Leicestershire in a happy position against Gloucestershire. They ended the day at 357 for five. Worcestershire crumbled for 131 at New Road as Brydon Carse and Matty Potts snaffled four wickets each. Durham ended the day leading by nine with six wickets in hand, bolstered by 52 from Alex Lees. Fifties from Lyndon James, Steven Mullaney and Joe Clarke, who restarted his innings after retiring hurt, inched Nottinghamshire on to the front foot against Essex. Peter Siddle finished with three for 76. Sam Hain (77) and Michael Burgess (71) kept Warwickshire afloat on a muggy day at Derbyshire. Sam Conners had the top order in a pickle, taking the first four wickets, before the middle-order solidified to see them towards 272 for nine at stumps.

June has pulled on her best summer dress, the long-tailed tits are flitting in the neighbour’s garden and the day has been marred only by an accident with the caftiere. A smorgasbord of great cricket in store, hopefully not marred too much by the weather, though it is raining in Canterbury.","charCount":"8197","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/tanyaaldred\">Tanya Aldred</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2021/jun/04/yana-sizikova-arrested-at-french-open-tennis-in-match-fixing-investigation","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-04T12:06:24Z","webTitle":"Yana Sizikova arrested at French Open in match-fixing investigation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/jun/04/yana-sizikova-arrested-at-french-open-tennis-in-match-fixing-investigation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2021/jun/04/yana-sizikova-arrested-at-french-open-tennis-in-match-fixing-investigation","fields":{"headline":"Yana Sizikova arrested at French Open in match-fixing investigation","standfirst":"<ul><li>Russian player detained in case from last year’s tournament</li><li>Large sums reportedly wagered on break of serve in match</li></ul>","trailText":"Russian doubles specialist Yana Sizikova has been arrested in Paris by French police as part of a match fixing investigation","byline":"Tumaini Carayol","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cf4a00944b0e5ef0bc8ac02b9ecf921fa1b84474\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf4a00944b0e5ef0bc8ac02b9ecf921fa1b84474/518_601_2602_1561/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yana Sizikova was arrested in Paris on Thursday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yana Sizikova was arrested in Paris on Thursday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michal Kamaryt/CTK Photo/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Russian tennis player Yana Sizikova has been arrested in Paris by French police as part of a match fixing investigation, according to <a href=\"https://www.leparisien.fr/faits-divers/paris-suspects-a-roland-garros-une-joueuse-russe-interpellee-en-plein-tournoi-04-06-2021-QAERYFOCJJA3FM3YF6IV37JDGU.php\">Le Parisien</a>.

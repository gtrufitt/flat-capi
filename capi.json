Gagai has tackled Sims quite low which has left his arms free for a perfect pass to To’o in space to run the last couple of steps home. Cleary has been patched up and converts on the angle. To compound the bad news for Qld is news that Welch has failed his HIA. Unsurprising given how he looked. 24 mins: This time it’s To’o in the left corner. Cook is the orchestrator, weaving through the Maroons defence and letting fly a pass which hits Tedesco and bounces backwards. He regathers and then it’s Luai, Mitchell and To’o. Cleary has blood streaming down his face. But my, Cook is so fast. He is a surf lifesaving flags champion, did you know? Mitchell slots the conversion. 18 mins: Tommy Turbo! He’s rushing forward on the right and receives a long pass, gets on the outside of a static Capewell and is in. That was too easy, and my Queensland will be feeling about that needless penalty in the lead-up when Feldt took out Addo-Carr to give NSW six again right on their line. Trbojevic has been a standout so far. 16 mins: Looks like Munster hasn’t heard a six-to-go call. Crowd must be deafening. He kicks, and gifts NSW possession. 13 mins: Luai stabs the ball into Queensland’s corner and Holmes scoops up. Feldt brings the ball to the 30m line and Cherry-Evans kicks early. Ouch. Welsh is dizzy after a head clash. He stumbles attempting to walk and a trainer accompanies him off the field for an HIA. His night should be over. 10 mins: This game is lightning fast on this hard pitch. And how different the conditions are in Townsville at 18C while Melbourne, where this was supposed to be played is 18C and rainy. DCE is penalised and Nathan Cleary does the honours to give the Blues their first two points. Probably fair – they have had the better of the opening exchanges. 5mins: Kyle Feldt has had a nice couple of touches, a Townsville man making his debut at 29 as the Maroons edge forward. Fifita is up for it though. The ball is ping-ponging around before NSW are back in position but there’s been a needless drop as they approached the 20m line. Mitchell’s pass was not amazing but Sims probably should have caught it. 2mins: NSW run through a set before Cleary gets a kick away and Welsh and Grant makes some ground. The players are out on the field and the Welcome to Country has been performed. Now it’s the anthem. Getting close. I don’t have the benefit of Gallen’s wisdom, but from where I stand NSW will be best served with a couple of settling early tries, start on the front foot and remove Queensland’s home advantage. The stadium is seriously Maroon right now, maybe the most we’ve ever seen it. Jarome Luai will be key, and I’m intrigued to see how the Panthers clique operates. As the players warm up in the sheds, former Blues captain Paul Gallen is out on the pitch offering sage words of advice. “Stick to the game plan. Give 100% effort, 100% of the time. And if all else fails, just smash them.” Thanks Gal. Here’s more on the exceptional content out of Gladys Berejiklian’s ... darkened room? Only a matter of time before she’s trending. Here is the NSW team. The Maroons should be worried about Tom Trbojevic, according to James Tedesco. Have to say I concur. Not many blue shirts in the crowd, and it looks as if Flinders St is rocking. If you thought Brissy was Queensland territory, you should see Townsville. Gould is addressing the Blues’ position on the Nine panel: “We’re fine as long as they don’t jump the fence.” Believe it or not, NSW are favourites according to the bookies. I suppose that’s keeping with tradition. Billy Slater reckoned this week that the dry ground will suit Brad Fittler’s side. Guess we’ll find out shortly. The big question mark hovering ominously over this game is, of course, how the crackdown on high hits will manifest in terms of officiating. The NRL has already stated it will instruct referee Gerard Sutton to operate in the same manner as he would an NRL game, which would mean strict penalties for high contact, accidental or otherwise. Queensland captain Daly Cherry-Evans called for a “gentlemen’s agreement” between the two states not to milk high contact. NRL head of football Graham Annesley said it was “a concern”. “It’s an issue that’s difficult to deal with,” Annesley said this week. “The match review committee does have the ability to charge players with what they might consider to be contrary conduct. “I’d like to think the vast majority of players in our game do not do that. I’ve already seen the NSW Origin coach come out and say NSW players won’t be doing that, and I’m sure Queensland is the same.” Wondering if accidental contact will result in a send-off, or will there be some room to move with players placed on report and handled afterwards? The Queensland team has landed, and Ben Hunt is 18th man. All appears as expected. Gladys is getting the party started with all her friends. State of Origin week is rarely short of drama. Past years generated at least a headline a day and enough tit-for-tat to last a lifetime let alone 3x80 minutes of rugby league. In 2020, of course, the NRL backed down on its plan to forego the national anthem (hi ScoMo!). Similarly, the build-up to game one of this series did not disappoint. Granted, it has not delivered on a Robbie-Kearns-falls-off-a-horse level, but still ... we have witnessed NSW acts of espionage to conceal a SWAP IN POSITIONS between Blues wingers Josh Addo-Carr and Brian To’o, Queensland’s “smokescreening” around Dane Gagai’s alleged tonsillitis, and Phil Gould’s deep anxiety about the high-tackle crackdown’s potential to soften Origin’s “gladiators”. Oh, ICYMI, there was also a venue change after Victoria’s Covid outbreak forced game one to be moved to Townsville. Interested to hear your thoughts. It is, in my humble opinion, an excellent decision and a real regional win that could yet set a precedent for the future. Should we be sharing the Origin love a bit more? Anyway, here we go. Whether you are propped up on a bar stool, in a tent, or checking the score while watching re-runs of Friends, we’ll endeavour to keep you up to date on all the happenings at Queensland Country Bank Stadium.","charCount":"7496","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/emma-kemp\">Emma Kemp</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/live/2021/jun/09/brexit-northern-ireland-eu-trade-coronavirus-covid-uk-live-latest-news-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-09T11:05:42Z","webTitle":"PMQs: Boris Johnson faces questions from Keir Starmer – politics live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2021/jun/09/brexit-northern-ireland-eu-trade-coronavirus-covid-uk-live-latest-news-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/live/2021/jun/09/brexit-northern-ireland-eu-trade-coronavirus-covid-uk-live-latest-news-updates","fields":{"headline":"PMQs: Boris Johnson faces questions from Keir Starmer – politics live","standfirst":"<p>Latest updates: prime minister faces questions in Commons from Labour leader</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/08/tensions-rise-over-eu-trade-row-with-uk-over-sausage-sales\">Trade war threats will not wash with voters, Frost tells EU</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/09/covid-contract-for-firm-run-by-cummings-friends-was-unlawful-judge-rules\">Covid contract for firm run by Cummings’ friends unlawful, judge rules</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jun/09/brexit-what-is-the-northern-ireland-row-about\">Brexit: what is the Northern Ireland row about?</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/jun/09/australian-government-prepared-to-walk-away-from-uk-free-trade-deal-over-agricultural-access\">Australia prepared to walk away from UK free trade deal</a><br></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus – latest global updates</a><br></li></ul>","trailText":"Latest updates: prime minister faces questions in Commons from Labour leader","byline":"Andrew Sparrow","main":"<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a2b8a59b-ab16-4373-ac7e-c573d41a5635\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1nzCnwJYZgY?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>","body":"<div id=\"block-60c0a0198f08895fbfa9fed6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-09T11:05:42.478Z\">12.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Sir Keir Starmer </strong>starts by offering the PM “warm congratulations” on his marriage.</p> \n  <p>He asks why the PM thinks Sir Kevan Collins, his former education recovery adviser, described the government’s plan for catch-up learning as half-hearted and inadequate.</p> \n  <p><strong>Johnson</strong> says this will be the biggest tutoring programme in the world, based on the best evidence Collins could supply.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-60c09ff48f08aec839013a42\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-09T11:03:48.690Z\">12.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Ben Bradley</strong> (Con) asks for a meeting with the PM to discuss options for the East Midlands.</p> \n  <p><strong>Johnson</strong> says Bradley already has a ministerial meeting lined up.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-60c09fa58f08aec839013a3f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-09T11:03:12.097Z\">12.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Gavin Newlands</strong> (SNP) asks what the government is doing to stop “fire and rehire” policies.

Businesses in Great Britain are choosing not to sell their goods into Northern Ireland because of burdensome paperwork, medicine manufacturers are threatening to cut vital supplies, and chilled meats from British farmers destined for the Northern Ireland market are at risk of being banned entirely ...</p> \n   <p>Our overriding shared priority must be to protect the Belfast (Good Friday) agreement and the peace process. I look to the EU to show flexibility and engage with our proposals so that we can find solutions that enjoy the confidence of all communities.</p> \n   <p>Further threats of legal action and trade retaliation from the EU won’t make life any easier for the shopper in Strabane who can’t buy their favourite product. Nor will it benefit the small business in Ballymena struggling to source produce from their supplier in Birmingham.</p> \n   <p>What is needed is pragmatism and common sense solutions to resolve the issues as they are before us.

These involve checks on some goods, and potentially some restrictions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2021/jun/08/brexit-eustice-sausages-eu-northern-ireland-protocol-g7-covid-live?page=with:block-60bf1e1b8f0827600c04c306#block-60bf1e1b8f0827600c04c306\">(including later this year on sausages and other chilled meats)</a> to protect the EU single market, which includes Northern Ireland. The UK agreed to all these rules when it signed the Northern Ireland protocol. But now it is arguing that there is a need for a rethink because: a) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2021/jun/08/brexit-eustice-sausages-eu-northern-ireland-protocol-g7-covid-live?page=with:block-60bf5b688f0837b8708e1127#block-60bf5b688f0837b8708e1127\">the EU is being too “purist” in enforcing these rules</a>; and b) the UK did not fully realise what the protocol would involve.</p> \n  <p>Frost made this latter argument in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eb35a108-6186-42a4-b401-5e1df0e2c64a\">an article for the Financial Times (paywall)</a> at the weekend. He wrote:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We expected to be able to operate it in a way which respected the sensitive politics in Northern Ireland — after all that was the point of making special arrangements in the first place ...</p> \n   <p>We underestimated the effect of the protocol on goods movements to Northern Ireland, with some suppliers in Great Britain simply not sending their products because of the time-consuming paperwork required. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This morning <strong>Gavin Barwell,</strong> who as Theresa May’s chief of staff was fully involved in the Brexit talks until the summer of 2019, said it was just not plausible for Boris Johnson to claim that he did not know what he was signing up to. Barwell told the Today programme:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I don’t think the EU is ever going to think that is credible. The EU negotiating team have obviously worked very closely with the British negotiating team under both governments. They know the quality of the civil servants involved in that work, and they know that British ministers would have been have been advised in detail on the implications of what they were signing up to. </p> \n   <p>So I don’t think anyone who’s involved in the process is going to find it credible that the government signed up to something and didn’t understand what the consequences of that were. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked if he thought that the government was now only pretending that it did not realise how damaging the protocol would be when it signed it in 2019, Barwell said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It’s difficult to conceive of any other explanation. When I was working with Theresa [May], Boris Johnson was foreign secretary for a period of that time. He perfectly well understood what the previous iteration of the protocol meant in terms of regulatory checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</p> \n   <p>When the deal was published and the government brought its legislation forward, the explanatory memorandum for the bill, which explained what the bill meant, was very clear what the consequences would be. </p> \n   <p>And I think he and David Frost are intelligent people. I find it inconceivable that they didn’t understand what they were signing up to. They would have been advised very clearly by the civil service about that.</p> \n   <p>And I think it’s also important to consider the political context at the time. When Boris took over, he initially tried to prorogue parliament and leave without a deal. He wasn’t able to do that. So he then decided that he wanted to call an election to strengthen his position and it was clearly easier to fight that an election within an “oven-ready” Brexit deal. </p> \n   <p>So I think the calculation was sign up to whatever is on offer, and then see if we can deal with anything we don’t like down the line. I think the EU have come to the same conclusion as me and that’s why they’re taking the approach that they are now. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Barwell was expanding in his interview on a claim he made on Twitter on Monday.

He asks why the PM thinks Sir Kevan Collins, his former education recovery adviser, described the government’s plan for catch-up learning as half-hearted and inadequate. Johnson says this will be the biggest tutoring programme in the world, based on the best evidence Collins could supply. Ben Bradley (Con) asks for a meeting with the PM to discuss options for the East Midlands. Johnson says Bradley already has a ministerial meeting lined up. Gavin Newlands (SNP) asks what the government is doing to stop “fire and rehire” policies. The government is not protecting workers, he says. Johnson says the government has been clear that using threats of firing and rehiring as a negotiating tactic is unacceptable. It can only be used in limited circumstances, such as to reduce job losses, he says. Boris Johnson starts by saying he is delighted to be hosting the G7 summit this week. It is the first (in person) meeting of G7 leaders since the pandemic started, he says. Gavin Barwell, Theresa May’s former chief of staff, has responded to what Patrick O’Flynn said earlier about his criticism of the government’s stance on the Northern Ireland protocol. (See 10.30am.) PMQs is about to start. Here is the list of MPs down to ask a question. Priti Patel, the home secretary, has been addressing the Police Federation conference. She started her speech by telling officers that she saw her role as being their advocate in government. She said: Nothing gives me greater pride than the work that I’ve been able to do with men and women in policing who do an extraordinary job under increasingly extraordinary circumstances. And nothing has a stronger effect on me than talking to the families of police officers who’ve been killed in the line of duty. John [Apter, the Police Federation chair] and I have a shared duty, being an advocate for police, and I’m your political advocate in Westminster. It’s my job to make sure that you have what you need to do your job. Loyalists in Northern Ireland view Brexit’s Irish Sea trade border as a manifestation of attacks on their British identity, MPs have been told. As PA Media reports, Billy Hutchinson, the Progressive Unionist party (PUP) leader, told a Westminster committee the only way to resolve issues around the Northern Ireland protocol was through political means. PA says: However, Hutchinson warned that loyalist leaders had a “very difficult” job convincing some people within their community that protests should remain peaceful, claiming the reason the trade border was not placed on the Irish land border was due to the threat of republican violence. The PUP has a long-established link with the loyalist paramilitary organisation the Ulster Volunteer Force. Hutchinson, a Belfast city councillor, told the Northern Ireland affairs committee that the European single market represented the biggest threat to his British identity. “People are angry, people misunderstood how Brexit was going to play out and people didn’t realise that Brexit would have a bigger impact in Northern Ireland than it would have in the rest of the UK,” he said. “So the protocol is a manifestation of people attacking their Britishness or taking something away.” Here is my colleague David Conn’s story on the high court ruling on the award of the contract to Public First being illegal. Adults living in the most deprived areas of England are three times more likely to be hesitant about getting a coronavirus vaccine than those in the least deprived parts, PA Media reports. PA says: One in 10 people in the most deprived parts reported vaccine hesitancy between 28 April and 23 May, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This compares with 3% of those in the least deprived areas. Overall, hesitancy levels in Britain are slightly down from the previous month, the survey of 15,173 adults aged 16 years and over found. Some 94% of adults in Britain reported positive sentiment, while 6% reported hesitancy, compared with 93% and 7% respectively between 31 March and 25 April. One in eight (13%) of those aged 16-29 reported hesitancy - the highest proportion of all the age groups and unchanged from the previous month. Black or black British adults were the ethnic group reporting the highest level of vaccine hesitancy, at 21%. Jolyon Maugham, head of the Good Law Project, says the high court has ruled that the Cabinet Office’s decision to award a public opinion research contract worth £560,000 to a company with Tory links without putting it out to tender was unlawful. The Good Law Project has written up the ruling here. And the 43-page judgment is here (pdf). And here is the conclusion from Mrs Justice O’Farrell. For the reasons set out above, the claimant’s challenge to the defendant’s decision to award a contract to Public First and the award of the contract fails on grounds 1 and 2 but succeeds on ground 3. The claimant is entitled to a declaration that the decision of 5 June 2020 to award the contract to Public First gave rise to apparent bias and was unlawful. Following hand down of this judgment, the hearing will be adjourned to a date to be fixed for the purpose of any consequential matters, including any applications for permission to appeal, and any time limits are extended until such hearing or further order. Boris Johnson has thanked police officers for their work during the pandemic in a surprise video address to the Police Federation conference this morning. Delivering what he said was a “huge thank you”, he said: You’ve encouraged people to stick to the rules the same time as you’ve been fighting crime and you’ve each risen to an enormous challenge. Just as I could never have imagined being forced, as prime minister, to close pubs and bars and restaurants or tell people how many households could get together, I bet that policing restrictions in that way was not something you ever dreamt you would be doing. But you did it because you knew it was how we were going to protect the NHS and save lives. Johnson also said that the government had recruited 8,771 new officers and that it was 44% of the way towards the target of 20,000 extra officers by 2023. Arlene Foster, the outgoing DUP first minister of Northern Ireland, does not seem to agree with Gavin Barwell’s analysis of who is to blame for the problems with the Northern Ireland protocol. (See 8.48am.) She has posted this response to a tweet from the former Ukip MEP Patrick O’Flynn. More than 80% of adults in England and Wales would test positive for Covid antibodies, according to figures released by the Office for National Statistics this morning. The figures are lower for Northern Ireland (79.9%) and for Scotland (72.6%). Having antibodies can protect people from further infection. People acquire antibodies either through vaccination, or from being infected in the past. But antibody levels do not correspond to the total number of people vaccinated and infected in the past because over time antibody levels reduce to the point where they are no longer detected in tests. Here are the figures for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. They cover the week beginning Monday 17 May, and they are based on the results of a survey that involves tens of thousands of people being tested at random. And these charts compare the proportion of adults testing positive for antibodies (the dark blue line) with the proportion who have had one dose of vaccine (the green line) and the proportion fully vaccinated (the light green line). Lord Frost and his EU counterpart Maroš Šefčovič, vice-president of the European Commission, have started their talks at Admiralty House in London. Although it essentially one event, technically there are two meetings taking place: a meeting of the withdrawal agreement joint committee meeting (the body set up to oversee the implementation of the withdrawal agreement, including the Northern Ireland protocol); and a meeting of the partnership council (the body set up to oversee the implementation of the UK-EU trade deal, the trade and cooperation agreement). Frost and Šefčovič jointly chair both bodies. Here is the agenda (pdf) for the withdrawal agreement joint committee meeting. And here is the agenda (pdf) for the partnership council meeting. In a statement issued last night, ahead of his meeting this morning with Maroš Šefčovič, Lord Frost, the Brexit minister, urged the EU to adopt “pragmatism” and “common sense solutions” to resolve the problems in Northern Ireland. He said: I hope this will be a productive forum where we can address shared challenges by working together in the spirit of mutual trust and cooperation. First among these challenges is the damaging impact the protocol is having on the ground in Northern Ireland. Businesses in Great Britain are choosing not to sell their goods into Northern Ireland because of burdensome paperwork, medicine manufacturers are threatening to cut vital supplies, and chilled meats from British farmers destined for the Northern Ireland market are at risk of being banned entirely ... Our overriding shared priority must be to protect the Belfast (Good Friday) agreement and the peace process. I look to the EU to show flexibility and engage with our proposals so that we can find solutions that enjoy the confidence of all communities. Further threats of legal action and trade retaliation from the EU won’t make life any easier for the shopper in Strabane who can’t buy their favourite product. Nor will it benefit the small business in Ballymena struggling to source produce from their supplier in Birmingham. What is needed is pragmatism and common sense solutions to resolve the issues as they are before us. This work is important. And it is ever more urgent. Good morning. Lord Frost, the Brexit minister, is holding talks this morning with his EU counterpart, Maroš Šefčovič, in an attempt to resolve the increasingly acrimonious dispute about the post-Brexit rules in place governing trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. These involve checks on some goods, and potentially some restrictions (including later this year on sausages and other chilled meats) to protect the EU single market, which includes Northern Ireland. The UK agreed to all these rules when it signed the Northern Ireland protocol. But now it is arguing that there is a need for a rethink because: a) the EU is being too “purist” in enforcing these rules; and b) the UK did not fully realise what the protocol would involve. Frost made this latter argument in an article for the Financial Times (paywall) at the weekend. He wrote: We expected to be able to operate it in a way which respected the sensitive politics in Northern Ireland — after all that was the point of making special arrangements in the first place ... We underestimated the effect of the protocol on goods movements to Northern Ireland, with some suppliers in Great Britain simply not sending their products because of the time-consuming paperwork required. This morning Gavin Barwell, who as Theresa May’s chief of staff was fully involved in the Brexit talks until the summer of 2019, said it was just not plausible for Boris Johnson to claim that he did not know what he was signing up to. Barwell told the Today programme: I don’t think the EU is ever going to think that is credible. The EU negotiating team have obviously worked very closely with the British negotiating team under both governments. They know the quality of the civil servants involved in that work, and they know that British ministers would have been have been advised in detail on the implications of what they were signing up to. So I don’t think anyone who’s involved in the process is going to find it credible that the government signed up to something and didn’t understand what the consequences of that were. Asked if he thought that the government was now only pretending that it did not realise how damaging the protocol would be when it signed it in 2019, Barwell said: It’s difficult to conceive of any other explanation. When I was working with Theresa [May], Boris Johnson was foreign secretary for a period of that time. He perfectly well understood what the previous iteration of the protocol meant in terms of regulatory checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. When the deal was published and the government brought its legislation forward, the explanatory memorandum for the bill, which explained what the bill meant, was very clear what the consequences would be. And I think he and David Frost are intelligent people. I find it inconceivable that they didn’t understand what they were signing up to. They would have been advised very clearly by the civil service about that. And I think it’s also important to consider the political context at the time. When Boris took over, he initially tried to prorogue parliament and leave without a deal. He wasn’t able to do that. So he then decided that he wanted to call an election to strengthen his position and it was clearly easier to fight that an election within an “oven-ready” Brexit deal. So I think the calculation was sign up to whatever is on offer, and then see if we can deal with anything we don’t like down the line. I think the EU have come to the same conclusion as me and that’s why they’re taking the approach that they are now. Barwell was expanding in his interview on a claim he made on Twitter on Monday. Yesterday Downing Street said Barwell’s analysis was wrong. Here is the agenda for the day. Morning: Lord Frost, the Brexit minister, and Maroš Šefčovič, his EU counterpart, co-chair a meeting of the partnership council and the withdrawal agreement joint committee, which will mostly focus on the Northern Ireland protocol. 9.30am: The ONS publishes new figures on vaccine hesitancy, and on antibody levels in the UK. 11.15am: Priti Patel, the home secretary, gives a speech to the Police Federation. 12pm: Boris Johnson faces Sir Keir Starmer at PMQs. 12.30pm: Šefčovič holds a press briefing after his meeting with Frost. After 12.30pm: MPs begin a debate on a Labour motion criticising the government’s plans to help pupils make up for the learning lost during the pandemic. It says “the current half-hearted approach risks failing hundreds of thousands of young people” and calls for a more ambitious plan. 1.30pm: Downing Street is expected to hold its daily lobby briefing. Afternoon: Johnson travels to Cornwall, where he will be hosting the G7 summit later this week.

She started to go for her shots again, rather than let Gauff dictate the rallies as she has done the last three matches, and goes to 40-0 up. Three more match points down, Gauff can only hit wide and Krejcikova throws her hands in the air. Her face is more surprised than jubilant, but what a moment for the 25-year-old!

Krejcikova is having issues with her ball toss, but battles back to 30-30. This feels like a microcosm of the first set.

Coco Gauff kicks things off on Philippe-Chatrier against Barbora Krejcikova. At 17, she is the youngest grand slam quarter-finalist for 15 years, but you can’t help feeling that this is just another tiny milestone in what will surely be a remarkable career. </p> <p>Both players will be nervous, though. The unseeded Krejcikova beat Sloane Stephens to reach this stage but admitted afterwards that she nearly didn’t take the court in the fourth-round due to nerves. She is traditionally a doubles player, but this is the first time she has reached the last eight of a grand slam. </p> <p><em>“You know, half an hour before the match, I didn’t even want to step on the court, because I just felt really bad, and I had to lock myself in the physio room and I had to talk to my psychologist. I was actually crying. We talked about it a lot, and she told me, ‘If you can overcome this, what you feel right now, it’s going to be a huge win, and it doesn’t matter if you’re going to win on the court or lose on the court, because it’s going to be a personal win’.” I think after the first point things got a little bit better, a little bit easier. Then I broke her. I just felt like yeah, you know, I can play, I can actually play her. So I think I was just more stressed that I’m just not going to be good enough. I think that’s what happened.”</em></p> <p>We join the match with Gauff an break up at 3-0 in the first set. After a double fault on the first point of the match, Gauff has certainly come out of the traps with more authority. Perhaps with the above comments, that is not surprising. But perhaps Krejcikova will take her time to grow into the match. </p> <h2>Wednesday’s order of play</h2> <ul> <li>Coco Gauff v Barbora Krejcíkova</li> <li>Maria Sakkari v Iga Swiatek</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Diego Schwartzman v Rafael Nadal</li> <li>Novak Djokovic v Matteo Berrettini</li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-06-09T10:21:19.945Z\">at 11.21am BST</time></p>  </div>","wordcount":"2010","firstPublicationDate":"2021-06-09T09:23:42Z","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2021-06-09T11:04:42Z","liveBloggingNow":"true","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/p/hmxg5","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad5d305ac3e612f656758f8143382c329a298a03/0_130_5112_3067/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","isLive":"true","bodyText":"Krejcikova deserves this. She looked shaky at the start, came through some break points in the first set when all looked lost, and has had the quality to despatch Gauff when she has been on top. Ranked 33 in the world, she looked every inch a top 10 player here, and definitely capable of winning her first grand slam title. Nerves of steel in the last game of the match. She started to go for her shots again, rather than let Gauff dictate the rallies as she has done the last three matches, and goes to 40-0 up. Three more match points down, Gauff can only hit wide and Krejcikova throws her hands in the air. Her face is more surprised than jubilant, but what a moment for the 25-year-old! Her first grand slam semi-final. A year ago, she was outside the top 100! Second set: Gauff 6-7 (6), 3-5 Krejcikova* (*denotes next server) Gauff goes to a 30-0 lead but Krejcikova pegs her back before edging a rally to take her to her fourth match point! Second serve, and Gauff bunts one up the T! The guts on this teenager! For all her poorness in this second set, the American can be clutch. A fifth match point for Krejcikova comes and goes, before Gauff closes out the game. Wow! Gauff is motoring! Can Krejcikova hold her nerve? Second set: Gauff* 6-7 (6), 2-5 Krejcikova (*denotes next server) A wonderful Krejcikova backhand down the line sets up three match points, but Gauff somehow makes it back to deuce! A mixture of Krejcikova choking on some easy baseline shots and Gauff’s gutsy plays. At 40-30 up, with Gauff stranded out wide, Krejcikova had the whole court to aim for to win the match, but she hits wide into the tramlines! And Gauff comes back to break! She couldn’t? Could she? Second set: Gauff 6-7 (6), 1-5 Krejcikova* (*denotes next server) Up until that double fault, I’m not sure how many consecutive points Krejcikova won but I would guess around a dozen. Gauff can’t win a grand slam quarter final with those numbers. A brief hiatus at 5-0 down, as Gauff briefly gathers herself – despite a couple of bad errors, including one errant volley that she shoved well long of the baseline, she aces out wide to hold her serve, and secure her first game of the second set. But Krejcikova will serve for the match. Second set: Gauff* 6-7 (6), 0-5 Krejcikova (*denotes next server) Gauff can’t a single shot in. Krejcikova races to another 40-0 lead on serve, and it is only a double fault that stops yet another hold of serve to love. Gauff is surely beaten, and Krejcikova is one game away from a semi-final at Roland Garros! Second set: Gauff 6-7 (6), 0-4 Krejcikova* (*denotes next server) The crowd try their best to get Gauff going, but the American looks on the verge of tears as she hits a double fault into the net at 0-40 down on her own serve. Her racket gets a good smashing, three separate blows on the clay leave it twisted and broken. A warning from the umpire, complete head loss from Gauff. This is easy for Krejcikova. Second set: Gauff* 6-7 (6), 0-3 Krejcikova (*denotes next server) The sound of an ambulance can be heard careering down some Parisian street outside Chatrier, and one can’t help feeling that it might be for Gauff, who is playing herself out of the tournament here. Krejcikova is doing nothing special, simply bunting it back the other end, as Gauff hits long and wide, time after time. A hold to love. Second set: Gauff 6-7 (6), 0-2 Krejcikova* (*denotes next server) Gauff is slightly wavering here. Her decision making has deteriorated, and Krejcikova is quite happy to stay in the rally with big looping shots that come down with snow on to land on Gauff’s baseline and the American is unable to use her power effectively. Clever, clever tennis from Krejcikova, who only needs one break point to race to a 2-0 lead in the second set! Second set: Gauff* 6-7 (6), 0-1 Krejcikova (*denotes next server) I still have no idea who is going to win this match. The quality of tennis in that first set ranged from top drawer to mediocre, particularly the serving. Again this looks like Krejcikova’s weakness as Gauff threatens with another break point. But Gauff looks a little too eager to capitalise on Krejcikova’s serving and she hits a return into a net before Krejcikova holds. An early mini-break for Krejcikova but she hands back the advantage with a double fault, her sixth of the set. But now Gauff does the same, her fifth double fault of the match so far. It looks very hot now on Chatrier, and I wonder if the sun is blinding the pair as they serve? Krejcikova looks set to go to a 4-2 lead in the tie-break but bins an easy shot into the net, and complains to the umpire about a call from the crowd that put her off. Will that throw the Czech off? Things aren’t helped as Gauff clips one off the net to go 5-4 up and then hits an unforced error barely half-way up the net. Two set points for Gauff! Krejcikova responds, just as she has all set, two clean forehand winner just when she needed it! We’re back to 6-6 in the tiebreak! What cajones from Krejcikova, who now forces her own set point … and she gets it with a serve out wide and forehand winner! I’m not quite sure how, but the Czech player is halfway to her first ever grand slam semi-final! First set: Gauff* 6-6 Krejcikova (*denotes next server) Gauff races to 0-30, showing a bit of patience in the rally that has been missing this set. She is often so desperate to play the Hollywood winner, which is so often is capable of hitting, but forgets to play the percentages, which of courses makes for much more entertaining tennis. Krejcikova is having issues with her ball toss, but battles back to 30-30. This feels like a microcosm of the first set. Gauff gets to set point, and despite two more ball tosses that nearly end up next to the corporate seats, Krejcikova somehow gets back to deuce. Again, Gauff gets to break point with a outrageous winner on the run, before Krejcikova saves her set with her first backhand winner of the match, landing just inside the line. What a time to pull that one out! Gauff is the one to crumble now, with two unforced errors, and Krejcikova somehow holds! To a tie-break we go! First set: Gauff 6-5 Krejcikova* (*denotes next server) Spectacular from both players, but Gauff in particular. The American gets to a drop volley, hits a clean winner with two feet fully off the ground, and then somehow scrambles to hit a sublime forehand up the line. At 40-15, she serves out the game. Absolutely ridiculous. Gauff is absolutely ridiculous. Krejcikova was powerless there but it remains on serve. First set: Gauff* 5-5 Krejcikova (*denotes next server) As simple a hold as you are ever likely to see from Krejcikova, who even threw in a slice (!!!) to change up the pace and unnerve Gauff. First set: Gauff 5-4 Krejcikova* (*denotes next server) Gauff’s first ace takes her to 30-15, before another takes her to set point at 40-30. A huge scream from the American carries around Chatrier. She is FIRED UP! But then! A wayward Gauff backhand and a double fault hands break point to Krejcikova, before Gauff bins a simple shot into the net. We’re back on serve! Really difficult to predict where this set and match is going to go. Both players are hitting aces, winners and double faults, looking equally sublime and ridiculous in the process. First set: Gauff* 5-3 Krejcikova (*denotes next server) Krejcikova beginning to win a few cheap point on her serve – she wants to keep the rallies short if she can, as Gauff’s mobility around the court is far superior. Gauff isn’t playing her best but gets to break point, and bullies her way past the Czech with a ripping crosscourt forehand. Gauff will serve for the first set! First set: Gauff 4-3 Krejcikova* (*denotes next server) It’s only when the camera focuses on Gauff’s face that we remember how young she is. She’s got to show a little bit of maturity here, having lost the last three games. Three double faults in the game don’t help her here in this game, and a couple of errant ball tosses maybe betray her own nerves. But a clever serve out wide sends Krejcikova nearly hurtling into the stands and Gauff holds to break the run of games in her favour. We’re on serve. First set: Gauff* 3-3 Krejcikova (*denotes next server) A break point down, Krejcikova fires her first ace up the T to relieve some pressure before a second ace sets up game point. Krejcikova hits a heavy ball out wide, Gauff cannot retrieve and suddenly we’re all square! First set: Gauff 3-2* Krejcikova (*denotes next server) OK, OK, looks like we’ve got ourselves a ball game. Again, Gauff shows signs of her power and accuracy in some points, but Krejcikova is growing into this match. Her baseline shots are getting deeper and fiercer and she’s looking like she’s enjoying herself now. Gauff hits long and we’re a break each at 3-2! First set: Gauff* 3-1 Krejcikova (*denotes next server) Krejcikova gets on the board with her first game and cracks her first smile of the day. It looks like the weight of the world has lifted off of her shoulders now that she knows that she won’t be bagelled. A real battling hold that, because in between a few sloppy errors, Gauff put on an exhibition of fabulous shots, from backhand winners to a deft drop volley at the net, to a wonderful scrambling defence to cover the baseline.

Both these qualities make it an ideal plant-based substitute for white fish in the classic chippie supper, offering a similar delicacy of flavour and satisfying contrast of textures without the distracting saltiness of halloumi or the chew of banana flowers, which are sometimes used as fish-free alternatives instead.</p> <p>After posting pictures of my <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/COnISe1h1ig/\">various</a> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/COleRyOBaK6/\">attempts</a> online, I was astonished by the vehemence of the response, to which I say, no one’s forcing you to try it, but you shouldn’t knock it until you have – after all, although<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/green-living-blog/2010/feb/15/ask-leo-tofu-bad-for-environment\"> tofu isn’t without its environmental concerns</a>, few would deny that we need to be more mindful of the fish we eat and, almost as importantly, this is bloody delicious.</p> <h2>The tofu</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"1bfef0ea137e70f607d3fd0cee25f80a41c0c7b6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1bfef0ea137e70f607d3fd0cee25f80a41c0c7b6/0_0_3024_4032/750.jpg\" alt=\"Sam Turnbull’s tofish for Felicity Cloake’s perfect ‘tofish’, June 5 2021.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sam Turnbull’s tofish: it’s flaked – like fish.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most recipes call for extra-firm tofu, with a few simply specifying firm. In this instance, once it’s been pressed and battered, it doesn’t seem to make a great deal of difference, though I prefer the marginally softer texture of the latter. How you treat it is of greater importance – there’s no need to simmer it with salt and lemon to “add firmness”, as the<a href=\"https://vegsoc.org/recipes/battered-tofufish/\"> Vegetarian Society recommends</a>, because white fish is no firmer than tofu and certainly never chewy. The same goes for the<a href=\"https://www.seriouseats.com/what-to-do-with-leftover-tofu-freezing-frozen\"> time-honoured Japanese technique of freezing and then thawing the tofu before use</a>, so it takes on the texture of a sponge – great if you want it to absorb maximum flavour from a marinade or to develop a crisp exterior, but completely unnecessary if you want it to retain its smooth, milky magnificence within a crunchy, batter jacket.</p> <p>One idea that is worth exploring, however, is cutting the tofu into large flakes, to mimic the texture of fish,<a href=\"https://itdoesnttastelikechicken.com/tofish-and-chips-vegan-fish-and-chips/\"> as suggested by Sam Turnbull of the It Doesn’t Taste Like Chicken blog</a>, who herself adapted it from Jules <a href=\"https://www.theeasyvegan.org/vegan-flaky-fish-chips/\">The Easy Vegan</a>, who … well, whoever came up with it, it’s both obvious, and very effective. I’m going to combine their methods by not cutting through the fish entirely, and sprinkling seasoning into the cuts, rather than faffing about with toothpicks. (Note that, with extra-firm or firm tofu, there’s no real need to press it for this recipe.)</p> <h2>The seasoning</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"dbdc8dfa1019296728b5ae757830cf83eb6037b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dbdc8dfa1019296728b5ae757830cf83eb6037b9/0_0_3024_4032/750.jpg\" alt=\"Bosh’s lemon juice, white wine and caper brine version.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">B<a href=\"https://www.sainsburysmagazine.co.uk/recipes/mains/vegan-fish-and-chips\">osh’s lemon juice, white wine and caper brine version</a>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tofu is not, in general, good at absorbing marinades, unless you’ve pressed most of the water out of it, but that’s no problem here, because white fish doesn’t have an assertive flavour – so while Turnbull’s overnight bath of vegetable stock, lemon juice, white miso paste, onion powder, garlic powder and salt makes her tofu taste pretty good, it’s nothing like cod or haddock.

Both these qualities make it an ideal plant-based substitute for white fish in the classic chippie supper, offering a similar delicacy of flavour and satisfying contrast of textures without the distracting saltiness of halloumi or the chew of banana flowers, which are sometimes used as fish-free alternatives instead. After posting pictures of my various attempts online, I was astonished by the vehemence of the response, to which I say, no one’s forcing you to try it, but you shouldn’t knock it until you have – after all, although tofu isn’t without its environmental concerns, few would deny that we need to be more mindful of the fish we eat and, almost as importantly, this is bloody delicious. The tofu Most recipes call for extra-firm tofu, with a few simply specifying firm. In this instance, once it’s been pressed and battered, it doesn’t seem to make a great deal of difference, though I prefer the marginally softer texture of the latter. How you treat it is of greater importance – there’s no need to simmer it with salt and lemon to “add firmness”, as the Vegetarian Society recommends, because white fish is no firmer than tofu and certainly never chewy. The same goes for the time-honoured Japanese technique of freezing and then thawing the tofu before use, so it takes on the texture of a sponge – great if you want it to absorb maximum flavour from a marinade or to develop a crisp exterior, but completely unnecessary if you want it to retain its smooth, milky magnificence within a crunchy, batter jacket. One idea that is worth exploring, however, is cutting the tofu into large flakes, to mimic the texture of fish, as suggested by Sam Turnbull of the It Doesn’t Taste Like Chicken blog, who herself adapted it from Jules The Easy Vegan, who … well, whoever came up with it, it’s both obvious, and very effective. I’m going to combine their methods by not cutting through the fish entirely, and sprinkling seasoning into the cuts, rather than faffing about with toothpicks. (Note that, with extra-firm or firm tofu, there’s no real need to press it for this recipe.) The seasoning Tofu is not, in general, good at absorbing marinades, unless you’ve pressed most of the water out of it, but that’s no problem here, because white fish doesn’t have an assertive flavour – so while Turnbull’s overnight bath of vegetable stock, lemon juice, white miso paste, onion powder, garlic powder and salt makes her tofu taste pretty good, it’s nothing like cod or haddock. The same goes for Bosh’s lemon juice, white wine and caper brine version. As in the original dish, such tangy flavours are better saved for the accompanying sauce. That said, fish does taste, well, fishy, and the best way to recreate this with plant-based ingredients is to make use of a plant that grows in the same environment, namely seaweed. It’s common to use a sheet of nori (dried laver) to act as the “skin”, which is a nice idea even if you’re northern and shudder at the thought of skin on battered fish, but Jules’ notion of using seaweed flakes to season between the flakes ensures you get the flavour in every bite. Cauldron makes a kind of tartare-flavoured paste with chopped gherkins, capers and flour to smear on top of the tofu, which looks and tastes great, but I’d like to stick as close as possible to the original and save those ingredients for the accompaniment. The batter This is, of course, the same deal as with battered fish, as long as you make sure the beer you use is vegan-friendly, if that’s a concern. No need to add seaweed flakes, as Tofoo recommend, and, if you’re cooking British-style fish and chips, steer clear of the paprika, garlic powder, onion powder and turmeric employed by Turnbull and Loubna of the Glowing Blush blog – the pleasure here is in quiet flavours, doused in salt and vinegar. Hey, I don’t make the rules. Instead, volume is the thing to concentrate on; baking powder is helpful, as is using a carbonated liquid such as cold beer or fizzy water (beer gives a better flavour, so even if you don’t drink, you might want to consider investing in some alcohol-free stuff for this dish). The Vegan Recipe Club offers the most voluminous of batter recipes, which has no need of Bosh’s second coat, because it’s crunchy enough already. The cooking Loubna rolls the battered fish in panko breadcrumbs and bakes it.

If deep-frying scares you (and, with the appropriate amount of caution and respect for hot oil, it shouldn’t), I’m afraid this is not the recipe for you. Serve with chips (you’ve got the oil going anyway, so you may as well make your own and keep them warm in the oven while you fry the tofu), proper mushy peas and vegan tartare sauce.

I have always wanted to take a picture of a male mandarin duck. It is the bird that made me want to start taking photographs. They are beautiful, with so many stunning colours. At the end of January, I had heard via Facebook that there was a pair of them up the road from me. I got up early and drove to Balloch. I had all but given up hope, when all of a sudden I saw the bright orange tail feathers of the duck in between some bushes on the river’s edge. I had to lean on a tree that was in the water to take the pictures.

Bald eagles are an environmental success story – after the banning of the insecticide DDT, their numbers have rebounded spectacularly and they are now common around here. <strong>Gillian Henry, 63, retired medical researcher, Luck, Wisconsin, USA</strong></p> <h2>‘This species was only discovered as recently as 1996’</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c4e8f9ebaa63104f3886f8824b693632de8e3456\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c4e8f9ebaa63104f3886f8824b693632de8e3456/0_91_2130_1278/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An araripe manakin seen in Arajara Park in Ceará, Brazil in November 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An araripe manakin seen in Arajara Park in Ceará, Brazil in November 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phillip Edwards</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This photo of an araripe manakin was taken in November 2018 in Arajara Park – a water park in Ceará, Brazil.

Luckily, I met the resident bird guide who told me I could join a bird walk for only $20. At six o’clock the next morning, the guide explained that we would have to climb a steep, muddy cliff which few hotel guests were willing to do. After 30 minutes, we were rewarded with distant views of two males 100 meters away. The guide and I agreed that seeing some of the best birds always requires effort and patience.

I have always wanted to take a picture of a male mandarin duck. It is the bird that made me want to start taking photographs. They are beautiful, with so many stunning colours. At the end of January, I had heard via Facebook that there was a pair of them up the road from me. I got up early and drove to Balloch. I had all but given up hope, when all of a sudden I saw the bright orange tail feathers of the duck in between some bushes on the river’s edge. I had to lean on a tree that was in the water to take the pictures. I then fell into the water and tore my trousers, but it was worth it.

The film is maybe a little callow, but it’s an undoubtedly impressive and accomplished debut. • Shiva Baby is released on 9 June in cinemas and on 11 June on Mubi.","charCount":"2140","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"true","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/peterbradshaw\">Peter Bradshaw</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"artanddesign/2021/jun/09/artes-mundi-9-review-wide-ranging-show-dominated-by-one-devastating-work","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-09T10:57:46Z","webTitle":"Artes Mundi 9 review – wide-ranging show dominated by one devastating work","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/jun/09/artes-mundi-9-review-wide-ranging-show-dominated-by-one-devastating-work","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2021/jun/09/artes-mundi-9-review-wide-ranging-show-dominated-by-one-devastating-work","fields":{"headline":"Artes Mundi 9 review – wide-ranging show dominated by one devastating work","standfirst":"<p><strong>National Museum Cardiff </strong><br></p><p>Six artists take us from the post-colonial Caribbean to rural India, but Meiro Koizumi’s unflinching telling of Japanese atrocities in China will be seared in the memory </p>","trailText":"Six artists take us from the post-colonial Caribbean to rural India, but Meiro Koizumi’s unflinching telling of Japanese atrocities in China will be seared in the memory ","byline":"Adrian Searle","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1780a39c0da93215929935a54cf70bfd0c2e618a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1780a39c0da93215929935a54cf70bfd0c2e618a/416_0_3598_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Army veteran Hajime Kondo in Meiro Koizumi’s The Angels of Testimony\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Unflinchingly raw … army veteran Hajime Kondo in Meiro Koizumi’s The Angels of Testimony</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy the artist, Annet Gelink Gallery, Amsterdam and MUJIN-To Production, Tokyo</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>A<a href=\"https://artesmundi.org/\">rtes Mundi 9</a> is, like its predecessors, a complex affair.

And to be perfectly honest, the fan zone is a big event, there’s a lot of sponsors involved, and there’s a lot of money associated with this, it’s very difficult to go back on it now or indeed introduce new restrictions late in the day.” She added that while outdoor events with social distancing were generally low risk, “it’s all the things that come with a mass event. People on public transport travelling into the area from elsewhere, using toilets and maybe other indoor spaces, and then obviously if the matches get under way and the results are good, which everybody hopes, people might lose some of their inhibitions and there might be embracing and that has risks.” Opposition parties are also calling on the Scottish government to review inconsistencies in restrictions. Fraser, the Scottish Conservative spokesperson for Covid recovery, told BBC Radio Scotland: “It’s absolute nonsense to allow up to 6,000 football fans to gather in the open air in Glasgow for one event, and not allow parents throughout Scotland to attend their school sport days in the open air, providing they’re doing so in a socially distanced and responsible manner, because the risk of infection from that must be lower than from this event in Glasgow.”","charCount":"3658","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/libbybrooks\">Libby Brooks</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/jun/09/uk-to-trial-highly-protected-marine-areas-in-win-for-ocean-campaigners","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-09T10:54:04Z","webTitle":"UK to trial ‘highly protected marine areas’ in win for ocean campaigners","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jun/09/uk-to-trial-highly-protected-marine-areas-in-win-for-ocean-campaigners","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/jun/09/uk-to-trial-highly-protected-marine-areas-in-win-for-ocean-campaigners","fields":{"headline":"UK to trial ‘highly protected marine areas’ in win for ocean campaigners","standfirst":"<p>‘Historic’ move to ban destructive fishing methods in five habitats welcomed, but conservationists say change must come faster<br></p>","trailText":"‘Historic’ move to ban destructive fishing methods in five habitats welcomed, but conservationists say change must come faster<br>","byline":"Karen McVeigh","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bdf1d0589fe52cb8f58405dc4efff76a6b72a8e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bdf1d0589fe52cb8f58405dc4efff76a6b72a8e8/0_0_3305_1983/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cliffs below Flamborough Head on the Yorkshire coast.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Flamborough Head on the Yorkshire coast, one of the sites recommended for greater protections by environmental groups.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Thompson/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>The UK government has announced plans to increase protection of wildlife and habitats by banning fishing and other damaging activities from a handful of selected marine sites off the coast of England.</p> <p>More than 97% of British offshore marine protected areas (MPAs), designed to safeguard habitats and biodiversity, are being dredged and bottom trawled, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/oct/09/revealed-97-of-uk-offshore-marine-parks-subject-to-destructive-fishing\">according to data published by the Guardian</a>.

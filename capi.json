Out it fizzed, and Adam Lyth guided the ball off his hip and into the waiting hands of Luke Wells at leg slip. The first “Oh Lanky Lanky” since 2019 trilled over Old Trafford as Lyth stalked towards the dressing room.</p> <p>Seven overs later, the penultimate of the day, Saqib Mahmood hurtled in off his long, long run and pinned Tom Kohler-Cadmore in front of the stumps. Mahmood punched the air while Kohler-Cadmore slumped back off, followed shortly afterwards by a clatter that sounded very much like a bat being thumped repeatedly against a wall.</p> <p>Their frustration was understandable: Kohler-Cadmore and Lyth had batted for 38 of the 47 overs <strong>Yorkshire </strong>had to survive in the day, risking sending the masses into a stupor with their dedication and application to the task at hand: batting for the rest of Saturday and the whole of Sunday. They so nearly did it.</p> <p>It was Josh Bohannon, with the help of Danny Lamb, who had set Lancashire up for the kill, moving to the second Championship century of his career and his first Roses hundred slow-quick-slow – which was just what was needed. Wickets came as Lancashire upped the ante before the declaration, but by then the lead was 350.</p> <p>Yorkshire’s woes won’t have been helped by <strong>Northamptonshire</strong>’s progress down at Hove. With a win in touching distance, they will leapfrog Yorkshire to second place in Division Two. Despite a game second innings by <strong>Sussex</strong>, which included a hundred by Tom Haines and 95 for Ben Brown as well as five wickets for Simon Kerrigan, Northants were set just 218 to win. By stumps, they needed only 87 more with eight wickets in hand.</p> <p><strong>Essex</strong> beat <strong>Durham</strong> by 195 runs in an lbw-fest at The Riverside after Peter Siddle and Jamie Porter made mincemeat of their middle and late order. Durham lost five for 38 as the sun slipped down the sky, Alex Lees working hard for his 48. When Jack Burnham became the 19th player to be given out lbw, it was a record in an English first-class match.</p> <p>Daniel Moriarty took his fourth five-wicket haul of his short first-class career, bowling <strong>Gloucestershire</strong> into a hole at The Oval. The <strong>Surrey</strong> bowler took six for 60, and Amar Virdi three for 46, in the first innings, as Gloucestershire were bundled out for 158, with only Miles Hammond in a four-hour 77 providing any bulk to the batting.</p> <p>Following on, meanwhile, Hammond found himself at the crease sooner than he might have hoped and was unbeaten again on 38 at the close, but Gloucester are still 191 behind with just five wickets left.</p> <p>Career-best bowling from Dillon Pennington gave <strong>Worcestershire</strong> the upper hand at New Road. Pennington snaffled four for 44 in the first innings then three for 25 in the next as <strong>Derbyshire</strong> were invited to follow on and crumbled.</p> <p><strong>Leicestershire</strong> need an unlikely 303 to win against <strong>Middlesex</strong> on a turning pitch. Chris Wright had whistled through Middlesex earlier with six for 48.</p> <p>An intriguing final last day lies in wait at Edgbaston as <strong>Warwickshire</strong> and <strong>Nottinghamshire </strong>went nose to nose. Fifties for Michael Burgess and Will Rhodes inched Warwickshire to a lead of 245 by stumps.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60b348698f088d8c3178d773\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-05-30T09:22:53.974Z\">10.22am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>A most beautiful May morning, </strong>the sky milky-eyed blue, the air full of blossom and Paul Allot in his shorts.

Northants 256 and 218-7 beat Sussex 175 and 298 This makes it very tasty! More runs for Saif Zaib, 47; Rob Keogh, 60. Northants confirmed in third place in Group 3 with 97 points. Northants trilling merrily on their way - just 19 needed now; while Warwickshire bat on - 250-7 - a lead of 294. Bat on till 2.30 before the declaration? Worcestershire 421 beat Derbyshire 270 and 128 by an innings and 23 runs. Pennington finishes with five - and nine in the match. Only three batsmen in double figures for Derbyshire in a sorry second innings. Just the ticket. Parky replaces Tom Bailey at the Brian Statham End. Meanwhile, Gloucestershire are crumbling, losing their glue, Hammond, to Moriarty for 45 before Smith bowled by Joverton for one. At 148-7, they need 167 to make Surrey bat again. A forlorn hope. Should they lose, Lancashire will be the only team in the Championship with an unbeaten record. The off stump The middle stump... Another for Mahmood! This time it moves away, away and ping the off stump flies! Beautifull. Yorkshire 92-4. A beauty from Saqib Mahmood! A fast inswinger that plucks Fraine’s middle stump and sends it flying. Fraine turns his bat the wrong way round and plods off, the second time in the match he’s had an unplayable ball from Mahmood. Yorkshire 87-3. That man Pennington again! Fourth of the innings, eighth of the match. Derbyshire 188-8, still 33 behind Leicestershire lose their first wicket of the day and it is Sam Evans, who gives John Simpsom some catching practise. Tom Helm pockets his first of the innings and Leics are 85-2. A wicket too soon. A fizzing opening ball from Mahmood which Fraine leaves with an eye-brow raising boldness. The players are out, Patterson pressing forward, forward, forward with his bat as he walks. Mahmood has the ball from the James Anderson end. It has just been pointed out to me that Northants will NOT leap on top of Yorkshire if they win... apologies. If Yorks lose today they will have 99 points; and if Northants win they will have 97. We know Jimmy Anderson would have preferred to take his 1000th wicket at the Roses match, but needs must. Vic over a morning coffee: heaven. Group One Riverside: ESSEX 182 and 301 BEAT DURHAM 99 and 189 by 195 runs Edgbaston: Warwickshire 341 all out and 201-6 v Nottinghamshire 297 New Road: Worcestershire 421 all out v Derbyshire 270 and 112-6 Group Two Grace Road: Leicestershire 136 and 75-1 Middlesex 295 and 218 all out Leicestershire need 303 to win The Oval: Surrey 473 all out v Gloucestershire 158 and 124-5 Group Three Old Trafford: Lancashire 509-9dec v Yorkshire 159 and 85-2 Hove: Sussex 175 and 298 v Northants 256 and 131-2 Northants need 87 to win His shadow lolling out to the right, a white flannel tucked into the waistband of his trousers and his cropped hair gleaming in the sun, Lancashire’s Matt Parkinson ripped a ball into the rough. Out it fizzed, and Adam Lyth guided the ball off his hip and into the waiting hands of Luke Wells at leg slip. The first “Oh Lanky Lanky” since 2019 trilled over Old Trafford as Lyth stalked towards the dressing room. Seven overs later, the penultimate of the day, Saqib Mahmood hurtled in off his long, long run and pinned Tom Kohler-Cadmore in front of the stumps. Mahmood punched the air while Kohler-Cadmore slumped back off, followed shortly afterwards by a clatter that sounded very much like a bat being thumped repeatedly against a wall. Their frustration was understandable: Kohler-Cadmore and Lyth had batted for 38 of the 47 overs Yorkshire had to survive in the day, risking sending the masses into a stupor with their dedication and application to the task at hand: batting for the rest of Saturday and the whole of Sunday. They so nearly did it. It was Josh Bohannon, with the help of Danny Lamb, who had set Lancashire up for the kill, moving to the second Championship century of his career and his first Roses hundred slow-quick-slow – which was just what was needed. Wickets came as Lancashire upped the ante before the declaration, but by then the lead was 350. Yorkshire’s woes won’t have been helped by Northamptonshire’s progress down at Hove. With a win in touching distance, they will leapfrog Yorkshire to second place in Division Two. Despite a game second innings by Sussex, which included a hundred by Tom Haines and 95 for Ben Brown as well as five wickets for Simon Kerrigan, Northants were set just 218 to win. By stumps, they needed only 87 more with eight wickets in hand. Essex beat Durham by 195 runs in an lbw-fest at The Riverside after Peter Siddle and Jamie Porter made mincemeat of their middle and late order. Durham lost five for 38 as the sun slipped down the sky, Alex Lees working hard for his 48. When Jack Burnham became the 19th player to be given out lbw, it was a record in an English first-class match. Daniel Moriarty took his fourth five-wicket haul of his short first-class career, bowling Gloucestershire into a hole at The Oval. The Surrey bowler took six for 60, and Amar Virdi three for 46, in the first innings, as Gloucestershire were bundled out for 158, with only Miles Hammond in a four-hour 77 providing any bulk to the batting. Following on, meanwhile, Hammond found himself at the crease sooner than he might have hoped and was unbeaten again on 38 at the close, but Gloucester are still 191 behind with just five wickets left. Career-best bowling from Dillon Pennington gave Worcestershire the upper hand at New Road. Pennington snaffled four for 44 in the first innings then three for 25 in the next as Derbyshire were invited to follow on and crumbled. Leicestershire need an unlikely 303 to win against Middlesex on a turning pitch. Chris Wright had whistled through Middlesex earlier with six for 48. An intriguing final last day lies in wait at Edgbaston as Warwickshire and Nottinghamshire went nose to nose. Fifties for Michael Burgess and Will Rhodes inched Warwickshire to a lead of 245 by stumps. A most beautiful May morning, the sky milky-eyed blue, the air full of blossom and Paul Allot in his shorts. Here at Old Trafford, a thriller awaits as Yorkshire attempt to bat out the day and Lancashire, with Parky whirling and Mahmood charging, press for the kill. Elsewhere, Northants should knock off the runs this morning; Leicester have to defy the might of Middlesex; at The Oval Miles Hammond lies between Surrey and victory; Worcestershire are on course to roll-over Derbyshire and a close match awaits at Edgbaston.","charCount":"7610","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/tanyaaldred\">Tanya Aldred</a> at Old Trafford"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/live/2021/may/30/covid-live-news-uk-lockdown-ending-date-keir-starmer-boris-johnson-australia-new-zealand-india-variant-coronavirus","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-30T11:56:35Z","webTitle":"Covid live news: UK considering compulsory vaccination for NHS staff; Malaysia to increase immunisation efforts ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2021/may/30/covid-live-news-uk-lockdown-ending-date-keir-starmer-boris-johnson-australia-new-zealand-india-variant-coronavirus","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2021/may/30/covid-live-news-uk-lockdown-ending-date-keir-starmer-boris-johnson-australia-new-zealand-india-variant-coronavirus","fields":{"headline":"Covid live news: UK considering compulsory vaccination for NHS staff; Malaysia to increase immunisation efforts ","standfirst":"<p>Latest updates: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2021/may/30/covid-live-news-uk-lockdown-ending-date-keir-starmer-boris-johnson-australia-new-zealand-india-variant-coronavirus?page=with:block-60b34a0e8f08d486a771760b#block-60b34a0e8f08d486a771760b\">UK government considering mandatory jabs for health workers</a>; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2021/may/30/covid-live-news-uk-lockdown-ending-date-keir-starmer-boris-johnson-australia-new-zealand-india-variant-coronavirus?page=with:block-60b342668f086d71cc15efd6#block-60b342668f086d71cc15efd6\">Malaysia to set up more mega vaccination centres</a></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/may/29/keir-starmer-boris-johnsons-chaos-could-hit-june-plan-to-lift-lockdown\">Keir Starmer: Boris Johnson’s chaos could hit June plan to lift lockdown</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul>","trailText":"Latest updates: UK government considering mandatory jabs for health workers; Malaysia to set up more mega vaccination centres","byline":"Caroline Davies","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"237a4ea09ddf9a90716c55143bcae6a72f4b5f8f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/237a4ea09ddf9a90716c55143bcae6a72f4b5f8f/0_360_5399_3239/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People sitting outside drinking and eating al fresco in Margate, Kent.

South Korea has reported a lower death toll than many comparable developed countries from Covid-19, but the government has come under criticism for a comparatively slow rollout of vaccines, Reuters reports. Less than 11% of its 52 million people have so far received a first dose. US President Joe Biden, at his first summit with President Moon Jae-in earlier this month, promised to supply 550,000 shots for South Korean troops. Kim said that offer had now been increased to 1m doses, and the shots will arrive this week. On care homes, UK vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi today defended the government approach. Boris Johnson’s former aide Dominic Cummings claimed the health secretary, Matt Hancock, had lied to the prime minister over tests being carried out on those discharged into care homes – a charge denied by Hancock. Zahawi said the government had made the best use of the limited testing capacity available when the pandemic struck and it had put a “protective ring” around care homes. Asked whether Hancock had promised care home residents would be tested before discharge from hospital, Zahawi told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: Matt Hancock was very much focused on delivery, I think it’s worth putting this in context … in the sense that in the eye of the storm, we were only able to do 2,000 tests a day. The diagnostics industry was almost non-existent in the UK. He added Hancock had said that “people going into care homes absolutely should be tested and the system, the NHS, operationalised that” as testing capacity increased. Asked why people had been sent home without tests, Zahawi said “hindsight is a wonderful thing”, adding: We can sit here and sort of argue the toss about asymptomatic transmission … and when we really knew about that. The whole point is you use every resource available to you, to the best of your ability, to save and to protect as many people as possible. There have been more than 36,275 deaths involving Covid-19 in care homes since the pandemic began. Zahawi said: When the inquiry is held, and we will look at all these things in detail, we will of course examine where we could do better. But to say that we didn’t deal with them to the best of our capability, with the resources that were available to us, is a mistake, is wrong. Italy has extended an entry ban for people coming from India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, as a continued precaution against the more transmissible Indian variant. The ban, which does not apply to Italian citizens, was introduced in late April and was due to expire on Sunday. It was prolonged until 21 June, a spokesman for Italian health minister Roberto Speranza said in a statement. Care homes were “forgotten” during the “dreadful” early stages of the Covid pandemic in the UK, a sector leader has said. Mike Padgham, the chairman of the Independent Care Group, which represents providers in York and North Yorkshire, told Sky News it had been a “frightening” time for staff and residents. Padgham was questioned in relation to the claim made by former Downing Street adviser Dominic Cummings to MPs this week that suggestions care homes were shielded were “complete nonsense”. Padgham said: I don’t believe myself there was a ring of protection thrown round us. In those very early days it was difficult. We were forgotten. We’ve been forgotten over decades. That’s the only issue in social care. We weren’t prepared. We weren’t ready. We didn’t have the PPE, we didn’t have the testing. And it took the government many, many weeks to actually see what was happening in homes, despite our best efforts and protestations. That is why providers … without their efforts, the figures … would have been much worse.” Vietnam’s business hub Ho Chi Minh City will begin social distancing measures in the city for 15 days starting from Monday in an effort to curb the spread of the coronavirus, according to the state-run Tuoi Tre newspaper reported on Sunday. “All events that gather more than 10 people in public are banned city-wide, but the city is considering to lower the number of people to just five,” the newspaper reported.“While all citizens of Go Vap district are not allowed to go out if not necessary,” the report added. Ho Chi Minh City earlier this week shut down shops and restaurants. A leading scientist has called for stallholders at the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan to be interviewed in any further investigation of the Covid-19 epidemic. Dr Eddie Holmes has joined a growing chorus of voices calling for further investigation into the source of the pandemic. The US president, Joe Biden, has ordered the US intelligence community to intensify its efforts to study the origins of coronavirus, as the theory that the virus might have come from a lab in Wuhan gains traction. He revealed that two of the 18 intelligence agencies are leaning towards the animal link and one leans more toward the lab theory. It is still thought by many that the market in Wuhan is at the centre of the Covid-19 breakout and that the virus jumped from an animal species to humans. On 31 January 2021, a team of scientists led by the World Health Organization visited the market. However, according to their report only two stall operators were interviewed, and neither was engaged in trading wildlife. Edward Holmes, an expert in the evolution and emergence of infectious diseases at the University of Sydney, who saw live wildlife being traded at the Huanan market in 2014, said: “As wildlife present the greatest risk, this should have been the priority in the WHO’s investigation of the market. “However, I’m not sure who controlled the WHO’s schedule so it may have been out of their hands,” he added. “At the very least these stallholders need to be reinterviewed in any additional investigation into the virus origins.” Taiwan reported 355 domestic Covid-19 cases on Sunday. After recording just a handful of daily infections for months, Taiwan is dealing with relatively large numbers of community transmissions, though infection rates are starting to fall. It has only vaccinated around 1% of its more than 23 million people but has almost 30 million shots on order, from AstraZeneca Plc, Moderna Inc and two domestic firms. The UK government is waiting for the latest data on June 14 before deciding whether to proceed with easing the lockdown on June 21, vaccine minister Nadhim Zahawi said. Asked whether that step could be taken if cases were still increasing, he told BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show: What I’m saying to you is we have to be cautious. We have to look at the data and share it with the country. Are we still vaccinating at scale? Big tick. Are the vaccines working? Yes. But are infection rates too high for us to then not be able to proceed because there are too many people getting into hospital? I don’t know the answer to it. But we will know it on, hopefully on the 14th, a few more weeks. He said that as the virus becomes endemic “we’re going to have to live with a certain amount of Covid being transmitted”. On the possible compulsory vaccination of NHS staff in the UK, Labour’s shadow cabinet minister Thangam Debbonaire, said “threatening” NHS staff to have the vaccine was not a good idea. The shadow Commons leader told Sky News: Given we have got a recruitment crisis in parts of the NHS I think it’s far more important we try and work with staff rather than against them. Threatening staff, I don’t think is a good idea.” Public Health England and the NHS had been successful when they had worked with people to address their doubts and answer questions about the jab, she said. I would like to see the government work with the NHS and social care staff. More on the question of vaccinating children, one expert has said that the emergence of new variants could influence the decision in the UK. Professor Peter Openshaw, a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), told Times Radio that there were “debates” about the possible risks of “very, very rare complications” associated with vaccination, which had to be balanced against the “certainty” that someone can get “very severe complications” by catching Covid. Speaking in a personal capacity, he added: It may well be that actually giving children vaccines will become a clearer option once we know more about the disease in children and whether the new variants are spreading further into the paediatric population and causing more significant disease. That could certainly change the risk-benefit ratio.” Prof Openshaw said the UK placed an emphasis on “public health benefits” and therefore “vaccinating those who may be transmitting disease, sometimes unknowingly, is a perfectly good justification for vaccination”. He added: The new variants extending further down the age range and being of quite high prevalence even in children as young as four, it may be that actually children and school children are going to be a more important part of the transmission chain as the virus becomes more transmissible as new variants arise. So... the benefits might change and that might affect the decision about whether to vaccinate children in the future. British regulators were still considering whether to offer jabs to children, UK vaccine minister Nadhim Zahawi told Sky News: Our own regulator has not yet approved giving vaccines to children. You have to make sure the vaccines are incredibly safe before you give them to children. The Pfizer jab has been approved for use in 12-year-olds by regulators in the European Union, US and Canada and Zahawi said the “infrastructure” was in place to jab children in the UK if required. But he said the issue was complicated because the main benefits of the jab were not necessarily felt by children themselves but instead by those around them. He said: On the whole you are vaccinating to protect their families and their communities and the country. UK vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi confirmed the government was considering whether coronavirus jabs should be compulsory for NHS staff. He told Sky News: It’s absolutely the right thing and it would be incumbent on any responsible government to have the debate, to do the thinking as to how we go about protecting the most vulnerable by making sure that those who look after them are vaccinated. There is precedent for this, obviously surgeons get vaccinated for hepatitis B, so it’s something that we are absolutely thinking about. He also said that the World Health Organisation investigation must be able to fully investigate the origins of the pandemic. The Sunday Times reported that British agents believe it is “feasible” that the crisis began with a coronavirus leak from a Chinese research laboratory in Wuhan. Asked about the report, Zahawi said: I think it’s really important that the WHO is allowed to conduct its investigation unencumbered into the origins of this pandemic and that we should leave no stone unturned to understand why - not only because of the current pandemic that has swept the world but also for future-proofing the world’s capability to deal with pandemics. Russia reported 9,694 new cases on Sunday, the highest number since the end of March, which took the national tally to 5,063,442 infections. The Russian coronavirus task force said that 355 more deaths of Covid-19 patients were confirmed in the past 24 hours, bringing the official death toll to 121,162. The federal statistics agency has kept a separate count and has said Russia recorded around 250,000 deaths related to Covid-19 from April 2020 to March 2021, Reuters reports. The British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) chief executive Emma McClarkin has called on the UK government to provide advance notice to businesses if restrictions are to remain after June 21. McClarkin acknowledged the government was in a “difficult situation” but said Whitehall had to “stick to its road map”. She told BBC Breakfast: We need the Government to stick to its road map of removing those restrictions by the 21st of June if we want to see the great British pub really begin its recovery. What I need to say is June 21 is absolutely critical to the recovery of the sector. Recovery day only starts when the restrictions are removed. If the Government does leave any lingering restrictions in play then they really need to give us advance notice of that and it needs to talk seriously about financial compensation. But right now we are asking the Government to stick to their road map. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 3,852 to 3,679,148, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Sunday. The reported death toll rose by 56 to 88,406, the tally showed. Malaysia is planning to set up more mega vaccination centres and get private doctors to join immunisation efforts, after five consecutive days of record daily coronavirus infections, Reuters reports. Science minister Khairy Jamaluddin told a virtual news briefing on Sunday that the government will set up another five mega vaccination centres around the capital, Kuala Lumpur, and are considering two in the northen state of Penang and in the southern state of Johor. Nearly 6% of the country’s 32 million people have been vaccinated, according to the website of the governmental Special Committee for Ensuring Access to COVID-19 Vaccine Supply. Khairy said the government is also looking to allow drive-through vaccination centres in the country, after guidelines are firmed up. Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin on Friday announced a nationwide total lockdown from June 1-14 in an effort to curb the spread of the virus. Malaysia reported 6,999 new cases on Sunday, bringing the total infections in the country to 565,533. More than half of people in their 30s in England have received a coronavirus vaccination in a period of little over two weeks, new figures reveal. NHS England said that, since it began opening up the vaccine rollout to this age group on May 13, 53% of those aged 30 to 39 have been given at least one dose. The data comes as Prof Stephen Reicher, a psychologist on the Sage sub-committee advising ministers on behavioural science, said the government was in a “pickle” because it appeared to have abandoned the “data not dates” principle. The NHS, meanwhile, is asking people aged 50 and older, as well as those who are clinically vulnerable, to bring forward their second Covid-19 vaccination to help combat the spread of the B1.617.2 variant first identified in India. It follows the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) recommending earlier this month that the second dose interval be shortened from 12 weeks to eight for people in priority cohorts. India today reported its lowest daily rise in new coronavirus infections in 46 days at 165,553 cases during the previous 24 hours, while deaths rose by 3,460. The south Asian nation’s tally of infections now stands at 27.9m, with a death toll of 325,972, health ministry data showed on Sunday. Good morning, and welcome to the coronavirus global blog.

Do we got ourselves a ball-game? Kecmanovic 1-6 2-0 Evans Kecmanovic is making a game of the games now, but he’s still getting absolutely served; Evans, who beat Djokovic at Monte Carlo last month, is looking lovely and takes the first set in short order. Kecmanovic 1-6 Evans Back on Chatrier, Andujar had a break-back point against Thiem but failed to convert; he’s on the baord, though, 2-1 down in set one. Kecmanovic fights hard in the sixth game of the match and he’s in it now, a banging forehand down the line resolving a succession of deuces. Kecmanovic 1-5 Evans On court seven, Roberto Bautista Agut – the number 11 seed – is underway. If he’d played in the 80s or 90s he might’ve won one of these in the way that Muster, Bruguera, Gomez, Moya and Kafelnikov all did. But here we are. He trials Vilella Martinez 4-3 on serve. Meanwhile, on Chatrier, a dominant first game from Thiem sees him break Andujar. Evans has got into stride quickly here and looks to have Kecmanovic’s number. There’s not much pop on the Serb’s serve which is allowing yerman to climb right into points, and this first set is almost over. Kecmanovic 0-4 Evans Fognini has beaten Barrera 4,1 and 4. The number 27 seed plays Simon or, more likely, Fucsovics next. Those two tussle on Mathieu presently; Kovinivic has done for Burel 6-3 7-6(8) and must now contemplate Osaka. Anyhow, while I was busy wondering what my girlfriend wife would say if I publicly challenged her ability to have it, Evans was busy holding and breaking. Kecmanovic 0-2 Evans Just last week, Thiem noted that living in a bubble has helped Evans, given he’s previously struggled with the demands of the professional athlete’s lifestyle; Evans was having none of it, retorting that he’d sorted himself well before the pandemic started. “I must be out partying a lot, yeah,” he said. “I’ve done all right outside of the bubble as well. I must have improved a lot inside it for him to say that. I travel with my girlfriend every week. It’s not like you can go out partying with your girlfriend every week. It’s not that I was on my own and single and going nuts when there weren’t bubbles. It’s a strange comment, isn’t it?” Evans and Kecmanovic are knocking up.... Next on Chatrier: the number four seed and defeated finalist in 2018 and 2019, Dominic Thiem, begins his next assault on the trophy. He meets Pablo Andujar. A couple more results: in the men’s competition, Carreno Busta has rinsed Gombos 3,4, and 3, whole in the women’s, Tomljanovic has sorted Kozlova 2 and 4. Osaka hasn’t played a lot lately but she looked pretty good today. I don’t think her footwork is good enough to win here – yet – but her ball-striking was on-point and the relative closeness of the match is down to how well Tig played. Osaka meets Bogdan next. Osaka hollers a come on as she makes 4-2 in the breaker – the ball makes such a lush thump off the middle of her forehand. An error from Tig quickly gives her 5-2 ... but consecutive unforced errors and we’re back on serve. Briefly. Here ceom two more match points.... Next on court six, we’ve got Dan Evans, the British number one, against Minomir Kecmanovic. She meets Burel or Kovinivic next; Kovinivic won the first set 6-3 and it’s 2-2 in the second. Tig is competing hard here, but with a point for a breaker clips over another second serve of questionable power and Osaka quickly punishes. She may well regret that ... but no! A forehand clattered down the line saves the match point that follows, and a fine kicker helps her raise advantage, ceded when an inside-out forehand drops marginally wide ... but what a lob she finds when in front the next time! Tig 4-6 6-6 Osaka Fognini has taken that second set against Barrere to lead 6-4 6-1 1-0 (with a break). On court six, Badosa and Davis are playing a breaker in a topsy-turvy second set; Badosa won the first. But look at Kalinina! She reels off two points in short order and it turns out you can’t loz the first five games of a set and expect to win. She meets Collins or Wang next; Wang has just levelled the match at one set all. ...and Kerber saves it with a glorious backhand slice drop-shot! Egalité! Osaka is whacking it hard now, but Tig is just about sticking with her, while Kalinina finds a devastating forehand to give herself 30-0 against Kerber; she’s nearly there. Back to Chatrier, Tig misses a huge chance with a half-court volley that would’ve got her 15-30; seconds later, the game has gone and Osaka, 5-4 up in the second, needs just one more. Kerber, meanwhile, soon makes 30-all; Kalinina steps on the spot to try and shake her tightness, then serves a double. Eesh. She makes deuce though, then hits through the ball beautifully to raise match point... Fognini is bolting; the number 27 seed came from behind to take the first set of Barrere, but now leads 4-1 in the second. A monstrous forehand down the line breaks Kalinina to 15; it’s taken a while but Kerber is motoring. Still, the qualifier will have one more chance to eject her before we’re back on serve – but first, Kerber must hold. Kalinina 6-2 5-3 Kerber Tig is hanging in there well, but Osaka holds for 3-2, while Kerber has won a second game and Kalinina will now serve for the match a second time. At change of ends, she puts a towel over her head to get into the correct frame of mind. Pablo Carreno Busta, the number 12 seed and a clay-court specialist, has taken set two against Norbert Gombos; he now leads 6-3 6-4 0-1. Kerber has won a game! Kalinina now leads 6-2 5-1. Some reading on Edberg. Goodness me, Tig just dispensed the weakest second serve I’ve ever seen, short, skipping up off the clay, and duly marmalised by Osaka. In commentary, they reckon Sampras had the best second-serve in men’s history – shout from me for Edberg’s kicker – and Durie mentions Barty in the women’s game. Anyhow, Tig survives a break point to hold. Tig 4-6 2-2 It took a while, but Fognini has fought back to take the first set from Barrere, 6-4; Kalinina now leads Kerber – who’s won every major but this one – 6-2 4-0. Tossing those opportunities has not not gone down well with Osaka, who powers through a break to love, seizing the first set and sealing it with a colossal forehand racing forward. Tig 4-6 Osaka Updates from the women’s side: Kozlova 2-6 Tomljanovic, Cocciaretto 1-6 2-3 Bogdan, Collins 6-2 1-1 Wang Have a look! Kalinina breaks Kerber in the first game of the second set and quickly consolidates, while a double fault helps Tig earn a break-back point; Osaka impatiently whips a forehand long, and we’re back on serve! Tig 4-5 Osaka Tig saves three set points, forcing Osaka to serve for the first set, while Badosa has taken hers against Davis, 6-2. When they’re done on court six, Dan Evans will have a go; he plays the Serb, Miomir Kecmanović. Kerber couldn’t do enough, and after a succession of deuces during which she saved a set point with a net cord, Kalinina comes through 6-2. Carreno Busta, the number 12 seed, has rinsed through the first set against Gombos 6-3 and now trails 0-1 in the second, on serve; I’m not quite sure how they’ve managed 10 games so quickly, but they have. By way of comparison, Barrere leads Fognini 3-2, still with the break he took early doors. Osaka isn’t a natural mover on clay but she’s hitting it very nicely indeed, especially with feet planted. She’s won 15 out of 16 on serve, and her second straight love-game leaves her close to the first set. Tig 2-5 Osaka Yeah, time’s up. Kerber has roused herself to claw back a break. It might not save this set for her, but if she maintains her current level, she’ll be reet. Kalinina 5-2 Kerber Out of the corner of my eye, I’m also watching Paula Badosa, the number 33 seed, playing Lauren Davis; Badosa is a Manhattan-born Spaniard and won the girls’ singles in 2015. She’s looking good out there, leading 4-2. Elsewhere, Bogdan has taken the first set against Cocciaretto, 6-1; Fognini is a break down to Barrere; and Tomljanovic leads Kozlova 3-0. It’s all going wrong for Kerber, who now trails Kalinina 5-0. Under an umbrella – what a lovely sight that is – she takes some deep breaths while having a serious word with herself. Yeah, Osaka is grooving, greeting a decent first serve with a belter of a cross-court return to raise break point. But Tig yanks her in and Osaka stutter-slides in to botch a slice of her own ... but no matter. She’s piecing Tig up here, and a booming forehand nails her fourth advantage. Tig 0-2 Osaka I’m also watching Angelique Kerber, who’s not a great clay artist and is 0-2 down to Anhelina Kalinina, the qualifer. Meanwhile, on Chatrier, Jo Durie discusses how brilliant the current standard of women’s tennis is, and she’s right. I suppose I might slightly disagree, she’ll be devo’d to learn, because there’s no dominant champion at the peak of their powers. Perhaps Osaka will be become that, but otherwise there are so many who are so good, and when you stick on a match you’ve not a clue what’s going to happen, and that’s a beautiful thing. I’m really looking forward to seeing the improvements Osaka has made on clay, and she saves a break point in the opening game of the match. Tig 0-1 Osaka. On Chatrier, Naomi Osaka will be underway in une minute. Here’s Tumaini Carayol on her big call. Well, on the show courts - there’s plenty else besides. Chatrier Tig v Osaka [2] Andujar v Thiem [4] Azarenka [15] v Kuznetsova Tsitsipas [5] v Chardy Lenglen Fognini [27] v Barrere Minnen [Q] v Kvitova [11] Konjuh [Q] v Sabalneka [3] Zverev [6] v Otte [Q] Mathieu Burel v Kovinivic Fucsovics v Simon Moutet v Djere Dodin v Keys [23] It’s been an enervating, affirming winter slog, but we made it, and with the first ball tossed this morning, the summer of sport – the ridiculous summer of sport – is upon us. And you can be absolutely certain that we’ll take it. Most importantly, each of the show courts will house up to 1000 fans a day for each of the first 10 days – and hopefully more thereafter. They, like the rest of us, will be wondering whether this, finally, is the year that Rafael Nadal finally runs out of road; Novak Djokovic, Dominic Thiem, Stefanos Tsitsipas and Daniil Medvedev will be hoping so, but it will only be a hope. Meanwhile and as has become the fashion – sorry, le mode – no one has a clue what’ll happen in the women’s side. Iga Swiatek is the defending champion and if she hits a vein she’ll be hard to stop, but there are just so many others who might do likewise that anyone who thinks they know is lying. I cannot wait.

The <a href=\"https://www.rspb.org.uk/\" title=\"\">RSPB</a> reported a 70% increase in visitors to its website during the first lockdown. This came as no surprise to me; stuck at home, without the usual distraction of social engagement, my interest in nature grew. During the winter, I would look up into leafless trees trying to locate a bird whose loud call I could clearly hear. I even bought myself a pair of binoculars so I could acquaint myself with some of the local avian population.</p> <p>But now I have a new hobby. As the warmer weather slowly arrives, I have been lowering my gaze towards the stirring flower beds and roadside verges, as well as rustling in the undergrowth in the hope of spotting my favourite insects. On a sunny day, there’s nothing better than sitting quietly by a patch of swaying flowers or under a blossoming tree to listen for the tell-tale sign of buzzing. This quintessential sound of summer connects me to the seasons and the natural world, even in the inner city, and fills me with joy. It is also a welcome break from staring at a screen all day. I wait peacefully, in anticipation and excitement of seeing different types of bees.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Bees act as a crucial romantic go-between for much of our flora</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The evocatively named hairy-footed flower bee is one of the easiest to spot. She noisily darts among the clumps of lungwort (pulmonaria) that I’ve planted to attract her. Large and round with a velvety black body, she has a distinctive hovering movement and flies rather comically with her long, straw-like tongue outstretched in preparation for reaching deep inside bell-shaped flowers to extract their nectar. When she rests on a leaf, the hairs on her fluffy brown back legs are clearly visible, right down to her feet – hence her name.</p> <p>My curiosity in bees was awakened a few years ago when I had to give up beekeeping after developing an allergy to honeybee venom. Until then I had been fascinated with the workings of a managed bee hive, but ignorant of the myriad bee species that live in the wild.</p> <p>I had no idea there were so many and that they came in so many shapes, sizes and hues. I assumed all bees were black and yellow striped. But with a little patience and field guides for assistance, my eyes slowly began to open to a whole new world. It was as if I had gone on an incredible journey without leaving my garden. Even better, few of these wild bees sting, so I feel perfectly safe observing them at close quarters. And I have found that the simple pleasure of seeing something in nature and learning how to identify it is immensely gratifying.</p> <p>There is much research about the positive impact on our mental health of spending time in nature. The Pulitzer prize-winning biologist EO Wilson believes that humans have an innate and genetically determined affinity with the natural world, a concept he calls biophilia, which literally means a love of living things. But our modern, urban indoor lives, often cut off from the changing seasons, have stifled it. In his 2019 book <em>Bird Therapy</em>, Joe Harkness writes about how ornithology saved his life. He links it to five ways to improve wellbeing: connect, learn, be active, give, and take notice. From my experience, they are all equally applicable to melittology – the study of bees.</p> <p>Research into bees has tended to focus on their role in pollinating most of our food crops, especially those providing essential vitamins and minerals. Professor Alexandra-Maria Klein’s research at Germany’s Freiburg University also points to the wild plants and trees pollinated by bees which support our health in urban areas through air filtration and reducing the temperature among the concrete and glass. But no one seems to have examined the wellbeing attained by just stopping and taking time to notice foraging bees.</p> <p>When you see a bee visiting a flower you are witnessing a love affair that began more than 100m years ago, when plants evolved brightly coloured petals and fragrant scents. Their beauty and rich perfumes were solely designed to lure pollinators by advertising the sugary drink that lurked deep within their nectaries. Bees need nectar to fuel their flight (and turn into honey in the case of honeybees) and pollen to feed their larvae. In return for meeting their dietary requirements, bees act as a romantic go-between for the world’s flora, transporting enough pollen from the male part of the flower to the female to allow them to produce seeds and reproduce. No one describes this symbiotic relationship better than the poet Kahlil Gibran, who wrote: “To the bee, a flower is the fountain of life, and to the flower the bee is a messenger of love.”</p> <p>For me, a bee on a flower is no longer just a bee, but now has a name, both a common and a Latin one, which can often provide a clue to their favourite flowers, and how they construct their nests. Mining bees make burrows underground to lay their eggs in, leaf-cutter bees plug their nests with circular pieces of leaves – often cut from a rose bush and leaving it looking as if it has been attacked with a hole-punch. Carpenter bees fashion their nests from wood.</p> <p>Every year I hope to spot a few more of the 250-plus wild bee species in the UK. Many are small and brown, making them difficult to distinguish from each other; some are so tiny they are hardly visible to the naked eye, while others are restricted to rare coastal habitats. According to <a href=\"https://friendsoftheearth.uk/\" title=\"\">Friends of the Earth</a>, at least 35 are endangered (including a quarter of our bumblebee species) due to habitat loss and widespread pesticide use. Since 1945, 97% of our wildflower meadows have been lost to intensive agriculture and urbanisation. Yet some bees are thriving in towns and cities where gardens, tree-lined avenues and parks can provide an abundant and varied diet.</p> <p>I have tried to create Yeats’s “bee-loud glade” in my small urban garden by planting flowers that bloom sequentially, so there is always something for dinner, from early spring to late autumn. Bowl-shaped and daisy-style flowers for the short-tongued bees and pendulous ones for the longer-tongued, like the garden bumblebee. I love watching her disappearing deep inside a foxglove only to reappear moments later cloaked in pollen grains.</p> <p>I may not be physically active when observing these interactions, but creating suitable bee habitat provides plenty of outdoor exercise. Under the south-facing eaves of our garden shed, my husband has installed a series of manmade bee hotels (which contain hollow tubes where bees can check-in to lay their eggs). Each year, just as our apple tree is bursting into blossom, I hear the humming of a new generation of red mason bees checking out. This synchronicity between the apple tree and its loyal pollinator reassures me that all is well with the world – at least in my tiny corner of it.</p> <p>As the summer progresses, I’ll be captivated by the industriousness of the wool carder bee as she teases out the fibres from the soft leaves of the lamb’s ear plant. She will roll them into a ball nearly as big as herself and fly it home to partition and plug her nest.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I have launched a newsletter with tips for identifying bees and how to help them</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Since I started my bee journey I have shared my enthusiasm for these wondrous creatures and my discoveries about them in books, talks and educational materials. This year, with the help of the amazing insect photographer, Penny Metal, I am posting <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alison_urbanbees/\" title=\"\">bee-spotter guides</a> on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alisonurbanbees\" title=\"\">social media</a> and I have launched a <a href=\"https://urbanbees.us3.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=a0a11e3b138412c76500c333b&amp;id=c76d101f4d\" title=\"\">newsletter</a> with tips for identifying bees and how to help them.</p> <p>Now that we can start to see our friends and family again, I’m not about to give up my hobby. I have put my skills to good use by becoming a “bee walker”. As part of a national recording scheme run by the <a href=\"https://www.bumblebeeconservation.org/\" title=\"\">Bumblebee Conservation Trust</a>, I am identifying and counting bumblebees along a chosen route each month until October. My sightings will be fed into a national database to help detect early warning signs of population declines and to inform how land is managed. I am also on the lookout for other wild bees along the canal towpath and in the park. On a sunny day, I hope these outdoor spaces will be teeming not just with people liberated from lockdown, but with bees, too. My heart lifts at the thought that I can spend the summer indulging my passion for the greater good.

During the winter, I would look up into leafless trees trying to locate a bird whose loud call I could clearly hear. I even bought myself a pair of binoculars so I could acquaint myself with some of the local avian population. But now I have a new hobby. As the warmer weather slowly arrives, I have been lowering my gaze towards the stirring flower beds and roadside verges, as well as rustling in the undergrowth in the hope of spotting my favourite insects. On a sunny day, there’s nothing better than sitting quietly by a patch of swaying flowers or under a blossoming tree to listen for the tell-tale sign of buzzing. This quintessential sound of summer connects me to the seasons and the natural world, even in the inner city, and fills me with joy. It is also a welcome break from staring at a screen all day. I wait peacefully, in anticipation and excitement of seeing different types of bees. The evocatively named hairy-footed flower bee is one of the easiest to spot. She noisily darts among the clumps of lungwort (pulmonaria) that I’ve planted to attract her. Large and round with a velvety black body, she has a distinctive hovering movement and flies rather comically with her long, straw-like tongue outstretched in preparation for reaching deep inside bell-shaped flowers to extract their nectar. When she rests on a leaf, the hairs on her fluffy brown back legs are clearly visible, right down to her feet – hence her name. My curiosity in bees was awakened a few years ago when I had to give up beekeeping after developing an allergy to honeybee venom. Until then I had been fascinated with the workings of a managed bee hive, but ignorant of the myriad bee species that live in the wild. I had no idea there were so many and that they came in so many shapes, sizes and hues. I assumed all bees were black and yellow striped. But with a little patience and field guides for assistance, my eyes slowly began to open to a whole new world. It was as if I had gone on an incredible journey without leaving my garden. Even better, few of these wild bees sting, so I feel perfectly safe observing them at close quarters. And I have found that the simple pleasure of seeing something in nature and learning how to identify it is immensely gratifying. There is much research about the positive impact on our mental health of spending time in nature. The Pulitzer prize-winning biologist EO Wilson believes that humans have an innate and genetically determined affinity with the natural world, a concept he calls biophilia, which literally means a love of living things. But our modern, urban indoor lives, often cut off from the changing seasons, have stifled it. In his 2019 book Bird Therapy, Joe Harkness writes about how ornithology saved his life. He links it to five ways to improve wellbeing: connect, learn, be active, give, and take notice. From my experience, they are all equally applicable to melittology – the study of bees. Research into bees has tended to focus on their role in pollinating most of our food crops, especially those providing essential vitamins and minerals. Professor Alexandra-Maria Klein’s research at Germany’s Freiburg University also points to the wild plants and trees pollinated by bees which support our health in urban areas through air filtration and reducing the temperature among the concrete and glass. But no one seems to have examined the wellbeing attained by just stopping and taking time to notice foraging bees. When you see a bee visiting a flower you are witnessing a love affair that began more than 100m years ago, when plants evolved brightly coloured petals and fragrant scents. Their beauty and rich perfumes were solely designed to lure pollinators by advertising the sugary drink that lurked deep within their nectaries. Bees need nectar to fuel their flight (and turn into honey in the case of honeybees) and pollen to feed their larvae. In return for meeting their dietary requirements, bees act as a romantic go-between for the world’s flora, transporting enough pollen from the male part of the flower to the female to allow them to produce seeds and reproduce. No one describes this symbiotic relationship better than the poet Kahlil Gibran, who wrote: “To the bee, a flower is the fountain of life, and to the flower the bee is a messenger of love.” For me, a bee on a flower is no longer just a bee, but now has a name, both a common and a Latin one, which can often provide a clue to their favourite flowers, and how they construct their nests. Mining bees make burrows underground to lay their eggs in, leaf-cutter bees plug their nests with circular pieces of leaves – often cut from a rose bush and leaving it looking as if it has been attacked with a hole-punch. Carpenter bees fashion their nests from wood. Every year I hope to spot a few more of the 250-plus wild bee species in the UK. Many are small and brown, making them difficult to distinguish from each other; some are so tiny they are hardly visible to the naked eye, while others are restricted to rare coastal habitats. According to Friends of the Earth, at least 35 are endangered (including a quarter of our bumblebee species) due to habitat loss and widespread pesticide use. Since 1945, 97% of our wildflower meadows have been lost to intensive agriculture and urbanisation. Yet some bees are thriving in towns and cities where gardens, tree-lined avenues and parks can provide an abundant and varied diet. I have tried to create Yeats’s “bee-loud glade” in my small urban garden by planting flowers that bloom sequentially, so there is always something for dinner, from early spring to late autumn. Bowl-shaped and daisy-style flowers for the short-tongued bees and pendulous ones for the longer-tongued, like the garden bumblebee. I love watching her disappearing deep inside a foxglove only to reappear moments later cloaked in pollen grains. I may not be physically active when observing these interactions, but creating suitable bee habitat provides plenty of outdoor exercise. Under the south-facing eaves of our garden shed, my husband has installed a series of manmade bee hotels (which contain hollow tubes where bees can check-in to lay their eggs). Each year, just as our apple tree is bursting into blossom, I hear the humming of a new generation of red mason bees checking out. This synchronicity between the apple tree and its loyal pollinator reassures me that all is well with the world – at least in my tiny corner of it. As the summer progresses, I’ll be captivated by the industriousness of the wool carder bee as she teases out the fibres from the soft leaves of the lamb’s ear plant. She will roll them into a ball nearly as big as herself and fly it home to partition and plug her nest. Since I started my bee journey I have shared my enthusiasm for these wondrous creatures and my discoveries about them in books, talks and educational materials. This year, with the help of the amazing insect photographer, Penny Metal, I am posting bee-spotter guides on social media and I have launched a newsletter with tips for identifying bees and how to help them. Now that we can start to see our friends and family again, I’m not about to give up my hobby. I have put my skills to good use by becoming a “bee walker”. As part of a national recording scheme run by the Bumblebee Conservation Trust, I am identifying and counting bumblebees along a chosen route each month until October. My sightings will be fed into a national database to help detect early warning signs of population declines and to inform how land is managed. I am also on the lookout for other wild bees along the canal towpath and in the park. On a sunny day, I hope these outdoor spaces will be teeming not just with people liberated from lockdown, but with bees, too. My heart lifts at the thought that I can spend the summer indulging my passion for the greater good. What could be better for your wellbeing than that?

On Monday, the contestants had to get inventive with “basic” vegetables. On Tuesday, a blindfolded pressure test challenged the bottom four to recreate Clinton McIver’s aged lamb, which felled Eric in truly spectacular fashion. Wednesday saw them tasked with using only the utensils found in most Australian kitchens, which recalled the time I tried to cook dinner at the house of an ex who owned only one fork. Finally, it was a “world’s hottest chilli” challenge on Thursday. Despite her attempting to murder Andy with the power of 1.5m Scovilles, Linda’s “God Stopper” steak declared her the official Hot Chilli Woman of MasterChef and secured immunity for Sunday night’s elimination challenge. Sunday The gang enters a nearly-empty kitchen to cries of “Ohh, what is this?” and “There’s definitely not enough benches …” Are they going to have to draw straws and sacrifice the losers? And where is Mel?? (“Unfortunately, she can’t be here today,” offers Andy, with a foreboding lack of further information.) The dystopian mood spikes when Andy and Jock reveal a Fortress Of Solitude-esque plinth covered in game meat cuts. The contestants have to correctly identify as many of the mystery meats as possible, or it’s into round two to cook. Pescatarian Tom is sweating, though reckons some “long, white meat” is crocodile and not, say, the thigh of one of the eliminated contestants. Elise reveals her boyfriend is a hunter, and I quietly make a note never to say anything mean about Elise. “I’m a kindergarten teacher!” cries Tommy as he tries to work out which slabs of meat are the remains of fluffy animals he’s told his pupils about. The marks are in: Elise Everdeen is unsurprisingly safe, and the laser-targets slowly slip away from the judges’ foreheads as she ascends to the gantry. At the other end of the spectrum are Kishwar, Tommy, Pete, Tom and Aaron, who now have to pick a game meat to cook. Jock and Andy fire up the game puns and it’s time to get cracking. Aaron’s doing kangaroo to make up for the failures of his audition effort, a roo dish that had him Cook Again. Kishwar has chosen goat, something she’d usually marinate overnight, so I’m already sweating. “You’re on the edge of tears,” Jock offers helpfully, before Kishwar explodes into an ad break. Kishwar no!! Andy and Jock have a chat about the game meats that are safer choices (quail, wallaby, duck), and those that are more dangerous, which is essentially a screed about the perils of cooking crocodile: it can tighten up, it can go rubbery. Guess what Tom’s picked?? Tommy’s picked pheasant, despite having never cooked with it, because he wants to test himself, while I load a heart attack hotline number into my phone “just in case”. There’s too much YOLO energy in this kitchen today! Thankfully for my nerves, ASMR Pete is spatchcocking a quail, and has “done a lot of research” about what flavours to pair with it. Andy and Tom rock up to Tom’s station, where he’s made about 10 attempts to cook his crocodile. “Are you having a tough time?” Jock asks, while Tom imagines Jock being ripped apart by crocs.

He takes it off the hibachi to rest, and, well ... Jock visits Tom’s bench, where he’s now trialled so many crocodile cooking techniques that the beasts have been listed as critically endangered: “Are you happy with any of that?” “No.” “Are you worried?” “Yes.” Good chat, guys!

On the other, the Conservatives appear to be marketing themselves as the party of working people.</p> <p>It is not even as if the government has lived up to its promises. At the last election, Johnson promised an employment bill that would make UK labour rights the envy of the world. There were many pieces of legislation proposed in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/may/11/the-guardian-view-on-the-queens-speech-sins-of-omission\">Queen’s Speech</a> earlier this month: an employment bill was not one of them.</p> <p>One explanation is that a rift between Labour’s blue-collar and white-collar wings has provided the Conservatives with an opportunity to rebrand themselves as the voice of blue-collar Britain, even though in reality they remain the party of the well-heeled. Seen from this perspective workers are suffering from false consciousness, unable to see what is in their own best interests.</p> <p>This reading of politics seems to fit with the loss of support for Labour in its former so-called “red wall seats, but doesn’t really stand up to close inspection. As an interesting <a href=\"https://flipchartfairytales.wordpress.com/2021/05/21/labours-problem-is-not-the-working-class-its-the-grey-wall/amp/?mc_cid=74eab036d3&amp;mc_eid=d24b73c812\">blog post has revealed</a>, Labour’s loss of support has not been so much among working age voters as among the elderly, who own their homes outright and can live relatively comfortably on their pensions.</p> <p>Strip out pensioners and the profile of voting is pretty much what might be expected: people at the bottom end of the income scale support Labour while those at the top back the Conservatives. The tipping point comes at just above median income. So while Johnson won decisively in 2019, picking up lots of red wall seats in the process, it was older voters who swung it for him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe id=\"business-today\" name=\"business-today\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/business-today\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--business-today\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This analysis matters. Firstly, it suggests that red wall seats remain in play. The idea that the deep structural problems of old industrial Britain are going to be solved by some catchy phrases and the politics of the pork barrel is a fantasy. Secondly, it suggests that Labour has no need to panic and should focus on putting together a package of measures aimed at improving the pay and conditions of workers.</p> <p>In reality, that is precisely what the opposition is doing. Andy McDonald, the shadow secretary of state for employment rights and protection is working on a Labour’s New Deal for workers, with the involvement of other frontbenchers including Ed Miliband and Angela Rayner, and the full support of Sir Keir Starmer.</p> <p>Ideas being considered include a clampdown on bogus self-employment, bringing together enforcement agencies for the minimum wage and health and safety under a ministry of labour, and legislation to make it easier for unions to organise and bargain collectively. McDonald’s view is that the UK’s labour laws need a complete overhaul, and there are millions of low-paid, shabbily treated, vulnerable workers in red wall seats and beyond who would doubtless agree with him.</p>","wordcount":"955","firstPublicationDate":"2021-05-30T11:06:10Z","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2021-05-30T11:19:49Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/p/htabb","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/951709594df097ffeae18e583d4ae6c8fab93ad4/0_51_5785_3471/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","isLive":"true","bodyText":"Even before the Covid-19 pandemic Britain was becoming a more unequal country.

On the other, the Conservatives appear to be marketing themselves as the party of working people. It is not even as if the government has lived up to its promises. At the last election, Johnson promised an employment bill that would make UK labour rights the envy of the world. There were many pieces of legislation proposed in the Queen’s Speech earlier this month: an employment bill was not one of them. One explanation is that a rift between Labour’s blue-collar and white-collar wings has provided the Conservatives with an opportunity to rebrand themselves as the voice of blue-collar Britain, even though in reality they remain the party of the well-heeled. Seen from this perspective workers are suffering from false consciousness, unable to see what is in their own best interests. This reading of politics seems to fit with the loss of support for Labour in its former so-called “red wall seats, but doesn’t really stand up to close inspection. As an interesting blog post has revealed, Labour’s loss of support has not been so much among working age voters as among the elderly, who own their homes outright and can live relatively comfortably on their pensions. Strip out pensioners and the profile of voting is pretty much what might be expected: people at the bottom end of the income scale support Labour while those at the top back the Conservatives. The tipping point comes at just above median income. So while Johnson won decisively in 2019, picking up lots of red wall seats in the process, it was older voters who swung it for him. This analysis matters. Firstly, it suggests that red wall seats remain in play. The idea that the deep structural problems of old industrial Britain are going to be solved by some catchy phrases and the politics of the pork barrel is a fantasy. Secondly, it suggests that Labour has no need to panic and should focus on putting together a package of measures aimed at improving the pay and conditions of workers. In reality, that is precisely what the opposition is doing. Andy McDonald, the shadow secretary of state for employment rights and protection is working on a Labour’s New Deal for workers, with the involvement of other frontbenchers including Ed Miliband and Angela Rayner, and the full support of Sir Keir Starmer. Ideas being considered include a clampdown on bogus self-employment, bringing together enforcement agencies for the minimum wage and health and safety under a ministry of labour, and legislation to make it easier for unions to organise and bargain collectively. McDonald’s view is that the UK’s labour laws need a complete overhaul, and there are millions of low-paid, shabbily treated, vulnerable workers in red wall seats and beyond who would doubtless agree with him.","charCount":"5634","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/larryelliott\">Larry Elliott</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2021/may/30/frankie-review-isabelle-huppert-portugal","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-30T11:00:01Z","webTitle":"Frankie review – trouble in a Portuguese paradise with Isabelle Huppert","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/may/30/frankie-review-isabelle-huppert-portugal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2021/may/30/frankie-review-isabelle-huppert-portugal","fields":{"headline":"Frankie review – trouble in a Portuguese paradise with Isabelle Huppert","standfirst":"<p>A spectacular setting and compelling performances lift Ira Sachs’s humourless drama about the woes of the wealthy</p>","trailText":"A spectacular setting and compelling performances lift Ira Sachs’s humourless drama about the woes of the wealthy","byline":"Simran Hans","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d1b537ea342ffc6e228f553c21af8cb82e98fe71\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1b537ea342ffc6e228f553c21af8cb82e98fe71/78_484_8123_4874/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Isabelle Huppert with Jérémie Renier in Frankie\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Queenly presence’: Isabelle Huppert with Jérémie Renier in Frankie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: 2019 Photo Guy Ferrandis / SBS Productions</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>The famously stylish Isabelle Huppert spends a stretch of this handsome drama on her hands and knees.

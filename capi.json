They are not often popular. And they would likely be even less popular in a period of rising inflation or falling terms of trade or slow real growth or rising interest rates, but those are the very circumstances in which our currently favourable debt dynamics would reverse.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>The second microeconomic argument against debt and deficit is that the government spending would crowd out private investment.</p> <p>Brennan also argued that despite Covid-19’s interruption to global supply chains, self-sufficiency was unlikely to work in the Australian context, after an unhappy 80 years protecting domestic manufacturing at great expense.<br><br>Brennan suggested firms should aim for bigger inventories and Australia should diversify trading relationships rather than aim to make everything itself.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-06-08T04:50:47.894Z\">at 5.50am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-60bef20b8f0837b8708e0be8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-08T04:29:16.701Z\">5.29am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This is happening next week in NZ.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/benmackey/status/1402120245658013696\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">PM Jacinda Ardern will also be getting her first vaccination next week 💉 <a href=\"https://t.co/eJsLKH1lv9\">https://t.co/eJsLKH1lv9</a></p>&mdash; Ben McKay (@benmackey) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/benmackey/status/1402120245658013696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 8, 2021</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60bef0148f0837b8708e0bd9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-08T04:23:47.995Z\">5.23am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>My colleague <strong>Josh Taylor</strong> has the latest on the youngest daughter of the Tamil family from Biloela.

I’m afraid it won’t be a memorial for very much longer.</p> <p>It might be a place of entertainment but in my view it will not be the place of remembrance that I grew up with.</p> </blockquote>

around the world.</p> <p>To try and turn it into a theme park or a place of entertainment, whatever words we want to use, is not right.</p> </blockquote> <p>Barrie said he is most concerned that in the pursuit of a “bigger and better” attraction, future generations of Australians will lose the opportunity to quietly reflect on the country’s military history.</p> <p>The National Capital Authority has given the nod for early works at the memorial, including the demolition of Anzac Hall.<br></p> <p>At least 140 trees will be removed as part of the redevelopment, which will eventually be replaced by 250 native trees.<br></p> <p>The NCA, which has published a 1200-page consultation report, received 601 submissions during its consultation process, of which just three were in support.<br></p> <p>Key concerns were the need for the expansion, tree removal, the impacts on heritage values and the cost.<br></p> <p>The memorial argues the project will address constraints to the existing use of the building, improve the overall visitor and veterans’ experience and maintain its significance as a national cultural institution.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time

The escalation over the past six months across Australia is largely related to suicide attempts (38%) and child abuse (35%). Kids Helpline is a service run by youth charity yourtown. Yourtown CEO Tracy Adams said the organisation had feared an increase in child vulnerability as a result of the pandemic and ensuing lockdowns. “However the current spike in emergency interventions on behalf of children and young people in New South Wales and Victoria is very disturbing,” Adams said. New South Wales has had an increase of 40% in duty of care interventions enacted by Kids Helpline on behalf of children and young people for the period 1 December 2020 – 31 May 2021 vs the same period a year ago. For those children and young people aged between 5 – 25 years of age, 44% of emergency interventions over the past six months in New South Wales have been in response to child abuse and 35% have been in response to an immediate intent to enact suicide. Victoria has had an increase of 184% in duty of care interventions enacted by Kids Helpline on behalf of children and young people for the period 1 December 2020 – 31 May 2021 vs the same period a year ago. Kids Helpline’s Victorian data over the last six months reveals that 75% of emergency interventions were for young people aged 13 – 18 years of age. For those children and young people aged between 5 – 25 years of age, 44% of emergency interventions over the past six months in Victoria have been in response to an immediate intent to enact suicide with child abuse accounting for 31%. It is very clear that the pandemic is taking a toll on the lives of children and young people, however, thankfully by young people seeking help Kids Helpline has supported 862 suicide prevention interventions nationally in the past six months. Children and young people who want to talk to someone about any issue of concern to them can contact Kids Helpline on 1800 551 800, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week or use email or web counselling services at www.kidshelpline.com.au The Aged and Community Services Association says other states and territories should follow Western Australia’s decision to make the Covid-19 vaccine mandatory for aged care workers. The association’s chairperson, Sara Blunt, said: Vaccinating aged care residents and the workforce is an essential protection for older Australians, particularly as Covid circulation and outbreaks continue in the community. Victoria, NSW, South Australian and Queensland have made positive moves towards giving aged care workers priority access at their vaccination hubs, but we must step up the effort. We support the introduction of mandatory Covid vaccines for both residential and home care workers, with appropriate exemptions on medical and other significant grounds. This must be done in a way that increases vaccination rates without adversely impacting on workforce numbers, at a time when the sector needs more workers to support the extra demands of Covid and the implementation of the royal commission reforms. Governments showed during the pandemic how quickly and co-operatively they could work during a crisis. Let’s see the same ingenuity and urgency applied by Australian governments to safeguard tens of thousands of lives with greater vaccination of aged care residents and workers. Business conditions struck a fresh record high in May, pointing to an extension of the rapid economic recovery from last year’s recession and a drop in the jobless rate in coming months, reports AAP. However, the Victorian Covid-19 lockdown continues to sap consumer confidence, particularly, and unsurprisingly, among Melburnians. National Australia Bank’s monthly survey posted a second consecutive record peak for business conditions in May, rising five points to 37 points. Index components for trade, employment and profitability also hit new highs. NAB chief economist Alan Oster said overall the survey was another very strong result for the business sector and forward indicators pointed to ongoing strength in the near term. The economy now appears to be entering a new period of growth after a very rapid rebound. McGowan says Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people aged 16 and over will also now be eligible to be vaccinated. He says: State-run clinics like Claremont Showgrounds, Joondalup, Kwinana and Redcliffe will be scaled up from next week to administer the Pfizer vaccine to the eligible younger demographic. Claremont will begin with appointments from the 30- to 49-year cohort from this Thursday. Western Australian premier Mark McGowan has just announced the government will open up the Covid-19 vaccine rollout to people 30 years old and older. He says: Western Australians between 30 and 49 will be able to get the Covid-19 vaccination with bookings opening today. We are fast-tracking the rollout of the Covid-19 vaccination program offering the vaccine to all eligible Western Australians over the age of 30. This means those aged between 30 and 49 will receive the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine at state-run clinics, starting this Thursday 10 June. And people aged over 50 will continue to receive the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine. The Productivity Commission chair, Michael Brennan, has warned that Australia shouldn’t continue debt-and-deficit fiscal policy even if low interest rates allow the country to (for a time). In a speech to the Committee for the Economic Development of Australia, Brennan rejected the view that “debt and deficit no longer matter at all” – a rebuttal of modern monetary theory. Brennan said: In the economists’ language, the view that growth rates will outpace interest rates provides some comfort about the sustainability of existing, steady state debt levels, but it gives no guidance as to which steady state debt level we should choose. In choosing a debt level, there is both a macroeconomic and a microeconomic case for caution. The macro case is, first, that we need to rebuild fiscal buffers for the next emergency. Second, that if inflation did re-emerge, or if bond yields exceeded nominal growth for a period – not impossible for a resource exporter like Australia – then, by implication, we would need a fiscal consolidation. Successful fiscal consolidations in history are rare. They are not often popular. And they would likely be even less popular in a period of rising inflation or falling terms of trade or slow real growth or rising interest rates, but those are the very circumstances in which our currently favourable debt dynamics would reverse. The second microeconomic argument against debt and deficit is that the government spending would crowd out private investment. Brennan also argued that despite Covid-19’s interruption to global supply chains, self-sufficiency was unlikely to work in the Australian context, after an unhappy 80 years protecting domestic manufacturing at great expense. Brennan suggested firms should aim for bigger inventories and Australia should diversify trading relationships rather than aim to make everything itself. This is happening next week in NZ. My colleague Josh Taylor has the latest on the youngest daughter of the Tamil family from Biloela. She has been airlifted to hospital in Perth. You can read Josh’s wrap of home affairs minister Karen Andrews’ comments below. It includes this paragraph: According to evidence provided to Senate estimates from the department in May, the cost to detain the family on Christmas Island between August 2019 and the end of January 2021 has been $6.7m, including $2.3m in detention, food, cleaning and school costs, $1.2m for travel costs, $100,000 for medical costs, $1m for legal and translation costs and $2.1m in staffing costs. South Australia has expanded its Covid-19 vaccine rollout to all people aged 40 to 49 ahead of the allocation of $86m in this month’s budget to further expand the program, reports AAP. The state has also extended access to the Pfizer vaccine to all disability workers, while SA Health has granted an exemption for the Geelong AFL team to enter the state for the game against Port Adelaide on Thursday night. The chief public health officer, Prof Nicola Spurrier, said the travelling group would be limited to 50 people and testing requirements would be rigorous, with players required to return a negative result before being allowed to travel into South Australia. The Geelong team has also been placed in quarantine from Monday night and will need to sign a declaration that they have not visited any sites of concern in Victoria. They will fly in on a charter plane and leave immediately after the game, as Collingwood did for their match against the Adelaide Crows last weekend. Spurrier said: We’ve got SA Pathology on board to do the rapid turnaround of tests. The premier, Steven Marshall, said giving every South Australian access to the vaccine was a key priority and the budget allocation would allow efforts to be maximised. He said: This $86 million investment will mean SA Health will have the resources they need to be able to pivot where required to get this vital vaccine into the arms of South Australians. South Australia’s health and economic response to the pandemic has led the world, and we will continue to scale up the state’s vaccine rollout in a way that maximises our vaccine supplies, protects South Australians and aligns with the latest health advice. This is quite a statistic. Just to let you know, we are expecting a vaccine update from the Western Australian premier, Mark McGowan, shortly. Thousands of people have already applied for the federal government’s Covid-19 disaster payment after claims opened today. The government said in a statement that “thousands of claims have been successfully lodged and Services Australia has already started granting claims”. Linda Reynolds, the government services minister, said: Services Australia staff are now processing Covid-19 disaster payment claims and prioritising payments and services to support Victorians through this current lockdown period. Once a claim has been lodged, using a Centrelink online account through myGov, customers do not need to do anything else. When their claim is approved, customers should get their payment the next business day. Customers will receive an SMS when their claim is submitted. People don’t need to call to check on their claim. We expect significant interest in this payment and ask that people be patient, especially during the first few days as Services Australia processes these claims for support. Payments will also be backdated to the date someone first became eligible, rather than the date the claim was lodged. You can make a claim through your MyGov account. Those who can’t claim online can call 80 22 66 for support. Phone lines are open 8am to 5pm, Monday to Friday. Eligible visa holders will need to call Services Australia on 180 22 66 to claim. For more information on the Covid-19 disaster payment go to servicesaustralia.gov.au/covid19. Matilda mentioned some terrible news out of Queensland earlier. Here are some more details. A woman has been mauled to death by three dogs she was minding in the Queensland city of Maryborough, reports AAP. The woman, aged in her 30s or 40s, suffered horrific injuries when the animals turned on her at a Milton Road property about 9am on Tuesday. The three mixed-breed dogs have been seized by the local council and are expected to be destroyed. Acting inspector Wade Lee says the woman suffered head chest and arm injuries. Police believe the dogs belong to someone else and the woman had been taking care of them. Paramedics were called but she died at the scene. Lee told reporters: The dogs were in an enclosed yard. At this stage it is just a very tragic accident. Police have not named the woman. AAP also has more on the new NSW Labor deputy leader. Londonderry MP Prue Car has been appointed deputy leader of NSW Labor, putting an end to weeks of party instability. The former shadow education minister was elected unanimously on Tuesday, when the party also selected Penny Sharpe and John Graham as joint upper house leaders. In a statement, Car said she was excited to work with newly minted leader Chris Minns. Carr said: Like Chris, I understand the pressures on family budgets and the impact of the outrageous cost of [road] tolls. Like Chris, I want to see our schools properly funded and staffed. It will be an honour to serve as deputy leader of my party and to help take a positive vision for NSW to the 2023 election. With all leadership positions filled, the party is hoping to put a damaging few weeks behind them. NSW Labor was thrown into turmoil when Jodi McKay resigned as leader on 28 May, alleging destabilisation within the party. Let’s take a quick look at the markets, via AAP. Shares have climbed to a record high on the Australian market, with property and information technology stocks faring best. The ASX200 had peaked at 7315.6 points by 1200 AEST, although gains were relatively tame across the market. Property shares led the way and were higher by 0.82%. Information technology stocks were next best and higher by 0.69%. Shares in materials, financials and energy were little changed. The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index was higher by 8.9 points, or 0.12%, to 7290.8 at 1200 AEST. The All Ordinaries was up by 11.8 points, or 0.15%, to 7543.4. There were slight falls on US markets amid a lack of market-moving news. Thanks Matilda. Luke Henriques-Gomes here. I’ll be with you for the next short while. You can contact me on Twitter @lukehgomes with tips and suggestions, or via email at luke.henriques-gomes@theguardian.com On that note, applications for the federal government’s Covid-19 disaster payment opened today. Claims can be made via Services Australia, so if you’re in Victoria and trying to apply, do let me know how you’re getting on with the process. With that, I shall leave you, but the fantastic Luke Henriques-Gomes is stepping in to take you through the afternoon. Liberal senator Andrew Bragg says he believes Australians will support a legislated voice to parliament and an amendment to the constitution that obliges the commonwealth to ensure that Indigenous peoples are heard. Bragg – the backbencher who is leading efforts to persuade colleagues to adopt the Uluru statement – will use a speech to the Sydney Institute on Tuesday night to try and map a pathway through the Coalition’s internal differences. Bragg’s efforts have also been backed by the New South Wales premier, Gladys Berejiklian, who used remarks at a book launch earlier this week to argue the Uluru statement contains “deeply liberal ideals”. In endorsing Bragg’s campaign, Berejiklian also noted “a growing mood for change on the issue of reconciliation”. You can read the full report below: An 18-year-old man from NSW is fighting for his life in a coma after he was crushed by a whale in a freak accident on the state’s south coast, reports Tiffanie Turnbull from AAP. Friends Nick and Matt were fishing in waters off Narooma on Sunday when the whale surfaced and landed on their boat. Both men were injured, but 18-year-old Nick was rushed to hospital in Canberra with a broken neck and severe head injuries. He remains in a coma. Family friend Carmen Bartley said the pair had no warning and no idea the whale was nearby. A GoFundMe appeal for donations was started to help cover Nick’s medical expenses. Here Bartley wrote: At this stage, we don’t know when he will wake up, or how this has affected his brain. Police on Tuesday issued an appeal for boaties to be alert, with whale migration season bringing scores of the animals to NSW waters. If, like me, you are struggling to keep up with where all the exposure sites are, Guardian Australia have you covered. (Not even speaking as an employee but just a Melburnian, can I just say the explainers below have been a lifesaver!) Here are all the Victorian sites: And don’t worry, we have NSW covered for you as well: Wild winds are easing after battering Victoria overnight, prompting more than 100 calls for help, as a large air mass from the Antarctic brings damaging weather across several states. A severe weather warning for parts of the Victoria’s north-east and Gippsland regions was cancelled early on Tuesday morning following strong overnight winds. Alpine areas including Mount Buller and Mount William recorded wind gusts over 100km/h to 8am on Tuesday. Closer to Melbourne, Kilmore (91km/h) and Fawkner (72km/h) north of the city were also hit by the strong gusts. You can read the full report below: After the ousting of NSW Labor leader Jodi McKay, MP Chris Minns was elected by the party to the top job. This morning he officially announced his deputy leader has now been appointed, the member for Londonderry and the current shadow minister for education Prue Car. The Department of Home Affairs has issued a statement denying allegations of inaction or mistreatment of the youngest daughter of the Tamil family from Biloela on Christmas Island. Tharnicaa Murugappan was evacuated from Christmas Island with her mother, Priya, on Monday evening to get medical treatment after Tharnicaa had been unwell for 10 days, with a fever, vomiting, diarrhoea and dizziness. Family friend Angela Fredericks told ABC News Breakfast Tharnicaa was being treated for a blood infection, sepsis, potentially caused by untreated pneumonia, questioning why it had taken so long for the three-year-old to get treatment from health officials on Christmas Island. The Department of Home Affairs issued a statement on Tuesday strongly denying any delay in medical care: The minor has been receiving medical treatment and daily monitoring on Christmas Island consistent with medical advice. This has included an IHMS general practitioner and the Christmas Island Hospital. As soon as the ABF was advised by the treating medical practitioners that the minor required medical treatment in Western Australia, the minor was transferred to a hospital in Western Australia. The Australian Border Force strongly denies any allegations of inaction or mistreatment of individuals in its care. OK, there will be a police press conference about the woman who was killed by dogs in Queensland at 11.45 am where we should get some more updates. But for now, Queensland police have confirmed they were called to a Milton Road address in Maryborough just after 9am. They had received reports that several dogs, they believe three, were attacking a person. Victorian testing commander Jeroen Weimar says a vaccination hub has been made a tier-three exposure site, with those who were there asked to monitor for symptoms. We had two cases that tested positive yesterday. Both existed in primary close contacts. We identified, as a result of that, a number of additional exposure sites. To correct the earlier statement, one positive case had a brief visit to the vaccination centre at Jeff’s Shed yesterday afternoon. That is now a tier 3 exposure site. They completed their test and they went off and got – tried to get a vaccination. They were advised to go back to isolation. We have two primary close contacts at the exhibition site now who dealt with the individual. It is a tier 3 PPE environment. It is well controlled. We’re confident there is no wider risk to the public but out of caution, we have listed it as a tier 3 site. 7 News is reporting that a woman has died after being mauled by a pack of dogs in Queensland. I’ll bring you more updates as soon as I can. Acting premier James Merlino has come out swinging against the Victorian Liberals after they spent the morning demanding Daniel Andrews release details of his back injury in March, fuelling the flames of a number of conspiracy theories currently circulating. We are dealing with a global pandemic, for goodness sake. I treat it with the contempt that it deserves. This is more about how the Liberal party treat people. No decency, no respect, they should be ashamed of themselves. I am honestly not going to spend much time on this. I think it is a disgraceful act by the Liberal party ... They should be ashamed of themselves, quite frankly. You can’t put to bed conspiracy nutters and if the Liberal party want to act disgracefully, that is a matter for them. Merlino has said again that developments today haven’t changed the timeline when it comes to the lockdown. I can’t foreshadow anything today, other than to reassure all Victorians that today doesn’t change our plans. We remain on track to provide further easing of restrictions in regional Victoria and careful easing of restrictions in Melbourne. We remain absolutely on track to deliver that. That is by virtue of the excellent work of our contact tracers. Merlino noted that the government was is considering easing the travel restrictions between Melbourne and regional Victoria on Friday. It remains the public health advice that for a period of time, we will have different settings between regional Victoria and metropolitan Melbourne. That will extend beyond any announcements that we will make later in the week. We wanted to be upfront and honest with people at the earliest opportunity, particularly because we’re coming up to the long weekend, so we are on track for an easing of restrictions, as planned this week, but there will be different settings for a period of time between regional Victoria and Melbourne. No local Covid-19 cases in NSW in case you were wondering! The home affairs minister, Karen Andrews, has said the government is looking at a “range of resettlement options” when asked about the fate of Tamil family from Biloela. The three-year-old, Australian-born youngest daughter of the family, Tharnicaa, was airlifted out of Christmas Island on Monday evening after 10 days of symptoms including a fever and taken to Perth Children’s hospital, where advocates say she has been provided antibiotics and could potentially have sepsis. In her role, Andrews has the power to intervene at any moment and allow the family to remain in Australia, but she said on Monday she could not comment on their future because negotiations on resettlement for a number of asylum seekers in Australia is currently under way: We are going through the process now of investigating a range of resettlement options in relation to a number of different circumstances here in Australia. I can’t make public commentary on that at the moment because I don’t want to disrupt those negotiations. It is the first time resettlement has been floated as an option by the government, previously Andrews had indicated the family could be put into the community on Christmas Island while their legal process is still ongoing. The family has been held in detention on Christmas Island since late 2019, after an emergency court injunction prevented their removal from Australia to Sri Lanka while a court case was underway. Gosh, we got so caught up on the Delta link I forgot to mention where those two local cases of Covid-19 today came from. Here is acting premier James Merlino from before with that information. One is a child linked to the west Melbourne outbreak, one is a household contact of a worker linked to the Arcare Maidstone outbreak. Both have limited community exposure and Jerome can speak to that later in terms of answers any questions. A number of exposure sites were put onto the website last night and we encourage all Victorians to continue to check that website and follow that health advice. While we never want to see new cases, it is reassuring that we are again seeing these cases with clear links to existing outbreaks. Prof Cheng said the returned traveller lives in the Glen Ira local government area, but confirmed that as he only returned there after being clear of his Covid-19 diagnosis and left hotel quarantine it’s unlikely he has spread the virus to the area. Again, just as anyone in Victoria, if you are unwell, please get tested. We are not particularly concerned about his movements after he was discharged from hotel quarantine because we don’t think he was infectious but for the abundance of caution we are obviously following up his contacts as well. Cheng says there may be a missing link between the returned traveller and the family infected with the Delta variants of Covid-19. Reporter: You are working on the fact there is probably a missing link between the west Melbourne family and this man? Cheng: At this stage that’s the hypothesis we are working on but obviously if there was any direct interaction we would want to know that. We don’t know that at this stage. Reporter: Just one missing link with those dates do you think it would just be the one? Cheng: We can’t really tell. I think in terms of timing, yes, that probably is about right but we didn’t – the first person in the North Melbourne cluster became symptomatic probably around the 25th. One of those cases was thought to be historical by that time so there is still a little bit of uncertainty about which exactly was the first case and therefore that determines how many people might be in between. Last week the Australian reported that a hotel quarantine facility has stored dirty linen from positive cases inside bins in an underground car park that local residents also has access to. This was at the Ibis in Melbourne. This most recent hotel quarantine breach case spent time in an Ibis hotel but Prof Cheng could not confirm which location. Reporter: Have you guys been examining whether or not that situation may have contributed to this leak?... Correction Victoria commissioner Emma Cassar: We have investigated those allegations and can confirm that there is no sharing of entries with the residents. The residents actually enter on the opposite side of the building and myself and two of our deputy state controllers of health inspected that and we are satisfied with the controls in place. If you are wondering when this hotel quarantine case might have infected someone in the community, deputy chief health officer Prof Allen Cheng has you covered: The first possibility is that the case transmitted to or was infected by another passenger on the plane and that that person has gone on to infect someone in the community. The second possibility is that the case transmitted after he left hotel quarantine. The third is that the case transmitted to a staff member somewhere along their journey from the airport to transport to the first hotel to transport to the second hotel and then out to the community. And then the fourth possibility is that the case transmitted to a hotel resident who has then transmitted to the community after their quarantine stay. We have addressed all of these and some of these are still ongoing investigations. The government services minister, Danny Pearson, says health authorities are still trying to work out how the returned traveller accidentally spread Covid-19 into the community. The traveller arrived from Sri Lanka on 8 May and tested positive that same day. He was transferred from the Novatel Ibis quarantine hotel to the Holiday Inn health hotel on 14 May. He completed his quarantine and was released on 23 May. Pearson investigations remain ongoing but he can so far confirm the following: There were 24 people on the traveller’s plane including crew, all passengers tested negative. All Skybus crew from that shift tested negative. 268 CQV staff worked at the hotel IBIS on 8 and 9 May and 360 staff at the health hotel. No positive tests have been identified to date and staff surveillance testing is being examined. All 12 residents housed on the same floor in the Novatel Ibis health hotel have tested negative. None of the residents in the health hotel during this period had the virus. All CQV staff at the hotel Ibis and Holiday Inn were vaccinated by 3 May. And Merlino hasn’t missed a beat using the news of yet another hotel quarantine break to attack the federal government’s reliance on the system. Hotels are built for tourists, not for managing infectious diseases. There have been at least 21 breaches in hotel quarantine right around this country. Just in the last month, we have seen three outbreaks, one in South Australia and two in WA. Despite all the protections that we put in place, appropriately put in place, vaccination of staff, daily testing of staff, PPE, N95 masks, ventilation works just to name a few, we cannot eliminate risk in this environment. The fact that Howard Springs is the only system in the country that has seen no breaches really speaks for itself. That’s why we pushed so hard to get a purpose-built quarantine facility. Howard Springs is the only facility in this country that has not seen a breach and that’s exactly why we have been pushing for this purpose-built facility. The best-case scenario was that this was done a year ago. The next best scenario is that we get it done immediately. I am very pleased, as we have heard over the last few days, that that’s received the support of the federal government. We will get this facility built – this purpose-built facility – built as quickly as possible and in the mean time we will do our absolute best within our hotel quarantine system to reduce risk as much as is humanely possible. While Merlino was certainly making no promises, he sounded cautiously optimistic about Melbourne’s ability to at least partially come out of lockdown at the end of the week, and for further restrictions to be eased in regional Victoria. Thanks to their outstanding work we remain on track to later in this week announce, as we have said we have planned to do all along, further easing of restriction in regional Victoria and careful easing of restrictions in Melbourne. This cluster was discovered after the lockdown was in place and nothing about today changes our plan. So I just want to send that very reassuring message to all Victorians. Nothing about today changes our plans. Thanks to the outstanding work of our contact tracing team, we remain on track to deliver a further easing of restrictions in regional Victoria and easing of restrictions in Melbourne. Huzzah! Victorian officials have finally linked the mystery Delta variant outbreak to a returned traveller from hotel quarantine (and not from NSW). As we advised last week with assistance from the Doherty Institute, we have been checking all known positive cases against the genomic sequencing for the cases in this cluster. I can confirm today that we have now found a match between a returned traveller who entered hotel quarantine in Melbourne on 8 May and this cluster. While we have a genomic link, we do not currently have an ep deem logical link, further investigations are underway to see if we are able to establish any contact between the returned traveller and these families. There’s currently no definitive understanding of where a transmission events may have occurred but we are investigating all possibilities from the plane to travel to hotel. Speaking of Victoria, acting premier James Merlino is speaking now to give a Covid-19 update. Oh my gosh. The “Daniel Andrews falling conspiracy theory” drama in Victoria keeps getting funnier today! With permission from the premier, Ambulance Victoria has released the details of their call out for his injury. The home affairs minister, Karen Andrews, says the department is considering “a range of resettlement options” for the Biloela family. This is a considerably softer approach than other government figures have indicated today. We are going through the process now of investigating a range of resettlement options in relation to a number of different circumstances here in Australia. I can’t make public commentary on that at the moment because I don’t want to disrupt those negotiations. Andrews was then asked why she won’t make a captains call on the Biloela family and allow them to return to their home in regional Queensland. As the prime minister already said, there is already a matter before the court in relation to the issue with the young child. That child is now receiving appropriate medical care in Perth. (Worth remember that those court cases absolutely do not stop Andrews from using ministerial discretion to bring them home straight away.) Questions have turned now to the Biloela family, with Morrison being asked when a decision on their case will be made. As you know, this is a matter going through the court’s process that they’ve initiated and there are some present medical issues involving the family. And they will continue to receive every medical care and that care and where they are treated will continue to be determined by doctors, by the medical professionals who advise us on these matters. Kershaw is laying out why the APF need the extended telecommunication security bill passed in order to tackle crime on the dark web. We’re really encouraging the parliament to pass that bill in particular and the IPO bill. Because we need to be ahead. We need to be a step ahead and encrypted comms and going dark on the dark web. As you know, there’s multiple crimes. If you go on there right now, you can purchase whatever you want. There’s proliferation of child sexual abuse material on the dark web. It’s an absolute disgrace. So for us, that’s a criminal marketplace that we can’t actually penetrate without that legislation. According to AFP commissioner Reece Kershaw, underworld kingpins are turning on each other after the arrests. Well, they all turn on each other. The other thing that we learnt is that they actually do a lot of business behind each other’s backs, including the presidents of various groups and organisations for personal wealth. So there’s going to be a whole lot of disruption there, and our state police colleagues are on alert for that. Because there’s no doubt going to be some tension within the whole system about who owes what drug debt and so on. So that was pretty brazen to see that they were actually disloyal to their own groups. OK, so we have got through all the cool things the AFP has down. Scott Morrison is now coming in full force with his pitch for getting his increased police powers bill. There are three things that we need to do. One of them does relate to air and the transport security laws that are in this country. The first one is that there’s is surveillance legislation amendment which is about identifying and disrupting, and the AFP and the ACIC powers to combat serious crime on the dark web, and in circumstances where anonomising technologies with detection of serious crime. We have law in the parliament at the moment which does not have bipartisan support, which we need support for, to give them powers to do that. The telecommunications legislation amendment – international production orders bill ... That does not have bipartisan support and we need it passed. And the third one is the Transport Security Amendment of Serious Crime bill. That is the bill that is needed to stop organised criminals getting access to our walls and to our airports. We have sought to have this bill passed through three successive parliaments. And it still continues to be opposed by Labor. Now, this is critical to ensure that criminals don’t get on to our walls. That they can’t access security credentials and things of that nature. I don’t know why they’re being protective. I can’t give you an answer to that. We want to shut it down. Kershaw says the infiltration into this encrypted app allowed authorities to prevent a mass shooting, although he did not go into details as to where this would have taken place. He said this was not intended as a terrorist act. It’s organised crime. So that particular case will come out later on where they were using a machine gun and potentially at a cafe where people would have been no doubt harmed. We were able to, with the cooperation of that particular state police force, take out that individual before they were able to do that. Kershaw said he could not give more details as arrests into that incident were still being carried out. OK, now we are getting some of the details of this fake FBI app. Reporter: Do you think that the people you were targeting had any idea that you were listening and watching? AFP Commissioner Reece Kershaw: No. Let me be clear. When you get access and it will come out in court, you’ll see that all they talk about is drugs, violence, hits on each other, innocent people who are going to be murdered. A whole range of things ... It would be like, “I need 1,000 kilos at this price”. Very brazen. No attempt to hide behind any kind of codified kind of conversation. Including we’ll have a speed boat to meet you at this. And this is who will be doing that? Heads up, we are expecting to hear from the Victorian government and health authorities at 10.30am. OK so that’s the achievements, here comes the “war on drugs” rhetoric from prime minister Scott Morrison. People sitting at home might be thinking – what can we do to help the AFP? In this battle against organised crime in this country. I want to make a few comments about illicit drug use in this country. There’s nothing social about illicit drug use in this country. It fuels organised crime in this country. It fuels human misery in this country and in many parts of the world. There’s nothing social about it. It’s dangerous. And all of us have a responsibility, all of us have a responsibility in our own relationships and our own families, in our own communities, to be doing what we can to encourage positive behaviours, positive behaviours that don’t indulge illicit drug use. Illicit drug use ruins lives and it fuels organised crime. Cue the appeal to the children: The AFP will do their job and we’ll make sure that they’re resourced to do their job. We also have a job to do. Let’s keep Australia safe. Let’s ensure that illicit drug use in this country doesn’t take our children. Kershaw: This was brought out of the close long-standing relationship between the AFP and the FBI. Our relationships and international networks were mobilised and it is these partnerships which have made this operation a success. Partnering with the AFP, the AFP had access to a new encrypted application named ANOM. And began running it without the knowledge of the criminal underworld. And the AFP provided the highly skilled technical staff and capability to decrypt and read these encrypted communications sent over ANOM in real time. Giving law enforcement an edge that it had never had before. Essentially, we have been in the back pockets of organised crime and operationalised the criminal takedown like we have never seen. The Australian federal police commissioner, Reece Kershaw, says 224 people have been charged so far. As the minister stated, more than 4,000 officers from law enforcement in Australia have been involved in executing over 525 search warrants in every mainland state in Australia. We have arrested the alleged kingmakers behind these crimes. Prevented mass shootings in suburbs and frustrated serious and organised crime by seizing their ill-gotten wealth. As of today, we have charged 224 alleged offenders, including 525 charges laid. Shut down six clandestine laboratories and acted on 21 threats to kill, including saving a family of five. And seized 104 firearms and weapons and almost $45m in cash. And these figures are likely to increase over the coming days. Collectively, these alleged offenders are facing jail terms that could run into hundreds of years and some of the charges they are facing carry life imprisonment. It looks like the prime minister is using news the massive drug to try and gain support for giving the Australian federal police, and law enforcement in general, greater powers. (A line of rhetoric that always make me really nervous.) But what’s important as we go forward from this point is not just the support that we continue to provide that we see in the budget, but we need to continue to provide our law enforcement authorities with the powers and the authorities that they need to do this job. I’ll going into this later in questions, but there is a series of legislation, not just in this term, but in some cases over three terms. They need these powers to do their job. The AFP and our law enforcement agencies who support them need the support of our parliament to continue to do the job that they do to continue to keep Australians safe. Our government won’t shirk from that and we call on all of those in the parliament to do that as we have done for such a long time and to get the results that in particular we’ve seen today. Morrison: Operation Ironside has now charged hundreds of alleged offenders. Seized millions of dollars in criminal processes. Removed weapons from our streets and saved lives. And we’ll continue to. It is an ongoing operation. The operation puts Australia at the forefront of the fight against criminals who peddle in misery and ultimately, it will keep our communities and Australians safe. More than 4,000 police officers across Australia have been involved in this operation. There’s not a day that goes past when I am not thankful for the work of all of our police. All of our police all around the country. They step up for our protection. They take upon themselves great risks. They see things. They’re involved in these things that the rest of the citizens don’t have to see. And for that, we owe every single police officer our great thanks and afford them our great respect. So let’s talk about this drug bust news. The Australian federal police hasn’t put out a full statement yet but media reports today suggest more than 100 members of Australia’s underworld including the “mafia” and bikie group have been arrested in a huge international crime sting. For years the AFP worked with the FBI to trick underworld figures into communicating via an encrypted app known as AN0M. Unfortunately for the underworld figures, the police created the app. Authorities say they were able to read up to 25 million messages and uncovered 21 murder plots, seized more than 3,000kg of drugs and found $35m in cash. The prime minister is speaking about the operation now: Today, the Australian government, as part of a global operation, has struck a heavy blow against organised crime – not just in this country, but one that will echo around organised crime around the world. This is a watershed moment in Australian law enforcement history. This has not been independently confirmed by Guardian Australia as of yet but advocates for the Bioela family say three-year-old Tharnicaa has been diagnosed with pneumonia after been medically evacuated from detention in Christmas Island to Perth. It’s been a bit of a heavy morning so far, so here is some dinosaur news from the Guardian’s amazing new science reporter Donna Lu: A new species of dinosaur discovered in south-west Queensland has been officially recognised as the largest ever found in Australia and among the biggest in the world. The Australotitan cooperensis, a plant-eating dinosaur of the family known as titanosaurs, likely lived between 92m and 96m years ago, during the Cretaceous period. It was between 25m and 30m long, stood between 5m and 6.5m from the ground to its hip and had a very long neck and tail, making it similar in appearance to well-known dinosaurs such as Brachiosaurus and Apatosaurus. You can read the full story below: Less than 3% of Australians over 16 have been fully vaccinated against coronavirus but health chiefs are tipping numbers will soar in coming weeks. The sluggish national rollout of jabs continues to spark concern with Melbourne in the grips of another lockdown-inducing outbreak, reports Matt Coughlan from AAP. While the immunisation program is ramping up, just 613,000 people, or about 2.9% of the nation’s adults, have received both doses. Chief nursing officer Prof Alison McMillan told Sky News on Tuesday she is confident that figure will grow significantly with many people nearing the 12-week gap between AstraZeneca shots. Case numbers have remained relatively low in Victoria but an emergence of the Delta and Kappa strains prevalent in India are causing authorities concern. McMillan declared vaccination would be the only way to counter emerging variants. There are multiple strains and we will continue to see Covid adapt and mutate – that’s what these viruses do. We’re likely to see other strains emerging. The sooner we can get the world vaccinated, the less likely it is that it can mutate. It mutates and finds it easier to do when there’s a significant population infected at any one time. More than 5 million doses have been administered nationwide including more than 1 million over the past 10 days. We are just waiting on a press conference from the AFP and prime minister on massive international drug bust operations and arrests across Australia and New Zealand. We heard from the NZ police just before: [There were] 37 search warrants resulting in the arrest of 35 people who are appearing before the court today on serious drug dealing, money laundering and other conspiracy-type charges. To date we’ve seized during the course of these operations about 8.6kg of meth that came in through the border. Yesterday, we recovered about 20kg of methamphetamine, over $1 million in cash, four firearms, multiple kilos of iodine and we restrained about $3.7 million of assets to date. Warrants are coming in and we expect a number of other arrests to be undertaken. The prime minister is expected to speak to the media about this around 9.30 am. Support for the Coalition’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic has fallen to its lowest level since the outbreak began, as almost half of all voters view the federal government less favourably than they did a year ago. But the findings, contained in the latest Guardian Essential poll, also show that voters in locked-down Victoria are spreading the blame for the latest outbreak, with both the Coalition and the Andrews government losing ground over the past month among voters in the state. Overall, one in four voters now believe the Morrison government is doing a “very poor” or “quite poor” job of managing the pandemic, the highest level since March last year, and six percentage points higher than when the same question was asked a fortnight ago. You can read the full story below: Oh, and no new local cases in Queensland in case anyone was wondering. (They weren’t.) The daily numbers are out and it seems there are two new locally acquired cases. A former defence chief has blasted the approval of a $500m redevelopment of the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, reports AAP. Retired admiral Chris Barrie has been a vocal opponent of the major project, fearing it will completely undermine the national institution. On Tuesday he told ABC radio: I guess the game is over in terms of the fact it is going to happen, but I’m afraid it won’t be a memorial for very much longer. It might be a place of entertainment but in my view it will not be the place of remembrance that I grew up with. Barrie said the redevelopment would turn the memorial into a theme park. I recall the place of remembrance that I used to take visitors to as being unique around the world. To try and turn it into a theme park or a place of entertainment, whatever words we want to use, is not right. Barrie said he is most concerned that in the pursuit of a “bigger and better” attraction, future generations of Australians will lose the opportunity to quietly reflect on the country’s military history. The National Capital Authority has given the nod for early works at the memorial, including the demolition of Anzac Hall. At least 140 trees will be removed as part of the redevelopment, which will eventually be replaced by 250 native trees. The NCA, which has published a 1200-page consultation report, received 601 submissions during its consultation process, of which just three were in support. Key concerns were the need for the expansion, tree removal, the impacts on heritage values and the cost. The memorial argues the project will address constraints to the existing use of the building, improve the overall visitor and veterans’ experience and maintain its significance as a national cultural institution. Up to 30% of residents in some aged care homes have not taken up a Covid-19 vaccination, according to new data that has prompted an investigation into the high rates of non-uptake. Council on the Ageing chief executive Ian Yates said the most recent data shared with stakeholders was collated last week and showed most homes reported a refusal rate of between 5% and 15%. The data does not reveal why residents had declined the vaccine, but Yates said doctors would not have recommended it for a significant number due to underlying health conditions. The federal government was now focusing on homes with the highest levels of non-uptake to uncover why so many residents had chosen not to get vaccinated against Covid-19, he said. The minister for senior Australians and aged care services, Richard Colbeck, said: The department of health is examining overall consent data to review instances where consent rates are significantly low as part of planning for any required follow up activity with these facilities. But he said aged care facilities are responsible for supporting and obtaining residents’ consent to receive both doses of the vaccine. This includes early discussions on consent, including engagement with family and guardians, and treating general practitioners, as required. I’m sorry, I’m still laughing at the idea that Daniel Andrews would have been filming himself when he slipped on the steps. That’s wild. Coronavirus vaccines are being made available to all National Disability Insurance Scheme participants aged over 16, reports Daniel McCulloch from AAP. National cabinet has approved the rapid expansion to speed up the sluggish vaccine rollout across the vulnerable disability sector. It comes after dedicated vaccination hubs for people with disabilities, support workers and primary carers were given the green light. The disability minister, Linda Reynolds, made a statement this morning: We are working quickly to provide more locations for people to receive their vaccination in safe, accessible settings ... It is a particularly important step forward that both paid and unpaid carers of NDIS participants are now able to get the vaccination as soon as possible. The number of vaccinated NDIS participants is slowly growing. Almost 40,500 NDIS participants (16%) have received at least one dose of the vaccine. More than 7,800 NDIS participants living in group homes and aged care settings – 28% of the population – have been given at least one jab. However, people in disability care were considered the highest priority group and the vaccine rollout is still months behind schedule. Now, this fairly bold move by the Victorian opposition hasn’t gone unnoticed by the state government. Treasurer Tim Pallas has called for them to make a public apology and labelled the theories “QAnon craziness”: This is nonsense ... we know it’s nonsense. What happened to Daniel Andrews was an unfortunate but very serious spinal injury. There’s nothing more to it ... Perhaps they [the Liberals] need to issue a public apology. Oh, and by the way, the leader of the Victorian opposition, Michael O’Brien, is also involved: Yikes, some weird stuff is going on in the Victoria parliament this morning. So the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has been off for a number of months now after falling on some wet steps and fracturing his spine. Since this happened a number of conspiracy theories have been bubbling away. But now it seems the state opposition is willing to play into these bizarre rumours publicly. Here is what the shadow treasurer, Louise Staley, had to say at a press conference this morning: Nobody’s got footage of the stairs. Nobody’s got really any idea where it happened and this is a very visual world these days where we seem to have everything out there on the media but not this. (I know personally I often film myself getting ready for work. If you’re lucky I’ll release the video of me making a cup of tea at 6.45am.) When asked by AAP reporter Benita Kolovos why she was “fuelling conspiracy theories”, Staley said: Well, the easiest way to stop any of these conspiracy theories – which I’m not playing into – is for these questions to be answered. Just staying on that ABC radio interview with Nationals MP Matt Canavan for a moment. He has been asked his views on the Biloela family’s situation, saying he believes the multimillion-dollar effort to keep the family in detention is worth it to protect Australia’s borders: I think what is “worth it” is that we do have strong border protections in this country that has made sure that we don’t have the atrocious and tragic trade of people that we saw around 10 years ago ... Of all of the courts, none have found that this family has refugee status. Therefore, they do not have a right to stay in this country. Now, they have chosen with their lawyers to fight and contest that. Now that’s their right, but of course, that leaves them ... in a place of limbo, if you like ... It’s certainly tragic what’s happened here to this young girl, but, given they have been found not to have refugee status ... they really cannot stay in this country. But they also have rights here, because we are a country of rights and laws of rights to challenge and contest that, but that does take time. NSW nationals MP Matt Canavan has labelled the idea of vaccine passports “un-Australian” after the former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull said on Monday that the government should seriously consider them. The passport proposal suggests certain activities, most centrally international travel, would require proof of vaccination, but Canavan told ABC Radio this morning that this went against Australian’s human rights: The idea that [being] free to go to the movies to travel to other states of Australia is somehow a gift to be given from the government is absolutely the wrong way around. In this free and fair country that we have, we have those freedoms, they are ours, they’re not given to us or gifted to us by the governance I say, they’re rights at birth as Australian citizens. They should never or only very rarely be restricted. And I don’t see any reason why at this stage we need to introduce vaccine passports. I’m confident that we will get to a high level of vaccinations as we do with other vaccines in this country, and then we’ll be able to get on with their lives. Not everyone will be vaccinated, but it will probably cover almost all vulnerable people. A former Bunnings Warehouse on the NSW north coast will be converted over the next six weeks into the state’s second Covid-19 vaccination hub. The centre, at Belmont in Lake Macquarie, is expected to be ready to administer up to 20,000 jabs a week from mid-July. The hub is the second for NSW, which already has a centre at Homebush in Sydney’s west delivering up to 5,000 injections a day, reports AAP. Premier Gladys Berejiklian made the announcement in a statement this morning: We are planning to replicate that model in the Hunter region, so we can quickly and safely vaccinate as many people as possible across NSW. The Lake Macquarie centre will employ up to 100 nurses, 25 pharmacists or pharmacy technicians plus about 200 other support staff. About 150 people will be hard at work converting the former Bunnings site over the next six weeks before it opens to residents in the region. The centre will administer both the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines, with bookings required. Labor Senator Kristina Keneally, who visited the Biloela family on Christmas Island this year, has fronted media this morning calling on the government to “bring them home”. She spoke to ABC News Breakfast just before: The family’s lawyers have put information in front of the minister about [older daughter] Kopika and Tharnicaa’s ongoing physical and mental health impacts of detention. And this latest emergency – this acute medical emergency – is unfortunately just a most recent example of the ongoing impacts that detention is having on these two little Australian-born girls. Today, I say to the minister for home affairs, and the minister for immigration, it’s time to bring this sorry saga, what we as a country are doing to these two little Australian-born girls to an end. Bring them home to Biloela, a town who wants and loves them. Keneally said the whole family should have been allowed to travel with the three-year-old on the medevac flight, rather than just her mother, Priya: All of this heartbreak for this family. The last thing they need right now is to be separated from one another and the last thing of course is this little girl, Tharnicaa, needs, is this type of medical emergency. Just back on the Biloela family, there is some controversy about the level of medical care three-year-old Tharnicaa may have received. Advocates for the family are alleging the detention centre staff didn’t take Tharnicaa to the hospital on Christmas Island until Sunday, despite multiple requests from her mother. A spokesperson for the Department of Home Affairs said both the department and Australian Border Force were committed to the welfare of detainees in immigration detention: Healthcare services for detainees on Christmas Island are broadly comparable with those available within the Australian community under the Australian public health system ... The ABF facilitates access to nurses, doctors and specialists for all members of the family. Good morning all, It’s Matilda Boseley here, ready to dive into this very lovely Tuesday with you. First up, it’s worth talking about what’s happening to the Biloela family, the Tamil family of four being held in immigration detention on Christmas Island. The youngest daughter, three-year-old Tharnicaa, has been medically evacuated to Perth with a suspected blood infection, renewing calls from advocates for the government to let the family return to their home in rural Queensland. A medical evacuation flight carrying Tharnicaa and her mother Priya landed at Perth airport on Monday evening, advocates for the family confirmed. They say Tharnicaa had been unwell for 10 days and might have septicaemia, experienced vomiting, diarrhoea, dizziness and a temperature of more than 40 degrees. Her mum Priya has released a short statement about the situation: I am feeling very scared and worried for my little girl ... She has been sick for many days, it took a long time for her to get to the hospital. She is already asking for her papa, it is going to be very hard being away from her Dad and sister. It is very hard for our family to be separated when our daughter is sick. Back in Victoria, the state is entering its 12th day of lockdown (I type from lockdown), and all eyes are on today’s numbers. Yesterday people were alarmed to see the state record 11 new locally acquired cases on Monday, fearing this would almost guarantee a third week of “stay-at-home orders”, but it was quickly clarified in the daily press conference that new cases are all close contacts of existing cases or people who are in quarantine, and there weren’t even any fresh exposure sites relating to these cases. We usually get word on the daily number before 9am, so I’ll keep you in the loop.

Joseph Kamaru is Kenya’s Bob Dylan. The song is about a groom trying to make it to his bride-to-be while violent resistance to British colonialism by the Kenya Land Freedom Army (Mau Mau) is raging. The song evokes my home town, Limuru, best known for having a lot of donkeys and producing my father, the writer Ngugi Wa Thiong’o. Limuru is beautiful in that Kenyan, small, rough town way: dusty when it is not muddy, haphazard brightly coloured buildings and the smell of <em>nyama choma</em> (roast meat). What I love most is visiting the little bars, juke joints with music blaring Kamaru, the loud political arguments, occasional fights followed by drunken hugs and the laughter.

When I close my eyes now, I can see images of all the places I have been – but the one that shines brightest right now is Ithaca, New York, home town to Cornell University where I teach, known for its awe-inspiring waterfalls and gorges. But ultimately, Home is where Malaika is. In the early 1990s my family and I visited him in a high-rise building in Newark, New Jersey.

In my undergrad years my two good friends were anti-apartheid exiles who had seen so much before they got to Albright College in Reading, Pennsylvania. We would have parties and each night this song would play several times. In 2017 I was in Johannesburg for the city’s book fair. One night, the last time I was to see fellow writer and friend Binyavanga Wainaina alive, he took me and other writers to a rooftop party. The electricity was down in the half of the town but there was enough energy in the crowd that night to turn itback on. I could see the song in the young crowd – hip, fast-moving, political and with their fingers on the pulse of the country.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sYLORciw6g\">Chozi Lanitoka</a> by Alsarah<strong> </strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4c9ce1a86f3aeb60334caa030ca72541ea4fb785\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c9ce1a86f3aeb60334caa030ca72541ea4fb785/0_233_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People at Coco beach, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, January 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Coco beach, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, January 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ericky Boniphace/AFP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are some things that can happen only once in your life. I am in Tanzania’s capital, Dar es Salaam for the Mabati Cornell Kiswahili prize for African Literature in 2017. It is about 3am and me and my friend decide we should go check out the nightlife. We get into a cab and keep asking the driver for a spot where we can listen to live music. But he knows of no place that is open – but we insist. He drives us to a mosque – it is full of families, on the stage and around it. I learn that it’s Eid al-fitr, the break of Ramadan. And we listen to the most amazing taarab music. Dar es Salaam is the only city I have visited where it feels like the ocean is all around it, where even the slightest breeze carries the Indian Ocean and no matter how deep into it you go, the water is only a few feet away. And the taarab music tugs gently and deeply, the ebb and flow.</p> <h2>New York, New York by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De_N7Yaz2pE\">The Last Poets</a> </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2ef4ce7bf759a07ed2943dceb9ab1479d124fd98\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ef4ce7bf759a07ed2943dceb9ab1479d124fd98/0_162_5040_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Apollo Theatre on 125th Street, Harlem, New York.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Apollo Theatre in Harlem, New York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As a child growing up, we listened to this album all the time. I was born in Evanston, Illinois, but grew up in Kenya until I was 19 and came back to the US for college. My first trip to NYC was in the summer of 1990. I visited all the touristy places, but it was in Harlem where the energy was, plus it was so much like home, all that blackness after a few months of whiteness. A must-visit spot is the <a href=\"https://www.shrinenyc.com/\">Shrine</a>, inspired by Fela Kuti’s music space in Lagos. The last time I was there was 2019 and on that night there was an Ethiopian musician doing Elvis Presley covers. Eventually he did a Tizita but let’s just say he was nowhere as good as the Mandingo in Addis.</p> <h2>The Heathen by Bob Marley </h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DipcpBDFU_8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DipcpBDFU_8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Like Kamaru, Bob Marley is an artist I have known all my life – and with both of them, the more you listen, the more you will hear. I eventually found myself in Jamaica<strong> </strong>for the <a href=\"https://jakeshotel.com/jakes-experiences/calabash-international-literary-festival\">Calabash International Literary festival</a> at Treasure Beach. Having lived in the US for so long, it was good to be in a space where my blackness gave me intimacy instead of automatic suspicion. The best part of it was going for morning runs away from the beach and tourist trappings and passing by rural homes. Bob Marley is everywhere, always on radios and music systems. When I was writing my Tizita novel I listened to this song obsessively. It’s militant, for sure, but when you listen underneath it, you hear anguished love and hope.</p> <h2>Saa Magni by Oumou Sangaréb </h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8t56unTS6c\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/I8t56unTS6c?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>In 2007 I visited Mali. In a small hotel bar in Sélingué, the band was playing Malian blues. If you listen to music well it’s like learning a language – you might not speak it, but you connect through it. It was in driving from Bamako to Sélingué that I could see Oumou’s music and hear the sound, movement from city to country. The most universal of things, people loving, eating, selling goods along the roadways, the heat, the dessert and then the oasis that was Sélingué. Sélingué has an artificial dam that looks like a lake. It is a place of sublime beauty. Listening to Oumou also transports me back to 2002 when I met my wife. She had been to Mali to learn to play the balafon and she made me a CD of Malian music.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnA1awjeAhI\">Lucille</a> by Kenny Rogers </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5161a3056b6c7fb6c3a09ca244b38d245dc7ec5a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5161a3056b6c7fb6c3a09ca244b38d245dc7ec5a/0_0_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The house the author Mukoma Wa Ngugi grew up in, Limuru, Kenya.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The house the author grew up in, Limuru, Kenya.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mukoma Wa Ngugi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kenny Rogers has been a guilty pleasure at different points in my life – but not when I am in Kenya where I grew up listening to him and country music in general.

He was not doing well at all financially in spite of his song having enriched others. Blues for a Hip King by Abdullah Ibrahim I knew of this song long before I visited South Africa. In my undergrad years my two good friends were anti-apartheid exiles who had seen so much before they got to Albright College in Reading, Pennsylvania. We would have parties and each night this song would play several times. In 2017 I was in Johannesburg for the city’s book fair. One night, the last time I was to see fellow writer and friend Binyavanga Wainaina alive, he took me and other writers to a rooftop party. The electricity was down in the half of the town but there was enough energy in the crowd that night to turn itback on. I could see the song in the young crowd – hip, fast-moving, political and with their fingers on the pulse of the country. Chozi Lanitoka by Alsarah There are some things that can happen only once in your life. I am in Tanzania’s capital, Dar es Salaam for the Mabati Cornell Kiswahili prize for African Literature in 2017. It is about 3am and me and my friend decide we should go check out the nightlife. We get into a cab and keep asking the driver for a spot where we can listen to live music. But he knows of no place that is open – but we insist. He drives us to a mosque – it is full of families, on the stage and around it. I learn that it’s Eid al-fitr, the break of Ramadan. And we listen to the most amazing taarab music. Dar es Salaam is the only city I have visited where it feels like the ocean is all around it, where even the slightest breeze carries the Indian Ocean and no matter how deep into it you go, the water is only a few feet away. And the taarab music tugs gently and deeply, the ebb and flow. New York, New York by The Last Poets As a child growing up, we listened to this album all the time. I was born in Evanston, Illinois, but grew up in Kenya until I was 19 and came back to the US for college. My first trip to NYC was in the summer of 1990. I visited all the touristy places, but it was in Harlem where the energy was, plus it was so much like home, all that blackness after a few months of whiteness. A must-visit spot is the Shrine, inspired by Fela Kuti’s music space in Lagos. The last time I was there was 2019 and on that night there was an Ethiopian musician doing Elvis Presley covers. Eventually he did a Tizita but let’s just say he was nowhere as good as the Mandingo in Addis. The Heathen by Bob Marley Like Kamaru, Bob Marley is an artist I have known all my life – and with both of them, the more you listen, the more you will hear. I eventually found myself in Jamaica for the Calabash International Literary festival at Treasure Beach. Having lived in the US for so long, it was good to be in a space where my blackness gave me intimacy instead of automatic suspicion. The best part of it was going for morning runs away from the beach and tourist trappings and passing by rural homes. Bob Marley is everywhere, always on radios and music systems. When I was writing my Tizita novel I listened to this song obsessively. It’s militant, for sure, but when you listen underneath it, you hear anguished love and hope. Saa Magni by Oumou Sangaréb In 2007 I visited Mali. In a small hotel bar in Sélingué, the band was playing Malian blues. If you listen to music well it’s like learning a language – you might not speak it, but you connect through it. It was in driving from Bamako to Sélingué that I could see Oumou’s music and hear the sound, movement from city to country. The most universal of things, people loving, eating, selling goods along the roadways, the heat, the dessert and then the oasis that was Sélingué. Sélingué has an artificial dam that looks like a lake. It is a place of sublime beauty. Listening to Oumou also transports me back to 2002 when I met my wife. She had been to Mali to learn to play the balafon and she made me a CD of Malian music. Lucille by Kenny Rogers Kenny Rogers has been a guilty pleasure at different points in my life – but not when I am in Kenya where I grew up listening to him and country music in general. One day, I must have been about nine, I asked my elder brother, “Kimunya, why do we love country music so much?” His answer was seared into my memory: “We love stories, and they are telling stories.” Now, whether I’m writing a scholarly article or fiction, I tell myself I am telling a story. But imagine this, a time of the Moi dictatorship and the repression, and a bunch of high-school kids listening and singing along to Kenny and Dolly Parton, in Limuru. Sometimes a song helps us travel out of a place.

The mothers of some of the 8,000 men and boys killed in the worst act of bloodshed on European soil since the second world war are expected to gather outside the courtroom as the verdict arrives. * * * Trunk packed, check – Today’s long read tracks the story of Dumba, an elephant who has spent her life performing in circuses around Europe, but in recent years has become the subject of an animal rights campaign to have her freed. When her owners, circus family the Kludskys, found themselves caught between the demands of activists and local authorities, they stocked up her trailer with hay, loaded her in and nosed their truck out of the gate of their property outside Barcelona – and an unusual European odyssey began. Today in Focus podcast: Ultra-risky? After 21 competitors died during a 100km mountain race in Gansu province, the Chinese government last week suspended all extreme sports. But those who love ultrarunning insist it can be safe – and has changed how they see the world. What keeps them coming back? Lunchtime read: ‘A career change saved my life’ Chronic stress at work can lead to listlessness, fatigue, burnout, and a much higher risk of stroke and heart disease. But there are ways to save yourself before it’s too late. Meet people who have made a change. Sport Chris Silverwood has said he is braced to deal with any criticism should Craig Overton emerge as the player who replaces the suspended Ollie Robinson in England’s team for the second Test against New Zealand. Boris Johnson and the sports minister, Oliver Dowden, have both criticised the ECB’s decision to suspend the bowler from international cricket while it conducts an investigation into historic offensive tweets. But the prime minister refused to condemn those who booed England footballers taking a knee, as a row over the anti-racism gesture threatens to overshadow the start of Euro 2020. England manager Gareth Southgate has been spinning plates and is now desperately seeking clarity after the fog of recent friendlies took hold, writes David Hytner. Naomi Osaka has officially withdrawn from the bett1open grass court tournament next week in Berlin, an event she had intended to compete in as a warm-up before Wimbledon. At Roland Garros, Novak Djokovic saved a break point to win in the fourth round of the French Open as Rafael Nadal won after trailing early on. Kyle Sinckler has urged Warren Gatland to “put me on the field” after earning a British &amp; Irish Lions reprieve with the Bristol and England prop determined to prove he deserves his place in the squad following his late call-up. And Damian de Allende and RG Snyman, who were named last weekend in the South Africa squad to face the British &amp; Irish Lions this summer, are among four Munster players to have sustained burns in a fire pit accident. Business Stocks have edged lower in the Asia-Pacific region after a mixed finish on Wall Street, as investors weighed the risks of inflation against signs the recovery from the pandemic is gaining momentum. Benchmarks fell in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Shanghai and were flat in Seoul. The FTSE is trending flat to down a couple of points before it opens. A pound is worth $1.416 or €1.162 at time of writing. The papers The Guardian print edition leads today with “Johnson facing humiliation over foreign aid cuts before G7 summit”. On Tuesday, senior figures including Theresa May are expected to line up to condemn the cuts in an hours-long emergency debate. Johnson appears on a collision course with his own MPs, with No 10 suggesting it will defy an order by the Speaker to bring a vote on the cuts. The Times splashes with a consequential prediction: “Lockdown lifting set to be delayed by fortnight”. Its front also has Keira Knightley saying every woman she knows has been harassed – same goes for the Metro though its lead story is “NHStress” as in NHS stress, about that committee report which we cover here. “Vaccines winning variant battle” proclaims the i, and the Mirror says “Virus jabs – we are on the home straight”. Everyone aged 25 and over in England will be invited to get a coronavirus vaccine from Tuesday. The Express reports “Alzheimer’s drug brings fresh hope” – no one can resist a good news story right now, but they may be taking it a bit far since there are question marks over whether aducanumab actually works. “Europe threatens sausage trade war” – a nicely confected story hook from those silly sausages at the Telegraph, about the Northern Ireland protocol (the accompanying Telegraph column by the European Commission president does not appear to mention sausages). The Mail’s lead story is “Monster who killed our girls must never be freed”, about Colin Pitchfork who has been cleared for release on parole after 33 years. The Financial Times reports “G7 eyes tax on Amazon by tapping lucrative cloud computing divisions”. The Sun’s lead is “Harry takes 5 months orf”, calling it an “earache break for world”.

Dumba went willingly, as always; it was her owners who dragged their feet. The family had spent much of their lives on the road, but this time they did not know how long they would be gone, or if they would ever return.</p> <p>The Kludskys’ home is on the outskirts of Caldes de Montbui, a spa town north of Barcelona. Set amid farmland and hills, the property forms part of a secluded residential development. Until recently, they had spent at least half of the year, travelling across Europe with Dumba, performing in circuses and zoos or hiring her out for media work – including a TV ad in which she <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAA7iv2VFjE\" title=\"\">lumbered</a> gracefully across a mattress to demonstrate the product’s durability (“A Pikolin can take anything”). Yvonne, whose professional name is Yvonne Kruse, is a fourth-generation circus performer, while George is sixth-generation circus, and they have worked with Dumba for 41 years, since she was brought to Europe from Asia at the age of two. “She is our daughter and we are her herd,” Kruse likes to say.</p> <p>When the family was at home, their “daughter” lived in an outdoor pen of about 500 sq metres – the size of two tennis courts – surrounded by an electric fence. To give Dumba exercise they would lead her into an adjacent patch of oak forest where she could forage and wander. Visiting the Kludskys in June 2018, the journalist Albert San Andrés <a href=\"http://www.calderi.cat/2018/06/dumba-lelefanta-caldes/\" title=\"\">found</a> that the neighbours were delighted to have an elephant next door – their local “diva”, as one put it – and children would come out from the nearby town to see her. But the Kludskys told Andrés that animal rights activists were making the family’s life hell.</p> <p>In the early 2010s, a Spanish animal rights organisation, Faada, had begun petitioning the Spanish authorities to take Dumba away from the Kludskys, on the basis that it was cruel to keep her in such a small enclosure with no other elephants for company. In 2014, the authorities duly inspected the property and recommended some improvements. The Kludskys, they said, should provide Dumba with shelter and a pond to bathe in, as well as more “environmental enrichment” – or psychological stimulation. Faada staff and volunteers continued to photograph and film Dumba from the Kludskys’ perimeter fence. There were further inspections culminating in a visit in July 2018, again commissioned by the authorities, of a team of experts in elephant welfare. They reported that, although Dumba now had a tent, her outdoor enclosure was too small, her shade was inadequate and she still had no bathing pool.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4e4cbffcf9eb162638c802e71393268728d9a022\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e4cbffcf9eb162638c802e71393268728d9a022/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dumba at the switching on of some Christmas lights in Paris in 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dumba at the switching on of some Christmas lights in Paris in 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bertrand Rindoff Petroff/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the authorities took no action, and the Kludskys continued to tour in Spain and France, where circuses that feature animal acts can still draw a crowd. Kruse sometimes dressed up in sparkling gowns and turbans, and Dumba <a href=\"http://bucklesw.blogspot.com/2009/03/yvonne-kludsky-1-from-don-covington.html\" title=\"\">wore</a> matching bracelets. At shows, the elephant, who weighs three and a half tonnes, would kneel on command and stand on her hind legs. She <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZEUnnPFYgY\" title=\"\">twirled</a> her trunk and drop-kicked balls for treats, then posed for photos at €10 a go.</p> <p>In recent years, circus families like the Kludskys have come under increasing pressure as public opinion has turned against the use of wild animals for entertainment. Today, many circus elephants in Europe are reaching old age. Campaigners want them placed in specially built sanctuaries, where they can enjoy retirement with their own kind. But their owners insist that for the elephants, being separated from their human “families” would be traumatic. The Kludskys and their supporters feel they are accused of cruelty by people who know nothing about the lifelong bond between elephants and their trainers, or the elephant’s pleasure in learning new tricks. The two sides are implacably opposed.</p> <p>When Covid-19 broke out across Europe, the Kludskys left a circus in Zaragoza to sit out the pandemic at home. There was no more work but, while Spain was under strict lockdown, at least there was no more scrutiny either. They shielded: Kruse took care of the shopping while George went no further than the nearest farm to fetch Dumba’s hay. Then, in August 2020, Faada changed tack. Instead of focusing on Dumba’s welfare, they turned their attention to the risk Dumba might pose to the public.</p> <p>The organisation told Spanish authorities that the Kludskys were breaching security regulations. An elephant, being a potentially dangerous animal, had to be enclosed by a thick-barred steel fence. But the local council refused the Kludskys permission to build an unsightly elephant fence in a scenic rural zone. That was the double bind the family found itself in last September. And that’s when they decided that their next act would be to disappear. They stocked up Dumba’s trailer with hay, filled the water tank, loaded her in and heaved up the ramp behind her. Then they nosed the truck slowly out of the gate and travelled north.</p> <p>When Faada campaigners learned what had happened, they were furious. On 27 September, the group lambasted the Spanish authorities on Twitter for their inertia. In failing to confiscate the elephant, they argued, the authorities had forfeited Dumba’s last chance to see out her final years in peace and comfort. Míriam Martínez, the head of Faada’s wild animal division, was upset that the Kludskys had given them the slip. “We did not want that to happen,” she said, gravely. But she knew the elephant couldn’t stay hidden for long.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>A lorry carrying an elephant doesn’t move very fast. Still, it took no more than a day to travel the 400km to the Kludskys’ destination, crossing from Spain into France just south of Perpignan and hugging the Mediterranean coast as far as Montpellier, before travelling north into the rural Gard region. When they rolled into the tiny village of Euzet, in the foothills of the Cévennes mountain range, the locals were expecting them.</p> <p>“I was informed that the elephant was going to be here about 28 September,” Cyril Ozil, mayor of Euzet, told me recently. It had been Ozil’s responsibility to check that the paperwork for a wild animal in transit was in order. He knew the family had a friend living locally and had come through with Dumba before. The Kludskys set up camp on their friend’s 30-hectare property, parking their unmarked trailer next to Dumba’s tent.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5b35c6bfcff4af2fb6d03dbed50f9244faa4e458\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b35c6bfcff4af2fb6d03dbed50f9244faa4e458/0_0_3307_2205/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yvonne Kruse with Dumba at their former home in Caldes de Montbui, north of Barcelona.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yvonne Kruse with Dumba at their former home in Caldes de Montbui, north of Barcelona.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anna Mas</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Kludskys settled into a new rhythm. Each day, George and Martyn accompanied their friend on a tractor to fetch hay from the next village. Dumba eats around 65kg of it a day, supplemented by alfalfa, cereals, vegetables and fruit. She is a picky eater, but loves bananas, which she eats by the bunch. The Kludskys took her for daily walks, having the run of their friend’s fields, vineyards, olive groves and woods. When necessary they guided Dumba with the elephant keeper’s traditional tool, the ankus, essentially a pointed stick with a hook. Most of the time, though, Kruse said Dumba chose where to go. Occasionally, she stopped to tear up tufts of grass with her trunk, or snap off branches of evergreen oak. At night, Yvonne and George slept in the house while Martyn bedded down next to Dumba in the tent. “She is used to having at least one of us nearby,” Kruse told me.</p> <p>The Kludskys had hoped to find work in a zoo or safari park, then think about selling the Caldes property to buy another where they could live legally with Dumba. “We did not count on Covid complicating our lives so very much,” Kruse said. When a new lockdown began in October, they hunkered down.</p> <p>Euzet, which has about 450 inhabitants, is a slash of limestone against a mat of dark green. The locals are <em>taiseux</em> – they don’t say much – and they have a tradition of supporting the underdog. For months, word of Dumba’s presence did not spread far beyond the village. But then, when they were out for their stroll one day in early January, the Kludskys came across some hikers. By the nature of their questions, Kruse guessed that one of them was an animal rights activist. “I remember saying to my husband at the time, ‘Oh here we go, that’s the end of our peace and quiet,’ and sure enough I was right. It was the beginning of a very vocal, organised and international campaign against us,” she told me.</p> <p>On 18 January, One Voice, a French organisation that works with Faada, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/onevoiceanimal/status/1351512563574566914\" title=\"\">announced</a> to their followers on Twitter: “We have found Dumba on a rubbish tip in the Gard. Exploited, kept in a lorry, her life is emblematic of every circus animal’s … this suffering must stop!” The organisation filed a complaint to the public prosecutor in the nearby town of Alès, citing animal mistreatment. Having ordered a veterinary inspection, the prosecutor declared himself satisfied that the elephant was well cared for, but he didn’t publish the vet’s report – and despite pressure from One Voice, he still hasn’t.</p> <p>Frustrated by the prosecutor’s failure to act, One Voice commissioned other vets to examine video footage of Dumba. The vets had some concerns about her health: she was too thin, had dry, scurfy skin and was probably suffering from joint pain, they said. The pop star Cher, who co-founded the animal welfare charity Free the Wild, <a href=\"https://one-voice.fr/en/blog/a-new-stage-in-our-attempts-to-get-dumba-out-of-the-circus.html\" title=\"\">wrote</a> to the French minister Barbara Pompili, who was deliberating on whether to ban wild animals in circuses, asking her to end Dumba’s “daily torment”. Pompili <a href=\"https://twitter.com/barbarapompili/status/1351618436733005833\" title=\"\">replied</a>, expressing noncommittal sympathy (“a judicial inquiry is under way”).</p> <p>People dug up old photos of the family going about their business, and posted their protests on social media: “This is #Dumba being hosed down in a parking lot. Seriously? Concrete for an elephant you have already crippled? Just another example of how Dumba is being abused by the Kludskys and their pathetic staff, we need to get her away from them now.”</p> <p>Once the family’s location had been made public, a steady stream of journalists and the simply curious tramped out to Dumba’s camp, just beyond the village proper, and the Kludskys greeted them politely. When I turned up in early February, Kruse was cordial, if a little wary. It was a cool, sunny afternoon. Emerging from the transporter’s cab wearing jeans and a warm jacket, she led me inside the tent and up to the electric wire that marked off the elephant’s 10 x 8 metre pen. Instinctively, as Dumba’s trainer, she placed herself between the animal and her audience. Female Asian elephants have a reputation for moodiness, but everyone I have spoken to who has met Dumba has described her as calm and docile.</p> <p>She is nearly 3 metres tall. I gazed up into her amber eyes, and she flapped her ears and waved her trunk, which like her ears is speckled pink, in what seemed like a joyful welcome. George – diminutive, muscular, all smiles – climbed down from the trailer to say hello. Czech by origin, he let his wife do the talking, and by then her talk was resentful. When Dumba lifted one foot, as if offering to shake hands, Yvonne clicked her tongue. “<em>They’ll</em> tell you she does that because it relieves her joint pain,” she said, referring to the animal rights activists. “But we taught her that trick years ago.” She blamed One Voice for putting her family’s health at risk by undermining their attempts to shield from Covid.</p> <p>It’s hard for a non-expert to know if an elephant is healthy or happy, but mayor Ozil – no expert himself, he’s quick to admit – was present during the official vet’s inspection that took place while Dumba was in Euzet. “If the vet had confirmed the association’s charges, I would have been the first to ensure that she was removed from her jailers,” he said. “That wasn’t the case.”</p> <p>By then, his office was receiving hate mail. “Please let Mayor Cyril Ozil know how you feel about his complacency with Dumba’s suffering and his support towards Dumba’s abusers,” one animal rights campaigner tweeted on 26 January. The residents of Euzet did not appreciate this, or the false media reports that Dumba was living in a landfill and that the Kludskys had fled a lawsuit for animal mistreatment in Spain. “Everyone in Euzet who saw the elephant was shocked by what they read in the press,” Ozil said. Many locals felt that the harried family should be left in peace.</p> <p>While One Voice’s complaint was being investigated, the Kludskys had to stay in Euzet, but on 20 February, shortly after the complaint was dismissed, they vanished again – leaving just a square of yellowed grass where Dumba’s tent had been. A day or two later, Ozil received a text message saying that they had arrived safely at their new destination: “Dumba ate almost the whole way as usual … Thank you for everything. Yvonne, George and Martyn.” Even if Ozil knew where they’d gone, he told me, he wouldn’t say.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>As something close to circus royalty, Yvonne Kruse represents a proud tradition brought low in the court of public opinion. In 2021, she is a pariah, but 70 years ago, her parents were the height of glamour. Kruse’s Swedish-born father, Gösta Kruse, trained elephants for the Bertram Mills Circus, the UK’s biggest postwar circus, in its big-top heyday of the 50s and 60s. The high point of his career, he wrote in his memoir Trunk Call, came in 1952, when a young Queen Elizabeth II watched his elephants perform at London’s Olympia. Kruse’s mother, Liverpudlian Joan Fowles, also worked for the same circus – her speciality was riding cantering horses standing up, each foot on the back of a different horse – and on the day the couple married in Southport, then part of Lancashire, in 1955, they rode past admiring crowds on an elephant named Jennie. A year later, their daughter Yvonne was born. An elephant <a href=\"https://www.gettyimages.ch/detail/nachrichtenfoto/circus-baby-yvonne-kruse-is-pushed-in-her-pram-by-kam-nachrichtenfoto/3069022?language=fr\" title=\"\">pushed</a> her pram, and she was <a href=\"https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-1962-she-is-only-two-but-she-trains-real-live-elephants-yvonne-kruse-94645034.html\" title=\"\">photographed</a> aged two with three of them stacked above her.</p> <p>But around the time the Bertram Mills Circus was drawing its biggest crowds, a quiet revolution was beginning in the science of animal cognition. Studies were leading to the recognition that some animal species were capable of complex mental operations and feelings. They were not as different from humans as had once been thought. Over the next few decades, observers of elephant behaviour discovered that elephants can identify each other at up to 2km distance, by picking up very low-frequency sounds. They reported that an adult female knows the voices of up to 100 others, and remembers them for years. A daughter stays with her mother until her death, which she <a href=\"https://www.elephantvoices.org/elephant-ethogram/ethogram-table/behaviorconstellation/94.html?cvid=MjY3MywyNjc0LDI2NzU=\" title=\"\">grieves</a> – guarding the body in silence, for example, or covering it with leaves. Elephants are empathic and loyal, intelligent and sociable. They’re also self-aware, being among the few big-brained animals that can recognise themselves in a mirror. And though elephants have been tamed, they have never been domesticated in the sense of being selectively bred, like dogs or horses. “Tamed” is a relative term, too: “They can’t habituate to small spaces,” says the elephant researcher Joyce Poole.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"edb9e736390e022c227248f66c6a357d7d25243e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/edb9e736390e022c227248f66c6a357d7d25243e/189_316_3078_3847/800.jpg\" alt=\"Yvonne Kruse aged two, training with an elephant at Bertram Mills Circus in 1958.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yvonne Kruse aged two, training with an elephant at Bertram Mills Circus in 1958.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Keystone Press/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These revelations jarred with people’s knowledge of how circus animals were kept, and the cruel way in which they were often taken from their mothers in infancy and kept in isolation. In the UK, which led the way in changing public perceptions, there were orchestrated campaigns against animal acts in circuses from the early 80s. Circus supremo Gerry Cottle, whose first job was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/jan/29/gerry-cottle-obituary\" title=\"\">“shovelling up elephant shit”</a>, sold his last elephant in 1993 and eventually supported a ban, on the grounds that animal acts were now giving circus a bad name. That ban, the Wild Animals in Circuses Act 2019, came <a href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2019/24/enacted\" title=\"\">into effect</a> last year. Dozens of European countries have now <a href=\"https://www.four-paws.org/campaigns-topics/topics/wild-animals/worldwide-circus-bans\" title=\"\">prohibited</a> wild animals in circuses. Germany and Spain are notable exceptions, with local but not nationwide bans, while France announced last year that it would phase out animals in travelling circuses.</p> <p>The problem is what to do with the animals that remain. According to the <a href=\"https://www.elefanten-schutz-europa.de/en/\" title=\"\">European Elephant Group</a> (EEG), based in Germany, there are just shy of 100 circus elephants left in Europe. Elephants can live to 70, though their life expectancy tends to be significantly shorter in captivity. Most that remain in Europe are middle-aged or older. These are the animals that concern Muriel Arnal, the president of One Voice. She is now in her 50s, and lives in Brittany. Her passion for rescuing began when she was on holiday at the French seaside aged about 10, and saw an elephant in a parked circus lorry. The presence of a large, exotic animal in a cage shocked her. “Every day I filled my backpack with bread and walked 2 or 3km to give it to him,” she told me. Though she studied business administration at university, when it came to choosing a career she decided to follow her idol, Dian Fossey, and devote her life to animals.</p> <p>Arnal set up One Voice in 1995, and scored a notable victory five years later when she had a chimpanzee called Achille removed from a circus and sent to an ape sanctuary. After that, she turned her attention to lions, tigers and elephants. Today, One Voice has about 17,000 supporters, whom she refers to as “non-violent warriors”, and she campaigns tirelessly against animal cruelty in any form – hunting, fur, experimentation, circuses. She wants France to ban animal performing of all kinds, not just travelling circuses. There is something quasi-religious about the way Arnal discusses her calling; she talks a lot, patiently and calmly, about the “martyrdom” of animals, and their “despair”.</p> <p>While Arnal considers people who make their living from performing animals unfit to look after them, William Kerwich, president of the French <a href=\"https://www.voofla.com/XX/Unknown/107054350720796/Syndicat-Fran%C3%A7ais-des-capacitaires-d%27Animaux-de-Cirque-et-Spectacle\" title=\"\">union</a> representing animal trainers, insists no one is better qualified to care for an animal than the trainer who has known it all its life. He is deeply suspicious of the do-gooders who set up animal retirement homes paid for by donations from a public who, he suggests, have been duped into thinking that all circus folk are animal torturers. “If there were to be a ban – and we’re not there yet – it is out of the question that our animals should go to a sanctuary where there is no one competent to look after them,” he said. The union, Kerwich told me, was standing squarely behind Yvonne Kruse.</p> <p>What ageing elephants need, says Scott Blais, is space, autonomy and the company of other elephants. Blais, who set up a sanctuary in Tennessee in 1995 and another in Brazil in 2016, keeps elephants in a setting as close as possible to conditions in the wild, and says previous owners who have returned to visit their old elephants often marvel at their transformation. It was at the Tennessee sanctuary that workers witnessed the extraordinary reunion of two former circus elephants, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-77wtMxT3-M\" title=\"\">Shirley and Jenny</a>, in 1999. The two had spent one season together at a circus when Jenny was a calf. After a separation of more than 20 years, they recognised each other and bent the steel bars of an elephant fence in their eagerness to get close to each other. They became inseparable, and for seven years, until Jenny died in 2006, their relationship was like that of mother and daughter.</p> <p>Elephants have shown they can retain a bond with humans, too. Joyce Poole recalled her reunion with a wild African elephant after 12 years. When she called out to him, he recognised her voice, walked up to her car window, and “allowed her to touch him”, she said. Elephants also kill humans, in captivity and in their ever-shrinking natural habitat, but these numbers are tiny compared to the numbers of elephants killed by humans <a href=\"https://wwf.panda.org/discover/knowledge_hub/endangered_species/elephants/human_elephant_conflict/\" title=\"\">each year</a>.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>‘Where is Dumba now?” pleaded a One Voice supporter on Twitter on 21 March. “Is there any way to know if she is safe?” It was a month since the Kludskys had left Euzet. It wasn’t just animal rights activists who wanted to know where the Kludskys and Dumba had gone. So, too, did the couple behind a new elephant sanctuary in south-west France.</p> <p>In 2011, seeing that bans on wild animals in circuses were looming across Europe and realising that rescued animals would need somewhere to go, two Belgian elephant keepers at Antwerp zoo decided to set up the continent’s first elephant sanctuary. Supported by donations, including from animal protection organisations such as One Voice and the Brigitte Bardot Foundation, Sofie Goetghebeur and her partner, Tony Verhulst, bought 28 hectares of rolling woodland in France’s Périgord-Limousin regional natural park, and created <a href=\"https://www.elephanthaven.com/en/home\" title=\"\">Elephant Haven</a>.</p> <p>The first phase of the sanctuary’s construction was completed in July 2020, and when I visited recently, Goetghebeur and Verhulst gave me a tour. The design of Elephant Haven is based on what science tells us about how best to manage elephants in captivity. There is a large wooden barn big enough to accommodate three elephants, complete with an elephant fence, a thick carpet of sand and a dispensary for medical attention. Seven hectares of the property have been fenced off for elephants to roam in, and video surveillance has been installed. There is an orchard to supply the elephants with fruit, and an underground spring, which is important as elephants can drink more than 100 litres a day, and like to bathe. There are mud pools for wallowing, and log walls for back-scratching.</p> <p>There is just one problem: there are no elephants. Ten years after their dream was conceived, Goetghebeur and Verhulst have no rescues to show for it. They knew that the first elephant would be the hardest. An elephant’s human “family” was bound to be reluctant to part with it if the sanctuary had no elephant company to offer. But isolated in their rural idyll, Goetghebeur and Verhulst, who are not yet 50, seemed tired and demoralised. Their sponsors, they admitted, were getting impatient. “Everyone wants to know when the elephants will come,” Goetghebeur sighed.</p> <p>For years, she and Verhulst tried to make contact with the Freiwald circus family in the Netherlands, owners of that country’s most famous elephant, Buba, but they never got a reply. The Dutch banned wild animals from circuses in 2015, but an exception was made for Buba because at the time there was no obvious home for her. Last December, after a political tussle involving the Dutch agriculture minister, it <a href=\"https://www.hollandtimes.nl/articles/national/buba-the-elephant-can-stay-in-the-netherlands/\" title=\"\">was decided</a> that Buba should remain with the Freiwalds.</p> <p>The pair had no more luck with Longleat safari park in the UK, which they hoped to persuade to part with its only elephant, Anne, who is in her 60s or possibly even older. In 2011, Anne was removed from a site near Peterborough belonging to a circus, after an organisation called Animal Defenders International secretly filmed her being beaten by a handler. Longleat took her in, and 10 years later she is <a href=\"https://www.longleat.co.uk/news/anne_the_elephant_moves_in_to_new_home\" title=\"\">still there</a>, pampered but with no company apart from three Nubian goats.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"118c3b745fca71e823fb91acb389d1cfaa9de43b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/118c3b745fca71e823fb91acb389d1cfaa9de43b/0_0_3120_2076/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anne the elephant at Longleat safari park in 2011.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anne the elephant at Longleat safari park in 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Birchall/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Anne’s rescue had been organised by vet Jonathan Cracknell, who told me her previous owner continued to worry about her welfare long after he had been convicted of maltreating her. “If the weather forecast said rain, he’d ring up and give my team advice,” he said. (The judge acknowledged that the owner loved animals and that he had not been aware of the abuse.) Cracknell left Longleat in 2016, since when a small grassroots group called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/13/have-a-go-heroes-the-women-saving-elephants-in-their-free-time\" title=\"\">Action for Elephants UK</a> has been lobbying Longleat to release Anne to the French sanctuary, but so far the safari park has resisted all such calls. In a <a href=\"https://www.longleat.co.uk/news/anne---not-just-another-elephant\" title=\"\">statement</a>, Longleat warned of the high risks involved in “uprooting her from familiar surroundings and people she has learned to trust, and transporting her to a new, unknown location with the prospect of being left in the company of other elephants she does not know”.</p> <p>Anne often sways – a form of repetitive behaviour indicating psychological disturbance, thought to stem from past bullying by humans and other elephants. Joyce Poole, who has studied elephants in the wild for more than 40 years, told me there was no reason Anne couldn’t still form an attachment to another elephant, as long as the introductions were handled properly. But there is also her advanced age to consider: if she were to die en route to France, Longleat would probably get the blame. It’s genuinely difficult to know what’s best for Anne now, said Cracknell.</p> <p>When I visited Goetghebeur and Verhulst in March, they were still hoping to bring Anne and Dumba to Elephant Haven. But their approaches to Kruse – through Facebook, and a letter delivered via an intermediary – were met with silence. Goetghebeur and Verhulst realised they were up against a “gentleman’s agreement” within the circus community not to send them an animal. As far as Kruse was concerned, Elephant Haven was backed by people who had tried to “kidnap” Dumba.</p> <p>As I was leaving the sanctuary, Verhulst shared a last thought: “The worst thing is they argue they are really attached to her, but she is for sale. You can buy Dumba if you want.” Photographs and emails have circulated online suggesting that Dumba was for sale as recently as September 2020, for €180,000. When I asked Kruse about this, she denied it. “We were offered €200,000 some years ago but declined. That is not our way.”</p> <p>Whatever the truth, Kruse’s claim that she loves Dumba like a daughter is certainly complicated by the fact that the elephant is the family’s main source of income. “Yes the animals are dear in the dollar sense, but that’s all,” said Arnal. “The trainers who mistreat them and keep them in abject conditions – as in Dumba’s case – have no affection for them.”</p> <p>Kruse said in an email to me that Covid had been a financial disaster for the family. They had had no government support and were living off savings and the generosity of family and friends. “I find it ironic,” she said, “that the associations which are supposedly trying to help and save the animals never once got in contact with us to offer a bale of hay or sack of carrots.”</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Over the first weekend in April, news broke that Dumba had resurfaced in Germany. After the Kludskys left Euzet, Muriel Arnal told me, One Voice had dispatched investigators to tail their vehicle. “We had lost Dumba once, it was out of the question that we should lose her again,” she said. On 2 April, they announced the elephant’s new whereabouts: the Kludskys had left Dumba in a wildlife park between Berlin and Hamburg. The photo the organisation released seemed to show Dumba in a bare prison cell – though the bars containing her were those of an elephant fence, the likes of which the Spanish authorities had demanded the Kludskys install in Caldes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2021/06/elephant_map/giv-825v0z6CvqXaBeE/\" data-alt=\"Dumba's journey\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2021/06/elephant_map/giv-825v0z6CvqXaBeE/\">Dumba's journey</a> </figure>  <p>Dumba’s new home, the Elefantenhof Platschow, is run by Sonni Frankello, scion of a German circus dynasty. Comprising an old farm with stables, barns and green space, it hosts a range of animals including a dozen elephants, which occupy three of its seven hectares. The public pays to see, feed and ride the elephants, and though the animals don’t tour, they do perform and they can be hired out for events.</p> <p>The Kludskys stayed with Frankello’s family for 10 days in late February – “to see that the transition went smoothly”, Kruse said – then returned home to Spain to allow Dumba to complete her integration. By the time they left, Kruse and Frankello said Dumba had started bonding with another elephant called Susi who arrived at around the same time, from a Spanish circus. The two were introduced via a shared paddock where a cable separated them initially, until it was considered safe to remove it. By early April, Dumba and Susi were mixing freely, and being introduced slowly to some of the other elephants.</p> <p>Neither Kruse nor Frankello would say if Frankello had paid for Dumba, but Kruse told me the move was permanent – that they had done what they thought was best for Dumba, in the circumstances – and that her family were desperately missing their daughter: “The first cut of hay in the fields, not having to buy all those apples and carrots when I go shopping, not being able to sit by her when reading or my husband not going for a last muck out, more hay for the night and a cuddle around midnight remind us constantly of our loss.”</p> <p>One Voice is keeping up its campaign for Kruse to be prosecuted for mistreatment. They are still trying to persuade the Alès prosecutor to publish the report of the vet who inspected Dumba in Euzet, so that they can use it to support the lawsuit. While Dumba continues to suffer, Arnal told me, they won’t give up. On the Kludskys’ side, Kerwich, the animal trainers’ representative in France, used the same words – “<em>On ne lachera pas</em>” – we won’t give up.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jun/02/kill-them-the-volunteer-army-plotting-to-wipe-out-britains-grey-squirrels\">‘Kill them, kill them, kill them’: the volunteer army plotting to wipe out Britain’s grey squirrels</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When he felt she was ready, Frankello planned to resume teaching Dumba to perform tricks, adapting to her age and aptitudes. “I know she is good at football,” he said. “She is also very good with her trunk, so perhaps I’ll teach her to do jigsaw puzzles.” Like many circus people, Frankello sees training as the highest form of enrichment, and believes that circus elephants get mental stimulation from performance and enjoy attention and applause. Covid rules were strict this spring, in the German state where the Elefantenhof is situated, and he had weeks to hone her drop-kick before the first vaccinated visitors arrived in May, to watch and laugh and clap. </p> <p>• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, listen to our podcasts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/the-long-read\" title=\"\">here</a> and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"6","wordcount":"5034","displayHint":"immersive","firstPublicationDate":"2021-06-08T05:00:12Z","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2021-06-08T05:00:12Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2021-06-08T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"The Guardian","shortUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/p/hybk3","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd6d0cc5f4de60c97176bb2816ed792a97fff88c/0_241_3612_2167/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","isLive":"true","bodyText":"One day in late September 2020, the Kludsky family – Yvonne, a slim, blond woman in her 60s, her husband, George, who is over 80 but still fit and strong, and their son Martyn – led their elephant up a ramp into the 10-metre trailer that constituted her second home. Dumba went willingly, as always; it was her owners who dragged their feet. The family had spent much of their lives on the road, but this time they did not know how long they would be gone, or if they would ever return. The Kludskys’ home is on the outskirts of Caldes de Montbui, a spa town north of Barcelona. Set amid farmland and hills, the property forms part of a secluded residential development. Until recently, they had spent at least half of the year, travelling across Europe with Dumba, performing in circuses and zoos or hiring her out for media work – including a TV ad in which she lumbered gracefully across a mattress to demonstrate the product’s durability (“A Pikolin can take anything”). Yvonne, whose professional name is Yvonne Kruse, is a fourth-generation circus performer, while George is sixth-generation circus, and they have worked with Dumba for 41 years, since she was brought to Europe from Asia at the age of two. “She is our daughter and we are her herd,” Kruse likes to say. When the family was at home, their “daughter” lived in an outdoor pen of about 500 sq metres – the size of two tennis courts – surrounded by an electric fence. To give Dumba exercise they would lead her into an adjacent patch of oak forest where she could forage and wander. Visiting the Kludskys in June 2018, the journalist Albert San Andrés found that the neighbours were delighted to have an elephant next door – their local “diva”, as one put it – and children would come out from the nearby town to see her. But the Kludskys told Andrés that animal rights activists were making the family’s life hell. In the early 2010s, a Spanish animal rights organisation, Faada, had begun petitioning the Spanish authorities to take Dumba away from the Kludskys, on the basis that it was cruel to keep her in such a small enclosure with no other elephants for company. In 2014, the authorities duly inspected the property and recommended some improvements. The Kludskys, they said, should provide Dumba with shelter and a pond to bathe in, as well as more “environmental enrichment” – or psychological stimulation. Faada staff and volunteers continued to photograph and film Dumba from the Kludskys’ perimeter fence. There were further inspections culminating in a visit in July 2018, again commissioned by the authorities, of a team of experts in elephant welfare. They reported that, although Dumba now had a tent, her outdoor enclosure was too small, her shade was inadequate and she still had no bathing pool. But the authorities took no action, and the Kludskys continued to tour in Spain and France, where circuses that feature animal acts can still draw a crowd. Kruse sometimes dressed up in sparkling gowns and turbans, and Dumba wore matching bracelets. At shows, the elephant, who weighs three and a half tonnes, would kneel on command and stand on her hind legs. She twirled her trunk and drop-kicked balls for treats, then posed for photos at €10 a go. In recent years, circus families like the Kludskys have come under increasing pressure as public opinion has turned against the use of wild animals for entertainment. Today, many circus elephants in Europe are reaching old age. Campaigners want them placed in specially built sanctuaries, where they can enjoy retirement with their own kind. But their owners insist that for the elephants, being separated from their human “families” would be traumatic. The Kludskys and their supporters feel they are accused of cruelty by people who know nothing about the lifelong bond between elephants and their trainers, or the elephant’s pleasure in learning new tricks. The two sides are implacably opposed. When Covid-19 broke out across Europe, the Kludskys left a circus in Zaragoza to sit out the pandemic at home. There was no more work but, while Spain was under strict lockdown, at least there was no more scrutiny either. They shielded: Kruse took care of the shopping while George went no further than the nearest farm to fetch Dumba’s hay. Then, in August 2020, Faada changed tack. Instead of focusing on Dumba’s welfare, they turned their attention to the risk Dumba might pose to the public. The organisation told Spanish authorities that the Kludskys were breaching security regulations. An elephant, being a potentially dangerous animal, had to be enclosed by a thick-barred steel fence. But the local council refused the Kludskys permission to build an unsightly elephant fence in a scenic rural zone. That was the double bind the family found itself in last September. And that’s when they decided that their next act would be to disappear. They stocked up Dumba’s trailer with hay, filled the water tank, loaded her in and heaved up the ramp behind her. Then they nosed the truck slowly out of the gate and travelled north. When Faada campaigners learned what had happened, they were furious. On 27 September, the group lambasted the Spanish authorities on Twitter for their inertia. In failing to confiscate the elephant, they argued, the authorities had forfeited Dumba’s last chance to see out her final years in peace and comfort. Míriam Martínez, the head of Faada’s wild animal division, was upset that the Kludskys had given them the slip. “We did not want that to happen,” she said, gravely. But she knew the elephant couldn’t stay hidden for long. * * * A lorry carrying an elephant doesn’t move very fast. Still, it took no more than a day to travel the 400km to the Kludskys’ destination, crossing from Spain into France just south of Perpignan and hugging the Mediterranean coast as far as Montpellier, before travelling north into the rural Gard region. When they rolled into the tiny village of Euzet, in the foothills of the Cévennes mountain range, the locals were expecting them. “I was informed that the elephant was going to be here about 28 September,” Cyril Ozil, mayor of Euzet, told me recently. It had been Ozil’s responsibility to check that the paperwork for a wild animal in transit was in order. He knew the family had a friend living locally and had come through with Dumba before. The Kludskys set up camp on their friend’s 30-hectare property, parking their unmarked trailer next to Dumba’s tent. The Kludskys settled into a new rhythm. Each day, George and Martyn accompanied their friend on a tractor to fetch hay from the next village. Dumba eats around 65kg of it a day, supplemented by alfalfa, cereals, vegetables and fruit. She is a picky eater, but loves bananas, which she eats by the bunch. The Kludskys took her for daily walks, having the run of their friend’s fields, vineyards, olive groves and woods. When necessary they guided Dumba with the elephant keeper’s traditional tool, the ankus, essentially a pointed stick with a hook. Most of the time, though, Kruse said Dumba chose where to go. Occasionally, she stopped to tear up tufts of grass with her trunk, or snap off branches of evergreen oak. At night, Yvonne and George slept in the house while Martyn bedded down next to Dumba in the tent. “She is used to having at least one of us nearby,” Kruse told me. The Kludskys had hoped to find work in a zoo or safari park, then think about selling the Caldes property to buy another where they could live legally with Dumba. “We did not count on Covid complicating our lives so very much,” Kruse said. When a new lockdown began in October, they hunkered down. Euzet, which has about 450 inhabitants, is a slash of limestone against a mat of dark green. The locals are taiseux – they don’t say much – and they have a tradition of supporting the underdog. For months, word of Dumba’s presence did not spread far beyond the village. But then, when they were out for their stroll one day in early January, the Kludskys came across some hikers. By the nature of their questions, Kruse guessed that one of them was an animal rights activist. “I remember saying to my husband at the time, ‘Oh here we go, that’s the end of our peace and quiet,’ and sure enough I was right. It was the beginning of a very vocal, organised and international campaign against us,” she told me. On 18 January, One Voice, a French organisation that works with Faada, announced to their followers on Twitter: “We have found Dumba on a rubbish tip in the Gard. Exploited, kept in a lorry, her life is emblematic of every circus animal’s … this suffering must stop!” The organisation filed a complaint to the public prosecutor in the nearby town of Alès, citing animal mistreatment. Having ordered a veterinary inspection, the prosecutor declared himself satisfied that the elephant was well cared for, but he didn’t publish the vet’s report – and despite pressure from One Voice, he still hasn’t. Frustrated by the prosecutor’s failure to act, One Voice commissioned other vets to examine video footage of Dumba. The vets had some concerns about her health: she was too thin, had dry, scurfy skin and was probably suffering from joint pain, they said. The pop star Cher, who co-founded the animal welfare charity Free the Wild, wrote to the French minister Barbara Pompili, who was deliberating on whether to ban wild animals in circuses, asking her to end Dumba’s “daily torment”. Pompili replied, expressing noncommittal sympathy (“a judicial inquiry is under way”). People dug up old photos of the family going about their business, and posted their protests on social media: “This is #Dumba being hosed down in a parking lot. Seriously? Concrete for an elephant you have already crippled? Just another example of how Dumba is being abused by the Kludskys and their pathetic staff, we need to get her away from them now.” Once the family’s location had been made public, a steady stream of journalists and the simply curious tramped out to Dumba’s camp, just beyond the village proper, and the Kludskys greeted them politely. When I turned up in early February, Kruse was cordial, if a little wary. It was a cool, sunny afternoon. Emerging from the transporter’s cab wearing jeans and a warm jacket, she led me inside the tent and up to the electric wire that marked off the elephant’s 10 x 8 metre pen. Instinctively, as Dumba’s trainer, she placed herself between the animal and her audience. Female Asian elephants have a reputation for moodiness, but everyone I have spoken to who has met Dumba has described her as calm and docile. She is nearly 3 metres tall. I gazed up into her amber eyes, and she flapped her ears and waved her trunk, which like her ears is speckled pink, in what seemed like a joyful welcome. George – diminutive, muscular, all smiles – climbed down from the trailer to say hello. Czech by origin, he let his wife do the talking, and by then her talk was resentful. When Dumba lifted one foot, as if offering to shake hands, Yvonne clicked her tongue. “They’ll tell you she does that because it relieves her joint pain,” she said, referring to the animal rights activists. “But we taught her that trick years ago.” She blamed One Voice for putting her family’s health at risk by undermining their attempts to shield from Covid. It’s hard for a non-expert to know if an elephant is healthy or happy, but mayor Ozil – no expert himself, he’s quick to admit – was present during the official vet’s inspection that took place while Dumba was in Euzet. “If the vet had confirmed the association’s charges, I would have been the first to ensure that she was removed from her jailers,” he said. “That wasn’t the case.” By then, his office was receiving hate mail. “Please let Mayor Cyril Ozil know how you feel about his complacency with Dumba’s suffering and his support towards Dumba’s abusers,” one animal rights campaigner tweeted on 26 January. The residents of Euzet did not appreciate this, or the false media reports that Dumba was living in a landfill and that the Kludskys had fled a lawsuit for animal mistreatment in Spain. “Everyone in Euzet who saw the elephant was shocked by what they read in the press,” Ozil said. Many locals felt that the harried family should be left in peace. While One Voice’s complaint was being investigated, the Kludskys had to stay in Euzet, but on 20 February, shortly after the complaint was dismissed, they vanished again – leaving just a square of yellowed grass where Dumba’s tent had been. A day or two later, Ozil received a text message saying that they had arrived safely at their new destination: “Dumba ate almost the whole way as usual … Thank you for everything. Yvonne, George and Martyn.” Even if Ozil knew where they’d gone, he told me, he wouldn’t say. * * * As something close to circus royalty, Yvonne Kruse represents a proud tradition brought low in the court of public opinion. In 2021, she is a pariah, but 70 years ago, her parents were the height of glamour. Kruse’s Swedish-born father, Gösta Kruse, trained elephants for the Bertram Mills Circus, the UK’s biggest postwar circus, in its big-top heyday of the 50s and 60s. The high point of his career, he wrote in his memoir Trunk Call, came in 1952, when a young Queen Elizabeth II watched his elephants perform at London’s Olympia. Kruse’s mother, Liverpudlian Joan Fowles, also worked for the same circus – her speciality was riding cantering horses standing up, each foot on the back of a different horse – and on the day the couple married in Southport, then part of Lancashire, in 1955, they rode past admiring crowds on an elephant named Jennie. A year later, their daughter Yvonne was born. An elephant pushed her pram, and she was photographed aged two with three of them stacked above her. But around the time the Bertram Mills Circus was drawing its biggest crowds, a quiet revolution was beginning in the science of animal cognition. Studies were leading to the recognition that some animal species were capable of complex mental operations and feelings. They were not as different from humans as had once been thought. Over the next few decades, observers of elephant behaviour discovered that elephants can identify each other at up to 2km distance, by picking up very low-frequency sounds. They reported that an adult female knows the voices of up to 100 others, and remembers them for years. A daughter stays with her mother until her death, which she grieves – guarding the body in silence, for example, or covering it with leaves. Elephants are empathic and loyal, intelligent and sociable. They’re also self-aware, being among the few big-brained animals that can recognise themselves in a mirror. And though elephants have been tamed, they have never been domesticated in the sense of being selectively bred, like dogs or horses. “Tamed” is a relative term, too: “They can’t habituate to small spaces,” says the elephant researcher Joyce Poole. These revelations jarred with people’s knowledge of how circus animals were kept, and the cruel way in which they were often taken from their mothers in infancy and kept in isolation. In the UK, which led the way in changing public perceptions, there were orchestrated campaigns against animal acts in circuses from the early 80s. Circus supremo Gerry Cottle, whose first job was “shovelling up elephant shit”, sold his last elephant in 1993 and eventually supported a ban, on the grounds that animal acts were now giving circus a bad name. That ban, the Wild Animals in Circuses Act 2019, came into effect last year. Dozens of European countries have now prohibited wild animals in circuses. Germany and Spain are notable exceptions, with local but not nationwide bans, while France announced last year that it would phase out animals in travelling circuses. The problem is what to do with the animals that remain. According to the European Elephant Group (EEG), based in Germany, there are just shy of 100 circus elephants left in Europe. Elephants can live to 70, though their life expectancy tends to be significantly shorter in captivity. Most that remain in Europe are middle-aged or older. These are the animals that concern Muriel Arnal, the president of One Voice. She is now in her 50s, and lives in Brittany. Her passion for rescuing began when she was on holiday at the French seaside aged about 10, and saw an elephant in a parked circus lorry. The presence of a large, exotic animal in a cage shocked her. “Every day I filled my backpack with bread and walked 2 or 3km to give it to him,” she told me. Though she studied business administration at university, when it came to choosing a career she decided to follow her idol, Dian Fossey, and devote her life to animals. Arnal set up One Voice in 1995, and scored a notable victory five years later when she had a chimpanzee called Achille removed from a circus and sent to an ape sanctuary. After that, she turned her attention to lions, tigers and elephants. Today, One Voice has about 17,000 supporters, whom she refers to as “non-violent warriors”, and she campaigns tirelessly against animal cruelty in any form – hunting, fur, experimentation, circuses. She wants France to ban animal performing of all kinds, not just travelling circuses. There is something quasi-religious about the way Arnal discusses her calling; she talks a lot, patiently and calmly, about the “martyrdom” of animals, and their “despair”. While Arnal considers people who make their living from performing animals unfit to look after them, William Kerwich, president of the French union representing animal trainers, insists no one is better qualified to care for an animal than the trainer who has known it all its life. He is deeply suspicious of the do-gooders who set up animal retirement homes paid for by donations from a public who, he suggests, have been duped into thinking that all circus folk are animal torturers. “If there were to be a ban – and we’re not there yet – it is out of the question that our animals should go to a sanctuary where there is no one competent to look after them,” he said. The union, Kerwich told me, was standing squarely behind Yvonne Kruse. What ageing elephants need, says Scott Blais, is space, autonomy and the company of other elephants. Blais, who set up a sanctuary in Tennessee in 1995 and another in Brazil in 2016, keeps elephants in a setting as close as possible to conditions in the wild, and says previous owners who have returned to visit their old elephants often marvel at their transformation. It was at the Tennessee sanctuary that workers witnessed the extraordinary reunion of two former circus elephants, Shirley and Jenny, in 1999. The two had spent one season together at a circus when Jenny was a calf. After a separation of more than 20 years, they recognised each other and bent the steel bars of an elephant fence in their eagerness to get close to each other. They became inseparable, and for seven years, until Jenny died in 2006, their relationship was like that of mother and daughter. Elephants have shown they can retain a bond with humans, too. Joyce Poole recalled her reunion with a wild African elephant after 12 years. When she called out to him, he recognised her voice, walked up to her car window, and “allowed her to touch him”, she said. Elephants also kill humans, in captivity and in their ever-shrinking natural habitat, but these numbers are tiny compared to the numbers of elephants killed by humans each year. * * * ‘Where is Dumba now?” pleaded a One Voice supporter on Twitter on 21 March. “Is there any way to know if she is safe?” It was a month since the Kludskys had left Euzet. It wasn’t just animal rights activists who wanted to know where the Kludskys and Dumba had gone. So, too, did the couple behind a new elephant sanctuary in south-west France. In 2011, seeing that bans on wild animals in circuses were looming across Europe and realising that rescued animals would need somewhere to go, two Belgian elephant keepers at Antwerp zoo decided to set up the continent’s first elephant sanctuary. Supported by donations, including from animal protection organisations such as One Voice and the Brigitte Bardot Foundation, Sofie Goetghebeur and her partner, Tony Verhulst, bought 28 hectares of rolling woodland in France’s Périgord-Limousin regional natural park, and created Elephant Haven. The first phase of the sanctuary’s construction was completed in July 2020, and when I visited recently, Goetghebeur and Verhulst gave me a tour. The design of Elephant Haven is based on what science tells us about how best to manage elephants in captivity. There is a large wooden barn big enough to accommodate three elephants, complete with an elephant fence, a thick carpet of sand and a dispensary for medical attention. Seven hectares of the property have been fenced off for elephants to roam in, and video surveillance has been installed. There is an orchard to supply the elephants with fruit, and an underground spring, which is important as elephants can drink more than 100 litres a day, and like to bathe. There are mud pools for wallowing, and log walls for back-scratching. There is just one problem: there are no elephants. Ten years after their dream was conceived, Goetghebeur and Verhulst have no rescues to show for it. They knew that the first elephant would be the hardest. An elephant’s human “family” was bound to be reluctant to part with it if the sanctuary had no elephant company to offer. But isolated in their rural idyll, Goetghebeur and Verhulst, who are not yet 50, seemed tired and demoralised. Their sponsors, they admitted, were getting impatient. “Everyone wants to know when the elephants will come,” Goetghebeur sighed. For years, she and Verhulst tried to make contact with the Freiwald circus family in the Netherlands, owners of that country’s most famous elephant, Buba, but they never got a reply. The Dutch banned wild animals from circuses in 2015, but an exception was made for Buba because at the time there was no obvious home for her. Last December, after a political tussle involving the Dutch agriculture minister, it was decided that Buba should remain with the Freiwalds. The pair had no more luck with Longleat safari park in the UK, which they hoped to persuade to part with its only elephant, Anne, who is in her 60s or possibly even older. In 2011, Anne was removed from a site near Peterborough belonging to a circus, after an organisation called Animal Defenders International secretly filmed her being beaten by a handler. Longleat took her in, and 10 years later she is still there, pampered but with no company apart from three Nubian goats. Anne’s rescue had been organised by vet Jonathan Cracknell, who told me her previous owner continued to worry about her welfare long after he had been convicted of maltreating her. “If the weather forecast said rain, he’d ring up and give my team advice,” he said. (The judge acknowledged that the owner loved animals and that he had not been aware of the abuse.) Cracknell left Longleat in 2016, since when a small grassroots group called Action for Elephants UK has been lobbying Longleat to release Anne to the French sanctuary, but so far the safari park has resisted all such calls. In a statement, Longleat warned of the high risks involved in “uprooting her from familiar surroundings and people she has learned to trust, and transporting her to a new, unknown location with the prospect of being left in the company of other elephants she does not know”. Anne often sways – a form of repetitive behaviour indicating psychological disturbance, thought to stem from past bullying by humans and other elephants. Joyce Poole, who has studied elephants in the wild for more than 40 years, told me there was no reason Anne couldn’t still form an attachment to another elephant, as long as the introductions were handled properly. But there is also her advanced age to consider: if she were to die en route to France, Longleat would probably get the blame. It’s genuinely difficult to know what’s best for Anne now, said Cracknell. When I visited Goetghebeur and Verhulst in March, they were still hoping to bring Anne and Dumba to Elephant Haven. But their approaches to Kruse – through Facebook, and a letter delivered via an intermediary – were met with silence. Goetghebeur and Verhulst realised they were up against a “gentleman’s agreement” within the circus community not to send them an animal. As far as Kruse was concerned, Elephant Haven was backed by people who had tried to “kidnap” Dumba. As I was leaving the sanctuary, Verhulst shared a last thought: “The worst thing is they argue they are really attached to her, but she is for sale. You can buy Dumba if you want.” Photographs and emails have circulated online suggesting that Dumba was for sale as recently as September 2020, for €180,000. When I asked Kruse about this, she denied it. “We were offered €200,000 some years ago but declined. That is not our way.” Whatever the truth, Kruse’s claim that she loves Dumba like a daughter is certainly complicated by the fact that the elephant is the family’s main source of income. “Yes the animals are dear in the dollar sense, but that’s all,” said Arnal. “The trainers who mistreat them and keep them in abject conditions – as in Dumba’s case – have no affection for them.” Kruse said in an email to me that Covid had been a financial disaster for the family. They had had no government support and were living off savings and the generosity of family and friends. “I find it ironic,” she said, “that the associations which are supposedly trying to help and save the animals never once got in contact with us to offer a bale of hay or sack of carrots.” * * * Over the first weekend in April, news broke that Dumba had resurfaced in Germany. After the Kludskys left Euzet, Muriel Arnal told me, One Voice had dispatched investigators to tail their vehicle. “We had lost Dumba once, it was out of the question that we should lose her again,” she said. On 2 April, they announced the elephant’s new whereabouts: the Kludskys had left Dumba in a wildlife park between Berlin and Hamburg. The photo the organisation released seemed to show Dumba in a bare prison cell – though the bars containing her were those of an elephant fence, the likes of which the Spanish authorities had demanded the Kludskys install in Caldes. Dumba’s new home, the Elefantenhof Platschow, is run by Sonni Frankello, scion of a German circus dynasty. Comprising an old farm with stables, barns and green space, it hosts a range of animals including a dozen elephants, which occupy three of its seven hectares. The public pays to see, feed and ride the elephants, and though the animals don’t tour, they do perform and they can be hired out for events. The Kludskys stayed with Frankello’s family for 10 days in late February – “to see that the transition went smoothly”, Kruse said – then returned home to Spain to allow Dumba to complete her integration. By the time they left, Kruse and Frankello said Dumba had started bonding with another elephant called Susi who arrived at around the same time, from a Spanish circus. The two were introduced via a shared paddock where a cable separated them initially, until it was considered safe to remove it. By early April, Dumba and Susi were mixing freely, and being introduced slowly to some of the other elephants. Neither Kruse nor Frankello would say if Frankello had paid for Dumba, but Kruse told me the move was permanent – that they had done what they thought was best for Dumba, in the circumstances – and that her family were desperately missing their daughter: “The first cut of hay in the fields, not having to buy all those apples and carrots when I go shopping, not being able to sit by her when reading or my husband not going for a last muck out, more hay for the night and a cuddle around midnight remind us constantly of our loss.” One Voice is keeping up its campaign for Kruse to be prosecuted for mistreatment. They are still trying to persuade the Alès prosecutor to publish the report of the vet who inspected Dumba in Euzet, so that they can use it to support the lawsuit. While Dumba continues to suffer, Arnal told me, they won’t give up. On the Kludskys’ side, Kerwich, the animal trainers’ representative in France, used the same words – “On ne lachera pas” – we won’t give up. When he felt she was ready, Frankello planned to resume teaching Dumba to perform tricks, adapting to her age and aptitudes. “I know she is good at football,” he said. “She is also very good with her trunk, so perhaps I’ll teach her to do jigsaw puzzles.” Like many circus people, Frankello sees training as the highest form of enrichment, and believes that circus elephants get mental stimulation from performance and enjoy attention and applause. Covid rules were strict this spring, in the German state where the Elefantenhof is situated, and he had weeks to hone her drop-kick before the first vaccinated visitors arrived in May, to watch and laugh and clap. • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, listen to our podcasts here and sign up to the long read weekly email here.","charCount":"29246","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/lauraspinney\">Laura Spinney</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2021/jun/08/vaccinating-britain-children-adults-overseas","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-08T05:00:12Z","webTitle":"Before Britain vaccinates children, should it vaccinate the world? | Gaby Hinsliff","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/08/vaccinating-britain-children-adults-overseas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/08/vaccinating-britain-children-adults-overseas","fields":{"headline":"Before Britain vaccinates children, should it vaccinate the world?","standfirst":"<p>There’s a debate about giving UK teenagers the Covid jab.

But increasingly the toughest choices involve relationships with, and obligations to, the outside world.</p> <p>By prioritising the vaccination of 12-year-olds who are at a vanishingly small risk of serious illness this August over making more shots available immediately to countries in dire need, Britain and other western countries would be visibly choosing <em>not</em> to save lives overseas. Perhaps many would find that choice depressingly easy to live with, despite a recent <a href=\"https://www.savethechildren.org.uk/news/media-centre/press-releases/uk-backs-sharing-covid-vaccines\">Save the Children poll</a> showing 67% of the British public supported sharing vaccines in theory; after all, the few million doses British teenagers might use this summer would be even more of a drop in the ocean than the 100m <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/covid-vaccines-boris-johnson-pledges-to-jab-the-world-by-end-of-next-year-jgms6xkz7\">Boris Johnson is expected to offer</a> the world by the end of this year, which is in itself only a fraction of what’s ultimately needed.</p> <p>But by concentrating too many of our efforts at home, we could paradoxically be jeopardising lives here too. At best we’d be taking a punt on an under-vaccinated world beyond our borders, into which westerners are desperate to plunge – for holidays but also work, family reunions and all the countless reasons people cross borders – and from which someone may well return harbouring an explosive new variant.</p> <p>The odds are obviously higher for some children than others. Those who are shielding or clinically vulnerable should get the jab if it’s safe for them, for example. There’s a strong case for vaccinating 17- and 18-year-olds, both because older teenagers seem to react to the virus much like young adults do, and to help keep them at school in the run-up to A-levels. In a localised crisis such as Blackburn’s, vaccinating children should surely be an option. And once this becomes a routine annual jab, not a race against time in a pandemic, the argument changes again.</p> <p>But as a parent, I can’t shake the feeling that prioritising the universal vaccination of children now in areas with barely a handful of cases, while a storm that knows no borders builds overseas, looks both morally unjust and practically shortsighted. If the JCVI concludes that vaccinating children this August is genuinely essential, then at the very least we should balance that with a far more generous and speedy offer to the rest of the world than is currently on the table. History won’t forgive us for calling this one wrongly.</p> <ul> <li><p>Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul>","newspaperPageNumber":"1","wordcount":"1113","firstPublicationDate":"2021-06-08T05:00:12Z","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2021-06-08T05:00:12Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2021-06-08T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"The Guardian","shortUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/p/hydbc","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/6d9d60ccda0b68d93bec54e48dfd726354872f2c/0_176_4928_2959/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","isLive":"true","bodyText":"They started queuing along the beach road first thing in the morning, and before long the line of young people stretched out of sight.

By prioritising the vaccination of 12-year-olds who are at a vanishingly small risk of serious illness this August over making more shots available immediately to countries in dire need, Britain and other western countries would be visibly choosing not to save lives overseas. Perhaps many would find that choice depressingly easy to live with, despite a recent Save the Children poll showing 67% of the British public supported sharing vaccines in theory; after all, the few million doses British teenagers might use this summer would be even more of a drop in the ocean than the 100m Boris Johnson is expected to offer the world by the end of this year, which is in itself only a fraction of what’s ultimately needed. But by concentrating too many of our efforts at home, we could paradoxically be jeopardising lives here too. At best we’d be taking a punt on an under-vaccinated world beyond our borders, into which westerners are desperate to plunge – for holidays but also work, family reunions and all the countless reasons people cross borders – and from which someone may well return harbouring an explosive new variant. The odds are obviously higher for some children than others. Those who are shielding or clinically vulnerable should get the jab if it’s safe for them, for example. There’s a strong case for vaccinating 17- and 18-year-olds, both because older teenagers seem to react to the virus much like young adults do, and to help keep them at school in the run-up to A-levels. In a localised crisis such as Blackburn’s, vaccinating children should surely be an option. And once this becomes a routine annual jab, not a race against time in a pandemic, the argument changes again. But as a parent, I can’t shake the feeling that prioritising the universal vaccination of children now in areas with barely a handful of cases, while a storm that knows no borders builds overseas, looks both morally unjust and practically shortsighted. If the JCVI concludes that vaccinating children this August is genuinely essential, then at the very least we should balance that with a far more generous and speedy offer to the rest of the world than is currently on the table. History won’t forgive us for calling this one wrongly.

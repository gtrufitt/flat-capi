From AP: </p> <p>Thailand has been fighting to deal with a virus surge that began in early April in a group of nightclubs in Bangkok and has since spread around the country.</p> <p>The Center for Covid-19 Situation Administration reported a record 5,485 new cases, of which 1,953 were in prisons. Confirmed deaths increased by 19 to bring the total to 1,031 since the pandemic began last year.<br></p> <p>The total number of confirmed cases has now risen to 159,792, of which 82% occurred during the latest surge. Many of the cases are concentrated in prisons, housing for construction workers, factories, slums and low-income housing areas.</p> <p> Officials have in some cases been criticised for allowing companies to isolate and quarantine workers inside factories.</p> <p>Bangkok, which has been a hot spot in the outbreak, reported 1,356 of the cases on Monday. CCSA deputy spokeswoman Apisamai Srirangsan said the capital has 45 clusters to deal with.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Bangkok will slightly ease its lockdown measures starting tomorrow. In addition to reopening parks and botanical gardens, the city will allow limited numbers of visitors to museums, science parks, historical monuments, ancient places and art centres.<br></p> <p>Schools, bars, nightclubs and entertainment venues will remain closed, but tattoo parlours, nail salons, beauty and weight loss clinics, and some massage parlours will be allowed to reopen with restrictions on the number of clients.</p> <p>Thailand had been considered a success story last year for largely containing the virus, though at great economic cost, especially to its tourism sector, because foreign visitors were largely banned from entering the country.</p> <p>So far, about 3.3% of the country’s roughly 69 million people have received at least one vaccine dose. The government has secured only 7 million vaccine doses in total.</p> <p>The government has been negotiating to get more supplies that would allow it to fully inoculate about 70% of the population by the end of the year. Its earlier plans would have allowed only about 45% of the population to be inoculated.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eb7728125c2725aa96cba33c2720fd798293682a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb7728125c2725aa96cba33c2720fd798293682a/0_182_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shopping mall staff wait to receive the Sinovac Covid-19 vaccine at a vaccination centre inside a shopping mall in Bangkok, Thailand, today.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shopping mall staff wait to receive the Sinovac Covid-19 vaccine at a vaccination centre inside a shopping mall in Bangkok, Thailand, today.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Diego Azubel/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-05-31T09:33:58.688Z\">at 10.33am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-60b4a0d88f08d486a77183ac\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-05-31T08:45:07.016Z\">9.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Hong Kong</strong> will offer civil servants who get vaccinated against Covid-19 a day off for each dose, the government said today, as authorities struggle to boost a sluggish innoculation rate among the city’s 7.5 million population. From Reuters:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The secretary for the civil service, Patrick Nip, speaking at a press conference, also said the government was in talks with financial institutions, tertiary schools and theme parks to set up innoculation centres for staff to ramp up the vaccination rate.</p> <p>Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said at the briefing she had already sent letters to more than 100 firms urging them to follow in the footsteps of the government’s measures.</p> <p>“From now until the end of August is a crucial time for pandemic prevention,” Lam said. “We’re kicking off the ‘Early Vaccination for All’ campaign today to boost the vaccination rate, in order to achieve herd immunity.”</p> <p>Health secretary Sophia Chan joined her colleagues’ calls for people to get vaccinated, warning that if another wave of coronavirus sweeps the territory those who have not been innoculated could face more restrictions.</p> <p>More than 2.3 million coronavirus vaccines have been administered in Hong Kong, with the lacklustre rate resulting in a surplus of doses that are due to expire as soon as August.</p> <p>Roughly 21% of the population aged 16 and above has had at least one dose, Lam said. The latest move comes as some businesses have already announced steps to lure a hesitant public, with Sino Group, Ng Teng Fong Charitable Foundation and Chinese Estates Holdings dangling a new flat worth HK$10.8m (£1m) as the top prize in a vaccine lottery.</p> <p>The government has also relaxed some coronavirus rules for vaccinated people in a bid to encourage inoculations as worries over adverse reactions and a lack of confidence in the Chinese-made Sinovac vaccine hamper the vaccination rate.</p> <p>Hong Kong offers both Sinovac and Germany’s BioNTech vaccines and residents can choose.</p> <p>The global financial hub has kept Covid-19 transmission largely under control, recording more than 11,800 cases and 210 deaths, much lower than many other developed cities.</p> <p>While life in Hong Kong has largely returned to normal with schools reopened and restaurants and shopping malls full, the government still limits gatherings outside to no more than four people.</p> <p><a

down further.”</p> <p>Dr Wall said there are very young populations in many of the areas that have seen the highest rises in Bolton, and each time the age comes down for vaccine eligibility, thousands more people are able to come forward for the jab.</p> <p>“I think the age of eligibility going down every few days has really helped, and will really help us, if we can get those people through the

disease under control.</p> <p>People leaving Guangdong by plane, train, bus or private car after 10pm today must present results of a nucleic acid test within the past 72 hours, the provincial government announced. It said testing stations for truck drivers would be set up on major roads.</p> <p>The government of the provincial capital, Guangzhou, a business centre of 15 million people, ordered mass testing after locally acquired infections were found beginning 21 May. The government said 700,000 people had been tested through last Wednesday.</p> <p>China had relaxed most restrictions on domestic travel after the ruling Communist Party declared the virus under control last March. Travellers arriving from abroad still must be tested.</p> <p>On Saturday, residents of one Guangzhou neighbourhood were ordered to stay at home for door-to-door testing. In some areas, outdoor markets and child care facilities were closed and in-person grade school classes and indoor restaurant dining cancelled.</p> <p>China reports a handful of new cases every day but says almost all are believed to be people who were infected abroad.

Travel to France from the UK will only be permitted for EU nationals, French residents, or those travelling for essential reasons. Those who are allowed to make the journey must take a pre-departure Covid test and quarantine for seven days on arrival. France is listed as an “amber” destination by the UK government, which advises against travel there, with British authorities requiring people to self-isolate for 10 days and take two Covid tests on return. Last Wednesday, the French government’s official spokesman, Gabriel Attal, said there was “a new situation with the progression of the so-called Indian variant in the UK”, adding that Germany had already imposed strict controls on visitors from Britain and that France was taking “similar measures”. France has today opened up Covid-19 vaccines to all adults, a week before Germany, as Europe races to avoid another wave of infections caused by new virus variants, AFP reports. Until now, French authorities gave priority to people over 50, people in “priority professions” or younger adults with underlying health problems. So far, 25.4 million people have received a first shot of a vaccine, representing about 38% of the population and nearly one in two adults. Nearly 12 million have received the two shots required for full protection. As the French savour a degree of freedom following the reopening of cafes, restaurants and museums two weeks ago, initially high levels of vaccine scepticism have begun to subside. A Cevipof poll conducted in early May showed that 65% of adults planned to get vaccinated, up from 48% in February. “I am fully convinced that we are going to see a lot of people getting vaccinated,” Prof Alain Fischer, the immunologist who heads the government’s vaccination advisory board, said today, adding that immunisation was the key to “getting back an increasingly normal life.” With 28 million adults eligible for a first shot, but only around half a million appointments available each day, many people have opted to travel outside their neighbourhood or even their region to secure highly coveted Pfizer or Moderna shots. Vaccinations with the AstraZeneca and Janssen jabs are only open to those aged 55, after cases of potentially deadly blood clots in a very small number of younger people vaccinated. The government is hoping that the 76.7 million vaccines which it is expecting to receive in June will help it meet demand. So far the virus has claimed 109,431 lives in France. Russia’s single-dose Sputnik Light vaccine against Covid-19 has been approved for use in the Palestinian territories, Russia’s RDIF sovereign wealth fund has said. The RDIF fund is marketing the Russian vaccine abroad, Reuters reports. Portugal’s economy shrank 3.3% in the first quarter from the preceding three months, as tourism withered due to a tight lockdown imposed in mid-January, official data indicates. To fight a surge in Covid infections in mid-January, which at the time was the deadliest outbreak per capita in the world, Portugal imposed a strict three-month lockdown, which has since been gradually lifted. Statistics agency INE said, in its second reading, that gross domestic product shrank 5.4% from the first quarter last year when the country’s first lockdown did not take effect until mid-March. As Reuters reports, Portugal’s economy, in which the tourism sector represented around 15% of GDP before the pandemic hit, shrank 7.6% in 2020, its biggest annual slump since 1936. The European Commission has proposed that all EU countries gradually ease travel measures over the summer, as the number of Covid vaccinations continues to grow and the severity of the pandemic in the bloc diminishes, Reuters reports. The EU executive, which is seeking to harmonise travel measures across the bloc, said that - according to its recommendation - fully vaccinated people should be exempt from testing or quarantines when travelling from one EU country to another. Reuters reports: India’s Serum Institute will increase production of AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccines by nearly 40% in June, officials said on Monday, in the first step towards alleviating a shortage that has worsened the country’s battle with coronavirus. The world’s second most-populous nation has struggled with a catastrophic outbreak of Covid-19 since last month which is only now starting to abate after killing tens of thousands of people. Government officials and experts say the only way India can avoid a third wave of infections is by having most of its 1.3 billion population inoculated. The Serum Institute of India, the world’s biggest manufacturer of vaccines, will make 90 million doses of AstraZeneca in June from about 65 million a month now, a company spokesman told Reuters. Most of the shots administered in India are AstraZeneca, but local firm Bharat Biotech also plans to ramp up production of its Covaxin vaccine to 23 million in June from about 10 million in April, a government official said. Covid curbs may not be eased further next week in parts of Scotland where infections are rising, the health secretary has warned. Areas in level two are scheduled to move down to level one on 7 June. However, according to Humza Yousaf, this may not be possible for areas where coronavirus cases are giving “cause for concern”. He said this could impact locations outside Glasgow, which is the only part of Scotland that remains in level three. Speaking to the BBC’s Good Morning Scotland programme, Yousaf said: It may not be the entire country moving to level one. I think people would understand where there are rising case numbers, where there is rising test positivity... it may be the case that parts of the country move to level one but actually other parts of the country we decide to keep in level two. Asked if he was referring to Glasgow, he replied: “Glasgow - but also, I must be quite frank, there are other parts from the data that continue to give us cause for concern.” This has been shared by Edouard Mathieu, head of data at Our World in Data: The 21 June target for scrapping England’s remaining coronavirus restrictions appears increasingly under threat, as a senior government adviser said the country was in the early stages of a third wave. Prof Ravi Gupta, a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme there had been “exponential growth” in new cases, with the variant first detected in India accounting for three-quarters. Asked if the third wave had begun, Gupta replied: “Yes.” He added: Of course, the numbers of cases are relatively low at the moment – all waves start with low numbers of cases that grumble in the background and then become explosive – so the key here is that what we are seeing here is the signs of an early wave. It will probably take longer than earlier waves to emerge because of the fact that we do have quite high levels of vaccination in the population, so there may be a false sense of security for some time, and that’s our concern.

As always, feel free to get in touch on Twitter if you have any story tips. Thailand today reported a record number of new coronavirus cases as the governor of Bangkok announced an easing of some restrictions in effect for more than a month – including people visiting parks for exercise. From AP: Thailand has been fighting to deal with a virus surge that began in early April in a group of nightclubs in Bangkok and has since spread around the country. The Center for Covid-19 Situation Administration reported a record 5,485 new cases, of which 1,953 were in prisons. Confirmed deaths increased by 19 to bring the total to 1,031 since the pandemic began last year. The total number of confirmed cases has now risen to 159,792, of which 82% occurred during the latest surge. Many of the cases are concentrated in prisons, housing for construction workers, factories, slums and low-income housing areas. Officials have in some cases been criticised for allowing companies to isolate and quarantine workers inside factories. Bangkok, which has been a hot spot in the outbreak, reported 1,356 of the cases on Monday. CCSA deputy spokeswoman Apisamai Srirangsan said the capital has 45 clusters to deal with. Bangkok will slightly ease its lockdown measures starting tomorrow. In addition to reopening parks and botanical gardens, the city will allow limited numbers of visitors to museums, science parks, historical monuments, ancient places and art centres. Schools, bars, nightclubs and entertainment venues will remain closed, but tattoo parlours, nail salons, beauty and weight loss clinics, and some massage parlours will be allowed to reopen with restrictions on the number of clients. Thailand had been considered a success story last year for largely containing the virus, though at great economic cost, especially to its tourism sector, because foreign visitors were largely banned from entering the country. So far, about 3.3% of the country’s roughly 69 million people have received at least one vaccine dose. The government has secured only 7 million vaccine doses in total. The government has been negotiating to get more supplies that would allow it to fully inoculate about 70% of the population by the end of the year. Its earlier plans would have allowed only about 45% of the population to be inoculated. Hong Kong will offer civil servants who get vaccinated against Covid-19 a day off for each dose, the government said today, as authorities struggle to boost a sluggish innoculation rate among the city’s 7.5 million population. From Reuters: The secretary for the civil service, Patrick Nip, speaking at a press conference, also said the government was in talks with financial institutions, tertiary schools and theme parks to set up innoculation centres for staff to ramp up the vaccination rate. Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said at the briefing she had already sent letters to more than 100 firms urging them to follow in the footsteps of the government’s measures. “From now until the end of August is a crucial time for pandemic prevention,” Lam said. “We’re kicking off the ‘Early Vaccination for All’ campaign today to boost the vaccination rate, in order to achieve herd immunity.” Health secretary Sophia Chan joined her colleagues’ calls for people to get vaccinated, warning that if another wave of coronavirus sweeps the territory those who have not been innoculated could face more restrictions. More than 2.3 million coronavirus vaccines have been administered in Hong Kong, with the lacklustre rate resulting in a surplus of doses that are due to expire as soon as August. Roughly 21% of the population aged 16 and above has had at least one dose, Lam said. The latest move comes as some businesses have already announced steps to lure a hesitant public, with Sino Group, Ng Teng Fong Charitable Foundation and Chinese Estates Holdings dangling a new flat worth HK$10.8m (£1m) as the top prize in a vaccine lottery. The government has also relaxed some coronavirus rules for vaccinated people in a bid to encourage inoculations as worries over adverse reactions and a lack of confidence in the Chinese-made Sinovac vaccine hamper the vaccination rate. Hong Kong offers both Sinovac and Germany’s BioNTech vaccines and residents can choose. The global financial hub has kept Covid-19 transmission largely under control, recording more than 11,800 cases and 210 deaths, much lower than many other developed cities. While life in Hong Kong has largely returned to normal with schools reopened and restaurants and shopping malls full, the government still limits gatherings outside to no more than four people. Critics of the rules say they are aimed at preventing a repeat of anti-government street protests that rocked the former British colony in 2019. The rise in Covid-19 cases in Bolton, north-west England, where cases had soared giving it the highest infection rate in the country, is slowing down but there is no room for complacency, a senior doctor has warned (via PA Media). The seven-day rate in Bolton currently stands at 386.7 cases per 100,000, down from 452.8 on 21 May, suggesting the recent surge in cases in the town, driven by the spread of the Indian variant of coronavirus, may have peaked. Bolton shares a border with Blackburn with Darwen, and both areas have reported some of the highest numbers of cases of the Indian variant, with Bolton recording 1,354 up to 25 May -– the highest in the country – and Blackburn with Darwen recording 361. Health teams in both local authorities have been running surge testing for the virus, along with “surge vaccinations” to boost take-up among everyone who is eligible for the vaccine. Dr Helen Wall, senior responsible officer for the Covid vaccine programme in Bolton, told BBC Breakfast: “I’m pleased to report that things are starting to slow in terms of the rise here in Covid cases, but we really can’t rest on that. “It’s only been a few days of the rates slowing down so we really are keen to keep pushing forwards and get the rates down further.” Dr Wall said there are very young populations in many of the areas that have seen the highest rises in Bolton, and each time the age comes down for vaccine eligibility, thousands more people are able to come forward for the jab. “I think the age of eligibility going down every few days has really helped, and will really help us, if we can get those people through the doors to be vaccinated asap,” she said. China today reimposed anti-coronavirus travel controls on its southern province of Guangdong, announcing anyone leaving the populous region must be tested for the virus following a spike in infections that has alarmed authorities, the Associated Press reports. Guangdong, which borders Hong Kong, recorded 20 new confirmed cases, all contracted locally, in the 24 hours through to midnight yesterday. Guangdong’s numbers are low compared with many places in the world, but the rise has rattled Chinese leaders who thought they had the disease under control. People leaving Guangdong by plane, train, bus or private car after 10pm today must present results of a nucleic acid test within the past 72 hours, the provincial government announced. It said testing stations for truck drivers would be set up on major roads. The government of the provincial capital, Guangzhou, a business centre of 15 million people, ordered mass testing after locally acquired infections were found beginning 21 May. The government said 700,000 people had been tested through last Wednesday. China had relaxed most restrictions on domestic travel after the ruling Communist Party declared the virus under control last March. Travellers arriving from abroad still must be tested. On Saturday, residents of one Guangzhou neighbourhood were ordered to stay at home for door-to-door testing. In some areas, outdoor markets and child care facilities were closed and in-person grade school classes and indoor restaurant dining cancelled. China reports a handful of new cases every day but says almost all are believed to be people who were infected abroad. The mainland’s official death toll stands at 4,636 out of 91,099 confirmed cases. Hello, this is Haroon Siddique. I’ll be updating the blog for the next few hours. Burkina Faso, one of several countries in Africa that has yet to launch a Covid-19 vaccination campaign, received its first shipment under the global vaccine-sharing scheme Covax yesterday, Reuters reports, citing the country’s health ministry. The 115,200 AstraZeneca doses were flown into the airport of the capital Ouagadougou and were welcomed by a local delegation led by health minister Charlemagne Ouedraogo. “In a few weeks other vaccines will probably arrive to supplement what we have,” Ouedraogo said. The vaccination campaign, which will first target health workers, aims to eventually inoculate over 15 million of the west African nation’s 21.5 million citizens, the ministry said. Some 1.5bn Covid-19 vaccine doses have been administered globally, but only about 1% of them in Africa, data from the World Health Organization (WHO) found. Earlier in May, Burkina Faso was one of a few African countries, including Tanzania and Chad, highlighted by the International Rescue Committee as not having administered a single dose while richer countries had ordered excess supply. The Covax facility, backed by the WHO and the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (Gavi), aims to secure 2bn vaccine doses for lower-income countries by the end of 2021. That’s it from me, Helen Livingstone, for today. Here’s a summary of what’s been happening: Dr Anthony Fauci, the top infectious diseases expert in the US, has told the Guardian it is too early to declare victory against Covid-19 as cases fall in the country to the lowest rates since last June. “We don’t want to declare victory prematurely because we still have a ways to go,” he said. Japan is considering requiring negative Covid-19 test results or vaccination records from fans attending the Tokyo Olympics, the Yomiuri newspaper has reported, as a poll showed public opposition to the Games remains strong. The acting premier of the Australian state of Victoria, currently enduring a seven-day lockdown, has warned that the situation remains “incredibly serious” as the region posted 11 new cases of Covid, including some involving aged care homes. “I want to be very clear with everyone, this outbreak may well get worse before it gets better,” James Merlino said. India has reported its lowest daily rise in new coronavirus infections since 11 April at 152,734 cases over the past 24 hours, while deaths rose by 3,128. The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, wants the upcoming Group of Seven summit to reach agreement on Covid-19 vaccine passports and to open talks on a “world treaty” to prepare for future pandemics. “We’ve got to do better than this,” he told Canadian broadcaster CBC. In the UK, ministers will adopt a cautious approach in deciding whether to ease lockdown on 21 June, with hospitals already under pressure and health experts warning against “charging ahead”. A health expert affiliated with the World Health Organization has called on the US to share any intelligence it has about the origins of the coronavirus outbreak with the WHO and the scientific community. Vietnam is planning to test all 9 million people in its largest city for the coronavirus and has imposed more restrictions to deal with a growing Covid-19 outbreak. Vietnam is planning to test all 9 million people in its largest city for the coronavirus and has imposed more restrictions to deal with a growing Covid-19 outbreak, the Associated Press reports. People in Ho Chi Minh city are only allowed to leave home for necessary activities and public gatherings of more than 10 people are banned for the next two weeks, the government has announced. The city, Vietnam’s economic hub, also shut down non-essential business on Thursday when cases started to increase. State newspaper Vietnam News said the city authority is planning to test its entire population with a testing capacity of 100,000 samples a day. The newspaper also said police had filed a case on Sunday against a couple who head a Protestant church mission for “spreading dangerous infectious diseases,” citing poor health protocols applied at the premises. At least 145 cases of coronavirus infection have been reported with links to the Revival Ekklesia Mission, a Protestant sect, and the city district of Go Vap, where the church is based, has been locked down. Vietnam has since banned all religious events nationwide. The newspaper said church followers gathered in small space for singing and chanting without proper distancing and mask wearing. Ho Chi Minh city police said the mission has 48 registered members. Here’s an update on Japan’s potential plan to require fans at the Tokyo Olympics to provide proof of vaccination or a negative Covid test from our correspondent Justin McCurry: China has reported a sudden surge of Covid cases in the country’s south, with 20 new local cases on Sunday, Reuters reports, as authorities lock down areas of Guangdong province’s capital city. Of the 27 new coronavirus cases reported by the national health authority in its daily updates, only seven infections were imported, with the remainder originating in Guangdong province. On Saturday, authorities placed a neighbourhood in the capital city of Guangzhou under lockdown as a precautionary measure to curb the virus’ spread. State media reports have suggested that the the recent outbreak is linked to a strain of the virus originating in India. In a Guardian interview, Dr Anthony Fauci, the top infectious diseases expert in the US, has warned it is too early to declare victory against Covid-19 as cases fall in the country to the lowest rates since last June. “We don’t want to declare victory prematurely because we still have a ways to go,” Fauci said. “But the more and more people that can get vaccinated, as a community, the community will be safer and safer.” Daily coronavirus cases have dropped 53% since 1 May, according to Johns Hopkins University data, but the rates are still high in the unvaccinated population and cases are growing globally. Already there have been more global cases in 2021 than in all of 2020, according to Johns Hopkins University data. “As long as there is some degree of activity throughout the world, there’s always a danger of variants emerging and diminishing somewhat the effectiveness of our vaccines,” said Fauci. The Australian state of Victoria, currently enduring a seven-day lockdown, has reported 11 new cases of Covid-19, bringing the current number of active cases in the area to 54. Worryingly, three of those cases are related to aged care homes, which bore the brunt of last year’s outbreak in Victoria, in which hundreds of elderly care home residents died. Acting state premier James Merlino told reporters on Monday the situation was “incredibly serious” and that “the next few days remain critical.” “I want to be very clear with everyone, this outbreak may well get worse before it gets better,” he said. The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, wants the upcoming Group of Seven summit to reach agreement on Covid-19 vaccine passports and to open talks on a “world treaty” to prepare for future pandemics, Reuters reports. “We need to have agreements on issues such as vaccine passports, Covid status certification and the rest,” Johnson told the Canadian public channel CBC. Johnson was speaking ahead of a 11-13 June summit of the G7 economic powers (US, Canada, Japan, Britain, France, Germany and Italy) which he will host in Cornwall, at the southwestern tip of England. “What we need, I think, is a global treaty on pandemic preparedness,” he said, adding that 2020 had been a “terrible year for humanity.” Johnson said it was also a bad time “for believers in global cooperation, because the world simply became balkanized,” with many countries slow to share stocks of protective equipment, medicines and vaccines. “We’ve got to do better than this,” the prime minister added. “Vaccination has got to be a global enterprise,” Johnson said in the interview taped on Friday and broadcast on Sunday. He said it was crucial that developing countries receive vaccine supplies as quickly as possible. Rather than the goal set by some of vaccinating the world by 2024 or 2025, Johnson set a more ambitious target, saying, “We need to get this done by the end of next year.” India has reported its lowest daily rise in new coronavirus infections since 11 April at 152,734 cases over the past 24 hours, while deaths rose by 3,128, according to Reuters. The South Asian nation’s tally of infections now stands at 28 million, while the death toll has reached 329,100, health ministry data shows. And in a slightly lighter twist on Covid news from India, this great picture from Hyderabad shows a man wearing headgear inspired by the virus and who is employed by a private hospital to counsel local residents about Covid safety measures. Japan is considering requiring negative Covid-19 test results or vaccination records from fans attending the Tokyo Olympics, the Yomiuri newspaper has reported according to Reuters, as a new poll showed public opposition to the Games remains strong. With the opening of the Games less than two months away, public confidence has been shaken by a fourth wave of coronavirus infections and a slow vaccination rollout. Foreign spectators have already been banned and game organisers are expected to make a decision next month on whether Japanese fans will be able to attend and, if so, under what conditions. In addition to other coronavirus measures like banning loud cheering and high-fives, the Yomiuri said the government was considering whether spectators should be required to show a negative test result taken within a week of attending an Olympic event. The report was met with outrage among some social media users, with thousands of tweets criticising the country’s continued push to host the Olympics in the middle of a pandemic. The term “negative test certificate” was trending on Twitter in Japan, garnering over 8,000 tweets on Monday morning. In a poll published by the Nikkei paper on Monday, over 60% of respondents were in favour of cancelling or delaying the Games, a result in line with previous polls by other media outlets. Hello and welcome to today’s coverage of the coronavirus pandemic with me, Helen Livingstone. Japan is considering requiring negative test results or vaccination records from fans attending the Tokyo Olympics, the Yomiuri newspaper has reported, as a new poll showed public opposition to the Games remains strong. The UK’s prime minister, Boris Johnson, has told Canadian broadcaster CBC he wants an upcoming Group of Seven summit to reach agreement on Covid-19 vaccine passports and to open talks on a “world treaty” to prepare for future pandemics. And Victoria has confirmed 11 new locally acquired coronavirus cases, including four relating to aged care homes, bringing the total number of active cases in the Australian state, to 54. You can follow our live coverage on the Victorian lockdown here. Here’s a roundup of what’s been happening over the weekend: In the UK, ministers will adopt a cautious approach in deciding whether to ease lockdown on June 21, with hospitals already under pressure and health experts warning against “charging ahead”. Scientists have warned ministers that a third wave of coronavirus may have already begun in Britain, casting doubt on plans in England to lift all lockdown restrictions in three weeks’ time. A health expert affiliated with the World Health Organization has called on the US to share any intelligence it has about the origins of the coronavirus outbreak with the WHO and the scientific community. Authorities in Vietnam have detected a new coronavirus variant that is a combination of the Covid variants first identified in India and the UK and spreads quickly by air, the health minister has said. Egypt will lift restrictions it imposed earlier this month to curb the spread the coronavirus, including early closure of shops and restaurants, from June 1, the cabinet said. South Africa has extended its nightly curfew and limited the number of people at gatherings to slow the spread of Covid-19 as positive cases surge, President Cyril Ramaphosa said on Sunday. Only 1% of the 1.3 billion vaccines injected around the world have been administered in Africa – and that comparative percentage has been declining in recent weeks. It is a stark figure that underlines just how serious a problem global vaccine inequity has become. But the answer for the developing world is not as simple as delivering more vaccines. Italy has extended an entry ban for people coming from India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, as a continued precaution against the more transmissible Indian variant. The ban, which does not apply to Italian citizens, was introduced in late April and was due to expire on Sunday. It was prolonged until 21 June. Kenya has extended its nightly curfew by 60 days to slow the spread of Covid-19, the interior ministry said.","charCount":"28588","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/yohannes-lowe\">Yohannes Lowe</a> (now), <a href=\"profile/haroonsiddique\">Haroon Siddique</a> and <a href=\"profile/helen-livingstone\">Helen Livingstone</a> (earlier)"},{"headline":"French Open day two: Swiatek, Konta, Medvedev and Federer in action – live!","standfirst":"<ul><li>Updates from all Monday’s action at Roland Garros</li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/may/30/french-open-womens-singles-naomi-osaka-patricia-tig\">Osaka threatened with expulsion over media snub</a></li><li>Get in touch! <a href=\"mailto:daniel.harris.casual@theguardian.com\">Email Daniel</a> with your thoughts</li></ul>","trailText":"<strong>Live updates: </strong>Join Daniel Harris for another action-packed day at Roland Garros as the first round matches continue","byline":"Daniel Harris","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"250e4cf5d43e4f5602b7c8b6e87de45b8480ea5b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/250e4cf5d43e4f5602b7c8b6e87de45b8480ea5b/0_408_5102_3060/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Iga Swiatek of Poland serves against Kaja Juvan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Iga Swiatek of Poland serves against Kaja Juvan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clive Brunskill/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<div id=\"block-60b4c89d8f08d486a77185c3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-05-31T11:34:49.869Z\">12.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>More like it from Sinner, who rushes through a love hold which he seals with a dismissive forehand swipe.</strong> I fancy him for a break in Herbert’s next service game, and as I type that he’s handed a double then a poor volley.

What a day we’ve got for you today! Our show courts kick off with Iga Swiatek, who opens her title defence against Kaja Juvan – and with Jannik Sinner, the brilliant teenager who made the quarters last term, against the canny veteran Pierre-Hugues Herbert. When they’re done, we’ve got a bit of Daniil Medvedev, and later in the afternoon, there’ll be some Roger Federer, along with a frankly ridiculous matchup between last year’s defeated finalist, Sofia Kenin, and Jelena Ostapenko, the 2017 champions.

I fancy him for a break in Herbert’s next service game, and as I type that he’s handed a double then a poor volley. This is a chance, but a ridiculous whip cross-court to break the sideline followed by a composed overhead makes it 30-all, and shortly afterwards it’s 3-2. If Sinner didn’t know before, he knows now: he’ll have to take this, because Herbert won’t hand it over. Norrie, who’s had a bazzer of a spring, is broken by Fratengelo in the first game of the match, while Watson now leads Diyas 4-2. Herbert is absolutely loving it out there, bouncing off to his seat and gesticulating at the crowd as he makes it 2-1 in set four. Sinner needs to find something. Steve Johnson has clawed a set back off Francis Tiafoe; Tiafoe now leads 2-1. Juvan is doing much better in her second set against Switaek; it’s 5-5, following a first-set bagelling. On court six, Cam Norrie is about to get underway against Bjorn Fratangelo, the qualifier. Fratengelo won the boys’ competition in 2011, one of only three Americans so to do – the others are McEnroe in 1977 and Tommy Paul in 2015. In other British news, Watson still has her break and leads Diyas 3-2. Sinner has never won a match in five sets (which is what we were saying about Pablo Andujar until he beat Dominic Thiem yesterday). And there it is! Herbert serves out wide, Sinner nets, and Herbert leads 2-1! What an odd and invigorating set that was, Sinner disappearing, fighting back from 5-2, then sinking at the business end of the breaker! I’ve not a clue what’s coming next, but I can’t wait to enjoy it. Sinner 6-1 4-6 (4)6-7 Herbert At 3-3 in the breaker, Herbert mistimes a forehand, addressing the ball late and on his down-jump, swiping wide. But he immediately redeems the situation when Sinner misses with a forehand, then he does so again! It’s 5-4 Herbert, and if he wins two service points, he’s 2-1 in front! On Chatrier, Swiatek has been broken back by Juvan and now leads 6-0 4-3. Bertens is still trying to get back to where she was before she got injured, but that’s still a great win for Hercog who weathered the storm then rode it out. Sahe plays Siegemund or Garcia next. Back on Lenglen, Herbert has hung on for a breaker, and will fancy himself given his second serve and ability to produce the unexpected. But it’s Sinner who starts well, lashing a forehand winner down the line to hold. He meets Krajinovic or Marterer next; currently, Krajinovic leads by two sets to love. More agita from Bertens, who’s been broken for 5-4 – Hercog will now serve for the match – whole Watson has broken Diyas in the first game of their match. In commentary, they wonder if Sinner has recovered from whatever required him to get the trainer on – apparently he told him he felt strange – but he’s looking himself again now, and Herbert is serving to stay in a third set that was previously in his pocket. On court nine, Heather Watson is just underway – she’s playing Zarina Dias of Kazakhstan, ranked 22 places below her but better on clay. Oooh yeah! An outrageous backhand cross-court – from deep in the corner and almost facing the wrong way – gives Sinner 0-30, and Herbert then dumps a volley! That’s three break-back points ... and a majestic return means Sinner only needs one! From 2-5 he’s now 5-5, and that’s why he’s a superstar. Sinner 6-1 4-6 5-5 Herbert It’s Tan who’ll play Vondrousova next; she’s beaten Cornet 4 and 4. On Chatrier, it’s taken slightly longer in set two but Swiatek has broken again, so leads Juvan 6-0 3-1. Bertens has broken Hercog and will be in round two with two holds ... no she won’t, she’s broken back to 15 immediately; inwardly, her racket winces. Sinner, meanwhile has retrieved one of Herbert’s breaks and looks to be in working order again. Can he save the third set? That Sinner be rusty is not especially surprising, but given how beautifully he played in the first set, the drop-off is very odd. Herbert has improved a lot, but not enough to make someone so technical and tough look as ragged and tentative as he now does. HAVE A LOOK! Herbert earns a point for a double-break and seizes it with a sensational backhand down the line! Sinner is in all sorts here, being directed about the court by a player known better as a doubles champ. Can he respond? Sinner 6-1 4-6 2-5 Herbert That’s a bazzer of a comeback - Kanepi is a nasty first-round draw – and meets Tan or Cornet next. Currently, Tan leads 6-4 5-4. Tiafoe has taken the second set against Johnson to lead 2-0. I’m not sure clay is his surface, but I’d love to see him fulfil his potential; he’s got a lot to do to make that happen. Vondrousova has found herself and no mistake – she now leads Kanepi 5-0 in the decider, while Bertens and Hercog are at 2-2. Herbert’s second serve is working really well for him now, and he consolidates easily enough. If the pair of them keep playing as they are, there’s only one winner, and it’s him. Who expected that? Oh! At 30-40, Sinner finds a terrific second serve ... only for Herbert to find a terrificker return! This is a serious match now, Sinner’s forehand not where it was was and Herbert finding his top level. Can he keep it up? Sinner 6-1 4-6 2-3 Herbert Eeesh! Swiatek has reversed the birthday beats tradition, and punished best-mate Juvan to the tune of a 6-0 first set. She’s looking decent. Herbert is serving really well now and he and Sinner are locked at 2-2 in set three, while Vondrousova has her foot to the floor and leads Kanepi 3-0 in the decicer. Sinner, 2-1 up in set two, has the medical chaps on. They have a little red bottle out - perhaps he needs some Old Spice – and check one of his fingers. But he’s soon back on court, though Herbert seems to have some kind of problem which he takes up with umpire. I predicted more breakers in Querrey-Isner, but the number 31 seed has taken the second set 6-3 in much less time. It’s hard to see Querrey coming back from 2-0 down. Bertens is much happier with life now, and a further break, clinched when Hercog dumps a forehand into the net, seals the second set. The number 16 seed now looks well-placed to stamp on the gas and force her way into round two. Swiatek and Juvan are underway and it’s not taken long for superiority to be asserted, the champ holding and breaking from the get-go. Juvan 0-2 Switaek Excellent from Vondrousova, who consolidates the breaks again her hitting more consistent than that of the powerful but erratic Kanepi. That match is now level at one set all. Bravo Pierre-Hugues Herbert! After getting taken to school in the first set he serves out to take the second and looked pretty good doing it. Sinner 6-1 4-6 Herbert Calvin Betton returns with more on Sinner: “He’s basically emotionless. I asked an Italian coach I know about him and he told me that it’s because he’s from a part of Italy that the Italians don’t really count as Italy. They think it’s more Austria. Everyone from there is very un-Italian. They’re calm, don’t show emotion, are very serious in their ways and demeanour.” That’s really interesting, and the man is now facing Herbert’s serve, 4-5 down in set two; if he can’t find a break, we’re all-square. Tiafoe has taken the breaker against Johnson, while things are hotting up in the women’s competition. Bertens is 4-1 up on Hercog in set two, and Hercog, who won the first 6-1, is vexed about an umpire’s call. Momentum looks to have switched there ... and might be about to do so elsewhere, where Vondrousova has three break points. She takes the third thanks to a double from Kanepi, who now leads 6-4 3-4. Thanks in significant part to a second-serve ace at 30-all, Herbert has consolidated his break to lead Sinner 5-3 in set two. On Chatrier, Iga Swiatek, on her 20th birthday, is coming out to play Kaia Juvan – her best mate. Great stuff. The second set on Lenglen has been much more competitive, and Herbert has just broken Sinner again; can he hold on this time? Isner has taken his breaker against Querrey; I daresay we may see another one or several before that mtch is out. Bertens hasn’t been the best of moods this morning, but she’s just squash-shotted a complete misjudgment that looked like looping into the net. So Hercog stood over it, then watched in horror as it clipped the cord, flipped over and died, handing Bertens three break-points; she takes the second and now leads 2-1 in set two having ceded the first 6-1. Yeah, very funny mate. Sinner has broken Herbert back, of course he has, and it’s not 2-2 in set two, Sinner having won the first 6-1. On court seven, Johnson and Tiafoe are back on serve, while on 14, Isner is up a mini-break against Querrey. Great stuff from Kaia Kanepi, who’s come back from a double-break down to take the first set against Vondrousova, the number 20 seed, 6-4. Hello! Herbert is into this now, and skids into the net to lap a lush backhand drop along the net for his first break of the match! Sinner is under a bit of pressure, so it’ll be good to see how he responds. Meanwhile, Bertens tosses a break point and remonstrates with her racket in the strongest terms. That’ll teach it. Bertens is a in a bind, following her break with a drop; Hercog takes the first set 6-1. Elsewhere, Tiafoe is up 4-3 on Johnson with a break, Vondrousova has lost her other break and trails Kanepi 4-5, while Isner and Querrey are 5-5. Ah man, Sinner is a joke. Finding himself 30-40 down, he hammers down a belting second serve then plays two more tremendous points and that’s got be soul-crushing for Herbert. At 0-5 down to Hercog, Bertens earns a break point, and though the set is almost definitely gone she’ll want to assert herself prior to the next one ... and she does, a gorgeous backhand slice from well behind the line making it 1-5. Wow, Sinner has broken again to take the first set 6-1, and is steaming hot. As if by magic, Calvin returns to qualify his Tsitsipas prediction: “Or Sinner. He’s [redacted] phenomenal. And a killer.” Sinner is now 5-1 in front and purring. Meantime, Calvin Betton, a tennis coach mate of mine reckons Tsitsipas will be the next new major-winner, Tiafoe won’t get there and Auger Aliassime is a worry because though he was a brilliant junior, he’s not improved over the last few years. “His second serve is a major problem,” he says. “He got a golden opportunity that tennis players don’t get, coz of covid: to spend three months working on a specific area of his game with no competition or scrutiny. And it’s no better than it was before.” When I watch Sinner – and Auger Aliassime and Tiafoe – and Tsitsipas and Medvedev – I wonder when they’ll be allowed to win a Slam. It’s impossible to look further than Nadal and Djokovic here, then Djokovic and Federer at Wimbledon. The first group aren[t quite ready but the second pair really are – and yet. Vondrousova, who got to the final in 2019 as a teenager, was up a double break against the veteran Kanepi; Kanepi has retrieved one so is 1-3 down, while Hercog is 3-0 up on Bertens and serving. Sinner is going to be an absolute superstar; he’s just such a natural, and after consolidating his break we see him dash to the net and flip over a winner; at 30-all, Herbert is under pressure again. But Herbert keeps the head and wins two quick points to get on the board, 1-2 and a break down. Sinner has started well, breaking Herbert in the first game; Hercog has done likewise to Bertens, the number 15 seed. FYI: for now, I’m watching Bertens v Hercog, Kanepi v Vondrousova and Sinner v Herbert. But I may check Johnson v Tiafoe.

Green party member Sarah Green unsuccessfully tried freedom of information requests and the information commissioner to gain access to the internal analysis of risk to water supplies from the HS2 project before a tribunal ruled in her favour, ordering the rail company to disclose three unredacted water risk assessments to her.</p> <p>These documents reveal that six public water sources, including at Blackford and Northmoor in Hillingdon and West Hyde, Amersham, Chalfont St Giles and Little Missenden in Buckinghamshire, may need additional treatment works. Some may need to close during construction and others are awaiting planned closures.</p> <p>HS2 said it acknowledged the potential risks to the water supply and was putting appropriate mitigation measures in place.</p> <p>The campaigners said this could result in the public receiving more heavily treated or processed water through their taps, or of aquifer water that is piped into the homes of millions of people being replaced by treated surface water.</p> <p>The documents also show there is uncertainty about precisely what the impact of some of the construction work will be on some parts of the water supply.</p> <p>One of the documents – a groundwater assessment relating to the construction and operation of the Chiltern tunnel, a 16km tunnel that will carry HS2 beneath the M25 – finds there is a risk of migration of grout or cement that could impact on water quality and that some of the work could potentially reduce yields of public and private water supplies.</p> <p>The report into options for mitigation of the effects of piling on ground water states that the nature and extent of construction activities where water is abstracted makes the creation of chalk turbidity “inevitable”.</p> <p>“Due to the high risk and high uncertainty mitigation will therefore be required to manage the potential effect of chalk turbidity on public water supplies,” the report states.</p> <p>It adds that one of the water companies in the area where construction work is being carried out, Affinity Water, “has concerns that even small changes in the influx of lake or gravel water to the abstraction borehole could have significant effects on water quality”.” The company abstracts 69m litres of water per day.</p> <p>The Environment Agency approved environmental aspects of HS2’s plans relating to construction of the Chiltern tunnel on 23 April.</p> <p>A spokesperson said: ”The Environment Agency does not grant planning permission for HS2 works. This is the responsibility of the relevant local planning authority. However, we are responsible for issuing consent relating to matters on land drainage, flood defence, water resources and fisheries. We take this responsibility very seriously, as well as the protection of the wildlife and ecosystems around HS2.”</p> <p>Carolyne Culver, the Green party candidate for the Chesham and Amersham parliamentary byelection said: “First HS2 came for the ancient woodlands, farmers’ land and people’s homes and now it’s coming for our drinking water. The government is risking public health for this vanity train-set whose paper-thin business case evaporated when Covid came along.”</p> <p>A spokesperson for Affinity Water previously told the Guardian it had taken “significant steps” to protect water sources in the area from harm.</p> <p>A freedom of information response obtained by the Guardian from Natural England reveals that 38 different licences have been granted to HS2 to carry out activities in areas including Uxbridge, Northamptonshire, Solihull and Buckinghamshire.

The documents were revealed following a battle lasting more than two years. Green party member Sarah Green unsuccessfully tried freedom of information requests and the information commissioner to gain access to the internal analysis of risk to water supplies from the HS2 project before a tribunal ruled in her favour, ordering the rail company to disclose three unredacted water risk assessments to her. These documents reveal that six public water sources, including at Blackford and Northmoor in Hillingdon and West Hyde, Amersham, Chalfont St Giles and Little Missenden in Buckinghamshire, may need additional treatment works. Some may need to close during construction and others are awaiting planned closures. HS2 said it acknowledged the potential risks to the water supply and was putting appropriate mitigation measures in place. The campaigners said this could result in the public receiving more heavily treated or processed water through their taps, or of aquifer water that is piped into the homes of millions of people being replaced by treated surface water. The documents also show there is uncertainty about precisely what the impact of some of the construction work will be on some parts of the water supply. One of the documents – a groundwater assessment relating to the construction and operation of the Chiltern tunnel, a 16km tunnel that will carry HS2 beneath the M25 – finds there is a risk of migration of grout or cement that could impact on water quality and that some of the work could potentially reduce yields of public and private water supplies. The report into options for mitigation of the effects of piling on ground water states that the nature and extent of construction activities where water is abstracted makes the creation of chalk turbidity “inevitable”. “Due to the high risk and high uncertainty mitigation will therefore be required to manage the potential effect of chalk turbidity on public water supplies,” the report states. It adds that one of the water companies in the area where construction work is being carried out, Affinity Water, “has concerns that even small changes in the influx of lake or gravel water to the abstraction borehole could have significant effects on water quality”.” The company abstracts 69m litres of water per day. The Environment Agency approved environmental aspects of HS2’s plans relating to construction of the Chiltern tunnel on 23 April. A spokesperson said: ”The Environment Agency does not grant planning permission for HS2 works. This is the responsibility of the relevant local planning authority. However, we are responsible for issuing consent relating to matters on land drainage, flood defence, water resources and fisheries. We take this responsibility very seriously, as well as the protection of the wildlife and ecosystems around HS2.” Carolyne Culver, the Green party candidate for the Chesham and Amersham parliamentary byelection said: “First HS2 came for the ancient woodlands, farmers’ land and people’s homes and now it’s coming for our drinking water. The government is risking public health for this vanity train-set whose paper-thin business case evaporated when Covid came along.” A spokesperson for Affinity Water previously told the Guardian it had taken “significant steps” to protect water sources in the area from harm. A freedom of information response obtained by the Guardian from Natural England reveals that 38 different licences have been granted to HS2 to carry out activities in areas including Uxbridge, Northamptonshire, Solihull and Buckinghamshire. The majority of licences relate to bats but permits have also been granted in areas where there are badgers, great crested newts and the hazel or common dormouse. The permits include mitigation licences in areas where trees used by bats will be felled. A spokesperson for HS2 said: “All of our ecology work is carried out in accordance with the law and is designed to minimise disturbance to wildlife, including bats, badgers and great crested newts.

But barely 200m from his home, a motorcycle closed in and the pillion passenger pulled a handgun, peppering the car with bullets. Alonso’s bodyguard returned fire, and the attackers fled. The candidate had escaped injury, but was later sent to hospital suffering from stress. “When you get into politics, you know there could be repercussions, but never to this degree” said Alonso, 36, from his sickbed.

Campaigning has been suspended in dozens of municipalities around the country due to violence. The ruling Morena party stopped campaigning in the southern part of the state of Mexico – the country’s most populous region, which wraps around Mexico City – after an ambush in March killed 13 state and federal police officers. Morena’s party president Mario Delgado tweeted on Friday that he and two other politicians were intercepted by gunmen with assault weapons in the state of Tamaulipas, a hotbed of organised crime, but released unharmed. “There are some municipalities where you campaign, but can’t talk about municipal matters, others where you can bring in a campaign team, but can’t hold rallies,” said Isaac Monroy, the Morena delegate in state of Mexico.

You appreciate the technical expertise in Björfors’ production, but take little away other than admiration for her performers’ skill. • Until 13 June; each performance live streamed (£)","charCount":"2095","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"true","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/andrewclements\">Andrew Clements</a>"},{"headline":"UK growth upgraded but OECD warns of deepest economic scar in G7","standfirst":"<p>Thinktank feels Brexit and Covid-19 mean Britain could take bigger economic hit over next few years</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus – latest updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul>","trailText":"Thinktank feels Brexit and Covid-19 mean Britain could take bigger economic hit over next few years","byline":"Graeme Wearden","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"da5ddff0f8359049fd42038e780e022a92ad017a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da5ddff0f8359049fd42038e780e022a92ad017a/42_199_3416_2050/1000.jpg\" alt=\"London skyline view of the City financial district\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The OECD expects the UK economy to post its fastest growth since the second world war this year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Louis Berk/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>The UK economy will post its fastest growth since the second world war this year but also faces deeper economic scarring than other major economies, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has predicted.</p> <p>In its latest economic outlook, the Paris-based thinktank sharply upgraded its view for UK growth, thanks to the success of the Covid-19 vaccination programme.</p> <p>It forecasts UK GDP will rise by 7.2% in 2021, the fastest growth since 1941, after a 9.8% contraction in 2020 – the worst in almost 300 years. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/mar/09/covid-19-vaccines-stimulus-global-growth-oecd\">Back in March</a>, it had forecast UK growth of 5.1% this year.

In its latest economic outlook, the Paris-based thinktank sharply upgraded its view for UK growth, thanks to the success of the Covid-19 vaccination programme. It forecasts UK GDP will rise by 7.2% in 2021, the fastest growth since 1941, after a 9.8% contraction in 2020 – the worst in almost 300 years. Back in March, it had forecast UK growth of 5.1% this year. For 2022, growth has been revised significantly higher, too – to 5.5%, from 4.7% three months ago. However, the OECD also warns that the UK could suffer a bigger economic hit over the next few years than other G7 industrialised nations because of the impact of Brexit and the pandemic. The OECD said the UK’s services sector would rebound briskly this year as retailers, pubs, restaurants and other hospitality businesses reopened after the lockdown. “The progressive easing of public health restrictions will allow for a solid rebound,” the OECD explained. “Consumption will bounce back sharply as hard-hit hospitality services and retail trade reopen.” The OECD also predicts that households will spend some of the savings accrued during the lockdown – but cautions that the less well-off families have suffered more from the coronavirus pandemic. “Some additional spending by wealthier households with secure jobs and excess savings during the crisis is projected to be counterbalanced by households in lower-income brackets who saved less during the crisis and are set to be more affected by a weak labour market and the winding down of Covid-19 supports.” The UK’s unemployment rate is forecast to rise to 6.1% by the end of the year as the furlough scheme ends, up from 4.8% in the first quarter of 2021. The report also warns that “increased border costs following the exit from the EU single market will continue to weigh on foreign trade”. The OECD said: “Trade contracted in early 2021 as a consequence of leaving the EU single market and containment measures but will recover slowly.” It added that a closer relationship with the EU, particularly for services trade, would improve the UK’s medium-term economic outlook. Official figures last week showed that UK-EU trade fell by almost a quarter at the start of 2021, compared with 2018. The OECD has also raised its forecast for the world economy this year, with widespread vaccination deployment allowing firms to reopen and the US president Joe Biden’s stimulus plans boosting global demand. It predicts global growth of 5.8% this year and 4.4% in 2022, up from 5.6% and 4.0% respectively back in March. The US is forecast to grow by 6.9% this year, up from the 6.5% forecast in March, while eurozone growth has been upgraded to 4.3%, from 3.9%. However, the OECD’s chief economist, Laurence Boone, said that the recovery was uneven, with “lots of frictions”. She warned that new Covid-19 variants could derail the recovery, underlining the importance of ensuring emerging economies are vaccinated, too. “It is very disturbing that not enough vaccines are reaching emerging and low-income economies. This is exposing these economies to a fundamental threat because they have less policy capacity to support activity than advanced economies,” Boone said. As long as the vast majority of the global population is not vaccinated, the whole world remains vulnerable to the emergence of new variants, she added. “Confidence could be seriously eroded by further lockdowns, and a stop-and-go of economic activities. Firms, so far well protected but often with higher debt than before the pandemic, could go bankrupt. The most vulnerable members of society would risk further suffering from prolonged spells of inactivity or reduced income, exacerbating inequalities, across and within countries, and potentially destabilising economies.” Scientists have warned UK ministers that a third wave of coronavirus may have already begun in Britain, which could hit plans to lift England’s lockdown restrictions in three weeks’ time. The OECD also examined how much potential output has been lost because of the coronavirus crisis, by comparing its latest projections for national income levels in 2025 with its pre-pandemic forecasts. It found that Japan and Canada will only suffer small losses, while the US is likely to have even bigger national income than it previously thought because of massive fiscal support. However, major eurozone members could experience a 0.3% annual decline in potential economic output, while the UK’s growth rate could be 0.5% a year lower than previously expected. The OECD said this was partly down to the impact of leaving the EU, as well as Covid-19. “The United Kingdom could suffer the biggest reduction among G7 countries (a decline of 0.5 percentage point per annum), in part reflecting the additional adverse supply-side effects from 2021 following Brexit.”","charCount":"5043","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/graemewearden\">Graeme Wearden</a>"},{"headline":"UK cannabis campaigners take note: in the US, change came from below","standfirst":"<p>Sadiq Khan’s decriminalisation commission could put pressure on the government to change its policy</p>","trailText":"Sadiq Khan’s decriminalisation commission could put pressure on the government to change its policy, says author Andrew Gumbel","byline":"Andrew Gumbel","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fb5b3499ae3fc9439e961250c9c7680cdfc80b9b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb5b3499ae3fc9439e961250c9c7680cdfc80b9b/0_117_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Weed World in New York\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘If established and regulated properly, the legal market brings a previously clandestine activity into the open and makes it safer and more accountable.’ Weed World in New York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kena Betancur/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Take a stroll down Abbot Kinney Boulevard, the high street for hipsters in Venice Beach, California, and alongside the brightly painted boutiques offering vintage T-shirts or oat-spiced lattes, you’ll find a sleek, bright red storefront with plate-glass windows that, at first glance, is easy to mistake for a car showroom.</p> <p>Instead of cars, though, it sells high-end cannabis products: Huckleberry Gummies, Keef root beer, concentrates, creams and lotions, rolled joints and vaporisers, all laid out on carefully curated wooden tables.

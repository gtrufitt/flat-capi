It’s so nice to play here in front of fans, you make it enjoyable for players. Thank you very much.” She is asked about her decision to go on the road during the Covid and stands by it, speaking with family every day. It wasn’t always pretty, but Barty is through. Pera was broken once again to finish, not helped by the No1’s massive backhand return. But she done well, definitely looks like a player on the rise. Barty can see the finish line. Pera, who has done so little wrong until the last five minutes, miscues her forehand again, which is all the number one seed requires to press the advantage. A wild backhand error finishes the game, Pera now serving to stay in the match at 2-5. Barty breaks! Pera’s serve has been in good shape but the 2019 winner hung in there and opened up an opportunity of her own, the American whack a rudimentary forehand into the net. It’s 4-2. Barty is building, holding to love. A handy time for an easy game, built on the back of a fantastic rally at 15-0, followed in with her fourth ace of the match. Big game experience helps her here. It’s 2-2 in the third. Pera bangs a forehand winner down the line, holding from 40-30. Back to you, Ash Barty. A tough hold for Barty, getting through two break points. On both occasions, she was saved by her big serve. Between times, Pera continues to create opportunities with her dynamic backhand, beating the Australan down the line with a beauty. Meanwhile, on Court Suzanne-Lenglen, Monfils has won the the third set 6-4. “Not saying in any way that Barty’s problem wasn’t genuine,” I’m tweeted, “but perhaps they should abolish the medical time out and replace it with a five minute break between sets, which is then fair to both players.” I don’t mind the status quo. All part of the theatre. A game apiece in the third on Court Philippe-Chartier, both Barty and Pera holding from 40-30. On Barty’s injury, it was her left glute being worked on, strapping now visible down her thigh. Boris Becker has weighed in with Osaka, this report via Reuters. “I heard her first response a couple of days ago about this media boycott and that is something to be always taken seriously, especially from such a young woman,” Becker told Eurosport for whom he works as an analyst. “She couldn’t cope with the pressures of facing the media after she loses a match, but that happens frequently and you have to deal with it. “If she can’t cope with the media in Paris, she can’t cope with the media in Wimbledon or the U.S. Open. So I almost feel like her career is in danger due to mental health issues.” That doesn’t strike me as particularly helpful commentary from Boom Boom. On this, Jonathan Liew’s piece is worth a read. Monfils holds; he’s up 5-3 in the third. Barty is back on her feet too, serving in the first game of the third and deciding set. Ash Barty has taken an injury time out. They are working on the top of her thigh between sets. Testing times for the top seed. Around the courts, Gael Monfils, the 14th seed, has pulled level at one set apiece after dropping the first to Albert Ramos-Vinolas. The Frenchman was gutted after losing on the opening day at Melbourne Park - he’ll be desperate to clear that bar at his home Grand Slam. Indeed, he now has a break in the third, serving at 4-3. Going well. Bernarda Pera wins the second set 6-3! Barty is going to have to do it the hard way with the 70th ranked player in the world holding her nerve when it mattered most. She had to get through a break point after missing a backhand volley, but repsonded with a couple of big serves before closing out the set. They’re one set all. Barty holds after giving Pera a set point when swinging wildly at 30-all. The Australian responds with a pair of forehand winners - crosscourt with power then a classy topspin effort - to shift the game back in her favour. Over to Pera, serving for the second set. Afternoon, all. Barty away well in the first, under pressure now. Reminds me of how she was bundled out of the Australian Open January. I was there at the time and, needless to say, it didn’t go over well with the locals. She gets a look at a 15-30 here but her floating forehand is long. Pera responds with a crunching down-the-line winner at 30-all then holds. Barty will serve to stay in the set at 2-5. Ok, time now to hand over to the excellent Adam Collins for the afternoon’s play. À bientôt. Barty not having it so easy, with Pera 4-1 up in the second set, and her second serve not doing its job. She’s back at 2-4 now but needs to find a way through her opponent’s serve. Struff and Rublev is really turning into quite the slugfest, with each man threatening the other’s serve. But no break as yet in the third set, with the Russian in peril. Cheers can be heard across Roland Garros as Monfils takes a second set tie-break 8-6 against Albert Ramos Viñolas to level the sets at 1-1. Some recovery after losing the first 6-1. Barty has taken the first set against Pera 6-4, and has found her groove after those attritional first few games. Rublev, with some vocal support from some Russian-sounding rowdies in the crowd, turns around the tie-break to go 4-3 up. Then it goes to 4-4. Then 5-5, it’s a very tight match. Struff serves a very timely ace and he has set point. Rublev saves that with an ace of his own. Then Rublev rages as his volley gives Struff chance to claim another set point. And Struff booms a wonderful serve to lead the seventh seed 2-0. Rublev v Struff has gone to a tie-break in the second set, with Struff already a set up. And here’s Tumaini Carayol on the Osaka question. Simon Baker, the four-time Olympian walker for Australia, has got in touch on the subject of Naomi Osaka: “Workplace bullying is alive and well in tennis world. Treatment of Ms Osaka highlights hypocrisy of sports run by old male pale bean counters.” And Barty gets the break again, she’s 3-2 up on Pera. Meanwhile, Gaël Monfils, the local lad, is in a bit of trouble, losing the first set 6-1 to Albert Ramos Viñolas. It’s 4-4 in the second set. It’s 2-2 between Barty and Pera. They seem evenly matched at present, with both breaking the other. Andrey Rublev, the seventh men’s seed is having a ding dong with Jan-Lennard Struff but is 5-2 up in the second set, Struff having won the first set 6-3. Pera serves out the first game against Barty, but with some difficulty, as it takes in several deuces. She has trouble with her first serve all game yet wins it with an ace. Ashleigh Barty is imminent on Philippe-Chatrier, taking on Bernarda Pera. Barty did not defend her 2019 title, deciding not to travel in October last year in the wake of Covid-19. The fifth seed is through in the women’s singles, nice and easy for Elina Svitolina against the qualifier, Française Océane Babel. De Minaur delivers a handy service hold to take the third set to a tie-breaker. Travaglia is going down fighting, that’s for sure. De Minaur goes 2-0 up, then it goes to 2-1, then 3-1 when Travaglia crashes into the net. Next, the Italian goes far too long for 4-1. And again for 5-1, his grip ever loosening. Next, De Minaur is sent skidding as it goes to 5-2. When it goes to 5-3 there’s a wobble in the offing. Next comes 5-4. De Minaur has two serves to go through. Then match point is reached when Travaglia wallops one long once again. Then Travaglia nets and the Australian is through. But no, Travaglia has broken back for 3-3 and it’s back with serve against De Minaur. And he serves out to love to go 4-3 up. This ain’t over. De Minaur is now 3-2 up, two sets up and a break up against Travaglia. He’s looking good for the win now. A couple more results from today’s early matches. France’s Fiona Ferro is through, having beaten Liang En-shuo. And Ons Jabeur beat Yulia Putintseva 7-5 6-2. Another result in. Per AP Australian Open runner-up Jennifer Brady breezed past Anastasija Sevastova to reach the second round and match her best performance at the French Open. The 13th-seeded American, who has never reached the third round at Roland Garros, won 6-3, 6-3 after breaking Sevastova at love in the final game. Brady is not a clay specialist. She played only one tournament on the surface last year, losing her opening match at Roland Garros. She achieved her best result on clay earlier this season when she made it to the third round in Madrid in the buildup to the French Open. De Minaur is now two sets up on Travaglia, having won the second 6-4. He’s looking good for the win. Another Australian, Astra Sharma, won in the women’s singles, having beaten Irina Bara 7-6 6-2. Colin Watts gets in touch. As somebody who regularly faces disability-discrimination (rather than mental health) I can understand her plight; particularly when LBGT and racial issues are now (hopefully) becoming socially unacceptable. Much has already been said in the excellent blog by Jonathan Liew; the intolerance shewn by to Ms Osaka in respect of her health and well being beggars belief. Indeed I would suggest the French Tennis Federation’s actions could be tantamount to bullying with the ‘excuse of player contractual obligations’ being morally repugnant. If this was (say) a disability ‘contractual obligations’ would ultimately not be accepted. PS - I note the French Tennis Federation read a prepared statement Osaka their support but declined to accept questions from the media! With a typically crushing shot, Sakkari beats Zavatska 6-4 6-1, having really stepped it up in that second set. Sakkari is cruising into the second round, having twice broken Zavatska, she is serving at 4-0 up in the second set. Carla Suárez Navarro will return to the Roland Garros court today, having been forced to retire because of Hodgkin’s lymphoma, before making her comeback. She plays Sloane Stephens this afternoon. Sakkari has taken the first set against Zavatska 6-4. Liang En-shuo and Fiona Ferro, on Court Suzanne-Lenglen, has gone to a third set, both winning their sets by 6-1. Osaka has been receiving support back in Japan. Per Reuters. “The first thing to be considered is Ms. Osaka’s health. I wish her the earliest possible recovery,” Japan Tennis Association (JTA) Executive Director Toshihisa Tsuchihashi said in a statement. Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato told a news conference that he would “watch over her quietly” and there was concern on the streets of Tokyo for the woman who will be one of the faces of this year’s Olympic Games in the city. “I think she’s under a lot of pressure, more than we can imagine,” kimono dresser Tomomi Noguchi, 67, told Reuters. She got to the top when she was young so I think we can’t really imagine what she’s going through.” Vickie Skorji, who manages a helpline at TELL, a non-profit counselling service in Japan, said society needed to be “more respectful and supportive” of mental health. “Who has asked her how she is doing? She put out a statement and said ‘I need to take care of myself,’ and she’s been punished,” Skorji said. “I think she is courageous and needs support.” And De Minaur takes that first set 6-2, nice and easy so far for him. Japan’s Yasutaka Uchiyama has taken the first set 6-3 against the Italian, Marco Cecchinato. Per Reuters, on Osaka. There was some criticism of Roland Garros organisers for their handling of the matter. French Tennis Federation President Gilles Moretton read a prepared statement on Monday offering Osaka their support but the irony of him not taking questions, given the context of the row, was not lost on some. “So the FFT handled the Ms Osaka mental health concerns without empathy or sensitivity. Then the FFT President refuses to take questions at a presser. An own goal,” wrote former Australian tennis official Richard Ings. Alex de Minaur, the Australian 21st seed, has got himself in a commanding position in the first set against Stefano Travaglia. He’s winning 5-1, and serving well. It does look tres beau. Some big names from across sport have spoken out for Osaka. Martina Navratilova: I am so sad about Naomi Osaka. I truly hope she will be ok. As athletes we are taught to take care of our body, and perhaps the mental and emotional aspect gets short shrift. This is about more than doing or not doing a press conference. Good luck Naomi - we are all pulling for you! Billie-Jean King: It’s incredibly brave that Naomi Osaka has revealed her truth about her struggle with depression. Right now, the important thing is that we give her the space and time she needs. We wish her well. NBA legend Steph Curry: You shouldn’t ever have to make a decision like this - but so damn impressive taking the high road when the powers that be don’t protect their own. Major respect. Which leaves Piers Morgan. Far more to come on Osaka throughout the day, but we begin with some low-key stuff on the courts. Katarina Zavatska has just broken Maria Sakkari, the 17th seed, but is then immediately broken back. A glance at the Eurosport coverage see Babsi Schett, Boris Becker and Mats Wilander skirt the Osaka issue in a very quick intro but it won’t be going away. Serena Williams, after winning her first round match yesterday, had this to say. Of course, the big news at Roland Garros has not yet centred on what has happened on the court. There will be fallout through the day on Naomi Osaka’s withdrawal, and the press conferences will probably revolve around what press conferences are for, and met with sidesteps as neat as anything you see on the clay. Nevertheless, the show must - and will - go on and the return of Nadal to his kingdom will perhaps cool the unfortunate circus that has formed around l’affaire Osaka. He begins his campaign for his 14th (fourteenth) title by meeting the Australian, Alexei Popyrin, on Philippe-Chatrier. Before that, the 2019 women’s champions and number one seed, Ashleigh Barty, takes on Bernarda Pera, the American-Croatian.

The only thing we know, he helpfully suggests, is that we don’t know.</p> <p>Here’s a flash of his column. </p> <blockquote> <p>England faces the tensest two weeks of its entire lockdown. On 14 June, the government must decide if the long-promised “freedom day” of 21 June can proceed as promised. That promise has now been plunged into doubt. A three-day surge in “cases” of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/31/india-covid-variant-spreading-across-england-data-shows\">variant of Covid first detected in India</a> may, or may not, mark the start of a third wave of the coronavirus. Boris Johnson has promised that any more lockdown will be over his dead body, but Johnson’s body has already lost more lives than the proverbial cat.</p> <p>We now know, thanks to the new patron saint of whistleblowers, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/dominic-cummings\">Dominic Cummings</a>, the scale of government ineptitude and shambles that attended the first two lockdowns. People can now scream at ministers to make up their minds, show judgment, give a steer, keep their promises. But today the issue is not one of judgment, but of facts. We await data much as a nation awaits news of a battle in distant parts. Without news, we cannot think how to act.</p> <p>The caveats are easy to recite. We hear them every day. Has not Britain’s campaign of vaccination and treatment curbed what is still a rampant disease across Europe? Perhaps the upsurge in cases is due to the intensity of testing in hotspots such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/31/blackburn-with-darwen-overtakes-bolton-to-top-uk-list-of-most-new-covid-cases\">Bolton and Blackburn</a>. There is no sign of the upsurge reflected in hospital admissions, let alone deaths. Surely we have spent all this money showing the NHS can handle any new wave without lockdown. Thousands of businesses and the country’s morale will be devastated if promises of normality on 21 June are not met.</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/01/freedom-day-england-21-june-covid\">Will ‘freedom day’ go ahead?

Many of the scientists who’ve been talking over the weekend simply haven’t adjusted their expectations to understand that - (for these people) Covid is a mild illness in the community.</p> <p>As the Director of Public Health Bolton was saying last week, the people who are going into hospital... it’s not like January, these are not desperately ill people.</p> <p>They’re people who need a little bit of extra support with oxygen, they need access to the dexamethasone treatment, which is very effective.</p> <p>They go in, stay in hospital for three or four days and they go out again.

NHS England said 33,009,444 were the first dose of a vaccine, a rise of 70,948 on the previous day, while 21,874,135 were a second dose, an increase of 154,674. There have been no further Covid-19 deaths recorded by Stormont’s Department of Health in the last 24-hour reporting period. There were another 54 confirmed cases of the virus recorded. On Tuesday morning there were 20 confirmed Covid-19 inpatients in hospital, of whom two were in intensive care. The vast majority of Scotland’s central belt will remain in Level 2 restrictions, Nicola Sturgeon has said. The first minister said that Edinburgh and Midlothian, Dundee, East Dunbartonshire, Renfrewshire, East Renfrewshire, North, South and East Ayrshire, North and South Lanarkshire, Clackmannanshire and Stirling did not meet the criteria to see restrictions ease. Sturgeon told MSPs there could even be an argument to move these areas into Level 3 restrictions, given the raw figures, but the impact of the vaccination programme has meant this would not be needed. She said: However, it is important to stress that this is a pause, not a step backwards. And Level 2 is not lockdown. It does have an impact on opening hours of pubs and restaurants and the numbers that can attend certain events. And taking a cautious approach now - while more people get fully vaccinated - gives us the best chance of staying on the right track overall. Sturgeon has said 18 local authorities will see restrictions ease this weekend. The first minister told MSPs that Highland, Argyll &amp; Bute, Aberdeen City and Aberdeenshire, Moray, Angus, Perth &amp; Kinross, Falkirk, Fife, Inverclyde, East and West Lothian, West Dunbartonshire, Dumfries &amp; Galloway and the Borders would move to Level 1 restrictions from Saturday. The changes mean more people will be able to meet both indoors and outdoors, while soft play centres and funfairs will be able to open, the First Minister said. Meanwhile, Shetland, Orkney and the Western Isles council areas would move to Level 0. But Sturgeon urged caution as the restrictions ease, reminding Scots that outdoor meetings were less likely to cause transmission of the virus. Glasgow is to move from Level 3 to Level 2 of the Scottish Government’s coronavirus restrictions from Saturday, Nicola Sturgeon has said. Updating MSPs in Holyrood the First Minister said Scotland’s biggest city, which had been held back due to recent case spikes, will see restrictions ease. Sturgeon said the situation in Glasgow appears to be stabilising, with case rates falling from 146 per 100,000 to 129 in recent days. The first minister said: This means that people in Glasgow - as has been the case in most of the rest of Scotland since mid-May - will be able to meet in homes in groups of no more than six, from a maximum of three households. It also means that indoor licensed hospitality can reopen, and that people can travel again between Glasgow and the other parts of Scotland. A number of venues will also be permitted to reopen, and outdoor adult contact sports can resume. These changes are significant. As someone who lives in Glasgow, I know they will make a huge difference to quality of life. The Guardian columnist Simon Jenkins has written on the topic on everyone’s lips right now, will “freedom day” - the lifting of the last lockdown restrictions on 21 June - go ahead? The only thing we know, he helpfully suggests, is that we don’t know. Here’s a flash of his column. England faces the tensest two weeks of its entire lockdown. On 14 June, the government must decide if the long-promised “freedom day” of 21 June can proceed as promised. That promise has now been plunged into doubt. A three-day surge in “cases” of the variant of Covid first detected in India may, or may not, mark the start of a third wave of the coronavirus. Boris Johnson has promised that any more lockdown will be over his dead body, but Johnson’s body has already lost more lives than the proverbial cat. We now know, thanks to the new patron saint of whistleblowers, Dominic Cummings, the scale of government ineptitude and shambles that attended the first two lockdowns. People can now scream at ministers to make up their minds, show judgment, give a steer, keep their promises. But today the issue is not one of judgment, but of facts. We await data much as a nation awaits news of a battle in distant parts. Without news, we cannot think how to act. The caveats are easy to recite. We hear them every day. Has not Britain’s campaign of vaccination and treatment curbed what is still a rampant disease across Europe? Perhaps the upsurge in cases is due to the intensity of testing in hotspots such as Bolton and Blackburn. There is no sign of the upsurge reflected in hospital admissions, let alone deaths. Surely we have spent all this money showing the NHS can handle any new wave without lockdown. Thousands of businesses and the country’s morale will be devastated if promises of normality on 21 June are not met. Ninety-four more people have tested positive for coronavirus in Wales, taking the total number of confirmed infections in the country so far to 212,796. According to the latest data released by Public Health Wales on Tuesday, there had been no new deaths attributed to Covid-19. The total pandemic death toll in the country stood at 5,569. Public Health Wales said a total of 2,147,274 first doses of the Covid-19 vaccine had now been given and 1,118,396 second doses have also been administered. Boris Johnson sees nothing in current coronavirus data to suggest the end to coronavirus lockdown restrictions will need to be delayed past 21 June, Downing Street has indicated. According to PA Media, a No 10 spokesman was asked about the prime minister’s plans amid the warnings over the spread of the variant first detected in India, which now accounts for three quarters of new infections in the UK. Over the past few days, a number of government scientific advisers have gone on the record to urge caution over the end to lockdown. There have been repeated warnings that the country is possibly in the early stages of a third wave of pandemic. PA Media quoted the prime minister’s spokesman as saying: “I was going to point to what the PM said on Thursday. “The prime minister has said on a number of occasions that we haven’t seen anything in the data but we will continue to look at the data, we will continue to look at the latest scientific evidence as we move through June towards 21 June.” Last Thursday, Johnson said “I don’t see anything currently in the data” to divert from the 21 June. But he did concede that “we may need to wait” for more data. (This is Damien Gayle at the controls of the live blog for the next hour or so, while Nicola has a break.) The widespread rise in Covid-19 cases has led to a small rise in hospital admissions on a national level, according to Guardian analysis of NHS data. The seven-day average figure for England showed that 88 patients were admitted to hospital on 26 May, up from 81 patients on average two weeks previously. In the North West, which contains a number of Covid hotspots, the seven-day average for new daily hospital admissions has risen to 23 patients, up from 13 two weeks previously. In other regions, admissions continued to fall or rose slightly. Hospitalisation figures remain well below numbers seen in the peaks of previous waves. There is a median delay of up to 10 days between symptom onset and hospitalisation, according to research, so we may not yet have seen the full impact of recent Covid-19 outbreaks. Covid-19 case rates are starting to rise steeply in more areas of north-west England, though rates in Bolton are continuing to fall, new analysis shows. In Rossendale the rate currently stands at 316.2 cases per 100,000 people, up week-on-week from 76.9; in Hyndburn it has risen from 66.6 to 162.9; and in Ribble Valley it is up from 24.6 to 129.7, PA news reports. These areas – all parts of Lancashire – are now recording some of the highest rates in the UK. Blackburn with Darwen, also in Lancashire, remains the area with the highest rate in the country: 416.2, up from 281.2. But while rates in Bolton have fallen week-on-week from 452.1 to 386.0, other areas of Greater Manchester, such as Bury (up from 61.3 to 96.9), Manchester (59.7 to 100.4) and Salford (32.1 to 98.1) are now recording a sharp rise. The latest case rates are for the seven days to May 27, and have been calculated by the PA news agency using Public Health England data. A pensioner, an NHS worker, and a gig economy worker are attempting to bring a legal challenge to the UK government’s charges for hotel quarantine regulations via judicial review. The rules state that UK and Irish citizens and residents who wish to return to England from “red-list” countries must pay an upfront cost of £1,750 to quarantine in a government-designated hotel, and over £3,000 for a family of four. The claimants, who are raising funds via CrowdJustice, argue that the charges breach international law, the World Health Organisation’s international health regulations, as well as equalities and human rights law. There is currently no discretion for people travelling for compassionate or emergency reasons and there is no way for people to pay a reduced fee. The only exemption to upfront payment is a deferred payment plan over a maximum of 12 months which is reserved for people facing emergency financial hardship. Law firm PGMBM has taken the case on a pro bono basis and has instructed barristers Adam Wagner and Cian Murphy of Doughty Street Chambers to challenge the regulations. Taylor Burgess, a senior associate at PGMBM, said: This policy has been ill thought out and has caused a tremendous amount of stress for people. There has been little to no consideration of how this cost will impact people on low incomes. The World Health Organisation’s international health regulations 2005 clearly prohibit charges for quarantine. Our clients believe it is unlawful for the government to operate a policy of charging the same fee of £1,750 to all people who wish to return to England regardless of their individual financial circumstances. One of the people involved in the case, (“Mr M”), is an NHS worker who travelled to Ethiopia in early March to visit his dying uncle and to care for his unwell mother. Shortly after his departure, Ethiopia was added to the “red-list”. He is unable to return to his home and essential role as a key worker as he cannot afford to pay £1,750 to be quarantined. “Mrs B” is a pensioner who travelled to South Africa in October last year to attend her son’s wedding. She was due to arrive home prior to the hotel quarantine regulations coming into force but, after her flight was cancelled, she arrived on 15 February - the day the regulations came into force. Despite receiving a modest pension, Mrs B was asked to pay £1,750 for a hotel quarantine package. The third claimant, (“Mr E”), is a gig economy worker. In early April, Mr E travelled to Pakistan to visit his severely unwell father, who died shortly after Mr E’s arrival. Mr E earns minimum wage and works under a zero-hours contract. To return to England, Mr E was forced to use his family’s emergency savings to pay the upfront fee of £1,750 for his quarantine package. The UK is facing a “quite perilous moment” as the Delta coronavirus variant, first identified in India, takes over, accounting for three-quarters of cases, with no indication yet if the 21 June lifting of restrictions in England will be put on hold. The government’s former chief scientific adviser, Prof Sir Mark Walport, said it was “not impossible” that the country was in the foothills of new wave. “I hope not, but it’s not impossible,” Walport told BBC Breakfast. While the B.1.1.7 variant, or “UK variant”, was disappearing, the B.1.617.2 variant, or India variant, was taking over, he said. The World Health Organization has renamed B.1.1.7 as the Alpha variant, and B.1.617.2 as the Delta variant. Walport said: “It is a quite perilous moment, but we’ve just got to keep our fingers crossed that the measures work.” He added: “It’s clear that the B.1.617.2 variant is taking over – it accounts for about 75% of those cases which have been typed – the numbers of infections are getting up, but we would expect that. “On the much better news side is the fact that hospital admissions are not surging. If anything, overall they’re coming down, though in some parts of the country where the B.1.617 is at its worst they are increasing slightly, so it is genuinely very, very finely balanced.” More data was needed before a final decision could be made about the 21 June easing of restrictions, he said. “We need to substitute speculation for scientific data that’s the truth of the matter, as everyone has said in the last few days, the situation is very delicately balanced with some three sets of moving parts. Read the full story here: An expert advising the Government’s coronavirus response warned that having to reimpose lockdown restrictions would be both worse economically and for public health. Discussing his warning over the June 21 unlocking, Professor Adam Finn, from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: There are a lot of people who are very fed up about the idea of us even worrying about this. Since I’ve been saying in the last 24 hours that we should be cautious I’ve been getting lots of messages from people telling me to shut up basically. But the truth is that a more infectious virus, which is what it looks like we’ve got, will reach people who are vulnerable - those who did not make a good response to the vaccine, those who have not yet had their doses - and that will be a problem for everyone because in the end it will be worse economically as well as for public health if we end up having to shut down again. Asked about whether final restrictions should be eased on June 21, Finn told LBC radio: “I fear it may be a bad decision to go with it.” Asked about the businesses which may not survive further delay, he added: I think they are more likely not to survive if we open up and then shut down again. I’m no business person, and shouldn’t really be commenting on business, but it seems to me that if we can progressively get back to a place where we’re living normally that would be the better thing. But he added that the final decision to unlock lies with politicians, adding: Scientists advise but they don’t decide, and ultimately the politicians have to carry the can for whatever decisions are made. The job of the Covid-19 vaccination programme is not yet “done”, an immunisation expert has said as scientists are split on whether the government should press ahead with the final stages of easing social restrictions later this month. Professor Adam Finn, of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), said there are still many people who are vulnerable to the effects of Covid-19 as he warned “the idea that somehow the job is done is wrong”. Experts are divided over whether the final stage of easing social restrictions should press ahead on June 21 amid a surge in cases of the new variant first identified in India. Finn, from the University of Bristol, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: There’s vulnerability across the country. The idea that somehow the job is done is wrong. We’ve still got a lot of people out there who’ve neither had this virus ... nor yet been immunised, and that’s why we’re in a vulnerable position right now. He told LBC that pressing ahead with the easing of restrictions on June 21 “may be a bad decision”. Professor Ravi Gupta, a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), said a delay of a few weeks could have a significant impact on Britain’s battle against the pandemic and recommended it should be made clear to the public that it would be a temporary measure based on the surge in cases of the new variant. “Even a month delay could have a big impact on the eventual outcome of this,” Gupta told ITV’s Good Morning Britain. However, Robert Dingwall, professor of sociology at Nottingham Trent University, said it was important to press ahead with the June 21 easing from a societal point of view. He told Times Radio: I personally don’t see any case for delay ... from a societal point of view, I think it’s really important that we go ahead on June 21 and I’ve not really seen anything in the data that would lead me to doubt that as a proposition on the evidence to date. I think we need to recognise the way in which levels of fear and anxiety in the population have been amplified over the last 15 months or so. Domino’s Pizza is aiming to hire 5,000 chefs and delivery drivers, as consumers’ appetite for takeaways remains strong, at a time when the hospitality industry is battling staff shortages. Britain’s biggest pizza delivery chain said it had recruited just over 8,000 people in 2020 to meet demand, including hairdressers, taxi drivers and event managers who were not able to work as usual during lockdown. However, as Covid restrictions ease, some of Domino’s pandemic recruits are returning to their previous roles. As a result, the chain needs more staff for its 1,100 UK branches, most of which are run by franchisees. The firm has previously announced plans to open a further 200 outlets. Domino’s search for new employees comes amid warnings from the hospitality industry that it is facing a staffing crisis, with businesses trying to fill thousands of vacancies. Read the full story here: A scientific adviser to the government has repeated calls to delay the June 21 lifting of pandemic restrictions by “a few weeks”, warning that the ability of coronavirus to adapt in the face of vaccines has still left the UK in a vulnerable position. Professor Ravi Gupta, a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), said the UK’s pandemic picture had changed since its road map to recovery was drawn up, chiefly through the emergence of the Indian of B1617.2 strain of the virus, PA news reports. He also warned the increased socialisation following last month’s easing of restrictions could lead to “quite a lot” of hospital admissions, and said while Britain had performed “amazingly well” in its vaccination programme, it was still too early “to put the vaccine straight up against the virus”. Prof Gupta told ITV’s Good Morning Britain moving back the June 21 target date could have a significant impact on the fight against the pandemic, adding it should be made clear to the public this would be a temporary measure based on recent developments. More than 39 million people have been given a first jab and a further 25.3 million have had both doses. Asked whether a three-week delay to the June 21 target would be sufficient while Britons were being vaccinated at a rate of four million per week, he said: Even a month delay could have a big impact on the eventual outcome of this. As long as it’s clear to people this is not an unlimited extension of the lockdown but actually just a reassessment, that would be realistic. Because we didn’t plan for the 617.2 variant when the initial road map was made, and actually things have gone really well except for the fact that we have this new variant to complicate things. We must remember this is a virus that does adapt, and faced with vaccines it will eventually start to make mutations to avoid them even further, and then we could be in an even more precarious situation after that. Gupta said the UK was in “a really good position” in regard to its vaccination programme but caution remained crucial. He said: The key thing here is that we’re almost there. The problem is we don’t want to put the vaccine straight up against the virus at a time when the vaccine coverage isn’t quite high enough; it’s not in young people, it’s not in schoolchildren, and that’s where the virus may potentially start circulating. We still have a lot of vulnerable people in the community who haven’t responded to the vaccine. Gupta said it was concerning that hospital admissions could be about to rise following last month’s easing of restrictions, at a time when hospitals were dealing with large backlogs of procedures and treatments delayed because of the pandemic. He said: If we’re fully unlocked on the 21st of June, we have a situation where over the next few weeks there will be a lot of mixing, there will be gatherings, because people have been waiting to do these things for a long time. So we will get an excess of mixing, especially in younger groups, and that will lead to some hospitalisations... quite a lot, at a time when the NHS is trying to distance within hospitals, so it does take time to get things done there, and the added pressure of having Covid cases, some of which will be severe of course, is going to have an effect on morale and clinical care for everybody. Robert Dingwall, professor of sociology at Nottingham Trent University, said “critics” who have suggested that the June 21 easing should be delayed “can’t even agree on what delay they’d like”. He told Times Radio: By the time we get to June 21, everybody who is in the nine priority groups or the highest risk will have had both jabs, and would have had a period of time to consolidate the immunity. What are we going on with is really running into younger age groups who are intrinsically much lower risk. Many of the scientists who’ve been talking over the weekend simply haven’t adjusted their expectations to understand that - (for these people) Covid is a mild illness in the community. As the Director of Public Health Bolton was saying last week, the people who are going into hospital... it’s not like January, these are not desperately ill people. They’re people who need a little bit of extra support with oxygen, they need access to the dexamethasone treatment, which is very effective. They go in, stay in hospital for three or four days and they go out again. There is no realistic prospect of the NHS facing the sorts of pressures that it faced in January and February. And that’s why I think we have to we have to push on with this. Heathrow has begun processing arrivals from red list countries in a dedicated terminal following concerns about them mixing with other passengers. Travellers arriving from red list nations on direct flights are being taken to Terminal 3. Passengers travelling to the UK on connecting flights from red list locations continue to transit through the airport alongside those from green and amber countries. The red list currently consists of 43 nations from which arrivals are deemed to present a high risk of importing coronavirus. Passengers arriving in the UK after being in one of those destinations during the previous 10 days must spend 11 nights in a quarantine hotel, costing 1,750 for solo travellers. Red list countries from where direct flights to the UK are permitted include India, the Philippines, Pakistan, Kenya and Bangladesh. The decision to separate arrivals on direct flights from red list destinations was welcomed by the GMB union, which had previously warned that “bottlenecks” are putting passengers and staff at risk. Heathrow insisted there were “several layers of protection to keep passengers and colleagues safe”, such as mandatory testing for all arrivals, segregation and ventilation. An airport executive said in April that passengers are being forced to queue for up to six hours to be processed through immigration halls. It is the first time Terminal 3 has been used since April 2020, when it was closed to save costs amid the collapse in demand for travel. Heathrow plans to move its new facility for processing red list arrivals to Terminal 4 “as soon as operationally possible”. Meanwhile, Robert Boyle, former director of strategy at British Airways’ parent company IAG, has predicted that Bahrain, Costa Rica, Trinidad and Tobago, and Kuwait will be added to the red list “shortly” due to rising infection rates. He wrote in a blog post: Given how much heat the government is taking about the delays in adding India to the red list, you might wonder why the four red list candidates haven’t already been added. But ministers are also under heavy pressure to open up travel, not only from beleaguered airlines and other travel companies, but also from parts of the media chafing against what many see as unjustified state restrictions on liberty. Robert Dingwall, professor of sociology at Nottingham Trent University, said that it was important to press ahead with the June 21 easing from a societal point of view. He told Times Radio: I personally, I don’t see any case for delay... from a societal point of view, I think it’s really important that we go ahead on June 21, and I’ve not really seen anything in the data that would lead me to doubt that as a proposition on the evidence to date. I think we need to recognise the way in which levels of fear and anxiety in the population have been amplified over the last 15 months or so. We’ve got to look at the collateral damage in terms of untreated cancers, untreated heart conditions, all of the other things that people suffer from. We’ve got to think about the impact of economic damage that would be caused by further periods of delay and uncertainty. What we see at the moment I think is really a preview of what it means to live with Covid as an endemic infection – these waves will come, they will pass through; there will be high levels of mild infections in the community for periods of time, a handful of people may be seriously ill, even fewer may die. But that’s what happens with respiratory viruses, and we’ve lived with 30-odd respiratory viruses for since forever. Former chief scientific adviser to the government, Professor Sir Mark Walport, said the UK was in a “perilous moment” and potentially on the cusp of a third wave but that more data was needed before the final decision could be made about the June 21 easing of restrictions. He told BBC Breakfast: We need to substitute speculation for scientific data that’s the truth of the matter, as everyone has said in the last few days, the situation is very delicately balanced with some three sets of moving parts. Firstly we have got a new more transmissible variant, of that there is no doubt, though we don’t know exactly how much more transmissible. Secondly, there’s been a change in behaviour following the relaxation of measures on May 17, and the effects of that will just be starting to come through. And thirdly, we’ve got a vaccination programme that is very successful, but with a lot of people that still need both their second dose of vaccine and vaccination from scratch. I’m afraid that weeks before the Prime Minister has to make the difficult decision it is going to be necessary to bring in the data. Asked if the nation is “in the foothills of another wave”, Walport told said he hoped not but that “it’s not impossible”. He said: That’s the reality of it - we have got a new variant and it is taking off, where the B.1.1.7 variant was disappearing. It is a quite perilous moment, but we’ve just got to keep our fingers crossed that the measures work. He added it was clear that the B.1.617.2 variant (also known as the India variant) is “taking over “. He said: It accounts for about 75% of those cases which have been typed - the numbers of infections are getting up, but we would expect that. On the much better news side is the fact that hospital admissions are not surging. If anything, overall they’re coming down, though in some parts of the country where the B.1.617 is at its worst they are increasing slightly, so it is genuinely very, very finely balanced.

Economies are reopening, so the demand for oil is increasing. However, expected oil demand in 2021 is still about five million barrels per day below 2019 levels. During the Covid-19 crisis, OPEC and other major oil producing countries such as Russia absorbed the drop in demand for crude oil by significantly reducing production. This removed 10% of supply from the market.</p> <p>“In recent months production has slowly resumed. There are still over nine million barrels per day of spare capacity though. We expect OPEC will opt for a cautious approach to keep the market in balance. Above all it will be afraid of flooding the market with crude oil too soon. We saw confirmation of this earlier in the year when Saudi Arabia offered to unilaterally cut production by an additional one million barrels per day.

The main indices are all higher as trading resumes after yesterday’s Memorial Day holiday, pushing the S&amp;P 500 index near to record levels. Dow: up 150 points or 0.44% at 34,680 points S&amp;P 500: up 15 points or 0.35% at 4,219 points Nasdaq Composite: up 53 points or 0.4% at 13,802 Oil stocks are sharply higher, following the jump in crude prices today. Devon Energy (+12.2%) and Marathon Oil (+11%) are leading the S&amp;P 500 risers. On the Dow, oil producer Chevron (+2.8%) are the top riser, followed by aerospace manufacturer Boeing (2.8%), investment bank Goldman Sachs (+1.6%) and financial services firm American Express (+1.6%). Corrections corner: I mangled Olaf van den Heuvel’s job title in the Brent crude oil entry earlier. To clarify, he’s CIO Aegon AM NL. Now fixed. Apologies. The jump in crude oil is likely to mean higher energy and transport bills for consumers and businesses, putting upward pressure on inflation. But the good news today, for small firms and organisations, is that they shouldn’t be ripped off by unscrupulous energy brokers. Ofgem, the energy regulator, is forcing brokers to reveal their hidden commission fees, to protect more than a million microbusinesses from being overcharged. My colleague Jillian Ambrose explains: All energy brokers will need to disclose how much commission they stand to earn from their services after some rogue brokers conned charities, church groups and care homes by locking them into long-term bad-value gas and electricity contracts. Ofgem hopes to root out these “poor practices” by forcing brokers to disclose their full commission fees upfront, and by offering microbusiness customers a 14-day cooling-off period after signing a new energy deal. The regulator is setting out the measures almost 18 months after it was made aware that some energy brokers may have overcharged ultra-small companies by up to £2bn by hiding their commission fees. Canada’s economy grew slower than expected in the first quarter of this year, and appears to have contracted in April. Canadian GDP increased by 1.4% during the January-March period, new data shows, down from the 2.2% growth seen in October-December 2020 The economy picked up in March, growing 1.1% after 0.4% growth in February, but is still around 1% smaller than before the pandemic. Statistics Canada says March’s expansion was the 11th consecutive monthly increase, after the steepest drops in Canadian economic activity on record in March and April 2020. But it also estimates that GDP fell in April, by around 0.8%, due to restrictions introduced to restrict the Covid-19 virus. Declines in retail trade and accommodation and food services reflect in part additional public health measures in some parts of the country. There are also notable declines in manufacturing, real estate and rental and leasing, and educational services. US crude price are rallying too, hitting their highest levels since October 2018. Predictions that the oil market is tightening this summer are driving crude prices up, Bloomberg says: U.S. crude futures climbed to the highest in more than two-and-a-half years after the OPEC+ alliance forecast a tightening global market, while international efforts to revive a nuclear deal with Iran were yet to reach a breakthrough. West Texas Intermediate rose as much as 3.2% from Friday’s close to $68.42 a barrel, while global benchmark Brent topped $70, a level it has failed to hold for a sustained period since 2019. The oil glut built up during the coronavirus pandemic has almost gone and stockpiles will slide rapidly in the second half of the year, according to an assessment of the market from an OPEC+ committee. A ministerial group is gathering in Vienna, before a full meeting that is expected to ratify a scheduled output increase for July. Brent crude has hit its highest level in almost three months, as oil ministers from Opec countries and their allies prepare to decide whether to lift production. Brent is up over 2% today, hitting $71 per barrel for the first time since early March. The Opec+ group, led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, are expected to stick to their plan of gradually relaxing supply curbs, as they await to see whether Iran’s production increases (if a nuclear deal with the US is agreed). Factory data from China earlier today, showing the fastest growth this year, is also positive for oil demand, as are the record manufacturing PMI readings from the eurozone and UK this morning. Olaf van den Heuvel, CIO at Aegon AM NL, expects OPEC will attempt to stabilise oil prices as spare capacity responds to rising demand, rather than boost supply too fast and risk another price war. “Commodity prices are in the spotlight because of rising inflation. Economies are reopening, so the demand for oil is increasing. However, expected oil demand in 2021 is still about five million barrels per day below 2019 levels. During the Covid-19 crisis, OPEC and other major oil producing countries such as Russia absorbed the drop in demand for crude oil by significantly reducing production. This removed 10% of supply from the market. “In recent months production has slowly resumed. There are still over nine million barrels per day of spare capacity though. We expect OPEC will opt for a cautious approach to keep the market in balance. Above all it will be afraid of flooding the market with crude oil too soon. We saw confirmation of this earlier in the year when Saudi Arabia offered to unilaterally cut production by an additional one million barrels per day. That being said, in April it decided to increase production by 2.1 million barrels per day from May to July in anticipation of a pick-up in global economic growth. “It will remain cautious however, thanks to other areas where supply could yet rebound beyond its control. This includes Iran, which is currently producing two million barrels of oil per day but could reach toward 6.5 million if a new nuclear deal is agreed with the US. The US itself could also up its capacity as prices rise and shale oil producers come back into play. OPEC will be wary of restarting a price war with those producers that ended so badly for them in 2014 and 2015. The pound has now dropped back from its earlier three-year high against the US dollar. Having hit $1.4250 early this morning, sterling has now dipped to $1.4175, down a third of a cent. Reuters attributes this dip to profit-taking, and some concerns that the UK’s reopening plans could be disrupted by the latest Covid-19 strain, now known as the Delta variant. “We saw some profit taking appear this morning as the market looked to monetize the gains made overnight,” said Stuart Cole, head macro economist at Equiti Capital. Cole added that fears that a COVID variant, first found in India, could delay the next phase of the reopening on June 21 also capped sterling’s gains. Inflation fears kept the overnight optimism in check after Bank of England Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden said the central bank is carefully monitoring Britain’s booming housing market. The government’s former chief scientific adviser, Prof Sir Mark Walport, warned today that the UK is facing a “quite perilous moment” as the Delta coronavirus variant becomes more dominant, accounting for three-quarters of cases. Back in UK manufacturing, the firm behind Jammie Dodgers, Wagon Wheels and Maryland Cookies has been sold. Burton’s Biscuits is being acquired by the Ferrero Group (whose Ferrero Rocher adverts at the ambassador’s reception are still fondly remembered here). Burton’s employs around 2,000 people at six production facilities at Blackpool, Dorset, Edinburgh, Livingston, Llantarnam and Isle of Arran, and dates back to 1935. Headquartered in St. Albans, is being sold by the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board after eight years. Ferrero, which also makes Nutella and Kinder chocolates, says the deal will expand its sweet biscuits offering, having previously acquired Biscuits Delacre, Kelsen Group and Fox’s. Nick Jansa, senior managing director at Ontario Teachers’ , says Burton’s is ‘well positioned’ for success: “We’re proud to have supported Burton’s and overseen the significant growth of this leading UK biscuit manufacturer. Since our investment, Burton’s has implemented key organic growth initiatives and completed a number of strategic acquisitions to further strengthen its portfolio and manufacturing capability. Eurozone inflation is now (just) above target for the first time since October 2018. Charles Hepworth, investment director at GAM Investments, says the European Central Bank should welcome this move (it’s been trying stimulate prices and ward of deflation). Consumers probably won’t share this feeling, but Hepworth doesn’t think higher inflation will be permanent. The resurgent demand coming about from partial reopening of the bloc’s economy highlights the ongoing supply constraints in some parts of the economy. The ECB however will be more than pleased that inflation is at its implied target level, although how long it persists is open to huge debate, as witnessed in volatility seen across markets since the spectre of higher inflation emerged this year. Higher input costs will inevitably lead to a modest inflation overshoot in the short term but the continuation of monetary largesse, which doesn’t seem to be looking to be withdrawn any time soon, is arguably the deciding factor on the medium-term inflation rate. We see higher inflation as being a transient one-off supply led issue and not something that should spook investors in the medium term. Inflation across the eurozone has accelerated above the European Central Bank’s target, as rising prices hit consumers. The annual eurozone consumer prices index rose by 2% in May, flash data shows, up from 1.6% in April. Energy prices were the biggest factor, surging by 13.1% over the last year (as crude prices recover from their slump early in the pandemic). Service sector firms also raised their prices, with annual services inflation rising to 1.1% from 0.9% in April, while non-energy industrial goods rose 0.7% and food, alcohol &amp; tobacco were 0.6% higher than a year ago. This takes inflation above the ECB’s inflation target of ‘close to, but below 2%’, and could intensify pressure from more hawkish policymakers to slow its pandemic bond-buying stimulus programme. Eurostat has also reported that unemployment across the eurozone fell in April, to 8.0% from 8.1% in March. However, that’s still higher than a year ago (it was 7.3% in April 2020), due to the heavy job losses caused by Covid-19. That shows that the economic damage of the pandemic has yet to heal (especially with the eurozone falling into recession last quarter). It adds: Eurostat estimates that 15.380 million men and women in the EU, of whom 13.030 million in the euro area, were unemployed in April 2021. Compared with March 2021, the number of persons unemployed decreased by 165 000 in the EU and by 134 000 in the euro area. Compared with April 2020, unemployment rose by 1.406 million in the EU and by 1.275 million in the euro area. UK factories might growing even faster if they weren’t constrained by supply chain problems, says Mike Thornton, partner and head of manufacturing at accountancy giant RSM. He says supply shortages are now biting, as firms consume stocks built up ahead of the Brexit deadline at the end of 2020. ‘It’s great to see another increase in the latest CIPS Manufacturing PMI to a record high of 65.6 from 60.9; and reinforces the important role that UK manufacturing will play in the economic recovery this year. ‘It also demonstrates the resilience of manufacturers in a chaotic market; but supply chain disruption is really starting to bite now. Not only is there a shortage of certain components which is stalling production, but the cost of shipping certain products or materials is through the roof. This extra expense is the last thing manufacturers need as they try to trade out of unprecedented times. ‘Brexit stockpiling has cushioned the blow for many manufacturers at the start of the year; but as stocks dwindle and supply chain disruption remains, we could see further pressure on input costs and production – pushing prices up even further for consumers. ‘It’s such a shame that post-Brexit and pandemic supply chain disruption could curb economic growth at a time when manufacturers are looking to maximise the opportunity of pent up consumer spend.’ The Office for National Statistics has reported that the number of companies citing Brexit as their main challenge rose at the start of the year – replacing Covid-19 as the biggest problem for the largest proportion of firms. Here’s a good snap summary of the purchasing manager survey, from EY Item Club’s Howard Archer: By surging to 65.6 in May, the UK manufacturing PMI has burst above July 1994’s previous record high of 61.0, as well as April’s reading of 60.9. It’s now signalled an improvement in the factory sector for the last 12 months, following the first lockdown in April and May 2020. A surge of new orders has helped Britain’s factory sector to post a record increase in activity last month, as the easing of lockdown restrictions boosted demand. The UK Manufacturing PMI jumped to 65.6 in May, up from 60.9 in April, and the highest since the survey began in 1992 (any reading over 50 shows growth). IHS Markit, which compiles the survey, reports that conditions in the manufacturing sector improved at an unprecedented rate in May. Output growth strengthened, and new orders rose at the quickest pace on record. Markit says: Companies linked new order growth to rising business confidence, the further re-opening of the UK economy and reduced issues relating to COVID-19. New export orders also rose at a survey-record pace in May, amid reports of stronger demand from the EU, the US and China. But while large companies saw record gains in new export work, small firms only saw a smaller rise. Employment jumped at a record pace, with manufacturers taking on staff to handle high levels of pent-up demand. Supply disruption was a growing problem too, with companies reporting shortages of electronics, plastics and metals, transport delays and higher demand for raw materials. This drove up input costs at a record pace, leading to an unprecedented rise in output prices too, in a further sign that inflationary pressures are building. Rob Dobson, Director at IHS Markit, said UK factories benefitted from the easing of lockdown restrictions, as vaccine rollouts help economies unlock. But he also warns that consumers will see higher prices, as the jump in input costs is passed on. “The UK PMI surged to an unprecedented high in May, as record growth of new orders and employment supported one of the steepest increases in production volumes in the near 30-year survey history. Growth is being boosted by the unlocking of economies from COVID restrictions and ongoing vaccination programs. This is being felt across the globe, as highlighted by a record rise in new export business during the latest survey month. The corollaries of this strong upsurge in industrial activity are increased strain on supply chains and a build-up of price pressures. Supplies of inputs into manufacturers and finished goods on to clients are both being severely disrupted by raw material shortages, port issues, COVID restrictions, post-Brexit difficulties and market forces as demand outstrips supply. Suppliers’ delivery times subsequently lengthened to one of the greatest extents on record, while input costs and selling prices both rose at unprecedented rates. With little sign of supply pressures receding, these price rises will become more visible to consumers.” Back on the housing market boom... the Resolution Foundation flags up that prices are rising fastest in the less populated parts of the UK, confirming that the ‘race for space’ is happening. Resolution’s research, released last month, found that house prices in the least-densely populated areas of the UK have risen almost twice as much as those in the most-densely populated areas over the past year. Demand for rural properties, or those with a garden, have jumped during the lockdown and the move to more home working. Domino’s Pizza is aiming to hire 5,000 chefs and delivery drivers, as consumers’ appetite for takeaways remains strong, at a time when the hospitality industry is battling staff shortages. Britain’s biggest pizza delivery chain said it had recruited just over 8,000 people in 2020 to meet demand, including hairdressers, taxi drivers and event managers who were not able to work as usual during lockdown. However, as Covid restrictions ease, some of Domino’s pandemic recruits are returning to their previous roles. As a result, the chain needs more staff for its 1,100 UK branches, most of which are run by franchisees. The firm has previously announced plans to open a further 200 outlets. Domino’s search for new employees comes amid warnings from the hospitality industry that it is facing a staffing crisis, with businesses trying to fill thousands of vacancies. Domino’s was “overwhelmed by the response from people of all walks of life” during last year’s recruitment drive, said Nicola Frampton, operations director at Domino’s UK. Frampton added. “I’m proud we were able to play a part by offering people the opportunity to continue working and earning when times were tough. But as people start to reunite, customer demand is showing no signs of slowing and so we’re now looking for 5,000 new recruits.” Here’s the full story: UK sub-prime lender Amigo is facing insolvency after the UK high court rejected a controversial rescue plan last week. Amigo told the City this morning that it will not appeal the court’s ruling, which concluded that its proposal to cut compensation payouts to customers for mis-selling loans was unfair. Amigo added that its board are considering all options, including insolvency, saying: The Board of Amigo continues to consider all options, which includes insolvency, and whether it might be possible and appropriate, given the cost of a scheme, to promote another scheme of arrangement to avoid insolvency. The UK’s financial watchdog, the FCA, opposed the original scheme of arrangement proposed by Amigo, which charges 49.9% interest and requires borrowers to provide a friend or family member to act as a guarantor for a loan. Under the plan, the compensation pool for those missold loans was capped while directors could earn £7m in long-term bonuses. Gary Jennison, chief executive officer of Amigo, said today: “Without a scheme, Amigo faces insolvency as it will be unable to satisfy its customer compensation claims as well as meeting the legally binding funding obligations owed to its secured creditors. The Board is committed to finding the best solution it can for Amigo’s customers and other stakeholders and will be working with its stakeholders, including the FCA, to achieve that solution as quickly as it can.” Amigo shares are down 8% this morning at around 7.6p, near to its record lows, having halved last week after the court ruling. It floated on the stock market in 2018 at 275p... The FTSE 100 index has jumped 1% this morning, amid hopes of a strong recovery from the pandemic. The blue-chip FTSE 100 index is currently up 75 points to 7097 points, near to the pandemic highs hit last month, with almost every stock gaining ground. Mining companies are leading the risers, with iron ore jumping today amid reports that China could be relaxing recent restrictions on steelmakers in its Tangshan region. The weaker dollar is also pushing up commodity prices, boosting Anglo American (+4.5%), Rio Tinto (+4%), Glencore (+3.4%) and BHP Group (+3.4%). Housebuilders such as Persimmon (+2.4%), Barratt Development (+1.7%) and Taylor Wimpey (+1.2%) are also rallying, after Nationwide reported that house prices jumped sharply again in May. AJ Bell financial analyst Danni Hewson says: “Robust figures from the housing market lifted the housebuilding sector while miners were in demand as commodity prices resumed an upwards trajectory. “The FTSE’s rise was all the more impressive when you consider it came against the backdrop of a recovery-inspired rally in sterling. A strong pound dulls the relative worth of the overseas earnings which dominate the index. Europe’s Stoxx 600 share index has hit a new record high this morning, rising by over 0.8% to 450.79 points. The eurozone manufacturing PMI has hit a new record high, as factory activity surged and inflationary pressures build up. Data firm IHS Markit has reported that its eurozone manufacturing purchasing manager’s index, which tracks activity across the sector, hit 63.1 in May, up from April’s 62.9. That’s its highest reading since the survey began in 1997 (any reading over 50 shows growth). Firms reported a slight slowdown in output and new orders, but growth rates remained near the record levels set earlier this year. There was also a record deterioration in vendor delivery times, as suppliers struggled to meet demand, which pushed up raw materials costs and forced companies to hike their own prices. Markit says: On the price front, average input costs again rose substantially, with the rate of inflation hitting an unprecedented level in line with widespread product shortages. Boosted by strong market demand, manufacturers took advantage of improved pricing power by raising their own charges at the fastest rate in more than 18 years of data availability. Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit, says the data suggests the eurozone will grow strongly this summer, and also see a sharp rise in inflation: “Eurozone manufacturing continues to grow at a rate unprecedented in almost 24 years of survey history, the PMI breaking new records for a third month in a row. Surging output growth adds to signs that the economy is rebounding strongly in the second quarter. “However, May also saw record supply delays, which are constraining output growth and leaving firms unable to meet demand to a degree not previously witnessed by the survey In the financial markets, sterling has hit its highest level against the US dollar in three years. The pound traded as high as $1.4248 early this morning, its highest level since April 2018 (which was the highest since the 2016 EU referendum). This rally comes despite concerns about a potential third wave of Covid-19, due to rising cases of the new variant, called B.1.617.2, Bloomberg reports that traders are betting that the UK’s fast vaccine rollout will help the recovery gain traction: “The pound is favored because the progress of vaccination puts the U.K. closer to economic normalization than other countries,” said Toshiya Yamauchi, chief manager for foreign-exchange margin trading at Ueda Harlow Ltd. in Tokyo. “Sterling could climb toward $1.45.” Economic optimism has also lifted sterling recently, with consumer confidence strengthening, retail sales rising and company output picking up as lockdown restrictions were eased. Yesterday, the OECD predicted that the UK economy would expand by 7.2% this year, a strong bounceback, which would be the fastest since 1941. The dollar, though, has been pushed down by the huge US stimulus spending packages and the Federal Reserve’s pledge not to tighten monetary policy until it sees more progress on unemployment. Last week it hit a three-year low against China’s yuan, despite Beijing’s efforts to avoid its currency strengthening too quickly (which could hit export growth). The shortage of larger, more rural houses on the market is helping to push up prices strongly, says Nicky Stevenson, managing director at national estate agent group Fine &amp; Country.: “Many current buyers are those who delayed a move last year and would have been forgiven for thinking that competition would have cooled by now. Instead, they find themselves in an even tighter race as demand continues to outstrip supply. The buyers driving the market higher are still those looking for more space. Forever homes are still the order of the day and buyers are more than willing to do everything in their power to secure what they truly desire. “There just aren’t enough of these larger properties coming onto the market in the right areas and there’s no sign this imbalance is going to resolve itself in time to suppress strong growth over the summer.” But Guy Harrington, CEO of residential lender Glenhawk, predicts that the pace of growth will slow, especially if a third wave of Covid-19 cases hits the UK. “The disconnect between the UK housing market and economic reality appears as great as ever. Government stimulus has created a false sense of consumer confidence. Iain McKenzie, CEO of The Guild of Property Professionals, says there’s a ‘frenzy’ in the housing market, with some buyers bolstered by lockdown savings: “At a time when much of the country seems to be enjoying a sense of normality once again, we would expect the property market to follow suit. Today’s figures show that the market didn’t get the memo. The frenzy to snap up a property at the tail end of a pandemic is showing no signs of stopping, with double digit growth in house prices throughout May - the highest we have seen in the best part of a decade. “The success of the stamp duty holiday has certainly played its part, as well as the savings many have made while working from home. “With a record-breaking new average house price, which has grown almost £24,000 over the past 12 months, it’s worth thinking about how your potential savings might not outweigh the inflated price of your new home. “It is still crucial that prospective buyers go into the process with a sound understanding of the market and what they want from a new property. “As demand in the market increases, the extra competition creates a fear of missing out that can distract buyers from the fundamentals. It’s important not to let the current property frenzy draw attention away from what you are really looking for.” Nationwide also predicts that house prices could “accelerate further” in the coming months. The ‘race for space’, record low interest rates, and the stamp duty holiday (which will fall from £500,000 to £250,000 at the end of June, and finish three months later) could all drive activity, making it even harder for first-time buyers to get onto the housing ladder. But the market could then slow, if the end of the furlough scheme pushed up unemployment. Chief economist Robert Gardner explains: “Housing market activity is likely to remain fairly buoyant over the next six months as a result of the stamp duty extension and additional support for the labour market included in the Budget, especially given continued low borrowing costs, improving credit availability and with many people still motivated to move as a result of changing housing preferences in the wake of the pandemic. “With the stock of homes on the market constrained, there is scope for annual house price growth to accelerate further in the coming months, especially given the low base for comparison in early summer last year. Further ahead, the outlook for the market is far more uncertain. If unemployment rises sharply towards the end of the year as most analysts expect, there is scope for activity to slow, perhaps sharply, though even this could potentially be offset by ongoing shifts in housing preferences, if current trends are maintained. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The UK housing boom continues to run, with house price inflation accelerating again as the pandemic spurs people to move to larger properties in more rural areas. Figures released by Nationwide this morning show that annual house price growth jumped to 10.9% in May, up from 7.1%/year in April, pushing the new average price to a new peak. It says: Annual house price growth rises to 10.9%, the highest level in nearly seven years Prices up 1.8% month-on-month, following a 2.3% rise in April New record average price of £242,832, up £23,930 over the past twelve months Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist, says the housing market has seen a “complete turnaround over the past twelve months” since the first lockdown temporarily froze the market, with transactions reaching a record high of 183,000 in March: Gardner adds that Nationwide’s research shows that pressure for more space, or a garden, is the primary factor driving the market this spring. “Amongst homeowners surveyed at the end of April that were either moving home or considering a move, more than two thirds (68%) said this would have been the case even if the stamp duty holiday had not been extended. It is shifting housing preferences which is continuing to drive activity, with people reassessing their needs in the wake of the pandemic. Nationwide says the ‘race for space’ continues to drive demand. Of those moving or considering a move, around a third (33%) were looking to move to a different area, while nearly 30% were doing so to access a garden or outdoor space more easily, according to an online survey of consumers. Gardner adds: “Over a third (36%) of those surveyed said they were more likely to consider enhancing their home as a result of Covid19, with nearly half (46%) of these looking to add or maximise space. Faster broadband was another factor, with the move to home working and home schooling during lockdown showing the value of a good web connection. Nationwide’s results will interest the Bank of England, which is carefully monitoring Britain’s booming housing market as it weighs up the possibility that a rapid recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic will lead to a sustained period of inflation. In an interview with the Guardian today, deputy governor Sir Dave Ramsden said the Bank expected price pressures to be temporary but he and his colleagues on Threadneedle Street’s monetary policy committee were aware of the risks. Ramsden, the deputy governor responsible for markets and banking, said: “There is a risk that demand gets ahead of supply and that will lead to a more generalised pick-up in inflationary pressure. That’s something we are absolutely going to guard against. We are looking carefully at the housing market and a raft of real-term indicators.” Also coming up today Surveys of factory purchasing managers in the eurozone, UK and US are expected to show strong growth last month, and squeezed supply chains pushing up prices. Oil ministers from the Opec+ group will hold a video call today to assess the latest developments in the global markets. They’re expected to stick to the existing pace of gradually easing oil supply curbs, as demand picks up -- which has already pushed UK petrol prices up for six months in a row. Crude prices have risen overnight, with Brent crude rising over $70 per barrel.

Joe Biden will travel today to Tulsa, Oklahoma, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the city’s race massacre, which targeted affluent African Americans and their businesses. Ahead of the president’s trip, the White House announced this morning a series of new initiatives aimed at narrowing the country’s racial wealth gap. The administration pledged to take action to address racial housing discrimination and use its purchasing power to direct an additional $100 Billion to small disadvantaged business owners. The trip and the administration’s announcement come two weeks after three living survivors of the massacre -- Viola Fletcher, Hughes Van Ellis and Lessie Evelyn Benningfield Randle -- testified to Congress about the need to compensate massacre survivors and their descendants. “I am here seeking justice,” Fletcher said at the House subcommittee hearing. “I am here asking my country to acknowledge what happened in Tulsa in 1921.” The blog will have more details on the trip coming up, so stay tuned.","charCount":"4205","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/joan-greve\">Joan E Greve</a> in Washington"},{"headline":"Boris Johnson says no evidence to delay England reopening","standfirst":"<p>Scientists say UK faces ‘perilous moment’ as Delta Covid variant now makes up 75% of cases<br></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus – latest updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul>","trailText":"Scientists say UK faces ‘perilous moment’ as Delta Covid variant now makes up 75% of cases<br>","byline":"Jessica Elgot and Caroline Davies","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e70a605dc5ca44fffa9465165905ad41ed9acfdc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e70a605dc5ca44fffa9465165905ad41ed9acfdc/0_1_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People enjoy the sun by the lake in Regent’s Park in London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People enjoy the sun by the lake in Regent’s Park in London on Monday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jo Hale/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Boris Johnson stands by his comments that there is nothing in the data to suggest a deviation from England’s reopening on 21 June, Downing Street has said, as scientists said the UK was facing a perilous moment.</p> <p>The business minister Paul Scully also said on Tuesday there was “cautious optimism” that the date for the final lifting of restrictions could go ahead as planned. He told Times Radio the government did not want to have to roll back restrictions again.</p> <p>“One thing that we saw last year, before Christmas, was the stop-start nature just didn’t work for businesses and cost them more. So we’ve got to get it absolutely right. People’s jobs and livelihoods depend on it.”</p> <p>However, the government’s former chief scientific adviser, Prof Sir Mark Walport, said it was “not impossible” that the country was in the foothills of a new wave, as the Delta coronavirus variant, first identified in India, takes over, accounting for three-quarters of cases.</p> <p>“I hope not, but it’s not impossible,” Walport told BBC Breakfast. While the B.1.1.7 variant, or “UK variant”, was disappearing, the B.1.617.2 variant, or India variant, was taking over, he said. The World Health Organization has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/01/covid-19-variants-to-be-given-greek-alphabet-names-to-avoid-stigma\">renamed</a> B.1.1.7 as the Alpha variant, and B.1.617.2 as the Delta variant.</p> <p>Walport said: “It is a quite perilous moment, but we’ve just got to keep our fingers crossed that the measures work.” He added: “It’s clear that the B.1.617.2 variant is taking over – it accounts for about 75% of those cases which have been typed – the numbers of infections are getting up, but we would expect that.”</p> <p>Asked about the prime minister’s view on the latest data, a No 10 spokesman said: “I was going to point to what the PM said on Thursday. The prime minister has said on a number of occasions that we haven’t seen anything in the data but we will continue to look at the data, we will continue to look at the latest scientific evidence as we move through June towards 21 Jun.”</p> <p>In north-west England, which contains a number of Covid hotspots, the seven-day average for new daily hospital admissions has risen to 23 patients, up from 13 two weeks previously. In other regions, admissions continued to fall or rose slightly.</p> <p>Last Thursday, Johnson said “I don’t see anything currently in the data” that would lead to any deviation from the current roadmap.</p> <p>A number of Conservative MPs opposed to further restrictions have fired warning shots at the suggestion the roadmap be delayed. The former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said the prime minister must resist “an organised push by a group of scientists to stop June 21”.</p> <p>“There is no actual fact that says we shouldn’t unlock on the 21st,” he said. “We were always told that the most important feature of all of this is to protect the most vulnerable.

The business minister Paul Scully also said on Tuesday there was “cautious optimism” that the date for the final lifting of restrictions could go ahead as planned. He told Times Radio the government did not want to have to roll back restrictions again. “One thing that we saw last year, before Christmas, was the stop-start nature just didn’t work for businesses and cost them more. So we’ve got to get it absolutely right. People’s jobs and livelihoods depend on it.” However, the government’s former chief scientific adviser, Prof Sir Mark Walport, said it was “not impossible” that the country was in the foothills of a new wave, as the Delta coronavirus variant, first identified in India, takes over, accounting for three-quarters of cases. “I hope not, but it’s not impossible,” Walport told BBC Breakfast. While the B.1.1.7 variant, or “UK variant”, was disappearing, the B.1.617.2 variant, or India variant, was taking over, he said. The World Health Organization has renamed B.1.1.7 as the Alpha variant, and B.1.617.2 as the Delta variant. Walport said: “It is a quite perilous moment, but we’ve just got to keep our fingers crossed that the measures work.” He added: “It’s clear that the B.1.617.2 variant is taking over – it accounts for about 75% of those cases which have been typed – the numbers of infections are getting up, but we would expect that.” Asked about the prime minister’s view on the latest data, a No 10 spokesman said: “I was going to point to what the PM said on Thursday. The prime minister has said on a number of occasions that we haven’t seen anything in the data but we will continue to look at the data, we will continue to look at the latest scientific evidence as we move through June towards 21 Jun.” In north-west England, which contains a number of Covid hotspots, the seven-day average for new daily hospital admissions has risen to 23 patients, up from 13 two weeks previously. In other regions, admissions continued to fall or rose slightly. Last Thursday, Johnson said “I don’t see anything currently in the data” that would lead to any deviation from the current roadmap. A number of Conservative MPs opposed to further restrictions have fired warning shots at the suggestion the roadmap be delayed. The former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said the prime minister must resist “an organised push by a group of scientists to stop June 21”. “There is no actual fact that says we shouldn’t unlock on the 21st,” he said. “We were always told that the most important feature of all of this is to protect the most vulnerable. We have now double-dosed pretty near 50% of the population and that encompasses all the most vulnerable.” Mark Harper, the chair of the Covid Recovery Group of lockdown-sceptic Tory MPs, said there should be no reason not to “open up fully” on 21 June if vaccinations worked as well as had been reported. Walport said the decision was “finely balanced” because hospital admissions were so far not surging. More data was needed before a final decision could be made about the 21 June easing of restrictions, he said. “Firstly we have got a new more transmissible variant, of that there is no doubt, though we don’t know exactly how much more transmissible. Secondly, there’s been a change in behaviour following the relaxation of measures on 17 May, and the effects of that will just be starting to come through. “And thirdly, we’ve got a vaccination programme that is very successful, but with a lot of people that still need both their second dose of vaccine and vaccination from scratch. I’m afraid that weeks before the prime minister has to make the difficult decision it is going to be necessary to bring in the data.” Scully said the government would make a judgment based on the most recent data. ‘This isn’t a fudge.

They can be many things: columns, tombs, plaques, cenotaphs, village halls, even housing. But who are they for? The people who suffered, their families, the wider public or future generations?</p> <p>At some point, inevitably, there will be an official, national memorial of the pandemic in the UK (as well as many more, surely, at local and international levels). What, then, should it look like? It will have to contend with how messy the past year has been – the death, the sorrow, the fear, but also the ensuing political and social division. Perhaps through all of that, memorialisation can play a therapeutic role.</p> <p>Memorials naturally remove some of the complexity of the past, replacing it with something smoother, better suited to a broad audience: the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/from-the-archive-blog/2020/nov/10/the-funeral-of-the-unknown-warrior-november-920\">tomb of the Unknown Warrior</a> doesn’t address one specific loss, so it can talk of all loss. Because of this universal ambition it is vital public memorials hit the right tone – being both honest and broadly interpretable, tending to avoid friction. As a result, though, memorials can feel as if they don’t talk to you directly or seem too vague. But at a time when narratives are brutally contested, it seems unlikely that a pandemic memorial will avoid controversy, no matter how skilful the architect.</p> <p><strong>Read more here: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/01/what-should-britains-memorial-covid-pandemic-look-like\">Eddie Blake – What should Britain’s memorial to the Covid pandemic look like?</a></strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/01/what-should-britains-memorial-covid-pandemic-look-like\">What should Britain’s memorial to the Covid pandemic look like? | Eddie Blake</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60b5d8288f088d8c3178f3a9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-01T06:49:42.786Z\">7.49am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Prof Adam Finn, from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, is a second expert in the UK on the airwaves today warning against further easing of domestic restrictions on 21 June.

workers in Huthi-held territory in Yemen will be given vaccinations from next week, a World Health Organization official told Reuters. Adham Abdel-Moneim, the WHO’s representative in Yemen, said 10,000 doses arrived in the capital Sanaa yesterday and were put in cold storage. The WHO will run the campaign. Human Rights Watch on Tuesday accused the Huthi rebels of concealing the number of Covid-19 cases in areas it controls and blocking the delivery of vaccines, despite the country receiving 360,000 doses on 31 March. Vaccinations began almost two months ago in parts of Yemen controlled by the Saudi-backed government. Doctors marched throughout India to protest a popular guru who claimed yoga can defeat Covid-19, AFP reports. The doctors denounced and called for the arrest for Baba Ramdev, who claimed modern drugs were “stupid and failed science”. The doctors’ association at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), one of Delhi’s biggest government hospitals, called Ramdev’s comments “disgraceful”. Ramdev, a keen supporter of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, retracted his comments after an appeal by India’s health minister and the guru said he had been merely reading out other people’s WhatsApp messages. But he then caused further outcry by saying that he did not need a coronavirus vaccine because he was protected by yoga and traditional medicine, or Ayurveda. Moderna has followed Pfizer by filing for full approval of its coronavirus vaccine in the US, which is currently authorised for emergency use, Reuters reports. The company said it will be submitting data to the US Food and Drug Administration over coming weeks as it seeks priority approval for the vaccine. Scarce supplies of coronavirus vaccines are endangering refugees in Asia as their host countries experience surges in Covid-19 cases, the UN’s refugee agency, UNHCR, has warned. It urged manufacturers and countries with surplus vaccines to give more vaccines to Covax. Low supplies to the global vaccine-sharing initiative has meant delayed deliveries to countries relying on it. “These countries host the vast majority of more than 80 million forcibly displaced people in the world. Yet so far, they have benefited from only a fraction of the world’s Covid-19 vaccines,” UNHCR said on Tuesday. Not a single vaccine has been delivered in the Rohingya refugees camps in Bangladesh, where the total number of cases identified more than doubled in May alone. There were also increased among refugee populations in Nepal, Pakistan, Thailand, Malaysia, Iran and Indonesia, UNHCR said. Reuters are reporting that Poland will offer Covid-19 vaccinations to children aged 12-15 from 7 June. Michal Dworczyk, the minister in charge of the country’s vaccination programme, announced the move this morning. The European Commission on Friday authorized the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine for use in children as young as 12. The Italian government has allocated €50m to help treat the estimated 164,000 people suffering from serious health problems associated with ‘long Covid’. The money will be used for regular check-ups, including of the heart, lungs and kidneys, of patients until the end of 2023 as part of a strategy also aimed at allowing medics to research the long-term impact of the virus. More than a third of Italians suffering from serious symptoms of long-Covid are from Lombardy, the region hardest-hit by the pandemic. Antonio Pisani, a neurologist at the Mondino research centre, told Il Sole 24 Ore that the risk of neurological disorders is high. Among the most common symptoms he sees among patients are ongoing fatigue, dizziness and difficulty concentrating. He said there were also signs that the virus could predispose people to diseases including Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s. “I had two patients who, before March 2020, had never visited a neurologis … a month ago one was diagnosed with Parkinson’s and the other Alzheimer’s. Therefore it’s as if Covid was an accelerator for a disease that was already there but had not yet presented itself.” Delivery to the Philippines of the first batches of a promised 17m doses of AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine made in Thailand has been delayed by several weeks, a Philippine presidential adviser has said. The delay raises questions about AstraZeneca’s vaccine distribution plan in Southeast Asia, which depend on 200m doses made by Siam Bioscience, a company owned by Thailand’s king that is making vaccines for the first time. Joey Concepcion, a presidential adviser who has been coordinating vaccine procurement with the Philippine government and private sector, told Reuters that AstraZeneca had informed him delivery of the first batch of 1.3m doses would have to be pushed back from the third week of June to mid-July and also reduced to 1.17m doses. Concepcion said he was in touch daily with AstraZeneca and was told there were delays in Thai production. “It is a new plant they are running … that is how it is when you start a new plant,” he said. AstraZeneca has faced legal action in Europe over a failure to deliver supplies as promised. Yemen’s Huthi rebels, who control most of the country’s north including the capital Sanaa, have been blocking international efforts to supply Covid vaccines, Human Rights Watch said. The New York-based group accused Huthi leaders of suppressing information about both the dangers of Covid and the prevalence of the disease in territory under their control. “The deliberate decision of the Huthi authorities to keep the real number of cases of Covid-19 under wraps and their opposition to vaccines are putting Yemeni lives at risk,” said HRW’s deputy Middle East director Michael Page. “Pretending Covid-19 does not exist is not a mitigation strategy and will only lead to mass suffering. “Given the weakened healthcare system in Yemen, Huthi authorities should at least ensure transparency so that civilians living in their areas can understand the scale of the pandemic and facilitate an international vaccination plan that meets the needs on the ground.” AFP report that Yemen received 360,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine on 31 March, the first of 1.9 million doses to be delivered this year through the Covax programme for poorer countries. However, the rebels’ failure to cooperate with the World Health Organization and the Yemeni government has prevented any vaccines from reaching the north, HRW said citing a medical source with “direct knowledge of the circumstances”. As a result, vaccinations have only been occurring in the government-held south. HRW quoted Huthi officials as dismissing Covid-19 as a “conspiracy”. “America bears the primary responsibility for the Covid-19 epidemic,” it quoted rebel leader Abdul Malik al-Huthi, as saying in a televised speech last year. Heathrow airport in London has begun processing arrivals from red list countries in a dedicated terminal following concerns about them mixing with other passengers. Travellers arriving from red list nations on direct flights are being taken to Terminal 3. Russia has announced the resumption of air travel with Britain and a number of other countries – Austria, Hungary, Lebanon, Luxembourg, Croatia, Mauritius, and Morocco – which had been suspended due to coronavirus restrictions. Peru has revised its official Covid-19 death toll to 180,764, nearly triple the previous official figure of 69,342, following a government review that shows the severity of the outbreak in the country. The World Health Organisation has recommended a new set of names for the coronavirus “variants of concern”, which will be known by letters of the Greek alphabet. Alpha is the new name for UK/Kent (B.1.1.7), Beta for South Africa (B.1.351), Gamma for Brazil (P.1) and Delta for the variant first detected in India (B.1.617.2). Chinese authorities in Guangdong province have cancelled flights and locked down communities in response to what is believed to be the first community outbreak of the “Delta” or Indian variant in China. Malaysia has begun a tough nationwide lockdown to battle a worsening coronavirus outbreak. Of almost 2,800 deaths from Covid-19 recorded in the country of 32 million since the start of the pandemic, over 40 percent were in May alone. Taiwan has reported 13 new deaths from Covid-19, and 262 new cases. In a sign that authorities are also clearing the backlog of test results which had seen hundreds added to previous daily totals and caused difficulties in analysing any trends, there were just 65 new positive cases announced today. Germany’s Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious disease is to reduce the coronavirus risk level for the country to “high” from “very high”, health minister Jens Spahn said. A leading scientific adviser to the UK government has repeated calls to delay the 21 June lifting of restrictions by “a few weeks”, warning the coronavirus’s ability to adapt in the face of vaccines has still left the UK in a vulnerable position. Ireland will begin to gradually phase out temporary coronavirus-related jobless payments later this year while maintaining other income and business supports as the economy fully reopens, public expenditure minister Michael McGrath. Australians who have been vaccinated against Covid would be able to leave the country and return with less strict quarantine requirements under a plan that could be trialled within six weeks. Our community team are interested to hear about your experiences of travelling through Heathrow, now that London’s airport has opened up a terminal specifically to deal with arrivals from the so-called “red list” countries. If you’ve travelled and want to get in touch with them, you can find all the details here… Australians who have been vaccinated against Covid would be able to leave the country and return with less strict quarantine requirements under a plan that could be trialled within six weeks. The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, revealed the proposal in the Coalition party room on Tuesday following a question from Liberal MP Jason Falinski, who had asked whether vaccination could see people exempted from outbound and inbound travel restrictions. Australia shut its borders in March 2020 in response to the coronavirus pandemic imposing two weeks hotel quarantine on those arriving into the country. Outbound travel is also banned – which was upheld by the full federal court on Tuesday – although more than 140,000 Australian citizens and residents have travelled overseas for critical business, on compassionate grounds or for other exempted reasons. With Australia struggling to vaccinate its population by the end of 2021, there is pressure on the federal government to provide incentives to get the jab and to ease the travel ban that has separated families. About 40,000 Australians remain stranded overseas due to flight caps imposed as a result of limited hotel quarantine beds.

These are the four you need to know: Alpha - UK/Kent (B.1.1.7) Beta - South Africa (B.1.351) Gamma - Brazil (P.1) Delta - India (B.1.617.2) For ease of use to start with, I’ll try to make sure I am using all three ways of naming each variant until we all get more acquainted with the new terminology. There’s fuller details here: Covid-19 variants to be given Greek alphabet names to avoid stigma The proposed Copa América this summer is in some disarray, with reports that Brazil will replace hosts Argentina, just 13 days before it is due to start. “The Copa América 2021 will be played in Brazil,” an official Conmebol statement said. “Tournament start and end dates are confirmed. The venues and the fixtures will be announced by Conmebol in the next few hours.” The tournament, featuring 10 South American nations, had been due to be held in Argentina and Colombia with joint hosts for the first time in its 105-year history. Colombia was removed as a co-host on 20 May after a wave of protests demanding social and economic change spread across the country, and Argentina has followed. Now Reuters report that Chilean national soccer star Arturo Vidal has been diagnosed with Covid-19 and is in hospital in what appears to be a an isolated case as the squad readies itself for World Cup qualifying match against Argentina on 3 June. “He was diagnosed positive for Covid in the daily preventive exam performed today,” the team said in a statement late yesterday. The team plan to travel to Argentina for the game today. A quick Reuters snap here that Germany’s Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious disease is to reduce the coronavirus risk level for the country to “high” from “very high” as the situation improves, health minister Jens Spahn said on Tuesday. “We have grounds for optimism,” said Spahn at a news conference with the head of the RKI, Lothar Wieler, who said developments were improving but the pandemic was not yet over. Ireland will begin to gradually phase out temporary coronavirus-related jobless payments later this year while maintaining other income and business supports as the economy fully reopens, public expenditure minister Michael McGrath said today. Ireland is emerging from its third and longest lockdown having had one the strictest regimes in Europe for the last 15 months, leaving more than 300,000 people who lost their jobs claiming the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP). Local media reported that the PUP, which is paid out at a higher rate than regular jobless benefits, would be reduced from September and withdrawn by February 2022. “There won’t be a cliff edge in July, we will be looking at an extension of the PUP but also laying out a pathway towards the normalisation of our social welfare code and ultimately unwinding a payment that is pandemic related,” McGrath told national broadcaster RTE. “The changes will be gradual.” The number of people temporarily or permanently unemployed in Ireland stood at 22.4% at the end April, with around three in four on the PUP. McGrath said he expected that cohort to fall very significantly over coming weeks as the economy reopens. He added that additional supports for businesses reopening would be announced later today. Padraic Halpin reminds us for Reuters that the government allowed all shops to open for the first time this year two weeks ago with the hospitality sector to follow with limited capacity in coming days. Nicola Slawson has launched our UK live blog for the day, with the leads line being the warning that the country is in a “perilous moment”. Join her for the latest UK Covid news as it comes in today. I’ll be continuing here with the latest coronavirus news from around the world. Taiwan has reported 13 new deaths from Covid-19, and 262 new cases. In a sign that authorities are also clearing the backlog of test results which had seen hundreds added to previous daily totals and caused difficulties in analysing any trends, there were just 65 new positive cases announced today. The majority of the new cases remained in the north, with 166 in New Taipei city, 87 in Taipei city, and 23 in Taoyuan. Health and welfare minister Chen Shih-Chung said reinfection rates had declined thanks to the measures introduced over the past two weeks - and the community’s cooperation with them - but said it was still not time to relax. Chen the backlog of cases was expected to be cleared in the next day or two. The daily number of vaccinations has increased, but Taiwan still remains far behind other countries, with less than 2% of its population having received a shot. Taiwan’s problems with a Covid-19 vaccination drive are complicated, and involved accusations of geopolitical interference as well as of government bungling, but the important news from recent days is that the government is now allowing private companies, religious groups and local governments to arrange imports. Tech giant Foxconn and its billionaire founder Terry Gou have sought permission to buy 5 million vaccines from Germany’s BioNTech, to distribute among the general population. Gou said on Saturday they hope to airlift the shots from Germany to Taiwan without going via any middlemen. This has received a lukewarm reaction from the government. Chen expressed his gratitude to Gou and said the government was reviewing the application, adding that while it welcomes help in obtaining vaccines from companies and religious groups, Taiwan’s government has stipulated that only it can distribute the shots. Russia has announced the resumption of air travel with Britain and a number of other countries which had been suspended due to coronavirus restrictions. “Given the improvement of the epidemiological situation in the United Kingdom, a decision has been taken to resume regular air travel between Moscow and London from 2 June,” Russian health authorities said in a statement on Monday. Russia will also resume air travel with Austria, Hungary, Lebanon, Luxembourg, Croatia, Mauritius, and Morocco from 10 June, it said. Flights to Turkey, a major tourist destination for Russians, will remain suspended until at least 21 June. AFP note that since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, Russia’s borders have remained largely closed to foreigners. Heathrow has begun processing arrivals from red list countries in a dedicated terminal following concerns about them mixing with other passengers. Travellers arriving from red list nations on direct flights are being taken to Terminal 3. Passengers travelling to the UK on connecting flights from red list locations continue to transit through the airport alongside those from green and amber countries. The red list currently consists of 43 nations from which arrivals are deemed to present a high risk of importing coronavirus. Red list countries from where direct flights to the UK are permitted include India, the Philippines, Pakistan, Kenya and Bangladesh. Passengers arriving in the UK after being in one of those destinations during the previous 10 days must spend 11 nights in a quarantine hotel, costing 1,750 for solo travellers. The decision to separate arrivals on direct flights from red list destinations was welcomed by the GMB union, which had previously warned that “bottlenecks” are putting passengers and staff at risk. Heathrow insisted there were “several layers of protection to keep passengers and colleagues safe”, such as mandatory testing for all arrivals, segregation and ventilation. PA Media notes that an airport executive said in April that passengers are being forced to queue for up to six hours to be processed through immigration halls. It is the first time Terminal 3 has been used since April 2020, when it was closed to save costs amid the collapse in demand for travel. Heathrow plans to move its new facility for processing red list arrivals to Terminal 4 “as soon as operationally possible”. The pressure to get England’s Covid restrictions dropped on 21 June is coming from several quarters, not least those sectors of the hospitality industry that are still unable to open their doors. CEO of the Night Time Industries Association, Michael Kill, has been pushing for earlier clarification of when reopening might happen. He told Sky News: Nine out of 10 late-night businesses feel that veering off the roadmap would threaten their survival. Ninety-five per cent of businesses have already made financial commitments in terms of stock, staff and entertainment. So this is a key time, and the government really needs to step up and make it very clear exactly what their intentions are. The UK’s small businesses minister Paul Scully has been on LBC this morning reiterating the message from the government that people in the UK should use “caution” in the face of the growing number of cases of the “Delta” variant of coronavirus – the B.1.617.2 variant first detected in India. He stressed again that no decision would be taken until 14 June, saying: I know for some people that won’t be quick enough, but we’ve got to make sure that we are working with the latest data, accurate data. Scientists have to be able to go through this with a fine tooth comb, because it’s a really really important decision that affects so many people. Pressed about whether the country was in fact seeing increased hospitalisations and what the threat to the NHS currently was, he said: We’ve just got to make sure that we are looking forward to see what happens in the next few weeks and months in terms of that modelling, based on the data. Because what we do know is that when case rates go up, hospitalisations to date have also gone up. But the vaccination progress is still continuing with 63 million vaccinations and that is what is going to help us win this race. Eddie Blake writes for us this morning, asking what should Britain’s memorial to the Covid pandemic look like? Memorials aim to be an eloquent last word on an event. A key quality is that they resist change: they attempt to fix for us an abiding sense of what exactly has happened. They can be many things: columns, tombs, plaques, cenotaphs, village halls, even housing. But who are they for? The people who suffered, their families, the wider public or future generations? At some point, inevitably, there will be an official, national memorial of the pandemic in the UK (as well as many more, surely, at local and international levels). What, then, should it look like? It will have to contend with how messy the past year has been – the death, the sorrow, the fear, but also the ensuing political and social division. Perhaps through all of that, memorialisation can play a therapeutic role. Memorials naturally remove some of the complexity of the past, replacing it with something smoother, better suited to a broad audience: the tomb of the Unknown Warrior doesn’t address one specific loss, so it can talk of all loss. Because of this universal ambition it is vital public memorials hit the right tone – being both honest and broadly interpretable, tending to avoid friction. As a result, though, memorials can feel as if they don’t talk to you directly or seem too vague. But at a time when narratives are brutally contested, it seems unlikely that a pandemic memorial will avoid controversy, no matter how skilful the architect. Read more here: Eddie Blake – What should Britain’s memorial to the Covid pandemic look like? Prof Adam Finn, from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, is a second expert in the UK on the airwaves today warning against further easing of domestic restrictions on 21 June. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “There’s vulnerability across the country. The idea that somehow the job is done, is wrong. “We’ve still got a lot of people out there who’ve neither had this virus … nor yet been immunised, and that’s why we’re in a vulnerable position right now.” PA Media reports Finn added: “There are a lot of people who are very fed up about the idea of us even worrying about this. Since I’ve been saying in the last 24 hours that we should be cautious I’ve been getting lots of messages from people telling me to shut up basically. “But the truth is that a more infectious virus, which is what it looks like we’ve got, will reach people who are vulnerable – those who did not make a good response to the vaccine, those who have not yet had their doses – and that will be a problem for everyone because in the end it will be worse economically as well as for public health if we end up having to shut down again.” Chinese authorities in Guangdong province have cancelled flights and locked down communities in response to what is believed to be the first community outbreak of the “Delta” or Indian variant in China. Guangdong province had been reporting daily single figures of local cases, including asymptomatic cases, for more than a week, until the case load suddenly jumped to 23 on Monday, including three asymptomatic cases, and 11 on Tuesday. Most of Guandong’s cases are in the city of Guangzhou, with some in nearby Foshan, which has a population of 7.2 million. Authorities said all cases were found to be the strain commonly known as the Indian variant of the virus, now renamed by the WHO as the “Delta” variant. “In this race against the virus, we must run a bit ahead and run faster than before in order to block the spread of the virus and cut off the infection chain in time,” said Huang Guanglie, director of the Guangzhou municipal health commission. Guangzhou deputy mayor, Li Ming, said the strain had a short incubation period, a high viral load, and spread quickly. However she said that the trajectory was “under control”. In response hundreds of flights at the busy Guangdong Baiyun international airport have been cancelled, and authorities ordered some streets in the Liwan neighbourhood of Guangzhou city to isolate at home, with only one person per household allowed out to buy daily necessities. On Sunday, all 15.3 million Guangzhou residents were barred from leaving via bus, air or train without a green code on the health management app and a negative Covid test taken in the preceding 72 hours. Read more of Helen Davidson’s report here: China locks down part of Guangzhou amid outbreak of Indian Covid variant Malaysia has begun a tough nationwide lockdown to battle a worsening coronavirus outbreak, AFP reports, as countries across Southeast Asia struggle with a resurgence in cases driven by infectious variants. It writes, Much of the region escaped the pandemic’s first wave last year relatively unscathed by rapidly closing borders and introducing curbs. But countries from Thailand to Vietnam are being hammered by fresh surges, with efforts to quell outbreaks hampered by slow vaccine rollouts and populations weary of restrictions. Malaysia is among the worst hit. Of almost 2,800 deaths from Covid-19 recorded in the country of 32 million since the start of the pandemic, over 40 percent were in May alone. More than 570,000 infections have been reported, with a string of new daily records last week. As well as variants, the outbreak has been fanned by gatherings in the Muslim-majority country during the holy month of Ramadan and the Eid al-Fitr holiday, often in defiance of coronavirus rules. Under what authorities have termed a “total lockdown” in force from Tuesday, only essential businesses - such as supermarkets and medical clinics - can operate, people can only go outside for necessities, and most schools are closed. Travel between most parts of the country had already been banned for months. Just following up on Prof Ravi Gupta’s words there with a quick check on the UK government’s own coronavirus dashboard, and we can see that with data in from 31 May now, that the rolling seven-day averages of cases, deaths and hospitalisations are all up – all admittedly from a baseline much lower than was in the earlier peak of the second wave of the virus. You can have look for yourself here. A leading scientific adviser to the UK government has repeated calls to delay the 21 June lifting of restrictions by “a few weeks”, warning the coronavirus’s ability to adapt in the face of vaccines has still left the UK in a vulnerable position. Prof Ravi Gupta, a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), said the increased socialisation which has followed last month’s phase of restriction lifting could be expected to lead to “quite a lot” of hospital admissions. PA Media reports that he told ITV’s Good Morning Britain that while the nation had performed “amazingly well” in its vaccination programme, it was still too early “to put the vaccine straight up against the virus”. Gupta said a delay of a few weeks to the 21 June target could have a significant impact on Britain’s battle against the pandemic, and recommended it should be made clear to the public that it would be a temporary measure based on recent events, chiefly the emergence of the newly-designated “Delta variant”, which we had previously been calling the B.1.617.2 strain of the virus or the variant that was first detected in India. “Even a month delay could have a big impact on the eventual outcome of this,” said Prof Gupta. He continued: “As long as it’s clear to people this is not an unlimited extension of the lockdown but actually just a reassessment, that would be realistic. “Because we didn’t plan for the 617.2 variant when the initial roadmap was made, and actually things have gone really well except for the fact that we have this new variant to complicate things. “We must remember this is a virus that does adapt, and faced with vaccines it will eventually start to make mutations to avoid them even further, and then we could be in an even more precarious situation after that.” Vietnam is seeking to buy Covid-19 vaccine production technology and wants to build a plant to supply the Covax programme, Reuters reports, as the country tries to step up vaccinations to stem a new outbreak of infections. India and South Africa are among developing countries that have been pushing for an intellectual property waiver for Covid-19 vaccines. But even with a surprise US shift last month to support a waiver World Trade Organization talks on the issue on Monday failed to achieve a breakthrough. “Vietnam would build the plant and would like to receive the patent so it could supply vaccines to Covax, to other countries as well as to Vietnam,” the health ministry said in a statement, following a meeting with Covax representatives overnight. India has reported its lowest daily rise in new coronavirus infections since 8 April at 127,510 cases over the past 24 hours, while deaths rose by 2,795, Reuters reports. The South Asian nation’s tally of infections now stands at 28.2 million, while the death toll has reached 331,895, health ministry data showed. That’s it from me, Helen Livingstone, for today. I’m handing over to my colleague Martin Belam in London. Here’s a quick roundup of what’s been happening so far: Peru has revised its official Covid-19 death toll to 180,764, nearly triple the previous official figure of 69,342, following a government review that shows the severity of the outbreak in the country. As new coronavirus variants continue to be discovered, the World Health Organization has revealed new names, after the letters of the Greek alphabet, to simplify the discussion around the variants and avoid stigma. Australia’s drug regulator says it may refer anti-vaccination Facebook posts to federal police after anti-vaccine campaigners targeted an MP who posted about getting the jab. Australia’s federal court has rejected a bid by a rightwing thinktank to overturn the country’s ban on outbound travel. US gun sales spiked during the pandemic and continue to rise, with first-time buyers making up more than a fifth of those who purchased guns Germany has pledged to crack down on fraud in coronavirus test centres, after evidence that some have been claiming for more tests than they have carried out. Scientists are urging the government to speed up second doses of Covid vaccines and delay a decision on easing lockdown restrictions in England on 21 June in an effort to tackle the creeping spread of new cases. France has opened up vaccines to all adults a week before Germany, as Europe rushed to avoid another wave of infections caused by new virus variants. Vietnam has announced the suspension of incoming international flights to its capital and tightened restrictions in its biggest city. The inbound flight suspension to Hanoi will apply from 1-7 June. Travellers from the UK will have to provide “compelling reasons” to enter France from Monday, as French authorities tighten curbs to halt the spread of the Indian Covid variant. The European Commission has proposed that all EU countries gradually ease travel measures over the summer. School closures in England during the Covid lockdown badly damaged the mental health of mothers but had no impact on fathers’ wellbeing, research has found. Here’s a sobering, but important, feature by Guardian contributor V on the ways in which the pandemic has erased women’s rights and left them vulnerable to violence. She writes, All over the world, patriarchy has taken full advantage of the virus to reclaim power – on the one hand, escalating the danger and violence to women, and on the other, stepping in as their supposed controller and protector. And in more Australia-related Covid news, the country’s drug regulator is considering referring Covid vaccine misinformation posts to the federal police, after anti-vaccine campaigners targeted an MP who posted about getting the jab. In response to a viral post of Labor backbencher Julian Hill receiving his vaccine, numerous users posted false material purportedly from the Therapeutic Goods Administration wrongly claiming Covid-19 vaccines have caused more than 200 deaths. The figure they used was in fact the number of people who have died after receiving the vaccine, but apart from one case, none have been linked by the TGA to the vaccine. The TGA told Guardian Australia the alleged posting of the death counter was “particularly concerning” and it would consider referring it to the federal police. Australia’s federal court has rejected a bid by a rightwing thinktank to overturn the country’s ban on outbound travel. Libertyworks had argued that the health minister, Greg Hunt, has no power to impose a blanket rule stopping citizens from leaving the country. But Justices Anna Katzmann, Michael Wigney and Thomas Thawley dismissed the application and ordered Libertyworks to pay the commonwealth’s costs. The federal government had argued that, if successful, the case would have “driven a truck” through Hunt’s powers under the Biosecurity Act to impose measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19 during the global pandemic.

And if it was completely useless, with a challenge trial you could have found that out in weeks rather than months.”</p> \n<p>Fraser-Urquhart was one of the first few participants of the first phase of the challenge trial, in which pre-screened volunteers went into quarantine at the Royal Free hospital in London.</p> \n<p>A few days in, the virus was administered nasally by a scientist wearing full personal protective equipment (PPE) as Fraser-Urquhart lay on the bed in a T-shirt and jeans.

But there are actual volunteers – young and healthy people – who elected to be infected with the virus, all in the name of science. These volunteers lined up to participate in “human challenge trials”, which have long been successfully employed to develop vaccines for diseases from typhoid to cholera. The world’s first such trial for Covid kicked off in the UK this March with scientists attempting to establish the minimum dose of the virus required to cause infection in volunteers aged 18 to 30. However, Cummings, in his seven-hour appearance before a Commons inquiry hearing last week, suggested that the challenge trials should have been initiated much earlier. Had that been done, he said, the vaccination rollout could have kicked off in September 2020 instead of months later. Alastair Fraser-Urquhart signed up “instantly” to be part of the challenge trial and serves as UK chapter manager of 1Day Sooner, a non-profit organisation advocating for human challenge study volunteers. He said: “We got really, really lucky with … mRNA being a viable platform, but there was no guarantee of that whatsoever. And if it was completely useless, with a challenge trial you could have found that out in weeks rather than months.” Fraser-Urquhart was one of the first few participants of the first phase of the challenge trial, in which pre-screened volunteers went into quarantine at the Royal Free hospital in London. A few days in, the virus was administered nasally by a scientist wearing full personal protective equipment (PPE) as Fraser-Urquhart lay on the bed in a T-shirt and jeans. There were about six people in full PPE in his designated room: “One of them was like in the corner just counting down the seconds … like a rocket launch or something,” said Fraser-Urquhart. The experience was in equal parts terrifying and amazing, he said. “Being in the room with a vast amount of extraordinarily pure [medical grade] virus … it just looked like water, but you don’t expect to see coronavirus like that.” After being dosed, subjects lie there for 10 minutes and then sit up and stay in that position for another 20 minutes, explained Jacob Hopkins, who was the first volunteer to be directly infected with the virus. “We actually ended up like … high-fiving each other. It was a really weird moment, where it’s like, yay, Covid?! And then the whole thing just began.” After exposure, the participants were monitored 24 hours a day for at least 14 days, with blood samples and nose swabs taken every day. Both Fraser-Urquhart and Hopkins felt fine for the first few days after exposure but experienced a “rough” couple of days before bouncing back. “Honestly, it wasn’t an easy thing to do but it was incredible, it’s one of the best things I’ve done in my life and maybe ever will do,” said Hopkins. “When you’re part of something that can do so much good … it’s really just an amazing feeling really to be involved.” After being discharged, the participants will be followed up for a year so that researchers can monitor any long-lasting symptoms.

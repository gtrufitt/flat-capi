Amanda Spielman, Her Majesty’s chief inspector of schools, said it was “concerning” that secondary schools were allowing pupils on GCSE and A-level courses to end the summer term six weeks or more early, meaning that some 15 and 16-year-olds would have 100 days of holiday before the new year started in September. Spielman said Ofsted “will want to know” how schools are using the remainder of the term to help their pupils in the exam year groups – year 11 and year 13 – catch up on learning lost during the pandemic lockdowns. Schools usually allow students to go on study leave before their exams. This year exams for GCSEs, BTecs and A-levels have been cancelled and replaced by teacher assessment, but many schools still allowed students to leave at the end of May, after the deadline for work to be included in teacher assessments. Spielman said in a statement to the Guardian: The Department for Education has set clear expectations for schools to encourage year 11 and 13 pupils to continue their education during the last half of the summer term, even if the work they do doesn’t contribute towards their final grades. This makes sense as many pupils have struggled to learn remotely, and so haven’t got as far as they might otherwise have done. This leaves them less well-prepared for post-16 or post-18 education, so it is concerning that some pupils could be allowed to finish the term early. We will want to know how schools are using the remainder of the summer term for these year groups. Read the full story here: A total of 17,162 people tested positive for Covid-19 in England at least once in the week to May 26, up 22% on the previous week, according to the latest Test and Trace figures. It is the highest number of people testing positive since the week to April 14, PA news reports. The UK government is “open-minded” on SNP calls to extend furlough, and there will be no post-Covid austerity measures, according to Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove. Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has called for the job support scheme to be extended “for as long as it is needed”, ahead of four nations recovery summit this afternoon. The meeting was cancelled at short notice last week after Sturgeon and her Welsh counterpart, Mark Drakeford, said the agenda was far too woolly. The summit was proposed by Boris Johnson immediately after the SNP won a landslide victory in the Holyrood elections and Welsh Labour won 50% of the seats in the Welsh Senedd, in what was seen as evidence of a more conciliatory approach by the Tories in London in response to the upsurge in support for independence in both nations. Speaking to the BBC’s Good Morning Scotland, Gove said he was “open-minded” on the furlough proposal, adding it was a “huge success” that was only possible “thanks to the broad shoulders of the UK Treasury”. He insisted there would be no austerity measures following the Covid crisis: We’ll be spending more on the NHS, education, criminal justice, because in all of these areas its absolutely vital that we build back better... the extra funding for everyone across the UK will continue. A generation of children is at risk of being failed by the government if it does not properly address the educational needs caused by lost learning during the Covid pandemic, a social mobility expert has said. The comments came after the unexpected resignation of the government’s schools recovery chief, Sir Kevan Collins, who quit on Wednesday in protest over its watered-down offer of £1.5bn in funding to help schoolchildren in England catch up on lost learning – a tenth of the £15bn he had recommended. In his resignation letter, Collins said “the half-hearted approach risks failing thousands of pupils” and fell “far short” of what was needed to meet the scale of the challenge. He warned disadvantaged and vulnerable children would suffer most and the impact was likely to be “particularly severe” in parts of the country where schools were closed for longer, such as the north. Lee Elliot Major, a professor of social mobility at Exeter University, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that children in England had lost 110 of 190 classroom days, and about 2 million children received no learning at all during the first lockdown. Describing Collins as “one of the most respected” people in the sector, the professor said he would not have taken the decision to step down lightly. “I just hope it’s a wake-up call for government to see this as the beginning of a much bigger, more ambitious programme. Read the full story here: The Scottish government’s minister for Covid recovery has said that he is currently reviewing whether new variants of the virus are having a greater impact on children, with numbers on under 10s hospitalised “on the high side”. John Swinney was asked this morning about comments by health secretary Humza Yusuf that 10 children aged between zero and nine were in hospital last week because of Covid. Swinney told BBC Scotland’s Good Morning Scotland: If you go back over the last 12 months relatively few children have been hospitalised as a consequence of Covid. We’re really seeing obviously a concentration of hospitalisation outwith the over 50s group, because the overwhelming majority of that group are vaccinated and have some protection. The current numbers [for children hospitalised] are on the high side, and certainly over the period of Covid we’ve not seen very many children hospitalised but we are seeing a number just now. So we have to look at all of these factors to determine is there something in the new variants that are emerging that is making it more acutely challenging for children with a greater health impact? Matt Hancock has said that an internationally agreed approach to coronavirus vaccine certification remains “some way off”. Speaking ahead of a G7 health ministers’ meeting, the health secretary told reporters: Ultimately there are a number of countries around the world that have said they’re definitely going to have a requirement to be vaccinated in order to travel. We’re making sure that here any Brit can see their vaccine status. But we’re some way off having an internationally agreed approach for that. It’s something we talk about and are discussing but there’s still a lot of work to do. Health secretary Matt Hancock has said it remains “too early” to say whether all coronavirus restrictions can end on June 21. Speaking ahead of a G7 health ministers’ meeting, he told reporters: It’s too early to say what the decision will be about step four of the road map, which is scheduled to be no earlier than June 21. Of course I look at those data every day, we publish them every day, the case numbers matter but what really matters is how that translates into the number of people going to hospital, the number of people sadly dying. The vaccine breaks that link - the question is how much the link has yet been broken because the majority of people who ended up in hospital are not fully vaccinated. That’s a good sign if you like because it means that the vaccine is clearly protecting people from ending up in hospital but it also demonstrates that we need to keep going with this vaccine programme. The UK government is “open minded” about extending the furlough scheme, a leading member of Boris Johnson’s cabinet has insisted. Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon will use a four-nations summit with the Prime Minister on Thursday to push for the job retention scheme to continue beyond its current September expiry date. Now Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove has indicated it could be continued. Asked about the possibility of this, he said: “We are open minded, yes.” Speaking ahead of the four-nations summit on tackling Covid, Gove said the initiative, which sees the taxpayer pay cash towards workers’ wages, had been a “huge success” that was only possible “thanks to the broad shoulders of the UK Treasury”. The UK government minister insisted higher spending as a response to the coronavirus pandemic would continue, as the country as a whole seeks to “build back better”. The Scottish government has voiced concerns about a possible return to austerity from the Conservatives at Westminster, but Gove told BBC Radio Scotland’s Good Morning Scotland programme: We’ll be spending more. We’ll be spending more on the NHS, we will be spending more on education, we will be spending more on criminal justice, because in all of these areas it is absolutely vital that we build back better. Extra funding for everyone will continue, and it is important we all learn from each other about how that money should be spent. His comments come ahead of a virtual coronavirus recovery summit involved Johnson and the leaders of the devolved governments in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast. The rearranged meeting was due to take place last week but was postponed after the first ministers of Wales and Scotland pulled out because they wanted it to be a “meaningful discussion with substantive outcomes”. Both Sturgeon and Mark Drakeford subsequently wrote to the prime minister asking for more substance and clarity about the summit. There is growing speculation that popular holiday islands could be added to the government’s travel green list on Thursday. Spanish and Greek islands plus Malta are among the destinations which experts believe may be given green status. That would mean people visiting those locations from the UK will no longer be required to quarantine on their return. Robert Boyle, former director of strategy at British Airways’ parent company IAG, predicted that a number of summer hotspots will be added to the green tier. He wrote in a blog post: It still seems very likely that whilst Spain and Greece will not make it onto the green list, many of their islands will, due to lower case rates and higher vaccinations than on the mainland. Malta, Finland and Slovakia are fairly safe bets, based on high testing rates and low reported cases. Paul Charles, chief executive of travel consultancy The PC Agency, said a number of popular holiday destinations “really deserve” to be moved to the low-risk tier. He expects additions to the green list to include the Greek islands of Zante, Rhodes and Kos, the Caribbean islands of Grenada and Antigua, plus Malta and Finland. But he said he would be “surprised” if Spain’s Balearic Islands - including Ibiza, Majorca and Menorca - were added on Thursday. He told the PA news agency: They’re hugely popular and I’m not sure the government is ready to encourage so much travel at the moment. Portugal is the only viable major tourist destination currently on the green list, but there have been reports it could be downgraded to amber. The government has urged people to avoid non-essential travel to amber and red countries. Travellers returning from amber list locations - which include popular hotspots such as Spain, France, Italy and Greece - must quarantine at home for 10 days and take two post-arrival tests. Several additions to the red list are expected on Thursday. Boyle explained that Bahrain, Costa Rica, Trinidad and Tobago and Kuwait “ought to be on the list” due to “very high infection rates”, whereas Mr Charles warned that Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia and Indonesia could be added as there are “signs of increased infection in many parts of Asia”. People returning to the UK from a red country are required to spend 11 nights in a quarantine hotel, at a cost of 1,750 for solo travellers. Assessments of travel lists are based on a range of factors, including the proportion of a population that has been vaccinated, rates of infection, emerging new variants, and access to reliable scientific data and genomic sequencing. The public should “exercise their common sense” about travelling abroad, a home office minister has said. Asked on Times Radio whether her department would rather people stayed in the UK, Victoria Atkins said: We’re very, very, very supportive of the traffic light system. There are some countries in the world at the moment that because of the variants and the rates of infection are simply too dangerous for us to visit in terms of Covid, and of course they are on the red list. We then have the amber list which we very much ask people not to travel to unless there are very particular, very dire consequences they’re having to deal with, such as a dying relative, and then the green list. And look, the overall goal, we all want to get back to normality, pre-pandemic normality. But I think all understand we’ve got to take careful steps to do that. And so the travel plan and travel lists are very much part of our road map out of lockdown restrictions, but we do have to look at the data. We do have to look at what is happening elsewhere in the world, in order to help advise the public as to what is allowed and what is not allowed. But as with anything, we’re asking the public to exercise their common sense and that is the way that we’re going to be able to return to normality. Senior Tory MP Robert Halfon said the government must “decide their priorities in terms of education” and that the Treasury can “find the money from the back of the sofa”, where there is the political will. The chairman of the education select committee told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: Of course there are funding constraints but the treasury announced over 16 billion extra for defence only last year, we’ve got 800 million being spent on a new research agency, 200 million being spent on a yacht. So where there is the political will, the treasury can find the money from the back of the sofa, and there has to be that political will because we need a long-term plan for education, a proper funding settlement.” He said the damage caused by Covid-19 to younger children “has been nothing short of disastrous”. He added: We need some radical thinking, some thinking out of the box, a proper long-term plan (for education) and I will keep campaigning for that, and a proper funding settlement so that that plan is properly resourced. Home Office minister Victoria Atkins told Sky News the amount allocated by the government to help pupils catch up after the pandemic was “huge”. She said the government was “determined to get (children) back on track” and insisted the 1.4 billion announced on Wednesday for tutoring was “a huge amount of money”. Atkins said the government’s education recovery fund was “very much focused on what we can deliver and deliver quickly”, despite former catch-up tsar Sir Kevan Collins citing in his resignation statement that the package of support is “too narrow, too small and will be delivered too slowly”. She told Sky News the government was “continuing to look at things like lengthening the school day”. She said she had not read the resignation statement issued by Collins. Asked on Sky News whether the government was doing enough for children worst affected by the pandemic, especially in the north and more deprived areas where Collins said impacts would be “particularly severe”, the home office minister said: “Well, I haven’t read his statement. I’m not sure that was quite the point he was making at that point, if I may say so.” She said: But what I’m saying is the point about targeting those children who are most affected by the pandemic is absolutely what this money is about. We want to have a course of tutoring, 15-hour tutoring courses for up to six million of these courses, that’s 100 million tuition hours extra that this money is paying for. And it’s going to be helping those children who are most disadvantaged by this. We’ve got to spend this money wisely, we want it to have the most impact it can possibly have, and that’s why, looking at the evidence that we’ve seen thus far we’re focusing on this one-to-one tuition, to really try to boost children’s chances in the years ahead. Shadow treasury minister James Murray said Labour’s proposals for a catch-up fund would have seen a similar amount of investment as suggested by Sir Kevan Collins. Murray told Sky News: I think what the government has been exposed as having done is not prioritising children’s education, not prioritising the wellbeing of children, and this is the chancellor’s responsibility for not putting the funding forward. He said the funding from the plans should come from “Covid reserves”. If the government does not properly address education needs, a whole generation of children could be failed, an expert has said. Dr Lee Elliot Major, professor of social mobility at the University of Exeter, described departing education tsar Sir Kevan Collins as “one of the most respected” people in the sector and said he would not have taken the decision to step down lightly. Major said “at least 10 times the amounts that were announced yesterday would be needed for children to have a chance of catching up”. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: I just hope that it’s a wake-up call for government to see this as the beginning of a much bigger, more ambitious programme. What we do know, and I think there is a lot of evidence around this, is that extra teaching for children will have huge benefits. And remember this is an investment for the future. If we don’t address these issues now the real fear is that we will fail a whole generation. This is about a whole generation of children and so my belief is that there is compelling evidence that, if done well, if you extend teaching, then that will help us catch up. I don’t see any other way of doing it.","charCount":"17737","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/nicola-slawson\">Nicola Slawson</a>"},{"headline":"England v New Zealand: first Test, day two – live!

The incumbent pair added 102 chanceless runs through the course of the final session. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/selvecricket/status/1400375396508516359\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Might be a bit more swing for Jimmy this morning.

He’s already the highest scorer at Lord’s when appearing for the first time and now has the chance to join the small club of international players to make that a double. Nicholls’ turn, on the front foot scoring again, grabbing three past point. And now four more for Conway, steering to deep third as he has so well - despite going through fourth slip, he’s played that with control. It prompts a chat between Broad and Root, third slip coming out. To Plan B. 91st over: New Zealand 265-3 (Conway 149, Nicholls 51) The second over in a row where Anderson has started with a half-volley, put away this time through point by Conway. “Excellent,” says Nasser, “waiting for hit to pass him then flat-batting it for four.” Jimmy is again back where he needs to be soon enough, locating the opener’s inside edge. The Black Caps have added 19 runs in 20 minutes. 90th over: New Zealand 258-3 (Conway 143, Nicholls 50) A lovely way for Nicholls to bring up his half-century, on-driving Broad into the rope beneath the pavilion. He’s been such a big part of New Zealand’s rise over the last three years - a very good cricketer, averaging 45 in Tests, ranked sixth in the world by the ICC. 89th over: New Zealand 254-3 (Conway 143, Nicholls 46) Half-volley, put away by Conway to the grandstand side of the ground. Shot. Sure enough, Anderson is back on his length straight away, up again for leg before, but much as it was in his previous over, going just over the top. Good cricket. “That’s the length at Lord’s,” says Nasser. 88th over: New Zealand 250-3 (Conway 139, Nicholls 46) The 250 is up with a delightful straight drive, a shot Conway played so well yesterday either side of his century milestone. They take three. Beforehand, Bracey mishandled a ball that swung late, spitting away for a bye. The wicketkeeper is in the game again later in the over with Broad’s scramble-seamer doing plenty after Nicholls shoulders arms. Lord’s, as they say, is never an easy place for stumpers. And here, my friends, is the overseas TMS link! Enjoy! 87th over: New Zealand 246-3 (Conway 136, Nicholls 46) Ouch, Jimmy, running in from the Nursery End, gets one to take off from a good length first ball of the day, Conway ripping his bottom hand off the blade at the point of contact. A reminder that this second new ball is only six overs old, so this is an important passage. Good leave later in the over, bouncing over off-stump. Now a shout for leg before with one going beyond the left-hander’s inside edge, but it’s pitched outside leg; no review. All told, a predictably probing start. The players are on the field. James Anderson, the floor is yours. Conway to face for New Zealand. PLAY! “Hi, Adam.” Morning, Andrew Moore. “As someone with virtually no social media profile am curious as to why this is coming out now? Has it been deliberately timed to damage Ollie Robinson (which in itself would be a pretty vile thing to do), or is it the result of people on Twitter searching his history due to his increased exposure.” Good question. A bit of both, I reckon. Not that this is the answer (as Nasser said perfectly on TV last night) but it’s remarkable to me that Robinson’s support team didn’t have the presence of mind to clean this up before he was in the spotlight. It’s widely acknowledged by the man himself that he had a few anger issues. Did nobody twig that there might be some dreadful tweets out there? Odd. Nice stuff. Reminds me of the story of Mark Waugh in 1993. So certain they were that he was marching towards 100, a teammate already popped up the sticky tape on the Lord’s board. Sure enough, out for 99; one of two men to fall one short of a ton in that Test. But it worked out for Waugh in the end, his name up there eight years later after completing his 19th Test century - a gorgeous knock. There’ll be a lot of emails about Robinson. I’ll try my best to read them all and will include some, but plese don’t be cross with me if your note doesn’t appear. Here’s one to open the batting. “Hiya, Collo.” Morning, Iain McKane. “Seems Robinson’s sanction may be at least that handed down to Craig Overton for his offensive remarks a few years back. Robinson’s age/immaturity at the time (and, if it can be proved, his state of mind then, during an apparently tempestuous time in his life) should be taken into account in mitigation of sanction; but, this is a serious matter, whatever your age. A ban for at least the next Test would seem appropriate and reasonable, if within the ECB’s powers. I would also recommend OR undertakes some professionally-mediated meetings with members of the England set-up from minority backgrounds, as well as further education programmes.” It’s a lovely morning in London. 20 degrees now; expected to reach 24 this afternoon. On account of the fact they maintained such a poor over rate yesterday - always a risk when not playing a spinner - the hosts only got six overs in with the second new ball before stumps. So, an opening for Anderson and Broad before Conway (136) and Nicholls (48) get themselves in again. The incumbent pair added 102 chanceless runs through the course of the final session. Mark Wood is talking to TMS. “I saw him at breakfast.

So, mentally if his head is in that space, I think he can do the business as he did yesterday.” Sky are on air. There will be a lot of attention on what the commentators have to say in response to Robinson’s statement. “I was pretty depressed when I left the ground last night,” Mike Atherton begins. “It should have been the greatest day of his cricketing life but he ends up giving a humiliating apology.

One regular day of England cricket / That’s all I ask / Will never happen. And so it was yesterday at Lord’s. Sure, it was conventional enough on the scoreboard, New Zealand ticking along very nicely to reach 246-3 with Devon Conway marching to a quite outstanding unbeaten 136 on debut. However, anyone playing along via twitter through the afternoon session knew that the main action was to come at stumps via another man making his bow, Ollie Robinson.

By the way, you can email me or tweet me with your thoughts on the action if you like: Email here, or tweet @LukeMcLaughlin. C’est bon. Ann Li is ranked 75, and will feel she missed a big chance here against the world No 6: there is no doubt she had Svitolina on the ropes at 4-1 up in the second set. But the fifth-seeded Ukrainian fought back in style and she moves into the third round. Li played some tremendous stuff there, and it was all the more eye-catching after she was blown away in the first set. Positives to take out of that for Li. A horrid mishit from Li, and Svitolina suddenly has two break points. She wins the first one thanks to a positive, attacking return, and she’s now 5-4 up and about to serve for the match. It looks like Li’s fightback is over, unless she can find something special in the next game. Svitolina eventually wins her service game! We are now at 4-4 and the Ukrainian has reminded Li that she is still very much up for this battle. Li wasted a couple of break points there but still has every chance of forcing a deciding set. Absolutely stunning stuff from Li, a searing forehand winner down the line, which forces her second break point of the game. She is targeting Svitolina’s second serve consistently. But she hits long on the next point, and we’re back to deuce. Svitolina’s power and precision is starting to tell again, and Li has made a couple of bad errors including double-faulting in her previous service game. However, Li grinds out an excellent point to force deuce on Svitolina’s serve in this eighth game of the second set ... Svitolina breaks! Thanks to a double fault from Li, it’s back to 4-3 in the second. A significant blow for the fifth-seeded Ukrainian but still plenty of work for her to do. What else? Kenin is 3-0 up on Baptiste in their second set, while the world No 1 Ash Barty has just started her match against Magda Linette on Philippe-Chatrier. Li spices up the longest rally of the match with a sliced backhand. Svitolina, clearly feeling the heat from her reinvigorated opponent, subsequently butchers a deep forehand return a few shots later, sending it tamely wide. Both players are seeing the ball nicely now, finding their groove, and the rallies are warming up. Svitolina looks noticeably stressed between points, all the more so having been in such firm control in the first. The Svitolina of the first set looked set to reappear and dominate her service game - Li fought back to 40-30 - but then coughed up an easy chance for Svitolina to make it 4-2 in this second set. In the men’s, Kwon Soon-woo wins his first set against Seppi, 6-4. Elsewhere: Kenin (seeded fourth) fights her way to a 7-5 set victory against Baptiste, while Muchova takes the first, 6-3, against Lepchenko. Li wins her service game from deuce and goes 4-1 up in the second. It’s hard to overstate how well the American has done to fight back into this match. I said it would be a massive surprise to see anything other than a straight-sets win for Svitolina, and it appears we’re in for a massive surprise. Li sweetly strikes a couple more impressively deep forehands to create a point-winning chance, with a seemingly easy smash to finish, but she sends it long and it’s 30-30 on her service game. Still, what is so impressive is how Li has taken control of most of these exchanges after being blown away in the first set. Elsewhere in the women’s singles: Ons Jabeur of Tunisia (25 seed) takes her first set against Astra Sharma, 6-2, while Jessica Pegula has taken the first set 6-3 against the Czech Tereza Martinicova. Svitolina, meanwhile, steadies the ship and gets a foothold in the second set, which Li now leads 3-1. Wow! A long rally of crushing ground strokes from both players ends with a stunning drop-shot winner by Li, stretching to her right. Svitolina, suddenly, is ashen-faced and battling for every point. It’s 3-0 Li! She looks a different player, with the confidence to craft and shape her shots around the court, in stark contrast to the first set, when she was blown away by Svitolina. Lovely stuff. “So this is going to be 6-0, 0-6, 7-6,” quips the commentator, before remembering that there isn’t a tie-break in the third ... Ann Li, suddenly, is firmly in this match. She breaks for 2-0, striking the ball with authority throughout that service game from Svitolina. There was an aggressive, precise backhand return winner and another sumptuous forehand, and this is a really impressive recovery from the 20-year-old American. Berrettini, seeded ninth, takes that first set against Coria, 6-3. The Italian Berrettini (9) is well on the way to winning the first set against Coria in the men’s singles, forcing a break point at 5-3 up. Li, meanwhile, is on the board! She holds serve and leads 1-0 in the second set against Svitolina. Well played. Svitolina wins the first set against Li, 6-0, closing it out with an immaculate service game. It would be a massive surprise to see anything other than a regulation straight-sets win for Svitolina, the fifth-seeded Ukrainian. Li - who is 20, and was born somewhere pleasingly named ‘King of Prussia’ in Pennsylvania - has now established herself in this match to some extent. She just forced a couple of game points on her serve, and impressively saved a couple of break points too, but her opponent eventually wore her down, and has created a 5-0 first-set lead. Very, very strong stuff from Svitolina: one crushing double-handed backhand down the line was particularly eye-catching there. But Li does at least have something to work with now in the second set. Svitolina is now serving for the first set. Svitolina 4-0 up against Li: it’s one-way traffic at the moment. Elsewhere in the women’s singles, Sofia Kenin (4) and Hailey Baptiste are 2-2 in their first set, Karolina Muchova (18) is 2-1 up on Varvara Lepchenko. Matteo Berrettini (9) leads Federico Coria 3-2 in their men’s singles second-round encounter while Kwon Soon-woo and Andreas Seppi are on serve at 1-1. Elina Svitolina (fifth seed) is taking care of business against Ann Li: She has roared into a 3-0 first-set lead, with a double break of serve, in double-quick time. Li tries a subtle drop, but gets it horribly wrong, which sums up how this first set has gone for the American so far. Might today prove to be Roger Federer’s last stand at Roland Garros?

Federer defeated Uzbekistan’s Denis Istomin in straight sets on Monday, an encouraging return to grand-slam action following a knee injury, while Cilic eased past Frenchman Arthur Rinderknech to set up today’s second-round meeting, which begins at 3pm. Plenty to keep us all occupied before that, of course: Novak Djokovic will be in action from 1.30pm, against Pablo Cuevas of Uruguay. This morning, Sofia Kenin is about to get her match against Hailey Baptiste under way, while Elina Svitolina has just kicked off against Ann Li on Court Suzanne Lenglen, and Ashleigh Barty faces Magda Linette of Poland from 11am on Philippe-Chatrier. This evening, there is the small matter of Rafael Nadal v Richard Gasquet in the men’s singles.

The Office for National Statistics reports that the percentage of businesses currently trading has increased to 87%, the highest proportion since comparable estimates began in June 2020. Another 3% of firms plan to restart trading in the next two weeks, it found. Around 6.3% of firms have paused and don’t expect to reopen in a fortnight, while 3.8% of those surveyed have ceased trading. The biggest change came in the accommodation and food service sector -- where the proportion of companies currently operating has jumped to 61% to 83%, following the reopening of hospitality venues for indoor dining last month. In the transportation and storage industry, the proportion of firms currently trading rose from 67% to 75%. Britain’s pubs have warned they face ‘serious’ staff shortages, having reopened after the lockdown. The British Beer &amp; Pub Association say some landlords have been forced to greatly cut their service, or shut altogether. It has written to employment minister, Mims Davies, urging the Government to urgently do what it can to help the sector with such staff shortages. The BBPA say several factors are to blame. Covid-19 restrictions are more labour-intensive, as you need more staff to run table service, for example. EU nationals not returning to the UK is another factor, they add. The BBPS also wants the government to expand the Youth Mobility Scheme to cover more nations -- currently, this visa scheme is only open to 18-30 yea- olds from Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Japan, Monaco, New Zealand, Republic of Korea, San Marino and Taiwan. It is also pushing for a “more flexible approach to immigration” by reviewing the shortage occupation list, to help pubs hire. Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer &amp; Pub Association, explains: “Our pubs face a serious staffing shortage that has become acute. In some instances pubs are having to reduce capacity or close entirely because they don’t have the staff to open. This is a major concern for our sector as it is hindering its recovery after lockdown. At our heart we are a people business and we need good people to provide the best hospitality. Even before the crisis, pubs in some areas were struggling to find the staff with the skills they need, particularly chefs and kitchen staff. As they reopen and begin their recovery, some have found staff have either moved away or found jobs in other sectors. IHS Markit also reports that the wider UK private sector grew at the fastest pace since its survey began in January 1998. This is based on data from the service sector and manufacturing (which posted record growth in May earlier this week). The surge in demand since reopening has left service sector firms scrambling to find staff -- and forcing some to lift pay to attract staff. Today’s services PMI report shows that payroll numbers rose at the fastest pace since March 2015, with survey respondents citing a combination of new hires and the return of employees from furlough. Many companies reported difficulties with staff availability, especially among consumer service providers, Markit says. And with labour in short supply, some companies are paying higher salaries -- a boost to workers. The PMI report says: Tighter labour market conditions and subsequent rises in salary payments added to cost pressures across the service economy in May. Duncan Brock, Group Director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, says a shortfall of talent is driving up pay. Businesses rushed to increase their operational capacity to meet this demand but were struggling to fill their job vacancies. As staff moved on to other opportunities following the pandemic’s impact on lives and priorities, a potential skills gap in the sector means some firms may struggle to meet their new goals. This shortfall in talent meant the best candidates were increasingly in demand and demanding higher wages, adding to the highest inflationary rise in business costs since July 2008. We will see more pressure for salary rises, as basic living becomes more expensive for everyone as the hike in prices charged by service companies was the highest since 1996.” The UK economy is enjoying “eye-popping” growth as services companies see a surge in demand after lockdown restrictions were eased. Activity at UK service providers jumped in May at the fastest rate in 24 years, according to the latest survey of purchasing managers at UK services firms. Companies reported resurgent business and consumer spending last month, with new orders rising at the fastest pace since October 2013. This encouraged them to take on more staff, with the strongest rate of employment growth for just over six years. Backlogs of work also built up due to a jump in forward bookings, stretched capacities and staff shortages. Covid-19 restrictions were eased in mid-May, meaning that pubs and restaurants could serve indoors. Other other hospitality venues also reopened. This followed the earlier reopening of non-essential shops in April. But this jump in demand is also pushing costs up. Input price inflation reached its highest since July 2008, and companies raised their own prices at the fastest rate since the survey began in 1996. This lifted IHS Markit’s Services PMI up to 62.9 in May, from 61.0 in April. Any reading over 50 shows growth, and this level implies the economy is growing extremely fast after contracting in the first quarter of the year. Its suggests the fastest rate in business activity since May 1997 -- the month in which Tony Blair became prime minister. Tim Moore, economics director at IHS Markit, says the successful Covid-19 vaccine rollout is boosting the economy, and implying very strong growth this quarter. “UK service providers reported the strongest rise in activity for nearly a quarter-century during May as the roll back of pandemic restrictions unleashed pent up business and consumer spending. The latest survey results set the scene for an eye-popping rate of UK GDP growth in the second quarter of 2021, led by the reopening of customer-facing parts of the economy after winter lockdowns. “Pressure on business capacity due to a spike in demand and staff hiring difficulties emerged as a major challenge for service sector companies in May. Job creation was the strongest for over six years, but backlogs of work accumulated to the greatest extent since the summer of 2014. “The successful vaccine roll out has generated a strong willingness to spend and fortified business optimism across the service economy. However, inflationary trends intensified in May as suppliers passed on higher transport bills, staff costs and raw material prices. Imbalanced demand and supply appears to have spread beyond the manufacturing sector, which contributed to the steepest rise in prices charged by service providers since the survey began in July 1996.” Services firms across the euro area have posted their strongest growth in almost three years. With economies reopening from the lockdown, firms reported an increase in output growth, and a rise in volumes of new business for the first time since last July, date firm IHS Markit reports. Backlogs of work rose, encouraging companies to take on additional staff for the fourth month running -- with employment rising at the fastest rate since February 2020 This lifted Markit’s Eurozone services PMI to 55.2 in May, up from 50.5 in April, and the highest level in almost three years. Ireland and Spain reported the fastest services growth, followed by France, while Germany recorded the slowest expansion. The wider eurozone private sector grew at its fastest pace since February 2018, Markit adds, due to strong growth in the manufacturing. Ireland posted the strongest PMI since the survey began 21 years ago. London estate agent Foxtons is also bouncing back from the pandemic. Foxtons told the City that trading momentum has remained strong since its last trading update on 14 April, with sales running ahead of pre-Covid levels. Following a 49% increase in Foxtons Q1 sales revenue versus both 2020 and 2019, the sales commission pipeline has continued to grow and is now 65% ahead of last year and 17% up on 1 January 2021. As a result of the strong trading momentum, adjusted operating profit for the first half of the year is expected to be significantly ahead of both 2020 and 2019. Foxtons faced a shareholder backlash in April, with 44% of investors failing to back its remuneration report after it awarded CEO Nic Budden almost £1m in bonuses, despite taking £4.4m of furlough money and £2.5m in business rates relief. The London stock market has dipped in early trading, dropping from yesterday’s three-week highs. The blue-chip FTSE 100 index is down 47 points or almost 0.7% at 7060 points. Retail stocks are lower, with discounter B&amp;M down 1.7% despite reporting that pretax profits doubled last year after it stayed open during the lockdown. B&amp;M reported that “trading continues to be volatile at a weekly and product category level, in particular since the recent easing of lockdown restrictions.”. DIY chain Kingfisher are down 2.6%, after going ex-dividend this morning (it’s too late to qualify for the next payout to shareholders). National Grid also went ex-divi today; they’re down 4.7%. Travel companies are among the fallers too, with British Airways parent company IAG down 2.5%. Budget airline easyJet have dropped 2.8% (on the smaller FTSE 250 index), amid reports that Portugal could potentially be removed from the UK’s green list, which allows travellers from those countries into England without having to self-isolate on arrival. The government is set to announce revisions to the travel traffic-light system on Thursday, but Whitehall sources expect just a “handful of new places” to be given quarantine-free travel – few of which are tourist destinations... Growth at China’s service sector companies slowed slightly last month. The Caixin services PMI, which racks China’s services firms, fell to 55.1 in May, down from 56.3 in April. That still shows rapid growth, with business activity and new orders up sharply -- but softening compared to April. Caixin says the Covid-19 pandemic appears to have hit exports last month. According to panel members, customer demand continued to recover due to the successful containment of COVID-19 in China, while there were also reports of new product offerings boosting sales. The resurgence of the virus in other regions across the world weighed on new export business, however, which fell for the third time in four months (albeit only slightly). The jump in petrol prices won’t alarm those who have made the switch to electric cars. Converting fossil fuel cars to electric is one option - and former football ace David Beckham has now taken in interest. He’s bought a 10% stake in Lunaz, a Silverstone-based company that electrifies classic cars from Rolls-Royce, Jaguar and Range Rover. Lunas is also planning to use the same technology on bin lorries, and other commercial vehicles. My colleague Jasper Jolly went to see them yesterday for a spin, and reports: Lunaz is part of a small but growing trend of the new battery economy: ripping out polluting engines and installing batteries and electric motors with zero exhaust emissions. The attraction for Beckham became clear during a Guardian test drive on Wednesday afternoon alongside the famous Silverstone race track in the well-upholstered back of a 1961 Rolls-Royce Phantom. Electric motors may lack the engine roar beloved of petrolheads, but the smooth, quiet ride they offer is well suited to the more rarefied atmosphere of chauffeur-driven luxury. At first glance the plush interior could have been hand-upholstered 50 years ago, but wooden charge and power dials tell a different story. New cars powered solely by petrol or diesel engines will be banned by 2030 in the UK, but the government is unlikely to order classic cars off the road, whatever their emissions, while London’s ultra-low emissions zone exempts historic vehicles. Yet there is still growing demand for upgrades in the car market. Workshops are springing up around the country that cater to this new class of customer as batteries finally reach the point where they can be slotted in to older models. The technology is there, but financially, it is likely to be some time before conversions of mass-market cars are within reach. Lunaz charges for classic models start at £245,000 for a Range Rover, putting it within the reach only of the very wealthy. For a historic Rolls-Royce those prices are £350,000 and upwards – very far upwards, judging by the range of bespoke options on offer. One or two new electric motors take up much less space than an engine, allowing Lunaz to squeeze in custom-made batteries and whatever newer technologies customers need, from air conditioning to electric windows, phone chargers and in-built TVs.... More here: Analysts predict that the oil price will continue to rise, as the relaxation of travel restrictions and other curbs are eased. Norbert Rucker, analyst at Swiss bank Julius Baer, explained: The strong demand dynamics and likely delays in the Iran nuclear deal negotiations pushed oil prices above the much-watched $70 per barrel level,” said “We expect oil prices to move well beyond $70 per barrel towards mid-year. Stephen Brennock of oil broker PVM also believes the market could absorb supply increases: “The market is optimistic that growing summer travel and reopening economies will easily accommodate additional OPEC+ production increases and even a possible Iranian return to the market.” CBA commodities analyst Vivek Dhar said in a note this week that demand from drivers was picking up too. “The U.S. driving season is a period that sees higher‑than‑normal fuel consumption. UK traffic is now sitting above pre‑pandemic levels. “We continue to see the oil demand recovery led by the U.S., Europe and China.” Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The oil price has hit a new two-year high, with demand increasing as economies emerge from lockdown, and producers keep supplies curbed. Brent crude has hit its highest level since May 2019 this morning, hitting $71.99 per barrel, having settled at a two-year high overnight. It’s now more than recovered from its slump early in the pandemic: US crude is catching up fast too - hitting $69.40 per barrel, its highest since October 2018. The rally comes after the Opec+ group agreed to maintain its slow easing of production cuts, and as negotiations continue over the Iranian nuclear deal - which could result in oil sanctions being lifted. Opec+ struck an optimistic tone about improving demand this week, which helped lift oil - even though it stuck to its policy of slowly relaxing production cuts. Saudi Arabia’s energy minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, predicted a demand recovery in China and the US in the coming months, with vaccine rollouts helping to rebalance the oil market. And overnight, US crude inventory figures showed a larger-than-expected drop in crude stocks - signaling rising demand, as the peak driving season looms in the US. With European economies reopening after their pandemic lockdowns (although new Covid-19 variants could yet derail these plans), fuel demand could strengthen. And that would potentially push inflation higher in the coming months too. Naeem Aslam, analyst at Avatrade, explains: Basically, traders are feeling a lot more optimistic about the reopening of the global economy and the continuation of the vaccination process. In addition to this, if we look at oil supply, it seems like major oil producers are very much maintaining their discipline. Traders also understand that the US and Iran’s nuclear deal cannot be reinstated that easily, and it will take a while before the previous conditions are enacted. This means no immediate increase in oil supply, and this is also supporting oil prices. Also coming up today The latest services sector PMI reports are expected to show strong growth in the UK, eurozone and the US....and probably intensifying price pressures as well. The latest US jobless claims data will be closely watched, ahead of tomorrow’s Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) jobs report for May - which may show a rebound in hiring after April’s slowdown. We also get the monthly assessment of US private sector payrolls, from ADP. Markets are looking calm, with investors cautious ahead of Friday’s NFP. But that doesn’t extend to the ‘meme stock’ world. Yesterday, a frenzy of trading in Reddit favourites saw cinema chain AMC Entertainment’s stock double to new record highs. AMC is expected to benefit as lockdown measures are rolled back, and people return to the cinema. It also launched a new platform for its sizable retail investor base - which includes a free large popcorn when attending a movie at AMC this summer. But even so, the rally is quite remarkable given the company’s pandemic struggles - sending the firm’s value soaring over $30bn (meaning more pain for the speculative hedge funds betting against it). As Bloomberg explains: The moonshot surge in the shares of AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. has vaulted it into the ranks of some of the world’s most valuable companies. The company has gone from a small cap to a large cap in the space of a few months. A 95% gain amid a retail-trading frenzy on Wednesday left the movie-theater chain with a market capitalization of $31.3bn. That makes it more valuable than half of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 Index. AMC is now worth more than Tyson Foods Inc. and Delta Air Lines Inc. despite projections for the company to bring in a fraction of their revenues.

A lot of people with hopes of a holiday or visiting loved ones abroad will have their eye closely on the situation – we might get that news around 11am this morning.</p> <p>Getting there may prove more of a headache than usual, as AFP report. A year after the coronavirus pandemic emptied airports, air travel associations fear chaos during Europe’s summer holiday season as travellers could wait hours before boarding planes due to health checks.</p> <p>Strict controls are still in place at most European airports even though vaccination campaigns are making progress and infection rates are falling.</p> <p>The International Air Transport Association (IATA) reported last week that on average, people travelling at peak times now stay twice as long at airports - three hours - compared with 2019.</p> <p>That time is generally spent checking in, passing security and immigration controls, picking up checked bags and making it through customs. And there’s the new reality: Airlines having to check passengers’ Covid tests, temperature and other health documents.</p> <p>The wait time has increased even though the volume of traffic is “only about 30 percent of pre-Covid-19 levels”, an IATA statement said.</p> <p>The sector lobby group warned that time spent in airports could swell to five hours and 30 minutes if traffic rebounds to 75 percent of its pre-pandemic level, and even longer “without process improvements”.</p> <p>The EU Digital Covid Certificate - showing whether a traveller was vaccinated, has immunity from a previous infection or passed a coronavirus test - will be rolled out on 1 July in an effort to make travel smoother within the 27-nation bloc.</p> <p>“The level of both uncertainty and complexity in planning for the restart is just mind blowing for now,” said the director general of the European branch of Airports Control International, Olivier Jankovec. His association represents 500 airports on the continent.</p> <p>“With each passing day, the prospect of travellers enduring widespread chaos at airports this summer is becoming more real.”</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-06-03T07:37:36.006Z\">at 8.37am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-60b881cf8f082e80569f4b23\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-03T07:17:07.855Z\">8.17am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Indonesia</strong> has cancelled the haj pilgrimage for people in the world’s largest Muslim-majority nation for a second year in a row due to concerns over the pandemic, the religious affairs minister said this morning.<br></p> <p>Reuters report that minister Yaqut Cholil Qoumas told a briefing that Saudi Arabia, where the pilgrimage takes place, had not opened access to the haj.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60b87f088f08b9889b367642\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-03T07:07:55.130Z\">8.07am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">UK government 'shortchanging children' in England on catch-up plans – Labour spokesperson</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In the UK, Labour’s opposition spokesperson <strong>James Murray</strong> has also been trailing round the TV and radio studios.

And so a lot of us have been talking about a 100-day target from the recognition from a virus with pandemic potential.”<br></p> <p>“It would mean that we would have had a vaccine in early April if that had happened this time, early April of 2020,” Lander said. “It makes you gulp for a second, but it’s totally feasible to do that.”</p> <p>He is the first director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy to be promoted to Cabinet level in a US administration.

In some areas local political leaders have retreated from public engagement on the issue, while in others, including Tuskegee, local leadership has played a vital role in pushing rates above the state average.</p> <p>Omar Neal, a local radio host and community leader, took his shot almost as soon as it was available. He weighed the heavy history but set aside what he described as instinctive distrust of public health systems after generations of failures.</p> <p>“Trust is a calculated risk,” he said, pausing for a moment. “Five hundred and eighty-eight thousand people have died because they didn’t get this vaccine.

I must say that I was one of those very sceptical about the Wuhan lab leak theory initially, as much of the evidence posted online that I saw seemed to amount to not much more than “They have a lab there, you know”.</p> <p>Former MI6 chief <strong>Sir Richard Dearlove</strong> possibly knows his onions a bit better than me, and he’s had some pretty stringent words about the origins of the virus on a podcast from the Telegraph, and PA have picked up the quotes this morning. He says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The People’s Republic of China is a pretty terrifying regime and does some things we consider unacceptable and extreme in silencing opposition to the official line of the government. We don’t know that’s what’s happened, but a lot of data have probably been destroyed or made to disappear so it’s going to be difficult to prove definitely the case for a ‘gain of function chimera’ being the cause of the pandemic.</p> </blockquote> <p>Trevor Marshallsea writes that Sir Richard said he felt some vindication as more people were beginning to take seriously his repeated questioning of the origins of the coronavirus. He spoke of “extraordinary behaviour” in the scientific community which had “shut down any debate” and which he said verged on “academic bullying”.</p> <p>China, he said, had originally been “let off the hook” on questions about the virus’s origins due to scepticism over the Trump administration, which had led such enquiries initially.</p> <p>He also said the West had been naive in trusting China, which had infiltrated scientific institutions and journals in the UK and elsewhere.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60b86ea28f082ac930ae8b9a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-03T05:55:57.349Z\">6.55am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The latest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2021/jun/03/the-wuhan-lab-leak-theory-podcast\">episode</a> of the Guardian’s Today In Focus podcast is exploring the Wuhan lab leak theory.</p> <p>When Covid-19 first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan, much of the focus of the initial investigation fell on a seafood market that also sold exotic animals for human consumption. But in the months since, no definitive link has been proven and the precise origin story remains unsolved.</p> <p>In the intervening period numerous conspiracy theories have spread: that somehow 5G phone signals could be involved, or that the virus is a hoax. Bracketed in with these was a theory that Covid-19 may have been released (accidentally or otherwise) from a lab.</p> <p>Initially scientists poured scorn on the lab leak theory but in recent months suspicion has fallen on the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which studies coronaviruses. As the Guardian’s <strong>Peter Beaumont </strong>tells <strong>Anushka Asthana</strong>,<strong> </strong>these suspicions are still being treated with scepticism by scientists. But now, in the absence of any other confirmed origin, Joe Biden has asked US intelligence agencies to consider the lab leak theory as a possibility and to investigate.

Reuters reports that the deal is the bloc’s first contract for this kind of drug, as it aims to identify 10 promising treatments by the end of the month amid a failure by pharmaceutical companies to swiftly deliver sufficient supplies of vaccines after initial promise. The deal with Roche was reached in April, the company told Reuters, but contract details were not made public. A European Commission spokesman said the EU had secured about 55,000 doses of the single-dose treatment. The only other anti-Covid drug the EU has bought is Gilead’s remdesivir, an antiviral medicine. Last year, the EU reserved half a million courses after the drug obtained a conditional EU approval. European countries would buy the Roche-Regeneron drug, which is composed of the monoclonal antibodies casirivimab and imdevimab, only after it was approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) or by national drug regulators. “The EU authorisation is expected between August and October 2021,” an EU document says, citing Roche estimates.

Hong Kong will open its vaccine scheme to children over the age of 12, as it pursues a broader campaign across the city to incentivise its 7.5 million residents to get vaccinated. The region started its vaccination programme in February but only around 14% of the population have been fully vaccinated so far. Another 17 people have died in Taiwan, where authorities reported 364 new local cases and 219 backlogged cases added to previous days’ totals. It brings Taiwan’s total death toll to 166, of which 154 have been since 15 May. Bulgaria plans to provide about 150,000 Covid vaccines to its Balkan neighbours, health minister Stoicho Katsarov has said. It has the lowest inoculation rates in the European Union, but Katsarov said the country has agreed to receive about 13m doses under the EU supply scheme by the end of the year and can afford to help other countries. “The idea is to distribute up to 150,000 doses among our neighbouring western Balkan countries,” Katsarov said, adding that Sofia has received requests from North Macedonia, Albania, Kosovo and Bosnia. A coronavirus variant which Vietnam authorities thought was a combination of the Indian and UK strains is not a new hybrid, but part of the existing Indian strain, the World Health Organization’s representative in Vietnam has said. The WHO in Nepal has also denied reports that there is a “Nepal variant” causing concern. Syria has received its first shipment of Russian Sputnik V vaccine. Syrian President Bashar Assad was inoculated with the vaccine, the Syrian ambassador to Moscow said. The Serum Institute of India has sought regulatory approval to make Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine, on top of the AstraZeneca and Novavax shots it is already producing. Indonesia has cancelled the haj pilgrimage for people in the world’s largest Muslim-majority nation for a second year in a row due to concerns over the pandemic. Infection rates in Germany continue to drop as the country slowly emerges from eight months of lockdown, but politicians are urging caution over a possible variant-driven resurgence at the end of the summer. Seiko Hashimoto, the president of the Tokyo 2020 organising committee has ruled out a cancellation or further postponement of the Olympics, amid concerns about hosting the event during a global pandemic. “We cannot postpone again,” she said in an interview And you might be interested in the latest episode of the Guardian’s Today In Focus podcast, exploring the Wuhan lab leak theory… Reuters have very handily – for me, if not for you – wrapped up exactly which countries in Europe are now allowing children and adolescents to be vaccinated. France will start vaccinating teenagers from age 12 on 15 June Germany plans to offer a first shot to children aged 12-16 from 7 June, while Poland would offer shots to those aged 12-15 the same day. Lithuania’s prime minister said the country could start vaccinating children from age 12 in June. Italy on 31 May approved extending the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to 12-15 year olds. Austria aims to have over 340,000 children aged 12-15 vaccinated by the end of August. Hungary started vaccinating 16-18-year-olds in mid-May. Switzerland’s health watchdog said in early May Pfizer had sought approval for its shot in children aged 12-15. San Marino on 1 June opened vaccinations for children aged 12-15. Infection rates in Germany continue to drop as the country slowly emerges from eight months of lockdown, but politicians are urging caution over a possible variant-driven resurgence at the end of the summer. The seven-day incidence of infections per 100,000 people over seven days dropped to 34.1 on Thursday, with 4,640 new infections reported by Germany’s disease control agency, the Robert Koch Institute. Social Democrat delegate Karl Lauterbach, a trained doctor and prominent health expert, said he expected the incidence rate to remain around 35 in the coming weeks, as people spent more time outdoors during the summer and more and more people were fully immunised. Some 53 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines have been administered in Germany so far, and 44.6% of the population has had at least one shot. Lauterbach said he expected the “Delta variant” of the virus that was first detected in India to become more dominant in Germany after the holidays, saying it “will probably spread around numerous European countries in the coming months”. For now, the Delta variant B1.617.2 only plays a minor role in Germany, making up 2.1 percent of cases reported over the last week. Nonetheless Germany is one of the European countries who have imposed restrictions on travel from the United Kingdom over the variant, with anyone entering Germany from the UK will be required quarantine for two weeks on arrival, even if they test negative for the coronavirus. Regular readers of this blog will know that I usually slightly raise one eyebrow when reporting the official numbers out of Russia as they are remarkably consistent. They’ve pretty much been in the range of 7,000 to 9,500 daily every day since early March, which feels unusual as it suggest the virus is neither gathering pace or diminishing, which tends not to be how epidemics behave. Today is no different, as Russia reported 8,933 new cases taking the official national tally since the pandemic began to 5,099,182. The government coronavirus task force said 393 people had died of coronavirus linked causes in the past 24 hours, pushing the national death toll to 122,660. Reuters always note that the federal statistics agency has kept a separate count and has said Russia recorded significantly more fatalities than that. They put the figure at around 250,000 deaths related to Covid from April 2020 to March 2021. My colleague Nicola Slawson has just opened up the UK live blog for the day – so if you are looking for UK Covid news, that’s where you need to head. I’ll be continuing here with global updates. Bulgaria plans to provide about 150,000 Covid vaccines to its Balkan neighbours, health minister Stoicho Katsarov has said. Bulgaria has the lowest inoculation rates in the European Union, but Katsarov said the country has agreed to receive about 13m doses under the EU supply scheme by the end of the year and can afford to help other countries. “The idea is to distribute up to 150,000 doses among our neighbouring western Balkan countries,” Katsarov told reporters, adding that Sofia has received requests from North Macedonia, Albania, Kosovo and Bosnia. “Our needs are fully covered so there is no danger whatsoever that Bulgaria can be left without vaccines,” he said. Reuters report Katsarov said he expects to receive an answer on Friday from the European Commission how exactly the country should proceed and whether it could donate or sell the doses. He said Bulgaria was looking to donate mostly AstraZeneca vaccines, not least because of the low interest in them at home. Last week president Rumen Radev said Sofia plans to donate a significant amount of vaccines to North Macedonia in a move that could help improve strained relations over Bulgaria’s veto on the start of EU accession talks with Skopje. A quick one from Sky here, that the reopening of indoor hospitality last month failed to boost footfall in town centres in England. The figures are compiled by a company called Springboard, and they said: May was the wettest on record which inevitably lowered the initial exhilaration of consumers in being able to eat out as even visiting indoor environments necessitated braving the weather. Secondly, the limitations on dining capacity in indoor venues inevitably means that the uplift in footfall generated has been limited; and thirdly most of the increase in footfall has occurred post 5pm when volumes of activity are far lower those than during retail trading hours. Footfall in May 2021 was around 25% down on the same pre-pandemic period in 2019 Hong Kong will open its vaccine scheme to children over the age of 12 for the first time, Reuters report, as it pursues a broader campaign across the city to incentivise its 7.5 million residents to get vaccinated. The region started its vaccination programme in February but only around 14% of the population have been fully vaccinated so far. Another 17 people have died in Taiwan, where authorities reported 364 new local cases and 219 backlogged cases added to previous days’ totals. It brings Taiwan’s total death toll to 166, of which 154 have been since 15 May. Taiwan’s worst outbreak since the pandemic began continues to report high daily numbers, but analyses of the general trend are tentatively suggesting a decline. Finding trends in the data has been made difficult during this outbreak, as a backlog of cases routinely adds dozens of cases to previous days. In its daily briefing today, the central epidemic command centre reported details of a growing outbreak in aged care, and a cluster among migrant workers in Miaoli county. Ahead of an upcoming long weekend, health and welfare minister Chen Chih-Shung urged people not to travel. Taiwan is on level 3 of a four tier alert system which does not stop people from traveling. Restrictions limit gatherings to 10 outside and five inside, restaurants are take-away only, and employers have been urged to facilitate working from home, although this has not been widely taken up. Another quick Reuters snap here, that Syria has received the first shipment of Russian Sputnik V vaccine. Syrian President Bashar Assad was inoculated with the vaccine, Syrian ambassador to Russia Riad Haddad said. Also on variants, Reuters report that a coronavirus variant which Vietnam authorities thought was a combination of the Indian and UK strains is not a new hybrid but part of the existing Indian strain, the World Health Organization’s representative in Vietnam told Nikkei. “There is no new hybrid variant in Vietnam at this moment based on WHO definition,” Kidong Park said in an online interview with the newspaper, adding that it was within the “Delta variation” that was first detected in India. In the UK today the Daily Mail is carrying a front page story warning of the threat from what they call a “Nepal variant”. The World Health Organization in Nepal have put out a tweet this morning saying that they aren’t aware of any such variant. One of things we are expecting today is for the UK government to announce if they are making any changes to the green, amber and red lists for international travel. A lot of people with hopes of a holiday or visiting loved ones abroad will have their eye closely on the situation – we might get that news around 11am this morning. Getting there may prove more of a headache than usual, as AFP report. A year after the coronavirus pandemic emptied airports, air travel associations fear chaos during Europe’s summer holiday season as travellers could wait hours before boarding planes due to health checks. Strict controls are still in place at most European airports even though vaccination campaigns are making progress and infection rates are falling. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) reported last week that on average, people travelling at peak times now stay twice as long at airports - three hours - compared with 2019. That time is generally spent checking in, passing security and immigration controls, picking up checked bags and making it through customs. And there’s the new reality: Airlines having to check passengers’ Covid tests, temperature and other health documents. The wait time has increased even though the volume of traffic is “only about 30 percent of pre-Covid-19 levels”, an IATA statement said. The sector lobby group warned that time spent in airports could swell to five hours and 30 minutes if traffic rebounds to 75 percent of its pre-pandemic level, and even longer “without process improvements”. The EU Digital Covid Certificate - showing whether a traveller was vaccinated, has immunity from a previous infection or passed a coronavirus test - will be rolled out on 1 July in an effort to make travel smoother within the 27-nation bloc. “The level of both uncertainty and complexity in planning for the restart is just mind blowing for now,” said the director general of the European branch of Airports Control International, Olivier Jankovec. His association represents 500 airports on the continent. “With each passing day, the prospect of travellers enduring widespread chaos at airports this summer is becoming more real.” Indonesia has cancelled the haj pilgrimage for people in the world’s largest Muslim-majority nation for a second year in a row due to concerns over the pandemic, the religious affairs minister said this morning. Reuters report that minister Yaqut Cholil Qoumas told a briefing that Saudi Arabia, where the pilgrimage takes place, had not opened access to the haj. In the UK, Labour’s opposition spokesperson James Murray has also been trailing round the TV and radio studios. On the proposals for catch-up funding for pupils in England, he told Sky News: I think everyone listening to the show will realise that what the government is doing by shortchanging children feels wrong, and it’s also the ultimate false economy. If we don’t invest in protecting our children now, and making sure that their education catches up, that they are prepared in terms of their mental wellbeing and so on, it’s going to cost the country and the economy dearly in the long run. Seth Borenstein, science writer at AP, reports that in the US, new White House science adviser Eric Lander wants to have a vaccine ready to fight the next pandemic in just about 100 days after recognizing a potential viral outbreak. In his first interview after being sworn in, he painted a rosy near future where a renewed American emphasis on science not only better prepares the world for the next pandemic with plug-and-play vaccines, but also changes how medicine fights disease and treats patients, curbs climate change and further explores space. “This is a moment in so many ways, not just health, that we can rethink fundamental assumptions about what’s possible and that’s true of climate and energy and many areas,” Lander told The Associated Press. “It was amazing at one level that we were able to produce highly effective vaccines in less than a year, but from another point of view you’d say, ‘Boy, a year’s a long time,”’ even though in the past it would take three years or four years, Lander said. “To really make a difference we want to get this done in 100 days. And so a lot of us have been talking about a 100-day target from the recognition from a virus with pandemic potential.” “It would mean that we would have had a vaccine in early April if that had happened this time, early April of 2020,” Lander said. “It makes you gulp for a second, but it’s totally feasible to do that.” He is the first director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy to be promoted to Cabinet level in a US administration. Lander said President Joe Biden’s elevation of the science post is a symbolic show “that science should have a seat at the table” but also allows him to have higher-level talks with different agency chiefs about making policy. A very quick Reuters snap here that the Serum Institute of India has sought regulatory approval to make Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine, on top of the AstraZeneca and Novavax shots it is already producing. In England, much of the news this morning has been dominated by the continued fall-out over the government’s plans for education “catch-up” spending. Yesterday Sir Kevan Collins quit, said to be dismayed that his long-awaited £15bn proposals were watered down to a £1.4bn package. Home Office minister Victoria Atkins has been out and about fronting up the government response, saying that the Government’s education recovery fund was “very much focused on what we can deliver and deliver quickly” Collins said in his resignation statement that the package of support is “too narrow, too small and will be delivered too slowly”. When asked on Sky News, Atkins said she had not read the resignation statement – which does seem somewhat extraordinary given that she’s been sent out this morning specifically to rebut it She told Sky News the Government was “continuing to look at things like lengthening the school day”. Meanwhile, PA report that senior Conservative MP Robert Halfon said the Government must “decide their priorities in terms of education” and that the Treasury can “find the money from the back of the sofa”, where there is the political will. The chairman of the Education Select Committee told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “Of course there are funding constraints but the Treasury announced over £16bn extra for defence only last year, we’ve got £800m being spent on a new research agency, £200m being spent on a yacht. “So where there is the political will, the Treasury can find the money from the back of the sofa, and there has to be that political will because we need a long-term plan for education, a proper funding settlement.” He said the damage caused by Covid-19 to younger children “has been nothing short of disastrous”. Oliver Laughland brings us a special report on vaccine hesitancy this morning from Tuskegee and Florala in the US: In 1997, President Bill Clinton apologized for the Tuskegee study, which he described as “clearly racist”. Two decades on, the legacy of what happened here has been routinely cited as a reason many Black Americans remain distrustful of the country’s medical systems and also the Covid-19 vaccine itself. It is then, perhaps, against expectation that vaccination rates in Macon county, where this city of 8,000 residents is situated, are substantially higher than the state average in Alabama. In Macon county, 36% of residents have now received their first shot compared with only 32% statewide. In this historic region of Black Belt counties, home to large populations of Black residents, some jurisdictions have completed vaccinations at rates of over 40%. But Alabama and the neighbouring state of Mississippi have for months had the lowest vaccination rates in the country, with vaccine hesitancy underwritten by different forces in various locations across the state. In some areas local political leaders have retreated from public engagement on the issue, while in others, including Tuskegee, local leadership has played a vital role in pushing rates above the state average. Omar Neal, a local radio host and community leader, took his shot almost as soon as it was available. He weighed the heavy history but set aside what he described as instinctive distrust of public health systems after generations of failures. “Trust is a calculated risk,” he said, pausing for a moment. “Five hundred and eighty-eight thousand people have died because they didn’t get this vaccine. Nobody died that did take it. That’s pretty good odds for me.” Read more of Oliver Laughland’s report here: Alabama faces vaccine hesitancy but only some counties try to tackle it A five-pronged approach focused on the five C’s - confidence, complacency, convenience, communication and context - is needed to combat vaccine hesitancy, according to scientists from the UK, US and South Africa. PA report that writing in the Royal Society of Medicine journal, they say complacency due to lower perceptions of personal risk and disease severity, particularly among younger people and those of lower socioeconomic status, is strongly associated with lower vaccine uptake. One of the authors, Dr Mohammad Razai, of the Population Health Research Institute at St George’s, University of London, said: “As the lower age groups are being offered the vaccine, addressing complacency through repeated risk communication is crucial to facilitate informed decision-making. “It is important to emphasise the greater societal benefits of population level immunity and the protection it offers to those vulnerable, their families and friends.” The proposed strategy also focuses on convenience of vaccination delivery, communication to combat misinformation, and recognition of context including ethnicity, religion, occupation and socioeconomic status. Confidence in vaccine safety, efficacy and importance is crucial, and the public needs to be aware that for most people the benefits of vaccine “vastly outweigh the risk” of rare side effects, they write. Getting Alan Sugar to endorse the vaccine for young people was probably not on their list of priorities, but he’s done that on social media this morning in his own imitable style. Workers in Melbourne in Australia who haven’t had shifts due to the extended Covid lockdown will be eligible for up to $500 in support after the prime minister announced a new temporary Covid disaster payment. Scott Morrison said on Thursday the disaster payment would be available in areas declared a commonwealth hotspot when any lockdown lasted longer than seven days. A $500 weekly payment will be available for people who work more than 20 hours a week while $325 will be available for those who work less than that. The support will only go to people older than 17, who were working before the lockdown and who can no longer work. They will need to have less than $10,000 in savings. There are further restrictions including whether other leave – beyond annual and sick leave – is available to cover the lockdown period. Good morning, it is Martin Belam here in London taking over for the next few hours. I must say that I was one of those very sceptical about the Wuhan lab leak theory initially, as much of the evidence posted online that I saw seemed to amount to not much more than “They have a lab there, you know”. Former MI6 chief Sir Richard Dearlove possibly knows his onions a bit better than me, and he’s had some pretty stringent words about the origins of the virus on a podcast from the Telegraph, and PA have picked up the quotes this morning. He says: The People’s Republic of China is a pretty terrifying regime and does some things we consider unacceptable and extreme in silencing opposition to the official line of the government. We don’t know that’s what’s happened, but a lot of data have probably been destroyed or made to disappear so it’s going to be difficult to prove definitely the case for a ‘gain of function chimera’ being the cause of the pandemic. Trevor Marshallsea writes that Sir Richard said he felt some vindication as more people were beginning to take seriously his repeated questioning of the origins of the coronavirus. He spoke of “extraordinary behaviour” in the scientific community which had “shut down any debate” and which he said verged on “academic bullying”. China, he said, had originally been “let off the hook” on questions about the virus’s origins due to scepticism over the Trump administration, which had led such enquiries initially. He also said the West had been naive in trusting China, which had infiltrated scientific institutions and journals in the UK and elsewhere. The latest episode of the Guardian’s Today In Focus podcast is exploring the Wuhan lab leak theory. When Covid-19 first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan, much of the focus of the initial investigation fell on a seafood market that also sold exotic animals for human consumption. But in the months since, no definitive link has been proven and the precise origin story remains unsolved. In the intervening period numerous conspiracy theories have spread: that somehow 5G phone signals could be involved, or that the virus is a hoax. Bracketed in with these was a theory that Covid-19 may have been released (accidentally or otherwise) from a lab. Initially scientists poured scorn on the lab leak theory but in recent months suspicion has fallen on the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which studies coronaviruses. As the Guardian’s Peter Beaumont tells Anushka Asthana, these suspicions are still being treated with scepticism by scientists. But now, in the absence of any other confirmed origin, Joe Biden has asked US intelligence agencies to consider the lab leak theory as a possibility and to investigate. So how seriously should we take it? In Australia, Melbourne GPs say they are being forced to turn away huge numbers of vaccine-seeking locals, including busloads of vulnerable residents from care facilities, because the commonwealth’s supply of doses has not increased to match the explosion in demand. The latest outbreak has caused a huge increase in demand for the Covid-19 vaccine in Victoria, and the state is now recording daily vaccination numbers of above 20,000 in primary care, up from the roughly 2,300 doses administered on 24 May. The demand has inundated local GPs, who say their supplies of vaccine doses are evaporating almost immediately. Seiko Hashimoto, the president of the Tokyo 2020 organising committee has ruled out a cancellation or further postponement of the Olympics, amid concerns about hosting the event during a global pandemic. “We cannot postpone again,” she said in an interview with Nikkan Sports newspaper. Reuters reports: Public opinion polls in Japan have consistently shown that a majority want the Games cancelled or put off yet again after being delayed by one year because of the coronavirus crisis. A majority of the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly feel the same way, the Tokyo Shimbun newspaper reported on Thursday. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga is likely to call a snap election after the Olympic and Paralympic Games, the Asahi newspaper reported, showing his resolve to push ahead with the event. Towns and cities lined up to host Olympic training or events have increasingly expressed resistance, amid concern visitors will spread variant strains of the virus and drain medical resources. The government of Ota City has been inundated with complaints by residents over a decision to give preferential Covid-19 vaccinations to city and hotel staff tending to Australian athletes, media reported. While Japan has avoided the large-scale infections suffered by many other nations, severe cases are rising in the latest outbreak. More than 746,000 cases have been recorded and more than 13,000 deaths. Shigeru Omi, Japan’s top medical adviser, told a parliamentary committee on Wednesday that it was “not normal” to host the Olympics amid the current state of infections. Reuters: Pot-banging protests erupted across several cities in Brazil last night, as President Jair Bolsonaro addressed the nation, Reuters reports. It occurred just days after protestors took to the streets across the country over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which has so far killed almost half a million people. The last few days have been rocky for the government of the right-wing leader, whose popularity had already been flagging amid persistently high daily Covid-19 deaths and cases. On Wednesday alone, almost 100,000 Brazilians came down with the coronavirus and 2,507 died, according to government data. Earlier in the day, the nation’s Supreme Court authorised a criminal investigation into Bolsonaro’s environment minister for allegedly interfering with a police probe into illegal logging. In the televised speech, Bolsonaro briefly summarised some of his government’s recent accomplishments and pledged strong economic growth going forward, but presented no new information. On Saturday, thousands participated in protests in at least 16 cities across the country, which were organised by leftist political parties, unions and student associations. In Sao Paulo, Brazil’s largest city, thousands of mask-wearing people blocked one the largest city’s avenues, while a large balloon depicted Bolsonaro as a vampire. Some protests, like the one in Rio de Janeiro, included images of former leftist president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who has emerged as Bolsonaro’s main challenger in the nation’s 2022 election, wearing the presidential sash. In the brief Wednesday evening speech, Bolsonaro, who has ridiculed masks and vaccines in the past, said all Brazilians who wanted a vaccine would be able to get one by the end of the year. Also in the evening, the nation’s Health Ministry revised down the number of Covid-19 vaccines it will receive in June by about 4 million doses. Hello and welcome to our continuing coverage of the global pandemic. Here is a short update of developments in the last 24 hours In the US Joe Biden has announced a “national month of action” to get 70% of Americans vaccinated. Meanwhile in Australia, doctors in Melbourne say they have had to turn away patients because they don’t have enough vaccines to meet demand. The pandemic has pushed more than 100 million more workers into poverty, the UN has said. Cancellation or another postponement of the Tokyo Olympic Games has been ruled out by the head of the organising committee. France will start vaccinating teenagers from age 12 with the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine on June 15, the government said. Mexico reported 3,269 new cases of Covid-19 in the country and 306 more fatalities, Reuters reports. It brings the total to 2,423,928 infections and 228,146 deaths, according to health ministry data released on Wednesday. Spanish regions with a low Covid infection rate will be allowed to reopen nightlife before herd immunity is achieved, which is expected by mid-August, the health minister said. The Canadian province of Ontario will keep schools closed for in-person learning until the new school year starts in September, premier Doug Ford announced. Germany plans to pay vaccine manufacturers an annual reservation fee to build up reserve capacity of around 600-700m doses per year to help it fight future pandemics, the health minister said. Colombia has began what its government called a gradual opening of its border with Venezuela after a 14-month closure intended to curb the spread of the coronavirus. In Germany, the Robert Koch Institute has confirmed that a third wave of the virus has been broken. EU governments have agreed to add Japan to their small list of countries from which they will allow non-essential travel, it was reported earlier.","charCount":"31624","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a> (now) and <a href=\"profile/helen-davidson\">Helen Davidson</a> (earlier)"},{"headline":"Superannuation bill passes lower house after Coalition dumps controversial ‘kill switch’","standfirst":"<p>Barnaby Joyce had ‘real concerns’ provision would have allowed future Labor government to cancel investments in fossil fuels</p>","trailText":"Barnaby Joyce had ‘real concerns’ provision would have allowed future Labor government to cancel investments in fossil fuels","byline":"Paul Karp","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"957a94ac47fa3b4a95b27bad6a9b3b60c0e30350\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/957a94ac47fa3b4a95b27bad6a9b3b60c0e30350/0_0_5010_3006/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The member for Hughes Craig Kelly and the member for New England Barnaby Joyce\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Super bill passes after amendments prompted by a revolt from Nationals MP Barnaby Joyce, right, and now independent MP Craig Kelly, left.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>The Morrison government has dumped the controversial “kill switch” from its superannuation reforms that would have allowed it to veto certain types of investment decisions by super funds.</p> <p>On Thursday the Your Future Your Super bill passed the lower house, but only after the Coalition moved amendments prompted by a revolt from Nationals MP Barnaby Joyce and former Liberal turned independent MP Craig Kelly.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/oct/06/australia-federal-budget-2020-super-funds-frydenberg\">the October budget the Coalition proposed the reforms</a> to “staple” superannuation members to the first fund they join to prevent account duplication, and create new performance measures that could bar underperforming funds from accepting new members.</p> <p>The bill, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/oct/12/labor-signals-fight-over-massive-design-fault-of-super-changes-in-coalition-budget\">which is opposed by Labor</a>, is most controversial for a proposal to give the government power to make regulations deeming that certain forms of spending and investment are banned because they are not in members’ best interests.</p> <p>The powers would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/nov/29/new-super-rules-how-coalition-changes-will-wrap-industry-funds-in-red-tape\">allow the Coalition to ban industry super funds</a> from giving money to news website the New Daily or investing in political campaigns such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/mar/19/industry-superannuation-funds-go-on-attack-with-banks-arent-super-ad\">a famous series of ads</a> depicting banks as foxes wanting to be in charge of the henhouse of Australians’ retirement savings.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/may/11/australia-federal-budget-2021-super-changes-superannuation-funds-retirement-savings-repeal-work-test-retired-pensioners-pension-loans-scheme\">Budget superannuation changes: ‘work test’ scrapped for some older Australians and downsizer scheme extended</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/feb/23/craig-kelly-quits-liberal-party-to-move-to-the-crossbench\">he quit the Liberal party in February</a>, Kelly dissented on the bill.

On Thursday the Your Future Your Super bill passed the lower house, but only after the Coalition moved amendments prompted by a revolt from Nationals MP Barnaby Joyce and former Liberal turned independent MP Craig Kelly. In the October budget the Coalition proposed the reforms to “staple” superannuation members to the first fund they join to prevent account duplication, and create new performance measures that could bar underperforming funds from accepting new members. The bill, which is opposed by Labor, is most controversial for a proposal to give the government power to make regulations deeming that certain forms of spending and investment are banned because they are not in members’ best interests. The powers would allow the Coalition to ban industry super funds from giving money to news website the New Daily or investing in political campaigns such as a famous series of ads depicting banks as foxes wanting to be in charge of the henhouse of Australians’ retirement savings. After he quit the Liberal party in February, Kelly dissented on the bill. He has moved amendments proposing to delay the reforms by one year, to start in July 2022, and exempting high-risk industries from stapling. On Wednesday, Joyce revealed in parliament he had “real concerns” with the kill switch provision, warning that a future Labor government could use it to cancel investments in coal, gas, fracking and the live cattle trade. After talks between Joyce and the superannuation minister, Jane Hume, on Wednesday evening, the government circulated amendments on Thursday removing the kill switch. The bill passed on Thursday afternoon 66 votes to 62, as the backdown also secured the votes of crossbench MPs Rebekha Sharkie and Bob Katter. Sharkie told the house the bill “addresses many of the deficiencies in the current legislation that have a concerning effect on retirement incomes”. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning But Sharkie warned more needed to be done to prevent workers being stapled to underperforming funds, such as “sequencing to eliminate poor-performing funds before the stapling scheme commences”. Sharkie suggested such an amendment should be considered “very carefully” in the Senate, where Centre Alliance has one vote, Stirling Griff. The bill’s fate in the Senate is still unclear – as Pauline Hanson’s One Nation’s greatest objection to the bill may also have been overcome; but independent Rex Patrick will move amendments about dangerous occupations and the best financial interests of members. The shadow assistant treasurer, Stephen Jones, told Guardian Australia the super bill was “half-baked” and the government had already made three major changes: to count administration fees when benchmarking funds; to remove disincentives to invest in Australian infrastructure and agriculture; and to remove the kill switch. Jones said changes to the bill had been “pretty humiliating” for the government and the kill switch in particular “runs against every principle of liberal and conservative philosophy” to allow a minister power to “cancel private sector investment”. Jones suggested the bill could be further improved by delaying the commencement of stapling until benchmarking is complete, or simply providing that workers cannot be stapled to underperforming funds. “If a fund is so bad no new member can join – why allow other workers to be stapled to it?” Hume told Guardian Australia the government had “agreed to minor changes to the bill” following consultation with the crossbench in the lower house and Senate. “The changes do not undermine the policy intent or effect of these reforms, which will see Australians better off by $17.9 billion over the next 10 years,” she said. “We look forward to continuing our conversations with the crossbench to ensure its passage through the Senate.”","charCount":"4053","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/paul-karp\">Paul Karp</a>"},{"headline":"The media is still mostly failing to convey the urgency of the climate crisis","standfirst":"<p>We asked the world’s press to commit to treating climate change as the emergency that scientists say it is.

This crime, for which no one was convicted, was one of the most severe single instances of racial violence in the history of the United States, and is finally being openly discussed after decades of national silence.</p> <p>With this renewed attention should come more than just news coverage and speeches. African Americans must be paid reparations – for the money and lives stolen by this country as a whole, for the crime of Tulsa and for the long list of violent acts that the United States was built upon. Reparations would not undo the injustices of the past – or the modern violence of budget cuts, housing discrimination, mass incarceration and mass policing – but it would at least signal a turning point, while greatly improving the lives of a people deeply wronged by a system that could hardly exist without them.</p> <p>It is some form of progress that after so many years, the crime committed against the Black residents of Tulsa, Oklahoma, is finally being recognized on such a grand scale. Media outlets across the political spectrum have dedicated airtime and headlines to the anniversary. President Biden proclaimed a national day of remembrance and laid out the details of his plan to close the racial wealth gap in the country – though his plans reek more of Nixonian fetishization of “Black Capitalism” than of reparations. And the city of Tulsa, which began its path towards reconciliation in 1997 with a <a href=\"https://www.okhistory.org/research/forms/freport.pdf\">commission</a> dedicated to the atrocity, has commemorated the event with the <a href=\"https://www.blackwallstreetlegacyfest.com/\">Black Wall Street Legacy Festival</a>. The commission, composed of historians and political representatives, <a href=\"https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/tulsa-race-massacre-survivors-are-fighting-reparations-100-years-later-n1268891\">recommended</a> that the state of Oklahoma pay reparations in the form of scholarships and direct payments, but the descendants of Tulsa have still not received their due.</p> <p>The justification for reparations here is clear: Black residents of the city were killed and had their homes and businesses burned to the ground, robbing many of their lives and their descendants of a chance at developing the long-term generational wealth of their white peers. According to a 2020 <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/05/29/case-reparations-tulsa-oklahoma#_Toc41573968\">report</a> by the Human Rights Watch, the poverty rate for Black Tulsans is more than double that of white residents.

This crime, for which no one was convicted, was one of the most severe single instances of racial violence in the history of the United States, and is finally being openly discussed after decades of national silence. With this renewed attention should come more than just news coverage and speeches. African Americans must be paid reparations – for the money and lives stolen by this country as a whole, for the crime of Tulsa and for the long list of violent acts that the United States was built upon. Reparations would not undo the injustices of the past – or the modern violence of budget cuts, housing discrimination, mass incarceration and mass policing – but it would at least signal a turning point, while greatly improving the lives of a people deeply wronged by a system that could hardly exist without them. It is some form of progress that after so many years, the crime committed against the Black residents of Tulsa, Oklahoma, is finally being recognized on such a grand scale. Media outlets across the political spectrum have dedicated airtime and headlines to the anniversary. President Biden proclaimed a national day of remembrance and laid out the details of his plan to close the racial wealth gap in the country – though his plans reek more of Nixonian fetishization of “Black Capitalism” than of reparations. And the city of Tulsa, which began its path towards reconciliation in 1997 with a commission dedicated to the atrocity, has commemorated the event with the Black Wall Street Legacy Festival. The commission, composed of historians and political representatives, recommended that the state of Oklahoma pay reparations in the form of scholarships and direct payments, but the descendants of Tulsa have still not received their due. The justification for reparations here is clear: Black residents of the city were killed and had their homes and businesses burned to the ground, robbing many of their lives and their descendants of a chance at developing the long-term generational wealth of their white peers. According to a 2020 report by the Human Rights Watch, the poverty rate for Black Tulsans is more than double that of white residents. The report also stated: The effects of the Greenwood massacre and subsequent discrimination continue to be felt in the present day. Black neighborhoods remain underdeveloped and under resourced. Mistrust of police is a legacy of the massacre. Aggressive policing in the present serves as a reminder and even an extension of the past.

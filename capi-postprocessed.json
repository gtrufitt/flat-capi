Stephens holds serve to draw level in the second set. Muchova has tightened up her game and is making life much tougher for Stephens now. The American puts a backhand into the net for deuce in the sixth game of the second set. Following a washout at Lord’s yesterday, it’s game on in St John’s Wood this morning in the first England v New Zealand Test match. Tim de Lisle is covering the action here: It’s been extremely high-quality tennis here, so much so, it’s a big surprise when Muchova tamely finds the net with a backhand from the baseline. That makes it 30-30 and it’s a chance for Stephens: but now the American puts a shot of her own into the net from the back of the court for 40-30 to Muchova. Muchova closes out the game and it’s 3-2 to the Czech in the second set. Muchova now advances to the net and produced a lovely angled drop, then smacks a backhanded winner for 30-0. She’s on top right now. Stephens answers back, dispatching a fine backhand winner on a short ball. She’s done it! Stephens chases down a drop shot, opening up the right of the court, and Muchova passes to break back! Great point, and a great game. It’s 2-2 in the second set and Muchova is back in it! Muchova is noticeably timing the ball a lot better in the last few games, really starting to get a feel for it. Muchova gets it wrong again. She’s had four break points so far in this match and converted none of them. Now, here’s a fifth ... can she do it? Now, a chance for Muchova to break back ... she gains advantage on Stephens’ serve, but then inexplicably sends a forehand well wide. But next up, Muchova digs out a stunning volley at the net for another break point! On Court Philippe-Chatrier, the fifth seed Svitolina has started her match against Krejcikova. Schwartzman leads Kohlschreiber 3-1 in their second set (the Argentinian also won the first set, 6-4), while Musetti is 4-3 up on Cecchinato in that second set. A perfectly-judged drop shot from Muchova and she’s on the board in the second set, at 2-1 to Stephens. Stephens has fallen down the rankings of late - according to the commentators, in fact, she won just four matches throughout the whole of 2020 - but this performance has been well above her current ranking of 59 in the world. Muchova hasn’t played badly but Stephens has exerted control with every area of her game. Stephens holds comfortably for 2-0 in the second set. Muchova is very much second best here. Muchova has won just one out of 11 points when she’s come to the net, so she probably needs to rethink that tactic. Muchova sends a forehand long, after another entertaining rally, to seal a Stephens break at the start of the first set! Trouble for Muchova. Schwartzman wins the first set against Kohlschreiber, 6-4. Stephens wins the first set, 6-3! This has been a really interesting and engaging contest: Muchova has been mixing things up with a few clever drop shots, but Stephens has generally been in the ascendancy, taking every advantage with her accomplished forehand and showing ability to dictate the terms of many of the rallies from the baseline. Muchova moves to 40-0 on her serve, including a drop shot that flicks off the net cord (Muchova raising a hand by way of apology), and a lob which Stephens decided not to play but drops just inside the tramlines. Muchova then seals a love hold with another drop shot - and the American Stephens will serve for the first set at 5-3. Schwartzman is really making Kohlschreiber work to hold serve in that first set, but the German finally does it, and it’s 5-4 to the Argentinian who will try to serve it out now. Cecchinato wins his first set against Musetti, 6-3. The Stephens forehand is causing Muchova plenty of issues. The American earns a second advantage - and wins the game when the Czech sends a volley long. The umpire gets out of his seat and jogs to the back of the court to check the mark, raises his finger in confirmation, and it’s 5-2 to Stephens in this very engaging first set. Muchova takes it deuce on Stephens’ serve. Muchova then wins a break point with a fine, powerful forehand into the corner on her opponent’s backhand side. But Stephens then saves the break point with a big forehand of her own which Muchova can only dump in the net. On court, Stephens and Muchova both hold serve, and it’s 4-2 in the first set. Kohlschreiber is serving to stay in the first set against Schwartman at 3-5. Sloane Stephens has had a terribly tough year, having lost two grandparents and an aunt to Covid-19, and has said that she wishes she had attended her grandparents’ funeral instead of being in isolation ahead of the Australian Open: “I should have asked to go to my grandparents’ funeral,” she told the New York Times earlier this week. “I should have made those inquiries and seen if I could get out of the bubble and go home. I didn’t. It’s something that I’ll probably regret for the rest of my life, because I prioritized my tennis over things that were happening in my life. The only thing I can do now is move on and move forward. There’s nothing wrong with having a therapist or two and a grief counselor and all of these things. I have to do what’s best for me and work on myself.” Schwartzman has broken Kohlschreiber, to go 4-2 up, and now Stephens breaks Muchova for 3-1 in the first set! Elsewhere in the men’s singles, Marco Cecchinato is 4-2 up on Lorenzo Musetti on Court 7. Stephens wins a break point with a lovely sliced backhand down the line. Muchova saves it with a delicate (and brave) drop shot - a much better effort than her previous one. Stephens is seeing it - and hitting it - remarkably well. She wrests control of a rally with a booming backhand, crosscourt, and finishes off the point in style. She is dictating the terms more often than not. Schwartzman and Kohlschreiber are under way on Suzanne Lenglen and it’s 2-2 in the first set. Stephens wins four points in a row to hold her second service game, and it’s 2-1 in the American’s favour against Muchova. Muchova finally manages to hold: she had to work for that, and this is shaping up to be a closely-fought - and very entertaining - affair. 1-1. Muchova tries a drop shot for the first time but Stephens runs it down easily and puts away a forehand winner. Back to deuce. Muchova is now having to work to hold her first service game. Stephens takes it to deuce after a marathon rally, both players hitting wonderfully well early in this match. Muchova grabs advantage, but Stephens stays aliver with an excellent forehand on to Muchova’s toes as the Czech comes forward, and she can only direct it into the net. Sloane Stephens holds serve against Karolina Muchova to begin their third-round match. It was an interesting first game, with both players hitting the ball sweetly and powerfully. Muchova produced one brilliant clean backhanded winner on Stephens’ second serve, but Stephens generally had the best of the rallies and she is on the board in solid style. Here is Tumaini Carayol’s report from yesterday, including Serena Williams’ win against Danielle Collins, as well as Aryna Sabalenka’s defeat by Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova: Sloane Stephens v Karolina Muchova (seeded 18) is first up on Court Simonne Mathieu, a match I will focus on to begin with.

Reuters reports that the couple, who met in 2016 at a clinic where Eniko was working and Marton was then a trainee, say the emotional rollercoaster of the past 18 months has been draining but has made their relationship stronger. Eniko told the news agency: Because of the pandemic, we had to replan our wedding for the third time; both its date and the venue. The pandemic has also had a serious mental and physical affect on my fiancé as he is an ambulance officer. Reuters reports that the couple held a civil ceremony a month ago and are preparing for a wedding party with more than 100 guests in the town of Makó, near the Romanian border. Eniko is from Transylvania and many of her relatives will cross to Hungary to attend. They have been rehearsing their waltz for the wedding night, after a photo shoot on a motor boat on the Danube. Eniko said: Before, I thought my main worries would be whether we manage the lift in the dance, whether my makeup and hair would look good. But now, I am just happy and hope that all the guests and relatives can make it in health and we can celebrate together. Many couples are relieved that with 53% of Hungarians vaccinated, they can now go ahead and get married, Reuters reports. Gabor Herendi, a wedding planner, usually handles 30 to 35 weddings a year. But, in 2020, about 70% were postponed to this year. After the long wait, “energies will be multiplied”, he said. Hawaii will drop its quarantine and testing requirements for travellers once 70% of the state’s population has been vaccinated, the Associated Press reports, citing the governor, David Ige. The state will also lift its requirement that people wear masks indoors once that level has been reached. The state health department website said 59% of Hawaii’s population had had at least one dose of a vaccine and 52% had finished their dosing regimen. The AP reports: The state is using its figures, and not those provided by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to calculate thresholds for lifting restrictions. The health department director, Dr Libby Char, said that’s because Hawaii’s numbers are more accurate. She said it appeared the CDC had been counting some of Hawaii’s doses twice. Right now, travellers arriving from out of state must spend 10 days in quarantine or, to bypass that quarantine, they must show proof of a negative test taken before departure for the islands. Once 60% of Hawaii’s population is vaccinated, Ige said, the state will allow travellers to bypass a quarantine requirement as long as they can prove they were vaccinated in the US. Restrictions on travel between the islands will open up before that. Ige said that as of 15 June, people will be able to fly inter-island without taking a test or showing proof of vaccination. Also on that date, those who have been vaccinated in Hawaii may bypass quarantine when returning from a trip out of state. Russia has reported 9,145 new cases, including 2,897 in Moscow, taking the official national tally since the pandemic began to 5,117,274. According to Reuters, the government’s taskforce said 399 people had died in the past 24 hours, pushing the national death toll to 123,436. Taiwan has reported 511 new domestic cases, including 35 cases added to totals for recent days. That is up from the 472 domestic infections reported on Friday, Reuters reports. The agency also reports that Taiwan is in talks with US companies about making their vaccines, following similar talks with European firms, citing the health minister Chen Shih-chung. Taiwan, like much of the world, has been trying to speed up its vaccination programme following a spike in domestic cases, but has been stymied by global supply shortages. Chen told reporters that they previously had talks with European companies he did not name about producing their vaccines under licence. “Only recently have we started to have talks with US companies to see if it’s possible or not to carry out relevant subcontracting work,” he added, without providing details. Taiwan has ordered around 5m shots from the US firm Moderna, of which 150,000 have arrived. It has ordered 10m shots from the British-Swedish firm AstraZeneca. Taiwan, also in talks with BioNTech, blames China – which claims the island as its own territory – for blocking a deal with the German company earlier this year. Johnson &amp; Johnson said on Friday it had been in talks with Taiwan about providing its vaccine since last year. The number of confirmed cases in Germany increased by 2,294 to 3,697,927, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) shows, while the reported death toll has risen by 122 to 89,148. Mexico recorded 206 more deaths on Friday, bringing the total death toll to 228,568, its health ministry has said. Separate government data recently published suggests the real death toll may be at least 60% above the confirmed figure, Reuters has reported. Victoria, Australia’s second most populous state, has reported a small increase in locally acquired cases, as authorities hunt for the source of a new cluster of a highly infectious variant. Reuters reports: Five new local cases were reported, taking Victoria’s total to 70 in the latest outbreak, as the state capital, Melbourne, entered its second weekend of a hard lockdown, due to end on 10 June. Curbs were eased for the rest of the state on Friday. Saturday’s count was up from four new locally acquired cases on Friday. Authorities were alarmed after detecting the highly infectious Delta variant for the first time in Melbourne, sparking concerns cases could surge. There are now seven known cases in the city. The Delta variant, which has been classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as among the four variants of concern due to evidence that it spreads more easily, probably caused the latest devastating outbreak in India. Snap lockdowns, regional border restrictions and strict social distancing rules have helped Australia rein in prior outbreaks and keep its numbers relatively low at just 30,150 cases and 910 deaths. Victoria’s outbreak, which began on 24 May, has spurred people to join long queues for vaccinations following a slow rollout since February. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, said 20% of the adult population had now had a first dose of a vaccine. India’s capital city is preparing to deal with an infection peak of 37,000 cases a day in future, its chief minister has said, as the country as a whole reports 120,529 new cases over the last 24 hours. According to the Reuters agency, New Delhi’s political leader Arvind Kejriwal announced a partial easing of a lockdown, while the city is also preparing for oxygen storage capacity of 420 tons, and will set up genome sequencing labs to study coronavirus variants. Citing the federal health ministry, the agency reported 3,380 more deaths across India in 24 hours and said the tally of infections stood at 28.69 million and the death toll at 344,082.","charCount":"7174","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/kevin-rawlinson\">Kevin Rawlinson</a>"},{"headline":"England v New Zealand: first Test, day four – live!","standfirst":"<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2021/jun/05/yorkshire-v-sussex-glamorgan-v-lancs-and-more-county-cricket-live\">County cricket – live!

Another for Riewoldt and six for Richmond and Jumping Jack rocks back from about 50 out and bisects the middle. Huge tackle from Aarts, and repeat involvement from Houli, set it all up. Q2: 12 mins remaining: Essendon 2-3 (15) vs Richmond 5-5 (35) McGrath looks done for the night with a knee injury. Big blow for the Bombers. Cox takes a well-judged mark, cops one late from Vlastuin for his troubles, but can’t finish the job as his set shot misses to the left. At the other end, and boy did the ball move fast, Riewoldt hits the post with a left-foot snap. Q2: 16 mins remaining: Essendon 2-2 (14) vs Richmond 5-4 (34) Richmond goal! Fast break by the Tigers and a searching ball to a dangerous spot is gobbled up by Coleman-Jones, who seals the deal with an assured finish. Q2: 17 mins remaining: Essendon 2-2 (14) vs Richmond 4-4 (28) Essendon goal! The Bombers rebound and they catch the Tiges unawares with some swift ball movement as Hooker fairly well outmarks three defenders before splitting the big sticks in a much-needed goal. There are already 55,000 people in the stadium. Biggest crowd of the year at Optus. Q2: 19 mins remaining: Essendon 1-2 (8) vs Richmond 4-4 (28) Michael Long just got interviewed on the telly. We are not worthy. The Tigers look set to start with another goal but a timely touch on the line makes it only a sixth as bad. All Richmond, really. The Tigers dominated possession in the first quarter and that led to a glut of inside-50s. The weight of numbers told in the end and Essendon have some work to do. Q1: 1 min remaining: Essendon 1-2 (8) vs Richmond 4-3 (27) Richmond goal! Mc-T has a bit of a fumble in the middle of the ground, but Chol then matches him, and the quarter looks to be petering out before a chaos ball inside 50 hits the chest of Riewoldt, who rocks back and converts. Big first quarter from Richmond. Q1: 2 mins remaining: Essendon 1-2 (8) vs Richmond 3-3 (21) Laverde’s rushed kick forward is snaffled by Chol, who is having one heck of a quarter - maybe he is a first-choice ruckman - but his disposal lets him down and Essendon have a chance to reboot. Lovely looking set shot from Parish almost on the boundary but it fades to the right. Q1: 5 mins remaining: Essendon 1-1 (7) vs Richmond 3-3 (21) Richmond goal! The Tigers are cutting Essendon to shreds in the middle - far too easy in the corridor - and Castagna slots one home after marking, unmarked if you don’t mind, 35 metres out from goal directly in front. Q1: 8 mins remaining: Essendon 1-1 (7) vs Richmond 2-2 (14) Essendon goal! The Bombers are away as Ham gets a slice of the action, marking strongly inside 50 and Ham-mering it home with an assured kick from (free) range. Just as well he didn’t shave the post and instead put it through the middle. Q1: 10 mins remaining: Essendon 0-1 (1) vs Richmond 2-2 (14) The Bombers get the ball not only inside 50 but onto the chest of a leading forward. Jones has a good chance to kickstart his team’s night but it’s a horrible shank that still manages to register a behind. By the by, Martin has changed his boots. Bigger moulds? Q1: 12 mins remaining: Essendon 0-0 (0) vs Richmond 2-2 (14) Richmond goal! Chol finds himself with time and space at centre half-forward - he’s off to a blinder - and a pinpoint pass finds Martin, who does what Martin does. The rest. Big start by the Tiges. Q1: 14 mins remaining: Essendon 0-0 (0) vs Richmond 1-2 (8) Ripping tackle by Redman on Aarts saves Essendon’s bacon in the right forward pocket. The Dons might want to start possessing the ball, however! Q1: 15 mins remaining: Essendon 0-0 (0) vs Richmond 1-2 (8) Richmond Goal! Coleman-Jones gets manhandled in the square and it’s an easy conversion from there. First goal of the game. All Richmond so far. Killing it in the middle and Essendon can’t get their hands on it. Q1: 17 mins remaining: Essendon 0-0 (0) vs Richmond 0-2 (2) Dusty gets his hands on it in the centre and he finds Riewoldt on the chest - how many times have we seen that?! - but the entry inside-50 is a bit off and it’s anyone’s ball before Prestia has a rushed snap that misses to the left. Q1: 19 mins remaining: Essendon 0-0 (0) vs Richmond 0-1 (1) And we are away. Straight out of the middle by Richmond and Chol goes long. Could’ve been a goal in about as many seconds but he misses to the right. TWELVE snags!!!!!!!!! The Crows have been fined a hefty amount - hefty in the sense that it will come from their football department soft cap - for what can only be described as an act of rank stupidity. 100% The Dons haven’t beaten Richmond since round 11, 2014. If you don’t think that was a long time ago, take a look at how young some of these gents look. In a game with fewer players. So an enormous ratio! It’s a sensational day in Perth. Prime conditions for a long walk and a great game of footy. The annual Dreamtime fixture really is a beaut. It’s something lovers of this great game should cherish.

Anyway, I apologise for the early digression. </p> <p>Here, yesterday, was a day to long remember as Sussex’s debutant Dan Ibrahim became the youngest player to score a fifty in Championship history, aged 16 and 299 days. He looked the real deal in front of a near-2,000 crowd. His composure really stood out before he struck with his medium pacers as Yorkshire slipped to 95-2 in reply to 313.</p> <p>Unfortunately, things got much harder for the young buck and his mates as Dawid Malan and Gary Ballance shared an unbroken 177 and will resume this morning looking to put a young attack on the ropes from 272-2. Malan (103) brought up a serene century in the final over the day and Ballance has 74. </p> <p>If Yorkshire can complete victory, it is likely to put them back within a handful of points of Group Three leaders Lancashire, who are on course for defeat in a quite remarkable game at Glamorgan.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2021/jun/04/somerset-v-hampshire-glamorgan-v-yorkshire-and-more-county-cricket-live\">Glamorgan close on win over Lancs: county cricket – as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On what Alex Davies has described as a “substandard” pitch, Glamorgan are 137-3 needing 50 more to win with Marnus Labuschagne unbeaten on 32. The only remaining unbeaten record in county cricket this summer looks set to disappear. Mind you, get Marnus out immediately this morning and it could be different.</p> <p>Given the weather up North, I was absolutely staggered to see no play in the Test at Lord’s and also at Canterbury and Chelmsford in the Championship yesterday. When play does resume, Northamptonshire will be 362-5 against Kent in the other Group Three fixture and Notts will be 248-6 against Essex in the Group One top-of-the-table clash.</p> <p>Worcestershire have it all to do in Group One at New Road against an emerging Durham; 151 behind with seven wickets remaining and Jake Libby 51 not out.</p> <p>Likewise for Derbyshire at the County Ground against Warwickshire. The Bears, at 132-7 in their second innings, lead by 285. Derby will have to post the highest score of the match to claim victory. </p> <p>In Group Two at Taunton, it’s relatively even between Somerset (360) and Hampshire (285-7). I’d just rather be Somerset, but Hampshire have Lewis McManus unbeaten on 91 chasing his second career hundred. </p> <p>Gloucestershire’s popular and profitable start to the season is in danger of coming to a juddering halt. Beaten by Surrey last week, they are on course for a second away defeat at Leicestershire. They are 5-1 second time around, trailing by 281 with Leicestershire still to bat again. </p> <p>Elsewhere, there are a trio of Rachael Heyhoe Flint Trophy games taking place. I will have a keen eye on the Northern Diamonds game against Sunrisers at Fenner’s. I covered the Diamonds’ win against Lightning at Kibworth on Monday, a low-scoring thriller. I didn’t have much faith in the sunny forecast, didn’t bother with suncream and came away looking like Jerry the Berry from Phoenix Nights. Eek! </p> <p>All the England players, Katherine Brunt, Nat Sciver, etc are available once more before reporting for Test duty before facing India at Bristol on 16 June. South East Stars also face Western Storm at the Oval, and it is Southern Vipers versus Central Sparks at Hove in a clash between the only two unbeaten teams so far.</p> </div>   </div>","wordcount":"769","commentCloseDate":"2021-06-08T08:15:00Z","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2021-06-05T08:17:25Z","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2021-06-05T10:18:14Z","liveBloggingNow":"true","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/p/hkybb","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c1f3b509b2af8e7836b07620995dc5b693de349/0_143_3274_1966/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","isLive":"true","bodyText":"Early wicket at Cardiff.

Here, yesterday, was a day to long remember as Sussex’s debutant Dan Ibrahim became the youngest player to score a fifty in Championship history, aged 16 and 299 days. He looked the real deal in front of a near-2,000 crowd. His composure really stood out before he struck with his medium pacers as Yorkshire slipped to 95-2 in reply to 313. Unfortunately, things got much harder for the young buck and his mates as Dawid Malan and Gary Ballance shared an unbroken 177 and will resume this morning looking to put a young attack on the ropes from 272-2. Malan (103) brought up a serene century in the final over the day and Ballance has 74. If Yorkshire can complete victory, it is likely to put them back within a handful of points of Group Three leaders Lancashire, who are on course for defeat in a quite remarkable game at Glamorgan. On what Alex Davies has described as a “substandard” pitch, Glamorgan are 137-3 needing 50 more to win with Marnus Labuschagne unbeaten on 32. The only remaining unbeaten record in county cricket this summer looks set to disappear. Mind you, get Marnus out immediately this morning and it could be different. Given the weather up North, I was absolutely staggered to see no play in the Test at Lord’s and also at Canterbury and Chelmsford in the Championship yesterday. When play does resume, Northamptonshire will be 362-5 against Kent in the other Group Three fixture and Notts will be 248-6 against Essex in the Group One top-of-the-table clash. Worcestershire have it all to do in Group One at New Road against an emerging Durham; 151 behind with seven wickets remaining and Jake Libby 51 not out. Likewise for Derbyshire at the County Ground against Warwickshire. The Bears, at 132-7 in their second innings, lead by 285. Derby will have to post the highest score of the match to claim victory. In Group Two at Taunton, it’s relatively even between Somerset (360) and Hampshire (285-7). I’d just rather be Somerset, but Hampshire have Lewis McManus unbeaten on 91 chasing his second career hundred. Gloucestershire’s popular and profitable start to the season is in danger of coming to a juddering halt. Beaten by Surrey last week, they are on course for a second away defeat at Leicestershire. They are 5-1 second time around, trailing by 281 with Leicestershire still to bat again. Elsewhere, there are a trio of Rachael Heyhoe Flint Trophy games taking place. I will have a keen eye on the Northern Diamonds game against Sunrisers at Fenner’s. I covered the Diamonds’ win against Lightning at Kibworth on Monday, a low-scoring thriller. I didn’t have much faith in the sunny forecast, didn’t bother with suncream and came away looking like Jerry the Berry from Phoenix Nights. Eek! All the England players, Katherine Brunt, Nat Sciver, etc are available once more before reporting for Test duty before facing India at Bristol on 16 June. South East Stars also face Western Storm at the Oval, and it is Southern Vipers versus Central Sparks at Hove in a clash between the only two unbeaten teams so far.","charCount":"4514","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/graham-hardcastle\">Graham Hardcastle</a> at Headingley"},{"headline":"Victoria records five new Covid cases as official says Delta variant likely leaked from hotel quarantine","standfirst":"<p>New variant probably came through an importation from overseas via hotel quarantine, infectious diseases expert says</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/jun/05/from-blame-game-to-dogs-breakfast-how-australias-aged-care-homes-were-left-open-to-covid-again\">How Australia’s aged care homes were left open to Covid again</a><br></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/05/using-afterpay-to-buy-food-guardian-readers-who-lost-work-tell-how-they-are-surviving-melbournes-lockdown\">Guardian readers who lost work tell how they are surviving Melbourne’s lockdown</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/jun/04/covid-19-list-melbourne-public-exposure-sites-hotspots-victoria-venues-case-location-alerts-metro-regional-vic-coronavirus-cases-outbreak-locations\">Victoria Covid-19 exposure sites</a>; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/jun/04/covid-19-list-nsw-public-exposure-sites-hotspots-goulburn-jervis-bay-hyams-beach-gundagai-venues-case-location-alerts-sydney-regional-coronavirus-cases-outbreak-locations\">NSW exposure sites</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/jun/04/melbourne-lockdown-covid-victoria-restrictions-coronavirus-rules-covid19-explained-10km-radius-masks-compulsory-exercising-home-gatherings-what-you-need-to-know\">Victoria’s lockdown restrictions explained</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2021/jun/04/covid-19-vaccine-rollout-australia-coronavirus-vaccination-progress-updates-tracker-victoria-nsw-queensland-qld-daily-live-data-stats-updates-total-numbers-distribution-schedule-tracking-new-cases-today\">Australia’s vaccine rollout numbers: progress state-by-state</a></li></ul>","trailText":"New variant probably came through an importation from overseas via hotel quarantine, infectious diseases expert says","byline":"Michael McGowan","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"54808c5102e22e7a9eb7ced71855a18e3214bdc7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/54808c5102e22e7a9eb7ced71855a18e3214bdc7/0_175_4331_2600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People line up outside the Covid-19 vaccination hub at the Royal Exhibition Building in Melbourne\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Victoria reported five new cases of Covid from 36,362 tests on day nine of Melbourne’s fourth lockdown, including two cases linked to the Delta variant.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Darrian Traynor/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>A senior public health official says her “strong hypothesis” is that the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus that caused a second outbreak in Melbourne was caused by a hotel quarantine leak.</p> <p>Victoria reported five new cases of Covid-19 on Saturday from 36,362 tests on day nine of Melbourne’s fourth lockdown, including two cases linked to the so-called Delta variant – which emerged in India during its devastating outbreak.</p> <p>On Saturday the infectious diseases expert Prof Sharon Lewin from the Doherty Institute was asked whether she believed the West Melbourne family that caught the strain could have caught it while holidaying in Jervis Bay in New South Wales.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/jun/05/another-level-of-confusion-private-contractors-at-odds-over-whether-they-were-meant-to-vaccinate-aged-care-staff\">‘Another level of confusion’: private contractors at odds over whether they were meant to vaccinate aged care staff</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lewin did not rule it out as a possibility – saying there was “extensive testing” occurring in the south coast holiday town – but said it was more likely the strain emerged from someone in hotel quarantine.</p> <p>“My strong hypothesis is that it’s coming through an importation from overseas, through our quarantine hotels.

Victoria reported five new cases of Covid-19 on Saturday from 36,362 tests on day nine of Melbourne’s fourth lockdown, including two cases linked to the so-called Delta variant – which emerged in India during its devastating outbreak. On Saturday the infectious diseases expert Prof Sharon Lewin from the Doherty Institute was asked whether she believed the West Melbourne family that caught the strain could have caught it while holidaying in Jervis Bay in New South Wales. Lewin did not rule it out as a possibility – saying there was “extensive testing” occurring in the south coast holiday town – but said it was more likely the strain emerged from someone in hotel quarantine. “My strong hypothesis is that it’s coming through an importation from overseas, through our quarantine hotels. That would be the most likely,” she said. Lewin is leading sequencing efforts in Victoria in an attempt to track down the origin of the new strain, but cautioned that it was possible the source would never be known definitively. “Every effort is being made right now to look for that match, but we may not get the match,” she said. Unlike the original case in Melbourne’s latest outbreak where there was a “clear match” with South Australian hotel quarantine, Lewin said it was not yet possible to say whether the leak might have occurred in Victoria or another state. Lewin said limitations to sequencing meant that for about 20% of the population who test positive genomic sequencing was not possible, either because their viral load was too low or because of the stage of the virus at the time of testing. “So there are 20% of people who are positive and we do not have a genetic barcode for,” she said. Two of the five new cases were linked to the Delta variant. The variant was initially detected in two members of the West Melbourne family who travelled to NSW, and on Saturday the Victorian health minister Martin Foley said one of the new cases was the second child in that family. The second new Delta variant case was a previously identified primary close contact “who works with a family member who tested positive in the first West Melbourne group”. Of the three other cases reported on Saturday one was a contact of another known case while the remaining two were unlinked. Foley said that while those two cases did not have a close contact with an existing case, they were frequent visitors of a shopping centre in Craigieburn, which is now associated with seven cases. Victoria’a Covid-19 logistics chief Jeroen Weimar said one of the new cases recorded on Saturday was a worker at a large construction site. Run by major builder ProBuild, the site had now been closed and 170 close contacts had been identified. The new cases, recorded from 36,362 tests on day nine of Melbourne’s fourth lockdown, come as health officials said on Friday that they had no intention of ending the extended lockdown early, despite two cases of what was described as “fleeting transmission” being reclassified as false positives this week. Three of Victoria’s four new cases on Friday were members of a family previously reported to have travelled to NSW. The strain of virus – the infectious Delta variant, which has become the predominant form of the virus in Covid-ravaged India – had been detected in the family of four, who returned to Victoria from the NSW south coast tourist town of Jervis Bay last week. On Friday the Victorian chief health officer, Brett Sutton, said genomic sequencing had revealed the cases linked to that outbreak were of a separate strain to the rest of the outbreak in the state, which was linked to the Kappa variant. In a press conference he raised the possibility that the family had caught the virus in NSW, something he called “a very significant concern”. “It has not been linked to any sequence cases across Australia from hotel quarantine or anywhere else,” he said. But the NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, shot down that claim, saying in an interview on the Sydney radio station 2GB that there was “no evidence whatsoever” the family had caught the virus in the state. “No one knows where they got this, particular, precise [variant] from,” he said.

A journalist at the Oxford Mail, she was seen leaving her shared house in Cowley, about an hour’s walk from the centre of Oxford. Then she was gone.</p> <p>When she didn’t turn up to meet a friend in London the next day, alarm bells started ringing. Within hours there were hundreds of tweets about her, describing her, detailing her last known movements, and asking for information.</p> <p>But Esther hadn’t planned to become a missing person. She just wanted a break, and had taken herself somewhere else to get some space. “In my eyes, people were missing from me,” she told me last summer. “I’d removed myself from everything, to try to push the world away.”</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.missingpeople.org.uk/for-professionals/information-and-policy/information-and-research/key-information\" title=\"\">About 180,000 people are reported missing</a> in the UK every year, a number that is believed to be a significant underestimate. Among them are the individual stories that capture our collective, horrified attention: the people taken and harmed, or whose vanishing seems immediately to speak to something wider than the facts of the case alone, like the disappearance and death of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/mar/15/ive-been-quiet-too-long-reflections-on-the-death-of-sarah-everard\" title=\"\">Sarah Everard</a> in March.</p> <p>But there are innumerable reasons why a person might go missing. It is often, consciously or not, an attempt to exercise control in a life where things have started to slip. This control, however, is often illusory; when an online appeal springs up, a missing person’s image is circulated far and wide across social media, with any context and complexity to their story often stripped away.</p> <p>I became fascinated by these stories as a way of understanding a disappearance in my own life. In my early childhood in the late 1990s, my father, Christobal, returned to his Spanish homeland from London, not long before my mother’s death. He was a young man, beset by a patchwork of vulnerabilities. After a brief visit to his home city a few months later, we lost touch – a silence that gradually became an estrangement. In the decades since, he became a missing person to me, if not to the world he knew back home. It set me on a path to discover: can you ever close one chapter of your life? If someone is missing you, do you have the right to be gone?</p> <p>***</p> <p>I meet Esther on an overcast afternoon in Newcastle city centre. We compare our recent attempts to quit smoking as I rustle for a filter tip and Esther pops a piece of nicotine gum. Her life now, she says, is very different from those frenzied days. She is healthy, happy and teaching journalism master’s students at Newcastle University.</p> <p>On the day she disappeared, Esther had taken £150 out of a cashpoint and made her way to London, which she knew well from her student days, and where she had already made a reservation at a hotel. </p> <p>By the Saturday afternoon, a friend she was due to meet sensed something was wrong and tweeted that Esther, then 27, hadn’t shown up to meet her and a former housemate. It was, the tweet ran, “very out of character”.</p> <p>The next day, holed up in a nondescript Travelodge, Esther started to realise what was happening online. Her name was everywhere she looked, amplified across Facebook and Twitter. People speculated about where she was and why she had left. Her face, her personal details plastered everywhere. “Have you seen this woman? Red hair, glasses and a strong geordie accent”: an entire life stripped down to bullet points. One tweet even speculated about which tabloid would be the one to “pay the most” for the story of her disappearance.</p> <p>“I’d planned to hole up in the hotel, which made total sense at the time. Then I could see [the social media] stuff blowing up. My face and people’s thoughts about me were being shared across the UK and beyond.” Esther says. She had just wanted to be alone, but this wasn’t what solitude was supposed to feel like. Her phone was deluged with increasingly panicked messages and phone calls, from family and relative strangers, including her year 9 geography teacher. Esther couldn’t bring herself to answer them. Then there were the actual strangers; people inserting themselves into her private messages, asking where she’d gone and when she was coming back. On the late afternoon of Sunday 31 January, Esther walked into St Thomas’ hospital, a few yards from the crowds of tourists on Westminster Bridge, and asked to see the mental health crisis team. Her missing episode, as the rest of the world seemed to be calling it, was over. She had been found safe and well, to use the standard policing jargon.</p> <p>When someone goes missing, it is usually because a serious vulnerability has opened up in their lives. Though it is never reducible to a single cause, eight in 10 missing adults have a mental health condition. After Esther’s return, she was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD), a condition that carries with it stigma and misunderstanding .</p> <p>On the day of her disappearance, there were signs of what Esther now considers to be hypomania, a common hallmark of BPD. “I knew that I didn’t want anybody to know where I was going. I just knew I wanted to be away. Away from existence, I suppose. I booked the hotel on Expedia while I sat in my living room, chatting to my housemate telling me everything was fine, that I was going to be fine.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>We’ve had messages from people asking us to take posts down: they don’t want to be found by the person looking for them</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Eighty-five<a href=\"https://www.missingpeople.org.uk/for-professionals/information-and-policy/information-and-research/key-information#section-4\" title=\"\"> per cent of missing adults return</a>, as Esther did, within two days (that figure stands at 90% for children). In contrast to the volume of speculation expended on the missing, the act of returning is rarely discussed. Esther now advocates for mandatory “return interviews” for the people who do come home, to help understand the pressures that led to the disappearance and treat them before they build up to another flight.</p> <p>Emphasis, Esther says, is usually placed on everyone but the missing person, “who is in this vacuum of support and, potentially, reality. I’ve never spoken about my missing episode in any kind of therapeutic environment.”</p> <p>Almost everyone I’ve spoken to in the professional world of the missing – from academics and police to frontline mental health workers and the charity <a href=\"https://www.missingpeople.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Missing People</a> – has said something similar: that the person at the heart of the “missing episode” is often forgotten once they are found. There is often little support to help them access the services they need, or to soften the impact of their return – particularly, in helping them deal with worried loved ones who searched for them; worry that can sometimes slip into anger or resentment. And there is no programme to help vulnerable people deal with the shock of their image amplified, seemingly endlessly, across social media without their consent.</p> <p>During the summer of 2019, I spoke to Joe Apps, the head of the National Crime Agency’s Missing Persons Unit, about whether the internet has made it harder for people to go missing. He felt the opposite may be true. Yes, you may have social media networks, he told me, but how robust are the relationships they engender? And if things start to unravel to the point of disappearance, how long would it take for these online connections to notice?</p> <p>The impulse to want to find a missing person is understandable. It feels like the best (maybe the only) thing you can do in the face of that specific form of helplessness and grief. One can feel like an actor in a noble cause, to help locate someone who has slipped out of sight. The lost teenager or wandering dementia patient, whose face is staring back at you on Facebook or Twitter from a grainy picture, screenshotted from their social media profiles along with the police or family appeal itself.</p> <p>I’ve spent more time than is healthy scrolling down the many amateur sleuth-run Facebook pages devoted to the hunt for the missing, of the kind where Esther’s appeal was circulated. Some focus on an individual case (often at the initiative of family and friends), while others are general sounding boards where dozens of appeals are posted a day, to varying degrees of interest or success.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The instinct, as a family member, is to shout out as loud as you can. You want to do everything, and press every button</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Paula Adby, 45, is the founder of <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/809593019079555\" title=\"\">Help Find Missing People in the UK</a>, one of the largest such groups with almost 3,000 members. Her interest in the missing stems from a case she’d seen circulating a number of years ago, near her Surrey home. Apart from the occasional story on the news, she had no idea how many people seemed to be vanishing every day, across the country. “It shocked the hell out of me. When someone goes missing you want to find them. The last two or three years, the group’s grown like crazy.” she says.</p> <p>There have been a number of cases where the group’s strategy of trawling the internet has resulted in successful reconnections: mostly people who have lost contact with a loved one and had no idea where else to turn. But Adby says she hadn’t thought about the potential long-term impact of social media appeals on those that later returned. What motivated her, she says, was the feeling of “lying awake at night thinking, ‘Where are you?

A journalist at the Oxford Mail, she was seen leaving her shared house in Cowley, about an hour’s walk from the centre of Oxford. Then she was gone. When she didn’t turn up to meet a friend in London the next day, alarm bells started ringing. Within hours there were hundreds of tweets about her, describing her, detailing her last known movements, and asking for information. But Esther hadn’t planned to become a missing person. She just wanted a break, and had taken herself somewhere else to get some space. “In my eyes, people were missing from me,” she told me last summer. “I’d removed myself from everything, to try to push the world away.” About 180,000 people are reported missing in the UK every year, a number that is believed to be a significant underestimate. Among them are the individual stories that capture our collective, horrified attention: the people taken and harmed, or whose vanishing seems immediately to speak to something wider than the facts of the case alone, like the disappearance and death of Sarah Everard in March. But there are innumerable reasons why a person might go missing. It is often, consciously or not, an attempt to exercise control in a life where things have started to slip. This control, however, is often illusory; when an online appeal springs up, a missing person’s image is circulated far and wide across social media, with any context and complexity to their story often stripped away. I became fascinated by these stories as a way of understanding a disappearance in my own life. In my early childhood in the late 1990s, my father, Christobal, returned to his Spanish homeland from London, not long before my mother’s death. He was a young man, beset by a patchwork of vulnerabilities. After a brief visit to his home city a few months later, we lost touch – a silence that gradually became an estrangement. In the decades since, he became a missing person to me, if not to the world he knew back home. It set me on a path to discover: can you ever close one chapter of your life? If someone is missing you, do you have the right to be gone? *** I meet Esther on an overcast afternoon in Newcastle city centre. We compare our recent attempts to quit smoking as I rustle for a filter tip and Esther pops a piece of nicotine gum. Her life now, she says, is very different from those frenzied days. She is healthy, happy and teaching journalism master’s students at Newcastle University. On the day she disappeared, Esther had taken £150 out of a cashpoint and made her way to London, which she knew well from her student days, and where she had already made a reservation at a hotel. By the Saturday afternoon, a friend she was due to meet sensed something was wrong and tweeted that Esther, then 27, hadn’t shown up to meet her and a former housemate. It was, the tweet ran, “very out of character”. The next day, holed up in a nondescript Travelodge, Esther started to realise what was happening online. Her name was everywhere she looked, amplified across Facebook and Twitter. People speculated about where she was and why she had left. Her face, her personal details plastered everywhere. “Have you seen this woman? Red hair, glasses and a strong geordie accent”: an entire life stripped down to bullet points. One tweet even speculated about which tabloid would be the one to “pay the most” for the story of her disappearance. “I’d planned to hole up in the hotel, which made total sense at the time. Then I could see [the social media] stuff blowing up. My face and people’s thoughts about me were being shared across the UK and beyond.” Esther says. She had just wanted to be alone, but this wasn’t what solitude was supposed to feel like. Her phone was deluged with increasingly panicked messages and phone calls, from family and relative strangers, including her year 9 geography teacher. Esther couldn’t bring herself to answer them. Then there were the actual strangers; people inserting themselves into her private messages, asking where she’d gone and when she was coming back. On the late afternoon of Sunday 31 January, Esther walked into St Thomas’ hospital, a few yards from the crowds of tourists on Westminster Bridge, and asked to see the mental health crisis team. Her missing episode, as the rest of the world seemed to be calling it, was over. She had been found safe and well, to use the standard policing jargon. When someone goes missing, it is usually because a serious vulnerability has opened up in their lives. Though it is never reducible to a single cause, eight in 10 missing adults have a mental health condition. After Esther’s return, she was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD), a condition that carries with it stigma and misunderstanding . On the day of her disappearance, there were signs of what Esther now considers to be hypomania, a common hallmark of BPD. “I knew that I didn’t want anybody to know where I was going. I just knew I wanted to be away. Away from existence, I suppose. I booked the hotel on Expedia while I sat in my living room, chatting to my housemate telling me everything was fine, that I was going to be fine.” Eighty-five per cent of missing adults return, as Esther did, within two days (that figure stands at 90% for children). In contrast to the volume of speculation expended on the missing, the act of returning is rarely discussed. Esther now advocates for mandatory “return interviews” for the people who do come home, to help understand the pressures that led to the disappearance and treat them before they build up to another flight. Emphasis, Esther says, is usually placed on everyone but the missing person, “who is in this vacuum of support and, potentially, reality. I’ve never spoken about my missing episode in any kind of therapeutic environment.” Almost everyone I’ve spoken to in the professional world of the missing – from academics and police to frontline mental health workers and the charity Missing People – has said something similar: that the person at the heart of the “missing episode” is often forgotten once they are found. There is often little support to help them access the services they need, or to soften the impact of their return – particularly, in helping them deal with worried loved ones who searched for them; worry that can sometimes slip into anger or resentment. And there is no programme to help vulnerable people deal with the shock of their image amplified, seemingly endlessly, across social media without their consent. During the summer of 2019, I spoke to Joe Apps, the head of the National Crime Agency’s Missing Persons Unit, about whether the internet has made it harder for people to go missing. He felt the opposite may be true. Yes, you may have social media networks, he told me, but how robust are the relationships they engender? And if things start to unravel to the point of disappearance, how long would it take for these online connections to notice? The impulse to want to find a missing person is understandable. It feels like the best (maybe the only) thing you can do in the face of that specific form of helplessness and grief. One can feel like an actor in a noble cause, to help locate someone who has slipped out of sight. The lost teenager or wandering dementia patient, whose face is staring back at you on Facebook or Twitter from a grainy picture, screenshotted from their social media profiles along with the police or family appeal itself. I’ve spent more time than is healthy scrolling down the many amateur sleuth-run Facebook pages devoted to the hunt for the missing, of the kind where Esther’s appeal was circulated. Some focus on an individual case (often at the initiative of family and friends), while others are general sounding boards where dozens of appeals are posted a day, to varying degrees of interest or success. Paula Adby, 45, is the founder of Help Find Missing People in the UK, one of the largest such groups with almost 3,000 members. Her interest in the missing stems from a case she’d seen circulating a number of years ago, near her Surrey home. Apart from the occasional story on the news, she had no idea how many people seemed to be vanishing every day, across the country. “It shocked the hell out of me. When someone goes missing you want to find them. The last two or three years, the group’s grown like crazy.” she says. There have been a number of cases where the group’s strategy of trawling the internet has resulted in successful reconnections: mostly people who have lost contact with a loved one and had no idea where else to turn. But Adby says she hadn’t thought about the potential long-term impact of social media appeals on those that later returned. What motivated her, she says, was the feeling of “lying awake at night thinking, ‘Where are you? Please just go home,’ especially if they’re really young or have mental health problems.” Though Adby and her fellow admins have a sincere desire to find the missing (voluntarily giving up much free time in the process), not everyone who wants to use the group is so scrupulous. They have to be wary. Recently, they received a panicked message from a woman who had run away from an abusive marriage with her child. “He was posting on our site trying to find her. We’ve had other people message us saying, ‘Please take that post down, we don’t want to be found by that person.’” Fleeing violence is not an exercise in the right to be forgotten, but an essential need, an instance when coming back holds more danger than going missing. *** Physical appeals fade over time. The poster at the bus stop will be torn down or taped over in the days, weeks and months after a disappearance. But a viral tweet doesn’t decompose. You are what Google says you are, runs a digital age truism. If the search engine or the long-dormant social media appeal says you’re a missing person, then that’s what you remain, returned or not. The effects on everything from employment prospects to fundamental questions of self-perception are likely to vary depending on a person’s individual vulnerability. In one 2017 report, on the impact of publicity appeals in missing children cases, the mother of a teenager who had gone missing and attempted suicide at 16 expressed concern, two and a half years later, about her daughter still coming across news articles about it. Dr Karen Shalev Greene is director of the Centre for the Study of Missing Persons at the University of Portsmouth, as well as one of the report’s co-authors. She tells me that social media appeals are a double-edged sword. “The instinct, as a family member, is to shout out as loud as you can. You want to do everything, and press every button.” It’s not that it’s the wrong thing to do, she adds. How, say, to second-guess the anguish of a parent living in the shadow of a missing child? “You’d take that one in a million chance. Families will take it because they’re desperate, and there is a chance that it will help.” It’s almost impossible to accurately document the effectiveness of social media campaigns, though, as Greene explains, that isn’t their entire purpose. Several returned children, interviewed by Missing People, said that social media appeals convinced them that coming back would be safe; that there was someone who cared. Their amplification can make you feel less alone, on both sides of the missing divide: the searchers as well as the searched-for. *** A few weeks after her return, Esther moved back to the north-east, determined to find some mental health support. “I’d gone from very intensive support to nothing.

But these cursory searches reveal nothing, other than how much more effort it would take me to use these means to track him down. Talking to Esther underlined to me that not everyone wants to be found. Or perhaps, after so many years, Christobal considers me just as missing from his life as I do him from mine. • If You Were There by Francisco Garcia is published by HarperCollins at £14.99.

Then another lottery was set up in West Virginia. In Illinois people could get free tickets to the Six Flags amusement park. In New Jersey it meant a free beer. The governor of Minnesota announced giveaways that included fishing licenses, gift cards and state park permits, among others. And West Virginia upped the ante, adding the chance to win hunting rifles or shotguns. Governors across the country are resorting to almost shameless incentives to lure Americans who haven’t gotten a coronavirus vaccine to willingly take a jab.

In New Jersey, the governor, in partnership with the state’s department of health, set up a “shot and a beer” incentive program, which lets any New Jerseyan of legal drinking age who gets their first vaccine shot in May to also enjoy a free beer through breweries participating in the program. That sort of approach got a shoutout from Joe Biden on Wednesday when he announced a month of action to reach the goal of vaccinating 70% of US adults by the Fourth of July holiday, with the president nodding to a beer-maker’s proposed giveaway by saying: “That’s right, get a shot and have a beer.

What does this mean? Part of the answer comes when I step from our hut to use the composting toilet at night and jump at the sound of a colossal groan from the blackness. A hulking presence with two curved horns looms against the sky – a water buffalo.</p> <p>The following morning, as the mist slips from the distant moors, we have breakfast at the picnic table outside and more beasts appear, separated from the huts by an unobtrusive barbed-wire fence. The buffaloes’ curved noses give them a quizzical, intelligent look; there’s also a cluster of skittish dark Exmoor ponies. The most approachable animals are the “iron-age pigs”, a wild boar/Tamworth cross whose spectacular rootles make the pasture look like it has been ineptly ploughed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"386b6da2a84dad9d57fd4a9b068f0f11eb75d35d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/386b6da2a84dad9d57fd4a9b068f0f11eb75d35d/389_26_1091_654/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shepherd’s huts with views of the Tamar and Bodmin Moor\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shepherd’s huts with views of the Tamar and Bodmin Moor</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gow’s farm seems a quirky menagerie, but each animal has a purpose and the operation is driven by his genuine passion for restoring Britain’s denuded natural landscape. These herbivores roam freely in the former sheep farm and its woodland because Gow is seeking to replicate the actions of extinct grazers – wild horses, cattle and boar, whose browsing and rooting (and dung) was historically a great driver of biodiversity. </p> <p>The beneficial effects of (not too many) free-living herbivores has been shown at <a href=\"https://knepp.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Knepp</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/15/the-magical-wilderness-farm-raising-cows-among-the-weeds-at-knepp\" title=\"\">rewilded farm in West Sussex</a> that has inspired British rewilding.

Guests can stay in five new huts, all spaced for privacy across two fields, plus a spruced-up old Gypsy caravan. Each hut sleeps two, and a hot shower and composting toilet are shared by three huts. There’s also a camping field with four pitches. In an open-sided barn is a communal area with pizza ovens, a charging point for phones and cameras, wood-fired barbecues, sofas and board games. The tranquillity is ensured by a no-under-10s and no-dogs policy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d0ea08aff31fa11d1980e1a385581e0d25f6caaf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d0ea08aff31fa11d1980e1a385581e0d25f6caaf/0_0_5715_3429/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rewilding at Derek Gow’s farm in Devon\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of the 12 wildcats that will lead a captive-breeding effort to reintroduce these predators into England and Wales 200 years after they were driven to extinction.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We find the sensitivities of the animals around us encourage stillness.

We begin by bumping through the fields in Gow’s old Land Rover to admire what he says proudly are Britain’s only herd of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/05/devon-farmer-forced-offload-nazi-bred-super-cows\" title=\"\">Heck cattle</a>. “Nobody else wants them. They’ve got a terrible reputation,” he beams. Truly wild cattle were hunted to extinction in Europe in medieval times, but these aggressive versions, bred in Germany in the 1920s, are here to perform the same role – roughing up woodland and grassland, creating opportunities for other species to move in.</p> <p>We’re then taken to Gow’s captive-breeding centre, which is like peeking behind the curtain of a small zoo, except each animal’s offspring will be restored to the wild. Photography tours are available for day trippers as well as campers, and Gow also offers bespoke tours for visitors particularly interested in reintroducing species, such as harvest mice or beavers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3ab997a3cd6b455521bccc61d0788a155836f774\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ab997a3cd6b455521bccc61d0788a155836f774/0_38_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Farm workers cleaning out the water vole cages.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Farm workers cleaning out the water vole cages.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The yard rings with a hollow clattering – white storks gently clashing beaks in bonding behaviour. We enjoy closeups of harvest mice, beavers, cranes and, perhaps most impressive, Gow’s “vole room”. There were once millions of Kenneth Grahame’s “Ratty” in Britain; today, the wild population is 77,000 and falling fast. This summer alone, Gow will release 1,700 water voles to aid conservation efforts. One species that won’t be liberated are three stunning lynx, which he rescued from a private collection. Accustomed to controversy over reintroductions, he acknowledges it may be some years before lynx are successfully returned to Britain.</p> <p>Water voles and everything from fish to dragonflies thrive in beaver-created wetlands, and this explains Gow’s obsession with this chunky, herbivorous rodent.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e32c342b423284e0327dfbb11017113c44e9c702\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e32c342b423284e0327dfbb11017113c44e9c702/0_2_1000_600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beaver in the water\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beavers live freely on Coombeshead Farm</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Close encounters are wonderful, but it’s a deeper pleasure to discover beavers in the wild. On our final evening, Gow leads us into the heart of his valley, where beavers live freely. We admire the scale of their stick-and-mud dams which, incredibly, rise two metres in places. We wait quietly beside a pond. While beavers slumber in capacious stick “lodges”, we enjoy a kind of dusk bathing, watching long-tailed tits flit through the woods as a willow warbler makes its somnolent descending call.</p> <p>No beavers show themselves but watching for them is a magical experience on a unique farm that will only get wilder and more bewitching as the years roll by.</p> <p>• <em>Shepherd’s huts at <a href=\"https://rewildingcoombeshead.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Coombeshead Rewilding</a></em><em> from £100 a night</em><em> (two-night minimum) including wildlife tour.

There is a pair of pretty shepherd’s huts with adjoining kitchens in a meadow where dandelions and cuckoo flowers bloom. And there is a glorious view over pasture and woodland towards the blue hills of Bodmin Moor. But this is the British countryside accompanied by a large dollop of strangeness, particularly at dusk. “Quick!” calls an unearthly being from the alders behind our hut. “Crhrup!” replies another. I follow the sound through the trees to an aviary. Inside is a black stork the size of a child and a posse of night herons, exotic cream-and-inky-midnight-blue nocturnal birds. Their “Quick! Crhrup!” calls echo through the silent valley. Neither species is a wild resident of Britain, although that may change if Derek Gow gets his way. We’re staying at Coombeshead in north-west Devon, a 61-hectare (150-acre) farm being rewilded by Gow. Every landowner seems to be dabbling with eagles and beavers these days, but Gow is the rewilders’ rewilder. A blunt, visionary Scot known as Mr Beaver (his book Bringing Back the Beaver was published last year), Gow supplies water voles, beavers and storks to restoration projects around the country. Now, after years of enabling others’ rewilding, Gow is restoring “natural processes” to his once-conventional sheep farm. What does this mean? Part of the answer comes when I step from our hut to use the composting toilet at night and jump at the sound of a colossal groan from the blackness. A hulking presence with two curved horns looms against the sky – a water buffalo. The following morning, as the mist slips from the distant moors, we have breakfast at the picnic table outside and more beasts appear, separated from the huts by an unobtrusive barbed-wire fence. The buffaloes’ curved noses give them a quizzical, intelligent look; there’s also a cluster of skittish dark Exmoor ponies. The most approachable animals are the “iron-age pigs”, a wild boar/Tamworth cross whose spectacular rootles make the pasture look like it has been ineptly ploughed. Gow’s farm seems a quirky menagerie, but each animal has a purpose and the operation is driven by his genuine passion for restoring Britain’s denuded natural landscape. These herbivores roam freely in the former sheep farm and its woodland because Gow is seeking to replicate the actions of extinct grazers – wild horses, cattle and boar, whose browsing and rooting (and dung) was historically a great driver of biodiversity. The beneficial effects of (not too many) free-living herbivores has been shown at Knepp, the rewilded farm in West Sussex that has inspired British rewilding. The pigs break up the grassy sward so wildflowers can take root; buffalo wallows hold water and are home to insects and amphibians; and the absence of chemicals means dung beetles and other invertebrates flourish. Gow hopes tourism will fund his restoration. Guests can stay in five new huts, all spaced for privacy across two fields, plus a spruced-up old Gypsy caravan. Each hut sleeps two, and a hot shower and composting toilet are shared by three huts. There’s also a camping field with four pitches. In an open-sided barn is a communal area with pizza ovens, a charging point for phones and cameras, wood-fired barbecues, sofas and board games. The tranquillity is ensured by a no-under-10s and no-dogs policy. We find the sensitivities of the animals around us encourage stillness. Each evening, we walk quietly to a raised platform overlooking six large enclosures filled with trunks and stumps of old trees. Inside, two eyes glare back at us from tall grass: a wildcat, one of six pairs that will lead a captive-breeding effort to reintroduce these tabby and tawny-patterned predators into England and Wales 200 years after they were driven to extinction. From the platform, we have views of Gow’s “sky table”, on which he places roadkill deer carcasses in the hope of luring passing white-tailed eagles. (One visited earlier this spring, but not during our stay.) On our second day, we take a two-and-a-half hour “animal encounter” tour, which is free for glampers and can also be booked by day visitors. We begin by bumping through the fields in Gow’s old Land Rover to admire what he says proudly are Britain’s only herd of Heck cattle. “Nobody else wants them. They’ve got a terrible reputation,” he beams. Truly wild cattle were hunted to extinction in Europe in medieval times, but these aggressive versions, bred in Germany in the 1920s, are here to perform the same role – roughing up woodland and grassland, creating opportunities for other species to move in. We’re then taken to Gow’s captive-breeding centre, which is like peeking behind the curtain of a small zoo, except each animal’s offspring will be restored to the wild. Photography tours are available for day trippers as well as campers, and Gow also offers bespoke tours for visitors particularly interested in reintroducing species, such as harvest mice or beavers. The yard rings with a hollow clattering – white storks gently clashing beaks in bonding behaviour. We enjoy closeups of harvest mice, beavers, cranes and, perhaps most impressive, Gow’s “vole room”. There were once millions of Kenneth Grahame’s “Ratty” in Britain; today, the wild population is 77,000 and falling fast. This summer alone, Gow will release 1,700 water voles to aid conservation efforts. One species that won’t be liberated are three stunning lynx, which he rescued from a private collection. Accustomed to controversy over reintroductions, he acknowledges it may be some years before lynx are successfully returned to Britain. Water voles and everything from fish to dragonflies thrive in beaver-created wetlands, and this explains Gow’s obsession with this chunky, herbivorous rodent. Close encounters are wonderful, but it’s a deeper pleasure to discover beavers in the wild. On our final evening, Gow leads us into the heart of his valley, where beavers live freely. We admire the scale of their stick-and-mud dams which, incredibly, rise two metres in places. We wait quietly beside a pond. While beavers slumber in capacious stick “lodges”, we enjoy a kind of dusk bathing, watching long-tailed tits flit through the woods as a willow warbler makes its somnolent descending call. No beavers show themselves but watching for them is a magical experience on a unique farm that will only get wilder and more bewitching as the years roll by. • Shepherd’s huts at Coombeshead Rewilding from £100 a night (two-night minimum) including wildlife tour. Beaver watching is £25pp; photography/wildlife walks/rewilding workshops available for day visitors as well as glampers; one-day wildlife photography course £140pp for groups of three, £55pp for groups of 8-12. Camping from £22pp a night Five more rewilding projects to visit Cambrian Wildwood, near Aberystwyth In the uplands of mid-Wales, close to the River Dyfi and the sea, the Cambrian Wildwood project aims to restore habitats and species (including pine marten, red squirrel and, eventually, wild boar and beaver) and give people the opportunity to experience nature. Focusing initially on 300 hectares (750 acres) of degraded valley and moorland, it plans to extend the wildwood to 3,000 hectares, through buying land and working with neighbouring landowners. It is first and foremost a community resource, and programmes bringing children and young adults to the wild are core to the project; but there are hiking trails and wild camping zones for all to enjoy. Trees for Life, Highlands The charity Trees for Life runs a 4,000-hectare rewilding estate at Dundreggan, west of Loch Ness. The mission is to restore the landscape to what it once might have been, which involves large-scale tree-planting after years of destruction, and the reintroduction of wildlife, including wild boar and pine marten. Visitors can join paid-for conservation weeks (be warned – they book up far in advance), and a visitor centre and accommodation are set to open here in 2022. Somerleyton, Suffolk More than 400 hectares of farmland on the Somerleyton estate, on the Norfolk-Suffolk border, is being largely left to rewild itself, with cattle, wild ponies and deer roaming free and playing a role in the natural regeneration of the land. There are plans to reintroduce bison, too. While the estate can be visited for the day, staying onsite at Fritton Lake in luxury cabins, cottages or rooms offers a more immersive experience. There’s a lake for boating and wild swimming, and activities include foraging and estate tours. Owner Hugh Somerleyton is one of the founders of Wild East, an initiative to encourage people in East Anglia to return 20% of their land to the wild (whether that’s a small garden or a huge farm).

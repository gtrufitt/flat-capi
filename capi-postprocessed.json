Frankly, We Did Win This Election: The Inside Story Of How Trump Lost, by Mike Bender, senior White House reporter for the Wall Street Journal, will be published in August. News of its contents, including “some amazingly hilarious revelations” about Mike Pence, Rudy Giuliani, Roger Stone, Tucker Carlson, Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump “and the rest of the Trump posse”, was reported by Punchbowl News. According to the news site, the ad known to Trump insiders as “the Hannity ad” and “the one Hannity wrote” ran only during Hannity’s show. An anonymous Trump aide is reported as saying “Hannity said this is our best spot yet” but Bender reports: “Inside the campaign, the spot was mocked mercilessly – mostly because of the dramatic, over-the-top language and a message that seemed to value quantity over quality. “Donald Trump himself, in a post-election interview with Bender, did not dispute that Hannity wrote the ad, which called [Joe] Biden a ‘47-year swamp creature’ who had ‘accomplished nothing’ and supported a ‘radical, socialist Green New Deal’.” Such language attacking Biden’s long career in the Senate and as vice-president to Barack Obama was used by Trump advisers. In October, for example, senior adviser Jason Miller told reporters: “The contrast between a 47-year swamp creature in Joe Biden and a businessman in President Trump has been a major theme of this campaign and I would expect it to be so through election day.” Bender reports that the Trump campaign thought the Hannity ad “so useless that they limited it to exactly one show: Hannity … If Trump and Hannity watched the spot on television – and were satisfied enough to stop asking about the commercial – that seemed to be the best result of the ad.

Burton’s Biscuits is being acquired by the Ferrero Group (whose Ferrero Rocher adverts at the ambassador’s reception are still fondly remembered here). Burton’s employs around 2,000 people at six production facilities at Blackpool, Dorset, Edinburgh, Livingston, Llantarnam and Isle of Arran, and dates back to 1935. Headquartered in St. Albans, is being sold by the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board after eight years. Ferrero, which also makes Nutella and Kinder chocolates, says the deal will expand its sweet biscuits offering, having previously acquired Biscuits Delacre, Kelsen Group and Fox’s. Nick Jansa, senior managing director at Ontario Teachers’ , says Burton’s is ‘well positioned’ for success: “We’re proud to have supported Burton’s and overseen the significant growth of this leading UK biscuit manufacturer. Since our investment, Burton’s has implemented key organic growth initiatives and completed a number of strategic acquisitions to further strengthen its portfolio and manufacturing capability. Eurozone inflation is now (just) above target for the first time since October 2018. Charles Hepworth, investment director at GAM Investments, says the European Central Bank should welcome this move (it’s been trying stimulate prices and ward of deflation). Consumers probably won’t share this feeling, but Hepworth doesn’t think higher inflation will be permanent. The resurgent demand coming about from partial reopening of the bloc’s economy highlights the ongoing supply constraints in some parts of the economy. The ECB however will be more than pleased that inflation is at its implied target level, although how long it persists is open to huge debate, as witnessed in volatility seen across markets since the spectre of higher inflation emerged this year. Higher input costs will inevitably lead to a modest inflation overshoot in the short term but the continuation of monetary largesse, which doesn’t seem to be looking to be withdrawn any time soon, is arguably the deciding factor on the medium-term inflation rate. We see higher inflation as being a transient one-off supply led issue and not something that should spook investors in the medium term. Inflation across the eurozone has accelerated above the European Central Bank’s target, as rising prices hit consumers. The annual eurozone consumer prices index rose by 2% in May, flash data shows, up from 1.6% in April. Energy prices were the biggest factor, surging by 13.1% over the last year (as crude prices recover from their slump early in the pandemic). Service sector firms also raised their prices, with annual services inflation rising to 1.1% from 0.9% in April, while non-energy industrial goods rose 0.7% and food, alcohol &amp; tobacco were 0.6% higher than a year ago. This takes inflation above the ECB’s inflation target of ‘close to, but below 2%’, and could intensify pressure from more hawkish policymakers to slow its pandemic bond-buying stimulus programme. Eurostat has also reported that unemployment across the eurozone fell in April, to 8.0% from 8.1% in March. However, that’s still higher than a year ago (it was 7.3% in April 2020), due to the heavy job losses caused by Covid-19. That shows that the economic damage of the pandemic has yet to heal (especially with the eurozone falling into recession last quarter). It adds: Eurostat estimates that 15.380 million men and women in the EU, of whom 13.030 million in the euro area, were unemployed in April 2021. Compared with March 2021, the number of persons unemployed decreased by 165 000 in the EU and by 134 000 in the euro area. Compared with April 2020, unemployment rose by 1.406 million in the EU and by 1.275 million in the euro area. UK factories might growing even faster if they weren’t constrained by supply chain problems, says Mike Thornton, partner and head of manufacturing at accountancy giant RSM. He says supply shortages are now biting, as firms consume stocks built up ahead of the Brexit deadline at the end of 2020. ‘It’s great to see another increase in the latest CIPS Manufacturing PMI to a record high of 65.6 from 60.9; and reinforces the important role that UK manufacturing will play in the economic recovery this year. ‘It also demonstrates the resilience of manufacturers in a chaotic market; but supply chain disruption is really starting to bite now. Not only is there a shortage of certain components which is stalling production, but the cost of shipping certain products or materials is through the roof. This extra expense is the last thing manufacturers need as they try to trade out of unprecedented times. ‘Brexit stockpiling has cushioned the blow for many manufacturers at the start of the year; but as stocks dwindle and supply chain disruption remains, we could see further pressure on input costs and production – pushing prices up even further for consumers. ‘It’s such a shame that post-Brexit and pandemic supply chain disruption could curb economic growth at a time when manufacturers are looking to maximise the opportunity of pent up consumer spend.’ The Office for National Statistics has reported that the number of companies citing Brexit as their main challenge rose at the start of the year – replacing Covid-19 as the biggest problem for the largest proportion of firms. Here’s a good snap summary of the purchasing manager survey, from EY Item Club’s Howard Archer: By surging to 65.6 in May, the UK manufacturing PMI has burst above July 1994’s previous record high of 61.0, as well as April’s reading of 60.9. It’s now signalled an improvement in the factory sector for the last 12 months, following the first lockdown in April and May 2020. A surge of new orders has helped Britain’s factory sector to post a record increase in activity last month, as the easing of lockdown restrictions boosted demand. The UK Manufacturing PMI jumped to 65.6 in May, up from 60.9 in April, and the highest since the survey began in 1992 (any reading over 50 shows growth). IHS Markit, which compiles the survey, reports that conditions in the manufacturing sector improved at an unprecedented rate in May. Output growth strengthened, and new orders rose at the quickest pace on record. Markit says: Companies linked new order growth to rising business confidence, the further re-opening of the UK economy and reduced issues relating to COVID-19. New export orders also rose at a survey-record pace in May, amid reports of stronger demand from the EU, the US and China. But while large companies saw record gains in new export work, small firms only saw a smaller rise. Employment jumped at a record pace, with manufacturers taking on staff to handle high levels of pent-up demand. Supply disruption was a growing problem too, with companies reporting shortages of electronics, plastics and metals, transport delays and higher demand for raw materials. This drove up input costs at a record pace, leading to an unprecedented rise in output prices too, in a further sign that inflationary pressures are building. Rob Dobson, Director at IHS Markit, said UK factories benefitted from the easing of lockdown restrictions, as vaccine rollouts help economies unlock. But he also warns that consumers will see higher prices, as the jump in input costs is passed on. “The UK PMI surged to an unprecedented high in May, as record growth of new orders and employment supported one of the steepest increases in production volumes in the near 30-year survey history. Growth is being boosted by the unlocking of economies from COVID restrictions and ongoing vaccination programs. This is being felt across the globe, as highlighted by a record rise in new export business during the latest survey month. The corollaries of this strong upsurge in industrial activity are increased strain on supply chains and a build-up of price pressures. Supplies of inputs into manufacturers and finished goods on to clients are both being severely disrupted by raw material shortages, port issues, COVID restrictions, post-Brexit difficulties and market forces as demand outstrips supply. Suppliers’ delivery times subsequently lengthened to one of the greatest extents on record, while input costs and selling prices both rose at unprecedented rates. With little sign of supply pressures receding, these price rises will become more visible to consumers.” Back on the housing market boom... the Resolution Foundation flags up that prices are rising fastest in the less populated parts of the UK, confirming that the ‘race for space’ is happening. Resolution’s research, released last month, found that house prices in the least-densely populated areas of the UK have risen almost twice as much as those in the most-densely populated areas over the past year. Demand for rural properties, or those with a garden, have jumped during the lockdown and the move to more home working. Domino’s Pizza is aiming to hire 5,000 chefs and delivery drivers, as consumers’ appetite for takeaways remains strong, at a time when the hospitality industry is battling staff shortages. Britain’s biggest pizza delivery chain said it had recruited just over 8,000 people in 2020 to meet demand, including hairdressers, taxi drivers and event managers who were not able to work as usual during lockdown. However, as Covid restrictions ease, some of Domino’s pandemic recruits are returning to their previous roles. As a result, the chain needs more staff for its 1,100 UK branches, most of which are run by franchisees. The firm has previously announced plans to open a further 200 outlets. Domino’s search for new employees comes amid warnings from the hospitality industry that it is facing a staffing crisis, with businesses trying to fill thousands of vacancies. Domino’s was “overwhelmed by the response from people of all walks of life” during last year’s recruitment drive, said Nicola Frampton, operations director at Domino’s UK. Frampton added. “I’m proud we were able to play a part by offering people the opportunity to continue working and earning when times were tough. But as people start to reunite, customer demand is showing no signs of slowing and so we’re now looking for 5,000 new recruits.” Here’s the full story: UK sub-prime lender Amigo is facing insolvency after the UK high court rejected a controversial rescue plan last week. Amigo told the City this morning that it will not appeal the court’s ruling, which concluded that its proposal to cut compensation payouts to customers for mis-selling loans was unfair. Amigo added that its board are considering all options, including insolvency, saying: The Board of Amigo continues to consider all options, which includes insolvency, and whether it might be possible and appropriate, given the cost of a scheme, to promote another scheme of arrangement to avoid insolvency. The UK’s financial watchdog, the FCA, opposed the original scheme of arrangement proposed by Amigo, which charges 49.9% interest and requires borrowers to provide a friend or family member to act as a guarantor for a loan. Under the plan, the compensation pool for those missold loans was capped while directors could earn £7m in long-term bonuses. Gary Jennison, chief executive officer of Amigo, said today: “Without a scheme, Amigo faces insolvency as it will be unable to satisfy its customer compensation claims as well as meeting the legally binding funding obligations owed to its secured creditors. The Board is committed to finding the best solution it can for Amigo’s customers and other stakeholders and will be working with its stakeholders, including the FCA, to achieve that solution as quickly as it can.” Amigo shares are down 8% this morning at around 7.6p, near to its record lows, having halved last week after the court ruling. It floated on the stock market in 2018 at 275p... The FTSE 100 index has jumped 1% this morning, amid hopes of a strong recovery from the pandemic. The blue-chip FTSE 100 index is currently up 75 points to 7097 points, near to the pandemic highs hit last month, with almost every stock gaining ground. Mining companies are leading the risers, with iron ore jumping today amid reports that China could be relaxing recent restrictions on steelmakers in its Tangshan region. The weaker dollar is also pushing up commodity prices, boosting Anglo American (+4.5%), Rio Tinto (+4%), Glencore (+3.4%) and BHP Group (+3.4%). Housebuilders such as Persimmon (+2.4%), Barratt Development (+1.7%) and Taylor Wimpey (+1.2%) are also rallying, after Nationwide reported that house prices jumped sharply again in May. AJ Bell financial analyst Danni Hewson says: “Robust figures from the housing market lifted the housebuilding sector while miners were in demand as commodity prices resumed an upwards trajectory. “The FTSE’s rise was all the more impressive when you consider it came against the backdrop of a recovery-inspired rally in sterling. A strong pound dulls the relative worth of the overseas earnings which dominate the index. Europe’s Stoxx 600 share index has hit a new record high this morning, rising by over 0.8% to 450.79 points. The eurozone manufacturing PMI has hit a new record high, as factory activity surged and inflationary pressures build up. Data firm IHS Markit has reported that its eurozone manufacturing purchasing manager’s index, which tracks activity across the sector, hit 63.1 in May, up from April’s 62.9. That’s its highest reading since the survey began in 1997 (any reading over 50 shows growth). Firms reported a slight slowdown in output and new orders, but growth rates remained near the record levels set earlier this year. There was also a record deterioration in vendor delivery times, as suppliers struggled to meet demand, which pushed up raw materials costs and forced companies to hike their own prices. Markit says: On the price front, average input costs again rose substantially, with the rate of inflation hitting an unprecedented level in line with widespread product shortages. Boosted by strong market demand, manufacturers took advantage of improved pricing power by raising their own charges at the fastest rate in more than 18 years of data availability. Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit, says the data suggests the eurozone will grow strongly this summer, and also see a sharp rise in inflation: “Eurozone manufacturing continues to grow at a rate unprecedented in almost 24 years of survey history, the PMI breaking new records for a third month in a row. Surging output growth adds to signs that the economy is rebounding strongly in the second quarter. “However, May also saw record supply delays, which are constraining output growth and leaving firms unable to meet demand to a degree not previously witnessed by the survey In the financial markets, sterling has hit its highest level against the US dollar in three years. The pound traded as high as $1.4248 early this morning, its highest level since April 2018 (which was the highest since the 2016 EU referendum). This rally comes despite concerns about a potential third wave of Covid-19, due to rising cases of the new variant, called B.1.617.2, Bloomberg reports that traders are betting that the UK’s fast vaccine rollout will help the recovery gain traction: “The pound is favored because the progress of vaccination puts the U.K. closer to economic normalization than other countries,” said Toshiya Yamauchi, chief manager for foreign-exchange margin trading at Ueda Harlow Ltd. in Tokyo. “Sterling could climb toward $1.45.” Economic optimism has also lifted sterling recently, with consumer confidence strengthening, retail sales rising and company output picking up as lockdown restrictions were eased. Yesterday, the OECD predicted that the UK economy would expand by 7.2% this year, a strong bounceback, which would be the fastest since 1941. The dollar, though, has been pushed down by the huge US stimulus spending packages and the Federal Reserve’s pledge not to tighten monetary policy until it sees more progress on unemployment. Last week it hit a three-year low against China’s yuan, despite Beijing’s efforts to avoid its currency strengthening too quickly (which could hit export growth). The shortage of larger, more rural houses on the market is helping to push up prices strongly, says Nicky Stevenson, managing director at national estate agent group Fine &amp; Country.: “Many current buyers are those who delayed a move last year and would have been forgiven for thinking that competition would have cooled by now. Instead, they find themselves in an even tighter race as demand continues to outstrip supply. The buyers driving the market higher are still those looking for more space. Forever homes are still the order of the day and buyers are more than willing to do everything in their power to secure what they truly desire. “There just aren’t enough of these larger properties coming onto the market in the right areas and there’s no sign this imbalance is going to resolve itself in time to suppress strong growth over the summer.” But Guy Harrington, CEO of residential lender Glenhawk, predicts that the pace of growth will slow, especially if a third wave of Covid-19 cases hits the UK. “The disconnect between the UK housing market and economic reality appears as great as ever. Government stimulus has created a false sense of consumer confidence. Iain McKenzie, CEO of The Guild of Property Professionals, says there’s a ‘frenzy’ in the housing market, with some buyers bolstered by lockdown savings: “At a time when much of the country seems to be enjoying a sense of normality once again, we would expect the property market to follow suit. Today’s figures show that the market didn’t get the memo. The frenzy to snap up a property at the tail end of a pandemic is showing no signs of stopping, with double digit growth in house prices throughout May - the highest we have seen in the best part of a decade. “The success of the stamp duty holiday has certainly played its part, as well as the savings many have made while working from home. “With a record-breaking new average house price, which has grown almost £24,000 over the past 12 months, it’s worth thinking about how your potential savings might not outweigh the inflated price of your new home. “It is still crucial that prospective buyers go into the process with a sound understanding of the market and what they want from a new property. “As demand in the market increases, the extra competition creates a fear of missing out that can distract buyers from the fundamentals. It’s important not to let the current property frenzy draw attention away from what you are really looking for.” Nationwide also predicts that house prices could “accelerate further” in the coming months. The ‘race for space’, record low interest rates, and the stamp duty holiday (which will fall from £500,000 to £250,000 at the end of June, and finish three months later) could all drive activity, making it even harder for first-time buyers to get onto the housing ladder. But the market could then slow, if the end of the furlough scheme pushed up unemployment. Chief economist Robert Gardner explains: “Housing market activity is likely to remain fairly buoyant over the next six months as a result of the stamp duty extension and additional support for the labour market included in the Budget, especially given continued low borrowing costs, improving credit availability and with many people still motivated to move as a result of changing housing preferences in the wake of the pandemic. “With the stock of homes on the market constrained, there is scope for annual house price growth to accelerate further in the coming months, especially given the low base for comparison in early summer last year. Further ahead, the outlook for the market is far more uncertain. If unemployment rises sharply towards the end of the year as most analysts expect, there is scope for activity to slow, perhaps sharply, though even this could potentially be offset by ongoing shifts in housing preferences, if current trends are maintained. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The UK housing boom continues to run, with house price inflation accelerating again as the pandemic spurs people to move to larger properties in more rural areas. Figures released by Nationwide this morning show that annual house price growth jumped to 10.9% in May, up from 7.1%/year in April, pushing the new average price to a new peak. It says: Annual house price growth rises to 10.9%, the highest level in nearly seven years Prices up 1.8% month-on-month, following a 2.3% rise in April New record average price of £242,832, up £23,930 over the past twelve months Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist, says the housing market has seen a “complete turnaround over the past twelve months” since the first lockdown temporarily froze the market, with transactions reaching a record high of 183,000 in March: Gardner adds that Nationwide’s research shows that pressure for more space, or a garden, is the primary factor driving the market this spring. “Amongst homeowners surveyed at the end of April that were either moving home or considering a move, more than two thirds (68%) said this would have been the case even if the stamp duty holiday had not been extended. It is shifting housing preferences which is continuing to drive activity, with people reassessing their needs in the wake of the pandemic. Nationwide says the ‘race for space’ continues to drive demand. Of those moving or considering a move, around a third (33%) were looking to move to a different area, while nearly 30% were doing so to access a garden or outdoor space more easily, according to an online survey of consumers. Gardner adds: “Over a third (36%) of those surveyed said they were more likely to consider enhancing their home as a result of Covid19, with nearly half (46%) of these looking to add or maximise space. Faster broadband was another factor, with the move to home working and home schooling during lockdown showing the value of a good web connection. Nationwide’s results will interest the Bank of England, which is carefully monitoring Britain’s booming housing market as it weighs up the possibility that a rapid recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic will lead to a sustained period of inflation. In an interview with the Guardian today, deputy governor Sir Dave Ramsden said the Bank expected price pressures to be temporary but he and his colleagues on Threadneedle Street’s monetary policy committee were aware of the risks. Ramsden, the deputy governor responsible for markets and banking, said: “There is a risk that demand gets ahead of supply and that will lead to a more generalised pick-up in inflationary pressure. That’s something we are absolutely going to guard against. We are looking carefully at the housing market and a raft of real-term indicators.” Also coming up today Surveys of factory purchasing managers in the eurozone, UK and US are expected to show strong growth last month, and squeezed supply chains pushing up prices. Oil ministers from the Opec+ group will hold a video call today to assess the latest developments in the global markets. They’re expected to stick to the existing pace of gradually easing oil supply curbs, as demand picks up -- which has already pushed UK petrol prices up for six months in a row. Crude prices have risen overnight, with Brent crude rising over $70 per barrel.

Senior government ministers and health officials met on Tuesday night to discuss a potential extension of the state’s seven-day lockdown into the weekend. New South Wales health authorities at the same time revealed a positive Melbourne case visited Jervis Bay, Hyams Beach, Vincentia and Goulburn while potentially infectious on 23 and 24 May. “This is stranger-to-stranger transmission” being experienced in Melbourne, the Victorian Covid-19 testing commander, Jeroen Weimar, said earlier on Tuesday, with 54 active cases now in the state including three new cases identified overnight. “We have at least four incidents where people unknown to each other before have transmitted to each other. What we’re seeing now is people are brushing past each other in a small shop, they are going to a display home, they are looking at phones in a Telstra shop, and this relatively speaking fleeting contact [is enough to spread the virus]. “That is very different from what we have seen before. This is the biggest outbreak we’ve seen in Australia this year. It is certainly the fastest-moving outbreak we’ve seen anywhere in Australia for a long time. I’m not taking this lightly.” Every case has been genomically linked to the original case, a man who caught the virus on his final day in hotel quarantine in South Australia on 4 May before returning to his home in Wollert, Victoria, the same day. When someone tests positive a sample of the virus is sent to a laboratory where staff identify the code of the virus from that person. This code is compared with the code from other cases as they are identified. Samples with the same code are all linked as part of the same genomic cluster. Every exposure site the Wollert man had visited had been confirmed and checked repeatedly, Weimar said, including his workplace, with contacts of concern tested and isolating. But while all of the cases had been linked genomically, health workers had not been able to determine how the virus spread from the man to Whittlesea, where there are 28 positive cases, and Port Melbourne, where there are 23 positive cases. “We are absolutely clear that there is a missing link between this individual and the subsequent outbreak that we have seen and Whittlesea and Port Melbourne,” Weimar said. He said he was concerned individuals who had only fleeting contact with the Wollert man may have caught the virus, even if they had not been to one of the exposure sites. More than 300 potential exposure sites have been identified. “We are now keen to start to drain the swamp to see what else is out there,” Weimar said. “Is there anybody else out there we haven’t caught? Is there anybody else not caught by exposure sites?” After a worker at the BlueCross Sunshine aged care facility was confirmed to have tested positive on Monday, all other staff and residents at the home had been tested and had returned negative results, said Victoria’s health minister, Martin Foley. He also said there had been no further positive tests from the Arcare aged care facility at Maidstone, where a staff member and a resident had tested positive. But the aged care cases raised questions on Monday about why all aged care staff and residents had not yet been vaccinated and why the federal government had been allowing staff to work across multiple sites until the outbreak. The federal minister for aged care, Richard Colbeck, revealed in health estimates on Tuesday morning that he could not say how many aged care workers had been vaccinated because the government had only recently begun collating that data. The federal government is responsible for private aged care and the vaccination of those residents and workers. Foley said on Tuesday that the Victorian government would step in to make sure all workers and residents in aged care, and people with a disability, were vaccinated more swiftly as part of a blitz. From Wednesday 2 June to Sunday 6 June, workers in private aged care facilities and the residential disability sector will be given priority access at walk-in vaccination hubs between 9am and 4pm when they present evidence of their employment. While the commonwealth will continue to be responsible for in-reach in disability residential settings, Victoria will also work with providers to support access to state-run vaccination sites to increase the current low level of vaccinations. “We will keep doing all we can to ensure we are making it as easy and as fast as possible for healthcare and aged care workers in the public or private sector to get vaccinated as quickly as they can,” Foley said. “My understanding is the commonwealth have, through private contractors, committed to ramping up their in-reach services into those disability services. I understand that doesn’t cover staff, hence our announcement today that we want to prioritise those staff in our next five-day blitz in this area.” NSW Health on Tuesday night said a positive case visited venues in Jervis Bay, Hyams Beach, Vincentia and Goulburn while potentially infectious. They drove back to Melbourne on 24 May and developed symptoms on 25 May. They were tested on 31 May. Meanwhile, a man has tested positive while in hotel quarantine in Perth, with authorities urgently investigating how he was infected. The WA health department believes the virus was transmitted between two guests staying in neighbouring rooms at the Pan Pacific hotel. Genome sequencing data confirmed they shared the same sequence of the virus. The chief health officer, Andrew Robertson, said a man flew into Perth from Colombia via the US on May 21 and tested positive on 23 May. The guest next door had arrived in Perth on 16 May and tested positive on his day 13 test. The deputy chief health officer, Robyn Lawrence, said the two guests were staying in rooms at the end of a corridor. She said recent cases of transmission in hotels elsewhere in Australia had also occurred between people staying at the end of corridors. Lawrence said it was safe for other guests to leave the quarantine hotel because they were deemed far enough away from the rooms to not be at risk. “They’re being followed up daily, with public health calling them every day to make sure they are not developing any symptoms,” she said.","charCount":"6495","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/melissa-davey\">Melissa Davey</a>"},{"headline":"Coronavirus live news: Germany downgrades Covid risk level; Heathrow opens separate ‘red list’ terminal","standfirst":"<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2021/jun/01/coronavirus-live-news-peru-death-toll-more-than-doubles-after-review-who-renames-variants?page=with:block-60b5f79f8f086d71cc160d2b#block-60b5f79f8f086d71cc160d2b\">German experts say risk now ‘high’, down from ‘very high’</a>; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2021/jun/01/coronavirus-live-news-peru-death-toll-more-than-doubles-after-review-who-renames-variants?page=with:block-60b5e8d38f08d486a77192b9#block-60b5e8d38f08d486a77192b9\">Heathrow airport begins processing arrivals from ‘red list’ countries in separate terminal</a><br></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/jun/01/trial-allowing-vaccinated-australians-to-travel-overseas-could-start-in-six-weeks\">Trial allowing vaccinated Australians to travel overseas could start soon</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/31/if-india-variant-starts-a-third-wave-englands-covid-rules-may-have-to-stay\">Analysis: If India variant starts a third wave, England’s Covid rules may have to stay</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/31/eu-plans-to-lift-covid-quarantine-rules-for-vaccinated-from-1-july\">EU plans to lift Covid quarantine rules for vaccinated from 1 July</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2021/jun/01/uk-covid-live-news-coronavirus-third-wave-indian-variant-boris-johnson\">UK Covid updates - live</a><br></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul>","trailText":"German experts say risk now ‘high’, down from ‘very high’; Heathrow airport begins processing arrivals from ‘red list’ countries in separate terminal","byline":"Kaamil Ahmed (now); Martin Belam and Helen Livingstone (earlier)","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"55d2eb3289b6f55e804361c0458374a58f1479cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/55d2eb3289b6f55e804361c0458374a58f1479cb/0_835_4440_2663/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People wait to be inoculated against Covid-19 at the Babelsberg vaccination centre in Potsdam near Berlin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People wait to be inoculated against Covid-19 at the Babelsberg vaccination centre in Potsdam near Berlin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sören Stache/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<div id=\"block-60b610ed8f082e80569f2c01\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-01T11:19:26.437Z\">12.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Poland to begin vaccinations of 12-to-15 year olds from 7 June</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Reuters are reporting that Poland will offer Covid-19 vaccinations to children aged 12-15 from 7 June.

It is the first time Terminal 3 has been used since April 2020, when it was closed to save costs amid the collapse in demand for travel.<br></p> <p>Heathrow plans to move its new facility for processing red list arrivals to Terminal 4 “as soon as operationally possible”.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-06-01T08:19:02.740Z\">at 9.19am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-60b5e4a88f086d71cc160c59\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-01T07:45:00.316Z\">8.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The pressure to get England’s Covid restrictions dropped on 21 June is coming from several quarters, not least those sectors of the hospitality industry that are still unable to open their doors.</p> <p>CEO of the Night Time Industries Association, Michael Kill, has been pushing for earlier clarification of when reopening might happen.

A key quality is that they resist change: they attempt to fix for us an abiding sense of what exactly has happened. They can be many things: columns, tombs, plaques, cenotaphs, village halls, even housing. But who are they for? The people who suffered, their families, the wider public or future generations?</p> <p>At some point, inevitably, there will be an official, national memorial of the pandemic in the UK (as well as many more, surely, at local and international levels). What, then, should it look like? It will have to contend with how messy the past year has been – the death, the sorrow, the fear, but also the ensuing political and social division. Perhaps through all of that, memorialisation can play a therapeutic role.</p> <p>Memorials naturally remove some of the complexity of the past, replacing it with something smoother, better suited to a broad audience: the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/from-the-archive-blog/2020/nov/10/the-funeral-of-the-unknown-warrior-november-920\">tomb of the Unknown Warrior</a> doesn’t address one specific loss, so it can talk of all loss. Because of this universal ambition it is vital public memorials hit the right tone – being both honest and broadly interpretable, tending to avoid friction. As a result, though, memorials can feel as if they don’t talk to you directly or seem too vague. But at a time when narratives are brutally contested, it seems unlikely that a pandemic memorial will avoid controversy, no matter how skilful the architect.</p> <p><strong>Read more here: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/01/what-should-britains-memorial-covid-pandemic-look-like\">Eddie Blake – What should Britain’s memorial to the Covid pandemic look like?</a></strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/01/what-should-britains-memorial-covid-pandemic-look-like\">What should Britain’s memorial to the Covid pandemic look like? | Eddie Blake</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60b5d8288f088d8c3178f3a9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-01T06:49:42.786Z\">7.49am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Prof Adam Finn, from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, is a second expert in the UK on the airwaves today warning against further easing of domestic restrictions on 21 June.

are reporting that Poland will offer Covid-19 vaccinations to children aged 12-15 from 7 June. Michal Dworczyk, the minister in charge of the country’s vaccination programme, announced the move this morning. The European Commission on Friday authorized the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine for use in children as young as 12. The Italian government has allocated €50m to help treat the estimated 164,000 people suffering from serious health problems associated with ‘long Covid’. The money will be used for regular check-ups, including of the heart, lungs and kidneys, of patients until the end of 2023 as part of a strategy also aimed at allowing medics to research the long-term impact of the virus. More than a third of Italians suffering from serious symptoms of long-Covid are from Lombardy, the region hardest-hit by the pandemic. Antonio Pisani, a neurologist at the Mondino research centre, told Il Sole 24 Ore that the risk of neurological disorders is high. Among the most common symptoms he sees among patients are ongoing fatigue, dizziness and difficulty concentrating. He said there were also signs that the virus could predispose people to diseases including Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s. “I had two patients who, before March 2020, had never visited a neurologis … a month ago one was diagnosed with Parkinson’s and the other Alzheimer’s. Therefore it’s as if Covid was an accelerator for a disease that was already there but had not yet presented itself.” Delivery to the Philippines of the first batches of a promised 17m doses of AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine made in Thailand has been delayed by several weeks, a Philippine presidential adviser has said. The delay raises questions about AstraZeneca’s vaccine distribution plan in Southeast Asia, which depend on 200m doses made by Siam Bioscience, a company owned by Thailand’s king that is making vaccines for the first time. Joey Concepcion, a presidential adviser who has been coordinating vaccine procurement with the Philippine government and private sector, told Reuters that AstraZeneca had informed him delivery of the first batch of 1.3m doses would have to be pushed back from the third week of June to mid-July and also reduced to 1.17m doses. Concepcion said he was in touch daily with AstraZeneca and was told there were delays in Thai production. “It is a new plant they are running … that is how it is when you start a new plant,” he said. AstraZeneca has faced legal action in Europe over a failure to deliver supplies as promised. Yemen’s Huthi rebels, who control most of the country’s north including the capital Sanaa, have been blocking international efforts to supply Covid vaccines, Human Rights Watch said. The New York-based group accused Huthi leaders of suppressing information about both the dangers of Covid and the prevalence of the disease in territory under their control. “The deliberate decision of the Huthi authorities to keep the real number of cases of Covid-19 under wraps and their opposition to vaccines are putting Yemeni lives at risk,” said HRW’s deputy Middle East director Michael Page. “Pretending Covid-19 does not exist is not a mitigation strategy and will only lead to mass suffering. “Given the weakened healthcare system in Yemen, Huthi authorities should at least ensure transparency so that civilians living in their areas can understand the scale of the pandemic and facilitate an international vaccination plan that meets the needs on the ground.” AFP report that Yemen received 360,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine on 31 March, the first of 1.9 million doses to be delivered this year through the Covax programme for poorer countries. However, the rebels’ failure to cooperate with the World Health Organization and the Yemeni government has prevented any vaccines from reaching the north, HRW said citing a medical source with “direct knowledge of the circumstances”. As a result, vaccinations have only been occurring in the government-held south. HRW quoted Huthi officials as dismissing Covid-19 as a “conspiracy”. “America bears the primary responsibility for the Covid-19 epidemic,” it quoted rebel leader Abdul Malik al-Huthi, as saying in a televised speech last year. Heathrow airport in London has begun processing arrivals from red list countries in a dedicated terminal following concerns about them mixing with other passengers. Travellers arriving from red list nations on direct flights are being taken to Terminal 3. Russia has announced the resumption of air travel with Britain and a number of other countries – Austria, Hungary, Lebanon, Luxembourg, Croatia, Mauritius, and Morocco – which had been suspended due to coronavirus restrictions. Peru has revised its official Covid-19 death toll to 180,764, nearly triple the previous official figure of 69,342, following a government review that shows the severity of the outbreak in the country. The World Health Organisation has recommended a new set of names for the coronavirus “variants of concern”, which will be known by letters of the Greek alphabet. Alpha is the new name for UK/Kent (B.1.1.7), Beta for South Africa (B.1.351), Gamma for Brazil (P.1) and Delta for the variant first detected in India (B.1.617.2). Chinese authorities in Guangdong province have cancelled flights and locked down communities in response to what is believed to be the first community outbreak of the “Delta” or Indian variant in China. Malaysia has begun a tough nationwide lockdown to battle a worsening coronavirus outbreak. Of almost 2,800 deaths from Covid-19 recorded in the country of 32 million since the start of the pandemic, over 40 percent were in May alone. Taiwan has reported 13 new deaths from Covid-19, and 262 new cases. In a sign that authorities are also clearing the backlog of test results which had seen hundreds added to previous daily totals and caused difficulties in analysing any trends, there were just 65 new positive cases announced today. Germany’s Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious disease is to reduce the coronavirus risk level for the country to “high” from “very high”, health minister Jens Spahn said. A leading scientific adviser to the UK government has repeated calls to delay the 21 June lifting of restrictions by “a few weeks”, warning the coronavirus’s ability to adapt in the face of vaccines has still left the UK in a vulnerable position. Ireland will begin to gradually phase out temporary coronavirus-related jobless payments later this year while maintaining other income and business supports as the economy fully reopens, public expenditure minister Michael McGrath. Australians who have been vaccinated against Covid would be able to leave the country and return with less strict quarantine requirements under a plan that could be trialled within six weeks. Our community team are interested to hear about your experiences of travelling through Heathrow, now that London’s airport has opened up a terminal specifically to deal with arrivals from the so-called “red list” countries. If you’ve travelled and want to get in touch with them, you can find all the details here… Australians who have been vaccinated against Covid would be able to leave the country and return with less strict quarantine requirements under a plan that could be trialled within six weeks. The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, revealed the proposal in the Coalition party room on Tuesday following a question from Liberal MP Jason Falinski, who had asked whether vaccination could see people exempted from outbound and inbound travel restrictions. Australia shut its borders in March 2020 in response to the coronavirus pandemic imposing two weeks hotel quarantine on those arriving into the country. Outbound travel is also banned – which was upheld by the full federal court on Tuesday – although more than 140,000 Australian citizens and residents have travelled overseas for critical business, on compassionate grounds or for other exempted reasons. With Australia struggling to vaccinate its population by the end of 2021, there is pressure on the federal government to provide incentives to get the jab and to ease the travel ban that has separated families. About 40,000 Australians remain stranded overseas due to flight caps imposed as a result of limited hotel quarantine beds. Read more of Paul Karp’s report here: Trial allowing vaccinated Australians to travel overseas could start in six weeks This might be a useful ready-reckoner for some new language that you – and I – are going to need to get used to in the next few weeks, after the WHO recommended a new set of names for the coronavirus “variants of concern”. These are the four you need to know: Alpha - UK/Kent (B.1.1.7) Beta - South Africa (B.1.351) Gamma - Brazil (P.1) Delta - India (B.1.617.2) For ease of use to start with, I’ll try to make sure I am using all three ways of naming each variant until we all get more acquainted with the new terminology. There’s fuller details here: Covid-19 variants to be given Greek alphabet names to avoid stigma The proposed Copa América this summer is in some disarray, with reports that Brazil will replace hosts Argentina, just 13 days before it is due to start. “The Copa América 2021 will be played in Brazil,” an official Conmebol statement said. “Tournament start and end dates are confirmed. The venues and the fixtures will be announced by Conmebol in the next few hours.” The tournament, featuring 10 South American nations, had been due to be held in Argentina and Colombia with joint hosts for the first time in its 105-year history. Colombia was removed as a co-host on 20 May after a wave of protests demanding social and economic change spread across the country, and Argentina has followed. Now Reuters report that Chilean national soccer star Arturo Vidal has been diagnosed with Covid-19 and is in hospital in what appears to be a an isolated case as the squad readies itself for World Cup qualifying match against Argentina on 3 June. “He was diagnosed positive for Covid in the daily preventive exam performed today,” the team said in a statement late yesterday. The team plan to travel to Argentina for the game today. A quick Reuters snap here that Germany’s Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious disease is to reduce the coronavirus risk level for the country to “high” from “very high” as the situation improves, health minister Jens Spahn said on Tuesday. “We have grounds for optimism,” said Spahn at a news conference with the head of the RKI, Lothar Wieler, who said developments were improving but the pandemic was not yet over. Ireland will begin to gradually phase out temporary coronavirus-related jobless payments later this year while maintaining other income and business supports as the economy fully reopens, public expenditure minister Michael McGrath said today. Ireland is emerging from its third and longest lockdown having had one the strictest regimes in Europe for the last 15 months, leaving more than 300,000 people who lost their jobs claiming the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP). Local media reported that the PUP, which is paid out at a higher rate than regular jobless benefits, would be reduced from September and withdrawn by February 2022. “There won’t be a cliff edge in July, we will be looking at an extension of the PUP but also laying out a pathway towards the normalisation of our social welfare code and ultimately unwinding a payment that is pandemic related,” McGrath told national broadcaster RTE. “The changes will be gradual.” The number of people temporarily or permanently unemployed in Ireland stood at 22.4% at the end April, with around three in four on the PUP. McGrath said he expected that cohort to fall very significantly over coming weeks as the economy reopens. He added that additional supports for businesses reopening would be announced later today. Padraic Halpin reminds us for Reuters that the government allowed all shops to open for the first time this year two weeks ago with the hospitality sector to follow with limited capacity in coming days. Nicola Slawson has launched our UK live blog for the day, with the leads line being the warning that the country is in a “perilous moment”. Join her for the latest UK Covid news as it comes in today. I’ll be continuing here with the latest coronavirus news from around the world. Taiwan has reported 13 new deaths from Covid-19, and 262 new cases. In a sign that authorities are also clearing the backlog of test results which had seen hundreds added to previous daily totals and caused difficulties in analysing any trends, there were just 65 new positive cases announced today. The majority of the new cases remained in the north, with 166 in New Taipei city, 87 in Taipei city, and 23 in Taoyuan. Health and welfare minister Chen Shih-Chung said reinfection rates had declined thanks to the measures introduced over the past two weeks - and the community’s cooperation with them - but said it was still not time to relax. Chen the backlog of cases was expected to be cleared in the next day or two. The daily number of vaccinations has increased, but Taiwan still remains far behind other countries, with less than 2% of its population having received a shot. Taiwan’s problems with a Covid-19 vaccination drive are complicated, and involved accusations of geopolitical interference as well as of government bungling, but the important news from recent days is that the government is now allowing private companies, religious groups and local governments to arrange imports. Tech giant Foxconn and its billionaire founder Terry Gou have sought permission to buy 5 million vaccines from Germany’s BioNTech, to distribute among the general population. Gou said on Saturday they hope to airlift the shots from Germany to Taiwan without going via any middlemen. This has received a lukewarm reaction from the government. Chen expressed his gratitude to Gou and said the government was reviewing the application, adding that while it welcomes help in obtaining vaccines from companies and religious groups, Taiwan’s government has stipulated that only it can distribute the shots. Russia has announced the resumption of air travel with Britain and a number of other countries which had been suspended due to coronavirus restrictions. “Given the improvement of the epidemiological situation in the United Kingdom, a decision has been taken to resume regular air travel between Moscow and London from 2 June,” Russian health authorities said in a statement on Monday. Russia will also resume air travel with Austria, Hungary, Lebanon, Luxembourg, Croatia, Mauritius, and Morocco from 10 June, it said. Flights to Turkey, a major tourist destination for Russians, will remain suspended until at least 21 June. AFP note that since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, Russia’s borders have remained largely closed to foreigners. Heathrow has begun processing arrivals from red list countries in a dedicated terminal following concerns about them mixing with other passengers. Travellers arriving from red list nations on direct flights are being taken to Terminal 3. Passengers travelling to the UK on connecting flights from red list locations continue to transit through the airport alongside those from green and amber countries. The red list currently consists of 43 nations from which arrivals are deemed to present a high risk of importing coronavirus. Red list countries from where direct flights to the UK are permitted include India, the Philippines, Pakistan, Kenya and Bangladesh. Passengers arriving in the UK after being in one of those destinations during the previous 10 days must spend 11 nights in a quarantine hotel, costing 1,750 for solo travellers. The decision to separate arrivals on direct flights from red list destinations was welcomed by the GMB union, which had previously warned that “bottlenecks” are putting passengers and staff at risk. Heathrow insisted there were “several layers of protection to keep passengers and colleagues safe”, such as mandatory testing for all arrivals, segregation and ventilation. PA Media notes that an airport executive said in April that passengers are being forced to queue for up to six hours to be processed through immigration halls. It is the first time Terminal 3 has been used since April 2020, when it was closed to save costs amid the collapse in demand for travel. Heathrow plans to move its new facility for processing red list arrivals to Terminal 4 “as soon as operationally possible”. The pressure to get England’s Covid restrictions dropped on 21 June is coming from several quarters, not least those sectors of the hospitality industry that are still unable to open their doors. CEO of the Night Time Industries Association, Michael Kill, has been pushing for earlier clarification of when reopening might happen. He told Sky News: Nine out of 10 late-night businesses feel that veering off the roadmap would threaten their survival. Ninety-five per cent of businesses have already made financial commitments in terms of stock, staff and entertainment. So this is a key time, and the government really needs to step up and make it very clear exactly what their intentions are. The UK’s small businesses minister Paul Scully has been on LBC this morning reiterating the message from the government that people in the UK should use “caution” in the face of the growing number of cases of the “Delta” variant of coronavirus – the B.1.617.2 variant first detected in India. He stressed again that no decision would be taken until 14 June, saying: I know for some people that won’t be quick enough, but we’ve got to make sure that we are working with the latest data, accurate data. Scientists have to be able to go through this with a fine tooth comb, because it’s a really really important decision that affects so many people. Pressed about whether the country was in fact seeing increased hospitalisations and what the threat to the NHS currently was, he said: We’ve just got to make sure that we are looking forward to see what happens in the next few weeks and months in terms of that modelling, based on the data. Because what we do know is that when case rates go up, hospitalisations to date have also gone up. But the vaccination progress is still continuing with 63 million vaccinations and that is what is going to help us win this race. Eddie Blake writes for us this morning, asking what should Britain’s memorial to the Covid pandemic look like? Memorials aim to be an eloquent last word on an event. A key quality is that they resist change: they attempt to fix for us an abiding sense of what exactly has happened. They can be many things: columns, tombs, plaques, cenotaphs, village halls, even housing. But who are they for? The people who suffered, their families, the wider public or future generations? At some point, inevitably, there will be an official, national memorial of the pandemic in the UK (as well as many more, surely, at local and international levels). What, then, should it look like? It will have to contend with how messy the past year has been – the death, the sorrow, the fear, but also the ensuing political and social division. Perhaps through all of that, memorialisation can play a therapeutic role. Memorials naturally remove some of the complexity of the past, replacing it with something smoother, better suited to a broad audience: the tomb of the Unknown Warrior doesn’t address one specific loss, so it can talk of all loss. Because of this universal ambition it is vital public memorials hit the right tone – being both honest and broadly interpretable, tending to avoid friction. As a result, though, memorials can feel as if they don’t talk to you directly or seem too vague. But at a time when narratives are brutally contested, it seems unlikely that a pandemic memorial will avoid controversy, no matter how skilful the architect. Read more here: Eddie Blake – What should Britain’s memorial to the Covid pandemic look like? Prof Adam Finn, from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, is a second expert in the UK on the airwaves today warning against further easing of domestic restrictions on 21 June. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “There’s vulnerability across the country. The idea that somehow the job is done, is wrong. “We’ve still got a lot of people out there who’ve neither had this virus … nor yet been immunised, and that’s why we’re in a vulnerable position right now.” PA Media reports Finn added: “There are a lot of people who are very fed up about the idea of us even worrying about this. Since I’ve been saying in the last 24 hours that we should be cautious I’ve been getting lots of messages from people telling me to shut up basically. “But the truth is that a more infectious virus, which is what it looks like we’ve got, will reach people who are vulnerable – those who did not make a good response to the vaccine, those who have not yet had their doses – and that will be a problem for everyone because in the end it will be worse economically as well as for public health if we end up having to shut down again.” Chinese authorities in Guangdong province have cancelled flights and locked down communities in response to what is believed to be the first community outbreak of the “Delta” or Indian variant in China. Guangdong province had been reporting daily single figures of local cases, including asymptomatic cases, for more than a week, until the case load suddenly jumped to 23 on Monday, including three asymptomatic cases, and 11 on Tuesday. Most of Guandong’s cases are in the city of Guangzhou, with some in nearby Foshan, which has a population of 7.2 million. Authorities said all cases were found to be the strain commonly known as the Indian variant of the virus, now renamed by the WHO as the “Delta” variant. “In this race against the virus, we must run a bit ahead and run faster than before in order to block the spread of the virus and cut off the infection chain in time,” said Huang Guanglie, director of the Guangzhou municipal health commission. Guangzhou deputy mayor, Li Ming, said the strain had a short incubation period, a high viral load, and spread quickly. However she said that the trajectory was “under control”. In response hundreds of flights at the busy Guangdong Baiyun international airport have been cancelled, and authorities ordered some streets in the Liwan neighbourhood of Guangzhou city to isolate at home, with only one person per household allowed out to buy daily necessities. On Sunday, all 15.3 million Guangzhou residents were barred from leaving via bus, air or train without a green code on the health management app and a negative Covid test taken in the preceding 72 hours. Read more of Helen Davidson’s report here: China locks down part of Guangzhou amid outbreak of Indian Covid variant Malaysia has begun a tough nationwide lockdown to battle a worsening coronavirus outbreak, AFP reports, as countries across Southeast Asia struggle with a resurgence in cases driven by infectious variants. It writes, Much of the region escaped the pandemic’s first wave last year relatively unscathed by rapidly closing borders and introducing curbs. But countries from Thailand to Vietnam are being hammered by fresh surges, with efforts to quell outbreaks hampered by slow vaccine rollouts and populations weary of restrictions. Malaysia is among the worst hit. Of almost 2,800 deaths from Covid-19 recorded in the country of 32 million since the start of the pandemic, over 40 percent were in May alone. More than 570,000 infections have been reported, with a string of new daily records last week. As well as variants, the outbreak has been fanned by gatherings in the Muslim-majority country during the holy month of Ramadan and the Eid al-Fitr holiday, often in defiance of coronavirus rules. Under what authorities have termed a “total lockdown” in force from Tuesday, only essential businesses - such as supermarkets and medical clinics - can operate, people can only go outside for necessities, and most schools are closed. Travel between most parts of the country had already been banned for months. Just following up on Prof Ravi Gupta’s words there with a quick check on the UK government’s own coronavirus dashboard, and we can see that with data in from 31 May now, that the rolling seven-day averages of cases, deaths and hospitalisations are all up – all admittedly from a baseline much lower than was in the earlier peak of the second wave of the virus. You can have look for yourself here. A leading scientific adviser to the UK government has repeated calls to delay the 21 June lifting of restrictions by “a few weeks”, warning the coronavirus’s ability to adapt in the face of vaccines has still left the UK in a vulnerable position. Prof Ravi Gupta, a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), said the increased socialisation which has followed last month’s phase of restriction lifting could be expected to lead to “quite a lot” of hospital admissions. PA Media reports that he told ITV’s Good Morning Britain that while the nation had performed “amazingly well” in its vaccination programme, it was still too early “to put the vaccine straight up against the virus”. Gupta said a delay of a few weeks to the 21 June target could have a significant impact on Britain’s battle against the pandemic, and recommended it should be made clear to the public that it would be a temporary measure based on recent events, chiefly the emergence of the newly-designated “Delta variant”, which we had previously been calling the B.1.617.2 strain of the virus or the variant that was first detected in India. “Even a month delay could have a big impact on the eventual outcome of this,” said Prof Gupta. He continued: “As long as it’s clear to people this is not an unlimited extension of the lockdown but actually just a reassessment, that would be realistic. “Because we didn’t plan for the 617.2 variant when the initial roadmap was made, and actually things have gone really well except for the fact that we have this new variant to complicate things. “We must remember this is a virus that does adapt, and faced with vaccines it will eventually start to make mutations to avoid them even further, and then we could be in an even more precarious situation after that.” Vietnam is seeking to buy Covid-19 vaccine production technology and wants to build a plant to supply the Covax programme, Reuters reports, as the country tries to step up vaccinations to stem a new outbreak of infections. India and South Africa are among developing countries that have been pushing for an intellectual property waiver for Covid-19 vaccines. But even with a surprise US shift last month to support a waiver World Trade Organization talks on the issue on Monday failed to achieve a breakthrough. “Vietnam would build the plant and would like to receive the patent so it could supply vaccines to Covax, to other countries as well as to Vietnam,” the health ministry said in a statement, following a meeting with Covax representatives overnight. India has reported its lowest daily rise in new coronavirus infections since 8 April at 127,510 cases over the past 24 hours, while deaths rose by 2,795, Reuters reports. The South Asian nation’s tally of infections now stands at 28.2 million, while the death toll has reached 331,895, health ministry data showed. That’s it from me, Helen Livingstone, for today. I’m handing over to my colleague Martin Belam in London. Here’s a quick roundup of what’s been happening so far: Peru has revised its official Covid-19 death toll to 180,764, nearly triple the previous official figure of 69,342, following a government review that shows the severity of the outbreak in the country. As new coronavirus variants continue to be discovered, the World Health Organization has revealed new names, after the letters of the Greek alphabet, to simplify the discussion around the variants and avoid stigma. Australia’s drug regulator says it may refer anti-vaccination Facebook posts to federal police after anti-vaccine campaigners targeted an MP who posted about getting the jab. Australia’s federal court has rejected a bid by a rightwing thinktank to overturn the country’s ban on outbound travel. US gun sales spiked during the pandemic and continue to rise, with first-time buyers making up more than a fifth of those who purchased guns Germany has pledged to crack down on fraud in coronavirus test centres, after evidence that some have been claiming for more tests than they have carried out. Scientists are urging the government to speed up second doses of Covid vaccines and delay a decision on easing lockdown restrictions in England on 21 June in an effort to tackle the creeping spread of new cases. France has opened up vaccines to all adults a week before Germany, as Europe rushed to avoid another wave of infections caused by new virus variants. Vietnam has announced the suspension of incoming international flights to its capital and tightened restrictions in its biggest city. The inbound flight suspension to Hanoi will apply from 1-7 June. Travellers from the UK will have to provide “compelling reasons” to enter France from Monday, as French authorities tighten curbs to halt the spread of the Indian Covid variant. The European Commission has proposed that all EU countries gradually ease travel measures over the summer. School closures in England during the Covid lockdown badly damaged the mental health of mothers but had no impact on fathers’ wellbeing, research has found. Here’s a sobering, but important, feature by Guardian contributor V on the ways in which the pandemic has erased women’s rights and left them vulnerable to violence. She writes, All over the world, patriarchy has taken full advantage of the virus to reclaim power – on the one hand, escalating the danger and violence to women, and on the other, stepping in as their supposed controller and protector. And in more Australia-related Covid news, the country’s drug regulator is considering referring Covid vaccine misinformation posts to the federal police, after anti-vaccine campaigners targeted an MP who posted about getting the jab. In response to a viral post of Labor backbencher Julian Hill receiving his vaccine, numerous users posted false material purportedly from the Therapeutic Goods Administration wrongly claiming Covid-19 vaccines have caused more than 200 deaths. The figure they used was in fact the number of people who have died after receiving the vaccine, but apart from one case, none have been linked by the TGA to the vaccine. The TGA told Guardian Australia the alleged posting of the death counter was “particularly concerning” and it would consider referring it to the federal police. Australia’s federal court has rejected a bid by a rightwing thinktank to overturn the country’s ban on outbound travel. Libertyworks had argued that the health minister, Greg Hunt, has no power to impose a blanket rule stopping citizens from leaving the country. But Justices Anna Katzmann, Michael Wigney and Thomas Thawley dismissed the application and ordered Libertyworks to pay the commonwealth’s costs. The federal government had argued that, if successful, the case would have “driven a truck” through Hunt’s powers under the Biosecurity Act to impose measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19 during the global pandemic.

And he serves out to love to go 4-3 up. This ain’t over. De Minaur is now 3-2 up, two sets up and a break up against Travaglia. He’s looking good for the win now. A couple more results from today’s early matches. France’s Fiona Ferro is through, having beaten Liang En-shuo. And Ons Jabeur beat Yulia Putintseva 7-5 6-2. Another result in. Per AP Australian Open runner-up Jennifer Brady breezed past Anastasija Sevastova to reach the second round and match her best performance at the French Open. The 13th-seeded American, who has never reached the third round at Roland Garros, won 6-3, 6-3 after breaking Sevastova at love in the final game. Brady is not a clay specialist. She played only one tournament on the surface last year, losing her opening match at Roland Garros. She achieved her best result on clay earlier this season when she made it to the third round in Madrid in the buildup to the French Open. De Minaur is now two sets up on Travaglia, having won the second 6-4. He’s looking good for the win. Another Australian, Astra Sharma, won in the women’s singles, having beaten Irina Bara 7-6 6-2. Colin Watts gets in touch. As somebody who regularly faces disability-discrimination (rather than mental health) I can understand her plight; particularly when LBGT and racial issues are now (hopefully) becoming socially unacceptable. Much has already been said in the excellent blog by Jonathan Liew; the intolerance shewn by to Ms Osaka in respect of her health and well being beggars belief. Indeed I would suggest the French Tennis Federation’s actions could be tantamount to bullying with the ‘excuse of player contractual obligations’ being morally repugnant. If this was (say) a disability ‘contractual obligations’ would ultimately not be accepted. PS - I note the French Tennis Federation read a prepared statement Osaka their support but declined to accept questions from the media! With a typically crushing shot, Sakkari beats Zavatska 6-4 6-1, having really stepped it up in that second set. Sakkari is cruising into the second round, having twice broken Zavatska, she is serving at 4-0 up in the second set. Carla Suárez Navarro will return to the Roland Garros court today, having been forced to retire because of Hodgkin’s lymphoma, before making her comeback. She plays Sloane Stephens this afternoon. Sakkari has taken the first set against Zavatska 6-4. Liang En-shuo and Fiona Ferro, on Court Suzanne-Lenglen, has gone to a third set, both winning their sets by 6-1. Osaka has been receiving support back in Japan. Per Reuters. “The first thing to be considered is Ms. Osaka’s health. I wish her the earliest possible recovery,” Japan Tennis Association (JTA) Executive Director Toshihisa Tsuchihashi said in a statement. Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato told a news conference that he would “watch over her quietly” and there was concern on the streets of Tokyo for the woman who will be one of the faces of this year’s Olympic Games in the city. “I think she’s under a lot of pressure, more than we can imagine,” kimono dresser Tomomi Noguchi, 67, told Reuters.

She put out a statement and said ‘I need to take care of myself,’ and she’s been punished,” Skorji said. “I think she is courageous and needs support.” And De Minaur takes that first set 6-2, nice and easy so far for him. Japan’s Yasutaka Uchiyama has taken the first set 6-3 against the Italian, Marco Cecchinato. Per Reuters, on Osaka. There was some criticism of Roland Garros organisers for their handling of the matter. French Tennis Federation President Gilles Moretton read a prepared statement on Monday offering Osaka their support but the irony of him not taking questions, given the context of the row, was not lost on some. “So the FFT handled the Ms Osaka mental health concerns without empathy or sensitivity. Then the FFT President refuses to take questions at a presser. An own goal,” wrote former Australian tennis official Richard Ings. Alex de Minaur, the Australian 21st seed, has got himself in a commanding position in the first set against Stefano Travaglia. He’s winning 5-1, and serving well. It does look tres beau. Some big names from across sport have spoken out for Osaka. Martina Navratilova: I am so sad about Naomi Osaka. I truly hope she will be ok. As athletes we are taught to take care of our body, and perhaps the mental and emotional aspect gets short shrift. This is about more than doing or not doing a press conference. Good luck Naomi - we are all pulling for you! Billie-Jean King: It’s incredibly brave that Naomi Osaka has revealed her truth about her struggle with depression. Right now, the important thing is that we give her the space and time she needs. We wish her well.

As long as it’s clear to people this is not an unlimited extension of the lockdown but actually just a reassessment, that would be realistic.</p> <p>Because we didn’t plan for the 617.2 variant when the initial road map was made, and actually things have gone really well except for the fact that we have this new variant to complicate things.</p> <p>We must remember this is a virus that does adapt, and faced with vaccines it will eventually start to make mutations to avoid them even further, and then we could be in an even more precarious situation after that.</p> </blockquote> <p>Gupta said the UK was in “a really good position” in regard to its vaccination programme but caution remained crucial.</p> <p>He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The key thing here is that we’re almost there.</p> <p>The problem is we don’t want to put the vaccine straight up against the virus at a time when the vaccine coverage isn’t quite high enough; it’s not in young people, it’s not in schoolchildren, and that’s where the virus may potentially start circulating.</p> <p>We still have a lot of vulnerable people in the community who haven’t responded to the vaccine.</p> </blockquote> <p>Gupta said it was concerning that hospital admissions could be about to rise following last month’s easing of restrictions, at a time when hospitals were dealing with large backlogs of procedures and treatments delayed because of the pandemic.</p> <p>He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If we’re fully unlocked on the 21st of June, we have a situation where over the next few weeks there will be a lot of mixing, there will be gatherings, because people have been waiting to do these things for a long time.</p> <p>So we will get an excess of mixing, especially in younger groups, and that will lead to some hospitalisations... quite a lot, at a time when the NHS is trying to distance within hospitals, so it does take time to get things done there, and the added pressure of having Covid cases, some of which will be severe of course, is going to have an effect on morale and clinical care for everybody.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60b5f8c08f086d71cc160d3d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-01T09:07:43.360Z\">10.07am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Robert Dingwall</strong>, professor of sociology at Nottingham Trent University, said “critics” who have suggested that the June 21 easing should be delayed “can’t even agree on what delay they’d like”.</p> <p>He told Times Radio:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>By the time we get to June 21, everybody who is in the nine priority groups or the highest risk will have had both jabs, and would have had a period of time to consolidate the immunity.</p> <p>What are we going on with is really running into younger age groups who are intrinsically much lower risk. Many of the scientists who’ve been talking over the weekend simply haven’t adjusted their expectations to understand that - (for these people) Covid is a mild illness in the community.</p> <p>As the Director of Public Health Bolton was saying last week, the people who are going into hospital... it’s not like January, these are not desperately ill people.</p> <p>They’re people who need a little bit of extra support with oxygen, they need access to the dexamethasone treatment, which is very effective.</p> <p>They go in, stay in hospital for three or four days and they go out again.

In Rossendale the rate currently stands at 316.2 cases per 100,000 people, up week-on-week from 76.9; in Hyndburn it has risen from 66.6 to 162.9; and in Ribble Valley it is up from 24.6 to 129.7, PA news reports. These areas – all parts of Lancashire – are now recording some of the highest rates in the UK. Blackburn with Darwen, also in Lancashire, remains the area with the highest rate in the country: 416.2, up from 281.2. But while rates in Bolton have fallen week-on-week from 452.1 to 386.0, other areas of Greater Manchester, such as Bury (up from 61.3 to 96.9), Manchester (59.7 to 100.4) and Salford (32.1 to 98.1) are now recording a sharp rise. The latest case rates are for the seven days to May 27, and have been calculated by the PA news agency using Public Health England data. A pensioner, an NHS worker, and a gig economy worker are attempting to bring a legal challenge to the UK government’s charges for hotel quarantine regulations via judicial review. The rules state that UK and Irish citizens and residents who wish to return to England from “red-list” countries must pay an upfront cost of £1,750 to quarantine in a government-designated hotel, and over £3,000 for a family of four. The claimants, who are raising funds via CrowdJustice, argue that the charges breach international law, the World Health Organisation’s international health regulations, as well as equalities and human rights law. There is currently no discretion for people travelling for compassionate or emergency reasons and there is no way for people to pay a reduced fee. The only exemption to upfront payment is a deferred payment plan over a maximum of 12 months which is reserved for people facing emergency financial hardship. Law firm PGMBM has taken the case on a pro bono basis and has instructed barristers Adam Wagner and Cian Murphy of Doughty Street Chambers to challenge the regulations. Taylor Burgess, a senior associate at PGMBM, said: This policy has been ill thought out and has caused a tremendous amount of stress for people. There has been little to no consideration of how this cost will impact people on low incomes. The World Health Organisation’s international health regulations 2005 clearly prohibit charges for quarantine. Our clients believe it is unlawful for the government to operate a policy of charging the same fee of £1,750 to all people who wish to return to England regardless of their individual financial circumstances. One of the people involved in the case, (“Mr M”), is an NHS worker who travelled to Ethiopia in early March to visit his dying uncle and to care for his unwell mother. Shortly after his departure, Ethiopia was added to the “red-list”. He is unable to return to his home and essential role as a key worker as he cannot afford to pay £1,750 to be quarantined. “Mrs B” is a pensioner who travelled to South Africa in October last year to attend her son’s wedding. She was due to arrive home prior to the hotel quarantine regulations coming into force but, after her flight was cancelled, she arrived on 15 February - the day the regulations came into force. Despite receiving a modest pension, Mrs B was asked to pay £1,750 for a hotel quarantine package. The third claimant, (“Mr E”), is a gig economy worker. In early April, Mr E travelled to Pakistan to visit his severely unwell father, who died shortly after Mr E’s arrival. Mr E earns minimum wage and works under a zero-hours contract. To return to England, Mr E was forced to use his family’s emergency savings to pay the upfront fee of £1,750 for his quarantine package. The UK is facing a “quite perilous moment” as the Delta coronavirus variant, first identified in India, takes over, accounting for three-quarters of cases, with no indication yet if the 21 June lifting of restrictions in England will be put on hold. The government’s former chief scientific adviser, Prof Sir Mark Walport, said it was “not impossible” that the country was in the foothills of new wave. “I hope not, but it’s not impossible,” Walport told BBC Breakfast. While the B.1.1.7 variant, or “UK variant”, was disappearing, the B.1.617.2 variant, or India variant, was taking over, he said. The World Health Organization has renamed B.1.1.7 as the Alpha variant, and B.1.617.2 as the Delta variant. Walport said: “It is a quite perilous moment, but we’ve just got to keep our fingers crossed that the measures work.” He added: “It’s clear that the B.1.617.2 variant is taking over – it accounts for about 75% of those cases which have been typed – the numbers of infections are getting up, but we would expect that. “On the much better news side is the fact that hospital admissions are not surging. If anything, overall they’re coming down, though in some parts of the country where the B.1.617 is at its worst they are increasing slightly, so it is genuinely very, very finely balanced.” More data was needed before a final decision could be made about the 21 June easing of restrictions, he said. “We need to substitute speculation for scientific data that’s the truth of the matter, as everyone has said in the last few days, the situation is very delicately balanced with some three sets of moving parts. Read the full story here: An expert advising the Government’s coronavirus response warned that having to reimpose lockdown restrictions would be both worse economically and for public health. Discussing his warning over the June 21 unlocking, Professor Adam Finn, from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: There are a lot of people who are very fed up about the idea of us even worrying about this. Since I’ve been saying in the last 24 hours that we should be cautious I’ve been getting lots of messages from people telling me to shut up basically. But the truth is that a more infectious virus, which is what it looks like we’ve got, will reach people who are vulnerable - those who did not make a good response to the vaccine, those who have not yet had their doses - and that will be a problem for everyone because in the end it will be worse economically as well as for public health if we end up having to shut down again. Asked about whether final restrictions should be eased on June 21, Finn told LBC radio: “I fear it may be a bad decision to go with it.” Asked about the businesses which may not survive further delay, he added: I think they are more likely not to survive if we open up and then shut down again. I’m no business person, and shouldn’t really be commenting on business, but it seems to me that if we can progressively get back to a place where we’re living normally that would be the better thing. But he added that the final decision to unlock lies with politicians, adding: Scientists advise but they don’t decide, and ultimately the politicians have to carry the can for whatever decisions are made. The job of the Covid-19 vaccination programme is not yet “done”, an immunisation expert has said as scientists are split on whether the government should press ahead with the final stages of easing social restrictions later this month. Professor Adam Finn, of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), said there are still many people who are vulnerable to the effects of Covid-19 as he warned “the idea that somehow the job is done is wrong”. Experts are divided over whether the final stage of easing social restrictions should press ahead on June 21 amid a surge in cases of the new variant first identified in India. Finn, from the University of Bristol, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: There’s vulnerability across the country. The idea that somehow the job is done is wrong. We’ve still got a lot of people out there who’ve neither had this virus ... nor yet been immunised, and that’s why we’re in a vulnerable position right now. He told LBC that pressing ahead with the easing of restrictions on June 21 “may be a bad decision”. Professor Ravi Gupta, a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), said a delay of a few weeks could have a significant impact on Britain’s battle against the pandemic and recommended it should be made clear to the public that it would be a temporary measure based on the surge in cases of the new variant. “Even a month delay could have a big impact on the eventual outcome of this,” Gupta told ITV’s Good Morning Britain. However, Robert Dingwall, professor of sociology at Nottingham Trent University, said it was important to press ahead with the June 21 easing from a societal point of view. He told Times Radio: I personally don’t see any case for delay ... from a societal point of view, I think it’s really important that we go ahead on June 21 and I’ve not really seen anything in the data that would lead me to doubt that as a proposition on the evidence to date. I think we need to recognise the way in which levels of fear and anxiety in the population have been amplified over the last 15 months or so. Domino’s Pizza is aiming to hire 5,000 chefs and delivery drivers, as consumers’ appetite for takeaways remains strong, at a time when the hospitality industry is battling staff shortages. Britain’s biggest pizza delivery chain said it had recruited just over 8,000 people in 2020 to meet demand, including hairdressers, taxi drivers and event managers who were not able to work as usual during lockdown. However, as Covid restrictions ease, some of Domino’s pandemic recruits are returning to their previous roles. As a result, the chain needs more staff for its 1,100 UK branches, most of which are run by franchisees. The firm has previously announced plans to open a further 200 outlets. Domino’s search for new employees comes amid warnings from the hospitality industry that it is facing a staffing crisis, with businesses trying to fill thousands of vacancies. Read the full story here: A scientific adviser to the government has repeated calls to delay the June 21 lifting of pandemic restrictions by “a few weeks”, warning that the ability of coronavirus to adapt in the face of vaccines has still left the UK in a vulnerable position. Professor Ravi Gupta, a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), said the UK’s pandemic picture had changed since its road map to recovery was drawn up, chiefly through the emergence of the Indian of B1617.2 strain of the virus, PA news reports. He also warned the increased socialisation following last month’s easing of restrictions could lead to “quite a lot” of hospital admissions, and said while Britain had performed “amazingly well” in its vaccination programme, it was still too early “to put the vaccine straight up against the virus”. Prof Gupta told ITV’s Good Morning Britain moving back the June 21 target date could have a significant impact on the fight against the pandemic, adding it should be made clear to the public this would be a temporary measure based on recent developments. More than 39 million people have been given a first jab and a further 25.3 million have had both doses. Asked whether a three-week delay to the June 21 target would be sufficient while Britons were being vaccinated at a rate of four million per week, he said: Even a month delay could have a big impact on the eventual outcome of this. As long as it’s clear to people this is not an unlimited extension of the lockdown but actually just a reassessment, that would be realistic. Because we didn’t plan for the 617.2 variant when the initial road map was made, and actually things have gone really well except for the fact that we have this new variant to complicate things. We must remember this is a virus that does adapt, and faced with vaccines it will eventually start to make mutations to avoid them even further, and then we could be in an even more precarious situation after that. Gupta said the UK was in “a really good position” in regard to its vaccination programme but caution remained crucial. He said: The key thing here is that we’re almost there. The problem is we don’t want to put the vaccine straight up against the virus at a time when the vaccine coverage isn’t quite high enough; it’s not in young people, it’s not in schoolchildren, and that’s where the virus may potentially start circulating. We still have a lot of vulnerable people in the community who haven’t responded to the vaccine. Gupta said it was concerning that hospital admissions could be about to rise following last month’s easing of restrictions, at a time when hospitals were dealing with large backlogs of procedures and treatments delayed because of the pandemic. He said: If we’re fully unlocked on the 21st of June, we have a situation where over the next few weeks there will be a lot of mixing, there will be gatherings, because people have been waiting to do these things for a long time. So we will get an excess of mixing, especially in younger groups, and that will lead to some hospitalisations... quite a lot, at a time when the NHS is trying to distance within hospitals, so it does take time to get things done there, and the added pressure of having Covid cases, some of which will be severe of course, is going to have an effect on morale and clinical care for everybody. Robert Dingwall, professor of sociology at Nottingham Trent University, said “critics” who have suggested that the June 21 easing should be delayed “can’t even agree on what delay they’d like”. He told Times Radio: By the time we get to June 21, everybody who is in the nine priority groups or the highest risk will have had both jabs, and would have had a period of time to consolidate the immunity. What are we going on with is really running into younger age groups who are intrinsically much lower risk. Many of the scientists who’ve been talking over the weekend simply haven’t adjusted their expectations to understand that - (for these people) Covid is a mild illness in the community. As the Director of Public Health Bolton was saying last week, the people who are going into hospital... it’s not like January, these are not desperately ill people. They’re people who need a little bit of extra support with oxygen, they need access to the dexamethasone treatment, which is very effective. They go in, stay in hospital for three or four days and they go out again. There is no realistic prospect of the NHS facing the sorts of pressures that it faced in January and February. And that’s why I think we have to we have to push on with this. Heathrow has begun processing arrivals from red list countries in a dedicated terminal following concerns about them mixing with other passengers. Travellers arriving from red list nations on direct flights are being taken to Terminal 3. Passengers travelling to the UK on connecting flights from red list locations continue to transit through the airport alongside those from green and amber countries. The red list currently consists of 43 nations from which arrivals are deemed to present a high risk of importing coronavirus. Passengers arriving in the UK after being in one of those destinations during the previous 10 days must spend 11 nights in a quarantine hotel, costing 1,750 for solo travellers. Red list countries from where direct flights to the UK are permitted include India, the Philippines, Pakistan, Kenya and Bangladesh. The decision to separate arrivals on direct flights from red list destinations was welcomed by the GMB union, which had previously warned that “bottlenecks” are putting passengers and staff at risk. Heathrow insisted there were “several layers of protection to keep passengers and colleagues safe”, such as mandatory testing for all arrivals, segregation and ventilation. An airport executive said in April that passengers are being forced to queue for up to six hours to be processed through immigration halls. It is the first time Terminal 3 has been used since April 2020, when it was closed to save costs amid the collapse in demand for travel. Heathrow plans to move its new facility for processing red list arrivals to Terminal 4 “as soon as operationally possible”. Meanwhile, Robert Boyle, former director of strategy at British Airways’ parent company IAG, has predicted that Bahrain, Costa Rica, Trinidad and Tobago, and Kuwait will be added to the red list “shortly” due to rising infection rates. He wrote in a blog post: Given how much heat the government is taking about the delays in adding India to the red list, you might wonder why the four red list candidates haven’t already been added. But ministers are also under heavy pressure to open up travel, not only from beleaguered airlines and other travel companies, but also from parts of the media chafing against what many see as unjustified state restrictions on liberty. Robert Dingwall, professor of sociology at Nottingham Trent University, said that it was important to press ahead with the June 21 easing from a societal point of view. He told Times Radio: I personally, I don’t see any case for delay... from a societal point of view, I think it’s really important that we go ahead on June 21, and I’ve not really seen anything in the data that would lead me to doubt that as a proposition on the evidence to date. I think we need to recognise the way in which levels of fear and anxiety in the population have been amplified over the last 15 months or so. We’ve got to look at the collateral damage in terms of untreated cancers, untreated heart conditions, all of the other things that people suffer from. We’ve got to think about the impact of economic damage that would be caused by further periods of delay and uncertainty. What we see at the moment I think is really a preview of what it means to live with Covid as an endemic infection – these waves will come, they will pass through; there will be high levels of mild infections in the community for periods of time, a handful of people may be seriously ill, even fewer may die. But that’s what happens with respiratory viruses, and we’ve lived with 30-odd respiratory viruses for since forever. Former chief scientific adviser to the government, Professor Sir Mark Walport, said the UK was in a “perilous moment” and potentially on the cusp of a third wave but that more data was needed before the final decision could be made about the June 21 easing of restrictions. He told BBC Breakfast: We need to substitute speculation for scientific data that’s the truth of the matter, as everyone has said in the last few days, the situation is very delicately balanced with some three sets of moving parts. Firstly we have got a new more transmissible variant, of that there is no doubt, though we don’t know exactly how much more transmissible. Secondly, there’s been a change in behaviour following the relaxation of measures on May 17, and the effects of that will just be starting to come through. And thirdly, we’ve got a vaccination programme that is very successful, but with a lot of people that still need both their second dose of vaccine and vaccination from scratch. I’m afraid that weeks before the Prime Minister has to make the difficult decision it is going to be necessary to bring in the data. Asked if the nation is “in the foothills of another wave”, Walport told said he hoped not but that “it’s not impossible”. He said: That’s the reality of it - we have got a new variant and it is taking off, where the B.1.1.7 variant was disappearing. It is a quite perilous moment, but we’ve just got to keep our fingers crossed that the measures work. He added it was clear that the B.1.617.2 variant (also known as the India variant) is “taking over “. He said: It accounts for about 75% of those cases which have been typed - the numbers of infections are getting up, but we would expect that. On the much better news side is the fact that hospital admissions are not surging. If anything, overall they’re coming down, though in some parts of the country where the B.1.617 is at its worst they are increasing slightly, so it is genuinely very, very finely balanced.

After a historic show of force from Texas Democrats, in which they walked out of the state capitol before the midnight deadline for a bill described as “Jim Crow 2.0” by the left, Republicans are already plotting their next move to resurrect their fight for sweeping voting restrictions. The Texas governor, Greg Abbott, who says “election integrity” remains an emergency in the state, has announced he will include the issue on his agenda when he reconvenes the legislature for a rapid-fire special session. In Texas, governors wield control to call special sessions that are essentially legislative overtime, though it is unclear when this particular session will begin. This bill sought to ban 24-hour and drive-through voting, restrict the use of drop boxes, lower the bar for overturning an election and make it a state jail felony for a public official to proactively solicit or send vote-by-mail applications. Abbott’s announcement comes as Texas establishes itself as the Republican resistance to the Biden administration. And nationwide, conservative activists continue to push for a review of the 2020 election, an effort experts say is dangerous to democracy. Wounds from Tulsa race massacre still open, one century later On 31 May 1921, a horde of white Tulsans destroyed an area of the city known as Black Wall Street in one of the most grotesque acts of white supremacist terrorism in US history. A hundred years later, Tulsa remains “one of the most segregated and discriminatory” cities in the US, according to its residents. “Our family history is the one thing that was not stolen from us”: descendants of the Tulsa massacre reflect on the “incalculable” loss and trauma. How much has changed in a century? “The long-hoped-for racial reckoning still awaits a country seemingly unwilling to acknowledge in its historical memory the most terrible, deliberately obscured sins in its past and their impact today,” writes Jimmie Briggs. “I call on the American people to reflect on the deep roots of racial terror in our nation,” Joe Biden said in a statement about the Tulsa massacre. He said as well that the federal government must “reckon and acknowledge” the role it had played in “in stripping wealth and opportunity from black communities”. Naomi Osaka withdraws from French Open over press conferences After her decision not to speak to the press during the tournament, Naomi Osaka announced her withdrawal from Roland Garros one day after she was fined $15,000 by the French Open for the decision. Osaka cited her mental health as the reason for not wanting to participate in press conferences. The columnist Jonathan Liew asks what Osaka’s decision says about the media rather than about her. In other news … Covid-19 strains to be given Greek alphabet names to avoid stigma, with the four variants known to the public as the UK/Kent (B.1.1.7), South Africa (B.1.351), Brazil (P.1) and India (B.1.617.2) variants, to now be known Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta, respectively, according to the World Health Organization. The discovery of a mass grave of more than 200 indigenous children at a former school site in Canada has spurred calls for a nationwide search for more mass graves like it. Four more members of the Oath Keepers, a far-right militia group, have been indicted in the 6 January Capitol riot attack. Stat of the day: 39% of American households own guns Today’s stat comes as gun sales continue to increase across the country, with first-time buyers making up more than a fifth of Americans who have bought guns.

As she grapples with the fear of what her peers might think of her passion for the environment and her determination to have her voice heard, we gain an intimate and intergenerational perspective of what it really means to move a family off grid.</p> \n<p>The film was made with the support of the BFI Doc Society Fund and the Climate Story Labs. The filmmakers, Joya Berrow and Lucy Jane, set out with the clear objective of making the entire production carbon conscious.

Joya grew up in Dorset around the small-scale farmers and campaigners Mary &amp; Jyoti Fernandes, who had lived and brought their families up in Tinkers Bubble before moving to Dorset. It has always been a place on Joya’s radar growing up.</p> \n<p>One spring day when we went to visit with Mary, the community members were busy with their daily lives and working the land. We instantly gelled with Eve, who took us under her wing and showed us around. She was particularly excited about her favourite parts of the forest - the curly tree which she climbed, the death swing and the inner forest trampoline.</p> \n<p>It was inspiring to see her positive interactions with nature and the intergenerational community around her. Living in the forest had helped bring out a deep appreciation of the environment in Eve, and we instantly recognised how special that was. After that day, we knew that we wanted to collaborate with her to tell her story, so we set about organising further visits. On those subsequent trips we really got to know her family though helping with daily activities such as planting and harvesting vegetables.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eb7927e860fc35f3e6e0f407d22caf135332ec47\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb7927e860fc35f3e6e0f407d22caf135332ec47/0_730_1358_814/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eve and film-maker Lucy on the inner forest trampoline\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eve and film-maker Lucy on the inner forest trampoline.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Photo by crew/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>We have always felt passionately about shining a light on alternative living and really admired the commitment of the community at Tinkers Bubble to sustainable living, activism and dedication to the climate movement.</p> \n<h2><strong>What compelled you to tell their story?</strong></h2> \n<p>We met Eve and her family at such a pivotal point in their lives, having only moved to the community a few months prior.

We were inspired by their commitment to the climate movement but the emotional and practical trials and tribulations of actually moving off grid provided an honest and human narrative to the story. We knew the film would challenge an often stereotypical or misunderstood representation of alternative living, and saw how Eve and her family had the power to encourage viewers to connect with nature and consider more sustainable daily choices.

They are the future stewards of this planet and their opinions are so important.

We knew we wanted to use his music before we had even shot the film, and it became a guiding energy throughout the filming process.

We learned all about how a sustainable approach can be taken by mitigating the impact of production from the seed of the idea, as opposed to at the end when the damage has already been done.

As she grapples with the fear of what her peers might think of her passion for the environment and her determination to have her voice heard, we gain an intimate and intergenerational perspective of what it really means to move a family off grid. The film was made with the support of the BFI Doc Society Fund and the Climate Story Labs. The filmmakers, Joya Berrow and Lucy Jane, set out with the clear objective of making the entire production carbon conscious. The Tinkers Bubble community is committed to living fossil-fuel free and has been beyond carbon neutral for 25 years. We find out more about its approach to sustainable filmmaking and the lessons learned along the way. How did you first meet Eve and her family? A wonderful series of events led us to Tinkers Bubble and meeting the Tizard family. Joya grew up in Dorset around the small-scale farmers and campaigners Mary &amp; Jyoti Fernandes, who had lived and brought their families up in Tinkers Bubble before moving to Dorset. It has always been a place on Joya’s radar growing up. One spring day when we went to visit with Mary, the community members were busy with their daily lives and working the land. We instantly gelled with Eve, who took us under her wing and showed us around. She was particularly excited about her favourite parts of the forest - the curly tree which she climbed, the death swing and the inner forest trampoline. It was inspiring to see her positive interactions with nature and the intergenerational community around her. Living in the forest had helped bring out a deep appreciation of the environment in Eve, and we instantly recognised how special that was. After that day, we knew that we wanted to collaborate with her to tell her story, so we set about organising further visits. On those subsequent trips we really got to know her family though helping with daily activities such as planting and harvesting vegetables. We have always felt passionately about shining a light on alternative living and really admired the commitment of the community at Tinkers Bubble to sustainable living, activism and dedication to the climate movement. What compelled you to tell their story? We met Eve and her family at such a pivotal point in their lives, having only moved to the community a few months prior. They were still adjusting to their new, more slowly paced way of living and were ironing out challenges of living in a community. It seemed like a strong time of reflection for them, particularly for Eve’s parents, Kirsty and Nick, so it felt like a valuable time to capture and share. We realised that the family’s story was relatable on many levels, and for many types of viewer, young or old.

girls thought missing from Victoria have sparked a Covid scare after hitchhiking to South Australia overnight. SA Police confirmed the two girls had come to visit a friend in Goolwa, and hitchhiked with different vehicles to get to the state. All three girls caught a school bus to Victor Harbor High School this morning, where Police stopped them before anyone could get off. The girls are now in isolation, with arrangements being made for them to be tested. Good afternoon everyone, and a quick thanks to Matilda and Elias for expertly guiding us through the morning’s news. I’ll be here for the afternoon’s headlines, and there’s much to get through, so let’s jump in. With that, I shall pass you over to the amazing Mostafa Rachwani to take you through the rest of the day. Did I hear you asking for former Labor leader and frontbencher Bill Shorten’s views on the lockdown? Oh, well, here they are anyway: Some people say we should not talk about blame and ... I can understand that, but as a Melburnian I cannot help but wonder that if the Morrison government had an app that works, if they had a public health campaign encouraging people to get vaccinated, if they had built some federal quarantine facilities that were built for purpose, and if they had rolled out their vaccines quicker, then maybe there’s a chance all of this trauma could have been avoided. OK. Here is what we learnt. Just four new Covid-19 cases from more than 50,000 tests. All are linked to the current cluster There will be an announcement from the state government in the coming days on economic support for businesses Victoria has asked the commonwealth for 160 ADF staff to help with lockdown measures such as doorknocking One of the cluster early cases may have been out in the community while infectious for 12 days from 13 May There are five locations of particular concern for authorities where they believe transmission may have occurred in popular pubs and bars. These locations are: The Sporting Globe, Mordiallioc, 23 May, 6.15pm-9.45pm 3 Monkeys, Prahran, 22 May, 9.10pm-11pm Somewhere Bar, Prahran, 22 May Palace Hotel Sth Melb, 23 May, 5.45-6.45pm The Local, Port Melbourne, 21 May, 1.30-3.30pm They believe hundreds of people will have been at these bars and clubs during these times, but have only got QR code check-in records “in the tens”. Anyone who has been to these locations must come forward and contact the health department. NSW Labor leader Jodi McKay is expected to announce she is standing down at a press conference which should take place shortly. It is understood head office has intervened and demanded a resolution to the instability that has followed the Upper Hunter byelection result. It is unclear whether there will be a contest for the leadership. Transport spokesman Chris Minns and the former leader Michael Daley have expressed interest in the past. McKay has been leading the opposition since March 2019. She won the leadership under the new Labor rules which give the rank and file a vote as well as caucus. The next state election in NSW is not due until March 2023. And to finish off Sutton has reiterated there is no firm case number threshold for lockdown to be extended or eased early. There is no single figure threshold for how you respond. The considerations, as I think I outlined yesterday, relate to new exposure sites, the number of new cases, but also how many contacts they have, how many places they have been to, and the kind of risk settings and the relative seriousness in those settings that have to be under consideration. Brett Sutton says regional Victoria has been locked down as well, basically because the government was worried city-slickers would flood to any restriction-free areas. The reality is if we carved out a part of regional Victoria and said no restrictions in that place, that’s where everyone from Melbourne would go ... and this virus [could be introduced] into previously unaffected areas. There are operational considerations about how you stop some of the potential movement, if you were to carve out one area or many areas of regional Victoria. That said, these restrictions are under review and reconsideration every single day and if there is an operational response that can manage that and carve out parts or all of regional Victoria or, indeed, parts of metro Melbourne, that will always be under consideration, but what we do not want to do is export this virus to previously unaffected areas. One thing that often happens during lockdowns is a big rise in ambulance call-outs, which can lead to queues of ambulances carrying passengers lining up outside hospitals. This has already begun in Melbourne and Merlino says the state is working on it. Look, this is a significant issue, not just here in Victoria but right across the country. We are seeing, as the minister for health has explained and so have I previously, a significant spike in callouts, 10,000 additional callouts compared to the quarter before. We are seeing a big impact in terms of our ambulance system, our emergency departments, and that’s reflected right across the country. I was at a national cabinet meeting where almost every state and territory said this is a big problem ... We are seeing a significant challenge on ambulances and in our emergency departments in Victoria and right across the nation ... It was agreed that health ministers will come together to agree on what to do, and in the meantime, in the budget we handed down last week, there was $759m of additional support. That will go to triage nurses. That will go to additional paramedics, to try to ease the pressure. I acknowledge this is a challenge and it is a national challenge. We are doing what we can for the state budget, but additional $759m, and it will be discussed at a national level at national cabinet. So, these new cases announced today are all linked to the current outbreak, but how? Testing commander Jeroen Weimar says: The four new positive cases we have identified today, three of them are associated with the Whittlesea outbreak. All are within the primary close contacts of the existing positive cases. One of the cases is a friend, a primary close contact of the positive case associated with the Stratton Finance outbreak ... That fourth case is the one who spent some time in a sporting club with a positive case on Sunday 23 May. Let’s play a game of “which politicians in Victoria have been vaccinated” (because Merlino was just asked). Off the top of my head, I don’t know how many MPs have received the vaccination. I know that Martin Pakula (industry) has; I know Martin Foley (health) has; I know Tim Pallas (treasury) has. I am getting vaccinated today. I think the leader of the opposition is getting vaccinated today. But I don’t know how many have vaccinated. Reporter: Has the premier been vaccinated? Merlino: I am not sure, Rich. I doubt he has been vaccinated because he is just in the category that is eligible today, so I am not sure if he has got a booking for a vaccination, but I will be getting mine straight after this. Chief health officer Brett Sutton says everyone who attended potential exposure sites on Chapel St in the city’s inner-east suburbs has so far tested negative. All negatives back from those who attended, but again, we want to make absolutely sure that we are capturing everyone who has been to those potential sites. Oooh, this is a little juicy. Merlino was asked if he is asking the commonwealth to reinstate jobkeeper and, well, he didn’t say no. I won’t talk for the treasurers – they are having discussions right now. I just want to let people know, particularly the business community know, that the Victorian treasurer and federal treasurer are talking about assistance as well as the work that we’re doing in terms of providing business assistance and a package that we will announce the coming days. Merlino says people can “certainly expect” an announcement on support for business owners in the coming days. He was then asked if he is frustrated by the commonwealth’s refusal to provide similar support. As I’ve said, and I know ... our industry minister was out this morning talking about this. Our immediate focus in terms of the decisions we have had to make have been on public health. Doing what we need to do to keep our community safe and allow the public health team to get ahead of this outbreak. Our focus is now both on dealing with the outbreak as well as thinking about what further support we can give our business community, our event organisers. We know this is difficult. We know it is even more difficult because we are in a period now where jobkeeper is not providing the support, the direct support. Wage subsidies, these are commonwealth matters. So we are discussing between governments, between treasurers about what support the commonwealth can provide. We are doing our work in terms of what assistance we will provide to the business community and we will have something to say in coming days. James Merlino says it’s too early to know if the lockdown is likely to end early or be extended further (Which like, given it’s only day one is not that surprising.) It would be entirely based on the advice of public health and that is how we have operated with other circuit breaker lockdown is over longer periods of lockdown, that would be based on advice from public health in terms of how quickly we can return to the settings that we had prior to the circuit breaker lockdown. Reporter: Can you give any indication to people today about what we are working on at the moment? Is there going to be a staged easing? Merlino: Sure, I cannot today and as Professor Sutton has said we are in the early days of this circuit breaker lot down. Advice from public health is that need the seven days to get ahead of this outbreak and I’m confident that will happen. We are in early days. I mentioned a second ago that the federal government had been fairly firm that it would not provide economic support to Victoria during the lockdown, but it looks like acting premier Merlino is still holding out hope. My response is the respective treasurers, Tim Pallas and Josh Frydenberg, are in active discussions about what support can be provided and I think it is a good thing. The prime minister made some comments that the commonwealth is looking to work hand in glove with the Victorian government and I welcome it. And that can be done in a number of ways. There is the formal request that we will be putting through for additional ADF staff to assist the authorised officers and there are discussions happening between the respective treasurers Tim Pallas and Josh Frydenberg in terms of what support can be provided. Just a bit more of the Victorian vaccination capacity. Cowie: We were saying last week that we had at least double the capacity that we were currently using, we have more than double that already is was referred to previously, so our state system, we are running the numbers now we always wanted to be and we can do a little bit more, we are continuing to invest in more sites and more workforce. Really, important to remember, most vaccines in Victoria are actually being administered by our GPs. So people really do need to remember also those fantastic GPs in Victoria who are vaccinating more people than the state system every day. Cowie: I would like to see eligibility expanded as soon as we have the capacity to do so. And we will continue to review the uptake of vaccination, the number of people booking in and our booking systems are booking people in up to four weeks’ time, so not everyone will be vaccinated today and not everyone will be able to be vaccinated next week, but our health services – and I think there was a question before about the workforce – we are continuing to expand the vaccination workforce. We are continuing to connect offers of assistance to work with our services to expand the workforce to ensure that more and more Victorians will be vaccinated with every passing day. Prof Ben Cowie, the head of the state’s vaccine program, says he can’t put a date on when Pfizer jabs would be opened up to 30- to 39-year-olds. Really, that is a dynamic process. Hundreds of thousands of Victorians have become newly eligible for vaccination today. And we have been so gratified by the response. It’s amazing to see how many people are wanting to be vaccinated. What I would say is that we obviously cannot vaccinate hundreds of thousands of people in a single day and it relates to the questions about people booking in and having difficulties accessing those bookings. I would say if you are one of those tens of thousands of Victorians calling in at any one time, please, if you cannot get through, I’m sorry but if you could possibly call back in the afternoon. We commit to vaccinating every single Victorian who wants to be vaccinated in the coming weeks. Without question. In terms of further age groups becoming eligible, we really need to see what the demand looks like over the next few days and we will obviously ask government to ensure that we are increasing eligibility once a system is able to handle it. I will jump back to Victoria in one second, but just quickly: no local Covid-19 cases in NSW today. Reporter: I know it sounds obvious, but how much of a setback is that? The [person] was presenting symptoms and didn’t go and get tested? Is that one of the reasons we are in this mess? Sutton: We are encouraging absolutely everyone at the first sign or symptom of illness, and it can be very mild, it can be just a tickle in the throat or just a runny nose or just a headache or lethargy. Do not think that it is something else. You have to work on the assumption that it is Covid. Get that negative test, and then assure yourself you are not putting others at risk. We can’t emphasise it enough. It is out there in the community, you have to assume it is Covid until proven otherwise. Reporter: Was this person a bit of a sceptic on Covid? Sutton: No. Look, there are so many reasons that people say: ‘Am I really at risk? Other people might be at risk but not me. I don’t work out the airport, I don’t work in hotel quarantine, you know, I haven’t been around high-risk settings.’ And yet here we are. So you always have to think about the possibility that it could be you, as an average citizen. That is the key. Some of the dates on exposure sites are now stretching back as far as 13 and 14 May, two days earlier than previously thought. A reporter has asked chief health officer Prof Brett Sutton about this. It looks like one of the first cases was actually symptomatic for longer than we previously knew. We have revised his timeline, based again, as we do with so many of our cases, reinterviewing, going back to his personal diary and recollections and the likelihood he might have had mild symptoms a couple of days earlier. Reporter: So he didn’t get tested until the 25th. That means he was out in the community for 12 days before he got tested? Sutton: Potentially, yes. Weimar was asked if venues that failed to make everyone check-in via the QR code system will be found. He didn’t answer directly but didn’t seem that jazzed about the idea. At this point in time, our focus is on finding out who was there. If we are seeing significant breaches, we do have enforcement activity underway, we have had it underway for a number of months, and we will enforce that where necessary. But my message today is, this is about making sure people are safe. As we sit here today we have 30 people currently awkward COVID-19 in the state, around this community outbreak. We are really keen to ensure that they are safe, but they are being looked after and getting the care they need. We want to minimise any additional cases There have been reports of extremely long wait times for vaccine bookings in Victoria. Weimar is asked if any doses will go to waste because people are unable to make a booking. He says: “No.” One of the very positive things we are seeing now over the last few days, we are seeing an increasing interest in vaccination, and we’re grateful to all Victorians ... The million doses we have now been able to administer, and more as we go forward, both GPs and vaccination clinics are really focused on ensuring that there is no wastage. The more people that book, the more people that come forward, the less wastage we will see ... A couple of days ago we had 350 people working on vaccination bookings and today we have over 550 working on vaccination bookings [and] we have 150 people dealing with other Covid-related questions ... We have another couple hundred people coming online in the next few days, Weimar is being questioned about Victoria’s QR code scanning system. He says although more people were at the venues than necessarily checked in the affected venues had still been doing a good job of record keeping. What we’re seeing this particular outbreak as examples of really good record-keeping, and I’m so grateful to businesses and individuals for participating in that. But we have a number of locations where we just don’t think we have captured all the people who were in those venues. It is important to get hold of them now... We have seen over the last couple of months across Australia... lower levels of compliance with QR code systems in a number of other states, as we have seen in Victoria. We had talked about this and said it is something that we as the community need to deal with it, moving it onto a single platform makes it even easier to comply. Again, I am grateful to everybody, particularly in the business community, for the work they have done to get us on track. Weimar: The five sites I went through are a particular concern to us because essentially they are clubs, social contacts, places where we expect to see significant numbers of people in close proximity, dancing, singing, doing what they do. In one of those locations we have now had one case of confirmed community transmission. Obviously what we are keen to do is exclude as quickly as we can is whether there has been any other community transmission of those other venues. Testing commander (yes, real title) Jeroen Weimar says there are a number of new exposure sites from the four new cases overnight. As the acting premier said we have a total of 30 positive cases across those two outbreaks. One person of course is linked. Between those two outbreaks we have 121 public exposure venues. I appreciate the number of exposure sites continues to increase as we do more and more interviews and as we identify new, additional cases. The four cases identified in the last 24 hours are of course feeding additional sites ... So we have an individual who was at the Sporting Globe in Mordialloc between 6.15pm and 9.45pm on Sunday 23 May ... the Three Monkeys in Prahran, 9pm to 11pm ... and again, a bit later. (Those dates and times are of course on our website.) ... Then The Somewhere Bar in Prahran, again on the night of the 22nd; The Palace hotel in Melbourne between 9.45pm and 6.45pm on the 23rd. And The Local in Port Melbourne, again on the 21st, between 1.30pm and 3.30pm. Yesterday the prime minister said the commonwealth would provide ADF assistance to Victoria if needed. Today the locked-down state has taken up the offer. James Merlino: Finally I want to welcome the PM’s comments that the commonwealth will be working hand in glove with Victorian authorities. I want to thank him for that and to that end there is some additional assistance that we require and I’ve contacted the PM this morning. We will be putting a formal request through for additional ADF staff. The request will be for around 160 ADF staff for at least the next fortnight to assist our authorised offices in doorknocking. Doorknocking positive cases, doorknocking primary close contacts. If we have those additional ADF staff pairing up with authorised officers we are effectively doubling our capacity to do that really important work over the next few weeks. So the commonwealth are looking at this and I want to again thank the commonwealth for their efforts in supporting Victoria in any way that we need. The PM also very much shot down any plans for commonwealth financial support for small businesses though, so I’m sure Merlino isn’t THAT thankful this morning. James Merlino says he will get his vaccination today as he is in the newly eligible 40-49 age group. Victoria has now administered 1m vaccine doses. Merlino: We also administered 17,223 vaccine doses. This is exactly the sort of numbers we want to see each and every day. So well over 17,000 vaccine doses. It takes us, in Victoria, to over 1m vaccines administered, both through the state sites and through the GP networks, so my thanks to everybody. That is a great milestone and we have to keep going. James Merlino: There are 39 active cases of coronavirus in Victoria. We recorded four new locally acquired cases yesterday. All of those are linked to the current outbreak which is, again, a good thing. Plus two new cases in hotel quarantine. We also saw some record numbers which I want to thank all Victorians: 47,462 Covid tests were processed yesterday. That is real proof at how seriously Victorians are taking this challenge and how much we have been able to up to the system to cater for the demand. But those testing numbers are outstanding and I want to thank all Victorians Acting Victorian premier James Merlino is speaking now. We’re standing by for the Victorian acting premier and CHO to arrive for today’s update. If you have a spare minute or two this Sunrise clip is worth a watch. During the federal health minister Greg Hunt’s appearance this morning he repeatedly stated that he had never said there was “no rush” to get the vaccine. The only problem is his boss, the prime minister, has repeatedly said the vaccine rollout “isn’t a race”, and Sunrise had the proof ready to go. OK. The alert has just come through. Looks like we should be hearing from the Victorian acting premier James Merlino and the chief health officer Prof Brett Sutton in about half an hour – 10.45am. I shall also be sharing extra bits of *joy* on the blog today for the sake of my fellow Victorian readers. Cryptocurrency traders who think they’re living in a faceless high-tech world will soon get a letter from the tax office, reports Marion Rae from AAP. ATO data has captured a dramatic increase in trading since the beginning of 2020, with more than 600,000 taxpayers dabbling in crypto-assets. They’ll be slugged with penalties and audits if gains are not declared at tax time. Assistant commissioner Tim Loh said: We are alarmed some taxpayers think the anonymity of cryptocurrencies provides a licence to ignore their tax obligations ... While it appears cryptocurrency operates in an anonymous digital world, we closely track where it interacts with the real world through data from banks, financial institutions, and cryptocurrency online exchanges to follow the money back to the taxpayer. The ATO then matches data to tax returns to make sure investors are paying the right tax. The tax office will write to about 100,000 taxpayers with cryptocurrency assets explaining their obligations and urging them to review their previously lodged returns. The ATO also expects to prompt almost 300,000 taxpayers as they lodge their 2021 tax return to report their cryptocurrency capital gains or losses. Businesses or sole traders paid cryptocurrency for goods or services will have these payments taxed as income based on the value of the cryptocurrency in Australian dollars. Tonight’s top-of-the-table AFL clash between Melbourne and the Western Bulldogs will go ahead after all Demons players and staff returned negative Covid test results. An unnamed player attended an exposure site last weekend, putting the fixture at Marvel Stadium into doubt. The player has been isolating and will do so for 14 days, but his teammates have been cleared to take to the field tonight in a match that will be played behind closed doors. Melbourne said in a statement: As of Friday morning, all Melbourne players and football staff have received negative coronavirus test results. Players and staff are now clear to attend the club’s round 11 clash with the Bulldogs. The player who attended a tier one exposure site will continue to undertake his 14-day isolation as per government regulation. Guardian Australia will liveblog tonight’s big game. Start time in Melbourne is 7.50pm. A leading mouse expert has moved to reassure people in Sydney the plague affecting parts of rural New South Wales is not spreading to the city – despite increased sightings recorded on a tracking map. In recent days residents in Cabramatta, St Clair and Revesby in Sydney have reported “medium” mouse activity – some have posted photos of destroyed documents and mouse faeces. The residents were users of an online platform called Mouse Alert which allows people to register rodent infestations. The map displays hundreds of red dots across parts of regional Queensland, NSW and Victoria. Read the full story below: I will be sharing a lot of tweets showing the long vaccine lines today, mostly just because, as a Melburnian, it gives me a fleeting sense of control in the chaos of this world. Just a reminder, if you are unsure about the new Melbourne lockdown rules you can check out the Guardian’s (very good) explainer below: Hello all, Matilda Boseley here, taking you through the next few hours of news. Strap in! With that, I will hand over to my trusted colleague Matilda Boseley, who will take you through the next part of the day. Panic buying offers the illusion of control amid upheaval and acts as a balm for feelings of anxiety and uncertainty. So says Flinders University psychology senior lecturer Dan Fassnacht as Victoria enters its fourth lockdown and toilet paper again flies off the shelves, AAP reports. On Friday Coles and Woolworths imposed a limit of two packs of toilet paper a person in Victoria. “We have plenty of stock in our supply chain, and this temporary measure will help us to manage demand so that we can return our stores to a fully stocked position as quickly as possible,” Coles said. Supermarkets have never closed during the pandemic and the coronavirus, a respiratory illness, does not cause intestinal upset. Fassnacht, an expert in compulsive buying, said this week that panic buying was also excessive and uncontrolled but prompted fewer feelings of shame or regret. The behaviour stemmed from an attempt to regulate anxiety and was linked to the human tendency towards “herd behaviour”. “Often those who have high levels of intolerance of uncertainty are prone to panic buying,” he said. “While excessive or panic buying may lead to short-term feelings of being in control – reducing anxiety or feelings of uncertainty – this usually doesn’t last.” Bill Bowtell AO, adjunct professor at UNSW and a strategic health policy consultant, writes: As they enter the ‘circuit-breaker’ lockdown, Victorians are entitled to be dismayed by the multiple failures in Australian government pandemic policies that have required the use of the blunt but necessary measures to contain this outbreak. By the end of 2020, Australians had done the hard work required to achieve sustained zero local transmission of Covid-19. Victorians had endured a 15-week winter lockdown that eliminated Australia’s most serious and deadly outbreak. Having done so well in the emergency phase of the pandemic response, Australians were entitled to expect that the federal government would rapidly implement policies on quarantine and vaccination critical to securing these magnificent achievements, and to bolster our defences against the virus. These expectations were dashed. The federal government avoided its constitutional responsibilities in relation to quarantine. It compounded matters by grievously mishandling the procurement, supply and distribution of vaccines that are critical to the resumption of fully normal life and travel. These interlinked failures have culminated in the Victorian lockdown. Read more: This from Stephen Duckett, the former secretary of what is now the federal health department. We’ve previously reported that public health and advertising experts have been pleading with the government to offer incentives like lottery tickets and cash to rapidly increase the Covid vaccine uptake, after having waited too long to roll out a hard-hitting awareness campaign. There has not been any movement from the government, but the private sector appears to be considering incentives as they remain desperate for vaccinations to ramp up so the economy and borders can reopen. Qantas is considering offering 1,000 frequent-flyer points to people who get both Covid doses, reports the Australian Financial Review. The airline is also reportedly considering offering flight vouchers and status credit incentives for those vaccinated. Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce has been a vocal opponent of the federal government’s assumption that international borders will widely reopen in the second half of 2022. His airline is still preparing for a resumption of international travel by late December. There are now more exposure sites in Victoria. The new tier one sites are: Tuesday 25 May Anytime Fitness, 63-69 Market Street, South Melbourne, between 6am and 7am Barrymore Medical Centre, 9 Barrymore Rd, Greenvale, between 12.25pm and 1.30pm Body Fit Training Hampton, Shop 4-6/498 Hampton St, Hampton, between 5.21pm and 6.29pm Monday 24 May Pentridge Cinema Coburg, 1 Champ St, 7pm screening of the movie Those Who Wish Me Dead, between 6.45pm and 9.30pm Focus Health &amp; Fitness, 121-123 Hyde Street, Yarraville, between 6.30am and 7.30am Anytime Fitness South Melbourne, 63-69 Market Street, South Melbourne, between 6.15am and 7.15am Body Fit Training Hampton, 4-6/498 Hampton Street, Hampton, between 5.35pm and 6.25pm Sunday 23 May Betty’s Burgers and Concrete Co, Westfield Doncaster, Level 2, between 7.40pm and 9.30pm Bung Pai Thai Massage, 11/1320 Plenty Road, Bundoora, between 4.15pm and 6.15pm Green Man’s Arms, 418 Lygon Sreet, Carlton, between 1.20pm and 2.15pm Chelsea Heights Hotel, Springvale Road and Wells Road, Aspendale Gardens, between 12.10pm and 1.30pm The Coffee Club – Craigieburn, Craigieburn Central, Shop B00 15/350 Craigieburn Rd, Craigieburn, between 10am and 11.30am Network Public Bar, 14/99 Spencer Rd, Docklands, between 3.30pm and 5pm Saturday 22 May Peko Peko Fitzroy, 199 Smith Street, Fitzoy between 6.30pm and 9.30pm Caprice Hair &amp; Beauty, 101 Charles Street, Seddon between 1.15pm and 1.40pm LeNails Cranbourne, Shop 101 Cranbourne Park Shopping Centre, High Street, Cranbourne, between 1.15pm and 2.15pm Moonee Valley Football Club, Ormond Park Function Room/Bar, 2A Pattison Steet, Moonee Valley, between 4m and 6pm Moonee Valley Football Club, Ormond Park (change rooms), 2A Pattison Steet, Moonee Valley, between noon and 4pm Friday 21 May Anytime Fitness South Melbourne, 63-69 Market Street, South Melbourne, between 6.15am and 7.15am Hunky Dory Fish &amp; Chips, 3/181 Bay St, Port Melbourne, between noon and 2pm Thursday 20 May Anytime Fitness South Melbourne, 63-69 Market Street, South Melbourne, between 6.15am and 7.15am Here is our full, updated list of all the exposure sites: Earlier on ABC AM, the federal health minister Greg Hunt was also asked about whether there would be further federal financial help for Victoria. This is the first statewide lockdown since the end of jobkeeper wage subsidies in March. He said: At this stage Victoria is the responsible body and they have said they will be providing additional support – we take them at their word ... All up we’ve provided extraordinary support so far. This is a difficult time – I’ll leave those matters to the treasurer. But it’s the Victorian government who has indicated they will be taking measures. That sounds like a big no, or at least not at this stage. Hunt pointed to additional testing, contact tracing, the Victorian aged care response centre, and the support of the Australian military as evidence the feds are not abandoning Victoria. Privatised job agencies concluded welfare mutual obligations did not “improve the likelihood of employment” for jobseekers in unreleased evidence to a government-commissioned review of the Disability Employment Services (Des) program. On Thursday Guardian Australia revealed a report by Boston Consulting Group had found recent reforms to the $1bn a year scheme had delivered a windfall to privatised job agencies but not improved outcomes for the unemployed. The report shows employment consultants offered a scathing assessment of the mutual obligations system, which sees those on benefits required to meet job search requirements. It says the government might save money if it took responsibility for policing mutual obligations away from employment service providers and handed it to Services Australia, or another third party. This would reverse a government decision to force job agencies to handle compliance in 2018 – which drew significant criticism from welfare groups and industry groups at the time. However, the draft version of the report, also obtained under freedom of information, goes further, revealing employers and job agencies are generally unsatisfied with the regime. Read more: A group of not-for-profit and philanthropy experts have warned a planned crackdown on charities by the Coalition will muzzle the sector, restrict dissent and stifle political advocacy. The federal government is pursuing regulatory change to allow charities to be deregistered in cases where any volunteer commits a summary offence – the most minor of legal breaches. The sector fears the changes are a threat to the right of almost 59,000 registered not-for-profits to engage in political advocacy. The new regulations could, for example, allow a massive charity like the St Vincent de Paul Society or UnitingCare to be stripped of charity status if one of their tens of thousands of volunteers attends a protest and does not move on when directed by police. Read more: A major Australian retail group has been fined $630,000 for multiple breaches of consumer law related to pandemic-related health products, including hand sanitiser with alcohol levels far lower than advertised, the consumer watchdog has announced. Mosaic Brands Limited, an ASX-listed retail conglomerate that counts Katies, Rivers, Noni B and Rockmans among its stable, has admitted to making false or misleading claims pertaining to hand sanitiser and face mask products between March and June 2020. The deputy chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, Delia Rickard, said the ACCC was particularly concerned about the misleading claims because they had been made during a global pandemic. Rickard said a study found “one of the sanitisers tested contained an alcohol content of 17% and another had an alcohol content of 58%, below the percentage advertised on Mosaic Brands’ websites in each case. This was also below the minimum 60% alcohol concentration recommended by Australian health authorities.” Read more: The health minister, Greg Hunt, has been interviewed on ABC radio about the Victorian outbreak. He avoided saying whether the federal government is partly responsible for the lockdown, preferring formulations about how it’s responsible for saving lives and filibustering by repeatedly referring to international Covid-19 infection numbers. Eventually he accepted that health was a joint responsibility. Asked about aged care centres, Hunt provided updated figures that 98% of aged care centres have had at least their first dose, including 99% in Victoria and 100% in Whittlesea, which is at the centre of the Victorian outbreak. But the story is much less rosy in disability care where 20,000 people have not had their first dose. Hunt said 6,000 had received 9,000 doses out of a total disability care population of 26,000. He said the government had prioritised aged care over disability care, a fact revealed at the Covid committee in April, which came as a surprise given residents of both are in category 1a. The federal government was likely to support a new quarantine facility in Victoria but it would take months to construct. Asked if ATAGI will review its advice about AstraZeneca not being recommended for under-50s given the Victorian outbreak, he said these decisions were constantly under review and if ATAGI’s advice changes the government would adopt it. I mentioned earlier that Sally Capp, the lord mayor of Melbourne, is calling for further financial assistance for businesses affected by the latest lockdown. Capp told ABC TV: We have to be worried about how people can keep bouncing back from these lockdowns. It’s so difficult. It takes an enormous amount of effort and in this environment there is no jobkeeper, rental assistance programs have finished and we really need to consider the support financially that business owners are going to need, and we know that this is taking a big emotional and mental toll on people across Melbourne and Victoria. We absolutely have to find positive ways of using this lockdown to dedicate resources to urgent, immediate responses that will make a difference as we go forward. We do need confidence and certainty from the state government and federal governments about assistance for those who need it. Financial assistance for business owners that have managed to hang in there this long and who are going to be devastated by this lockdown in Victoria. We know that lockdowns have lags as well. A warm welcome especially to readers in Victoria who have woken to the first day of a seven-day lockdown to contain the Covid outbreak. You can read all about the lockdown restrictions here and a list of exposure sites here. Already this morning, Melbourne lord mayor Sally Capp has been on ABC TV calling for financial support for businesses affected by the lockdown – I’ll post a summary of her interview shortly. Yesterday Victoria’s vaccine hotline crashed for hours, overwhelmed with calls after the state government’s decision to open up vaccinations to those aged over 40 (announced with the lockdown). Meanwhile, last night federal health minister Greg Hunt revealed there were 74 aged care homes across the country yet to receive their first dose of Covid vaccine, 16 in Victoria. He also revealed that just 500,000 Australians have been fully vaccinated with both doses. Yesterday Hunt announced the two-week interval recommended between flu and Covid shots would be scrapped for aged care residents in these homes, given the benefit of vaccinating them in light of the outbreak. Earlier yesterday families of residents at an unvaccinated Melbourne aged care home were “flabbergasted” by comments from aged care minister Richard Colbeck, who had just claimed that those not yet vaccinated had “chosen not to take the jab”. Elsewhere, Australia’s job agency providers are generally dissatisfied with the welfare mutual obligations scheme, a draft review says, concluding it did not “improve the likelihood of employment”. A leading mouse expert is reassuring city slickers (ie, people in Sydney) that the plague affecting parts of rural NSW is not spreading to the city – despite increased sightings recorded on a tracking map. Internationally, the Biden White House’s decision to look into whether coronavirus could have escaped from a laboratory in Wuhan has opened a new divide in already tense US-China relations.

We ask that Australia stops exporting theirs,” she said. But in the year since, Australia’s policy has continued unabated. Planeloads of deportees have continued to arrive, and in March, Australia deported a 15-year-old under the policy. New Zealand’s foreign minister Nanaia Mahuta told the Guardian in an interview last week that the policy was “a sore point” and “point of friction” between the two nations. “We’ve continued to raise our concerns with the 501 deportation policy, the stripping of citizenship,” she said. “When New Zealanders move to Australia and they spend the greater part of their lives in Australia and they identify with Australian culture and their centre of gravity in terms of whānau [family] is in Australia – effectively, they are Australians.” “It will continue to be an ongoing point of discussion,” she said. “That doesn’t stop the overall relationship, the opportunity for New Zealand to find other issues that we can work with Australia on.

Mahuta said at the time that Dutton’s remarks “only serve to trash his own reputation”.

Australia has recently cancelled belt and road initiatives signed with Beijing and the diplomatic rift between the two countries has long since widened into a trade war, with China imposing declared and undeclared sanctions on Australia that cost the country an estimated $47.7bn last year. While New Zealand has joined Australia on some key policy statements including on Uyghur abuses in Xinjiang, and electoral changes in Hong Kong, it is perceived to be taking a more accommodating approach. During a visit to Wellington last month, Australia’s foreign minister, Marise Payne, did not respond directly to a question about whether the Australian government wanted New Zealand to take a stronger line against China. But Payne said it was important to “acknowledge that China’s outlook and the nature of China’s external engagement, both in our region and globally, has changed in recent years”. “An enduring partnership [with New Zealand] requires us to adapt to those new realities, to talk with each other,” Payne said. “And what we have offered is clarity, and consistency and confidence.” Asked about Australia’s approach to China, Mahuta told the Guardian she did not “want to be drawn into commenting on the approach of another country in its bilateral relationship”. But she acknowledged that New Zealand’s approach to China had implications for its Pacific partners. “What I do know is that New Zealand considers itself of the Pacific … and often we’re seen as the doorway to the Pacific – so the way in which we manage many of our relationships becomes quite important,” she said. “The relationship with China has moved beyond the relationship of firsts – we were the first to achieve a free trade agreement with China – to a maturing relationship and a relationship where we can be respectful, consistent and predictable on the issues that are important to us, but also on the issues that separate and differentiate our view of the world from China,” she said. “We’ve really reoriented and repositioned into that space because of the maturing nature of our relationship.” A ‘strategy for reconnection’ On some issues, though, the countries are still very closely aligned, including their elimination approach to Covid-19. If a quarantine-free travel bubble stays in operation between the two countries, their eventual reopening of borders to the rest of the world will also be intertwined. When announcing the New Zealand trip, Morrison said that “both Australia and New Zealand have been world leaders in our response to the Covid-19 pandemic, and this visit is a great illustration of the trans-Tasman safe travel zone in action.” “Australia and New Zealand are family and we share deep historical bonds of friendship, trust and the Anzac spirit,” he said. When the visit was announced earlier in the month, Ardern said it would be “a chance for us to talk about what’s next for our relationship.” “As New Zealand is looking outward to map out our plan and strategy for reconnection, our borders are quite closely linked, so I’d like to have a conversation around what our region’s reconnection with the world will look like.” Morrison will be hosted in Queenstown, one of tourist towns hardest hit by border closures. The visit has also been seen as an opportunity for New Zealand to promote local tourism to an Australian audience – a prospect that may be dampened somewhat by the week-long pause in quarantine-free travel from Victoria, a suspension that may yet delay the trip. The New Zealand government has asked all those who have travelled from the greater Melbourne area to New Zealand since 20 May to self-isolate immediately and get tested. The order may affect Morrison, who was in Victoria on 20 May. A New Zealand government spokesperson said that “with regard to the upcoming visit of prime minister Morrison, we are in close contact with the Australian government and working through any implications for the visit”. It is understood that the health orders will apply to the delegation in the same way as any other traveller – but should pre-departure testing be in place, it would resolve the requirement for Morrison to isolate.

Other states have also imposed snap lockdowns or restrictions as a result of Covid cases in the community, most recently New South Wales, after a mystery case. But, with the exception of Sydney’s northern beaches cluster, most leaks from hotel quarantine have not resulted in sizeable outbreaks. So has Victoria just been unlucky, or are there other factors that affect how Covid-19 is transmitted in the state? Is community spread down to bad luck? James McCaw, a professor of mathematical biology at the University of Melbourne, says chance is a dominant factor, because there is a huge amount of variability in how many people an individual infected with Covid-19 spreads the virus to. In the early stages of an outbreak, the virus has a distinct pattern of spread known as clustered transmission, which is highly unpredictable. An estimated 70% of infected individuals do not pass the virus on to anybody else, and research has shown that around 20% of people – so-called “super-spreaders” – are responsible for the vast majority of viral transmission. The pattern of spread was similar for Sars, and differs from other viruses such as those that cause the flu, which are transmitted more consistently. “In terms of control, that works in our favour,” McCaw says. When a leak in hotel quarantine infection controls occurs, by far the most likely outcome is that Covid-19 spreads to nobody or to only one person, he says. “Often, someone gets it, they get through the [infection control] system, but they don’t pass it on to anyone and we avoid an outbreak. “We saw that in Western Australia and we’ve seen it many other times where an infected person is in the community.” Hassan Vally, an associate professor in epidemiology at Latrobe University, agrees Victoria’s latest lockdown is the unlucky result of someone shedding high amounts of virus after quarantining in South Australia. “Any other state could face this similar situation,” Vally says. “We’ve got to be careful that we don’t blame Victoria for this.” Does Covid spread faster in cold weather?

The bill was intended to set up a 9/11-style commission that would examine its causes and impact and exactly who was involved. Donald Trump is still powerful in the Republican party and has reacted angrily to the idea of such a commission. Observers believe that many top Republicans are fearful of antagonizing Trump and his loyal followers and also worried about what such a commission might uncover, including potential links between Republican lawmakers and some of those who invaded the building. The Thursday vote would mark the first successful use of a filibuster in the Biden presidency to halt Senate legislative action, and is likely to boost pressure on the president to get rid of the Senate tradition that requires a vote by 60 of the 100 senators to cut off debate and advance a bill. With the Senate evenly split 50-50, Democrats needed the support of 10 Republicans to move to the commission bill, sparking fresh debate over whether the time has come to change the rules and lower the threshold to 51 votes to take up legislation. The House had already approved the measure with 35 Republican votes. Democrats have warned that if Republicans are willing to use the filibuster to stop an arguably popular measure, it shows the limits of trying to broker compromises, particularly on bills related to election reforms or other aspects of the Democrats’ agenda. “There is no excuse for any Republican to vote against this commission,” said Senator Joe Manchin before the vote though the centrist Democrat still made it clear that he would not support efforts to do away with the filibuster. “I’m not ready to destroy our government,” Manchin said. Before the vote, Gladys Sicknick, the mother of the late Capitol police officer Brian Sicknick, along with Sicknick’s girlfriend Sandra Garza and two officers who fought the protesters that day, met with several Republican senators to try to persuade them to act. Sicknick was among many officers protecting the building, some seen in videos in hand-to-hand combat with the mob. He collapsed immediately after engaging with the rioters and died the next day. In a statement Wednesday, Gladys Sicknick was more blunt: “I suggest that all congressmen and senators who are against this bill visit my son’s grave in Arlington national cemetery and, while there, think about what their hurtful decisions will do to those officers who will be there for them going forward.” Republican opposition to the commission, however, was carefully marshaled by Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who has declared the bill a “purely political exercise”, since Senate committees are already looking into security shortfalls during the Capitol attack. McConnell, who once said Trump was responsible for “provoking” the attack on the Capitol, now says of Democrats: “They’d like to continue to litigate the former president, into the future.”","charCount":"3187","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"Guardian staff"},{"headline":"Manchin criticizes Republican opposition to 6 January commission: ‘There’s no excuse’ – as it happened","standfirst":"<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2021/may/27/joe-biden-republicans-covid-coronavirus-us-politics-latest-updates?page=with:block-60afa3268f08d486a7714c6e#block-60afa3268f08d486a7714c6e\">Senator says: ‘They do not believe the truth will set you free’</a><br></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2021/may/27/joe-biden-republicans-covid-coronavirus-us-politics-latest-updates?page=with:block-60afafd78f088d8c3178aee9#block-60afafd78f088d8c3178aee9\">McConnell dismisses commission as ‘extraneous’</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2021/may/27/joe-biden-republicans-covid-coronavirus-us-politics-latest-updates?page=with:block-60af979d8f086d71cc15c5ef#block-60af979d8f086d71cc15c5ef\">Republicans introduce nearly $1tn infrastructure plan</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/27/democrats-voting-rights-us-senate\">Democrats’ push for voting rights law faces tortuous path</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2018/sep/17/guardian-us-morning-briefing-sign-up-to-stay-informed\">Sign up to receive First Thing – our daily briefing by email</a></li></ul>","trailText":"Senator says ‘They do not believe the truth will set you free’ while Mitch McConnell dismisses commission as ‘extraneous’","byline":"Lois Beckett in Los Angeles (now) and Joan E Greve (earlier)","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3fba3bacb6b3203a5e2cd51fbf8a31a8d7aba8bb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3fba3bacb6b3203a5e2cd51fbf8a31a8d7aba8bb/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Manchin speaks during a Senate appropriations committee hearing.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Manchin speaks during a Senate appropriations committee hearing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<div id=\"block-60b02f678f088d8c3178b598\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-05-28T00:02:55.345Z\">1.02am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Evening summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>We’re wrapping up our live US politics coverage for the night, with key political developments still unfolding, including an expected vote on the creation of a bipartisan commission to investigate Trump supporters’ invasion of the Capitol on 6 January. </p> <p>An updated summary of today’s key news: </p> <ul> <li> <strong>Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn are investigating whether Ukrainian officials attempted to meddle in the 2020 presidential election</strong> to undermine Biden and support Trump, the New York Times reported. The criminal investigation, which had not previously been made public, was opened under the Trump administration, and is separate from a federal investigation into <strong>Rudy Giuliani</strong> and Ukraine that is unfolding in Manhattan, the Times reported. One focus of the investigation is a <strong>Ukrainian politician,</strong><strong> Andriy Derkach,</strong> who was sanctioned last fall by Trump’s Treasury Department and accused of being an active Russian agent. <br></li> <li><strong>Joe Biden touted America’s recent economic rebound in a Cleveland speech. </strong>“Covid cases are down. Covid deaths are down. Unemployment filings are down. Hunger is down. Vaccinations are up. Jobs are up. Growth is up,” the president said at Cuyahoga Community College. “Put it simply, America is coming back. America is on the move.”<br></li> <li><strong>Senator Joe Manchin fiercely criticized his Republican colleagues for opposing the bill to form a bipartisan commission to study the Capitol insurrection. </strong>“There’s no excuse for any Republican to vote against this commission since <strong>Democrats</strong> have agreed to everything they asked for,” the Democratic senator said in a statement. But Manchin told reporters he is still unwilling to eliminate the Senate filibuster in order to get the commission bill passed. <strong>House Majority </strong><strong>Jim Clyburn </strong>said Democrats should move to conduct investigations of 6 January through House committees if Republicans reject a bipartisan commission </li> <li><strong>Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell argued the commission would be “extraneous” to current investigations. </strong>“There’s no new fact about that day we need the Democrats’ extraneous commission to uncover,” McConnell said in a Senate floor speech. The Republican leader appears to have the votes necessary to defeat the commission bill when the Senate takes a procedural vote on the legislation this evening.<br></li> <li><strong>Senate Republicans released their latest offer in the negotiations over an infrastructure bill. </strong>The bill proposes spending $928bn on infrastructure over the next eight years, but most of that money was already going to be spent because of current policies in place. Only $257bn of the Republican proposal is considered new spending, and the White House said the offer still lacks funding for key initiatives.</li> <li><strong>The Biden administration has informed Russia it will not rejoin the Open Skies Treaty, </strong>according to the AP. The decision will almost certainly be a topic of discussion between Biden and Russian President <strong>Vladimir Putin </strong>when they meet for a summit next month in Geneva, Switzerland.</li> </ul> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60b0278f8f088d8c3178b55b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-05-27T23:19:12.187Z\">12.19am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">NYT: Federal prosecutors investigating whether Ukrainian officials tried to meddle in 2020 election</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Federal prosecutors in New York are investigating whether Ukrainian officials attempted to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/27/nyregion/trump-ukraine-rudy-giuliani-2020-presidential-election.html\">interfere in the 2020 presidential election</a> to undermine Biden and help Trump, including by using Rudolph Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer, to spread misinformation, the New York Times reported, citing unnamed sources “with knowledge of the matter”. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/cliffordlevy/status/1398052468001550339\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">NYT SCOOP: Federal prosecutors are investigating whether Ukrainian officials helped orchestrate a wide-ranging plan to meddle in the 2020 campaign, including using Giuliani to spread misleading claims about Biden and tilt the election in Trump’s favor.<a href=\"https://t.co/7QHFvugPcb\">https://t.co/7QHFvugPcb</a></p>&mdash; Cliff Levy (@cliffordlevy) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cliffordlevy/status/1398052468001550339?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 27, 2021</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The existence of the criminal investigation has not previously been reported, the Times wrote, and the investigation is distinct from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/28/rudy-giuliani-apartment-search-warrant-federal-investigators\">another federal investigation in Manhattan that is focused on Giuliani himself</a>.</p> <p>The focus of the newly reported investigation are current and former Ukrainian officials, including a Ukrainian member of parliament who met with Giuliani during a trip to Europe in 2019, and who had previously been identified by the Trump administration as a source of attempted election manipulation, the Times reported. </p> <p>In September, several months before the 2020 election, Trump’s Treasury Department had already <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/10/us/politics/sanctions-russia-ukraine-election-interference.html\">announced sanctions against Andriy Derkach</a> for engaging in “a covert influence campaign” to undermine the election results, and accused him of being “an active Russian agent for over a decade”, the Times reported last fall.</p> <p>“I have no reason to believe he is a Russian agent,” Giuliani told the Times in September. “There is nothing I saw that said he was a Russian agent.

With the Senate evenly split 50-50, Democrats need support of 10 Republicans to move to the commission bill, sparking fresh debate over whether the time has come to change the rules and lower the threshold to 51 votes to take up legislation.</p> <p>Many Democrats are warning that if Republicans are willing to use the filibuster to stop an arguably popular measure, it shows the limits of trying to broker compromises, particularly on bills related to election reforms or other aspects of the Democrats’ agenda.</p> <p>For now, though, Democrats don’t have the votes to change the rule. West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin and Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, both moderate Democrats, have said they want to preserve the filibuster. Manchin said earlier today that there is “no excuse” for Republicans to vote against the commission, but that he is “not ready to destroy our government” by doing away with the procedural tactic.</p> <p>Others, including historian Kevin Kruse, disagreed. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/KevinMKruse/status/1397937869902299136\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">You have it completely backwards, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Sen_JoeManchin?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Sen_JoeManchin</a> -- the *filibuster* is what&#39;s destroying our government. <br><br>It distorts the founders&#39; vision in which a simple majority would control the Senate and lets a spiteful minority hold the government hostage to its whims.

An updated summary of today’s key news: Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn are investigating whether Ukrainian officials attempted to meddle in the 2020 presidential election to undermine Biden and support Trump, the New York Times reported. The criminal investigation, which had not previously been made public, was opened under the Trump administration, and is separate from a federal investigation into Rudy Giuliani and Ukraine that is unfolding in Manhattan, the Times reported. One focus of the investigation is a Ukrainian politician, Andriy Derkach, who was sanctioned last fall by Trump’s Treasury Department and accused of being an active Russian agent. Joe Biden touted America’s recent economic rebound in a Cleveland speech. “Covid cases are down. Covid deaths are down. Unemployment filings are down. Hunger is down. Vaccinations are up. Jobs are up. Growth is up,” the president said at Cuyahoga Community College. “Put it simply, America is coming back. America is on the move.” Senator Joe Manchin fiercely criticized his Republican colleagues for opposing the bill to form a bipartisan commission to study the Capitol insurrection. “There’s no excuse for any Republican to vote against this commission since Democrats have agreed to everything they asked for,” the Democratic senator said in a statement. But Manchin told reporters he is still unwilling to eliminate the Senate filibuster in order to get the commission bill passed. House Majority Jim Clyburn said Democrats should move to conduct investigations of 6 January through House committees if Republicans reject a bipartisan commission Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell argued the commission would be “extraneous” to current investigations. “There’s no new fact about that day we need the Democrats’ extraneous commission to uncover,” McConnell said in a Senate floor speech. The Republican leader appears to have the votes necessary to defeat the commission bill when the Senate takes a procedural vote on the legislation this evening. Senate Republicans released their latest offer in the negotiations over an infrastructure bill. The bill proposes spending $928bn on infrastructure over the next eight years, but most of that money was already going to be spent because of current policies in place. Only $257bn of the Republican proposal is considered new spending, and the White House said the offer still lacks funding for key initiatives. The Biden administration has informed Russia it will not rejoin the Open Skies Treaty, according to the AP. The decision will almost certainly be a topic of discussion between Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin when they meet for a summit next month in Geneva, Switzerland. Federal prosecutors in New York are investigating whether Ukrainian officials attempted to interfere in the 2020 presidential election to undermine Biden and help Trump, including by using Rudolph Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer, to spread misinformation, the New York Times reported, citing unnamed sources “with knowledge of the matter”. The existence of the criminal investigation has not previously been reported, the Times wrote, and the investigation is distinct from another federal investigation in Manhattan that is focused on Giuliani himself. The focus of the newly reported investigation are current and former Ukrainian officials, including a Ukrainian member of parliament who met with Giuliani during a trip to Europe in 2019, and who had previously been identified by the Trump administration as a source of attempted election manipulation, the Times reported. In September, several months before the 2020 election, Trump’s Treasury Department had already announced sanctions against Andriy Derkach for engaging in “a covert influence campaign” to undermine the election results, and accused him of being “an active Russian agent for over a decade”, the Times reported last fall. “I have no reason to believe he is a Russian agent,” Giuliani told the Times in September. “There is nothing I saw that said he was a Russian agent. There is nothing he gave me that seemed to come from Russia at all.” But, he added: “How the hell would I know?” Caitlyn Jenner criticized for confusing comma usage in ‘cancel culture’ tweet Earlier this month, my colleague Andrew Gumbel reported that Caitlyn Jenner’s attempt to mobilize her fame to become the next governor of California was falling flat. Today, the former Olympian and Kardashian step-parent tweeted about “cancel culture” in such a convoluted way that many of the Twitter reactions have simply focused on her comma usage. Focus on the filibuster as GOP prepares to block commission on 6 January Senate Republicans are poised to block the creation of a special commission to study the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, dashing hopes for a bipartisan panel amid a GOP push to put the violent insurrection by Donald Trump’s supporters behind them, the Associated Press reports. Broad Republican opposition was expected in what would be the first successful Senate filibuster of the Biden presidency. The Republican opposition to the bipartisan panel has revived Democratic pressure to do away with the filibuster, a time-honored Senate tradition that requires a vote by 60 of the 100 senators to cut off debate and advance a bill. With the Senate evenly split 50-50, Democrats need support of 10 Republicans to move to the commission bill, sparking fresh debate over whether the time has come to change the rules and lower the threshold to 51 votes to take up legislation. Many Democrats are warning that if Republicans are willing to use the filibuster to stop an arguably popular measure, it shows the limits of trying to broker compromises, particularly on bills related to election reforms or other aspects of the Democrats’ agenda. For now, though, Democrats don’t have the votes to change the rule. West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin and Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, both moderate Democrats, have said they want to preserve the filibuster. Manchin said earlier today that there is “no excuse” for Republicans to vote against the commission, but that he is “not ready to destroy our government” by doing away with the procedural tactic. Others, including historian Kevin Kruse, disagreed. ‘Vax for the Win:’ California launches coronavirus vaccine lottery California will give away $116.5 million to help encourage state residents to get the coronavirus vaccine, SFGate reports, mirroring a similar lottery program launched in Ohio. “We’re pulling out all the stops to get everyone vaccinated by June 15,” the California governor’s account tweeted. Clyburn: House committees must investigate Capitol attack if GOP blocks commission Speaking on CNN ahead of an expected vote on the creation of a bipartisan commission to investigate the 6 January attack, Jim Clyburn is already calling for Democratic action if Senate Republicans block the bill. The NRA’s annual meeting is back and scheduled for this September This is Lois Beckett, picking up our live politics coverage from Los Angeles. The National Rifle Association’s annual meeting for members is back this fall, after being cancelled last year because of the coronavirus pandemic, the gun rights group announced today. The event, which in the past has attracted tens of thousands of gun aficionados, is scheduled for early September in Houston, Texas. It comes as the group continues to face major legal challenges. That’s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Lois Beckett, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here’s where the day stands so far: Joe Biden touted America’s recent economic rebound in a Cleveland speech. “Covid cases are down. Covid deaths are down. Unemployment filings are down. Hunger is down. Vaccinations are up. Jobs are up. Growth is up,” the president said at Cuyahoga Community College. “Put it simply, America is coming back. America is on the move.” Senator Joe Manchin fiercely criticized his Republican colleagues for opposing the bill to form a bipartisan commission to study the Capitol insurrection. “There’s no excuse for any Republican to vote against this commission since Democrats have agreed to everything they asked for,” the Democratic senator said in a statement.

The decision will almost certainly be a topic of discussion between Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin when they meet for a summit next month in Geneva, Switzerland. Lois will have more coming up, so stay tuned. There has been a pause in the Senate votes on amendments to the Endless Frontier Act, and Democratic Senator Ben Cardin is now delivering a floor speech denouncing anti-Semitism. It appears that Senate leaders are trying to work out a deal to speed through the remaining votes on the bill, but they haven’t reached an agreement yet. Once the amendment votes are completed, the Senate will move on to its procedural vote on the 6 January commission bill, but the exact timing on that is still unclear. It may be a long night for the Senate. The Senate has been holding a series of votes on amendments to a science and technology research bill. Once those votes wrap up, the upper chamber will move on to a procedural vote on the 6 January commission bill. Senate Republican leaders have indicated they believe they have the votes to defeat the commission bill, which passed the House with some Republican support last week. Alexandra Villarreal reports for the Guardian: Natalie Jackson, a prominent Florida attorney whose clients include Trayvon Martin’s family, is running to replace Representative Val Demings in Congress next year. Just days into her campaign for the Orlando-based House seat, Jackson has already garnered endorsements from two powerful civil rights champions: attorney Benjamin Crump and Philonise Floyd, George Floyd’s brother. In recent years, Jackson has collaborated with Crump on some of the nation’s most high-profile police violence cases, representing the families of Floyd, Breonna Taylor and others, according to Florida Politics. “What we saw with George Floyd, we saw his family get justice in court. But that five minutes of justice didn’t address the entire criminal justice system, nor did it address the economic inequality in Orange county,” Jackson said. “We need to bring about that type of change. So I feel I can be best suited in the legislature to do that.” The Biden administration has reportedly informed Russia that the US will not rejoin the Open Skies Treaty as Joe Biden prepares for his first in-person meeting with Vladimir Putin next month. The AP reports: U.S. officials said Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman told the Russians that the administration had decided not to reenter the Open Skies Treaty, which had allowed surveillance flights over military facilities in both countries before President Donald Trump withdrew from the pact. Thursday’s decision means only one major arms control treaty between the nuclear powers — the New START treaty — will remain in place. Trump had done nothing to extend New START, which would have expired earlier this year, but after taking office, the Biden administration moved quickly to extend it for five years and opened a review into Trump’s Open Skies Treaty withdrawal. The officials said that the review had been completed and that Sherman had informed Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov of the U.S. decision not to return to Open Skies on Thursday. The officials were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The decision will almost certainly be a topic of discussion between Biden and Putin when the two leaders meet in Geneva, Switzerland, on 16 June. Reporters asked Joe Biden what flavor ice cream he ordered at Honey Hut. “Chocolate, chocolate chip,” the president replied. Asked for his message to Republicans who are opposing the bill to establish a bipartisan commission to study the Capitol insurrection, Biden told them, “Eat some chocolate, chocolate chip.” Elaborating a bit more, Biden added, “I can’t imagine anyone voting against establishing a commission on the greatest assault since the civil war on the Capitol. But at any rate, I came for ice cream.” Before returning to Air Force One to make the trip back to Washington, Joe Biden paid an unexpected visit to Honey Hut Ice Cream in Cleveland to get some of his favorite dessert for the road. The president purchased a scoop of ice cream in a waffle cone, and he posed for a photo with one of the Honey Hut employees. A New York Times photographer captured a high-resolution picture of the list that Joe Biden held up during his remarks in Cleveland. The list identifies Republican lawmakers who have touted the benefits of the American Rescue Plan after they unanimously voted against the bill in Congress. Senator Roger Wicker, House minority leader Kevin McCarthy and House Republican conference chair Elise Stefanik are a few of the names on the list, the picture shows. Joe Biden said the US economy needs to be reimagined to allow working Americans to more directly benefit from the success of the companies they work for. “We must restore the connection between the success of our economy and the people who produce that success, hardworking Americans,” Biden said. “That connection has been severed.” The president argued that rising wages should be a feature, not a bug, of a strong economy. He also pledged that he would judge the success of his economic policy based on how working Americans are faring. “We started seeing the stock market and corporate profits and executive pay as the sole measure of our economic success,” Biden said. “Let me tell you something — my sole measure of economic success is how working families are doing.” Biden also reiterated his call for Congress to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, a proposal that was stripped out of his coronavirus relief package. “No one should work 40 hours a week and live in poverty,” Biden said. The president’s remarks in Cleveland have now concluded, and he will soon start his journey back to Washington. Joe Biden emphasized the need to increase taxes on the wealthiest Americans while reducing the tax burden for working-class citizens. The president criticized Republicans for approving the 2017 tax cuts that disproportionately benefitted the wealthiest Americans. Biden has proposed rolling back those tax cuts to pay for an infrastructure package, but Republicans are adamantly opposed to that. “We had no problem passing a $2 trillion tax plan that went to the top 1% that wasn’t paid for at all. It just increased the debt $2 trillion,” Biden said. “Every time I talk about tax cuts for working-class people, it’s, ‘Oh my God, what are we going to do?’ Well, we’re going to take back some of that 1% money and make them pay for it.” Joe Biden criticized congressional Republicans for touting the benefits of the coronavirus relief package to their constituents after they unanimously opposed it. The president help up a list of Republican lawmakers who have boasted about the benefits of the package for their districts’ businesses and services. “I mean, some people have no shame,” Biden said with a laugh. Speaking in Cleveland, Joe Biden celebrated the reopening of US businesses as more Americans get vaccinated against coronavirus. “We’ve turned the tide on the once-in-a-century pandemic,” Biden said. “And now we’re faced with a question: what kind of economy are we going to build for tomorrow? What are we going to do? I believe this is our moment to rebuild an economy from the bottom up and the middle out.” The president credited his administration with helping to bring back jobs that had disappeared at the beginning of the pandemic and making vaccines widely available. Biden noted that more than 50% of American adults are now fully vaccinated, while that figure was 1% when he took office in January. “Covid cases are down. Covid deaths are down. Unemployment filings are down. Hunger is down. Vaccinations are up. Jobs are up. Growth is up,” Biden said. “Put it simply, America is coming back. America is on the move.” Joe Biden is now delivering remarks on the US economy and vaccination efforts at Cuyahoga Community College in Cleveland, Ohio. Standing in front of signs saying “Blue Collar Blueprint for America,” Biden noted US businesses have been reopening in recent weeks, as vaccinations ramp up. The president also made a joke about Ohio’s million-dollar lottery to encourage residents to get their coronavirus vaccinations. “I hear that Ohio has a new millionaire,” Biden said. Joe Biden is now touring the manufacturing technology center at Cuyahoga Community College in Cleveland, Ohio. Once the tour concludes, the president will deliver remarks on the economy at the community college’s metropolitan campus, so stay tuned. President Biden is planning to meet with Republicans next week after a group of GOP senators presented a revised infrastructure plan, Bloomberg reports. Republicans’ counter-proposal remains more than $1tn short of Biden’s latest proposal. “We’re going to have to close this down soon,” Biden has remarked of his conversations with Republicans. The GOP counter-proposal to Biden’s infrastructure plan is $928bn over eight years, but the majority is money that Congress was already expected to green-light. On Friday, Biden lowered his infrastructure proposal to $1.7tn, down from an initial $2.25tn proposal, Bloomberg says. US intelligence authorities have recognized that the intel community has two theories on the origins of Covid-19. Two agencies believe that coronavirus surfaced naturally due to human contact with infected animals, while a third agency is “embracing a possible laboratory accident as the source of the global pandemic,” Reuters reports. “The U.S. Intelligence Community does not know exactly where, when, or how the COVID-19 virus was transmitted initially but has coalesced around two likely scenarios,” the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) has remarked in a statement Thursday. ODNI also says that the majority of US agencies thinks there is not “sufficient information to assess one to be more likely than the other.” This ODNI statement has not specified which of its 17 agencies thinks Covid-19 came from sick animals, and which agency thinks it came from a lab accident. The ODNI says that these agencies’ beliefs are with “low or moderate confidence”, which means they think the evidence is hardly conclusive. The ODNI’s statement comes one day after President Biden announced that he would “redouble” efforts to probe the origins of Covid-19. Biden has asked the Intelligence Community to report back to him in 90 days on their findings. Biden has said that he would release the report after 90 days “unless there’s something I’m unaware of.” Joe Biden’s administration is facing an onslaught of criticism from environmentalists after opting to defend the approval of a massive oil and gas drilling project in the frigid northern reaches of Alaska. In a briefing filed in federal court on Wednesday, the US Department of Justice said the Trump-era decision to allow the project in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska’s north slope was “reasonable and consistent” with the law and should be allowed to go ahead. This stance means the Biden administration is contesting a lawsuit brought by environmental groups aimed at halting the drilling due to concerns over the impact upon wildlife and planet-heating emissions. The US president has paused all new drilling leases on public land but is allowing this Alaska lease, approved under Trump, to go ahead. The project, known as Willow, is being overseen by the oil company ConocoPhillips and is designed to extract more than 100,000 barrels of oil a day for the next 30 years. Environmentalists say allowing the project is at odds with Biden’s vow to combat the climate crisis and drastically reduce US emissions. “It’s incredibly disappointing to see the Biden administration defending this environmentally disastrous project,” said Kristen Monsell, an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, one of the groups that have sued to stop the drilling. “President Biden promised climate action and our climate can’t afford more huge new oil-drilling projects.” Here’s where the day stands so far: Senator Joe Manchin fiercely criticized his Republican colleagues for opposing the bill to form a bipartisan commission to study the Capitol insurrection. “There’s no excuse for any Republican to vote against this commission since Democrats have agreed to everything they asked for,” the Democratic senator said in a statement. But Manchin told reporters he is still unwilling to eliminate the Senate filibuster in order to get the commission bill passed. Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell argued the commission would be “extraneous” to current investigations. “There’s no new fact about that day we need the Democrats’ extraneous commission to uncover,” McConnell said in a Senate floor speech. The Republican leader appears to have the votes necessary to defeat the commission bill, which passed the House last week. Senate Republicans released their latest offer in the negotiations over an infrastructure bill. The bill proposes spending $928 billion on infrastructure over the next eight years, but most of that money was already going to be spent because of current policies in place. Only $257 billion of the Republican proposal is considered new spending, and the White House said the offer still lacks funding for key initiatives. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. The White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, also released a statement in response to Republicans’ latest infrastructure proposal. “At first review, we note several constructive additions to the group’s previous proposals, including on roads, bridges and rail,” Psaki said. “At the same time, we remain concerned that their plan still provides no substantial new funds for critical job-creating needs, such as fixing our veterans’ hospitals, building modern rail systems, repairing our transit systems, removing dangerous lead pipes, and powering America’s leadership in a job-creating clean energy economy, among other things.” Psaki also expressed hesitation about the Republican proposal to use unspent coronavirus relief funds to help pay for the infrastructure package. Looking at the timeline for passing a bill, Psaki said, “Though there are no votes in Congress next week, we will work actively with members of the House and Senate next week, so that there is a clear direction on how to advance much needed jobs legislation when Congress resumes legislative business during the week of June 7.” Joe Biden took a few questions from reporters before boarding Air Force One to travel to Cleveland, Ohio, for a speech on the economy. Asked about Senate Republicans’ latest counteroffer in the infrastructure negotiations, Biden said he had a brief but positive conversation with Senator Shelley Moore Capito about the new proposal. “I haven’t had a chance yet to go over the details of the counteroffer made by Capito,” Biden said. “We’re going to meet sometime next week, and we’ll see if we can move that.” Echoing Senate Democrats, the president emphasized the need to wrap up the infrastructure negotiations in the coming weeks. “I told her we have to finish this really soon,” Biden said. “We’re going to have to close this down soon.” Some Senate Democrats are already pushing to use reconciliation to pass an infrastructure bill, thus avoiding a potential Republican filibuster of the legislation. The family of Officer Brian Sicknick met with several Republican senators as the Senate prepares to vote on the bill to establish a bipartisan commission to study the Capitol insurrection. One of those senators, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, said in a statement that he offered his condolences to the family of Sicknick, the US Capitol Police officer who died of a stroke the day after the January 6 insurrection. In his statement, Johnson emphasized that the insurrectionists “should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law,” but he did not agree with the family on the need for a commission to study the attack. “Although we respectfully disagreed on the added value of the proposed commission, I did commit to doing everything I could to ensure all their questions will be answered,” Johnson said. Senate Republicans are poised to use the filibuster to defeat the commission bill, which passed the House last week. The family of Officer Brian Sicknick is on Capitol Hill today, meeting with senators and pushing them to support establishing a bipartisan commission to study the January 6 insurrection. Sicknick was a US Capitol Police officer who died the day after the insurrection. He collapsed shortly after clashing with rioters, and he later died at a nearby hospital. A medical examiner said last month that Sicknick died after suffering two strokes. Asked how she felt listening to Republicans who oppose establishing a commission, Gladys Sicknick, the mother of Brian Sicknick, told reporters, “This is why I’m here today. I mean, usually I’ll stay in the background, and I just couldn’t stay quiet anymore.” Senator Joe Manchin indicated he was not open to eliminating the filibuster in order to get the January 6 commission bill passed. “I’m not willing to destroy our government, no,” the Democratic senator told reporters on Capitol Hill. Manchin added, “I think we’ll come together. You have to have faith there’s 10 good people.” According to CNN, Senate Republican leaders are confident they have the votes necessary to defeat the commission bill today. Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer lamented that the January 6 commission bill cannot secure widespread bipartisan support in Congress. Reflecting on how the “big lie” of widespread election fraud in the presidential election has overtaken the Republican party, Schumer said the country must put a stop to this “cancer” in the GOP. The Democratic leader specifically criticized Republican legislators in Arizona for “chasing a bananas-crazy right-wing Internet conspiracy” that China tampered with ballots to swing the election to Joe Biden. “We need to stand up to the big lie,” Schumer said. “We must get at the truth and do everything in our power to restore Americans faith in our elections and this grand, ongoing, noble experiment of democracy.” With that goal in mind, Schumer said a bipartisan commission to study the Capitol insurrection is “exactly what the doctor ordered”. Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell dismissed the idea of forming a bipartisan commission to study the Capitol insurrection, arguing that such a panel would be “extraneous” to the current investigations underway at the justice department and in Congress. McConnell’s comments in a Senate floor speech this morning came as Republicans prepared to block the House-approved bill to convene a 6 January commission. If Republicans do block the bill, it may mark the first official use of the Senate filibuster in this session of Congress. “There’s no new fact about that day we need the Democrats’ extraneous commission to uncover,” McConnell said moments ago. The Republican leader noted that more than 440 people have already been arrested in connection to the Capitol insurrection and the attorney general has promised to maintain the investigation of the attack as a top priority for the justice department. Democrats have pointed out that much remains unknown about the Capitol attack, including some insurrectionists’ potential ties to Republican lawmakers. “I do not believe the additional extraneous commission that Democratic leaders want would uncover crucial new facts or promote healing,” McConnell said. “Frankly, I do not believe it is even designed to do that.” McConnell added: “I’ll continue to urge my colleagues to oppose this extraneous layer when the time comes for the Senate to vote.” Democratic Senator Bob Casey signaled this morning that it may be time to move on from negotiating with Republicans and instead pass an infrastructure bill using reconciliation, allowing Democrats to circumvent the Senate filibuster. Asked whether it was time to focus on setting up a reconciliation pathway for the infrastructure bill, Casey told CNN anchor Jim Sciutto, “I think we’re getting to that point, Jim. It’s an old expression, fish or cut bait.” Casey said Joe Biden had done “really good work here to engage Republican senators,” but he argued it was time for negotiations to come to a conclusion. “I do think we’re getting to the last chapter of this,” Casey said. “Now the last chapter could result in an agreement, but it could also result in no agreement.” Casey expressed a desire to move on to Democrats’ “next set of agenda items,” like funding universal pre-kindergarten and two years of community college for American families. The Guardian’s Sam Levine and Daniel Strauss report: After six months of aggressive Republican efforts to restrict voting access, Democrats are facing new questions about how they will actually pass voting rights reforms through Congress. The most recent hand-wringing comes as Joe Manchin, the West Virginia Democratic senator, made clear earlier this month he still is not on board with the For the People Act, which would require early voting, automatic and same-day registration, and prevent the severe manipulation of district boundaries for partisan gain. Senate Democrats, including Manchin, met privately on Wednesday to map out a path forward on the bill, which has already passed the US House. Senator Raphael Warnock of Georgia said: “I think members of the caucus understand the urgency and we’re focused on getting something passed. We have an obligation to the American people to find a way to protect our democracy.” Manchin’s opposition comes at a critical moment when there is escalating concern about aggressive state Republican efforts to curtail access to the ballot. Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Iowa and Montana have all put new restrictions in place this year. Many see this as an existential moment for the Democratic party and fear that Republicans will permanently reap the benefits of a distorted electoral system if Democrats cannot pass federal legislation. There is heightened urgency to act quickly so that crucial protections can be in place when the once-per-decade redistricting process gets under way later this year. Senator Joe Manchin has released a statement fiercely criticizing his Republican colleagues for opposing the bill to create a 9/11-style commission to study the Capitol insurrection. “There’s no excuse for any Republican to vote against this commission since Democrats have agreed to everything they asked for,” the Democratic senator said. Singling out the Senate minority leader, Manchin said, “Mitch McConnell has made this his political position, thinking it will help his 2022 elections. They do not believe the truth will set you free, so they continue to live in fear.” Senate Republicans are poised to block the passage of the 6 January commission bill using the filibuster, which requires 60 votes for approval. The question now becomes whether Manchin would be willing to scrap the filibuster to get the commission bill through the Senate. Manchin has been a fierce defender of the filibuster, and he has previously indicated he is not willing to eliminate it. Moments after Senate Republicans concluded their press conference, one of their Democratic colleagues offered some criticism of their latest infrastructure proposal. “I don’t really think this is a serious counteroffer,” Senator Elizabeth Warren told MSNBC. The Democratic senator added that the Republicans’ proposal to redirect unused coronavirus relief funds toward infrastructure would not win any fans in the White House. Shelley Moore Capito argued that Senate Republicans and Joe Biden are actually closer on an infrastructure deal than their topline numbers would suggest. The Republican senator said she believed they could reach an agreement if Biden removed funding for issues like elder care and green energy from his plan, which would bring them much closer to an agreed-upon cost for the bill. “I think the gaps are much less,” Capito told reporters. However, Biden has consistently argued that the green energy sector and the care economy are critical parts of American infrastructure and must be included in this bill. Something else to keep in mind: most of the latest Republican plan reflects baseline spending on infrastructure items. The baseline number indicates how much the US will spend on infrastructure if the current level of activity continues, adjusting for inflation. The $928 billion figure actually includes only $257 billion in new infrastructure spending over that baseline number. That works out to spending an additional $32 billion or so on infrastructure in each of the next eight years, which will not likely please Joe Biden and his team. It’s also important to keep in mind that much of the spending proposed by Senate Republicans comes from unused coronavirus relief funds. Joe Biden and his team have indicated they are not at all pleased with the idea of redirecting coronavirus relief money to infrastructure. But Republicans have said they are adamantly opposed to rolling back the Trump-era tax cuts to pay for the infrastructure plan, which is what Biden originally proposed. Shelley Moore Capito said Senate Republicans’ latest $928 billion infrastructure offer is “sticking with the core elements of infrastructure”. The Republican negotiators have consistently clashed with Joe Biden over how to define infrastructure as it relates to items that will be included in this massive bill. For example, the president and his team have proposed massive investments in the green energy sector, but Republicans have been far less inclined to include that funding in this bill. Senate Republicans are now formally introducing their counteroffer to Joe Biden’s infrastructure plan at a press conference on Capitol Hill. The Republican negotiating team, led by Senator Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, is calling for spending $928bn over eight years to strengthen America’s infrastructure systems. That proposal includes an increase of $91bn to improve roads and bridges and $48bn more to invest in water infrastructure. “Senate Republicans continue to negotiate in good faith,” Capito said. “We’re trying to get to that common goal of reaching a bipartisan infrastructure agreement.” However, the new Republican proposal is still far less than the $1.7tn plan that Joe Biden’s team outlined in their counteroffer last week. Greetings from Washington, live blog readers. Senate Republicans will soon hold a press conference on Capitol Hill to introduce their latest counteroffer to Joe Biden’s infrastructure plan. The new Republican plan is expected to cost around $1tn, which is nearly double the cost of their initial infrastructure proposal. However, $1tn would still be far less than what the president has called for spending. Biden originally outlined a $2.25tn plan, but he counteroffered with a $1.7tn proposal last week. According to reports, Biden indicated to Senate Republicans in a meeting last week that he would be comfortable with $1tn as the topline number for an infrastructure bill. However, at that cost, many items will probably be left out of the final legislation, which could frustrate Democrats, some of whom are pushing to pass the bill using reconciliation and thus bypass Senate Republicans. If Biden rejects the latest Republican offer, reconciliation may be the only way to get an infrastructure bill passed. The Republican press conference will begin in about 20 minutes, so stay tuned.","charCount":"37189","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/lois-beckett\">Lois Beckett</a> in Los Angeles (now) and <a href=\"profile/joan-greve\">Joan E Greve</a> (earlier)"},{"headline":"Amazon’s mental health kiosk mocked on social media as a ‘Despair Closet’","standfirst":"<p>AmaZen, a small box for employees’ ‘mental wellbeing’, came under fire as critics called out the company’s problematic working conditions</p>","trailText":"AmaZen, a small box for employees’ ‘mental wellbeing’, came under fire as critics called out the company’s problematic working conditions","byline":"Kari Paul","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bea6cf544cc77c2fe84cbc6bd3881d07497465b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bea6cf544cc77c2fe84cbc6bd3881d07497465b0/545_484_4079_2449/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amazon on Thursday launched its ‘AmaZen’ booth where employees can ‘focus on their mental well-being’.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amazon on Thursday launched its ‘AmaZen’ booth where employees can ‘focus on their mental well-being’.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NurPhoto/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Amazon was lampooned on social media Thursday after sharing a video highlighting “AmaZen”, a small enclosed booth installed in an Amazon warehouse where employees can go to “focus on their mental wellbeing”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/apr/15/amazon-must-do-a-better-job-for-its-workers-says-jeff-bezos\">Amazon must ‘do a better job’ for its workers, says Jeff Bezos</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The human-sized box has an interactive kiosk inside, where workers can watch videos about “mental health” and “mindfulness practices”.

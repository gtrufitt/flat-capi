Things get impressively meta for the early 20th-century as the couple fell in love at a production of Shaw’s play Candida. In Overruled, four married people who have agreed to take separate holidays collide at the same hotel, where church vows stretch in a more daring forebear of Coward’s Private Lives.</p> <p>Two of the cast – Dorothea Myer-Bennett and Jordan Mifsúd – play a different wife or husband in each half, nicely differentiating strategies of vanity and passion. They – and equally impressive colleagues, Joe Bolland, Alex Bhat, and Hara Yannas – strike a heightened, almost spoken-operatic style that hits every joke. A combination of heritage frocks with modern-ish fashion – leather jacket, man-bun, trainers – subtly suggests the line of descent from Wilde and Shaw through Coward to the betrayal games in Harold Pinter’s The Lover.</p> <ul> <li><p>At the <a href=\"https://orangetreetheatre.co.uk/\">Orange Tree, London</a>, until 26 June.

One would think you were my husband.” While Shaw, characteristically, devoted 15 pages before the first stage direction of Overruled to a treatise on whether having more than one spouse would actually work in Edwardian society, Miller plays the propositions sharp and fast, focusing on the absurd geometries of human desire. How He Lied to Her Husband turns on married aristocrat Aurora telling her poet lover, Henry, that her husband, Teddy, has discovered the fervent love verses written in illicit heat. Things get impressively meta for the early 20th-century as the couple fell in love at a production of Shaw’s play Candida. In Overruled, four married people who have agreed to take separate holidays collide at the same hotel, where church vows stretch in a more daring forebear of Coward’s Private Lives. Two of the cast – Dorothea Myer-Bennett and Jordan Mifsúd – play a different wife or husband in each half, nicely differentiating strategies of vanity and passion. They – and equally impressive colleagues, Joe Bolland, Alex Bhat, and Hara Yannas – strike a heightened, almost spoken-operatic style that hits every joke. A combination of heritage frocks with modern-ish fashion – leather jacket, man-bun, trainers – subtly suggests the line of descent from Wilde and Shaw through Coward to the betrayal games in Harold Pinter’s The Lover.

Most obviously, a new U.S. administration that is not so openly anti-China has led some former skeptics to reconsider the existing evidence.

This was an unprecedented situation, it was a national effort involving all parts of government, and all parts of the country. I think the public will appreciate, if you think back to the events of this time last year, how challenging it really was.

I’ll be with you for the next few hours. We’ve just published this from <strong>Dr Deepti Gurdasani</strong>, who is a clinical epidemiologist and senior lecturer in machine learning at Queen Mary University of London:</em></p> \n  <p>Amid the select committee revelations from <strong>Dominic Cummings</strong>, and in his recent claims on social media, there has been a lot of focus on suggestions that the UK government was following a “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/23/priti-patel-denies-cummings-claim-herd-immunity-was-ever-uk-policy\">herd immunity</a>” policy at the start of the pandemic, costing thousands of lives in the process. Of course, none of this is surprising.</p> \n  <p>It is very clear that this was the flawed policy of the government through early March last year, not least because it was publicly discussed by the <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/health/boris-johnson-coronavirus-this-morning/\">prime minister</a> and by many <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Kilsally/status/1238780879050326016?s=20\">scientific advisers</a> to the government – including <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XRc389TvG8\">Patrick Vallance</a>, who spoke of “enough people becoming immune to this” with mild illness, to help build herd immunity.</p> \n  <p>The alternative strategy of high suppression or elimination of the virus was rejected by the government very early on, despite strong evidence from other countries around the world showing that this could be successfully applied.</p> \n  <p>There were several elements that underpinned the devastating herd immunity strategy. It was believed that infection of large swathes of the population was inevitable, and acceptable, and that there was no way to prevent it. This came with the tacit acknowledgment that hundreds of thousands of deaths were acceptable, most of which would occur among vulnerable and elderly people. A sense of national exceptionalism held by some suggested that other countries’ experiences didn’t apply to us – despite that by March we had had months to observe and learn from countries in south Asia, and seeing the devastating impact of late action in Italy.</p> \n  <p>Real-world evidence was ignored in favour of models and flawed thinking. The government’s strategy repeatedly conflated Covid-19 with flu, ignoring the much higher transmissibility, higher susceptibility, which would lead to many more people getting infected and dying, and unknown long-term impacts from a novel virus. Finally, there was the idea that the health of the economy needed to be balanced with public health. A lot of emphasis was placed on the disruption lockdowns would cause, with attempts to slow down such decisions, without understanding that delays would inevitably lead to even longer lockdowns and more economic damage.</p> \n  <p><strong>Read more here: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/may/27/government-covid-strategy-herd-immunity-westminster\">Deepti Gurdasani – The UK government’s Covid strategy was discredited but we’re still paying the price</a></strong></p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/may/27/government-covid-strategy-herd-immunity-westminster\">The government's Covid strategy was discredited but we're still paying the price | Deepti Gurdasani</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-05-27T06:14:03.432Z\">at 7.14am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-60af35588f088d8c3178a79d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-05-27T06:00:22.782Z\">7.00am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Facebook to allow posts saying Covid ‘man-made’</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>This is <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2020/04/covid-19-misinfo-update/#removing-more-false-claims\">Facebook’s statement</a> on its change of policy: </p> \n  <p>In light of ongoing investigations into the origin of Covid-19 and in consultation with public health experts, we will no longer remove the claim that COVID-19 is man-made or manufactured from our apps.

As noted earlier, Taiwan has reported 401 new local cases confirmed today, 13 deaths, and an additional 266 backlogged results from the previous week. It is an indicator that the island’s worst outbreak of the pandemic is still spreading consistently despite restrictions on social movement. Update on earlier post: Thousands of English football fans coming to Porto for Saturday’s Champions League final will not have to stay in bubbles and will not face curbs on movement during their stays, Portuguese police have confirmed. Porto police superintendent Cardoso da Silva told a news briefing. The borders are open. The city and the country are opening up little by little. Within what is possible, freedom (of movement) will not be conditioned. There are no restrictions of movement for fans. The Morrison government has come under attack over “failed” quarantine arrangements and the sluggish pace of the national vaccine rollout as Victoria enters a seven-day “circuit breaker” lockdown. There is mounting concern the latest virus wave could have become “uncontrollable” with almost 30 cases in the Melbourne-based cluster. The acting Victorian premier, James Merlino, on Thursday pointed to vaccine delays and “aged care facilities where not one person has been vaccinated” as practical problems in managing the response. Both are the responsibility of the federal government. You can read the full story by my colleagues Katharine Murphy and Sarah Martin here: Russia has administered at least one dose of a Covid vaccine to almost 17m people, the RIA news agency has cited health minister Mikhail Murashko as saying. The figure suggests Russia has given the first dose of one of its vaccines to about 3m people in the past two weeks. Deputy Prime Minister Tatiana Golikova said on 12 May that 14m Russians had received one vaccine dose, according to Reuters. Some of Russia’s regions have complained that the vaccination process is not going fast enough despite the country having begun rolling out its Sputnik V shot in December. This has been shared by ABC 7.30. In Australia, the Northern Territory government has said domestic arrivals from Melbourne’s highest risk exposure sites must self-isolate and get tested, rather than enter supervised quarantine at Howard Springs, a government run quarantine facility. Hello everyone, this is Yohannes Lowe. I’ll be running the blog until the evening (UK time). As always, feel free to get in touch on Twitter if you have any story tips. Joe Biden has ordered the US intelligence community to ‘redouble’ its efforts studying the origins of coronavirus, adding that it will continue to press for China to participate in a full investigation. China has pushed back, saying that the US “does not care about facts and truth, nor is it interested in serious scientific origin tracing.” Facebook is changing its policy to allow posts saying Covid is “man-made”. A statement from the US tech giant said “In light of ongoing investigations into the origin of Covid-19 and in consultation with public health experts, we will no longer remove the claim that Covid-19 is man-made or manufactured from our apps.” Japan pledged on Thursday to keep in close contact with Olympics stakeholders at home and abroad to ensure a safe and secure Games even as it prepared to extend a state of emergency across much of the nation, including host city Tokyo. The head of a Japanese doctors union warned holding the Olympic Games in Tokyo this summer, with tens of thousands of people gathering from around the world, could lead to the development of a new “Olympic” strain of the coronavirus. India is changing its approach to vaccines – announcing that it has scrapped local trials for “well-established” foreign coronavirus vaccines to fast-track imports. The government said it was in talks with Pfizer for “earliest possible” imports of its shots and that it had also had discussions with Johnson &amp; Johnson and Moderna. Taiwan has reported 401 new local cases confirmed today, 13 deaths, and an additional 266 backlogged results from the previous week, in a sign that the island’s worst outbreak of the pandemic is still spreading consistently despite restrictions on social movement. Taiwan’s president has accused China of interfering in its vaccine acquisition. President Tsai Ing-wen said Taiwan had made successful deals for AstraZeneca and Moderna, and were engaging with BioNTech for the Pfizer vaccine. “We had almost completed the contract signing with the German manufacturer at one point, but it has been delayed till now because China has interfered. Ireland’s health minister has said it was unclear whether enough supplies of Covid-19 vaccines would arrive in the country by the end of June to meet the government’s target of administering at least one dose to 82% of all adults. The European Commission demanded an urgent court order requiring AstraZeneca to deliver millions more vaccines to the bloc or face a hefty fine, in a case that may reflect its anger more than its need for doses. From 8am this morning, all adults in Northern Ireland have been able to book a vaccination. Switzerland is to re-open indoor restaurants and people will no longer be required to work from home, the government announced, saying it was lifting restrictions faster than previously planned. Two Covid-19 vaccines from China’s Sinopharm showed more than 70% efficacy against symptomatic cases, but it remains unclear how much protection they provide against severe or asymptomatic cases, according to the first detailed result of a large late-stage study published to the public. French pharmaceutical giant Sanofi and Britain’s GSK have announced the start of final tests of their belated Covid vaccine as they race to add their jab to the world’s arsenal against the pandemic. A major Australian retail group has been hit with $630,000 in fines for multiple breaches of consumer law related to pandemic-related health products, including hand sanitiser with alcohol levels far lower than advertised. British politics is almost entirely dominated today by responses to yesterday’s assertions by former government adviser Dominic Cummings about how the UK government handled the pandemic. Andrew Sparrow has the latest on our UK live blog… Yohannes Lowe will be with you shortly to take you through the rest of the day. In a not entirely unexpected move, China has this morning pushed back against new moves to investigate the origins of the novel coronavirus in Wuhan. It accused the Biden administration in the US of playing politics and shirking its responsibility in calling for a renewed investigation. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at a daily briefing that President Joe Biden’s order showed the US “does not care about facts and truth, nor is it interested in serious scientific origin tracing.” Biden told US intelligence officials to redouble their efforts to investigate the origins of the pandemic, including any possibility the trail might lead to a Chinese laboratory. After months of minimizing that possibility as a fringe theory, the Biden administration is joining worldwide pressure on China to be more open about the outbreak, in part aiming to head off domestic US complaints from Republican that the president has not been tough enough to press China on alleged obstruction. Regular watcher of US-China relations will know that in the daily press briefings Zhao usually has something to say about the US, and today has said the country must open itself up to investigations into its biological laboratories, including at the military’s Fort Detrick base. “The US side claims that it wants China to participate in a comprehensive, transparent, evidence-based international investigation,” Zhao said. “We would like to ask the US side to do the same as China and immediately cooperate with the World Health Organization on origin tracing research in a scientific manner.” Ireland’s health minister has said it was unclear whether enough supplies of Covid-19 vaccines would arrive in the country by the end of June to meet the government’s target of administering at least one dose to 82% of all adults. Half of Ireland’s 3.8 million adult population will have received at least one dose by the end of this week, Stephen Donnelly told parliament. But he cautioned that there was continued uncertainty around the arrival of AstraZeneca and in particular Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines. Reuters report that Ireland had been due to receive 600,000 shots of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s one-dose Janssen vaccine in the April-June period but only 26,400 shots had been delivered as of 9 May, with the vast majority set to be delivered next month. “For June we were contracted to receive about 470,000 doses of Janssen. The best case I have as of this morning is that we would receive about half of that and the worst case could be as low as around 60,000 in June,” Donnelly said. “With regards to AstraZeneca, we don’t know yet but as we know unfortunately, the supplies from AstraZeneca have consistently been under. The company has not been able to give detail as to how much it will be under for June.” Catarina Demony and Silvio Castellanos report from Porto that as thousands of English football fans flock to Portugal’s city of Porto for Saturday’s Champions League final, hotels and bars are hoping the tourism boost will be a prelude to their emergence from a collapse brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic. “It is definitely a boost for most hotels,” hotel general manager Francisco Brito told Reuters as a couple checked in behind him. “No one ever thought we could experience such a brutal hit ... it is a huge satisfaction to be back in business.” Portugal’s once-booming tourism sector suffered its worst results since the mid-1980s last year as Covid-19 grounded flights and kept visitors away. Tourism businesses across Porto have been mostly empty, leaving workers in a tight spot. Many were pushed into unemployment. Those who managed to stay afloat breathed a sigh of relief when this month UEFA moved the final from Istanbul to Porto’s Dragao Stadium after Turkey was added to the British government’s coronavirus travel-ban “red list”. Some of the city’s hotels were able to finally reopen as demand grew exponentially due to the match, Brito said. Although most of the 16,500 fans who will be allowed into the stadium will have to complete the trip within 24 hours of the final and remain in a bubble during their stay, many others have been travelling to Porto to support their teams from the sidelines. Olivier Ramadas, co-owner of sports bar Adega, said calls and emails from fans wanting to book a table for match day started pouring on the day of UEFA’s announcement. “When we received the news we felt a huge joy,” he said as English fans who arrived a few days early drank pints of beer and chatted. “It will revive the city.” Two Covid-19 vaccines from China’s Sinopharm showed more than 70% efficacy against symptomatic cases, but it remains unclear how much protection they provide against severe or asymptomatic cases, according to the first detailed result of a large late-stage study published to the public. A vaccine developed by a Wuhan-based subsidiary of Sinopharm was 72.8% effective against symptomatic COVID-19 at least two weeks after second injection, based on interim results, the peer-reviewed study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association showed on Wednesday. Reuters note that this is slightly better than the 72.5% rate announced in a company statement in February. Another vaccine developed by a Beijing-based institute linked to Sinopharm, which this month obtained emergency use approval by the World Health Organization, showed a 78.1% efficacy, the paper said. India is changing its approach to vaccines – announcing that it has scrapped local trials for “well-established” foreign coronavirus vaccines to fast-track imports. The country has been inoculating its people with the AstraZeneca vaccine produced locally at the Serum Institute, Covaxin made by local firm Bharat Biotech, and has begun rolling out Russia’s Sputnik V. But supplies are far short of the millions of doses the world’s second-most populous country needs. The government said it was in talks with Pfizer for “earliest possible” imports of its shots and that it had also had discussions with Johnson &amp; Johnson and Moderna. Last month, India pledged to fast-track approvals for foreign vaccines but its insistence on local trials was a key reason for stalled discussions with Pfizer. “The provision has now been further amended to waive the trial requirement altogether for the well-established vaccines manufactured in other countries,” the government said in a statement. None of drugmakers has sent in applications for approval with India’s drugs regulator, it said. Reuters have reported that desperate Indian states have been launching global tenders or seeking expressions of interest from firms including Pfizer and Moderna, but vaccine makers said they would only talk with the federal government. The government said supplies were tight. “The fact that global tenders have not given any results only reaffirms what we have been telling the states from day one: that vaccines are in short supply in the world and it is not easy to procure them at short notice,” it said. Andrew Sparrow is up and running for the day with our UK Covid live blog, so the latest fall-out from the Dominic Cummings revelations will be with him over there, and I’ll be continuing with global coronavirus news here. Indonesia has resumed usage of a temporarily suspended batch of AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine, the country’s food and drug agency (BPOM) said this morning. Reuters report that the agency suspended use of one batch of the vaccine to conduct an investigation after a young man died after being inoculated earlier this month. “According to test results, it can be concluded that there was no relation between the quality of Covid-19 vaccine batch number CTMAV547 with the post immunization event reported,” said BPOM. The hotline for booking a Covid-19 vaccine in Australia was unavailable for hours following the Victorian government’s decision to open up vaccinations to those aged over 40. As the acting premier, James Merlino, announced Victoria would go into a seven-day lockdown to get on top of a growing number of cases of Covid-19, he announced people aged between 40 and 49 would be able to get the Pfizer vaccine at state-run clinics from Friday. Merlino said it would be a matter for the federal government on whether the vaccine would be available for those in that age group at GP surgeries, but said the decision was arrived at due to frustration over the slow pace of the vaccine rollout. “If we had the vaccine, the commonwealth’s vaccine program effectively rolled out, we may well not be here today talking about these circuit-breaker restrictions that we must impose to keep our community safe.” Read more here: Victoria’s hotline for booking Covid vaccines crashes after being inundated with calls Joe Biden has ordered the US intelligence community to ‘redouble’ its efforts studying the origins of coronavirus, adding that it will continue to press for China to participate in a full investigation. The deputy White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre confirmed the investigation would include any possibility the trail might lead to a Chinese lab. “China wasn’t transparent enough,” she said. “We have been saying that for a very long time, that China needed to provide more access to the lab, cooperate more fully with the scientific investigators.” Adam Taylor at the Washington Post has this to say about the re-emergence of theories about a Wuhan lab leak being the source of the novel coronavirus. He writes: Well over a year since a novel coronavirus began to spread in Wuhan, the idea that the deadly outbreak could be linked to a virus research center in the Chinese city has lingered, unproven but not eliminated. Although the resurgent chatter may suggest new clues or proof, the inverse is in fact true. It is the persistent absence of any convincing evidence either for or against the theory that has prompted calls for more investigation. At least publicly, the evidence in favor of a link between the outbreak and the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) has not changed significantly in months, and many virologists still have persistent doubts that such a link exists. What has clearly changed, however, is the political debate. Most obviously, a new U.S. administration that is not so openly anti-China has led some former skeptics to reconsider the existing evidence. And public health experts — most of whom never ruled out the lab theory outright — have expressed disappointment with a World Health Organization-backed investigation that dismissed a link between WIV and the outbreak. Read more here: Washington Post – The Wuhan lab-leak theory is getting more attention. That’s because key evidence is still missing A major Australian retail group has been hit with $630,000 in fines for multiple breaches of consumer law related to pandemic-related health products, including hand sanitiser with alcohol levels far lower than advertised, the consumer watchdog has announced. Mosaic Brands Limited, an ASX-listed retail conglomerate that counts Katies, Rivers, Noni B and Rockmans among its stable of brands, has admitted to making false or misleading claims pertaining to hand sanitiser and face mask products between March and June 2020. The deputy chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, Delia Rickard, said they were particularly concerned about the misleading claims because they were made during a global pandemic. The fines come following tests by Choice, which found that the group was selling hand sanitiser with alcohol levels far lower than advertised. Choice issued a complaint to the ACCC, which conducted independent tests and found “one of the sanitisers tested contained an alcohol content of 17% and another had an alcohol content of 58%, below the percentage advertised on Mosaic Brands’ websites in each case. This was also below the minimum 60% alcohol concentration recommended by Australian health authorities,” Rickard said. Read more here: Australian retailer Mosaic Brands fined $630,000 for misleading hand sanitiser claims UK housing minister Robert Jenrick must be thrilled he got the job of facing the media this morning. He’s just had Susanna Reid open his section with the simple question: “Where is the prime minister this morning?” Zachary Wolf at CNN had this an analysis overnight on how the US government now sees the search for the origins of the global pandemic as an intelligence-led operation. He writes: Intel operation, not scientific inquiry. Biden wants the intelligence community to cooperate with other elements of the government, but getting to the bottom of how this disease occurred, at least in the eyes of the president dealing with obstruction from China, is now fully an intelligence operation. But that order likely poses a complicated challenge for intelligence agencies, which, as CNN has repeatedly reported, are limited in their ability to confidently answer the question of what actually happened. While the intelligence community has been actively engaged on the issue since it broke, Biden’s order is a public call for more, despite the fact that it has been unable to make significant progress for more than a year. So it’s the CIA, not the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that the government is now looking to. And it’s the scientists, who were adamant a year ago that the lab theory was extremely unlikely, now saying it needs more exploration. That appears to be what caused this change. But while intelligence professionals have been more cautious in characterizing their own findings, the lack of apparent progress over the last year should temper expectations, especially considering that China is uninterested or unwilling to help any effort aimed at discovering the truth. Read more here: CNN – The origin of Covid is now an intelligence operation Taiwan has reported 401 new local cases confirmed today, 13 deaths, and an additional 266 backlogged results from the previous week, in a sign that the island’s worst outbreak of the pandemic is still spreading consistently despite restrictions on social movement. Among the 13 deaths - the highest daily toll for Taiwan so far - was a woman in her 40s. Health and welfare minister Chen Chih-Shung said most of the fatalities were elderly people. More than half of the new cases were in people under the age of 40, including 45 children aged up to nine. The new cases remain concentrated in the northern cities of New Taipei and Taipei. Issues with Taiwan’s test recording system has resulted in a backlog of thousands of results, with clearance work producing hundreds of cases to revised totals each day, making it difficult to determine clear trends. The number of backlogged cases is reportedly still growing as more tests come in, despite clearance efforts. Taiwan remains under a level 3 alert, which is not a full lockdown but instead restricts personal gatherings to five indoors and 10 outdoors, encourages but does not require working from home, and which has ordered entertainment and recreation venues to close. Yesterday restaurants were ordered to transition to takeaway services only. Alarmed by their first significant outbreak since the pandemic began, Taiwan’s population has largely complied with both mandatory and requested restrictions, staying home and avoiding travel. Almost 1500 people are in centralised quarantine facilities, established for people with asymptomatic or mild cases of Covid-19 to reduce pressure on hospitals - several of which have recorded their own clusters of infections. Chen has said Taiwan will only move to level 4 alert - a lockdown - if there are 14 consecutive days of more than 100 cases (a milestone likely to be reached tomorrow), with 50% untraced (which has not been reached - just 145 of the total caseload remain unsourced). “I’m just off to drive forward the vaccine programme and then I’ll be going to the House of Commons and I’ll answer questions there.” That’s UK health minister Matt Hancock leaving his house this morning, being asked if the country can still have confidence in him. It was a suit today, not his running gear like yesterday. As you might expect, UK health secretary Matt Hancock is to respond today to those accusations by Dominic Cummings yesterday that he repeatedly lied and that he should have been fired 15 or 20 times over his handling of the early days of the pandemic. Hancock is to answer urgent questions in parliament at 10.30am and will later lead a Downing Street press conference, likely to be around 17.00. French pharmaceutical giant Sanofi and Britain’s GSK have announced the start of final tests of their belated Covid vaccine as they race to add their jab to the world’s arsenal against the pandemic. AFP state that the companies reported positive results from interim human trials earlier this month after a disappointing outcome from initial studies last year left France without its own vaccine. Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline have started enrolment for Phase 3 of a clinical study that will include more than 35,000 adult volunteers at sites in the United States, Asia, Africa and Latin America, the firms said. Sanofi and GSK will also study their vaccine’s ability to work as a booster shot in people who had previously received another vaccine. The Phase 2 trials already showed a strong immune response after a single shot in participants who had previously contracted the coronavirus. The companies hope to launch their vaccine by the end of 2021 - one year after Pfizer and Moderna jabs were approved by regulators. “We have adapted our vaccine development strategy based on forward-looking considerations as the virus continues to evolve, as well as anticipating what may be needed in a post-pandemic setting,” Sanofi executive vice president Thomas Triomphe said in a statement. Like most of the other jabs in circulation, the Sanofi-GSK vaccine would require two doses. Taiwan’s president has accused China of interfering in its vaccine acquisition, as the island continues to battle hundreds of daily new cases of Covid-19 with low supplies of vaccines. Taiwan has received about 700,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine so far, for a population of 24 million. While the island had been largely Covid-free since the pandemic began, an outbreak in late April has so far infected more than 5,000 people, and killed at least 47. Less than 2% of the population are vaccinated. President Tsai Ing-wen said Taiwan had made successful deals for AstraZeneca from the UK and Moderna from the US, and were engaging with Germany’s BioNTech for the Pfizer vaccine. “We had almost completed the contract signing with the German manufacturer at one point, but it has been delayed till now because China has interfered,” Tsai told a party meeting on Wednesday, in the most explicit comments to date, after months of suggestions that Beijing had been getting in the way of Taiwan’s procurement process. Pfizer-BioNTech reportedly has an exclusive deal with the Shanghai-based Fosun pharmaceuticals company to distribute the vaccine to the Greater China region, including Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan. Fosun has offered to supply Taiwan with vaccine doses, but Taiwan has said it is not possible. Beijing denies obstructing Taiwan’s deal with BioNtech and has accused Taiwan’s leaders of sacrificing the health of residents for politics. Taiwan’s opposition Kuomintang party has accused Tsai of bungling the vaccine rollout. “Taiwan access to vaccines continues to be slowed down by Chinese interference, while they insist we buy Chinese-made ones,” said Taiwan’s presidential spokeswoman, Kolas Yotaka. “If you really want to help, please don’t stand in the doorway, don’t block up the hall.” Read more here: Taiwan accuses China of interfering with Covid vaccine deals Professor Susan Michie has ben on Sky News. She is a clinical psychologist at UCL. She described the lack of action and feedback from the UK government on scientific advice as “demoralising” and said that yesterday Dominic Cummings presented a “depressing” picture. She said: As a scientist, spending a lot of my last year, along with many other colleagues, thinking about science, writing about science, providing scientific advice on top of our day jobs, it is quite depressing to think that all that work, and all the many reports that we’ve produced weren’t landing, and possibly weren’t being considered. She went on to say: I think one of the frustrations about having given scientific advice over this last year is that there isn’t feedback … whether it was rejected because it wasn’t thought to be good, or maybe there are other political priorities. One never really knows what the explanation is when the advice we give isn’t being implemented. And I think that’s a shame because I think it’s quite demoralising for scientists. She also made a value for money argument about scientific advice being sidelined, saying: “I think it’s important for the public to know how taxpayers money is being spent, because obviously there’s a substantial expense to serving a big scientific infrastructure.” Professor Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College London, whose modelling was instrumental in persuading the UK government to bring in the first lockdown, said scientists had become increasingly concerned in the week leading up to 13 March 2020 about the lack of a clear plan, and 20,000 to 30,000 lives could have been saved with earlier action. Asked on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme when the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), of which he was part, determined that a policy of pursuing herd immunity would lead to a vast number of deaths, he said a key meeting was held with the NHS on 1 March “which finalised estimates around health impacts, so the week after that really.” PA report Ferguson said he “wasn’t privy to what officials were thinking within government”, but added: “I would say from the scientific side there was increasing concern that week leading up to the 13 of March about the lack of clear, let’s say, (a) resolved plan of what would happen in the next few days in terms of implementing social distancing.” He said: “I think one of the biggest lessons to learn in such circumstances is we really need good surveillance within the country at a much earlier point than we actually had it back in March last year. As we saw the data build up, and it was matching the modelling, even worse than the modelling, let’s say it focused minds”. He then said locking down a week earlier would have saved 20,000 to 30,000 lives “and I think that’s unarguable. I mean the epidemic was doubling every three to four days in weeks 13th to 23rd of March, and so had we moved the interventions back a week we would have curtailed that and saved many lives”. Needless to say, lockdown sceptic Fraser Nelson, editor of the Spectator, is having none of it. From 8am this morning, all adults in Northern Ireland will be able to book a vaccination. Health Minister Robin Swann said: “I am delighted that our vaccination programme is now open to all adults in Northern Ireland. I know this will be very welcome news for young people who have been waiting patiently for their turn to get the jab.” You can check on the latest status of vaccination in all of the UK’s constituent countries here: NHS England NHS Scotland Gov.wales Northern Ireland As part of UK housing minister Robert Jenrick’s media round this morning, he is repeatedly trying to bat away accusations from former adviser Dominic Cummings by saying there will be a full inquiry in due course. This, in turn, is leading to him being pressed on the timing of that. He has roughly indicated “next spring”. The head of a Japanese doctors union on Thursday warned holding the Olympic Games in Tokyo this summer, with tens of thousands of people gathering from around the world, could lead to the development of a new “Olympic” strain of the coronavirus. With people from over 200 nations and territories set to arrive in Tokyo, it will be dangerous to host the Games in July, said Naoto Ueyama, head of the Japan Doctors Union. “All of the different mutant strains of the virus which exist in different places will be concentrated and gathering here in Tokyo. We cannot deny the possibility of even a new strain of the virus potentially emerging after the Olympics,” he told a news conference. “If such a situation were to arise, it could even mean a Tokyo Olympic strain of the virus being named in this way, which would be a huge tragedy and something which would be the target of criticism even for 100 years.” Japan pledged on Thursday to keep in close contact with Olympics stakeholders at home and abroad to ensure a safe and secure Games even as it prepared to extend a state of emergency across much of the nation, including host city Tokyo. Concerns remain rife about the safety of the 2020 Olympics, postponed for a year due to the coronavirus pandemic, with public opinion polls showing a majority of Japanese are opposed to holding the Games this summer amid struggles to control a fourth wave of the coronavirus and sluggish vaccine rollout. Elaine Lies reports for Reuters that the government is currently preparing to extend a state of emergency across much of the nation originally set to be lifted on 31 May, most likely well into June, officials have said - just weeks before the Games are set to open on 23 July. Earlier this week, the United States advised against travel to Japan, but Olympics organisers have said this will not affect the Games. The White House on Wednesday said it had been assured by the Japanese government that it will keep in close contact about concerns over the Olympics. Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato said Japan would continue making every effort to control the virus irrespective of the Olympics, and would be in close contact with concerned parties at home and abroad about the measures being taken in connection with the Games. “Careful anti-infection measures are a crucial part of being able to deliver a safe and secure event,” he told a news conference. “We will maintain close and periodic contact with all those concerned, both within the country and without, to explain what we’re doing on this score.” Robert Jenrick is the UK government minister out on media duties this morning – you can’t imagine he’s going to asked about anything else at all except Dominic Cummings. He’s just been on Sky News where he got quite an abrasive questioning and wasn’t exactly effusive in his defence of health secretary Matt Hancock. Asked if Hancock had lied repeatedly, as Cummings asserted yesterday, Jenrick fell back on standard lines about vaccine rollout and didn’t really address the question. He was pressed: “It’s no good you appearing on this programme if you are not prepared to answer questions, and with the greatest of respect, we’ve heard all about what the government’s doing with the rollout and we hear that every single day. But what people will take from your response to that first answer is you’re not prepared to back the health secretary. Why not?” Jenrick again responded with a fairly generic line, saying “I think that the department for health and the health secretary, have worked exceptionally hard over the course of this pandemic. This was an unprecedented situation, it was a national effort involving all parts of government, and all parts of the country. I think the public will appreciate, if you think back to the events of this time last year, how challenging it really was. Many things happen, of course they’ll be things which we could have done better and we’re learning those lessons as we go along. “The public inquiry will air that and hear the evidence in a reasoned and reflective manner. I think that is the right way to do that. But absolutely, I think the country responded phenomenally to the events of last year. My point was that we are still responding to the pandemic, and that has to be the focus of government right now.” You can watch it here: Alexander Britton at PA has had a quick whizz round the British newspapers to gauge their reactions to the testimony yesterday of former UK government adviser Dominic Cummings on the early days of handling the Covid pandemic. The Independent, i and Daily Mirror all use the same quote headline: “Tens of thousands died who didn’t need to die”, with the latter carrying a leader column headlined “damning testimony”. The paper points out the problem of only hearing one side of the story, but that the Government “failed in this fundamental duty”. It says: “Cummings’ evidence may have been one-sided and selective but it should not be ignored. His criticisms of the Government’s handling of Covid demand an explanation. “The coward Johnson is trying to hide from accountability by delaying the public inquiry into Covid until next spring. We need to learn lessons now, not at his convenience.” The Daily Telegraph takes a different angle, suggesting an element of revenge from Cummings with associate editor Camilla Tominey writing “having expended his nine lives in government, this was also about settling scores”. The Sun’s headline - “Do you need a hindsight test, Mr Cummings?” - pokes fun at his well-publicised trip to Barnard Castle during the pandemic, while its leader column claims Mr Johnson will “dodge Dom’s bombs”. It adds people “recognise that our Government was one of many whose Covid response was found wanting. “The key difference since being the stellar success of our world-leading vaccine rollout. Voters are more likely to credit the Government with that and our rosier future than rake over the terrible bleakness of 2020 and the chaos in Downing Street.” Melbourne’s newest major arts festival, Rising, has been thrown into turmoil the day after opening with the Victorian government announcing a seven-day statewide lockdown from Thursday night. The hotly anticipated winter arts festival opened on Wednesday after an extended wait, only to “hit pause” on Thursday as the city entered a “circuit-breaker” lockdown that closed indoor and outdoor entertainment and arts venues and prohibited public gatherings. The acting premier, James Merlino, announced the lockdown on Thursday morning to halt the spread of what he called a “highly infectious” Covid-19 variant, spreading “faster than ever recorded”. Rising was due to run until Sunday 6 June. At the time of writing, the lockdown was scheduled to run until Friday 4 June. In response to the public health directive, Rising cancelled all events from 5pm Thursday until 4 June and committed to issuing refunds for all tickets for that period. “A decision in relation to events scheduled between 4 June and 6 June will be made over the coming week,” a statement issued by the festival said. Rising had been initially scheduled for 2020 but was cancelled due to the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, which hit Melbourne particularly hard, sending the city into back-to-back lockdowns that extended from March until October, and into a third snap lockdown earlier this year. Read more of Stephanie Convery’s report here: Rising festival ‘hits pause’ the day after opening as Melbourne enters lockdown Good morning from London, it is Martin Belam here. I’ll be with you for the next few hours. We’ve just published this from Dr Deepti Gurdasani, who is a clinical epidemiologist and senior lecturer in machine learning at Queen Mary University of London: Amid the select committee revelations from Dominic Cummings, and in his recent claims on social media, there has been a lot of focus on suggestions that the UK government was following a “herd immunity” policy at the start of the pandemic, costing thousands of lives in the process. Of course, none of this is surprising. It is very clear that this was the flawed policy of the government through early March last year, not least because it was publicly discussed by the prime minister and by many scientific advisers to the government – including Patrick Vallance, who spoke of “enough people becoming immune to this” with mild illness, to help build herd immunity. The alternative strategy of high suppression or elimination of the virus was rejected by the government very early on, despite strong evidence from other countries around the world showing that this could be successfully applied. There were several elements that underpinned the devastating herd immunity strategy. It was believed that infection of large swathes of the population was inevitable, and acceptable, and that there was no way to prevent it. This came with the tacit acknowledgment that hundreds of thousands of deaths were acceptable, most of which would occur among vulnerable and elderly people. A sense of national exceptionalism held by some suggested that other countries’ experiences didn’t apply to us – despite that by March we had had months to observe and learn from countries in south Asia, and seeing the devastating impact of late action in Italy. Real-world evidence was ignored in favour of models and flawed thinking. The government’s strategy repeatedly conflated Covid-19 with flu, ignoring the much higher transmissibility, higher susceptibility, which would lead to many more people getting infected and dying, and unknown long-term impacts from a novel virus. Finally, there was the idea that the health of the economy needed to be balanced with public health. A lot of emphasis was placed on the disruption lockdowns would cause, with attempts to slow down such decisions, without understanding that delays would inevitably lead to even longer lockdowns and more economic damage. Read more here: Deepti Gurdasani – The UK government’s Covid strategy was discredited but we’re still paying the price This is Facebook’s statement on its change of policy: In light of ongoing investigations into the origin of Covid-19 and in consultation with public health experts, we will no longer remove the claim that COVID-19 is man-made or manufactured from our apps. We’re continuing to work with health experts to keep pace with the evolving nature of the pandemic and regularly update our policies as new facts and trends emerge. In February this year, the World Health Organization team that visited Wuhan to investigate the origins of the coronavirus pandemic all but dismissed a theory that the virus leaked from a laboratory. But their investigation was inconclusive as to what the origins of the theory actually were, and the theory that the virus was manufactured in a laboratory and escaped accidentally has again been raised in recent days as the United States and other countries call for a more in-depth investigation of the pandemic’s origins. Determining how the virus that causes Covid-19 began spreading is seen as vital to preventing future outbreaks. A long-delayed report by the team of international experts sent to Wuhan and their Chinese counterparts drew no firm conclusions as to the origins of the pandemic. Instead, they ranked a number of hypotheses according to how likely they believed they were. The report said the virus jumping from bats to humans via an intermediate animal was the most probable scenario, while it said a theory involving the virus leaking from a laboratory was “extremely unlikely”. After the report was released, however, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus insisted all theories remained on the table. On Wednesday, Joe Biden has ordered the US intelligence community to intensify its efforts to study the origins of coronavirus, adding that it will continue to press for China to participate in a full investigation. Biden’s request included asking the US intelligence community to explore the unlikely possibility that the origins of the virus trace to Chinese lab. After months of minimizing the possibility as a fringe theory, the Biden administration is responding both to domestic and geopolitical concerns about putting pressure on China to be transparent about the outbreak.. After months of minimizing the possibility as a fringe theory, the Biden administration is responding both to domestic and geopolitical concerns about putting pressure on China to be transparent about the outbreak. Hello and welcome to our ongoing live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. Facebook has lifted a ban on posts claiming that Covid-19 was “man-made” or “manufactured” in “In light of ongoing investigations into the origin of Covid and in consultation with public health experts”. Here are the other key recent developments: Johnson &amp; Johnson’s single-shot Covid vaccine is to be limited in Belgium to people aged 41 and over, authorities said following the death of a woman who received the jab. Switzerland is to re-open indoor restaurants and people will no longer be required to work from home, the government announced, saying it was lifting restrictions faster than previously planned. China accused the US of “spreading conspiracy theories and disinformation” after health chief Anthony Fauci said he was no longer convinced the coronavirus originated naturally – propelling the theory that it emerged from a Wuhan laboratory back into mainstream debate. The European Commission demanded an urgent court order requiring AstraZeneca to deliver millions more vaccines to the bloc or face a hefty fine, in a case that may reflect its anger more than its need for doses. Slovakia became the second EU country to authorise the use of the Russian-made Sputnik V Covid vaccine, which has not yet been approved by the bloc’s drug regulator. France will impose a compulsory quarantine on travellers arriving from the UK because of growing concerns over the spread of the Indian variant of the coronavirus, the government’s spokesman has said. Whistleblower protection groups urged the World Health Organization to launch an independent review into the case of an Italian researcher who reported being pressured to falsify data in a now-spiked WHO report into Italy’s coronavirus response. Perhaps conveniently for an incumbent candidate, Zambian president Edgar Lungu banned campaign rallies ahead of elections scheduled for 12 August, saying large gatherings risked spreading the Covid-19 virus. Vets in several parts of Russia reportedly started vaccinating cats against Covid-19. Russia in March said it had registered the world’s first coronavirus vaccine for animals. Only two animals in Russia, both cats, have so far tested positive for the virus.","charCount":"44998","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/yohannes-lowe\">Yohannes Lowe</a> (now), <a href=\"profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a> and <a href=\"profile/helen-sullivan\">Helen Sullivan</a> (earlier)"},{"headline":"Enya’s greatest songs – ranked!","standfirst":"<p>This month, the Irish singer turned 60 – but her popularity belies how radical her Celtic futurism really is</p>","trailText":"This month, the Irish singer turned 60 – but her popularity belies how radical her Celtic futurism really is","byline":"Luke Turner","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ef06b82692b4ddad8c789be7c365312194859115\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef06b82692b4ddad8c789be7c365312194859115/153_386_1969_1181/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Enya c. 1995\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Enya c. 1995.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sheila Rock/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<h2>20. Orinoco Flow (1988)</h2> <p>With the plinking, clipped synths and infernally moreish chorus, Orinoco Flow is the Enya song that everyone knows, yet it is arguably the least interesting moment on her breakthrough album, Watermark. Indeed, for years it seemed that its ubiquity obscured the stranger treasures in her discography.</p> <h2>19. March of the Celts (1987)</h2> <p>After Enya left family band <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/13/clannad-theme-from-harrys-game\">Clannad</a>, her solo career struggled until she got a chance to soundtrack the 1987 BBC TV series The Celts. March of the Celts showcases the oddness of Enya’s music. She’s not a solo artist, but actually a team, and producer Nicky Ryan’s roots were in sonic experimentation, such as designing a vibrating room so that deaf schoolchildren could sense music and dance.</p> <h2>18. Aldebaran (1987)</h2> <p>Aldebaran’s sparkling, synthetic harp and pipes are the backing for a text written by Enya lyricist Roma Ryan that tells of Celtic civilisation voyaging into space in hope of a better future – a concept that sits in curious musical parallel to<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/feb/14/dj-jackmaster-drexciya-techno-afrofuturism\"> Afrofuturist techno group Drexciya</a>’s vision of a Black nation living safe from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jan/25/drexciya-how-afrofuturism-inspired-calls-for-an-ocean-memorial-to-slavery\">persecution beneath the sea</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f6042a394040ec14ba2824a32cb79325425b72e2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f6042a394040ec14ba2824a32cb79325425b72e2/0_0_3001_2401/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Enya in 1997.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"800\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Enya in 1997.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>17. Miss Clare Remembers (1984)</h2> <p>Enya’s first solo release, as Eithne Ní Bhraonáin, was on a cassette compilation put out by the experimental label Touch Travel. A fascinating document of an artist finding her feet, this simple piano sketch would later reappear as a transportive instrumental on Watermark. At one point it featured 100 layered vocals, all eventually removed.</p> <h2>16. Aníron (2001)</h2> <p>Enya’s singular and timeless evocation of vast landscapes and Celtic-inspired otherworldliness made her the obvious candidate to contribute to the soundtracks of Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings films. Roma Ryan wrote the lyrics for Aníron in JRR Tolkien’s elvish dialect Sindarin, which in turn inspired her to develop Loxian, a fully realised language for Enya’s Celtic space travellers.</p> <h2>15. Deireadh an Tuath (1987)</h2> <p>Nicki Minaj spoke about her love of Enya on Stephen Colbert’s TV chatshow, saying: “It’s so peaceful, and it helps me with harmonies and sounds … I tap into my Enya.” Colbert made a trite comment about the singer being “like an elf”, and Minaj’s withering glance showed that her appreciation for Enya’s harmonisation, beautifully showcased in Deireadh an Tuath, marks her as a true believer.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLK6gnLsi_4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TLK6gnLsi_4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2>14. Shepherd Moons (1991)</h2> <p>The title track of Enya’s third album, the difficult follow-up to Watermark, is an understated, shimmering delight that brings to mind contemporary artists such as <a href=\"https://grouper.bandcamp.com/\">Grouper</a>. A perfect example of Nicky Ryan’s use of Enya’s voice as an instrument in the studio.</p> <h2>13. China Roses (1995)</h2> <p>A gorgeous, lilting song about finding your own heaven, wherever it may be. Enya’s involvement with spirituality is intriguing, her interviews on the subject elusive, and the nature of the music arguably makes it something of a blank canvas on to which those of various traditions can imprint their beliefs. I have it on good authority that she’s the choice for serious contemporary Wiccan rituals, as well as being used in Methodist church meditations.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/15/enya-dark-sky-island-album-feature\">Enya: ‘I feel comfortable singing in a variety of languages’</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>12. Only Time (2000)</h2> <p>Enya’s non-ironic influence on contemporary experimental electronic musicians such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/may/02/holly-herndon-on-her-musical-baby-spawn-i-wanted-to-find-a-new-sound\">Holly Herndon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gazelletwin.com/\">Gazelle Twin </a>is well-known, but the fan that surprises many is Chris Carter of Throbbing Gristle, who recently selected Only Time as a favourite track. If it’s good enough for a “wrecker of civilisation”, it should be good enough for you.</p> <h2>11. Sumiregusa (2005)</h2> <p>The natural world is a constant source of inspiration in Enya’s music. Sumiregusa, inspired by a Japanese haiku, is an ode to the wild violet. It’s a floaty track interrupted by a deeper bass boom – another pointer to Nicky Ryan’s experimental tendencies.</p> <h2>10. Smaoitím … (D’ Aodh Agus Do Mháire Uí Dhúgain) (1988)</h2> <p>Enya’s exploration of nature is never sentimental, and this affectingly sparse B-side to the jaunty Orinoco Flow is moving in its minimalism, her perfect voice singing of loss in the legend of a tidal wave sweeping ashore in her grandparents’ home of Maragallen, Ireland, and drowning the villagers as they prayed in church.</p> <h2>9. Watermark (1988)</h2> <p>The title track from Enya’s breakthrough LP, this delicate piano instrumental brings to mind Slowdive’s under-regarded 1995 album Pygmalion, highlighting how Enya can sit comfortably alongside supposedly more credible artists. I’ve even heard it mixed into Whitehouse’s Wriggle Like a Fucking Eel in a techno DJ set.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPCdsa7hS7M\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bPCdsa7hS7M?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2>8. How Can I Keep From Singing? (1991)</h2> <p>Given that Enya is an artist whose sound is built from digital processing and production, some would no doubt blow their tops were she described as a folk artist. Yet it was the Irish tradition that shaped her life and career, and this delicate version of an old hymn, first reworked by Pete Seeger in the 60s, suggests that an Enya folk covers album could be an intriguing prospect.</p> <h2>7. The Loxian Gate (2015)</h2> <p>This elegiac track of quasi-ceremonial rhythms and misty synths is another written in Roma Ryan’s Loxian language. The gates, according to Enya, guard the planet where the wandering intergalactic Celtic people will eventually find sanctuary, and this might be their quietly triumphant anthem.</p> <h2>6. Oíche Chiúin (Chorale) (2008)</h2> <p>Enya’s Christmas and winter albums are a mixed bag, but this Gaelic language Silent Night is a thing of beauty – and, in the multiple layering of Enya’s vocals to make her into “a choir of one”, is Nicky Ryan’s ultimate realisation of what the Enya project was intended to be.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9ac57df9a1c88210e7886bff63eaefb72b816788\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ac57df9a1c88210e7886bff63eaefb72b816788/0_0_3000_2015/1000.jpg\" alt=\"At the time of her biggest hit, Orinco Flow.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"672\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At the time of her biggest hit, Orinco Flow.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>5. Pax Deorum (1995)</h2> <p>This haunting track comes immediately after Anywhere Is, the infernally upbeat single from the album The Memory of Trees; it sounds all the better for the contrast. The surging synthesiser pulse is as ominous as the war horns of an ancient army approaching across a blasted moor.</p> <h2>4. I Could Never Say Goodbye (2015)</h2> <p>While Enya’s private life remains a closely guarded secret, she has always had a keen ear for heartbreak amid the high-concept themes sung in an invented language, paeans to nature and Celtic futurism. I Could Never Say Goodbye, her voice wobbling with regret, is a particularly fine example.</p> <h2>3. Cursum Perficio (1988)</h2> <p>This track was released the same year as the 4AD label put out <a href=\"https://classicalbumsundays.com/album-of-the-month-cocteau-twins-blue-bell-knoll/\">Cocteau Twins’ Blue Bell Knoll</a> and <a href=\"https://post-punk.com/dead-can-dance-the-serpents-egg/\">Dead Can Dance’s The Serpent’s Egg</a> to far greater critical acclaim, if not commercial success. Yet with stentorian rhythm and chanted Latin lyrics about Marilyn Monroe, Cursum Perficio makes the case that Enya ought to be regarded as the equal to these hip goth peers.</p> <h2>2. Even in the Shadows (2015)</h2> <p>If Enya has ever done a banger, it’s this – a gorgeous, rolling, sumptuous song, relying not on layers of her vocals, but a call-and-response with herself, building and building until it becomes ornate, euphoric pop. It comes from her most recent album, Dark Sky Island, a career high.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jl8iYAo90pE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Jl8iYAo90pE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2>1. Caribbean Blue (1991)</h2> <p>When Enya’s music is so much about texture and feeling, and when she has such a distinctive and singular sound, assigning a top-ranking tune is a difficult task. Caribbean Blue manages to hit the sweet spot between her songwriting and her more ambient work. A burbling, magical waltz, it is the Orinoco Flow for the true heads. I have once, in a state of discombobulation out on the north Kent marshes, listened to a loop of this track for at least an hour in what ended up a genuinely uncanny psychedelic experience.</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"2","wordcount":"1226","commentCloseDate":"2021-05-30T11:00:25Z","commentable":"true","displayHint":"immersive","firstPublicationDate":"2021-05-27T11:00:25Z","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2021-05-27T11:01:55Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2021-05-28T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"The Guardian","shortUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/p/hhavq","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef06b82692b4ddad8c789be7c365312194859115/153_386_1969_1181/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","isLive":"true","bodyText":"20.

March of the Celts (1987) After Enya left family band Clannad, her solo career struggled until she got a chance to soundtrack the 1987 BBC TV series The Celts. March of the Celts showcases the oddness of Enya’s music. She’s not a solo artist, but actually a team, and producer Nicky Ryan’s roots were in sonic experimentation, such as designing a vibrating room so that deaf schoolchildren could sense music and dance. 18. Aldebaran (1987) Aldebaran’s sparkling, synthetic harp and pipes are the backing for a text written by Enya lyricist Roma Ryan that tells of Celtic civilisation voyaging into space in hope of a better future – a concept that sits in curious musical parallel to Afrofuturist techno group Drexciya’s vision of a Black nation living safe from persecution beneath the sea. 17. Miss Clare Remembers (1984) Enya’s first solo release, as Eithne Ní Bhraonáin, was on a cassette compilation put out by the experimental label Touch Travel. A fascinating document of an artist finding her feet, this simple piano sketch would later reappear as a transportive instrumental on Watermark. At one point it featured 100 layered vocals, all eventually removed. 16. Aníron (2001) Enya’s singular and timeless evocation of vast landscapes and Celtic-inspired otherworldliness made her the obvious candidate to contribute to the soundtracks of Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings films. Roma Ryan wrote the lyrics for Aníron in JRR Tolkien’s elvish dialect Sindarin, which in turn inspired her to develop Loxian, a fully realised language for Enya’s Celtic space travellers. 15. Deireadh an Tuath (1987) Nicki Minaj spoke about her love of Enya on Stephen Colbert’s TV chatshow, saying: “It’s so peaceful, and it helps me with harmonies and sounds … I tap into my Enya.” Colbert made a trite comment about the singer being “like an elf”, and Minaj’s withering glance showed that her appreciation for Enya’s harmonisation, beautifully showcased in Deireadh an Tuath, marks her as a true believer. 14. Shepherd Moons (1991) The title track of Enya’s third album, the difficult follow-up to Watermark, is an understated, shimmering delight that brings to mind contemporary artists such as Grouper. A perfect example of Nicky Ryan’s use of Enya’s voice as an instrument in the studio. 13. China Roses (1995) A gorgeous, lilting song about finding your own heaven, wherever it may be. Enya’s involvement with spirituality is intriguing, her interviews on the subject elusive, and the nature of the music arguably makes it something of a blank canvas on to which those of various traditions can imprint their beliefs. I have it on good authority that she’s the choice for serious contemporary Wiccan rituals, as well as being used in Methodist church meditations. 12. Only Time (2000) Enya’s non-ironic influence on contemporary experimental electronic musicians such as Holly Herndon and Gazelle Twin is well-known, but the fan that surprises many is Chris Carter of Throbbing Gristle, who recently selected Only Time as a favourite track. If it’s good enough for a “wrecker of civilisation”, it should be good enough for you. 11. Sumiregusa (2005) The natural world is a constant source of inspiration in Enya’s music. Sumiregusa, inspired by a Japanese haiku, is an ode to the wild violet. It’s a floaty track interrupted by a deeper bass boom – another pointer to Nicky Ryan’s experimental tendencies. 10. Smaoitím … (D’ Aodh Agus Do Mháire Uí Dhúgain) (1988) Enya’s exploration of nature is never sentimental, and this affectingly sparse B-side to the jaunty Orinoco Flow is moving in its minimalism, her perfect voice singing of loss in the legend of a tidal wave sweeping ashore in her grandparents’ home of Maragallen, Ireland, and drowning the villagers as they prayed in church. 9. Watermark (1988) The title track from Enya’s breakthrough LP, this delicate piano instrumental brings to mind Slowdive’s under-regarded 1995 album Pygmalion, highlighting how Enya can sit comfortably alongside supposedly more credible artists. I’ve even heard it mixed into Whitehouse’s Wriggle Like a Fucking Eel in a techno DJ set. 8. How Can I Keep From Singing? (1991) Given that Enya is an artist whose sound is built from digital processing and production, some would no doubt blow their tops were she described as a folk artist. Yet it was the Irish tradition that shaped her life and career, and this delicate version of an old hymn, first reworked by Pete Seeger in the 60s, suggests that an Enya folk covers album could be an intriguing prospect. 7. The Loxian Gate (2015) This elegiac track of quasi-ceremonial rhythms and misty synths is another written in Roma Ryan’s Loxian language. The gates, according to Enya, guard the planet where the wandering intergalactic Celtic people will eventually find sanctuary, and this might be their quietly triumphant anthem. 6. Oíche Chiúin (Chorale) (2008) Enya’s Christmas and winter albums are a mixed bag, but this Gaelic language Silent Night is a thing of beauty – and, in the multiple layering of Enya’s vocals to make her into “a choir of one”, is Nicky Ryan’s ultimate realisation of what the Enya project was intended to be. 5. Pax Deorum (1995) This haunting track comes immediately after Anywhere Is, the infernally upbeat single from the album The Memory of Trees; it sounds all the better for the contrast. The surging synthesiser pulse is as ominous as the war horns of an ancient army approaching across a blasted moor. 4. I Could Never Say Goodbye (2015) While Enya’s private life remains a closely guarded secret, she has always had a keen ear for heartbreak amid the high-concept themes sung in an invented language, paeans to nature and Celtic futurism. I Could Never Say Goodbye, her voice wobbling with regret, is a particularly fine example. 3. Cursum Perficio (1988) This track was released the same year as the 4AD label put out Cocteau Twins’ Blue Bell Knoll and Dead Can Dance’s The Serpent’s Egg to far greater critical acclaim, if not commercial success. Yet with stentorian rhythm and chanted Latin lyrics about Marilyn Monroe, Cursum Perficio makes the case that Enya ought to be regarded as the equal to these hip goth peers. 2. Even in the Shadows (2015) If Enya has ever done a banger, it’s this – a gorgeous, rolling, sumptuous song, relying not on layers of her vocals, but a call-and-response with herself, building and building until it becomes ornate, euphoric pop. It comes from her most recent album, Dark Sky Island, a career high. 1. Caribbean Blue (1991) When Enya’s music is so much about texture and feeling, and when she has such a distinctive and singular sound, assigning a top-ranking tune is a difficult task. Caribbean Blue manages to hit the sweet spot between her songwriting and her more ambient work. A burbling, magical waltz, it is the Orinoco Flow for the true heads. I have once, in a state of discombobulation out on the north Kent marshes, listened to a loop of this track for at least an hour in what ended up a genuinely uncanny psychedelic experience.","charCount":"7382","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"true","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/luke-turner\">Luke Turner</a>"},{"headline":"Tesco admits labour abuses found in India garment supply chain","standfirst":"<p>Supermarket is among global brands named in new report uncovering workers’ rights abuses in Tamil Nadu’s garment sector</p>","trailText":"Supermarket is among global brands named in new report uncovering workers’ rights abuses in Tamil Nadu’s garment sector","byline":"Sarah Johnson","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b5c292ca25bd44dcf897f1e2c65e2dde4e737e53\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b5c292ca25bd44dcf897f1e2c65e2dde4e737e53/0_0_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"a Tesco Express in central London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tesco has said it is working with the report’s authors and other brands to stamp out abusive practices in the region.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tolga Akmen/AFP/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Tesco says it has found labour abuses in its garment supply chain in southern India after receiving evidence of widespread forced labour of migrant women in cotton spinning-mills across Tamil Nadu.</p> <p>The supermarket chain admitted there were several “critical issues” in relation to wages and benefits and verbal intimidation of workers in one of the mills it has links to in the region, and is working to stamp out abusive practices.</p> <p>An investigation by NGOs Somo and Arisa, which interviewed 725 workers at 29 cotton-spinning mills in Tamil Nadu found evidence of multiple labour abuses including deception, intimidation and threats towards vulnerable female workers, abusive working and living conditions and excessive overtime.</p> <p>A Tesco spokesperson said: “We take allegations of human rights abuses in our supply chain extremely seriously … While not a direct customer of this mill, we recognise our responsibility to everyone in our supply chain and are working alongside other brands and with Somo to investigate and ensure improvements are made.”</p> <p>One of the workers spoken to by the researchers said: “We do not get proper sleep.

There is heightened urgency to act quickly so that crucial protections can be in place when the once-per-decade redistricting process gets under way later this year.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/29/fight-to-vote-newsletter-filibuster-senate-showdown-democrats\">Why a filibuster showdown in the US Senate is unavoidable</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“There is a ticking timebomb,” said Wendy Weiser, the director of the democracy program at the Brennan Center for Justice, which supports the bill. “It will be a significant failure if [Congress] doesn’t pass these two pieces of major voting legislation. It will be a significant failure for the country, for the American people … I don’t think Joe Manchin wants that on himself.”</p> <p>Manchin is concerned the bill still does not have enough Republican buy-in, and favors an alternative piece of legislation that would reauthorize the Voting Rights Act and require election changes to be pre-approved by the federal government. Some observers say that solely passing that bill, named the John R Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, would be inadequate to undo the suppressive laws that have gone into effect and that trying to get bipartisan support for the measure is a fool’s errand, given the Republican party’s embrace of Trump’s lies about the 2020 election. Senator Mitch McConnell has also taken a personal interest in trying to sink the bill, saying it would be devastating to Republicans, McClatchy <a href=\"https://www.kentucky.com/news/politics-government/article251179289.html\">reported earlier this month</a>.</p> <p>The West Virginia senator’s concern highlights an even bigger question looming over the Democratic party – how to pass any priority legislation with only, at best, 51 votes in the Senate. Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, has set August as a deadline for passing a voting rights bill – a deadline the White House has embraced.</p> <p>Schumer has repeatedly said “failure is not an option”. But absent a shift on eliminating the filibuster, a procedural rule in the Senate that requires 60 votes to advance legislation, failure seems to be the most likely option, the Washington Post <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/voting-rights-for-the-people/2021/05/16/bb65909a-b458-11eb-ab43-bebddc5a0f65_story.html\">reported</a>. Senator Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, another Democrat who does not support eliminating the filibuster<strong>,</strong> bluntly asked the caucus what the plan on the legislation was <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2021/05/13/kyrsten-sinema-democrats-voting-rights-488148\">earlier this month</a>.</p> <p>“The goal of the authors is to get it signed into law.

Now, though, some Democrats think that showdown may come over a vote on a 6 January commission to investigate the mob attack on the Capitol. In both cases Democrats don’t seem to have the votes to overcome a filibuster which would spur a showdown.</p> <p>“Part of what I’ve heard is let’s not race to abolish or even reform the filibuster rule because frankly there hasn’t been a ‘casualty on the floor of the Senate’,” said Senator Alex Padilla of California, a former top elections official in his home state. “There’s no bill this session that has died because of the filibuster rule. So what might it be that breaks the filibuster’s back? Is it the infrastructure package? Is it the voting rights bill? Is it a climate change bill?”</p> <p>Manchin’s comments are being closely watched because Democrats cannot afford to lose his vote – or that of any other senator – since they control only 50 seats in the Senate. Manchin has said he does not favor getting rid of the filibuster.</p> <p>But outside groups supporting the For the People Act say they are unfazed by Manchin’s recalcitrance. They remain optimistic that he will eventually come around to support it.</p> <p>“Reports of the bill’s death are very premature. It is still the priority for Democrats in Congress,” Weiser said.</p> <p>“We remain optimistic about the path forward for this bill,” said Tiffany Muller, the executive director of End Citizens United/Let America Vote, which is backing a $30m effort to support the bill.</p> <p>Manchin has pointed to a reauthorization of preclearance requirements as a better way to protect voting rights than a sweeping voting bill. Last week, he released a letter with the Republican senator Lisa Murkowski calling on Congress to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act, including the preclearance provision gutted by the US supreme court in 2013. “Inaction is not an option,” they wrote.</p> <p>That letter was a “glimmer of hope”, said Padilla.</p> <p>“All the more reason to continue to make the case not just in Senate chambers but in the court of public opinion across the country,” he added, stressing that Democratic efforts to engage in genuine debate would address Manchin’s concern that a real attempt at bipartisanship should be made.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b08355c860ecc96a6bf73576e93ac61f4fc24575\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b08355c860ecc96a6bf73576e93ac61f4fc24575/0_29_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A participant in the National John Lewis Day of Action and Votercade awaits the start of the event to demand the passage of the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act in Selma, Alabama, on 8 May.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A participant in the National John Lewis Day of Action and Votercade awaits the start of the event to demand the passage of the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act in Selma, Alabama, on 8 May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sue Dorfman/Zuma Wire/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Voting groups say it would be a mistake to only pass a voting rights reauthorization. While current proposals would only require certain places with documented evidence of voting discrimination to be subject to preclearance, Manchin told ABC he thinks every state should have to get its voting changes preapproved. Republicans are unlikely to support such an idea. “That’s just not actually in the cards,” Weiser said.</p> <p>“It’s a false choice. It has to be both,” said Stephen Spaulding, senior counsel for public policy and government affairs at Common Cause, a government watchdog group. “They’re both critically important pieces of legislation and it’s a false choice to say I’m for the other and not for this. Because only together will we fully rebalance the state of voting in America to favor access.”</p> <p>Four House Democrats sent a letter to colleagues last week making a similar argument. </p> <p>Advocates are heartened by polling that shows the measure is extremely popular and the fact that Democrats have held together so far and brought the bill to the verge of a Senate floor vote despite some grumbling from their own caucus.</p> <p>“What you’re seeing is a commitment to a floor vote and getting people on record,” Spaulding said.</p> <p>If Democrats went into the 2022 midterms without doing anything to protect voting rights, it would be disastrous, advocates said.</p> <p>“Voters showed up in record numbers to choose new leadership. There were commitments made across multiple Congresses on both bills and so saying ‘we tried’ isn’t going to work,” Spaulding said.</p> <p>“If these bills weren’t to go to President Biden’s desk, they’d have … to articulate why they did nothing when they had the power to do so.”</p>","wordcount":"1271","firstPublicationDate":"2021-05-27T11:00:25Z","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2021-05-27T11:01:55Z","productionOffice":"US","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/p/hh9ba","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/85b1a559fb5d52b9efe430f32669ff5d38688b73/0_48_3500_2101/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","isLive":"true","bodyText":"After six months of aggressive Republican efforts to restrict voting access, Democrats are facing new questions about how they will actually pass voting rights reforms through Congress.

There is heightened urgency to act quickly so that crucial protections can be in place when the once-per-decade redistricting process gets under way later this year. “There is a ticking timebomb,” said Wendy Weiser, the director of the democracy program at the Brennan Center for Justice, which supports the bill. “It will be a significant failure if [Congress] doesn’t pass these two pieces of major voting legislation. It will be a significant failure for the country, for the American people … I don’t think Joe Manchin wants that on himself.” Manchin is concerned the bill still does not have enough Republican buy-in, and favors an alternative piece of legislation that would reauthorize the Voting Rights Act and require election changes to be pre-approved by the federal government. Some observers say that solely passing that bill, named the John R Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, would be inadequate to undo the suppressive laws that have gone into effect and that trying to get bipartisan support for the measure is a fool’s errand, given the Republican party’s embrace of Trump’s lies about the 2020 election. Senator Mitch McConnell has also taken a personal interest in trying to sink the bill, saying it would be devastating to Republicans, McClatchy reported earlier this month. The West Virginia senator’s concern highlights an even bigger question looming over the Democratic party – how to pass any priority legislation with only, at best, 51 votes in the Senate. Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, has set August as a deadline for passing a voting rights bill – a deadline the White House has embraced. Schumer has repeatedly said “failure is not an option”. But absent a shift on eliminating the filibuster, a procedural rule in the Senate that requires 60 votes to advance legislation, failure seems to be the most likely option, the Washington Post reported. Senator Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, another Democrat who does not support eliminating the filibuster, bluntly asked the caucus what the plan on the legislation was earlier this month. “The goal of the authors is to get it signed into law. I don’t see a path,” one Democratic senator vented to Politico. In the past few months it seemed like a showdown over the filibuster would come on a voting rights bill. Now, though, some Democrats think that showdown may come over a vote on a 6 January commission to investigate the mob attack on the Capitol. In both cases Democrats don’t seem to have the votes to overcome a filibuster which would spur a showdown. “Part of what I’ve heard is let’s not race to abolish or even reform the filibuster rule because frankly there hasn’t been a ‘casualty on the floor of the Senate’,” said Senator Alex Padilla of California, a former top elections official in his home state. “There’s no bill this session that has died because of the filibuster rule. So what might it be that breaks the filibuster’s back? Is it the infrastructure package? Is it the voting rights bill? Is it a climate change bill?” Manchin’s comments are being closely watched because Democrats cannot afford to lose his vote – or that of any other senator – since they control only 50 seats in the Senate. Manchin has said he does not favor getting rid of the filibuster. But outside groups supporting the For the People Act say they are unfazed by Manchin’s recalcitrance. They remain optimistic that he will eventually come around to support it. “Reports of the bill’s death are very premature. It is still the priority for Democrats in Congress,” Weiser said. “We remain optimistic about the path forward for this bill,” said Tiffany Muller, the executive director of End Citizens United/Let America Vote, which is backing a $30m effort to support the bill. Manchin has pointed to a reauthorization of preclearance requirements as a better way to protect voting rights than a sweeping voting bill. Last week, he released a letter with the Republican senator Lisa Murkowski calling on Congress to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act, including the preclearance provision gutted by the US supreme court in 2013. “Inaction is not an option,” they wrote. That letter was a “glimmer of hope”, said Padilla. “All the more reason to continue to make the case not just in Senate chambers but in the court of public opinion across the country,” he added, stressing that Democratic efforts to engage in genuine debate would address Manchin’s concern that a real attempt at bipartisanship should be made. Voting groups say it would be a mistake to only pass a voting rights reauthorization. While current proposals would only require certain places with documented evidence of voting discrimination to be subject to preclearance, Manchin told ABC he thinks every state should have to get its voting changes preapproved. Republicans are unlikely to support such an idea. “That’s just not actually in the cards,” Weiser said. “It’s a false choice. It has to be both,” said Stephen Spaulding, senior counsel for public policy and government affairs at Common Cause, a government watchdog group. “They’re both critically important pieces of legislation and it’s a false choice to say I’m for the other and not for this. Because only together will we fully rebalance the state of voting in America to favor access.” Four House Democrats sent a letter to colleagues last week making a similar argument. Advocates are heartened by polling that shows the measure is extremely popular and the fact that Democrats have held together so far and brought the bill to the verge of a Senate floor vote despite some grumbling from their own caucus. “What you’re seeing is a commitment to a floor vote and getting people on record,” Spaulding said. If Democrats went into the 2022 midterms without doing anything to protect voting rights, it would be disastrous, advocates said. “Voters showed up in record numbers to choose new leadership. There were commitments made across multiple Congresses on both bills and so saying ‘we tried’ isn’t going to work,” Spaulding said. “If these bills weren’t to go to President Biden’s desk, they’d have … to articulate why they did nothing when they had the power to do so.”","charCount":"7727","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/sam-levine\">Sam Levine</a> in New York and <a href=\"profile/daniel-strauss\">Daniel Strauss</a> in Washington"},{"headline":"Airbus lifts jet production plans as ‘aviation recovery begins’ – business live","standfirst":"<p>Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial news</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2021/may/27/airbus-a320-production-aviation-recovery-pandemic-markets-ftse-us-jobs-gdp-rates-business-live?page=with:block-60af6a168f086d71cc15c2f7#block-60af6a168f086d71cc15c2f7\">Latest: UK online vacancies rise, as furlough total falls</a></li><li>Restaurant booking surge as indoor dining resumes</li></ul><p>Earlier:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2021/may/27/airbus-a320-production-aviation-recovery-pandemic-markets-ftse-us-jobs-gdp-rates-business-live?page=with:block-60af33ad8f088d8c3178a794#block-60af33ad8f088d8c3178a794\">Airbus tells suppliers to prepare for higher A320 output</a></li><li>Plans to lift A320 production to 64/month by 2023, from 40/month now<br></li><li>Airbus CEO: Aviation sector is beginning to recover<br></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2021/may/27/airbus-a320-production-aviation-recovery-pandemic-markets-ftse-us-jobs-gdp-rates-business-live?page=with:block-60af51858f086d71cc15c192#block-60af51858f086d71cc15c192\">Signals growing signs of recovery</a></li></ul>","trailText":"Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial news","byline":"Graeme Wearden","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9b56980770d6e3d78bd9d51094a509d8d6e8e319\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b56980770d6e3d78bd9d51094a509d8d6e8e319/0_0_5138_3082/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An Air France Airbus A320.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An Air France Airbus A320.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Filip Singer/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<div id=\"block-60af7ad28f088d8c3178ab68\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/jasper-jolly\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-05-27T10:57:43.392Z\">11.57am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Full story: Airbus tells suppliers to gear up for record production on bestselling jets</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Airbus has told suppliers it is planning for record production of its bestselling planes within two years in a sign of the manufacturer’s hopes for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/29/airlines-may-not-recover-from-covid-19-crisis-for-five-years-says-airbus\">belated but strong recovery for aviation from the coronavirus pandemic</a>.</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2021/may/27/airbus-a320-production-aviation-recovery-pandemic-markets-ftse-us-jobs-gdp-rates-business-live?page=with:block-60af33ad8f088d8c3178a794#block-60af33ad8f088d8c3178a794\">The European manufacturer said on Thursday</a> it would increase production of A320 single-aisle aircraft to 45 per month by October, up from 40.</p> <p>However, it said suppliers should be ready for a rate of 64 per month by the spring of 2023 for the A320, which is well suited to short-haul travel that is expected to bounce back the quickest.

The European manufacturer said on Thursday it would increase production of A320 single-aisle aircraft to 45 per month by October, up from 40. However, it said suppliers should be ready for a rate of 64 per month by the spring of 2023 for the A320, which is well suited to short-haul travel that is expected to bounce back the quickest. That would beat its previous highest rate target of 63, and would be followed by 70 per month at the start of 2024 and as high as 75 by 2025. The aerospace industry has endured months of weak demand for planes during the pandemic as airline customers cut back on orders as their revenues dried up. Airbus and its US rival, Boeing, together cut tens of thousands of jobs worldwide as demand plummeted. Demand for Boeing planes was hit further by the crisis over its previously top-selling 737 Max, which was grounded for over a year after two fatal crashes caused by malfunctions. There is still confusion over when people across the world will be allowed to travel for tourism purposes. Airline and holiday firm bosses on Wednesday attacked the UK government’s “utterly confusing” advice on foreign travel. However, aerospace analysts have long expected demand for air travel – alongside the sector’s carbon emissions – to overtake pre-pandemic levels rapidly once vaccines start to diminish the risks of the coronavirus. In the long term, the growth of the middle class in Asia and Africa is expected to continue the structural growth in flight number. Here’s the full story: Here’s more reaction to Airbus’s plan to boost aircraft production, particularly for its A320 jet. The BBC points out that Airbus’s plans could benefit Northern Ireland: Airbus has said it envisages producing 14 of its A220 airliners every month within the next five years. The wings for the A220 are made at the Spirit AeroSystems plant in Belfast. The current monthly production rate is five, which Airbus has said will increase to six early next year. Boris Johnson has been warned by business leaders that a fresh package of economic support would be required if rising Covid-19 infections prevent the further relaxation of pandemic restrictions next month, my colleague Richard Partington explains. After the reopening of hospitality venues indoors across all four nations of the UK, the Guardian’s latest monthly assessment of economic developments suggests the country is on course for a short-term growth boom this summer. Retail sales have surged above pre-pandemic levels, while customers returning to restaurants, pubs and cafes have driven a sharp rise in consumer spending to begin repairing the damage from the worst recession in 300 years. However, concerns are mounting over the Covid variant first detected in India – B.1.617.2 – and the possibility that rising infections could delay the next phase of the government’s roadmap for relaxing controls in England. Here’s the full story: Here’s Reuters’s take on the jump in restaurant booking last week: British diners flocked to restaurants over the past week after lockdown restrictions lifted across most of the United Kingdom, and the number of furloughed workers fell to its lowest since the start of the year, weekly official data showed. The figures add to signs that economic life is returning to normal as lockdown restrictions ease following the roll-out of COVID vaccines which now cover more than 70% of the adult population. Britain’s government closed pubs, restaurants and non-essential retailers at the start of the year due to the spread of a more infectious variant of COVID, and significant reopening only started in late April. Restaurants in England, Scotland and Wales were allowed to serve customers indoors from May 17, after several weeks when outdoor dining was allowed. Bookings in the first full week of opening, ending May 24, were 32% above their level in the same period of 2019, before the pandemic, according to data from booking website OpenTable produced for the Office for National Statistics. This chart shows how UK online job adverts have now risen to 18% above their pre-pandemic level. It highlights how firms are look to hire more staff to handle rising demand - particularly in transport and logistics, and construction. But, as Adzuna point out, graduate job opportunities are lagging behind: The proportion of workers on furlough has fallen to its lowest level this year, as the UK economy emerges from lockdown. New figures from the ONS shows that 8% of the workforce were furloughed in the two weeks to May 16, the lowest total seen so far in 2021. That equates to around 2.2m, and is down from 10% around the start of the month. The report also shows a surge in people returning to restaurants since indoor dining was allowed again last week. Restaurant bookings in the week to Monday May 24th were 32% higher than their level two years earlier, as people took the opportunity to eat out indoors again. Firms are also posting more online job adverts - a sign that the economy is picking up as restrictions are relaxed. Online job adverts on 21 May 2021 were 18% higher than the average in February 2020 - an increase of 4 percentage points on last week, according to data from Adzuna. The largest weekly increase was for “transport, logistics and warehouse” jobs, which surged 21 percentage points to 275% of its February 2020 average level -- the highest level since the series began in February 2018. Manufacturers also posted more job adverts - up 14 percentage points week-on-week, to 231% of its February 2020 average level. But “catering and hospitality” saw a small dip, down 2 percentage points on last week, to around 113% of its February 2020 average. The ONS adds: This follows a recent upward trend for this category, having risen by 55 percentage points since 9 April 2021, just before the first easing of hospitality restrictions when pubs and restaurants reopened in England. Top US and Chinese trade negotiators held “candid” talks today, their first under the Biden presidency, as Washington continues to raise concerns over Beijing’s trade practices. In the long-awaited first official engagement between the US trade representative Katherine Tai and the Chinese vice-premier, Liu He, held virtually on Thursday morning Beijing time, the two sides emphasised the importance of the bilateral trade relations and agreed to further negotiations. A statement from China’s commerce ministry said the US and China held “candid, pragmatic and constructive exchanges with an attitude of equality and mutual respect”. In Washington, the office of the US trade representative said that Tai “discussed the guiding principles of the Biden-Harris administration’s worker-centred trade policy and her ongoing review of the US-China trade relationship, while also raising issues of concern.” Here’s the full story: The pandemic has hit profits at the publisher of the Daily Mail, although its investment in online car retailer Cazoo is more than cushioning the blow. Pre-tax profits at Daily Mail and General Trust fell 45% in the six months to the end of March to £42m, down from £77m a year earlier. Revenues dropped to £547m, from £642m. While its business-to-business information service grew revenues and profits, its events and exhibitions arm suffered a 95% drop in revenues amid the lockdown. The consumer media businesses (which includes the Daily Mail, Mailonline, Metro and the ‘i’) saw revenues drop 10% amid a volatile advertising market. DMGT’s 20% stake in used car seller Cazoo - which is floating in New York - is valued at $1.35bn, or around £957m. That means an eight-fold return on DMGT’s total investment of £117m, after it invested another £34m in Cazoo last October. CEO Paul Zwillenberg said: Our financial flexibility enabled us to continue to invest in Cazoo through multiple funding rounds. Despite the near-term economic uncertainty, we had conviction in its opportunity to transform the used car market. Cazoo continues to go from strength to strength and its proposed SPAC combination on the New York Stock Exchange would value our stake at US$1.35bn, a return of eight times on our capital. Shares in DMGT are up 3.3% this morning. Rolls-Royce, the jet engine maker, is leading the FTSE 100 risers this morning - up 3% - as Airbus’s announcement lifts the sector. Warren East, Rolls-Royce’s CEO, told Radio 4’s Today Programme that predicting the precise timing of the recovery was very difficult. East also points out that Covid-19 will have a permanent impact on the sector: The pandemic will undoubtedly change certain behaviours, and that’s reflected in our expectation of a smaller market in future than we would have expected pre-Covid. But we absolutely expect continued growth, because aviation is such an important part of the world economy. East was speaking as Rolls-Royce opened its new £90m engine testbed at its Derby factory. The largest in the world (bigger than a football pitch, apparently), it will test new engines before they’re put into service. While the pandemic has hit air travel, it has also created a boom in pet ownership. UK retailer Pets at Home has achieved sales of more than £1bn for the first time, as more people have turned to furry, feathered and scaled friends in the lockdown. My colleague Jasper Jolly explains: The retailer and vet chain estimated that pet numbers increased by 8% during a year in which many people were stuck at home. The boom has led to pet food shortages. The pandemic “structurally altered the dynamics of the UK pet care market”, the company said, with increased home working removing a barrier to pet ownership and increasing the emotional attachment to – and willingness to spend on – animals. Pets at Home revenues grew by 7.9% to £1.1bn in the year to 25 March, which coincided almost exactly with the start of the UK’s lockdowns. That was a record in the company’s 30-year history. It said there had been a pet “baby boom”. Sales of kitten and puppy products surged by 37% and 26% respectively, with training products and heated puppy beds in particular demand. Even less cuddly fish tank sales increased. The global rollout of Covid-19 vaccines is lifting future demand for travel, as economies reopen and tourism picks up. So aircraft bosses need to take decisions now if they want suppliers to be ready for higher output in future. The FT’s Sylvia Pfeifer explains: The outlook for a longer-term recovery in aviation has improved with the global rollout of vaccines despite regional flare-ups. One of the biggest challenges for the industry is ensuring that its long, intricate supply chains are ready to ramp up production to meet the expected demand. Reuters says Airbus has laid out ‘sweeping goals’ to expand production of its A320 jetliners over the next few years (initially from 40 per month today to 45 by the end of the year, and 64 per month by Q2 2023). Demand for single-aisle jets is recovering as domestic travel rebounds, especially in the United States and China. In anticipation of a continued recovery in that market, Airbus is asking its suppliers to “enable a scenario” where it can produce 70 single-aisle jets a month by the first quarter of 2024. “Longer term, Airbus is investigating opportunities for rates as high as 75 (a month) by 2025,” it said. Analysts at Jefferies described the move by Boeing’s main rival as “punchy production plans”. Airbus is telling suppliers to prepare for an ‘aggressive ramp up’ of jet production, explains Richard Schuurman, aviation reporter for Air Insight. Airbus has boosted optimism for a global aviation recovery by alerting its suppliers prepare for a sharp increase in A320 production, says Bloomberg: Airbus SE is preparing to gear up production of its best-selling A320-series jets beyond pre-pandemic levels within two years, lending a jolt of optimism for a recovery in global aviation. The shares jumped after the world’s largest producer of commercial jetliners told suppliers to be ready to raise output of its top-selling narrow-body to a rate of 64 per month by the second quarter of 2023. That figure could rise to 70 a month early the following year and could reach 75 by 2025, Airbus said in a statement Thursday. The ambitious plan stands out in an industry that’s still struggling to gain traction after the Covid-19 pandemic wiped out demand for air travel. Despite short-term flareups in the outbreak, the longer-term picture has brightened with the global rollout of vaccines. Airbus and its U.S. rival Boeing Co. have been showing more confidence even as pressure to lower emissions presents the next challenge for the industry. Shares in Airbus have jumped around 6% in early trading in Paris, as investors welcome its plans to boost production output over the next few years. They’re currently up €5.7 at €103.4, close to April’s one-year high. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After seeing demand battered by the pandemic, aerospace manufacturer Airbus says the recovery is beginning. It’s alerted its suppliers to prepare for a steep acceleration in production of its popular A320 single-aisle passenger jets, as it sets target above pre-pandemic levels in two years time. The European aerospace group has confirmed plans to increase A320 output to 45 jets per month in the last quarter of this year, from 40 at present. It has also set suppliers a new target -- 64 a month by the second quarter of 2023, and wants to ensure it has the long term capacity in place. That’s above the 60/month peak it hit in 2019, before Covid-19. Airbus says it expect the commercial aircraft market to recover to pre-COVID levels between 2023 and 2025, led by the single-aisle segment. Guillaume Faury, Airbus CEO, says this morning: “The aviation sector is beginning to recover from the COVID-19 crisis” Looking further ahead, Airbus is anticipating a “continued recovering market”. It also asking suppliers to “ enable a scenario” for production to expand further to 70 by the first quarter of 2024. And long term, it’s also investigating whether it could boost production to 75 by 2025. This steep ramp up looks like a sign of confidence in the recovery of the aviation industry from the pandemic - with Covid-19 vaccinations enabling a pick-up in international tourism. Faury says Airbus wants its suppliers to be ready for the pick-up in demand. “The message to our supplier community provides visibility to the entire industrial ecosystem to secure the necessary capabilities and be ready when market conditions call for it. In parallel, we are transforming our industrial system by optimising our aerostructures set-up and modernising our A320 Family production facilities. All these actions are set in motion to prepare our future.” Airbus is also slightly increasing its production goals for its small A220 jet, and the wide-body A350 - again, in a mix of provisional goals and firm plans. A220 Family: Currently at around rate five aircraft per month from Mirabel and Mobile, the rate is confirmed to rise to around six in early 2022. Airbus is also envisaging a monthly production rate of 14 by the middle of the decade. A350 Family: Currently at an average production rate of five per month, this is expected to increase to six by autumn 2022. A330 Family: Production remains at an average monthly production rate of two per month. Also coming up today Big Oil is reeling from a series of blows yesterday, over their failure to move faster to tackle the climate emergency. US oil giants ExxonMobil and Chevron both suffered shareholder rebellions, with 61% of Chevron shareholders supporting a resolution to set targets to reduce all of its emissions. Activist hedge fund Engine No. 1 got two directors elected to the board of ExxonMobil. And in a landmark case in the Hague, a Dutch court ruled that Royal Dutch Shell must reduce its global carbon emissions by 45% by the end of 2030. Dan Gocher, Director of Climate &amp; Environment at the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR) says these developments have “massive implications”. “This news is nothing short of extraordinary, and it will have massive implications for the Australian oil and gas industry. “Chevron, ExxonMobil and Shell are three of Australia’s largest oil and gas producers, and therefore three of our largest carbon polluters. “All three companies will now be under enormous pressure from both shareholders and the wider public to cut emissions, and cut them fast. European markets are rather subdued, after a lacklustre day’s trading in Asia which saw Japan’s Nikkei drop 0.3% and the Hong Kong Hang Seng dip 0.2%. Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst for Asia Pacific at OANDA, says: Some of the week’s froth has come out of the markets in Asia today, with equities edging lower, along with energy and precious metals and our good friends, the cryptocurrency space, while the US Dollar edged higher after an impressive rally overnight. All the financial markets space, the price action looks corrective, rather than a structural turn, as short-term momentum ran out of the “inflation is dead, buy everything” that has swept markets this week.

The federal Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, told question time Scott Morrison had “two fundamental jobs this year” – the mass rollout of Covid-19 vaccines and standing up “a safe national quarantine system”. “This week he has been shown to have failed at both,” Albanese said. The Victorian outbreak has prompted the commonwealth to accelerate vaccinations for aged care residents with a change of policy flagged during question time in Canberra. Previously, the advice had been to wait 14 days between being vaccinated for the flu and Covid, but the federal health minister, Greg Hunt, revealed a shift on Thursday. Australia’s chief medical officer, Prof Paul Kelly, later confirmed the change telling reporters previous medical advice about needing a two-week gap had been rescinded for aged care facilities in Victoria to allow an expedited rollout of the coronavirus vaccine. Hunt told ABC’s 7.30 program that as of Wednesday there were 74 aged care facilities across the country still to be vaccinated. “We’ve had 98% around Australia [done],” the health minister said when asked about a February pledge to vaccinate all aged care homes within six weeks. Responding to vaccine hesitancy in the community that has been a contributing factor to the slow pace of inoculations, Kelly urged those eligible to get the jab as soon as possible. “To protect yourself, your family and to contribute to the protection of the whole community in Australia, if you are in those groups where vaccination is available right now, please, make that appointment and get vaccinated,” Kelly said. The prime minister also signalled that a new quarantine centre could be built in Victoria sooner than anticipated with negotiations with the state close to being finalised. The jurisdictions have been haggling over cost-sharing. The Melbourne-based Greens leader, Adam Bandt, was even more pointed in his criticism than Albanese. Bandt characterised Victoria’s response to rising Covid cases as a “Morrison government lockdown” as he criticised the government for failing to vaccinate even 5% of the population so far. “The US has managed to fully vaccinate 50% of its adult population, so why can’t you even break 5%?” Bandt asked. “In Victoria, we have already done more than our fair share to stop the third wave so why haven’t you done yours?” Morrison responded to the criticism by stating his “two jobs” during the pandemic had been to “save lives and to save livelihoods”. The prime minister said the vaccination rollout was gathering pace. “That is what my government has been doing, in concert with all state and territory governments around this country, and most importantly, with the people of Australia,” Morrison said. The Liberal leader acknowledged people in Victoria would “go through a difficult period over these next seven days”, but he said: “We have faced these challenges in the face of Covid before and we will overcome them again.” The latest outbreak started with a leak from hotel quarantine in Adelaide, which the South Australian government found was the result of aerosol transmission. Labor questioned why the government had not yet introduced mandatory national standards for the hotel quarantine system. The federal shadow health minister, Mark Butler, asked: “Given the prime minister’s refusal to implement a national quarantine system, why has he refused to implement strong standards on aerosol and ventilation to stop these outbreaks within hotel quarantine?” Morrison replied that he didn’t accept Butler’s “assertions”. He said the South Australian government had followed its protocols.","charCount":"4277","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/katharine-murphy\">Katharine Murphy</a> and <a href=\"profile/sarah-martin\">Sarah Martin</a>"},{"headline":"UN rights body debates ‘systematic discrimination’ in Israel and Palestine","standfirst":"<p>UN chief says Israel attacks on Gaza could constitute war crimes and accuses Hamas of firing indiscriminate rockets</p>","trailText":"UN chief says Israel attacks on Gaza could constitute war crimes and accuses Hamas of firing indiscriminate rockets","byline":"Oliver Holmes in Jerusalem","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"03e278ace134a23aa99210765389dd8a4ba99afe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/03e278ace134a23aa99210765389dd8a4ba99afe/0_130_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The UN high commissioner for human rights, Michelle Bachelet, delivers her speech remotely at the opening of the emergency session in Geneva.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The UN high commissioner for human rights, Michelle Bachelet, delivers her speech remotely at the opening of the emergency session in Geneva.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>The UN’s main human rights body is to meet to discuss launching an investigation into “systematic discrimination and repression” in Israel and Palestine, with the aim of identifying what it said were the root causes of recent Gaza bloodshed.</p> <p>A draft proposal that calls for unprecedented levels of scrutiny of alleged abuses, called at the request of Muslim states, will be put before the 47-member UN human rights council on Thursday.</p> <p>Opening the session in Geneva, the UN rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, said Israel’s attacks on Gaza this month could constitute war crimes if they were found to be disproportionate, and accused Hamas of firing indiscriminate rockets on Israel.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/22/we-dont-recognise-our-own-city-israeli-barrage-redraws-the-map-of-gaza\">Eleven days of the worst fighting</a> in years claimed more than 250 lives in Gaza, including 66 children, and 12 in Israel, including two children.</p> <p>However, according to a draft of the resolution, seen by the Guardian ahead of a Thursday vote, the UN agency will call to urgently establish a commission to investigate all “violations”, not only in Gaza but also in the West Bank, Jerusalem and Israel.</p> <p>The text said the commission would investigate “all underlying root causes of recurrent tensions, instability and protraction of conflict, including systematic discrimination and repression based on national, ethnic, racial or religious identity”.</p> <p>Meirav Eilon Shahar, Israel’s ambassador to the UN in Geneva, criticised the body.</p> <p>Their sole purpose, she said on Wednesday, was “to blame Israel, whitewash the crimes committed by Hamas, and for the Palestinian Authority to avoid assuming its responsibilities towards its own population”.</p> <p>The commission follows moves by some diplomats and international bodies to reframe the crisis amid an evolving global debate on racism, and to present violence within the context of Israel’s decades-long control over millions of Palestinians.</p> <p>On Sunday, France’s foreign minister said the status quo would lead to a “risk of apartheid”, an accusation that has largely been levelled by activists and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/27/israel-committing-crime-apartheid-human-rights-watch\">rights groups</a> rather than governments.</p> <p>On Wednesday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/26/ireland-israel-de-facto-annexation-palestinian-land\">Ireland’s government supported</a> a motion that condemned Israel’s “de facto annexation” of Palestinian land in what it said was the first use of the phrase by an EU government in relation to Israel.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/26/ireland-israel-de-facto-annexation-palestinian-land\">Ireland condemns ‘de facto annexation’ of Palestinian land by Israel</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ireland’s foreign minister, Simon Coveney, described what he said was Israel’s “manifestly unequal” treatment of the Palestinian people.

A draft proposal that calls for unprecedented levels of scrutiny of alleged abuses, called at the request of Muslim states, will be put before the 47-member UN human rights council on Thursday. Opening the session in Geneva, the UN rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, said Israel’s attacks on Gaza this month could constitute war crimes if they were found to be disproportionate, and accused Hamas of firing indiscriminate rockets on Israel. Eleven days of the worst fighting in years claimed more than 250 lives in Gaza, including 66 children, and 12 in Israel, including two children. However, according to a draft of the resolution, seen by the Guardian ahead of a Thursday vote, the UN agency will call to urgently establish a commission to investigate all “violations”, not only in Gaza but also in the West Bank, Jerusalem and Israel. The text said the commission would investigate “all underlying root causes of recurrent tensions, instability and protraction of conflict, including systematic discrimination and repression based on national, ethnic, racial or religious identity”. Meirav Eilon Shahar, Israel’s ambassador to the UN in Geneva, criticised the body. Their sole purpose, she said on Wednesday, was “to blame Israel, whitewash the crimes committed by Hamas, and for the Palestinian Authority to avoid assuming its responsibilities towards its own population”. The commission follows moves by some diplomats and international bodies to reframe the crisis amid an evolving global debate on racism, and to present violence within the context of Israel’s decades-long control over millions of Palestinians. On Sunday, France’s foreign minister said the status quo would lead to a “risk of apartheid”, an accusation that has largely been levelled by activists and rights groups rather than governments. On Wednesday, Ireland’s government supported a motion that condemned Israel’s “de facto annexation” of Palestinian land in what it said was the first use of the phrase by an EU government in relation to Israel. Ireland’s foreign minister, Simon Coveney, described what he said was Israel’s “manifestly unequal” treatment of the Palestinian people. He added that the “strategic nature of Israel’s actions on settlement expansion and the intent behind it have brought us to a point where we need to be honest about what is actually happening on the ground”. Israel has strongly denied allegations of apartheid. The foreign ministry spokesman, Lior Haiat, tweeted that Ireland’s “outrageous and baseless position” reflected a “blatantly one-sided and simplistic policy”. The French and Irish statements contrast starkly with that of the US and UK, which have kept in line with longstanding policy.

This trip is self-guided using pre-loaded GPS devices, but Roam are on hand for assistance if you need.

Depending on the standard of the group and the seasonal conditions, <strong>Stonehaven Paddle Boarding</strong> can tailor the tour to include negotiating hardcore sections of the river, involving rapids of varying difficulties.

A buddy system encourages them to work together with a fellow adventurer.

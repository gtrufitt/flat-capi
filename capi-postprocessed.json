The budget deficit is expected to hit $1.8tn in 2022.</p> <p><strong>But the documents will also be aspirational.</strong> Biden’s Democrats hold only narrow majorities in the House and Senate, and the Republicans are pushing for a smaller infrastructure package instead.

President Joe Biden will propose $5 trillion in new federal spending over the next decade on Friday, part of his fiscal year 2022 budget request, a source familiar with the proposal tells CNBC. The new spending would be paid for in part by $3.6 trillion in additional revenues over the same period. The result would be a net deficit of $1.4 trillion, which would begin shrinking after 2030. Biden will include $300 billion of the $5 trillion total in his budget request to Congress for fiscal year 2022. This will bring the president’s total budget request for next year to $6 trillion, the source said. European stocks have hit a new all-time high, as optimism over the economic recovery continues to lift share prices across the region. The Europe-wide Stoxx 600 index has gained 0.45% this morning to 448.45 points, a fresh record. Every sector is higher, led by financials, industrial stocks and utilities. The Stoxx 600 has now gained over 12% so far this year, amid optimism that Europe’s economy will rebound strongly from the pandemic - now that Covid-19 vaccination programs have picked up speed. Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC are both up around 0.4%. Recent European economic data has shown activity is picking up strongly, with business growth hitting a three-year high this month and the EC upgrading its own growth forecasts. America’s strong recovery, and president Biden’s spending plans, are also providing a lift. Frédérique Carrier, Head of Investment Strategy, RBC Wealth Management, says the European economy is reviving faster than most observers expected. Europe, where many countries had to extend lockdown measures, is finally emerging from a long economic winter thanks to lower infection rates and an accelerating vaccine rollout. Carrier has upgraded his view on European equities to ‘overweight’, predicting they will see a ‘conducive climate’ over the next six to 12 months. As macroeconomic momentum builds, earnings delivery is strong and both management and consensus forecasts are being revised upwards. The Q1 reporting season was exceptionally robust, with companies in the Euro STOXX Index, an index of some 300 European companies, easily beating consensus expectations and generating earnings per share growth of close to 40 percent year over year, driven by sales increases and margin expansion. Moreover, management teams overall were optimistic on a demand recovery, though some noted concerns regarding supply shortages. Most were confident of their pricing power and ability to reduce costs. Following a heady Q1, upgraded forecasts suggest the earnings recovery is likely to last into next year. The consensus is looking for earnings growth of around 15 percent year over year for 2022. In the City, the blue-chip FTSE 100 index has risen 30 points to 7050 points, up 0.45%. Top risers include energy firm SSE (+2.6%), and UK housebuilders Taylor Wimpey (+2.5%), Barratt Development (+2.4%) and Persimmon (+2.1%). Luxury fashion group Burberry (+2.5%), and financial stocks such as HSBC (+2.4%) and Prudential (+2.4%) are also higher this morning. Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor, says the prospect of higher inflation is pushing the market up. “Further signs that the US economy is beginning to run hot prompted another switch into value stocks, at the expense of growth. The renewed consideration of cyclical stocks as an investment destination has generally played into the hands of the FTSE100, which has now risen by 9% in the year to date. The index is replete with sectors falling into the recovery category, such as the banks, oils and miners. For the likes of the airlines and the hospitality sectors, however, the outlook remains rather more cloudy as both travel restrictions and the emergence of Covid-19 variants hinder a smooth return to some sort of normality. The US stock market is expected to open higher later today. The Dow Jones industrial average up around 0.5% in pre-market trading, adding to yesterday’s 0.4% gain. Australia’s benchmark stock index, the S&amp;P/ASX 200, has hit a record closing high today, amid renewed optimism in the global economic outlook and the prospect of a $6tn Biden budget. The mining sector was leading the gains with financials, energy, industrials and consumer staples also higher. Higher US spending could mean greater demand for commodities and a wider boost to growth. This lifted the index to its highest close, and near the intraday high hit early in the pandemic. The Australian Financial Review reports: A sharp rally in domestic miners and energy stocks drove the S&amp;P/ASX 200 Index to a fresh closing high of 7179.5, rising 84.6 points, or 1.2 per cent, on Friday amid speculation that US President Joe Biden is planning an infrastructure friendly $6 trillion budget. Shares exceeded their May 10 record of 7172.8 points, but not the intraday high of 7197 set on February 20, 2020. Asian stocks have put global equities on course for a seventh day of gains today as investors bet the U.S. will lead the world out of the COVID-19 pandemic, points out Reuters. While Japan’s Nikkei led the way with a 2.1% jump, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 0.3% earlier today. The MSCI world equity index added 0.1% to 709.71, nearing the all-time closing high of 710.36 set on May 7. However, China’s CSI 300 index dipped by 0.3%. Kyle Rodda of IG explains why president Biden’s budget plans have lifted spirits: Given its sensitivity to swings in the business cycle, commodity prices and global trade, Asia’s financial markets could arguably be said to benefit most from a big spending US fiscal package. As much seemed to manifest in the region’s stock markets today: Asia’s benchmark indices have generally put in solid rallies to end the month – with the notable exception of Chinese stocks, which have traded flat – as markets discount the possibility of another pump-priming of global growth by the US. The export sensitive Nikkei has been the noteworthy outperformer, despite Japan extending its state of emergency today. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Global stock markets are nudging higher as investors brace for president Joe Biden to propose a $6tn spending package when he unveils his first budget later today. Biden is expected to propose record federal spending of $6tn in the 2022 financial year, starting in October, rising to $8.2 trillion by 2031, according to a report in the New York Times. Citing documents it had obtained, the NYT said the Democratic president planned to pay for his agenda through increased taxes on corporations and high earners, with budget deficits expected to decrease in the 2030s. The budget will show how Biden intends to deliver on his sweeping domestic agenda. That includes the American Jobs Plan to build new transport, water, energy and broadband infrastructure, modernise homes, and boost manufacturing, and the American Families Plan to invest more in childcare and education. The budget will also outline how the White House see inflation, employment, and economic growth panning out. The budget deficit is expected to hit $1.8tn in 2022. But the documents will also be aspirational. Biden’s Democrats hold only narrow majorities in the House and Senate, and the Republicans are pushing for a smaller infrastructure package instead. So a pitched battle lies ahead. As Reuters explains: Republicans have criticized the president for seeking trillions in new spending, setting the stage for pitched battles over his priorities. “It just seems like the trillions keep on coming,” Republican U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito, who is leading a group of colleagues pursuing a counteroffer to Biden’s current $1.7 trillion infrastructure proposal. Yesterday, president Biden told an event in Cleveland that it’s the right time to invest in the economic recovery: “Now is the time to build (upon) the foundation that we’ve laid to make bold investments in our families and our communities and our nation. We know from history that these kinds of investments raise both the floor and the ceiling over the economy for everybody.” Hailing the recent progress against Covid-19, Biden added: “We’ve turned the tide on the once-in-a-century pandemic. “And now we’re faced with a question: what kind of economy are we going to build for tomorrow? What are we going to do? I believe this is our moment to rebuild an economy from the bottom up and the middle out.” Asia-Pacific equity markets have been boosted overnight, with Japan’s Nikkei jumping 2.1% and South Korea’s Kospi gaining 0.8%. Investors anticipate that this surge in US spending will feed through to the global economy, as Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at OANDA, explains: President Biden’s Preliminary Budget is envisaging a $1.8 trillion deficit next year, after tax rises. Of course, what the President would like, and what he will get from Congress could be quite different, but with that level of spending, Asia appears to feel that some of that goody bag will fall their way, and Asian equity markets have risen today Strong economic data yesterday is also supporting stocks, with the number of new US jobless claims falling to a pandemic low yesterday, and US growth confirmed at a pacy 1.6% in the last quarter (while the UK and eurozone contracted). Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote, says: A robust GDP growth in the first quarter, a fresh pandemic low print in weekly jobless claims and the talk of a $6 trillion federal spending package for the coming fiscal year boosted appetite in most equities and the US dollar. But could inflation fears spoil the party again? Later today we get the latest ‘core PCE price’ index -- the US Federal Reserve’s preferred gauge of inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices. It’s expected to jump to 2.9% on a yearly basis from 1.8%. The University of Michigan’s final consumer morale index for May is likely to highlight that inflation worries are hitting confidence (as the preliminary report showed earlier this month).

Odd as it sounds De Bruyne was left out completely for the quarter-final first leg defeat against Spurs in 2019. Before that he was part of a midfield exposed by Liverpool’s raptor-like gegenpress, and the weirdly open team blown away by Monaco. Last season he was the main man as City overpowered Real Madrid, then let down by the unexpected flakiness of his teammates in that supine loss to Lyon. “We need to learn,” he said, and this team, and indeed his own role, has been reconfigured. One step now from a more measurable kind of greatness.","charCount":"5693","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/barneyronay\">Barney Ronay</a>"},{"headline":"Competition: name the date of the Guardian article – week four","standfirst":"<p> Guess the date the story first appeared to be in with a chance of winning prizes including a ticket to a Masterclass of your choice </p>","trailText":" Guess the date the story first appeared to be in with a chance of winning prizes including a ticket to a Masterclass of your choice ","byline":"","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0664e15dc43d02242ca091af6d7b7a0b32c21a0b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0664e15dc43d02242ca091af6d7b7a0b32c21a0b/0_323_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The first 10 randomly chosen readers who correctly identify the dates (or got closest to them) will receive prizes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The first 10 randomly chosen readers who correctly identify the dates (or got closest to them) will receive prizes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p><em>To mark the Guardian’s bicentenary, we are running a competition for readers.

At Oxford Circus, as at the other stations, they are to replace the lifts altogether, and so far as one can see the present policy of the Underground management is to install them at all busy stations or at any rate at all those where the tube is not too deep down to make the system difficult. It does not seem, however, to have been realised that these stairways make the use of the tubes impossible for elderly or infirm or even markedly nervous people. A lame person could not use them nor can very many women, especially those over middle age, nor is it likely they can ever learn to. The lifts, on the other hand, were possible for all, and if the moving stairways were at all generally introduced there would, I think, be a good deal of dissatisfaction.

Planes, trains and automobiles – the urban symphony.</p> <p>“Georgetown is the noisiest neighborhood,” says the 63-year-old Donaldson after sitting down at an outdoor table at All City Coffee, clad in sport sandals, khaki shorts and a gray Washington State University sweatshirt.</p> <p>Donaldson, a military brat who was born in England, played basketball at WSU, and started his 14-year NBA career in 1980 on the other side of the state with the now-defunct Seattle Supersonics. (After a dubious hijacking by a shifty crew of Dust Bowl oilmen, they are now known as the Oklahoma City Thunder.) For Donaldson, who holds the NBA record for most games played (957) without ever attempting a three-point shot, squeezing into a normal-sized human’s chair is like a normal-sized human squeezing into a kindergartener’s chair. His demeanor is cerebral and soothing; if he could get paid to read people to sleep, Donaldson would make top dollar. As for the Saturn, he had to have the seat moved back, which is par for the course for any vehicle he’s ever driven.</p> <p>This is Donaldson’s second run for mayor of Seattle, a city which seems to lurch further leftward with every passing year. The first time he ran, in 2009, he finished a disappointing fourth and failed to emerge from the primary election. But still, life was good. He was a well-respected businessman, with six physical therapy clinics and a side venture that saw him traveling to China, where he met his wife and her son. He owned a home in a nice neighborhood and served on the board of directors for the National Basketball Retired Players Association.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"781c85852d2ac8990cad9fc3cd56560219be1a5f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/781c85852d2ac8990cad9fc3cd56560219be1a5f/0_129_963_1219/790.jpg\" alt=\"James Donaldson\" width=\"790\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Donaldson has gone from athlete to politician.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Donaldson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“I had lived a very charmed life,” he says. “I had no problems, no issues.”</p> <p>But then, one day in 2015, “the whole table went upside down”.</p> <p>That was when Donaldson – a vegetarian and non-drinker who was, to that point, the portrait of health – suffered <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/aortic-dissection/symptoms-causes/syc-20369496\">an aortic dissection</a>, a heart problem that is common among tall people. Donaldson underwent open-heart surgery, the first of four major heart procedures over the next few years. Unable to manage his businesses, he trusted others to do it for him – and they failed. His mother died and his wife left him, taking her son with her. Donaldson declared bankruptcy and had his house foreclosed upon. He now lives in a one-bedroom apartment.</p> <p>“I’d lost my purpose: I was no longer a business owner, I was no longer a husband, I no longer had a healthy nest egg waiting for me in retirement,” says Donaldson, who grew so depressed that he contemplated suicide, going as far as to plan the method.</p> <p>“I had everything all worked out. It was just a matter of when,” he recalls. “I started getting these impulsive voices and I’ve never really been an impulsive kind of guy. I’d always been very thoughtful and methodical. That was the scariest part, when those impulsive voices told me to go ahead and do it.”</p> <p>Rather than take his own life, Donaldson called his doctor, who got him to see a psychotherapist. Donaldson also leaned heavily on longtime friends like Tim Johnson, a commercial realtor who helped him open one of his physical therapy locations, and Chuck Wright, a mental-health professional who would regularly provide counseling at one of Donaldson’s other clinics.</p> <p>“I visited him in the hospital quite a few times and watched him fight that, but it seemed to me that that really took a toll on his emotions and his mental health,” recalls Johnson. “I watched him just seem tortured by that depression.

Planes, trains and automobiles – the urban symphony. “Georgetown is the noisiest neighborhood,” says the 63-year-old Donaldson after sitting down at an outdoor table at All City Coffee, clad in sport sandals, khaki shorts and a gray Washington State University sweatshirt. Donaldson, a military brat who was born in England, played basketball at WSU, and started his 14-year NBA career in 1980 on the other side of the state with the now-defunct Seattle Supersonics. (After a dubious hijacking by a shifty crew of Dust Bowl oilmen, they are now known as the Oklahoma City Thunder.) For Donaldson, who holds the NBA record for most games played (957) without ever attempting a three-point shot, squeezing into a normal-sized human’s chair is like a normal-sized human squeezing into a kindergartener’s chair. His demeanor is cerebral and soothing; if he could get paid to read people to sleep, Donaldson would make top dollar. As for the Saturn, he had to have the seat moved back, which is par for the course for any vehicle he’s ever driven. This is Donaldson’s second run for mayor of Seattle, a city which seems to lurch further leftward with every passing year. The first time he ran, in 2009, he finished a disappointing fourth and failed to emerge from the primary election. But still, life was good. He was a well-respected businessman, with six physical therapy clinics and a side venture that saw him traveling to China, where he met his wife and her son. He owned a home in a nice neighborhood and served on the board of directors for the National Basketball Retired Players Association. “I had lived a very charmed life,” he says. “I had no problems, no issues.” But then, one day in 2015, “the whole table went upside down”. That was when Donaldson – a vegetarian and non-drinker who was, to that point, the portrait of health – suffered an aortic dissection, a heart problem that is common among tall people. Donaldson underwent open-heart surgery, the first of four major heart procedures over the next few years. Unable to manage his businesses, he trusted others to do it for him – and they failed. His mother died and his wife left him, taking her son with her. Donaldson declared bankruptcy and had his house foreclosed upon. He now lives in a one-bedroom apartment. “I’d lost my purpose: I was no longer a business owner, I was no longer a husband, I no longer had a healthy nest egg waiting for me in retirement,” says Donaldson, who grew so depressed that he contemplated suicide, going as far as to plan the method. “I had everything all worked out. It was just a matter of when,” he recalls. “I started getting these impulsive voices and I’ve never really been an impulsive kind of guy. I’d always been very thoughtful and methodical. That was the scariest part, when those impulsive voices told me to go ahead and do it.” Rather than take his own life, Donaldson called his doctor, who got him to see a psychotherapist. Donaldson also leaned heavily on longtime friends like Tim Johnson, a commercial realtor who helped him open one of his physical therapy locations, and Chuck Wright, a mental-health professional who would regularly provide counseling at one of Donaldson’s other clinics. “I visited him in the hospital quite a few times and watched him fight that, but it seemed to me that that really took a toll on his emotions and his mental health,” recalls Johnson. “I watched him just seem tortured by that depression. I’ve had a few friends over the years struggle with that and a couple who have committed suicide, and thought to myself, if I could ever be involved with a friend who was struggling with that, there was nothing I wouldn’t do to help. Then I watched him lose his wife, lose his business, lose everything, really. So, I would call him maybe at a time I normally wouldn’t call him just to see how he was doing. Quite a few of those times, he’d say, ‘Not doing good.’ He’s honest; he says it the way it is.” Adds Wright, who often counsels first responders, “James knew I dealt with people who were suicidal. He reached out to three to four of us and used us as his resource. I credit him with reaching out; we can’t help people who don’t reach out. Police officers, when they need help, they call for backup. We were James’ backup. He’d call me and I’d call him at maybe 2 or 3 o’clock in the morning. It’s dark and the curtains are figuratively and realistically closed and the only person you’re talking to is yourself, and you’re not giving yourself good advice.” Donaldson is a lifelong Democrat who, by his own admission, doesn’t “necessarily toe the party line”. To wit, unlike many of his mayoral rivals in a crowded field, he is stridently pro-police, feeling that they should be fully funded and given quarterly breaks from their beats to undergo enhanced training and mental-health counseling. And his campaign consultant, Alex Hays, is a Republican, which betrays a strategy to attract moderate and center-right voters who feel that City Hall is wildly out of step with everyday people on issues like homelessness, transportation and public safety. But while he respects Hays, longtime Seattle writer and historian Knute ‘Skip’ Berger thinks the consultant could be a potential liability for Donaldson. “I think it could hurt him –and that’s no rap on Alex,” Berger says. “Alex is a smart guy, so I can see why that would be appealing. But it’s a political negative in Seattle for anyone who’s consorted with Republicans.” Donaldson hasn’t attended a therapy session for two years, but he still talks to Wright and other friends in the mental health field regularly. While he believes formal counseling helped him turn things around, Donaldson, who’s Black, laments that the therapists he got connected with were younger white individuals who “had absolutely nothing in common with me”. This is why Donaldson, who runs a charitable foundation, has made it his mission to encourage more people of color to pursue careers in mental health, an endeavor – which would include a college scholarship fund – that Wright agrees is much-needed. “We need mental-health professionals of color who identify with people culturally and ideologically and traditionally,” Donaldson says. Donaldson says there’s also a stigma surrounding mental health that’s long inhibited communities of color – and men in general. “Traditionally, culturally and historically, communities of color have not readily accepted that mental health is an issue. We’ve handed so much of this over to God,” Donaldson, an active churchgoer, observes. “African American culture – we’re so locked into this ever-caring God symbol, that he’ll take care of us and we don’t need to reach out to other people.

Pressure is growing on the government to begin the public inquiry into its handling of the Covid pandemic, days after the prime minister’s former top adviser Dominic Cummings said any delay was “completely terrible”. Our social affairs correspondent, Robert Booth has more: Boris Johnson is facing a growing clamour to bring forward the start of the coronavirus public inquiry after Dominic Cummings’ allegations triggered a “political pantomime” that disrespects the victims of the pandemic, their relatives said. The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group, which represents thousands of grieving people, called for an urgent start to the inquiry, which is due to begin in spring 2022. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) joined the call, alongside Lord Kerslake, the former head of the civil service under David Cameron, Angela Rayner, the deputy Labour leader, and Ed Davey, the leader of the Liberal Democrats.

Africa is in a race against time to vaccinate as many people as possible amid signs the virus may be surging again with the approach of winter in the southern hemisphere, when people spend more time indoors, typically allowing for more spread of disease. It is also a critical front in the fight against the virus in Africa, with South Africa recording 40% of the continent’s Covid-19 deaths. Since January, South Africa has vaccinated nearly 500,000 of its 1.2 million healthcare workers and now is adding its older citizens to the campaign. In the past two weeks, nearly 200,000 have received their Pfizer jabs with instructions to come back in six weeks to get their second dose. After a plateau of the disease that lasted a few months, South Africa’s new cases, hospitalisations and deaths are trending up. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases has risen over the past two weeks from 3.33 per 100,000 people on 12 May to 3.97 per 100,000 on Wednesday, according to Johns Hopkins University. The seven-day rolling average of deaths is also on the rise: from 0.10 deaths per 100,000 people to 0.11 per 100,000 over the same period. The increase may seem small, but experts warn it may be the start of a resurgence as the country enters the colder winter months, which start in June. The national coronavirus task force met this week and President Cyril Ramaphosa’s government is pondering the possibility of reimposing restrictions, such as reducing the hours that alcohol can be sold and limiting the number of people at gatherings. “We’re under pressure to reach higher levels of vaccination,” Mosa Moshabela, professor of public health at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, told the Associated Press. “New vaccination centers are opening every day and the numbers being given shots should quickly go from 20,000 elderly per day to 50,000 and then 100,000 per day,” he said. “By June we should reach 200,000 per day. We need to have that kind of volume to get close to vaccinating 5 million elderly by the end of June.” South Africa’s overall goal is to vaccinate 67% of its 60 million people by February. Czech restaurants will open to indoor diners from Monday, health minister Adam Vojtech said this morning, announcing a quicker-than-planned easing of Covid-19 restrictions. Reuters report that the Czech Republic will also open up to tourists from seven countries – Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia, Croatia, Austria and Germany – under reciprocal agreements. Harry Taylor is on our UK live blog duties this morning, and he’s just got that started for the day. If you are after UK news, then you can follow that with him here … I’ll be continuing here with the latest global coronavirus news. The deputy prime minister of Ireland, Leo Varadkar, has said that Irish citizens should be able move more freely across the European Union from mid-July, but cast doubt on whether it would also apply to Britain. “The advice that we have, and we’re accepting this advice, is that there are real concerns about the Indian variant and for that reason, we’re not in a position to restore the common travel area just yet,” Varadkar told national broadcaster RTE. Reuters report he said there would continue to be restrictions for arrivals from Britain, including requirements to have a vaccine or a negative Covid-19 test, even once travel opens up using the EU’s “green certificate”. Very quick snap from Reuters that a Japanese health ministry panel has approved the use of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine for those aged 12 and above. The move, which lowers the threshold from 16, follows approvals in the US and other nations this month for the vaccine to be used for adolescents. On the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, UK business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng was pushed on the issue of people being discharged from hospital to care homes without testing. He was fairly steadfast in repeatedly saying that testing capacity had to be built from scratch, and that is what Matt Hancock and the department did. Weeks into Taiwan’s worst outbreak since the pandemic began, and 10 days after the island was put on the third highest level of social restrictions, daily totals of new cases are still not decreasing, the health minister has conceded. In today’s daily press conference, minister Chen Chih-shung reported 19 new deaths, 297 new cases and an additional 258 cases from a backlog of cases stretching as far as 10 days. He said the trends appeared stable, and were not rising, but the fact they were not visibly decreasing suggested there was still unidentified spread. The 19 deaths is the third consecutive record for daily fatalities. Taiwan is currently on alert level 3, of a four-tier system. Recreation, entertainment and sporting venues have closed, restaurants ordered to do take-away only, and working from home encouraged but not enforced. The backlog of cases has made assessment of trends - and the effectiveness of the response measures - difficult, with up to 95 cases at a time being added to previous daily totals. For the first time in this outbreak, Chen has flagged a possible move to level 4, requiring a lockdown. Until now he has said it would not happen unless there were 14 consecutive days of more than 100 cases (which has happened) and a rate of at least 50% untraced (which has not happened). He said they need to get a clearer picture of the trends, and would have more information early next week. Chen also announced local governments would be allowed to facilitate their own vaccine purchases, with FDA approval, acknowledging the central government’s processes were not procuring fast enough to meet Taiwan’s needs in the context of the current outbreak. About 330,000 people have received at least one vaccine so far, from a population of 24 million. Taiwan’s hospitals have also been told to double their Covid patient capacity by allowing two patients to a room, instead of one. A €2.5bn (£2.15bn) package has been agreed by the German government to help the culture industry get back on its feet as the country slowly emerges from a third wave of the Covid pandemic. The finance minister, Olaf Scholz, has called the package “the biggest cultural subsidy programme” since the end of the second world war. The coronavirus cultural fund is intended to give organisers of events assurances that they will be compensated if performances and concerts are not able to go ahead as planned, as well as making up for the loss of ticket sales due to reduced seating as a result of social distancing regulations. Initially the measures will protect events of up to 500 participants, so that if from 1 July an event has to be cancelled, the organiser will be fully compensated. From the end of August, in anticipation of events being able to increase in size, that will go up to 2,000 participants. The measures, coming as Germany starts to open up after months of tight restrictions, are on top of a multimillion-euro neustart kultur (new start culture) programme announced last year to cover events across the country. “Life is starting again after a long coronavirus winter,” Scholz said. Monika Grütters, the culture minister, said the fund sent a signal to the cultural industry that its “resuscitation deserves the same amount of effort which is being given to other branches”. Read more of Kate Connolly’s report from Berlin: Germany agrees €2.5bn package to help revive Covid-hit culture sector Yesterday UK housing minister Robert Jenrick was touting next spring as a possible starting date for a Covid inquiry. Opposition Labour MP David Lammy has just joined calls to rapidly bring that date forward in the light of the revelations from Dominic Cummings earlier in the week. Meanwhile on LBC, shock-jock Nick Ferrari has been lambasting business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng saying he should be “kicking the door down” of the prime minister, “banging the desk and saying ‘We have got to stick to 21 June, prime minister!’”. Kwarteng replies “You know what Nick, that’s exactly what I’m doing.” The rest of his answer doesn’t make it sound like he is doing that, however, as he reiterates form his earlier media appearances that “What I can’t do is give guarantees on the 28 May” and continues to hold the line that the government will be following the data and there will not be a decision until 14 June. Mario Koran reports for us from Milwaukee that Wisconsin is the ground zero of America’s battle against vaccine hesitancy: Vaccination rates in Wisconsin vary widely between rural and urban areas and political, religious and racial divides – a pattern that mirrors the divide across the nation. In the progressive stronghold of Dane county – home to the University of Wisconsin-Madison – more than 65% of the population has received one dose. In the state’s rural north, Taylor county has vaccinated only 23.5% of the population, state data shows. Vaccine availability once posed the biggest barrier to immunization. But as availability increased, demand plateaued. Now, healthcare professionals are strategizing ways to reach those who haven’t yet been vaccinated but remain open to it. “Most of our rural residents have the information they need about where and when to get vaccinated. So this is no longer primarily an issue about access to the vaccine. It truly is an issue of what is commonly called vaccine hesitancy,” said Tim Size, executive director of the Rural Wisconsin Health Cooperative, a network of 43 rural hospitals. “I’m not talking about those who just say hell will freeze over before they get the vaccine. That’s not where I think any of us probably need to spend our energy because it’s unlikely to get much traction. I’m talking about the number of people who are communicating that they’re not quite ready yet, but with more information and conversation, they may get there.” Read more of Mario Koran’s report from Milwaukee here: Wisconsin: ground zero of America’s battle against vaccine hesitancy Prof Christina Pagel, from University College London and a member of Independent Sage, said the India variant was causing concern and the road map should be delayed. She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “Certainly we have weakened the link significantly between cases and hospitalisations, but we haven’t broken it.” She added: “We now have fewer restrictions in England than we’ve had since the pandemic started, so if enough people get infected, even a really small proportion who need hospital can still end up being quite large absolute numbers.” Asked whether the planned further lockdown easing for 21 June should not go ahead, she said: “So far we’ve kind of been crossing our fingers a little bit, Sage and Public Health England both say it’s a more transmissible variant, we know it has some levels of vaccine escape. “So we’re in a situation where, compared to two months ago, we now have a dominant variant, it transmits faster, and our vaccines are less effective against it.” PA Media reports that asked if it would be “very demoralising” to remain as we are now, she said: “I think what’s demoralising is having a third wave. If we can just delay international travel, delay stage 4 of the road map until we have a much higher proportion of people vaccinated with two doses, we’re in a much, much better position. “We’re only two months away from that, it’s not long to wait. What I don’t want is for us to have new restrictions.” In the UK, business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has become the latest minister to defend health secretary Matt Hancock, saying “Very few people – if anyone – worked as hard as he did.” Hancock had an awkward time in front of parliament yesterday following accusations by former government adviser Dominic Cummings that he had lied to colleagues and the public during the early stages of the pandemic. Kwarteng said: “I think what Matt stressed very carefully yesterday was that he was absolutely focused, right from the start of the pandemic, on saving people’s lives. “He was in a difficult situation as the Health Secretary, in a pandemic, the like of which we hadn’t seen for 100 years. He was under huge pressure. “And as a Cabinet colleague, I know that he worked really hard and very few people - if anyone - worked as hard as he did and he was very committed to saving lives. Now, he said what he said, I fully believe him but we’ll have an inquiry and that will iron out all these facts.” Poulomi Ghosh reports for the Hindustan Times on a vaccine mix-up causing concern: At least 20 people in Uttar Pradesh’s Siddharthnagar district bordering Nepal were administered with different doses of vaccines, in a case of “negligence”. The 20 people who received two different vaccines in two slots are all from Audahi Kalan village and are aged above 45 years. On 1 April, there were given a dose of Covishield, which was their first dose. On 14 May, they were administered the second dose and as the health workers did not check the card to find out which vaccine was administered to them earlier, they were given Covaxin, by mistake. Reports said none of them reported any adverse effect. There are controlled trials ongoing in some countries of mixing vaccines to see if it increases effectiveness. Murdo Fraser of the Scottish Conservatives has criticised the continued restrictions in place across Glasgow. PA Media reports that he has said if the latest data shows infections are still high then a “more targeted” approach was needed. Areas of Glasgow with higher concentrations of coronavirus infections should be targeted with testing and vaccinations rather than the whole city being subject to “blanket” restrictions, the Scottish Conservatives have said. Fraser told the BBC’s Good Morning Scotland: “Our view is the current council-wide lockdown in Glasgow has not been the right approach. “Large parts of Glasgow do not see large numbers of people infected with Covid and yet are affected by these lockdown restrictions. “If the data is still showing a specific problem in Glasgow what we should be doing is isolating that problem … localised surge testing, accelerating vaccinations in those communities and greater support for local businesses who have been really suffering.” Glasgow has been under strict coronavirus restrictions for 270 days and is the only part of the country under tougher Level 3 constraints. An update on restrictions in Scotland’s largest city is expected later today from first minister Nicola Sturgeon. Overcrowding in Victoria’s healthcare system is a “bigger public health emergency than Covid”, according to a leading emergency physician who says the state’s doctors and nurses were exhausted even before the latest outbreak. Victoria is in a seven-day lockdown with 30 cases of community transmission, more than 120 exposure sites, and 15,000 primary and secondary contacts of cases in isolation. The Australasian College for Emergency Medicine Victoria faculty chair, Dr Mya Cubitt, said on Friday that doctors and nurses in public hospitals had been dreading such a situation because they were still recovering from Victoria’s second wave in 2020. At its height, there were more than 700 new cases in a single day. There were 768 deaths overall with hundreds of healthcare workers infected. “We are in the worst crisis that healthcare has faced in many years,” Cubitt said. “You could even say – and I’d love to speak with [chief health officer Prof] Brett Sutton about this – that the access block and overcrowding of the system is the bigger public health emergency at the moment. Whether we have a Covid outbreak or not, emergency clinicians, and all of the many colleagues that we intersect with in the healthcare system, are under extreme pressure.” Read more of Melissa Davey’s report here: Overcrowding in Victorian hospitals ‘bigger emergency than Covid’, expert warns Sky News have just posted a clip of that Kwasi Kwarteng interview on Twitter. Reuters have been looking at the impact of Covid in the South Asia region, and have found that the tally of cases there, according to their figures, passed 30 million today. They report that the south Asia region - India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Bhutan, Nepal, Maldives and Sri Lanka – accounts for 18% of global cases and almost 10% of deaths. But there is growing suspicion that official tallies of infections and deaths are not reflecting the true extent of the problem. India’s decision to halt the export of vaccines until at least October has had a knock-on effect, with other South Asia countries such as Nepal and Bangladesh making diplomatic efforts to secure Covid-19 vaccines to prop up their faltering inoculation drives as their stocks run out. India’s western neighbour Pakistan, with purchases and donations from China and allocations from the World Health Organisation and the GAVI Vaccine Alliance, has now secured more than 18m doses. Pakistan has opened its vaccination campaign to everyone aged 19 or older. As I mentioned, business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has been on Sky News, and he was rather downbeat when asked about the prospects for the roadmap out of lockdown. He said: We don’t want to proceed with the roadmap without considering all the information that we have. I think that the numbers of cases, is a matter of concern. Today’s the 28th of May. It’s impossible for anyone to know what the situation will be like in a week or two weeks time. On the positive side, he said “the other thing that’s very helpful and encouraging, is the fact that the numbers of hospitalizations, and the number of fatalities as well, is considerably lower than it was even just two months ago” Ultimately he keep reiterating that the UK government would be guided by data: There’s lots of facts that we have to consider. I, as business secretary, I’m very committed to try to reopen on 21 June, I can’t guarantee that. And as I’ve said, we’re looking at the data, every day. The UK government dashboard shows that cases, deaths and hospitalisations are all going up, albeit at much lower levels than they were at the height of the pandemic. Kwarteng confirmed that there would be no decision before 14 June. Good morning from London, it is Martin Belam here – you can get in touch with me at martin.belam@theguardian.com. The UK’s business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng looks to have drawn the short straw for media duties this morning – he’ll be on Sky News in a few moments. While we wait for that, here’s Lizzy Davies on calls for 6m more nurses worldwide: Health ministers around the world are being urged to sign off on plans to create 6m more nursing jobs by 2030, amid warnings that Covid-19 has exacerbated a global shortage and could spark a “brain drain” from the developing world. Delegates meeting virtually this week at the World Health Assembly, the key decision-making body of the World Health Organization, are expected to adopt a resolution calling on countries to transform the nursing profession through more investment, support and training. The WHO director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, called on countries to invest in healthcare workers, nearly 50% of whom are nurses and midwives, saying the pandemic had reminded everyone “that these are incredible people doing incredible jobs under incredible circumstances”. “We owe them so much, and yet globally health and care workers often lack the protection, the equipment, the training, the decent pay, the safe working conditions and the respect they deserve,” he said in his opening remarks. “If we have any hope of achieving a healthier, safer, fairer future, every member state must protect and invest in its health and care workforce as a matter of urgency.” Read more here: ‘Protect and invest’: WHO calls for 6m more nurses worldwide That’s it from me, Helen Sullivan, for today. And if, for a break from pandemic news, you’d like to see a praying mantis wearing “tiny homemade 3D glasses”, might I suggest: Russia has registered the world’s first vaccine for animals against Covid, its agricultural regulator said on Wednesday, after tests showed it generated antibodies against the virus in dogs, cats, foxes and mink, Reuters reports. Mass production of the vaccine, called Carnivac-Cov, can start in April, regulator Rosselkhoznadzor said. The World Health Organization has expressed concern over the transmission of the virus between humans and animals. The regulator said the vaccine would be able to protect vulnerable species and thwart viral mutations. Russia has so far only registered two cases of Covid among animals, both in cats. Denmark culled all 17 million mink on its farms last year after concluding that a strain of the virus had passed from humans to mink and that mutated strains of the virus had then turned up among people. Rosselkhoznadzor said Russian fur farms planned to buy the vaccine, along with businesses in Greece, Poland and Austria. Russia’s fur farm industry accounts for around 3% of the global market, down from 30% in the Soviet era, according to the main trade body. Thailand’s food and drug regulator on Friday approved for emergency use the coroanvirus vaccine developed by China’s Sinopharm, Reuters reports, citing a senior official. “The FDA has approved the Sinopharm vaccine,” senior health official Paisan Dankhum told a news conference, making it the fifth Covid-19 vaccine Thailand has approved. Japanese shares jumped on Friday, as investors scooped up stocks after sell-offs due to MSCI’s reshuffle in the previous session, while progress in the country’s vaccination drive lifted risk appetite on prospects of a swift economic recovery, Reuters reports. The Nikkei share average crossed the 29,000 level for the first time since 11 May, jumping 1.95% to 29,106.86, as of 0205 GMT. The index is poised for a weekly gain of 2.8%. Rollouts of Covid vaccines have contributed to positive sentiment as investors hope a steady vaccination drive can help accelerate economic recovery, market participants said. Japan said on Friday it would consider sharing its Covid vaccines with other countries as a ruling party committee urged it to provide a portion of its AstraZeneca Plc vaccine stock to Taiwan, Reuters reports. Taiwan is battling a spike in domestic infections and has vaccinated only about 1% of its population, while Japan has secured more than 400 million doses, double what it needs for its adult population. “We think it’s important to ensure fair access to safe and effective vaccines in every country and region towards achieving universal health coverage,” Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato told a news conference. “We will swiftly consider and look into a concrete course of policy with regard to how we provide other countries and regions with vaccines that exceed the amount for those needed at home. Masahisa Sato, the head of a Japanese ruling party committee on Taiwan relations, said earlier on Friday the government should provide Taiwan with vaccines as soon as possible, adding “when Japan was in need Taiwan sent us 2 million masks.” Kato declined to comment whether Tokyo had received supply requests from specific countries. India reported on Friday 186,364 new coronavirus infections during the previous 24 hours, for its lowest daily rise since April 14, while deaths rose by 3,660. The South Asian nation’s tally of infections now stands at 27.56 million, with the death toll at 318,895, health ministry data show. Japan is expected to extend emergency coronavirus measures in Tokyo and several other regions by about three weeks, according to officials, as the country struggles to rein in a fourth wave of infections less than two months before the Olympics. The state of emergency – the third in the capital since the start of the pandemic – was called in late April and was originally due to end on 11 May, but was extended until the end of this month, as restrictions on businesses failed to make a dent in infections. Media reports said the latest extension could last until 20 June. Infections have fallen in Tokyo in recent days, but the daily caseload is still too high to justify an end to the measures, according to medical experts, while hospitals are contending with a record number of critically ill Covid-19 patients: Hello and welcome to today’s live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic with me, Helen Sullivan. As always, you can get in touch with me on Twitter @helenrsullivan. India reported on Friday 186,364 new coronavirus infections during the previous 24 hours, for its lowest daily rise since April 14, while deaths rose by 3,660. The South Asian nation’s tally of infections now stands at 27.56 million, with the death toll at 318,895, health ministry data show. Meanwhile Japan is expected to extend emergency coronavirus measures in Tokyo and several other regions by about three weeks, according to officials, as the country struggles to rein in a fourth wave of infections less than two months before the Olympics. Here are the key developments from the last few hours: Argentina reported a record one-day number of new Covid-19 cases of 41,080 on Thursday, amid a second wave of infections that has made the country one of the hardest hit in the world, pushing the local health care system to its limit. Africa needs at least 20m doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine within six weeks if those who have had their first shot are to get the second in time, the WHO said on Thursday. Up to three-quarters of new UK Covid cases are thought to be caused by the variant first detected in India, as the reported number more than doubled to almost 7,000, Matt Hancock said on Thursday. The United States called on Thursday for the World Health Organization to carry out a second phase of its investigation into the origins of the coronavirus, with independent experts given full access to original data and samples in China. The US intelligence community acknowledged its agencies had two theories on where Covid-19 originated, with an element embracing a possible laboratory accident as the source of the pandemic. US President Joe Biden said he is likely to release a report detailing the US intelligence community’s findings on the origins of Covid-19 in full. Sweden will go forward with its plan to ease some of its Covid curbs from June 1, prime minister Stefan Lofven said. Germany plans to make enough Covid vaccine doses available to offer a first shot to all children aged 12 and over by the end of August, a draft health ministry document showed.","charCount":"26493","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a> (now) and <a href=\"profile/helen-sullivan\">Helen Sullivan</a> (earlier)"}]

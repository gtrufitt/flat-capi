I’m a big Andy Zaltzman fan, ever since his early days of the brilliant Bugle, and I’ve been lucky enough to see him live a few times in stand-up. He’s a very quick wit (and a notorious punner), and his love for cricket - stats especially - is just the right side of unhealthy obsession. He often repeats the same line at gigs: ‘Any cricket fans in today? Stick your hands up.... Great. Anyone not like cricket?... What the f*** IS WRONG WITH YOU?” Still makes me laugh. What I love is that this really is his dream job, and he’s a stand-up, podcaster, hosts the News Quiz, but really this is what he was born to do. TMS is a cuddlier, funnier, more brilliant place with him in it. And that’s the best thing, really.” </p> <p>Agreed. In the last decade or two there has been a lot of talk about modernising TMS, yoofspeak and all that. Zaltzman had modernised it in a far subtler way, and without compromising the spirit of the thing. Zaltzman and Brian Johnston is one of the great fantasy commentary teams.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60bb99fb8f082ac930aeb43f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-05T15:41:28.607Z\">4.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>1st over: New Zealand 0-0 (Latham 0, Conway 0) </strong>It will be interesting to see how Devon Conway bats here.

It’s not often that Kyle Jamieson goes for three boundaries in an over, not in Test cricket anyway. </p> <p>From the start of play to the arrival of the No11 Anderson, Burns scored 32 from 128 balls. Since then he has hit 28 from 15.</p> <p>“I’ve devoted quite a lot of time to mulling over the whole Robinson situation,” says Rob Wolf Petersen. “My view is that, ideally, the ECB would strike a balance between acknowledging the seriousness of the offence and recognising that it occurred a long time ago. I think a wise approach would be a fine, ban for a couple of Tests, and some form of meaningful engagement with the communities he disparaged, perhaps a combination of coaching and restorative-justice-style conversation, so he can understand the negative impact of his words and channel it into something positive.”</p> <p>I think that’s what will happen. I’ll be very surprised if he plays the second Test, which is important because it’s the last time this summer that the IPL bowlers will be unavailable. I suspect he’ll play at some stage next summer, but it’s not beyond the realms that he becomes the strangest of all one-Test wonders.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-06-05T14:50:32.236Z\">at 3.50pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-60bb8cd08f082ac930aeb36c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-05T14:43:13.576Z\">3.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>94th over: England 239-9 (Burns 107, Anderson 0) </strong>Burns celebrates his century by waving a full toss from Wagner down the ground for four.

Yes, those tweets were from an age ago but finding an effective way to hold him accountable is important – at the very least it sends a strong message that racism and sexism is inexcusable. Without holding people to account how else are we supposed to deter them? I am not sure standing back and letting boys be boys is the right way.

Sorry, this message had mutated into a ranting stream of consciousness; I’m going to have a lie down and a gin.” Ha. </p> <p>That’s a rant to relish, but perhaps putting a bit too much weight on the old career average.

Slow, slowish, quick, then quicker still, it all builds to the final act, the shoot-out on the fifth afternoon. Well, not this one. It has marched to the beat of a different drum: super-slow, super-quick, non-existent. Following yesterday’s wash-out, more than half the playing time has already elapsed, and we’ve only had an innings and a bit. The draw is such a hot favourite that if you decide to back it, you’ll have to shell out a tenner for every £3 you stand to win. </p> <p>If you are a betting person, the horse to back is surely New Zealand. Put a fiver on them and you could win £23. The rain, coming on top of Devon Conway’s dream debut, has left Kane Williamson in the driving seat. </p> <p>England, resuming on 111 for 2 and missing all their all-rounders (Stokes, Buttler, Woakes, Curran), could easily be bowled out for 250. That would take about half the day, leaving the other half for the New Zealanders to extend their lead.

There was an inside edge, so England are down to their last review. The ball pitched miles outside leg stump as well. That aside, he was plumb. ENGLAND REVIEW FOR LBW! Anderson implores Richard Kettleborough to give Conway out LBW. England have two reviews left - and Root chooses to go upstairs. He may soon regret that decision. 8th over: New Zealand 11-0 (Latham 3, Conway 7) Conway is having a torrid time. He survives a biggish LBW appeal from Broad, who doesn’t bother arguing for a review. Turns out it was umpire’s call on height. A flamingo flick brings Conway a single later in the over, and hints that he may have had enough of being a punchbag for Broad. The over ends with a clever offcutter from Broad that just misses the off stump as Latham offers no stroke. “Hello again Rob,” says Brad Mcmillan. “I sometimes wonder whether Brian would have been a more appropriate name for me, but I also wonder whether what little success I had with foreign girls on holiday as a teenager was because my name is actually Brad. Either way, I’ll forgive Guy Hornsby because he improved my original comment on Andy Zaltzman by mentioning the pun expertise and, well, because he’s Guy Hornsby.” Or Gary, as you should have called him. 7th over: New Zealand 10-0 (Latham 3, Conway 6) “After getting frustrated at England’s batting handing the initiative to New Zealand, I’m going to attempt to cheer myself up by jumping ship now, and watching Wales v Albania,” says Matt Dony. “I have a sneaking suspicion it might not be 100% successful. I’ll probably be back soon enough. And, whenever I do come back, I imagine Conway will be batting.” 6th over: New Zealand 8-0 (Latham 1, Conway 6) An LBW shout is caught in the throat when Conway gets a late inside-edge, and then he is rapped on the glove by another nasty delivery from Broad. He and Anderson have been superb with the new ball, reminding us that attack can be the best form of defence in the field. Latham and particularly Conway have a job on to survive, never mind score runs. ANOTHER REVIEW FOR CAUGHT BEHIND! Conway is beaten on the inside by a beauty from Broad, who thinks there might have been an inside edge. He persuades Joe Root to review, and those with experience of Stuart Broad and DRS will have an idea what happens next. Replays show Conway missed it by a long way, so this time England do lose a review. 5th over: New Zealand 8-0 (Latham 1, Conway 6) “Dearest Rob,” lies Mac Millings. “In light of your heartbreaking admission that Andy Zaltzman is ‘the man I dreamed of becoming’, please allow me to introduce my all-time Unfulfilled Promise XI: Rory Burnsout Cyril Washedup Has-been Hameed CouldaBeenAContender Sehwag David Capable Brett Likelee Lost Buttler Unfulfillip DeFreitas Prospect Utseya Prodigeetan Patel Graeme Hick LATHAM IS NOT OUT! Anderson got one to straighten sharply from round the wicket. Latham played across the line and there was a noise before the ball went through to Bracey. Joe Root reviewed with one second remaining, but replays showed the ball missed the outside edge and hit the back pad. It was actually very close to LBW, umpire’s call on point of contact, so England keep their review. ENGLAND REVIEW FOR CAUGHT BEHIND AGAINST LATHAM 4th over: New Zealand 5-0 (Latham 1, Conway 3) The new ball is doing plenty. Conway shoulders arms to a ball that lifts sharply and almost hits him in the armpit; then he is beaten, feeling for a lovely delivery that moves away off the seam. Conway nods respectfully at Broad. 3rd over: New Zealand 3-0 (Latham 0, Conway 2) Conway pulls his hand off the bat handle after being surprised by a bit of extra bounce, this time from Anderson. It’s been a quiet start to the innings, just three runs from three overs. “What’s the plan now for NZ?” says Ruth Purdue. “Assess the pitch a few overs and then tee off?” Yep, I guess so. This hasn’t been the easiest pitch on which to score quickly, though, so I don’t think it will be a sixfest. 2nd over: New Zealand 1-0 (Latham 0, Conway 1) Stuart Broad gets one to lift extravagantly outside Conway’s off stump. There have been enough hints of spin and uneven bounce to make New Zealand think they could force a fourth-innings collapse and win the game. “Hi Rob, from the 15:45 Leeds to Manchester,” says Guy Hornsby. “Can I vociferously second Brian McMillan? I’m a big Andy Zaltzman fan, ever since his early days of the brilliant Bugle, and I’ve been lucky enough to see him live a few times in stand-up. He’s a very quick wit (and a notorious punner), and his love for cricket - stats especially - is just the right side of unhealthy obsession. He often repeats the same line at gigs: ‘Any cricket fans in today? Stick your hands up.... Great. Anyone not like cricket?... What the f*** IS WRONG WITH YOU?” Still makes me laugh. What I love is that this really is his dream job, and he’s a stand-up, podcaster, hosts the News Quiz, but really this is what he was born to do. TMS is a cuddlier, funnier, more brilliant place with him in it. And that’s the best thing, really.” Agreed. In the last decade or two there has been a lot of talk about modernising TMS, yoofspeak and all that. Zaltzman had modernised it in a far subtler way, and without compromising the spirit of the thing. Zaltzman and Brian Johnston is one of the great fantasy commentary teams. 1st over: New Zealand 0-0 (Latham 0, Conway 0) It will be interesting to see how Devon Conway bats here. His 200 was a classical opener’s innings, but he also has a spectacular white-ball record so he has the ability to set up a declaration. For now Tom Latham is on strike to James Anderson, who starts with a maiden. The players are back on the field. There are still 37 overs to bowl today, so New Zealand should be well ahead by the close. “Hi Rob,” says Brad Mcmillan. “‘Twas indeed a great stat from Andy Zaltzman. I think it’s worth dwelling on him for a moment, not just to ponder his breathtaking stats-work, but his general passion for the game and, for my money, his perfection of the art of gallows humour. Appreciate his comedy isn’t for everyone, but he’s one of the quickest, funniest people I’ve ever heard, and there can surely be no doubt he’s been an absolutely brilliant addition to the BBC coverage.” As well as the one-liners and killer stats, there’s such an infectious joy to his work. He has redefined the role of the statto. Or, to put it another way, he’s the man I dreamed of becoming. Tea The innings break will today double up as a tea break. See you in 15 minutes. New Zealand lead by 103 runs They still have a chance of winning this game, and should be able to leave England with around 70 overs to survive tomorrow. It would have been a lot more but for that terrific innings from Rory Burns: 132 from 297 balls with 16 fours and one six. Tim Southee returns to the attack and needs only one ball to end the innings. Burns wafts outside off and gets a thin edge through to the keeper. He falls one short of his highest Test score, while Southee ends with admirable figures of six for 43. He’s a class act. In other news... 101st over: England 275-9 (Burns 132, Anderson 8) Anderson tries to reverse sweep Santner and almost drags the ball onto his stumps. Later in the over he hammers a long hop through the covers for four, which stirs the crowd and brings up an unlikely fifty partnership. This has been a fine comeback from 140 for six. “Is Burns the first England Test opener to score three centuries since Alastair Cook?” asks Tom van der Gucht. He is indeed. Compton, Sibley and Jennings all have two. 100th over: England 267-9 (Burns 130, Anderson 2) Still no pictures I’m afraid, but I can report that Burns a) survived a tight review for LBW and b) swept Wagner for six next ball. On an individual and team level, this really has been a mighty innings. Stat of the day, possibly the year 100th over: England 261-9 (Burns 124, Anderson 2) We’re having a few technical problems, apologies for that. I can’t be sure as the picture is coming and going, but I think New Zealand have just reviewed an LBW appeal against Rory Burns. It looked like it was missing leg. 99th over: England 261-9 (Burns 124, Anderson 2) Kane Williamson brings on Mitchell Santner to replace Kane Williamson. Anderson survives another over without too much trouble. This is the second irksome tenth-wicket partnership of the match after Devon Conway and Neil Wagner added 40 on the second day. “Wasn’t in your shift, but Tom van der Gucht’s Buttler rant might hold more weight if his career renaissance in Tests hadn’t started with some key defensive efforts against India (when Sam Curran got man of the series),” says Jimmy Ainsworth. “He showed real character, far more than England’s top order did today. And then bringing Bairstow into it... one of England’s greatest ODI batsmen for sure, but he’s spent the last three years in Tests moaning about not getting picked while forgetting where his stumps are. A lovely tribute act from poor James Bracey today, sadly.” I used to get in a tizz about Bairstow’s Test career, all that unfulfilled promise, but then I started to appreciate that England effectively swapped a good Test batsman for an all-time great one-day opener. It was a worthwhile trade. 98th over: England 261-9 (Burns 124, Anderson 2) Burns continues the post-century merriment, flicking Wagner over backward square for four. Since reaching his hundred he has scored 24 from 20 balls. 97th over: England 257-9 (Burns 120, Anderson 2) Kane Williamson brings himself into the attack, and starts with a dismal off-side wide. Burns misses a reverse sweep, with the ball slipping past Watling for a couple of byes, and then takes a single off the fifth ball. Anderson survives his one delivery without alarm. 96th over: England 253-9 (Burns 119, Anderson 2) Anderson elevates Wagner’s blood pressure with a jaunty shot behind square for two. He survives a full over, which means Burns will be on strike against Jamieson. England trail by 125. 95th over: England 251-9 (Burns 119, Anderson 0) Burns is letting his hair down. He pulls Jamieson for four, a sweetly timed stroke, steers another to third man and then laces a gorgeous cover drive to the fence. It’s not often that Kyle Jamieson goes for three boundaries in an over, not in Test cricket anyway. From the start of play to the arrival of the No11 Anderson, Burns scored 32 from 128 balls. Since then he has hit 28 from 15. “I’ve devoted quite a lot of time to mulling over the whole Robinson situation,” says Rob Wolf Petersen. “My view is that, ideally, the ECB would strike a balance between acknowledging the seriousness of the offence and recognising that it occurred a long time ago. I think a wise approach would be a fine, ban for a couple of Tests, and some form of meaningful engagement with the communities he disparaged, perhaps a combination of coaching and restorative-justice-style conversation, so he can understand the negative impact of his words and channel it into something positive.” I think that’s what will happen. I’ll be very surprised if he plays the second Test, which is important because it’s the last time this summer that the IPL bowlers will be unavailable. I suspect he’ll play at some stage next summer, but it’s not beyond the realms that he becomes the strangest of all one-Test wonders. 94th over: England 239-9 (Burns 107, Anderson 0) Burns celebrates his century by waving a full toss from Wagner down the ground for four. The speed with which the pecking order of the England batsmen changes is fascinating, especially as we’re in an Ashes year. Before this Test Burns was arguably 7th or 8th on the list; now he’s 3rd or 4th. That’s an outstanding effort from Burns on his return to the side. He edged Wagner to third man and pegged it back for a second. It’s his third Test century, his second against New Zealand, and it has ensured he won’t be the one missing out when Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler return. 93rd over: England 230-9 (Burns 98, Anderson 0) With Anderson at the crease, Burns decides it’s time to make a mad dash for his century. He cuts Jamieson for two then pulls the next ball for four. Burns was almost caught by the deep midwicket, who ran in and dived forward, but the ball bounced short and then went past him to the boundary. A single takes him to 98 and leaves Anderson with two balls to survive. He does. “I find myself like King Ethelred utterly unready to follow yet more forlorn English sporting pursuit of bang adequacy,” says Ian Copestake. “And then there’s these Test matches!” 92nd over: England 223-9 (Burns 91, Anderson 0) Burns has scored more slowly today - 32 from 128 balls. This is anything but a criticism - he and Ollie Robinson have taken some useful time out of the game. Neil Wagner vs Stuart Broad was never going to be dull. Broad pings a short ball from Wagner in the crowd - but he’s cleaned up by a fuller inswinger next ball. Wagner tests the burstability of his blood vessels, screaming with angry delight and clenching his fist towards Broad. 91st over: England 216-8 (Burns 90, Broad 4) Burns misses a hook at Jamieson, who has changed ends, and is clonked on the helmet for the second time since lunch and the fifth time in his Test career. That means a break in play for another concussion check, but he’s fine to continue. Burns then survives an optimistic shout after being hit in the box but an outswinger. Too high, probably pitched outside leg. A clip off the pads takes him into the nineties. Ashes department He’s batting at No3, which is a smart move if he wants to get back in the Test team. 90th over: England 214-8 (Burns 89, Broad 3) Neil Wagner replaces Jamieson, and his first over includes an LBW review and a dropped catch. Burns was the batter on both occasions. The LBW appeal was far too high but the catch should have been taken. Burns fenced a lifter to second slip, where Southee spilled a fairly sharp chance to his right. The ball deflected towards the first slip Ross Taylor, who threw out his left hand but couldn’t hold on. 89th over: England 212-8 (Burns 88, Broad 2) Thanks Tim, hello everyone. Burns inches closer to a hundred, pulling Southee’s first ball for a single, and that’s your lot. And with that, I’m handing over to the great Rob Smyth. Thanks for your company and correspondence, and sorry not to get round to all de emails about Bill Hargreaves’ XI. See you tomorrow. 88th over: England 211-8 (Burns 87, Broad 2) Broad hooks in the air, giving Burns a heart attack, but the ball lands safely. Meanwhile the Robinson debate continues. “Richard Horrocks’ take is somewhat short-sighted,” says Faradh Maharoof. “It’s a contradictory and convenient take to excuse bad behaviour. If the alternative is just a slap on the wrist, then how do we expect anyone to learn? Yes, those tweets were from an age ago but finding an effective way to hold him accountable is important – at the very least it sends a strong message that racism and sexism is inexcusable. Without holding people to account how else are we supposed to deter them? I am not sure standing back and letting boys be boys is the right way. Ollie was a young adult after all – and fully capable of making a judgement on what he was writing. And if he is really sorry and has really matured as an adult, why didn’t he apologise at any point over the past nine years before his England debut? “Giving people the chance to learn and grow is all well and good, but as the ECB and FIFA have shown us, it’s one thing to talk about learning from racism, and entirely another thing to hold people accountable and drive change. I’d bet one of those is better at deterring than the other.” 87th over: England 209-8 (Burns 86, Broad 1) Broad takes a quick single to get off the mark, which is more than a few others have managed in this innings. 86th over: England 208-8 (Burns 86, Broad 0) Jamieson now has 3 for 62, good stuff given that he struggled with the slope at first. He’s a very interesting bowler – halfway from Tony Greig to Courtney Walsh. 85th over: England 207-8 (Burns 86, Broad 0) Before the wicket, Burns showed that he wasn’t merely OK: that bang on the head seems to have brought back his timing, which had been missing for hours. He cracked Southee square for four to take England past 205, so this is now their highest score in eight Test innings. Mark Wood gets an inside edge, and England go back to collecting ducks. Southee has the taste for bouncers now and Burns ducks into one. It doesn’t look serious, he’s up and chatting, but the concussion checks need to be made, so the umpires call for drinks. The hour since lunch has belonged to England, but New Zealand are still well on top of the match. A bouncer, a hook, an easy catch at fine leg. Well bowled Southee, who has yet another five-for, and another line on the honours board. And well batted Ollie Robinson, who showed touches of class and bags of character. 83rd over: England 203-6 (Burns 82, Robinson 42) A single to each batsman off Jamieson. “Robinson and Archer on the same team?” says Repugned on Twitter. “Interesting nets.” Well, yes, if they didn’t already open the bowling together for Sussex. 82nd over: England 201-6 (Burns 81, Robinson 41) Burns, facing Southee, skies a pull, but gets away with it as the ball bisects two fielders and plops into the turf. A question from Nick Way. “Could Bill Hargreaves’ team also include La Buschagne?” 82nd over: England 200-6 (Burns 80, Robinson 41) Kyle Jamieson joins Southee, but he can’t make anything happen either on this slow pitch. Robinson, with his sensible head back on, waits for the bad ball and cuts it for four to bring up the 200. 81st over: England 195-6 (Burns 79, Robinson 37) Robinson is getting a bit cocky, dancing down the pitch to Southee, so the next ball is a bouncer, to sober him up. Southee finds some swing, as ever, but not the magic touch of this morning. 80th over: England 194-6 (Burns 78, Robinson 37) That’s bad luck on Santner, who will presumably not be seen for some time. It’s now time, and Tim, for the new ball. Meanwhile Geoffrey Smith picks up on Bill Hargreaves’ query about putting together an XI of players called de, D’ and so on. “Will Mike DeNness do?” Ha. Burns gives Santner the charge, misses, slips, hands BJ Watling several hours to get rid of him – and he fumbles it! 79th over: England 192-6 (Burns 77, Robinson 36) After doing the necessary, Robinson is beginning to relax. He eases Wagner past gully like Chris Woakes on a good day, then punches past cover like a proper batsman. That’s the fifty partnership, and Robinson is responsible for two-thirds of it. 78th over: England 183-6 (Burns 77, Robinson 27) A good ball from Santner, drifting in and turning away as Robinson pokes forward at thin air. But Robinson is showing us what a strong character he is – four wickets when Broad took none, 27 runs when several others got none, and most of it achieved under a big black cloud. He’ll probably be banned for the next Test, and rightly so, but he will be back and his grit, along with Jofra Archer’s elbow, could hold the key to the Ashes. Robinson chips Santner over mid-on and runs two, to get England over the line – but not yet out of the woods. 77th over: England 178-6 (Burns 76, Robinson 24) One of the two runs comes along right away, albeit in uncertain fashion, as Robinson flaps at Wagner’s stock ball – the bouncer. Burns plays and misses again, this time with a prod at a length ball that holds its line. One run to save the follow-on. Three overs to the new ball, which explains why we’ve been seeing the supporting cast. 76th over: England 177-6 (Burns 76, Robinson 23) Robinson flicks Santner to leg – and flicks short leg’s trouser leg, but safely, as whoever it is doesn’t have time to get his hands down to his shin. Burns then plays a sweep and misses, outside off. Two needed! 75th over: England 175-6 (Burns 75, Robinson 22) Wagner continues, and even he may be wondering why. There’s heavy cloud cover – get a swinger on. Burns takes a leg-bye and Robinson tries some nice decisive leaves. He’s about halfway to proving that England do have an allrounder after all. “Re Robinson,” says Daniel King, “surely people can see the disconnect between standing in a Moment of Unity with anti-discrimination shirts on, and having to explain remarks which – however long ago – are the absolute antithesis of what the ECB is trying to achieve right now.” 74th over: England 174-6 (Burns 75, Robinson 22) Kane Williamson, who usually knows what he’s doing, seems to be at sea here. He takes de Grandhomme off, which makes sense, but brings Mitch Santner on, rather than Jamieson. Robinson keeps him out. Five still needed to see off the follow-on. 73rd over: England 174-6 (Burns 75, Robinson 22) Wagner to Burns: nothing to report, except a certain amount of dogged inelegance. 72nd over: England 174-6 (Burns 75, Robinson 22) A no-ball and another single off de Grandhomme, who has also prompted a thought from Bill Hargreaves. “Can’t we get a team together with the likes of Colin de Grandhomme, Bryson Dehambeau, Basil D’Oliveira, Phil DeFreitas, et al? It could have been presided over by good old Phil de Greek, except that he’s now passed into the hands of Old Father Time.” Bill, you’re speaking my language. But I suspect we’ll need to let in people called du as well as de, De and D’. Come back, Faf du Plessis, your people need you. 71st over: England 172-6 (Burns 74, Robinson 22) From the Pavilion end it’s Wagner, who hasn’t found his mighty mojo yet. Burns takes yet another single with a prod to leg. Southee is believed to be off the field. “The cricketing world would be a less lively place,” says Abhijato Sensarma, “without the Kiwi bowling attack operating in it. There is something charming yet off-putting about them, isn’t there? Wagner, Southee, even the absentee Boult – they are the kind of killers who go around assassinating batters with a smile on their face. They’re not full-blooded pacers, but it’s nice to see a collective of their kind be charming on the field as well.” 70th over: England 171-6 (Burns 73, Robinson 22) Robinson takes advantage of Williamson’s generosity, cutting for four and again for two, which leaves only eight needed to save the follow-on. Not even England can mess that up, can they? The players are back from lunch, and the ball is in the hands of Colin de Grandhomme, which is a bonus for England. Maybe Southee’s exhausted. “Is it necessary,” asks Richard Horrocks, “to keep talking about Robinson’s tweets? I still have elderly grandparents who grew up in (and probably engaged with) very racist attitudes. Should that be dragged up too? Punishing the lad won’t deter anyone, it will just make it that much harder to connect with hearts and minds. This isn’t about judgement and punishment, but getting people to understand and giving them the chance to learn and grow. How we respond to Robinson now sends a message out to others about how they too will be received. Robinson has owned his mistake. Is that not enough?” Two interesting comments have come in on England’s predicament. “All those counties, all those posh schools and all those academies,” says Gary Naylor on Twitter, “and England end up with this top seven.” We could spend the whole afternoon unpacking that sentence. And here’s Tom van der Gucht. “Root did seem to be getting ahead of himself with his aim to win all this summer’s Tests.” You’re telling me – that was a textbook blunder. “Unfortunately, with the exception of a few players, England are a bit of a middling side at the moment. The bowling is looking to be picking up, but when you compare the batting line-up with 2010, it’s not fit to lace the drinks of Strauss, Cook, Trott, KP, Colly, Bell and Prior. Now, the team is packed with callow rookies. I know we’re lacking Stokes and Buttler, but then again is that a big loss?” Yes! “Buttler seems to have spent his entire Test career built on potential and what he could achieve. But how many times has he turned the game around in Tests? He’s played 50 matches and still trails in Prior’s wake in terms of contributions. In fact, he trails in Bairstow’s wake when you compare their records batting down the order and keeping... Sorry, this message had mutated into a ranting stream of consciousness; I’m going to have a lie down and a gin.” Ha. That’s a rant to relish, but perhaps putting a bit too much weight on the old career average. Not many batsmen have averaged more than 35 in England over the past three years, with the Dukes ball and the seaming surfaces. Stokes has been phenomenal, on and off, and Buttler has been immense lately – when not being rotated. 68th over: England 164-6 (Burns 72, Robinson 16) And that’s luncheon. Robinson has done well to steady the ship, after threatening to scupper it with those terrible tweets. And Burns is still there, albeit so becalmed that he’s being outscored by a bowler making his debut. Like his opposite number Devon Conway, Burns has seen a lot of partners come and go. So England still need 15 to avoid the follow-on. And the morning belongs to Tim Southee, who showed up a gauche middle order with a spell of exemplary swing bowling. See you in half an hour. Meanwhile, why not sign up to The Spin, if you don’t already. And Graham Hardcastle has the latest county news: It was off the pad only, as Robinson had realised. You wait ages for a mistake from Michael Gough, and then he makes two in one morning. Off the spinner, Santner, at short leg. He reviews straight away, so maybe it’s not out... 67th over: England 164-6 (Burns 72, Robinson 16) One more to each batsman as England continue to get ’em in singles. The partnership has crept to 24 and could really do with adding another 15. 66th over: England 162-6 (Burns 71, Robinson 15) Just a single off Jamieson as the cameras find a pair of small boys in T-shirts, with their dad, I presume. They must be about 9 and 11 and are busy with a scorebook, one filling it in, the other keeping a close eye on him. That was me and my brother Charlie, with our mum, when New Zealand came here in 1973. Be warned, lads: you may both become cricket writers, and one of you could end up on the OBO. 65th over: England 161-6 (Burns 70, Robinson 15) Burns nudges a single off Wagner, who is pitching it up rather than bombing him, presumably because the bombs can bring boundaries. “Whiffs of 80s and 90s nostalgia,” says Colum Fordham, “as England embark on a trademark collapse and try admirably to set up a New Zealand victory AGAINST ALL ODDS. Though writing from a surprisingly Lords-like overcast Naples, I just heard from my brother Kit in London who has been down to the graveyard with his young sons to play a bit of cricket (interesting location, I know, but apt). One of my nephews made a six and out. I’m sure he was influenced by England’s callow young middle-order batsmen. My brother has just opened another can of cider to ease the pain.” As emails go, that’s more of a novella. 64th over: England 160-6 (Burns 69, Robinson 15) Robinson gets a touch too confident, wafting at a lifter from Jamieson with the bat dangling at 45 degrees – neither one thing nor the other. He’s then beaten on the inside edge as Jamieson gets the shape back in with which he started the proceedings today. Still 19 needed to avoid the follow-on, and Robinson may have to get most of them – as Mike Atherton points out, Rory Burns has made only 10 this morning, off 60 balls. The wheel is there to be grabbed if he can manage it. 64th over: England 160-6 (Burns 69, Robinson 15) Here is Wagner, whose bowling in this game hasn’t been quite as hot as his batting. Robinson greets him with another good shot, a clip for three. “Can we talk,” says Tom King, “about that terrible Jet advert played between overs? It’s as if they’re trying to find the least crickety sound possible.” I’ll have to take your word for it, Tom. Between overs, I’m so busy stringing a sentence together, I wouldn’t hear a clap of thunder. 63rd over: England 157-6 (Burns 69, Robinson 12) So we do get a bowling change, but instead of Wagner for de Grandhomme, it’s Jamieson for Southee. His extra height induces a wacky shot from Robinson, who steps away and slashes over the slips for four. He thus becomes the fourth Englishman to reach double figures in this innings. To celebrate, he plays a much better stroke, a back-foot glide to cover point that deserves more than a single. Here endeth the masterclass. 62nd over: England 151-6 (Burns 69, Robinson 7) de Grandhomme goes back to joining the dots. Time for a burst of Neil Wagner, surely. 61st over: England 151-6 (Burns 69, Robinson 7) Williamson seems to have decided to bowl Southee all day long. For a change he tries a bouncer, which Burns pulls crisply but only for a single. In the commentary box are Ian Ward and Rob Key, and Ward is scoffing at Key’s ignorance of the fact that the Lord’s floodlights bob up and down (they’re up now, even though the sky is largely blue). Key takes it very genially, so the attempt at one-upmanship rather backfires. 60th over: England 150-6 (Burns 68, Robinson 7) de Grandhomme concedes a few singles, for once, so England make it to a minor milestone. They need another 29 to see off the possibility of the follow-on. Here’s Richard O’Hagan again. “I know that there’s a lot of 90s nostalgia around at the moment – music reviews, Euro 96 reviews and so on – but England being thrashed by NZ was one memory I really didn’t want to revisit.” 59th over: England 147-6 (Burns 67, Robinson 5) Robinson plays his first decent shot, a firm push down the ground off Southee, which is saved by a diving stop from Kane Williamson. If he’d thought about it, Williamson might have let it trickle for four, to give Southee a few more goes at Robinson. Southee could afford to concede the extra run: his spell now stands at 11-6-18-3, and it may have won the match. 58th over: England 143-6 (Burns 66, Robinson 2) Burns needs to get a move on, but de Grandhomme isn’t the bowler you’d choose for that scenario. He keeps it tight apart from a big fat no-ball. Burns has only five from his last 30 balls, so the question now is whether he can take charge. “Just done a team sprint triathlon in Leeds (I know I know, anything to get out of the house),” says Guy Hornsby. “Checked my phone after the finish to a flurry of notifications. I thought ‘it can’t be the cricket’ but... Of COURSE IT CAN. I know we’re keen on a result but.... Oh England.” 57th over: England 142-6 (Burns 66, Robinson 2) One debutant gives way to another as Ollie Robinson comes in. His first Test has been a right old rollercoaster – four wickets and one disgrace, albeit from years ago. And he nearly gets a golden duck, just saving himself from a big LBW shout by getting an inside edge. Robinson can bat, but he hasn’t shown it yet – he gets off the mark with a leaden-footed squirt through the slips. This is riveting. Another duck! Poor Bracey’s first Test innings comes to a miserable end as Southee bends one back up the slope and the bat goes some way down the wrong line. England have lost three for none in 21 balls. It’s a classic English collapse, and they still need 39 to avoid the follow-on. 56th over: England 140-5 (Burns 66, Bracey 0) Time for a bowling change, as Jamieson takes a breather and Colin de Mullet comes on. It’s a maiden from him to Burns, and that’s drinks, with New Zealand well on top. England’s grown-ups have been fine, making 108 runs for once out, while the kids are all wrong – Sibley 0, Crawley 2, Pope 22, Lawrence 0. These ducks and twos won’t do: if you’re going to struggle, at least stick around for half an hour. “You see,” says Richard O’Hagan, “this is why England picked a top-order batter at number 7. It all makes sense now.” 55th over: England 140-5 (Burns 66, Bracey 0) And here comes James Bracey, on debut. Facing the demon Southee, he leaves one that’s a little too close for comfort, then traps a full ball in the crease like a footballer. But he’s survived five balls, which is three more than Lawrence managed. Southee’s spell now: 9-6-11-2, Timmy with a strong whiff of Jimmy. Another one! Southee sends down a piece of sheer temptation, in the form of a full outswinger. And Lawrence takes the bait, giving Colin de Grandhomme, at third slip, a catch so simple that he could have held it in his mullet. 54th over: England 140-4 (Burns 66, Lawrence 0) Dan Lawrence has come in, but has only faced one ball so far. He is England’s sixth specialist batsman, something that hardly ever happened under Ed Smith – who is having rather a good game, as absent friends often do. 53rd over: England 140-4 (Burns 66, Lawrence 0) Great stuff from Southee, whose spell has been impeccable: 8-5-11-1. “I wonder,” says David Reynolds, “if any of your readers might know what ails the overseas TMS feed. To begin with, the Youtube page for Day 4 produced no sound, and now the link for it has disappeared from the BBC Cricket page. In the meantime, this Middlesex man is hoping for oodles of Surrey runs today.” Yes, he’s gone! It was a very plumb plumb, and Southee knew it. Gough is not God after all. And Pope’s promising innings turns out to be a mere cameo. The only reason to think this is not out is that Michael Gough said so, and he is hardly ever wrong. 52nd over: England 140-3 (Burns 66, Pope 22) A glance from Pope, so he gets down the other end, the better to decide who it is that Jamieson really resembles. And finally we have a commanding shot from Burns, clipping for four in front of square. He could do with a hundred here after six consecutive Tests of diddly squat. 51st over: England 135-3 (Burns 62, Pope 21) After that flurry of runs, Southee decides a maiden is required, and Burns obliges. “Jamieson just offered up one cheeky grin too many,” says Robert Cookson, “and I realised that he has more than a passing resemblance to a youthful Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson. I’m done for the day.” Kyle Jamieson thus becomes the first person ever to be likened to both B Johnson and R Redford in the same morning. 50th over: England 135-3 (Burns 62, Pope 21) Burns takes a single off Jamieson, and Pope clips a blameless ball square for four. Ebony Rainford-Brent heard him taking guard and asking for middle-and-off, which enables a shot like that – but if he misses, playing a ball on middle stump with half a bat, he’ll be plumb. Intriguing stuff. 49th over: England 130-3 (Burns 61, Pope 17) Pope, freed from the shackles of Jamieson, spots a half-volley from Southee and creams it to the extra-cover boundary. That’s the shot of the morning, not that the bar is a high one. And then it’s trumped by an on-drive off a pretty good ball, swinging out from middle-and-leg. Pope is moving the game along at a good lick, which is just what it needs. “Jamieson has something of the Tremlett about him, don’t you think?” says Kevin Wilson. “Not super quick, about Anderson or Broad pace, but he just looks huge! A lovely, flowing action too. Broad is the same height more or less but wouldn’t intimidate me half as much as Jamieson would.” Broad, right now, only intimidates coaches and people called Warner. But with a bit of luck he’ll see himself being written off and get 6 for 20 in the second innings. 48th over: England 122-3 (Burns 61, Pope 9) Another four to Pope, another thick edge off Jamieson, but with a bit more control this time. Then we get the first single of the day, as Pope nudges to fine leg. Burns, facing Jamieson for the first time, is turned around and slammed on the back pad. There’s a big appeal but the ump reckons it’s too high. Ooh – umpire’s call. On this evidence Jamieson is much like Ollie Robinson, but even more effective, because taller and that bit more experienced. 47th over: England 117-3 (Burns 61, Pope 4) With the ball moving sideways, Rory Burns – who does plenty of that himself – looks like a wicket waiting to happen. But he’s a fighter and he gets off the mark for the morning with a shovel for two off Southee. 46th over: England 115-3 (Burns 59, Pope 4) We have some runs! Four of them, to Ollie Pope, but off a thick edge – a bit of a grope from Pope. And next ball he plays and misses. How many do England need to avoid the follow-on? Another 60 or so. 45th over: England 111-3 (Burns 59, Pope 0) At the other end – running in from the Pavilion – it’s Tim Southee, and he too is swinging it round corners. Rory Burns does well to keep him out. The England players have a new word emblazoned on their chests: cinch, which is exactly what this isn’t. “Good morning,” says John Starbuck. “At this rate, we might get a man carrying his bat after all, if Burns can retain his poise and do the business.” 44th over: England 111-3 (Burns 59, Pope 0) That’s a wicket maiden and a fabulous start from Jamieson, who is finding big swing as well as steep bounce. And he looks like Robert Redford on stilts. It’s the first ball and ... Joe Root is caught at first slip! Slight doubt over whether the catch was clean, but it was - well held Ross Taylor, and well bowled Kyle Jamieson. The shot was the classic fend, off the back foot, and England have lost their only experienced batsman. The players are out there, and the sun is not – though there’s plenty of blue in the sky. There is a rhythm to a Test match, a classic structure. Slow, slowish, quick, then quicker still, it all builds to the final act, the shoot-out on the fifth afternoon. Well, not this one. It has marched to the beat of a different drum: super-slow, super-quick, non-existent. Following yesterday’s wash-out, more than half the playing time has already elapsed, and we’ve only had an innings and a bit. The draw is such a hot favourite that if you decide to back it, you’ll have to shell out a tenner for every £3 you stand to win. If you are a betting person, the horse to back is surely New Zealand. Put a fiver on them and you could win £23. The rain, coming on top of Devon Conway’s dream debut, has left Kane Williamson in the driving seat. England, resuming on 111 for 2 and missing all their all-rounders (Stokes, Buttler, Woakes, Curran), could easily be bowled out for 250. That would take about half the day, leaving the other half for the New Zealanders to extend their lead. They could rattle up 200 by noon tomorrow, to hand England a target of about 330 in 80 overs. In a parallel universe, England would race to 450, bowl NZ out for 160, and win by eight wickets. All Joe Root would have to do is make 180 and then grab one of his cheap five-fors. Stranger things have almost happened. Play starts at 11am, as ever – the extra eight overs in the day, if we get them, will be tacked on at the end. See you shortly.","charCount":"38851","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/robsmyth\">Rob Smyth</a> (now) and <a href=\"profile/timdelisle\">Tim de Lisle</a> (earlier)"},{"headline":"French Open 2021: Nadal beats Norrie, Krejcikova shocks Svitolina – live!","standfirst":"<ul><li>Latest updates from day seven at Roland Garros</li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/jun/04/yana-sizikova-arrested-at-french-open-tennis-in-match-fixing-investigation\">Sizikova arrested in match-fixing investigation</a></li><li>Get in touch! <a href=\"mailto:luke.mclaughlin.casual@theguardian.com\">Email Luke</a> or tweet <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LukeMcLaughlin\">@LukeMcLaughlin</a></li></ul>","trailText":"Join Luke McLaughlin as the third round continues in Paris, with Cam Norrie facing the unenviable task of stopping Rafa Nadal","byline":"Luke McLaughlin","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a7762fe3f3199aeb4e354bba33aa9acc358ecaf9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7762fe3f3199aeb4e354bba33aa9acc358ecaf9/386_596_3556_2134/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rafael Nadal celebrates beating Cameron Norri.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rafael Nadal celebrates beating Cameron Norri.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christophe Petit-Tesson/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<div id=\"block-60bba3018f08b9889b369eba\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-05T16:18:51.979Z\">5.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Nadal</strong> conducts an on-court interview: “It’s a pleasure for me to be back playing at Roland Garros, it doesn’t matter which court it is, it’s fantastic for me.</p> <p>“He [Norrie] is having the best season of his career, winning plenty of matches ... he’s won a lot of matches this year ... but I found a way to be through, that’s the most important thing for me ...

Nadal, the 13-times French Open champion, will go into battle later today against Cameron Norrie, the British No 2, while Djokovic takes on Ricardas Berankis of Lithuania and Federer meets the left-handed German Dominik Koepfer. </p> <p>British fans will be fascinated to see how Norrie gets on: he was impressively consistent in his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/jun/03/cameron-norrie-wins-at-french-open-to-set-up-potential-tennis-clash-with-rafael-nadal\">second-round win against Lloyd Harris</a>, but will he have the weapons to trouble the king of clay? We will find out from around 1.15pm.</p> <p>In the women’s competition, a few big names have admittedly fallen early: Naomi Osaka withdrew, sparking a global debate about mental health and media coverage which rumbles on, while Ash Barty, the world No 1, was forced to retire from the tournament with a hip injury. The reigning champion Iga Swiatek of Poland is still very much in contention, however, in ominous form, and is clearly feeling increasingly confident about a second title. Swiatek faces a potentially tricky tie against 30th seed Estonian Anett Kontaveit this afternoon, scheduled on court at 3pm. Barbora Krejcikova will be the opposition for Elina Svitolina (5) on Philippe-Chatrier from 11am, while the fourth seed Sofia Kenin meets her American compatriot Jessica Pegula on Court Suzanne Lenglen. Coco Gauff v Jennifer Brady is another all-American affair from 3.15pm.</p> <p>There is light cloud covering Paris at the moment but no rain is expected, and the sun is scheduled to peep through the clouds later in the day. Let’s get started!</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-06-05T09:15:01.822Z\">at 10.15am BST</time></p>  </div>","wordcount":"6024","firstPublicationDate":"2021-06-05T09:02:52Z","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2021-06-05T16:18:51Z","liveBloggingNow":"true","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/p/hktdb","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7762fe3f3199aeb4e354bba33aa9acc358ecaf9/386_596_3556_2134/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","isLive":"true","bodyText":"Nadal conducts an on-court interview: “It’s a pleasure for me to be back playing at Roland Garros, it doesn’t matter which court it is, it’s fantastic for me. “He [Norrie] is having the best season of his career, winning plenty of matches ... he’s won a lot of matches this year ... but I found a way to be through, that’s the most important thing for me ... I was able to win in straight sets, and that’s so important for me. “The last year and a half have been difficult for every player ... it’s because of my friends and family that I where I am today ... it’s so important that we’ve got the fans back, and hopefully the situation will keep improving.” That’s the 16th time Nadal has gone into the round of 16, which is as symmetrical as his 6-3, 6-3, 6-3 scoreline today. Norrie fought, and fought hard, but Nadal isn’t bad on clay, is he? The Spaniard eases into the last 16 as his title defence rolls on into the second week. The champion will take on Jannick Sinner in the next round. Norrie digs out a sublime angled winner after another power-packed baseline rally between the two men. Next up, he sends one fractionally long, and it’s a second match point for Nadal. And he converts! An email arrives from Sayyam Zahid: “I live in Karachi Pakistan and I follow your website these days thanks.” It’s a pleasure, Sayyam! Thanks for getting in touch - glad you’re enjoying the coverage. Norrie is raging against the dying of the light, and constructs a stunning point to go 0-15 ahead on Nadal’s serve. Norrie holds for 5-3! Nadal will serve for the match now, and his 32nd straight set win at Roland Garros. Match point for Nadal, the defending champ, against Norrie. He misjudges a double-handed backhand which clips the top of the net and flies out. It’s deuce. Swiatek’s moment of victory: Ons Jabeur is through! She’s beaten Magda Linette of Poland, 3-6, 6-0, 6-1. Nadal takes the game and it’s 5-2. Norrie is giving everything here and is competing admirably, but Nadal just has too much. Nadal v Norrie now stands at 4-2 to the Spaniard in the third. Norrie has forced a glimmer of a chance with 30-30 on Nadal’s serve: he takes full control of a point to try and force a chance for a break, but Nadal converts defence into attack with phenomenal determination and ability. He runs down a volley from Norrie and crunches a winner past his opponent. Maria Sakkari took the first set against Elise Mertens, 7-5. Mertens is now 4-3 and a break up in the second on Court Simonne Mathieu. Nadal is now up 4-1 in the third against Norrie, and speeding towards the finish line. Swiatek speaks: “She was playing really really fast from the beginning, she was dominating, I guess I had a ‘late’ start today. But I’m really happy, I had 0-2 against her [so far in her career], and I sort of broke that, so yeah, I’m really happy about that. “I’m really happy that I’m playing consistently, I’m trying to approach every game the same way, like I did last tear ... many players struggle when they come back after winning a Grand Slam - so I’m really happy that I’m able to handle it.” Asked how and why she always seems so relaxed and happy, Swiatek adds: “I guess I’m a good actress: everybody’s under pressure. I’m travelling with my sports psychologist and she helps me with that. I always thought the mental part of the game is really important, and I guess I’m ready for this kind of pressure.” Impressive all-round from the reigning champion. Imperious stuff from the women’s singles champion who was asked some tough questions by the Estonian and came up with all the answers. Kontaveit hit winner after winner in the first set - 31 in total in the match - but Swiatek steadied the ship and dominated the second set. She seems to have an ideal all-round game for Roland Garros, with powerful groundstrokes and incredible speed around the court. Swiatek will face Marta Kostyuk of Ukraine in the next round. A superb angled backhand helps to set up match point for Swiatek. Nadal leads Norrie 2-1 in the third. Kontaveit flops a forehand into the net, then sends another wide to gift another break to Swiatek. It’s 5-0. Swiatek will serve for the match. There was one particularly punishing second-serve return winner by Swiatek in that last game, which perhaps took a psychological toll on the Estonian. Swiatek jogs out on to court after a drink of water, and urges herself onwards: “Come on!” She is one game away. In the men’s singles earlier: Italy’s Jannik Sinner saw off Mikael Ymer of Sweden in straight sets, 6-1, 7-5, 6-3. Swiatek moves 4-0 to the good and is now, apparently, cruising into the last 16. It’s been imperious stuff from the champion following that early barrage by Kontaveit. Swiatek’s speed around the court is clearly superior to Kontaveit’s, but the Estonian’s impressive shot-making has been a huge factor in making this such an engaging match. Two break points for Swiatek ... Kontaveit double-faults and it’s 3-0 to the reigning Roland Garros champion from Poland. Kontaveit’s facial expression, courtesy of a trademark slow-motion replay from the TV director, says it all. Nadal produces a jaw-dropping pass to seal the second set against Norrie. He’s been tested here, there is no doubt about that, but he’s negotiating his way through it and is looking well set to march into the last 16. Kontaveit grabs a break point but wastes it with an attempted winner that’s just wide. Back to deuce. Swiatek finds a way - and moves 2-0 ahead in this second set. Such mental toughness in the face of an excellent display by Kontaveit. Nadal goes to 5-3, now verging on the second set and a commanding position against the British No 2. Kontaveit, meanwhile, drills another fantastic clean winner crosscourt, returning a Swiatek serve with interest. The two players have 42 winners between them which shows how commited they have both been to attacking. Swiatek whips a powerful backhand crosscourt to earn a break point. Next up, she’s all over Kontaveit’s second serve, and claims the point and the game, a potentially crucial early break of serve. Kontaveit knew that Swiatek would be a different proposition today - and that’s the way it’s turning out. Nadal now has another break point against Norrie ... and he gets it! Norrie directs a shot over narrowly over the baseline and it’s 4-3 Nadal in the second set. Nadal won the first set 6-3. Sakkari and Mertens move to 5-5, both with a break, in their first set. Sensational stuff from Swiatek, who takes the first set, 7-6 (7-4). Kontaveit had her on the ropes there but the 20-year-old battled her way back into the match. Swiatek has won 88% of points on her first serve. There were 23 winners for Kontaveit, to 13 for Swiatek! Nadal, meanwhile, holds serve for 3-3 in the second. It’s 6-3 in the tie-breaker and three set points for Swiatek. Kontaveit saves the first. Swiatek winds up three destructive backhands consecutively and simply bullies Kontaveit out of the point on the Estonian’s serve. She leads by two points in the tie-breaker, 4-2. She tries a forehand to the corner, and it’s just wide, but she will serve still a mini-break up. Sakkari (17th seed) and Mertens (14th seed) are 4-4 in their first set on Court Simonne Mathieu. Nadal breaks - that is four in a row - and it’s 3-2 to Norrie. This is some match. Kontaveit and Swiatek are into a tie-breaker for the first set. Nadal now has 0-40 on Norrie’s serve in this break-fest of a second set. Kontaveit and Swiatek at deuce, with the Estonian serving to stay in the first set. Nadal breaks back for 2-1 in the second set against Norrie ... but the Briton earns a break point in the next game ... and WOW! He takes on a big, big forehand winner down the line, on the run, and breaks straight back, for the third break in a row! Norrie leads 3-1, second set. That would have to be the best shot I’ve seen at this tournament. Swiatek holds for 5-6. Kontaveit must again serve to stay in the set. This is another superb match, with neither player taking a backward step, both players taking their shots on and hitting with maximum commitment. Swiatek is finding her feet - she climbs into a huge forehand, which is just far too hot for Kontaveit to hope to get back, although she does her best and finds the net. Swiatek aces next, only for her Estonian opponent to absolutely crush the next return of serve, crosscourt, for an emphatic statement of intent and to take it to deuce. Nadal’s won 30 straight sets in Paris. Madness. Kontaveit holds comfortably for 5-5 against Swiatek on Court Philippe-Chatrier. Fantastic from Norrie, who breaks Nadal to lead 2-0. He sends a forehand wide and Nadal can only direct his shot into the net. Chance for Norrie, meanwhile, at deuce on Nadal’s serve ... and he gets a break point! Swiatek has roared back into this first set. Kontaveit must summon the memories of the two times she’s already beaten her Polish opponent - although both those occasions were before Swiatek stepped up to the top level with victory here in Paris last year. Swiatek clips a stunning, curling pass down the line for 30-0 on her serve, 4-4 in the first. She follows that up by whipping a forehand crosscourt for 40-0, and closes out the love hold for 5-4 - Kontaveit must serve to stay in the first set. Norrie is on the board first in the second set against the 13-times champion Nadal. Swiatek has now won two break points against Kontaveit, but she overhits a backhand, and it’s 30-40 and 4-3 to the Estonian. Big point coming up ... and Swiatek breaks back! It’s 4-4. The champion is back in business. Kontaveit is now 4-2 to the good against Swiatek. Nadal, meanwhile, produces another comfortable hold and he takes the first set 6-3 in 36 minutes. A love hold for Norrie, rounded off with a very smart drop shot which plonks over the net perfectly. The crowd applauds appreciatively. It’s 5-3 and the British No 2 is in this match. Nadal is moving through the gears now. He holds serve with ease, rasping a forehand winner down the line, with Norrie in a different postcode over on the other side of the court. It’s 5-2. Nadal has Norrie under pressure at 15-40 on the Briton’s serve. Nadal sends a forehand wide, but Norrie still has a break point to save. He butchers a forehand into the net, and Nadal leads 4-2 in the first. Kontaveit holds her first service game, and creates a 2-0 lead against Swiatek. It’s 3-2 for Nadal now in the first against Norrie. Norrie holds for 2-2 and is competing admirably well so far. Kontaveit breaks the champion, Swiatek, in the first game of their third-round match on Court Philippe-Chatrier! History is made by Djokovic: Nadal opens up the court with a massive forehand and then comes in to the net to put a volley away - coming millimetres from touching the net - but he’s just ok. The Spaniard earns two game points, and finishes it emphatically with a crisp forehand down the line. He leads 2-1, and it’s with serve in the first set. An impressive opening service game from Norrie makes it 1-1 in the first set. Swiatek and Kontaveit are warming up. Top stuff from Norrie, living with Nadal blow-for blow in a 21-shot baseline rally, and winning it as Nadal fluffs a forehand long. Norrie took it to 0-30 on the Nadal serve, but the Spaniard hits back to hold serve for 1-0 in the first set. The power of one Nadal forehand, in particular, had Norrie shaking his head in wonder just then. A taste of things to come, you suspect. Nadal won the toss, and is serving in the first game of the match against Norrie. Iga Swiatek, the women’s champion, is about to begin her match against Anett Kontaveit. They have played twice before, and Kontaveit has won twice, but Swiatek is a different proposition since winning at Roland Garros last year. Thanks for holding the fort, Will. Nadal, the 13-times champ, has just strolled on to court to face the British No 2, Cameron Norrie. A relatively simple day out at Roland Garros for the Serbian. The fourth seeds makes it through in the end. Plenty of the favourites have already left the tournament, so Kenin will be feeling pretty confident about her chances now. Djokovic takes the first three games of the third set. I think we can safely say this one is over as a contest. Kenin goes 4-2 up in the deciding set against Pegula after saving a break point. Another man with a two-set lead is Novak Djokovic after he holds his serve to take the second. There was definitely more resistance from Berankis this time around but it was inevitable the Serb would win it. After a second set battle with Carlos Alcaraz, Jan-Lennard Struff wins it on a tie-break to go 2-0. The Spanish teenager, despite being down, looks like a fine player in the making. Berankis wins a service game to love but then Djokovic does the same to make it 5-3. Djokovic just a game away from taking the second set. Djokovic breaks and is now 3-2 up. I doubt he will allow Berankis back into this set. Another Djokovic hold and it’s 2-2. Now, Will Unwin is here to guide you through the next little while, as I go to assess what’s in the fridge. See you soon. In the women’s singles: Kenin (4) and Pegula (28), on Court Suzanne Lenglen, are now locked at one set all (6-4, 6-1) and playing a decider! In the men’s singles, meanwhile, Ymer is battling back against Sinner on Court 14. Sinner took the first set 6-1, now Ymer leads 5-3 in the second. Djokovic punishes himself for a sloppy error by repeatedly bashing the clay off one of his trainers with his racquet. Berankis now holds again, and this now does have the look of a competitive tennis match, rather than an exhibition laid on for the Serbian. Djokovic hits the shot of the match so far, a sumptuous back-handed winner from outside the tramlines which arrows down the line and bounces in the corner. Berankis can only watch, and admire, as it flies past him. And it’s a comfortable hold for the Serb, now 1-1 in the second set. Berankis leads 1-0, second set! That was a very tidy hold of serve by the 30-year-old. Djokovic still has the look of a man indulging in a relaxed Sunday morning hit-out at his local club, though. Djokovic takes the first set, 6-1, coming to the net and cushioning a smart drop volley that Berankis does not have a hope of reaching. The 2016 Roland Garros men’s singles champion is in total control. Berankis raises his level and fashions a couple of game points. Djokovic fires a powerful forehand winner for 40-30, but the Lithuanian volleys a winner on the next point, and he is on the board! It’s 5-1. Much better from Berankis, the world No 93. Djokovic storms into a 5-0 first-set lead against the hapless Ricardas Berankis. Can the Lithuanian find a way to establish himself in this match? He’s serving to try and stay in the set. This, in fact, is Musetti’s first Grand Slam. And he’s into the last 16. Great story, and clearly a very talented youngster: Djokovic crafts a well-judged double-handed backhand winner down the line for 4-0. One-way traffic, and then some ... Djokovic slices a crisp drop shot of his own now against the Lithuanian. Berankis can’t get it back. Break point for Djokovic to make it 4-0. Berankis tries a drop shot. Djokovic runs it down ludicrously easily, and pats it back over the net at an angle, with Berankis just standing on the baseline, watching the action from a distance. That sums up how one-sided it’s been so far ... Berankis winds up a big crosscourt winner during Djokovic’s next service game, but the Serb eventually holds comfortably enough, and creates a 3-0 lead in the first set. Regulation stuff so far. Straight off the bat - or indeed the racquet - Djokovic breaks Berankis, and leads 2-0 in the first set. The women’s champion, Iga Swiatek, is due on court at 3pm today for her match against Anett Kontaveit. Swiatek was in flying form against Rebecca Peterson in the second round, sweeping her opponent aside 6-1, 6-1, but has drawn attention to the fact that she’s already lost to Kontaveit twice, most recently at the Australian Open last year. You feel, however, that if Swiatek can maintain that level from the second round then she will progress. Djokovic holds, and he is on the board against Berankis. Cheeky from Musetti, very cheeky, in that match that just concluded: Straight into Djokovic v Berankis now, which is just starting on Philippe-Chatrier. Musetti is into the last 16 of a grand slam for the first time! Well done, well done. In truth, that final set wasn’t exactly a classic, but what a battle over five sets. Three more match points for Musetti ... Cecchinato holds - and saves three match points in the process! It is 5-3 now, and Lorenzo Musetti can have another bash at serving for the match. Djokovic, who is yet to drop a set in the tournament so far, is about to walk out on to court for his match against Ricardas Berankis. A beautifully sliced volley by Musetti, after he comes to the net, but Cecchinato manages to break and it’s 5-2 in the fifth. Musetti goes 5-1 up against Cecchinato! He will serve for the match, and a place in the last 16. Jannik Sinner is 3-1 up on Mikael Ymer on Court 14 in their first set. Now, over to Court 7, and this all-Italian five-set marathon between Cecchinato (ranked 83) and Musetti (ranked 76). Musetti, the 19-year-old, has just gone 4-1 up in this final set, so is in a commanding position. Krejcikova speaks: “I’m super happy ... I can’t really believe it. I’m so happy I was able to play my tennis, the game plan was working, I think most of my shots they’ve been actually amazing. This was, so far I think, my best match, I’m so happy that I’m here, that I’m enjoying the game, that I’m entertaining the crowd ... thank you so much for coming today. I’m just extremely happy.” Regarding that 21-minute hold of serve in the first set, at 4-3, she adds: “Every game is important ... especially against Elina because she is such a great fighter, it’s so hard to play against her so I think every single point actually counts. That game was for sure very important, I made it to the 5-3 and I was able to break her and take the first set.” Stunning! The world No 6 is out! What an accomplished performance that was by the Czech 25-year-old, who initially made her name as a doubles player. The world No 33 Krejcikova will face Sloane Stephens in the last 16. Two match points for Krejcikova! Svitolina crunches a backhand winner down the line to fight back to 15-15 in this crucial service game. Krejcikova is totally unflustered, though, and finds a lovely forehand winner in the next point after battling to control a baseline rally. Game point for Krejcikova to make it 5-2 vs Svitolina. And BOOM! She wins the game with a massive forehand after an indifferent forehand to the middle of the court by her opponent. Krejcikova is one game away from a resounding victory against the No 5 seed. Svitolina battles back to hold serve and it’s 4-2. The audio from Court 7 (Cecchinato v Musetti) is coming through on Eurosport’s coverage of Krejcikova v Svitolina, for some reason, but we’ll struggle on. We have the audio for the match on telly, too, so we’re doubling up. Krejcikova earns two break points. There is an exchange of slow, looping, high-bouncing shots from the baseline, before Svitolina moves in for the kill and smashes a forehand winner. And another forehand winner, and it’s deuce! Svitolina may be rattled by the form of her opponent but she’s battling on. In the men’s: Cecchinato and Musetti are engaged in a five-set epic now: 6-3, 4-6, 3-6, 6-4, 0-0. Krejcikova holds for 4-1. Can Svitolina find something - anything - to stop Krejcikova’s seemingly relentless progress towards the last 16? Krejcikova just needs to hold serve and she’s through. Another break for Barbora Krejcikova! It’s 3-1 and she is crushing the ball all over the court now - mixing it up with the odd drop shot - and Svitolina seems to have little answer. Svitolina breaks back for 2-1! The Ukrainian isn’t going to go down without a fight. Now, to Court Philippe-Chatrier, where a shock is brewing: Barbora Krejcikova of the Czech Republic is 2-0 up against fifth seed Elina Svitolina in the second set, after winning the first set 6-3. The first set featured a 20-minute service game for Krejcikova which she eventually held. She has hit 30 winners so far. Cédric Pioline, on post-match interview duty, tells the 10th seed Schwartzman that the crowd love him. “It’s a very special place to me,” Schwartzman tells Pioline of his feelings for Roland Garros as the cheers ring out. “I’m very happy to be back, to play my best tennis again, and with a crowd. Last year was my best tournament here, but not many people could come [due to lockdown] and I’m very happy to play with a lot of people here this week. “I was thinking to play every single point, as many shots I can ... he [Kohlschreiber] was not playing a lot of tournaments since last year ... so I was thinking to play a long match ... at the end, he was not running very well. “Now we can have time to walk around Paris this afternoon. I’m very happy, because now I have two days [off] before the second week here in Paris. Everything is perfect right now.” The diminutive Argentinian smokes a forehand down the line, and seals an utterly dominant win against the 37-year-old German. Schwartzman, the Argentinian, is 5-1 up in his third set against Kohlschreiber on Court Suzanne Lenglen. He angles a beautiful cushioned volley across court, and a point later, he has his first match point ... he sends the ball long, though, and it’s back to deuce on Kohlschreiber’s serve. That was a very, very entertaining two hours of tennis. Muchova sends a forehand long and Stephens is through with a top-drawer performance. Can the 2018 runner-up do something special this year? Stephens gives Muchova a smile as they shake hands - and then a big round of applause as the Czech leaves the court. A great spirit between the players - and a fine display of hitting from both of them. Muchova hits a blinding forehand winner. Stephens answers straight back, and has two match points. Stephens speeds to 30-0 and is two points away from the last 16 ... Stephens breaks! 6-5 to the resurgent American now, and she can serve for the match. Schwartzman is now 3-1 up against Kohlschreiber and seemingly easing to a straight-sets win. Stephens v Muchova is a much more interesting spectacle. Lovely variation now from Stephens, who produces a drop shot of her own: Muchova sprints and gets it back, but Stephens clumps a confident volleyed winner back into the open court. She now has three break points! Stephens holds for 5-5. Krejcikova and Svitolina are playing a marathon first set - it’s 4-3 there at the moment, Krejcikova with the second break and serving for 5-3. Whoah! Fantastic forehand winner down the line, on the slide, from Muchova and she creates a sniff of a chance at 40-30 on the Stephens serve. And now she takes it to deuce with another excellently-judged drop shot. Another classy drop shot from Muchova early in this service game from Stephens. But Stephens moves to 40-15 with a tremendous, powerful forehand that Muchova - attacking the net - cannot get back. Muchova digs out the game for 5-4. It’s been excellent from both players, this match. And that is a really gritty and calm effort from Muchova to fight back from 15-40 down and take the game - and, effectively, stay alive in the tournament. Muchova wins a game point, but a fine, deep return from Stephens forces an error and we’re back to deuce. Muchova forces it back to deuce after a long rally! Very, very impressive. Neither player held back there, despite the importance of the point. Stephens eventually sends a forehand wide and Muchova has parity. Now, two break points for Stephens after a couple of errors from Muchova. Muchova saves the first and it’s 30-40. Huge point coming up, can Stephens break again? Krejcikova and Svitolina are level at 3-3 in their first set, both with a break. Now Muchova, showing plenty of fight, forces a break point and she gets it! She’s broken back for 4-4 in the second set, and Stephens has more work to do. Now a break point for Stephens against Muchova! Muchova can’t afford to lose this point. But she does, directing a backhand into the net. Stephens is well set now, a break up once again, 4-3 in the second set, already a set to the good. Schwartzman is two sets up now against Kohlschreiber: 6-4, 6-2. Musetti, meanwhile, has hit back to level at 1-1 in sets against Cecchinato: 6-3, 4-6. If you missed it, here is a news story from yesterday regarding the arrest of the Russian player, Yana Sizikova, over allegations of spot-fixing in last year’s French Open: It’s 3-3! Stephens holds serve to draw level in the second set. Muchova has tightened up her game and is making life much tougher for Stephens now. The American puts a backhand into the net for deuce in the sixth game of the second set. Following a washout at Lord’s yesterday, it’s game on in St John’s Wood this morning in the first England v New Zealand Test match. Tim de Lisle is covering the action here: It’s been extremely high-quality tennis here, so much so, it’s a big surprise when Muchova tamely finds the net with a backhand from the baseline. That makes it 30-30 and it’s a chance for Stephens: but now the American puts a shot of her own into the net from the back of the court for 40-30 to Muchova. Muchova closes out the game and it’s 3-2 to the Czech in the second set. Muchova now advances to the net and produced a lovely angled drop, then smacks a backhanded winner for 30-0. She’s on top right now. Stephens answers back, dispatching a fine backhand winner on a short ball. She’s done it! Stephens chases down a drop shot, opening up the right of the court, and Muchova passes to break back! Great point, and a great game. It’s 2-2 in the second set and Muchova is back in it! Muchova is noticeably timing the ball a lot better in the last few games, really starting to get a feel for it. Muchova gets it wrong again. She’s had four break points so far in this match and converted none of them. Now, here’s a fifth ... can she do it? Now, a chance for Muchova to break back ... she gains advantage on Stephens’ serve, but then inexplicably sends a forehand well wide. But next up, Muchova digs out a stunning volley at the net for another break point! On Court Philippe-Chatrier, the fifth seed Svitolina has started her match against Krejcikova. Schwartzman leads Kohlschreiber 3-1 in their second set (the Argentinian also won the first set, 6-4), while Musetti is 4-3 up on Cecchinato in that second set. A perfectly-judged drop shot from Muchova and she’s on the board in the second set, at 2-1 to Stephens. Stephens has fallen down the rankings of late - according to the commentators, in fact, she won just four matches throughout the whole of 2020 - but this performance has been well above her current ranking of 59 in the world. Muchova hasn’t played badly but Stephens has exerted control with every area of her game. Stephens holds comfortably for 2-0 in the second set. Muchova is very much second best here. Muchova has won just one out of 11 points when she’s come to the net, so she probably needs to rethink that tactic. Muchova sends a forehand long, after another entertaining rally, to seal a Stephens break at the start of the first set! Trouble for Muchova. Schwartzman wins the first set against Kohlschreiber, 6-4. Stephens wins the first set, 6-3! This has been a really interesting and engaging contest: Muchova has been mixing things up with a few clever drop shots, but Stephens has generally been in the ascendancy, taking every advantage with her accomplished forehand and showing ability to dictate the terms of many of the rallies from the baseline. Muchova moves to 40-0 on her serve, including a drop shot that flicks off the net cord (Muchova raising a hand by way of apology), and a lob which Stephens decided not to play but drops just inside the tramlines. Muchova then seals a love hold with another drop shot - and the American Stephens will serve for the first set at 5-3. Schwartzman is really making Kohlschreiber work to hold serve in that first set, but the German finally does it, and it’s 5-4 to the Argentinian who will try to serve it out now. Cecchinato wins his first set against Musetti, 6-3. The Stephens forehand is causing Muchova plenty of issues. The American earns a second advantage - and wins the game when the Czech sends a volley long. The umpire gets out of his seat and jogs to the back of the court to check the mark, raises his finger in confirmation, and it’s 5-2 to Stephens in this very engaging first set. Muchova takes it deuce on Stephens’ serve. Muchova then wins a break point with a fine, powerful forehand into the corner on her opponent’s backhand side. But Stephens then saves the break point with a big forehand of her own which Muchova can only dump in the net. On court, Stephens and Muchova both hold serve, and it’s 4-2 in the first set. Kohlschreiber is serving to stay in the first set against Schwartman at 3-5. Sloane Stephens has had a terribly tough year, having lost two grandparents and an aunt to Covid-19, and has said that she wishes she had attended her grandparents’ funeral instead of being in isolation ahead of the Australian Open: “I should have asked to go to my grandparents’ funeral,” she told the New York Times earlier this week. “I should have made those inquiries and seen if I could get out of the bubble and go home. I didn’t. It’s something that I’ll probably regret for the rest of my life, because I prioritized my tennis over things that were happening in my life. The only thing I can do now is move on and move forward. There’s nothing wrong with having a therapist or two and a grief counselor and all of these things. I have to do what’s best for me and work on myself.” Schwartzman has broken Kohlschreiber, to go 4-2 up, and now Stephens breaks Muchova for 3-1 in the first set! Elsewhere in the men’s singles, Marco Cecchinato is 4-2 up on Lorenzo Musetti on Court 7. Stephens wins a break point with a lovely sliced backhand down the line. Muchova saves it with a delicate (and brave) drop shot - a much better effort than her previous one. Stephens is seeing it - and hitting it - remarkably well. She wrests control of a rally with a booming backhand, crosscourt, and finishes off the point in style. She is dictating the terms more often than not. Schwartzman and Kohlschreiber are under way on Suzanne Lenglen and it’s 2-2 in the first set. Stephens wins four points in a row to hold her second service game, and it’s 2-1 in the American’s favour against Muchova. Muchova finally manages to hold: she had to work for that, and this is shaping up to be a closely-fought - and very entertaining - affair. 1-1. Muchova tries a drop shot for the first time but Stephens runs it down easily and puts away a forehand winner. Back to deuce. Muchova is now having to work to hold her first service game. Stephens takes it to deuce after a marathon rally, both players hitting wonderfully well early in this match. Muchova grabs advantage, but Stephens stays aliver with an excellent forehand on to Muchova’s toes as the Czech comes forward, and she can only direct it into the net. Sloane Stephens holds serve against Karolina Muchova to begin their third-round match. It was an interesting first game, with both players hitting the ball sweetly and powerfully. Muchova produced one brilliant clean backhanded winner on Stephens’ second serve, but Stephens generally had the best of the rallies and she is on the board in solid style. Here is Tumaini Carayol’s report from yesterday, including Serena Williams’ win against Danielle Collins, as well as Aryna Sabalenka’s defeat by Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova: Sloane Stephens v Karolina Muchova (seeded 18) is first up on Court Simonne Mathieu, a match I will focus on to begin with. I’ll bring you live scores from across the other courts, of course. If you have any thoughts on the day’s action, you can drop me an email or tweet @LukeMcLaughlin. As the days tick by at Roland Garros and the field thins out, the big guns are naturally becoming more noticeable in the order of play: the men’s singles today sees Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal take to the clay for their third-round matches. Nadal, the 13-times French Open champion, will go into battle later today against Cameron Norrie, the British No 2, while Djokovic takes on Ricardas Berankis of Lithuania and Federer meets the left-handed German Dominik Koepfer. British fans will be fascinated to see how Norrie gets on: he was impressively consistent in his second-round win against Lloyd Harris, but will he have the weapons to trouble the king of clay? We will find out from around 1.15pm. In the women’s competition, a few big names have admittedly fallen early: Naomi Osaka withdrew, sparking a global debate about mental health and media coverage which rumbles on, while Ash Barty, the world No 1, was forced to retire from the tournament with a hip injury. The reigning champion Iga Swiatek of Poland is still very much in contention, however, in ominous form, and is clearly feeling increasingly confident about a second title. Swiatek faces a potentially tricky tie against 30th seed Estonian Anett Kontaveit this afternoon, scheduled on court at 3pm. Barbora Krejcikova will be the opposition for Elina Svitolina (5) on Philippe-Chatrier from 11am, while the fourth seed Sofia Kenin meets her American compatriot Jessica Pegula on Court Suzanne Lenglen. Coco Gauff v Jennifer Brady is another all-American affair from 3.15pm. There is light cloud covering Paris at the moment but no rain is expected, and the sun is scheduled to peep through the clouds later in the day.

Instead, for the first time since 2004, O’Brien will rely on a single runner – Bolshoi Ballet, the favourite - just as he did two decades ago when Galileo, Bolshoi Ballet’s sire, gave him the first of his record eight victories in the Classic.</p> <p>It could be pointed out that Meath, O’Brien’s only runner 17 years ago, finished last of the 14 runners, was subsequently gelded and then sold to race in Hong Kong. The parallels between Saturday’s market leader and his sire, though, are more compelling, not least the fact that both horses were impressive winners of the Derrinstown Derby Trial in May.</p> <p>Bolshoi Ballet hammered his stable companion Lough Derg by six lengths at Leopardstown, with today’s opponents Mac Swiney and Southern Lights even further adrift in fourth and fifth. The time was decent and Mac Swiney – who suffered from a nasal discharge for several days afterwards – recovered in time to frank the form with a victory in the Irish 2,000 Guineas next time.</p> <p>Whether the Leopardstown form is good enough to make Bolshoi Ballet a worthy 11-8 favourite on Saturday is a different question, as the Lingfield Derby Trial (won by Third Realm), the Chester Vase (Youth Spirit) and the Dante – won by the unbeaten Hurricane Lane – all had convincing winners and were run in respectable times.</p> <p>Bolshoi Ballet’s price also implies a fair degree of confidence that he will improve for the step up to 12 furlongs but the style of his trial success – he was in front with well over three furlongs to run and quickened clear two out – means that it is not necessarily a given. The rain at Epsom on Friday, which had changed the going to good-to-soft by mid-afternoon, adds to the uncertainty.<br></p> <p>On balance, and unless his price drifts abruptly, Bolshoi Ballet looks worth opposing with an each-way alternative, with both Hurricane Lane and Mac Swiney being the most obvious candidates with the form and potential to make them plausible winners.<br></p> <p>Mac Swiney’s odds began to contract as the ground eased on Friday but 6-1 is still a fair price for a colt who had enough class to land a Guineas last time but will surely be better still at 12 furlongs.<br></p> <p>Marginal preference, though, is for <strong>Hurricane Lane </strong>at around 8-1 – a surprising price for an unbeaten Dante winner who reached top gear only in the closing stages at York. Charlie Appleby’s colt has progressed with every run and could find plenty more improvement for the step up in trip on just the fourth start of his career.<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60bb90df8f08b9889b369dc0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-05T15:02:08.547Z\">4.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>He’s just on ITV and have to say that Michael Tabor, one of the Coolmore backers and owners behind the famous Aidan O’Brien yard, always looks like his top hat is too big. <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/345580971377984547/\">Freddie ‘Parrot Face’ Davies </a>(one for the youngsters) has nothing on Michael.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/itvracing/status/1401198255766216704\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&quot;The Epsom Derby will always be the number one derby, it is the race to win, especially for Coolmore.&quot;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/MCYeeehaaa?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@MCYeeehaaa</a> spoke to Bolshoi Ballet&#39;s co-owner Michael Tabor <a href=\"https://t.co/p5cM5HipJs\">pic.twitter.com/p5cM5HipJs</a></p>&mdash; ITV Racing (@itvracing) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/itvracing/status/1401198255766216704?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 5, 2021</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-06-05T15:25:55.268Z\">at 4.25pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-60bb8fec8f082ac930aeb399\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-05T14:56:54.333Z\">3.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Now the Racing TV bods are saying the ground appears to have dried out to ‘good’ after studying the time taken to run the five furlongs in the Dash at Epsom .

William Haggas had made no secret of the fact he thinks the Shadwell-owned colt is not at his best on rain-softened ground, and following the significant downfall at Epsom on Friday, the going was officially described as good to soft for the premier Classic.</p> <p>Haggas subsequently believed it best to sidestep the race with Mohaafeth, who is unbeaten in three starts so far this term, and instead point towards the Royal meeting with the Frankel colt.</p> <p>He told ITV Racing: “It was a decision that was left essentially, by Sheikha Hissa [of Shadwell Stud, the owners], to me, and I have never felt the horse is comfortable on soft, dead ground. It’s not soft, but it is dead and I don’t really want to run in a race I don’t think I can win.</p> <p>“I’m very grateful for the support. I’m sure it’s right, but we’ll never know if it’s right or wrong. We all want to win the Derby, every owner, jockey and trainer wants to win the Derby, but we want to have a fighting chance.</p> <p>“This is a young horse with a lot of potential and he’s got a lot more to offer, so I think it will be a bump in the road running him. So yes, it’s sad, but in a way I’m relieved.” <strong>PA Media</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7b9c19dac7078bd460a3331507d069838d8b9f5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b9c19dac7078bd460a3331507d069838d8b9f5d/46_364_2817_1691/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mohaafeth ridden by jockey Jim Crowley to win at Newmarket in May.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mohaafeth ridden by jockey Jim Crowley to win at Newmarket in May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Walton/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-06-05T14:31:43.308Z\">at 3.31pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-60bb886e8f082e80569f720e\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-05T14:22:46.015Z\">3.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">World Pool 'Dash' Handicap (3.45pm) betting</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <ul> <li>Sunday Sovereign – 7/2</li> <li>Stone of Destiny – 5/1</li> <li>Copper Knight – 7/1 </li> <li>Mondammej – 7/1</li> <li>Only Spoofing – 17/2</li> <li>Recon Mission – 12/1</li> <li>Lord Riddiford – 12/1</li> <li>Han Solo Berger – 18/1</li> <li>Ornate – 18/1</li> <li>Blue De Vega – 22/1</li> <li>Exalted Angel – 22/1</li> <li>Duke of Firenze – 22/1</li> <li>Get Boosting – 33/1</li> <li>Pettochside – 33/1</li> <li>Mokaati – 33/1</li> <li>Saaheq – 35/1</li> <li>Full betting on <a href=\"https://www.oddschecker.com/horse-racing/epsom-downs/15:45/winner\">Oddschecker</a></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"63ddc6513a0099f6f1537855b87c403aaa328bb4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63ddc6513a0099f6f1537855b87c403aaa328bb4/0_279_8214_4927/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A racegoer looks on during day two of the Cazoo Derby Festival at Epsom.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A racegoer looks on during day two of the Cazoo Derby Festival at Epsom.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-06-05T14:24:13.506Z\">at 3.24pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-60bb87fe8f082e80569f7209\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/gregwood\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-05T14:21:02.805Z\">3.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">World Pool 'Dash' Handicap (3.45pm) preview</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The “Dash” is the traditional curtain-raiser for the Derby and as ever, you could back half the field and still fail to find one that makes the first three. There is blazing speed across the track, with <strong>Sunday Sovereign</strong> looking a likely leader on the stands’ side from stall 19 while <strong>Ornate </strong>– a previous winner - should give them a good tow further out on the track from six. </p> <p>The drying ground could make it a little more likely that the pace will hold up, but there are several interesting “closers” to pick from if you would rather sit and suffer as they look for a way through, with <strong>Mondammej </strong>and <strong>Stone Of Destiny </strong>the most obvious candidates for a last-gasp success. The hopeful pick is <strong>RECON MISSION, </strong>with the excellent Ray Dawson taking off 3lb in the saddle, as his win over track and trip in April put down a very solid marker for today’s unique test. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8452e2fd362dd5372480d34c214da06030cc6ef5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8452e2fd362dd5372480d34c214da06030cc6ef5/0_119_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Racegoers look on as Oh This Is Us is ridden by Tom Marquand to victory at Epsom.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Racegoers look on as Oh This Is Us is ridden by Tom Marquand to victory at Epsom.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Action Images/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-06-05T14:25:39.595Z\">at 3.25pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-60bb87c98f082ac930aeb319\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-05T14:19:28.109Z\">3.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a7aed05e1c20d6c9628088be67ec53539deaff11\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7aed05e1c20d6c9628088be67ec53539deaff11/0_245_3634_2180/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Someone in the Simon Cowell party has backed the winner ... or just seen the bill for lunch!\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Someone in the Simon Cowell party has backed the winner ... or just seen the bill for lunch!</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Facundo Arrizabalaga/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60bb86da8f08b9889b369d29\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-05T14:15:54.973Z\">3.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Diomed Stakes (3.10pm) result</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>1 <strong>Oh This Is Us</strong> (Tom Marquand) 18-1<br>2 <strong>Century Dream </strong>(James Doyle) 2-1 Jt Fav<br>3<strong> B</strong><strong>ell Rock</strong> (Oisin Murphy) 2-1 Jt Fav<br>7 ran<br>Also: 11-2 Duke Of Hazzard 4th<br>Non Runners: 7,9</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60bb86318f08b9889b369d23\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-05T14:12:49.683Z\">3.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Diomed Stakes (3.10pm)</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And they’re off ...

The new market leader has the benefit of course form, having shown improved form on his return to action to win a handicap over an extended mile here at the April meeting. He is stepping up in trip today and is 7lb higher in the weights for a one-length success, but that race has produced several subsequent winners and the drying ground is also in his favour.</p> <p>King Frankel will be a stern opponent, however, having run four lengths second to Bay Bridge in the London Gold Cup at Newbury last time, a contest that has been won by a future Pattern-race winner in five of the last six seasons. Bay Bridge looked very much up to the usual standard of winner and while King Frankel is 6lb higher, his mark still looks a little on the low. At bigger prices, <strong>Freak Out </strong>is also worth a second look, as the form of his second at Newmarket last time is also working out well even if the step up in trip is not certain to suit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7e6b2f4b2e1c43135c48d708cc4207ff2059e83f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e6b2f4b2e1c43135c48d708cc4207ff2059e83f/0_66_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A member of the Red Devils Parachute display team lands onto the course during day two of the Derby Festival at Epsom.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A member of the Red Devils Parachute display team lands onto the course during day two of the Derby Festival at Epsom.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Walton/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60bb6ac58f082ac930aeb1cb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-05T12:27:10.158Z\">1.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Elie Lambert, who lives in Deauville in a studio apartment overlooking the racecourse, and who in his time was racing correspondent for Paris-Turf and the former Sporting Life, has an exhibition <a href=\"https://www.osg.uk.com/exhibitions/elie-lambert2021/\">at the Osborne Gallery in London’s West End</a> from June 14th to July 3rd.

It was dry overnight, though, and the blue skies over the downs are hopefully here for the duration of the day’s racing, which will mean a slow but steady drying of the surface as the afternoon goes on.</p> <p><strong>The Derby itself is at 4.30pm BST</strong>, by which time the track may be riding closer to good than the current good-to-soft, and while Bolshoi Ballet remains a rock-solid favourite at around 11-8, there is some jostling for position immediately behind Aidan O’Brien’s colt in the market.</p> <p>Mac Swiney, who won the Irish 2,000 Guineas on testing ground last time out, was a clear second-favourite at 6-1 after Friday’s rain but is now out to 9-1 as nothing more has arrived overnight. That could be an over-reaction, though, as Bolger told me earlier this week – in a quote that did not make <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/jun/04/jim-bolger-mac-swiney-epsom-derby-horse-racing\">the final cut</a> – that he has no concerns about his runner needing easy ground to be at his best.</p> <p>“The conditions played into his hands because of his stamina,” Bolger said, “but I don’t believe it has anything to do with a liking for soft ground.

Late betting news: One Ruler has been backed into 8-1 and Adayar is a springer, into 16-1 from 40-1. Bolshoi Ballet is solid at 11-8. John Leeper is sweating up and Frankie Dettori has borrowed a towel to wipe down his horse as he gets nearer the start. The great jockey is leaving nothing to chance.

Youth Spirit a little warm between his back legs as he heads to post ... has not got any warmer than in the paddock so not boiling over as he goes down to the start ... I remember when all Group One races, including the Derby, had a proper parade in racecard order before the start ... obviously in the Covid age it’s not a priority but it should be when life is back to somewhere near normal ... John Leeper throwing his head around a little bit and he’s extremely keen to post and Frankie Dettori will need to calm him down before the start as this runner can run with the choke out in the early stages. Our spies at the track say ‘no negatives’ for the Derby runners in the paddock with Youth Spirit the only one getting a little bit edgy. Simon Cowell just told Matt Chapman on ITV that “racing is his second passion”. With his earnings some trainers should be pricking up their ears. Bolshoi Ballet – 11/8 Hurricane Lane – 6/1 Mac Swiney – 13/2 John Leeper – 8/1 One Ruler – 11/1 Third Realm – 12/1 Youth Spirit - 25/1 Southern Lights – 33/1 Gear Up – 40/1 Adyar – 50/1 Mojo Star - 80/1 Full betting at Oddschecker A little over a week ago, a report suggested that Aidan O’Brien could send as many as eight colts to Epsom Downs for Saturday’s Cazoo Derby. Instead, for the first time since 2004, O’Brien will rely on a single runner – Bolshoi Ballet, the favourite - just as he did two decades ago when Galileo, Bolshoi Ballet’s sire, gave him the first of his record eight victories in the Classic. It could be pointed out that Meath, O’Brien’s only runner 17 years ago, finished last of the 14 runners, was subsequently gelded and then sold to race in Hong Kong. The parallels between Saturday’s market leader and his sire, though, are more compelling, not least the fact that both horses were impressive winners of the Derrinstown Derby Trial in May. Bolshoi Ballet hammered his stable companion Lough Derg by six lengths at Leopardstown, with today’s opponents Mac Swiney and Southern Lights even further adrift in fourth and fifth. The time was decent and Mac Swiney – who suffered from a nasal discharge for several days afterwards – recovered in time to frank the form with a victory in the Irish 2,000 Guineas next time. Whether the Leopardstown form is good enough to make Bolshoi Ballet a worthy 11-8 favourite on Saturday is a different question, as the Lingfield Derby Trial (won by Third Realm), the Chester Vase (Youth Spirit) and the Dante – won by the unbeaten Hurricane Lane – all had convincing winners and were run in respectable times. Bolshoi Ballet’s price also implies a fair degree of confidence that he will improve for the step up to 12 furlongs but the style of his trial success – he was in front with well over three furlongs to run and quickened clear two out – means that it is not necessarily a given. The rain at Epsom on Friday, which had changed the going to good-to-soft by mid-afternoon, adds to the uncertainty. On balance, and unless his price drifts abruptly, Bolshoi Ballet looks worth opposing with an each-way alternative, with both Hurricane Lane and Mac Swiney being the most obvious candidates with the form and potential to make them plausible winners. Mac Swiney’s odds began to contract as the ground eased on Friday but 6-1 is still a fair price for a colt who had enough class to land a Guineas last time but will surely be better still at 12 furlongs. Marginal preference, though, is for Hurricane Lane at around 8-1 – a surprising price for an unbeaten Dante winner who reached top gear only in the closing stages at York. Charlie Appleby’s colt has progressed with every run and could find plenty more improvement for the step up in trip on just the fourth start of his career. He’s just on ITV and have to say that Michael Tabor, one of the Coolmore backers and owners behind the famous Aidan O’Brien yard, always looks like his top hat is too big. Freddie ‘Parrot Face’ Davies (one for the youngsters) has nothing on Michael. Now the Racing TV bods are saying the ground appears to have dried out to ‘good’ after studying the time taken to run the five furlongs in the Dash at Epsom . We’ll keep you posted with any more views but there will be plenty of “no excuses on account of the ground” comments between now and when the 11 runners set off in the Derby at 4.30pm 1 Mokaatil (David Egan) 25-1 2 Only Spoofing (Tom Marquand) 13-2 3 Stone Of Destiny (S De Sousa) 5-1 4 Mondammej (Cam Hardie) 6-1 16 ran Also: 9-2 Fav Copper Knight Non Runners: 4,5,12,14 And they’re off ... Copper Knight got out with a blast and leads ... Son And Sannie now takes the lead ... Mokaatil bursts through and kicks away to win with plenty in hand. Easy! He’s not wrong (and you can follow all the action from Royal Ascot with us here on the live Guardian racing blog) ... Late 3.45pm preview update: Sunday Sovereign is now a non-runner in the next race, the “Dash” sprint handicap down one of the fastest five-furlong courses in the world. This could prove to be quite significant, since it was as certain as these things can ever be that Tim Easterby’s gelding would set a strong pace down the stands’ side from stall 19. Copper Knight (in 16) and Only Spoofing (20) now look like the most obvious pace-setters from the high numbers, while Ornate (6), who made all the running to win from stall two in 2019, is likely to lead overall assuming he makes his customary fast start. The favourite Sunday Sovereign is a non-runner in the ‘Dash’ (3.45pm) Mohaafeth will head to Royal Ascot after being taken out of the Cazoo Derby due to ground conditions at Epsom. William Haggas had made no secret of the fact he thinks the Shadwell-owned colt is not at his best on rain-softened ground, and following the significant downfall at Epsom on Friday, the going was officially described as good to soft for the premier Classic. Haggas subsequently believed it best to sidestep the race with Mohaafeth, who is unbeaten in three starts so far this term, and instead point towards the Royal meeting with the Frankel colt. He told ITV Racing: “It was a decision that was left essentially, by Sheikha Hissa [of Shadwell Stud, the owners], to me, and I have never felt the horse is comfortable on soft, dead ground. It’s not soft, but it is dead and I don’t really want to run in a race I don’t think I can win. “I’m very grateful for the support. I’m sure it’s right, but we’ll never know if it’s right or wrong. We all want to win the Derby, every owner, jockey and trainer wants to win the Derby, but we want to have a fighting chance. “This is a young horse with a lot of potential and he’s got a lot more to offer, so I think it will be a bump in the road running him. So yes, it’s sad, but in a way I’m relieved.” PA Media Sunday Sovereign – 7/2 Stone of Destiny – 5/1 Copper Knight – 7/1 Mondammej – 7/1 Only Spoofing – 17/2 Recon Mission – 12/1 Lord Riddiford – 12/1 Han Solo Berger – 18/1 Ornate – 18/1 Blue De Vega – 22/1 Exalted Angel – 22/1 Duke of Firenze – 22/1 Get Boosting – 33/1 Pettochside – 33/1 Mokaati – 33/1 Saaheq – 35/1 Full betting on Oddschecker The “Dash” is the traditional curtain-raiser for the Derby and as ever, you could back half the field and still fail to find one that makes the first three. There is blazing speed across the track, with Sunday Sovereign looking a likely leader on the stands’ side from stall 19 while Ornate – a previous winner - should give them a good tow further out on the track from six. The drying ground could make it a little more likely that the pace will hold up, but there are several interesting “closers” to pick from if you would rather sit and suffer as they look for a way through, with Mondammej and Stone Of Destiny the most obvious candidates for a last-gasp success. The hopeful pick is RECON MISSION, with the excellent Ray Dawson taking off 3lb in the saddle, as his win over track and trip in April put down a very solid marker for today’s unique test. 1 Oh This Is Us (Tom Marquand) 18-1 2 Century Dream (James Doyle) 2-1 Jt Fav 3 Bell Rock (Oisin Murphy) 2-1 Jt Fav 7 ran Also: 11-2 Duke Of Hazzard 4th Non Runners: 7,9 And they’re off ... Marie’s Diamond leads early ... Century Dream is up there ... Bell Rock is there ... Duke of Hazzard cannot get through ... Oh This Is Us and Century Dream went past together in a race that Frankie Dettori on Duke Of Hazzard will want to forget after being trapped on the rail when going well at the time. Expert time watchers conforming the ground is still good to soft ... and the fact that the going hasn’t dried to good is the reason Mohaafeth has been pulled out off the Derby. Newmarket trainer William Haggas has just revealed on ITV Racing that the fourth favourite, Mohaafeth, is out of the Derby. Haggas said he didn’t believe the horse would be suited by the softish ground. Haggas told @itvracing: “After lots of soul searching and discussion – and my god, we’ve had some – we have decided to scratch and go to [Royal] Ascot.” Century Dream – 9/4 Bell Rock – 5/2 Duke of Hazzard – 9/2 Maries Diamond – 15/2 Escobar – 10/1 Oh This is Us – 14/1 Pholas – 35/1 Full betting at Oddschecker Another race that has suffered from a couple of scratchings after Friday’s rain, with two very live contenders in Maximal and Prince Eiji now non-runners. That could leave the way open for CENTURY DREAM to land this Group Three for the third time in four years – although last year’s renewal was switched to Newbury - and while his reappearance run in the Lockinge at Newbury did not exactly scream “winning in waiting”, he looked a natural at the track on the way to his victory in 2018. Bell Rock, the second-favourite, is making his Epsom debut but has an obvious chance on the form of his win at Newmarket in May if he handles the twists and turns, while another dependable veteran, Oh This Is Us, would have a squeak on his very best form but has yet to register a win at anything above Listed level. 1 Parent’s Prayer (Oisin Murphy) 4-1 2 Nazuna (Andrea Atzeni) 15-2 3 Statement (David Egan) 7-4 Fav 8 ran Also: 14-1 Tomorrow’s Dream 4th Non Runners: 4,7 And they’re off ... Nazuna and Parent’s Prayer get off to a fast start ... with Lottie Marie up there too ... Parent’s Prayer has the lead now at Tattenham Corner ... Statement is trying to catch up on the outside but Parent’s Prayer is clear and never looked like being caught. Easy! Statement – 9/4 Nazuna - 9/2 Parents Prayer – 9/2 Maamora – 12/1 Lottie Marie – 16/1 Tomorrows Dream – 16/1 Queen Kahula – 25/1 Thank You Next – 33/1 Full betting at Oddschecker Two non-runners have reduced the field to eight runners but this is still a competitive Group Three, in which STATEMENT will attempt to get off the mark for the season after finishing six lengths behind Mother Earth in the 1,000 Guineas at Newmarket. The concern for favourite backers is that the Classic was her first attempt at a mile and today’s trip is a little further still, but the drop in class is significant and a repeat of her run to finish a close second in the Fred Darling in April would make her tough to beat. She is not the only runner dropping back from the highest level, however, as Nazuna was last seen finishing 10th of 14 in the Grade One Breeders’ Cup Juvenile Fillies’ Turf in November, having previously run the very useful Isabella Giles to two lengths in the Rockfel at Newmarket. Maamora, the probable pacemaker, could also have quite an easy time of it in front and needs to be considered, while Parent’s Prayer also has snippets of form last year that would give her a chance. Epsom Downs 2.00 1 Solent Gateway (Hayley Turner) 28-1 2 King Frankel (B A Curtis) 5-2 3 Greatgadian (S De Sousa) 5-1 7 ran Also: 15-8 Fav Patient Dream 4th Non Runners: 4,7 And they’re off ... Zhang Fei leads and King Frankel is being pushed along early ... the ‘King’ is last and not looking happy ... Zhange leads and King Zain is second and King Frankel looks awful ... Patient Dream is hemmed in and King Xain with Greatgadian goes clear with King Frankel coming late and Solent Gateway may have got up! What a finish! Frankie Dettori was down at the start for the first race and somebody shouted: “Where’s your horse!” The Italian doesn’t have a ride in the opener at Epsom but explained to ITV Racing why he was there ... “I like to walk the track on Derby day!” Of John Leeper, he said: “He has got low mileage but might lack a bit of experience - it’s an open Derby and I’m going to give it my best shot.” King Frankel – 5/2 Patient Dream – 5/2 Greatgadian – 6/1 Freak Out – 6/1 Zhang Fei – 11/1 King Zain – 14/1 Solent Gateway – 20/1 Full betting at Oddschecker A tricky little handicap to open the Derby card, and an uneasy former favourite in KING FRANKEL, who was top-priced at 5-2 overnight but is out to 11-4 in the face of strong support for Patient Dream (9-4 from 9-2). The new market leader has the benefit of course form, having shown improved form on his return to action to win a handicap over an extended mile here at the April meeting. He is stepping up in trip today and is 7lb higher in the weights for a one-length success, but that race has produced several subsequent winners and the drying ground is also in his favour. King Frankel will be a stern opponent, however, having run four lengths second to Bay Bridge in the London Gold Cup at Newbury last time, a contest that has been won by a future Pattern-race winner in five of the last six seasons. Bay Bridge looked very much up to the usual standard of winner and while King Frankel is 6lb higher, his mark still looks a little on the low. At bigger prices, Freak Out is also worth a second look, as the form of his second at Newmarket last time is also working out well even if the step up in trip is not certain to suit. Elie Lambert, who lives in Deauville in a studio apartment overlooking the racecourse, and who in his time was racing correspondent for Paris-Turf and the former Sporting Life, has an exhibition at the Osborne Gallery in London’s West End from June 14th to July 3rd. The artists who have influenced his work are interesting in their variety from the more traditional iconic Sir Alfred Munnings to David Hockney and Jack Butler Yeats. I love this painting of the William Haggas string at Newmarket, and the trainer will be hoping for a winner in the Derby with 9-1 shot Mohaafeth. Frankie Dettori has taken over the mantle of Lester Piggott (whose mount back in the day was labelled in what would now not pass muster the ‘housewives choice’). Everyone wants to know who he’s riding, many want to back him and the pre-Derby run-up usually involves another jockey being “jocked off”, as was the case this year when he switched to today’s ride, John Leeper, after Aidan O’Brien decide to have only one runner. That’s even truer after the jockey’s amazing Oaks victory yesterday. Ladbrokes spokesperson Nicola McGeady reports: “The horse we do not want to win is John Leeper, with Frankie fans praying he lands a Classic double.” You can still find some 10-1 but ‘the Leeper’ is down to 17-2 with SkyBet. A spokesperson from BritishGambler.co.uk stated: “John Leeper in the last 24 hours has taken 19% of bets, which is a fair amount and shows that punters are looking from someone to take on the favourite Bolshoi Ballet. A Frankie win would be any bookmaker’s worst nightmare as payouts will be over and above what they’d expected.” Hurricane Lane is the other attracting cash, now as short as 5-1 with some firms, having been as big as 8-1 on Friday night. Some of you will be having a go at the ITV7 or backing in other races at Epsom. Here are your non-runners with Caspian Prince, who won the race in 2014, 2016 and 2017, a significant absentee in the ‘Dash’ Stakes at 3.45pm due to the going: Epsom non-runners 2.00 4 Camelot Tales (going) 2.35 4 Posted (going), 7 Illykato (going) 3.10 9 Maximal (going), 7 Prince Eiji (going) 3.45 5 Caspian Prince (going), 12 Rose Hip (going) 5.15 1 Lost Eden (going), 6 Koeman (going) 5.50 1 Danzeno (going), 6 Justanotherbottle (temperature), Canagat (going), 12 Open Wide (going), 14 Indian Sounds (going) Tips are always flying around for the biggest day in the Flat racing year and everyone is usually interested in the Amato pub selection at the famous Epsom wishing well. Of course the tipsters at that particular watering hole have a long losing run to overcome ... Not jealous at all ... The British weather has been notoriously changeable this spring and yesterday’s atrocious conditions when Snowfall sluiced through the rain-softened ground to record a record Oaks-winning distance have given way to brilliant sunshine and we seem set fair for a blazing afternoon at Epsom. The official going is good-to-soft now but it could be good by the time of the Derby as Greg, who is there, has pointed out. Greetings from the home of the Derby, where what is sure to be the second-lowest attendance in the Classic’s history – 4,000 spectators – is starting to gather for the 242nd running of the world’s most famous Flat race. And what a splendid day it is after the unexpectedly damp experience that was Oaks day 2021, an afternoon that was immeasurably brightened by Snowfall’s 16-length romp in the fillies’ Classic but which also saw the going change from good, good-to-firm in places to good-to-soft all over after 11.8mm of rain. The forecast was for around 3-4mm, which was particularly unfortunate as Andrew Cooper, the clerk of the course, had been watering the track earlier in the week in case it went the other way. It was dry overnight, though, and the blue skies over the downs are hopefully here for the duration of the day’s racing, which will mean a slow but steady drying of the surface as the afternoon goes on. The Derby itself is at 4.30pm BST, by which time the track may be riding closer to good than the current good-to-soft, and while Bolshoi Ballet remains a rock-solid favourite at around 11-8, there is some jostling for position immediately behind Aidan O’Brien’s colt in the market. Mac Swiney, who won the Irish 2,000 Guineas on testing ground last time out, was a clear second-favourite at 6-1 after Friday’s rain but is now out to 9-1 as nothing more has arrived overnight. That could be an over-reaction, though, as Bolger told me earlier this week – in a quote that did not make the final cut – that he has no concerns about his runner needing easy ground to be at his best. “The conditions played into his hands because of his stamina,” Bolger said, “but I don’t believe it has anything to do with a liking for soft ground. He handles it very well, but before he ever ran we were always regarding him as a good ground horse and nobody was more surprised than I was when we found that he handles soft ground so well.” Hurricane Lane, the unbeaten winner of the Dante Stakes at York last month, has replaced Mac Swiney as second-favourite at a current top price of 6-1, while the lightly-raced “dark” horses Mohaafeth and John Leeper are out to 9-1 and 10-1. There are several potential history-makers connected to runners in the 12-strong field, including Aidan O’Brien, who would become the most successful trainer in the British Classics if Bolshoi Ballet obliges the punters and gives him a 41st success (and ninth in the Derby). Bolger, meanwhile, would be the oldest Derby-winning trainer at 79 years of age (as far as anyone can tell, at any rate, as records are a little sketchy in the race’s earlier years), and Ed Dunlop would become the first trainer to saddle a Derby winner named after his dad if John Leeper puts his name on a list which also includes Shirley Heights (1978) and Erhaab (1994), who were saddled by his namesake. And while it would not be entirely unique, Joseph O’Brien would become the first person to win a Derby as both a trainer and jockey since Harry Wragg in 1961 if the outsider Southern Lights pulls off a shock. His colt was only sixth behind Bolshoi Ballet in the Derrinstown last time but had all sorts of trouble in running there and should not be dismissed out of hand. It is one of the great days in world racing, the crowd is back – well, a bit of a crowd, at least – and the race itself returns to the first Saturday in June after being bounced into July 11 months ago. You can follow all the action here as it unfolds, and back or rule out my picks for the TV races as you please.

That would keep them in the hunt for a top-two finish in Group One. Looking at the scores there, it would seem to be a proper, hard-fought Championship win. Yorkshire are all out for 558, a lead of 245 with 23 overs remaining in the day. Jamie Atkins finished with 5-98, a career best in only his third game. At New Road, Worcestershire lead Durham by 78 with one second-innings wicket remaining. Their 329-9, includes 126 for opener Jake Libby. Ollie Robinson (the other one) has scored a quick-fire 120 not out off 118 balls for Kent against Northants. They are 161-0 after 35 overs in reply to Northants 392. Wonder whether a game may be set up there after the rain yesterday and the delay earlier. Kent have nothing to lose at the foot of the Group Three table, and Northants could do with a win. Wouldn’t rule it out. Here, Yorkshire are 544-8, leading by 231 with best part of 29 overs remaining. Jamie Atkins has taken four wickets for Sussex and bowled nicely. The leaders have been beaten by an innings at Leicestershire, their second defeat in two games. Callum Parkinson claimed 10-108 in the match. Cat firmly amongst the pigeons in Group Two. Warwickshire have won for the fourth time in eight games this season and are top of Group One after eight games. They have completed a win over Derbyshire at the County Ground, bowling the hosts out for 117 in their second innings thanks largely to Oliver Hannon-Dalby’s 4-24. Warwickshire and Leicestershire are closing in on three-days wins over Derbyshire and Gloucestershire, respectively. The latter two counties are both eight down in the second innings and still millions behind. Callum Parkinson has taken five wickets in the second innings for Leicester after doing so in the first. His first two five-fors in first-class cricket. A highly impressive young cricketer. Seamer Emily Arlott has taken a hat-trick for the Central Sparks as they defend a target of 225 against champions Southern Vipers at Hove. They are 42-5. Incredible. Malan is bowled by Jack Carson and misses out on becoming the first Yorkshire batsman to score double hundreds in two consecutive innings. Yorkshire 459-6, leading by 146. That is also the second time in Malan’s career he’s been out on 199. Derbyshire are 85-5 needing another 224 more to beat Warwickshire at the County Ground. Looks pretty unlikely, doesn’t it. Olivier Hannon-Dalby has taken three of the wickets. Here at Headingley, Dawid Malan is 188 not out and chasing back-to-back double centuries for Yorkshire. His first was in the Bob Willis Trophy last August. 444-5 and a lead of 131 over Sussex. Essex 21-3 in reply to Nottinghamshire’s 293 at Chelmsford. Brett Hutton has taken two, including Sir Alastair caught behind for five. And the Northern Diamonds have beaten Sunrisers by nine wickets in the RHF Trophy at Fenner’s chasing only 54. Bit of a thumping that. Sorry, no, a lot of a thumping! Northamptonshire, in a scramble for a fifth batting bonus point, have fallen short of 400 against Kent at Canterbury, losing their last five wickets for 30 to slip from 362-5 to 392 out. Guess who’s taken five? Yep, Darren Stevens. Unbelievable. Marnus Labuschagne talking to the ECB Reporters Network after top-scoring with 63 in the second innings of Glamorgan’s win over Lancashire. Particularly interesting about the reverse swing ... “This morning, it was key for us not to lose back-to-back wickets. I think losing one was alright, but we needed to make sure that we consolidated and built a partnership. We were only two 20 to 30-run partnerships away from winning. It was nice to be out there for the winning runs. To do it the fourth innings when the ball has gone reverse, which is exciting to play against because it is something we don’t get much of in Australia in domestic cricket - to get through that period and to build a partnership with Chris Cooke to get to the end, was very satisfying.” Jeez, he looks a classy player. This is actually the first time Yorkshire fans have seen him in the flesh since he joined from Middlesex in late 2019. He has two 150 plus scores in four four-day matches for the county. 381-4. Play due to start at 1.10pm at Canterbury. Just up the road at Chelmsford, Nottinghamshire have moved to 293-9 in their first innings against Essex in the other game which saw no play due to rain yesterday. At New Road, Worcestershire are 159-5 in their second innings trailing Durham by 91. Jake Libby continues his excellent summer, however, with 78. Dawid Malan is 146 here at Headingley and batting in cruise control. Yorkshire 374-3. I don’t think I ever batted in second gear during a dodgy league career around the north west, never mind cruise control! You have to laugh. The only remaining unbeaten record in county cricket has disappeared. And the result was flashed up on the scoreboard here at Headingley, where cheers and claps rung out. Yorkshire 340-3 in the 92nd over, with Dawid Malan on 123 not out. Labuschagne, by the way, finished 63 not out. Derbyshire are chasing 309 to beat Warwickshire at the County Ground and thus claim their first win of the season at the eighth attempt. They have bowled the visitors out for 155 second time around this morning, with South African seamer Michael Cohen claiming five wickets. Glamorgan need eight to win with six wickets left. Be some collapse to blow it from there! Crikey, must be soggy at Canterbury. Further inspection at 12pm. Glamorgan nearly there – 168-4, needing 20 more. Marnus Labuschagne’s 46 not out represents a season’s best. Nothing for Joe Root and co to worry about this winter, hey! Gloucestershire 23-3 in their second innings at Grace Road, still trailing Leicestershire by 270. And Hampshire are 311 all out at Taunton, trailing by 49. Josh Davey finished with five-for. Plenty of wickets around the traps. Lewis McManus missed out on a hundred at Taunton, where Hampshire are 307-9 in their first innings, trailing by 53. In the Rachael Heyhoe Flint Trophy, Katherine Brunt has struck three times for the Northern Diamonds at Fenner’s. Sunrisers are 16-5. Early wicket at Cardiff. Luke Wood has just got Kiran Carlson caught behind. Glamorgan 153-4, needing 35. There’s also been a wicket at Headingley. Gary Ballance caught behind off the impressive off-spin of Jack Carson for 77. 280-3 in the 79th over. There will be a delayed start at Canterbury due to damp conditions following yesterday’s torrential rain. Thankfully, play is up and running everywhere else, including at Lord’s, where England have lost Joe Root early – 111-3. Initial eyes are focused towards Cardiff. Glamorgan 143-3, needing 45 more. Labuschagne there on 36. His highest score of the season so far is 44. Jonny Bairstow is at Headingley this morning. He has netted and done some running with Yorkshire’s strength and conditioning coach, Pete Sim. Bairstow is due to make a handful of appearances for Yorkshire in the Vitality Blast, which gets under way for them here on Thursday against Birmingham Bears. That game, if selected, will also be Tim Bresnan’s first appearance against Yorkshire since leaving them last summer. It’s shorts weather for the second day running at Headingley, a far cry from the snow which greeted us eight weeks ago today when Yorkshire faced Glamorgan in the season opener. I think I wore three jumpers that day and two coats – sat inside! Tanya, I seem to remember, even went out at lunch and took orders for hot water bottles from the local B&amp;M Bargains or Poundland. Anyway, I apologise for the early digression. Here, yesterday, was a day to long remember as Sussex’s debutant Dan Ibrahim became the youngest player to score a fifty in Championship history, aged 16 and 299 days. He looked the real deal in front of a near-2,000 crowd. His composure really stood out before he struck with his medium pacers as Yorkshire slipped to 95-2 in reply to 313. Unfortunately, things got much harder for the young buck and his mates as Dawid Malan and Gary Ballance shared an unbroken 177 and will resume this morning looking to put a young attack on the ropes from 272-2. Malan (103) brought up a serene century in the final over the day and Ballance has 74. If Yorkshire can complete victory, it is likely to put them back within a handful of points of Group Three leaders Lancashire, who are on course for defeat in a quite remarkable game at Glamorgan. On what Alex Davies has described as a “substandard” pitch, Glamorgan are 137-3 needing 50 more to win with Marnus Labuschagne unbeaten on 32. The only remaining unbeaten record in county cricket this summer looks set to disappear. Mind you, get Marnus out immediately this morning and it could be different. Given the weather up North, I was absolutely staggered to see no play in the Test at Lord’s and also at Canterbury and Chelmsford in the Championship yesterday. When play does resume, Northamptonshire will be 362-5 against Kent in the other Group Three fixture and Notts will be 248-6 against Essex in the Group One top-of-the-table clash. Worcestershire have it all to do in Group One at New Road against an emerging Durham; 151 behind with seven wickets remaining and Jake Libby 51 not out. Likewise for Derbyshire at the County Ground against Warwickshire. The Bears, at 132-7 in their second innings, lead by 285. Derby will have to post the highest score of the match to claim victory. In Group Two at Taunton, it’s relatively even between Somerset (360) and Hampshire (285-7). I’d just rather be Somerset, but Hampshire have Lewis McManus unbeaten on 91 chasing his second career hundred. Gloucestershire’s popular and profitable start to the season is in danger of coming to a juddering halt. Beaten by Surrey last week, they are on course for a second away defeat at Leicestershire. They are 5-1 second time around, trailing by 281 with Leicestershire still to bat again. Elsewhere, there are a trio of Rachael Heyhoe Flint Trophy games taking place. I will have a keen eye on the Northern Diamonds game against Sunrisers at Fenner’s. I covered the Diamonds’ win against Lightning at Kibworth on Monday, a low-scoring thriller. I didn’t have much faith in the sunny forecast, didn’t bother with suncream and came away looking like Jerry the Berry from Phoenix Nights. Eek!

well as principles the EU has come up with to guide how they would like to negotiate the issues, Reuters reports.</p> \n  <p>In a surprise shift in May, the US moved to supporting a patent waiver, piling pressure on opponents such as the EU and Switzerland, where many drugmakers are based.</p> \n  <p>Tai told reporters before a meeting of trade ministers in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation

Reuters reports that the APEC ministers met in New Zealand, where they also agreed to consider voluntary actions to reduce the cost of vaccines to fight the pandemic. Italy records 57 coronavirus deaths and 2,436 new cases, the Italian health ministry reports. Saturday’s data is lower than the figures recorded yesterday, with 73 deaths reported on Friday and 2,557 new cases. Not including those in intensive care, patients in hospital stood at 5,193 on Saturday, down from 5,488 a day earlier. There were 20 new admissions to intensive care units, down from 22 on Friday. The total number of intensive care patients fell to 788 from a previous 836. Nearly 238,632 Covid tests were carried out in the past day, compared with a previous 220,939, the health ministry said. The UK records 13 new deaths and 5,765 new cases on Saturday, government data showed. The latest figures had also shown that 40,124,229 had now received their first vaccination shot, and 27,160,635 had received two doses. Hi, I’m Edna Mohamed; I’ll be taking you through the next few hours, if I miss anything you can message me on Twitter or drop me an email at edna.mohamed.casual@theguardian Here’s a brief summary of the major recent developments: A record 600,000 vaccine doses were administered in Italy on Friday. Citing local authorities, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that that put the country in second place in Europe for the number of people fully vaccinated. Going ahead with the UK’s planned reopening on 21 June would be “foolish” and a “major risk”, an expert on an advisory group to the UK government warned. Prof Stephen Reicher said there was enough evidence to say that one of the government’s four key tests for its road map out of lockdown has not been met. India recorded 120,529 new cases in 24 hours as its capital, New Delhi, undertook a partial easing of its lockdown. The city was preparing to deal with an infection peak of 37,000 cases a day, its chief minister said. That’s it from me – I’m handing over to my colleague, Edna Mohamed. The people of Glasgow can finally hug loved ones, meet in homes and drink alcohol indoors for the first time in months, after the city dropped to level 2 of Scotland’s coronavirus measures – alongside an easing of restrictions across the country. While the whole of mainland Scotland was supposed to move to level 1 on Monday, the city will join 13 other council areas in remaining in level 2 for another few weeks. Announcing the move on Tuesday, the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said that while the level 2 restrictions were “still tough”, they were at least “not lockdown”. She added: “We can go into each other’s homes, we can see hospitality open, stay open indoors, so there are significant steps there.” The planned scrapping of remaining restrictions in England on 21 June has been thrown into doubt with reports that the government is looking at contingency plans including a two-week delay to allow more adults to be fully vaccinated. The Telegraph and the Financial Times reported on Saturday that civil servants were drawing up contingency plans to delay the easing lockdown restrictions by two weeks, possibly to 5 July. A senior Whitehall source told the FT: A variety of options are being drawn up, including a delay to step 4 and trading off some measures against others. These are the most pressing issues likely to be covered during Hancock’s grilling: Matt Hancock, the UK’s health secretary, was calling on the government to take Covid more seriously as early as January last year, his allies have claimed, as he prepares to give his full response to explosive accusations over his handling of the pandemic. Hancock is set to undergo hours of questioning before MPs on Thursday after Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson’s former senior adviser, said the health secretary should have been fired on up to 20 separate occasions for various Covid failings. Cummings’ claim that Hancock misled the prime minister over sending untested hospital patients back to care homes – an allegation he denies – is set to be a key focus of the hearing. However, with a highly pressurised grilling in prospect, insiders sympathetic to Hancock said he had regularly been one of the cabinet ministers urging most caution on the lifting of Covid restrictions – and had also been calling for the government’s Cobra emergency committee to meet from very early in 2020. They said Hancock had been pushing for quarantine for travellers from China to the UK before official advice supported the idea – when others in government were suggesting they should be allowed to travel home immediately by train. NHS England data shows a total of 7,254,217 jabs were given to people in London between 8 December and 4 June, including 4,497,648 first doses and 2,756,569 second doses. This compares with 6,287,623 first doses and 4,477,536 second doses given to people in the Midlands, a total of 10,765,159. The breakdown for the other regions is: East of England: 4,003,822 first doses and 2,777,778 second doses, making 6,781,600 in total North-east and Yorkshire: 5,221,289 first and 3,631,836 second doses (8,853,125) North-west: 4,249,530 first and 2,954,182 second doses (7,203,712) South-east: 5,464,828 first and 3,783,734 second doses (9,248,562) South-west: 3,547,393 first and 2,632,020 second doses (6,179,413) A further 471,939 vaccine doses have been administered in England in the last 24 hours, according to NHS England data. That took the total in the country between 8 December 2020 and 4 June 2021 to 56,602,996. NHS England said 150,337 of the new administered shots were first doses and 321,602 were second doses, taking the respective totals to 33,525,485 and 23,077,511. A record 600,000 vaccine doses were administered in Italy on Friday, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports, citing local authorities. That put the country in second place in Europe for the number of people fully vaccinated. “Yesterday was marked by a record number of injections in 24 hours which touched the 600,000 mark, while the number of doses administered crossed the 37 million mark,” the government body in charge of vaccinations said on Saturday. “Italy is in second place in Europe in terms of the number of people fully vaccinated, just behind Germany and ahead of France and Spain,” it added. According to AFP, it said Friday’s record vaccinations were in part due to an increase in the number of vaccination centres, which now stood at 2,666 against 1,500 at the start of March. About 800 new centres will be opened in the coming weeks. According to official government figures, 37m vaccine doses have been administered and 12.7 million people – or nearly 24% of the population aged older than 12 years – have been vaccinated. The pandemic has claimed 126,415 lives in Italy, where the number of cases and deaths has been falling steadily in recent weeks. The government has been slowly easing Covid restrictions, relaxing a night curfew and opening up indoor dining in restaurants and bars. Progress is being made towards a deal on an intellectual property waiver for Covid-19 vaccines at the World Trade Organization (WTO), the US trade representative Katherine Tai said on Saturday. Backers of a patent waiver for Covid vaccines say it would boost vaccine production and improve delivery to poorer countries. These countries are battling surges in Covid-19 infections and struggling to access vaccine supplies as well as diagnostics, therapeutics and medical devices. Tai pointed to a revised proposal from the original proponents of the waiver, led by India and South Africa, as well as principles the EU has come up with to guide how they would like to negotiate the issues, Reuters reports. In a surprise shift in May, the US moved to supporting a patent waiver, piling pressure on opponents such as the EU and Switzerland, where many drugmakers are based. Tai told reporters before a meeting of trade ministers in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum: We’re actually really encouraged to see more WTO members come forth with proposals on what they can support at the WTO with respect to intellectual property rules at the WTO and how they apply to the Covid vaccines. The latest draft from proponents of the waiver sets a time span for a waiver of at least three years and would allow the WTO’s 164 members to determine when it ends. A huge queue has formed outside a health centre in Harrow, in London, which is offering jabs to people aged 18 and over. Belmont health centre in Stanmore, Harrow, is open on Saturday to over-18s who are still waiting for their first vaccine and who live or work in Harrow. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is being administered all day at the walk-in clinic and people do not need to be registered with the practice to get their vaccine. National eligibility criteria in England states that only those aged 30 and over are invited for their first jab, and it is understood that health officials want to prioritise that cohort in Harrow rather than younger age groups, PA news reports. But the poster advertising the walk-in centre clearly states that people aged 18 and over can come along, and the majority of people waiting appeared to be in their 20s. By mid-morning, a huge queue had formed in the area of the health centre, with the line snaking around a car park and stretching down the street. Among them were 20-year-old students Jamie Lesser and Daniel Simmons who arrived at around 8.15am. Lesser said it will be a relief to get the jab, telling the PA news agency: “If all plans go ahead, clubs are going to open in three weeks’ time and we both have plans to go out.” He said he had clubbing plans for “about five days in a row” if nightclubs open, “making up for the last year and a half”. Lesser said he found out about Saturday’s walk-in through friends in a group chat who had forwarded on information about it. He said: To be honest we weren’t intending to give up the whole of the Saturday. We were going to go to the gym fairly early … Thought we’d get here very early to avoid the queue, which hasn’t been very successful. Simmons said that as soon as he saw the chance to get the jab, he thought he would “jump on it”, adding: “I want to get it as soon as possible really.” Queueing for his jab, Chand Shah, a 25-year-old accountant, said the walk-in centre was “heavily advertised” and he thought it was a “good idea” to get the vaccine before the possible further easing of restrictions on 21 June. Asked if he expected to get his vaccine so soon, he said: “No. I was expecting August to be honest.” Shah added: “I think if you get the vaccine you feel safer.” South Korea’s respect for intellectual property rights makes it an ideal partner for the United States as it seeks to decouple its supply chains from China and forge partnerships to manufacture coronavirus vaccines, a trio of US senators said on Saturday during a visit to Seoul. The Democrat senators Tammy Duckworth and Chris Coons, and the Republican senator Dan Sullivan, were in South Korea as part of their first official overseas trip since the pandemic began. After last month’s summit in Washington between Joe Biden and South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in – who was only the second international leader to be welcomed by Biden as president – the senators said their visit was sign of the importance Washington places on South Korea’s role in countering China and shoring up global supply chains amid the pandemic. Duckworth told a group of reporters: We can trust in the legal system here, and we can trust that our intellectual property rights will be protected. South Korea is a logical partner. This is critical whether it is manufacturing [computer] chips or pharmaceuticals. A day after Biden and Moon met, the US drugmakers Moderna and Novavax entered into a deal with South Korea for its Covid-19 vaccines to be manufactured in the country, which has been seeking to secure more and faster deliveries of US-made vaccines. Here’s a brief summary of the major recent developments: Going ahead with the UK’s planned reopening on 21 June would be “foolish” and a “major risk”, an expert on an advisory group to the UK government warned. Prof Stephen Reicher said there was enough evidence to say that one of the government’s four key tests for its road map out of lockdown has not been met. India recorded 120,529 new cases in 24 hours as its capital, New Delhi, undertook a partial easing of its lockdown. The city was preparing to deal with an infection peak of 37,000 cases a day, its chief minister said. Covid-19 policies risk leaving psychological and socioeconomic scars on millions of young people across Europe, with far-reaching consequences for them and society, a wide-ranging Guardian project has revealed. Taking a snapshot, the Guardian asked five members of Europe’s Generation Z how the worst global pandemic in a century has affected their lives, what they have learned and how they see their future after the pandemic. The boss of Airlines UK has complained about a lack of transparency and consistency in the government’s changes to travel rules. Tim Alderslade, the chief executive of the industry body that represents UK carriers, said ministers had not kept to promises over a “green watchlist” that would have given travellers increased warning about a country potentially coming off the safe list. His comments came after the government decided to move Portugal out of the green list and into the amber travel category. It means people arriving in the UK from Portugal after 4am on Tuesday will need to self-isolate at home for 10 days, a change that has left holidaymakers scrambling for expensive return flights in an attempt to beat the quarantine deadline. Speaking about the “green watchlist” proposal, Alderslade told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: It would be a list of countries that were on the cusp, [where] there was a risk that they would be moving from green to amber, so passengers were aware of that, it was fully transparent and they would be taking that risk when they booked. It was entirely to stop what happened last summer when countries were moving up and down off the corridor list on a weekly basis and we saw people stranded overseas and then desperate to come home again because they couldn’t afford to quarantine. It has caused complete pandemonium because we don’t have that watchlist that we were promised by the government and I think with the taskforce, the transparency is not there, we don’t know what has to happen for countries to move from green to amber, or amber to green for that matter. Everyone aged older than 12 years in specific postcode areas of the English county of Berkshire will be offered PCR testing over the next two weeks from Monday in an effort to tackle the spread of the Delta variant. Meradin Peachey, the director of public health for Berkshire West, said a “real concern” with this variant is that if it keeps circulating there may be more mutations. She told BBC Breakfast: What’s happened in the last couple of weeks, especially in the last week, we’ve noticed that a lot of cases now coming through we can’t link to any travellers, which means we now have community transmission. She said cases are mainly among young people, with “virtually nobody over 60 or anyone who has been vaccinated” affected. She added: If the variant spreads and becomes even more, it may mutate again and the big concern is that vaccines won’t work. We really want to get people tested and isolated if they’ve got the virus, stop the spread so that we can make sure the vaccination programme works. Earlier, Dr Mike Tildesley, a member of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (Spi-M) UK government advisory panel, said ministers had a “difficult call” to make. He told Times Radio: It’s a hard one. I’m going to be annoying and sit a little bit on the fence on this, as I don’t think it’s our role as epidemiologists to call that. I think the difficult thing that we have, the difficult situation the government have, is of course if you delay that then of course you’ll get a smaller subsequent wave. I mean, that’s the case with any control policy – if you leave them in for a longer period of time then it’s going to reduce cases. But, of course, if you delay that we know that negatively impacts businesses, people’s livelihoods, and so forth. So, this is the difficult call that they have to make, and all we can do is put together as much evidence as possible and say this is what we expect to happen if you relax on 21 June, this is what we may expect if you delay that by two weeks for example, or four weeks and so on, so they have all the evidence they can to make the decision. It is clear that it would be “foolish” and a “major risk” to go ahead with the 21 June reopening, an expert on an advisory group to the UK government has said. Prof Stephen Reicher said there was enough evidence to say one of the government’s four key tests for its roadmap out of lockdown had not been met, according to the PA news agency. The member of the Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours (Spi-B), which advises the government, said the criteria about the current assessment of the risks not being fundamentally changed by new variants of concern was “not upheld” due to the spread of the Delta variant. Reicher told the news agency: I think, by the government’s own criteria, it’s quite clear that it would be foolish to proceed on the data that we’ve got at the moment. The risk would be very great indeed. And of course it’s a balance of risks but I think it would be a major risk to go further in opening up. Again, I make the point that it is about data not dates, and if you make it too much about the dates then you box yourself into a corner and I think that’s what the government has done. Marton Aszalos, a Hungarian paramedic, and Eniko Tokacs-Mathe, a vet, had to cancel their wedding twice during the pandemic and are finally getting ready for their big day this summer as restrictions are lifted. Reuters reports that the couple, who met in 2016 at a clinic where Eniko was working and Marton was then a trainee, say the emotional rollercoaster of the past 18 months has been draining but has made their relationship stronger. Eniko told the news agency: Because of the pandemic, we had to replan our wedding for the third time; both its date and the venue. The pandemic has also had a serious mental and physical affect on my fiancé as he is an ambulance officer. Reuters reports that the couple held a civil ceremony a month ago and are preparing for a wedding party with more than 100 guests in the town of Makó, near the Romanian border. Eniko is from Transylvania and many of her relatives will cross to Hungary to attend. They have been rehearsing their waltz for the wedding night, after a photo shoot on a motor boat on the Danube. Eniko said: Before, I thought my main worries would be whether we manage the lift in the dance, whether my makeup and hair would look good. But now, I am just happy and hope that all the guests and relatives can make it in health and we can celebrate together. Many couples are relieved that with 53% of Hungarians vaccinated, they can now go ahead and get married, Reuters reports. Gabor Herendi, a wedding planner, usually handles 30 to 35 weddings a year. But, in 2020, about 70% were postponed to this year. After the long wait, “energies will be multiplied”, he said. Hawaii will drop its quarantine and testing requirements for travellers once 70% of the state’s population has been vaccinated, the Associated Press reports, citing the governor, David Ige. The state will also lift its requirement that people wear masks indoors once that level has been reached. The state health department website said 59% of Hawaii’s population had had at least one dose of a vaccine and 52% had finished their dosing regimen. The AP reports: The state is using its figures, and not those provided by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to calculate thresholds for lifting restrictions. The health department director, Dr Libby Char, said that’s because Hawaii’s numbers are more accurate. She said it appeared the CDC had been counting some of Hawaii’s doses twice. Right now, travellers arriving from out of state must spend 10 days in quarantine or, to bypass that quarantine, they must show proof of a negative test taken before departure for the islands. Once 60% of Hawaii’s population is vaccinated, Ige said, the state will allow travellers to bypass a quarantine requirement as long as they can prove they were vaccinated in the US. Restrictions on travel between the islands will open up before that. Ige said that as of 15 June, people will be able to fly inter-island without taking a test or showing proof of vaccination. Also on that date, those who have been vaccinated in Hawaii may bypass quarantine when returning from a trip out of state. Russia has reported 9,145 new cases, including 2,897 in Moscow, taking the official national tally since the pandemic began to 5,117,274. According to Reuters, the government’s taskforce said 399 people had died in the past 24 hours, pushing the national death toll to 123,436. Taiwan has reported 511 new domestic cases, including 35 cases added to totals for recent days. That is up from the 472 domestic infections reported on Friday, Reuters reports. The agency also reports that Taiwan is in talks with US companies about making their vaccines, following similar talks with European firms, citing the health minister Chen Shih-chung. Taiwan, like much of the world, has been trying to speed up its vaccination programme following a spike in domestic cases, but has been stymied by global supply shortages. Chen told reporters that they previously had talks with European companies he did not name about producing their vaccines under licence. “Only recently have we started to have talks with US companies to see if it’s possible or not to carry out relevant subcontracting work,” he added, without providing details. Taiwan has ordered around 5m shots from the US firm Moderna, of which 150,000 have arrived. It has ordered 10m shots from the British-Swedish firm AstraZeneca. Taiwan, also in talks with BioNTech, blames China – which claims the island as its own territory – for blocking a deal with the German company earlier this year. Johnson &amp; Johnson said on Friday it had been in talks with Taiwan about providing its vaccine since last year. The number of confirmed cases in Germany increased by 2,294 to 3,697,927, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) shows, while the reported death toll has risen by 122 to 89,148. Mexico recorded 206 more deaths on Friday, bringing the total death toll to 228,568, its health ministry has said. Separate government data recently published suggests the real death toll may be at least 60% above the confirmed figure, Reuters has reported. Victoria, Australia’s second most populous state, has reported a small increase in locally acquired cases, as authorities hunt for the source of a new cluster of a highly infectious variant. Reuters reports: Five new local cases were reported, taking Victoria’s total to 70 in the latest outbreak, as the state capital, Melbourne, entered its second weekend of a hard lockdown, due to end on 10 June. Curbs were eased for the rest of the state on Friday. Saturday’s count was up from four new locally acquired cases on Friday. Authorities were alarmed after detecting the highly infectious Delta variant for the first time in Melbourne, sparking concerns cases could surge. There are now seven known cases in the city. The Delta variant, which has been classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as among the four variants of concern due to evidence that it spreads more easily, probably caused the latest devastating outbreak in India. Snap lockdowns, regional border restrictions and strict social distancing rules have helped Australia rein in prior outbreaks and keep its numbers relatively low at just 30,150 cases and 910 deaths. Victoria’s outbreak, which began on 24 May, has spurred people to join long queues for vaccinations following a slow rollout since February. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, said 20% of the adult population had now had a first dose of a vaccine. India’s capital city is preparing to deal with an infection peak of 37,000 cases a day in future, its chief minister has said, as the country as a whole reports 120,529 new cases over the last 24 hours. According to the Reuters agency, New Delhi’s political leader Arvind Kejriwal announced a partial easing of a lockdown, while the city is also preparing for oxygen storage capacity of 420 tons, and will set up genome sequencing labs to study coronavirus variants. Citing the federal health ministry, the agency reported 3,380 more deaths across India in 24 hours and said the tally of infections stood at 28.69 million and the death toll at 344,082.","charCount":"26391","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/edna-mohamed\">Edna Mohamed</a> (now) <a href=\"profile/kevin-rawlinson\">Kevin Rawlinson</a> and <a href=\"profile/nicola-slawson\">Nicola Slawson</a> (earlier)"},{"headline":"Trump set to return to public arena as emails reveal how he pushed election lie","standfirst":"<p>Former president to give speech at North Carolina Republican convention as Arizona emails show how audit came to be set up</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jun/05/american-democracy-threat-republicans-donald-trump-voter-suppression\">Will America soon be unable to call itself a democracy?</a></li></ul>","trailText":"Former president to give speech at North Carolina Republican convention as Arizona emails show how audit came to be set up","byline":"Martin Pengelly and Victoria Bekiempis in New York","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7e3215032867d0ca6a90e8aba0a8b5947069acac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e3215032867d0ca6a90e8aba0a8b5947069acac/0_200_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump at Trump International hotel in Las Vegas in October 2020. \" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump at Trump International hotel in Las Vegas in October 2020. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Donald Trump was forced to confront his drastically diminished online presence this week, as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jun/04/facebook-donald-trump-oversight-board-instagram\">two-year suspension from Facebook</a> for inciting the Capitol attack followed the closure of his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jun/02/trump-closes-website-beacon-of-freedom\">blog</a>, an endeavour which failed to attract an audience.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jun/04/facebook-donald-trump-oversight-board-instagram\">Facebook to suspend Trump’s account for two years</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nonetheless, the former president was poised to return to the public arena on Saturday night, with a <a href=\"https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article251898588.html\">speech</a> to the North Carolina Republican convention in Greenville.</p> <p>Trump, who will be 75 on 14 June, was impeached for inciting the Capitol attack as part of his lie that his electoral defeat was the result of mass fraud.

Nonetheless, the former president was poised to return to the public arena on Saturday night, with a speech to the North Carolina Republican convention in Greenville. Trump, who will be 75 on 14 June, was impeached for inciting the Capitol attack as part of his lie that his electoral defeat was the result of mass fraud. He was acquitted thanks to Republican supporters in Congress, who also blocked a bipartisan investigation of 6 January, and remains eligible to run for office again. The former president is reportedly due to hold rallies this summer in other keenly contested states, Florida and Georgia among them. In Arizona, meanwhile, emails were released on Friday in which the Republican president of the state senate said Trump called her after his defeat by Joe Biden in November, to thank her “for pushing to prove any fraud”. The emails add to understanding of the evolution of Trump’s “big lie” about supposed electoral fraud, and how that lie stoked both a controversial election audit in Arizona and the deadly Capitol assault. Beating Twitter to the punch by a day, Facebook suspended Trump on 7 January, the day after the Capitol attack. On Friday, it announced that it would follow the recommendation of its independent oversight board. “Given the gravity of the circumstances that led to Mr Trump’s suspension, we believe his actions constituted a severe violation of our rules which merit the highest penalty available under the new enforcement protocols,” said Nick Clegg, Facebook’s vice-president of global affairs. Suspension from Facebook would be a devastating sucker-punch for most politicians with national ambitions – it is a key platform for fundraising as well as attempts to persuade. But Trump’s response seemed to tease his return. “Next time I’m in the White House there will be no more dinners, at his request, with Mark Zuckerberg and his wife,” Trump said. “It will be all business!” It was also widely reported that Trump believes he will be reinstated to the White House by August, when electoral fraud is proven. Analysts call that a fantasy. The reality of Trump’s ambition to return may be about to be tested. The New York Times reported on Saturday that his political operation has shrunk “to a ragtag team of former advisers … reminiscent of the bare-bones cast of characters that helped lift a political neophyte to his unlikely victory in 2016”. Most such advisers, the Times said, “go days or weeks without interacting with Mr Trump in person”. Trump’s public appeal also seems to have waned. Though he currently travels to Manhattan from his New Jersey golf club to work out of Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue “at least once a week”, the Times said, his commute draws scant attention. In his office, he is “mostly alone, with two assistants and a few body men”. He no longer has the company of longtime cronies, staffers or his children, the Times said. It was not clear what Trump planned to say in North Carolina, although an adviser, Jason Miller, this week trailed attacks on Dr Anthony Fauci, the senior public health official who was regularly at odds with Trump and who Republicans across the US have pilloried for his role in the response to the coronavirus pandemic. Most polling shows that Trump’s hold on the Republican party is strong, making him, as the Times noted, “the frontrunner for the presidential nomination in 2024”. Revelations about his communications with Republicans in Arizona will enthuse supporters and enrage opponents. The emails obtained by American Oversight, a legal watchdog, and released on Friday showed how Trump and his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, pushed officials to act and how a controversial election audit in Arizona’s most populous county came to be set up. Arizona, Pennsylvania and Georgia are prominent among states which produced Biden victories Trump and his supporters insist were won by fraud. They were not. Election day was 3 November. Biden was declared the winner four days later, by more than 7m votes and by 306-232 in the electoral college, the score by which Trump beat Hillary Clinton in 2016, a result Trump called a landslide. Regardless, Trump went on the offensive with a frantic legal effort led by Giuliani and almost entirely laughed out of court. In one email released on Friday, dated 2 December, Karen Fann, the president of the Arizona state senate, told two constituents she had spoken to Giuliani “at least six times over the past two weeks”. Threatened later in the month with being recalled by “the new patriot movement of the United States”, Fann wrote that the state senate was “doing everything legally possible to get the forensic audit done”. Republicans in Maricopa county mounted an audit of ballots. Most analysts view the audit as part of concerted attempts by Republicans in state governments to restrict access to voting or produce laws by which results can be overturned. In the emails released by American Oversight, Fann told the constituent threatening action she had been “in numerous conversations with Rudy Guiliani [sic] over the past weeks trying to get this done”. She added: “I have the full support of him and a personal call from President Trump thanking us for pushing to prove any fraud.” Fann also told a constituent concerned about the use of taxpayers’ money: “Biden won. 45% of all Arizona voters think there is a problem with the election system. The audit is to disprove those theories or find ways to improve the system.” The emails also show the involvement of Christina Bobb, a reporter for One America News Network, a rightwing channel, who has raised funds to support the audit. Another rightwing network, Newsmax, has said it will show Trump’s return to public speaking on Saturday.","charCount":"5995","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/martin-pengelly\">Martin Pengelly</a> and <a href=\"profile/victoria-bekiempis\">Victoria Bekiempis</a> in New York"},{"headline":"Anger on the streets of Porto as Britain shuts down free flow of travel","standfirst":"<p>Tourism chiefs slam the ‘unfair’ downgrading after invasion of football fans </p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus – latest updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul>","trailText":"Tourism chiefs slam the ‘unfair’ downgrading after invasion of football fans ","byline":"Oliver Balch in Porto","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c8c99de21c99e6911a05a473dd70dfebfb19ff4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c8c99de21c99e6911a05a473dd70dfebfb19ff4/0_116_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People enjoy eating al fresco in Porto, but the UK has now placed Portugal on the amber list\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People enjoy eating al fresco in Porto, but the UK has now placed Portugal on the amber list.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Violeta Santos Moura/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Britain’s decision to relegate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/03/portugual-says-uk-dropping-it-from-green-list-is-unfathomable\" title=\"\">Portugal to the amber travel list</a> left Francina Pinheiro totally exasperated. “We’ve done everything by the book here,” said Pinheiro, the owner of a cafe beside Torre dos Clérigos, one of Porto’s landmark sights, as customers arrived for lunch on Friday.</p> <p>“We sanitise everything, we’ve reduced our table numbers.

The move to vaccinate teenagers came despite the country’s health ministry recently releasing finding that suggests a ‘possible link’ between the Pfizer/BioNTech jab and cases of myocarditis - inflammation of the heart muscle - among younger men. Ministers are ‘absolutely open’ to delaying the 21 June reopening date in England if the Delta variant worsens the country’s recovery prospects, the health secretary said. Matt Hancock, in what is thought to be the clearest indication yet that the target date could be missed, stressed that 21 June was a “not before” date and that it was only “pencilled in” as the next step out of lockdown, PA reports. The minister also implied that social distancing could continue beyond the final stage of the roadmap. Pushed on whether the removal of restrictions date could be postponed if the Delta variant data “gets bad”, Hancock told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: “We are absolutely open to doing that if that’s what needs to happen. “We said in the roadmap that June 21 is the date by which we would not take Step 4 before that date and that we would look at the data. “That is exactly what we are doing, so the roadmap was set up in order to be able to take these sort of changes into account.” As of Sunday, 27,957,453 people received their first dose in France, and 13,709,004 people have completed their vaccine cycle. The country also reported 5,070 new Covid-19 cases. France recorded 25 new deaths and 2 new ICU admissions on Sunday. The latest figures are added to a total of 83,572 deaths in hospital since the pandemic began and 2,527 people currently in the hospital for Covid-19. Health experts remain divided over the dangers posed by the new Delta variant of Covid-19 and the risks it poses to the nation as ministers consider whether or not to lift lockdown later this month. Some argue that the new variant, first identified in India, is a significantly increased threat to the UK and have urged that delays be imposed on the total removal of social restrictions, due on 21 June. “By the government’s own criteria, it would be foolish now to proceed on the data that we’ve got. The risk would be very great indeed,’ said Professor Stephen Reicher, a member of the Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours (SPI-B) which advises the government. Reicher said the current assessment of the risks not being fundamentally changed by the appearance of the Delta variant was “not upheld”. This view was backed by scientists of the Independent Sage group, who argued that data indicated the Delta variant had higher infectivity and was more likely to cause disease and hospitalisations. “That makes it very difficult to justify progressing with the last stage of lockdown,” the group said last week. Other scientists believe such calls are premature. While urging caution, they say fears that the Delta variant poses a significant new threat – both in terms of infectivity and as a cause of serious illness – are premature. “The suggestion that the India variant is more pathogenic needs to be taken with a big dose of salt,” said Ian Jones, professor of virology, Reading University. More on the story here: Italy recorded 51 deaths and 2,275 new cases on Sunday, the health ministry has said. The latest figures are down from yesterday’s 57 deaths and 2,436 cases. Patients in hospital with Covid-19, not including those in intensive care, were recorded at 4,963 on Sunday, down from 5,193 a day earlier. There were 20 new admissions to intensive care units, unchanged from Saturday. The total number of intensive care patients fell to 774 from a previous 788. Since the pandemic began in February, Italy has registered 126,523 coronavirus-related deaths, the second-highest toll in Europe after Britain and the eight-highest in the world. Portugal’s prime minister has criticised Britain for removing the country from the green list, allowing travellers to visit Portugal without quarantine on return. On Sunday, Antonio Costa urged London to adhere to a European digital certificate scheme to ease travel. Last week, Britain announced it was removing Portugal from its green list because of rising Covid-19 case numbers and the risk posed by coronavirus variants detected in Portugal. Costa told reporters, “We can’t have this system of instability and changes every three weeks.It isn’t good for those who plan their holidays, nor for those who have to organise the tourism industry to receive tourists in good conditions.” Costa adds that Portugal was maintaining a dialogue with the British government to “explain the decision is not justified and also the serious damage it causes to the British and to the Portuguese economy.” Reuters reports that under the proposed European digital certificate scheme, which the EU plan to introduce from 1 July, EU citizens who can prove they have been vaccinated against Coivd-19, tested negative for the disease or recovered from it will be able to travel freely in the bloc. However, the prime minister did not explain how Britain would adhere to the scheme after leaving the EU. The Covid-19 situation in Portugal has seen a slight increase in positive cases since lifting lockdown restrictions last month. Hospitalisations remain low and daily deaths are near zero following the vaccination of nearly all its most vulnerable elderly citizens. Hi, I’m Edna Mohamed; I’ll be taking over from my colleague Harry Taylor for the rest of the afternoon. If I miss anything, you can message me on Twitter or drop me an email at edna.mohamed.casual@theguardian.com The UK records 5,341 positive coronavirus cases on Sunday and four new deaths, according to government data. This is an increase of 2,101 on last Sunday when 3,111 cases were reported. While daily deaths are down -1% in the last seven days, case numbers are up by 11,022 (49.0%) in the same period. Here’s a round-up of today’s latest coronavirus news from around the world: Eradicating Covid-19 worldwide is not a “reasonable target”, according to a World Health Organization envoy on the virus. Dr David Nabarro said people will have to learn to live with the virus in circulation. Boris Johnson has outlined his ambition to see the planet vaccinated by the end of 2022, ahead of the G7 summit in Cornwall starting on Friday. He will also call for a global watch system to identify new variants. Countries in the Asia-Pacific region are looking to develop their home-grown vaccines as supply shortages threaten efforts to tackle the pandemic. UK health secretary Matt Hancock says it’s “too early” to make a final decision on whether there will be a delay to restrictions being relaxed on 21 June. Former UK prime minister Tony Blair has called for the rules to be relaxed for people who have had both doses of the vaccine, and for Covid-certification for travel. More than 57m doses of Covid-19 vaccines have been given to people in England, latest NHS England data shows. Nearly 23.5 million people have had both doses of the vaccine, with 33.7 million having had at least one jab. UK government ministers are considering giving people a different type of Covid vaccine as an autumn booster, after early results from “mix and match” trials appeared to show promise for an enhanced immune response. Russia has reported 9,145 new Covid-19 cases and a further 399 deaths. A total of 5,117,274 people have tested positive and 123,436 have died. Russia’s own statistics service suggests the actual number to die from the virus may be higher. Germany has registered 2,440 new cases in the last 24 hours, and 24.7 cases per 100,000 people, according to the country’s Robert Koch Institute. A further 74 people have died from the virus, meaning the death toll stands at 89,222. No deaths have been reported from Covid in Wales for the tenth day in a row, according to the latest public health statistics. A total of 92 new cases have been confirmed, bringing the number of infections recorded in the country to 213,091. 5,569 people have died. Campaigners have criticised Boris Johnson for his “audacity” in calling for the world’s population to be vaccinated by the end of next year (see 08:31), accusing him of blocking attempts to scale up production. Global Justice Now said the UK is one of the countries, along with Germany, which is stopping an intellectual property waiver on vaccines and treatments at the World Trade Organization. India and South Africa first proposed a waiver eight months ago, but some countries have obstructed it. The US said last month it would support a waiver. The director of the charity, Nick Dearden, said: “The audacity of Boris Johnson preaching about the need to vaccinate the world is staggering. The UK is one of the last remaining countries blocking an intellectual property waiver on Covid-19 vaccines. “Simply setting a deadline is not leadership. If the prime minister wants to achieve global vaccination by 2022, he should follow in Joe Biden’s footsteps and support an intellectual property waiver on Covid-19 vaccines and treatments.” More than 57 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines have now been given to people in the UK, latest NHS England data shows. The total – 57,193,641 jabs – include both first and second jabs. The latest figures show a total of 590,645 people were vaccinated yesterday. Nearly 23.5 million people have had both doses of the vaccine, with 33.7 million having had at least one jab. Ministers are considering giving people a different type of Covid vaccine as an autumn booster, it has emerged, after early results from “mix and match” trials appeared to show promise for an enhanced immune response. Four different coronavirus jabs have been approved for use in the UK, with more under regulatory review. While people are currently offered two doses of the same jab, researchers have been exploring whether offering a second dose of a different Covid vaccine could generate a stronger immune response. It is also expected that people will be offered a third, “booster” injection, potentially in the autumn, in part to protect them against variants with some resistance to existing vaccines. One possibility being looked at is that this third jab could be of a different type to people’s initial two, a government source said. Trials worldwide are exploring the impact of max and match doses. In the UK, the Com-Cov study, launched in February, is investigating the possibility of using the Oxford/AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax vaccines. The Sunday Telegraph reported promising results from separate trials of more than 600 people in Spain and 300 in Germany. Matt Hancock has formally denied the claim from Dominic Cummings that he incorrectly promised people discharged from hospitals to care homes were being tested for Covid at the start of the pandemic, saying: “No, I did not.” The rejection, after lengthy questioning on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, follows the health secretary’s previous refusal to deny explicitly the claim in the Commons and at a Downing Street press conference, a day after Cummings’ explosive claims to MPs. But in an indication of Hancock’s likely approach when he is quizzed by the same parliamentary committee on Thursday, he argued that Cummings had not in fact accused him of wrongly claiming tests were already being done in March last year – only that they would happen when testing capacity was available. Eradicating Covid-19 from the world is not currently a “reasonable target”, a World Health Organization Covid-19 official has said. Dr David Nabarro, a special envoy to the WHO, said people will have to learn to live with the disease, comments which were echoed by Dame Anne Johnson, a professor of infection disease epidemiology at University College London (UCL). Nabarro told Sky News’ Trevor Phillips on Sunday: “Humanity is going to have to learn how to co-exist with this virus, preventing it from spiking and then surging and causing hotspots of disease, and we’re going to have to be able to do this for the foreseeable future. “Eradication is not currently a reasonable target for the world.” He said: “Each time there is a sudden surge, it does stimulate in one’s mind the thought that there might be a new variant appearing. That wouldn’t be surprising.” He said that will be “the pattern for the future”, adding: “This virus isn’t going away any time soon, there will be variants emerging.” A Dublin pub landlord has said the hospitality industry in Ireland faces difficulties replacing staff who left during the pandemic. Kevin Barden, whose family owns the traditional Irish music pub O’Donoghue’s, told PA Media he has been fortunate to welcome back 19 of his 20-strong team after 15 months of closure. Others have struggled to recruit staff and are finding it hard to fill roles ahead of reopening. “We’ve only lost one for the moment and hopefully we’ll get him back by the end of the summer. So we’ve been lucky enough – we’ve retained the majority of the staff here, which has been great.” Like so many workers across Ireland, the staff have received an income through government Covid-19 wage subsidy support. “They’ve obviously had to take a hit and they all have families and mortgages and bills to pay as well,” said Barden. It’s a month tomorrow since Public Health England published a report on the India variant in the UK when there were 509 identified cases. Since then the case numbers in the country have risen 20-fold and case numbers are continuing to rise. This thread from PHE expert Meaghan Kall on where things in England are now is well worth a read: Countries in the Asia-Pacific region are looking to develop their home-grown vaccines as supply shortages threaten efforts to tackle the pandemic. Japan, South Korea, India, Taiwan, Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam are hoping to develop their own jabs after struggling to get vaccines from overseas, according to the South China Morning Post. While locally developed vaccines aren’t likely to affect the pandemic in its current phase, they believe it’s a better long-term approach. Germany has registered 2,440 new cases in the last 24 hours, and 24.7 cases per 100,000 people, according to the country’s Robert Koch Institute. The latest figures show 74 more people have died from the virus, meaning the death toll now stands at 89,222. There has been a total of 3,700,367 positive tests for Covid since the start of the pandemic. The new Delta variant of coronavirus appears to be about 40% more transmissible than the variant it has largely replaced, Matt Hancock has said, making government decisions about whether to ease restrictions in England on 21 June “more difficult”. Saying that under-30s will be called to begin vaccinations from next week, the health secretary confirmed it was still possible the reopening programme could be delayed or some rules kept in place. “We consider all options,” he told Sky News. Away from the UK, Russia has reported 9,145 new Covid-19 cases and a further 399 deaths. A total of 5,117,274 people have tested positive in the country. The death toll in the country now stands at 123,436. Russia’s own state statistics service, Rosstat, keeps its own records and said on Friday that about 270,000 people had died from the virus and related causes as of April. Excess deaths in the county stand at 425,000 from between April 2020 and April 2021. Marr rounds off by asking whether the health secretary regretted using the phrase about a “protective ring” around care homes. “I said that much later about what we were doing for the winter plans, but it’s been interpreted,” he says, but changes the subject on to the return of children to school tomorrow after half-term. “On testing, tomorrow schoolchildren will be going back to school. You must get tests done this evening because right now secondary school-age children getting their tests done tonight is the most important thing that can be done today.” Marr asks whether Hancock will apologise for any failings on his part during the pandemic, as Cummings did. “At that time everybody was working as hard as possible to protect as many lives as possible on the evidence we had at the time,” he says. “This is true of different administrations and across the whole of Europe. “I know those decisions were taken on the best evidence with the best of intentions.” Marr ends by asking whether Hancock’s been honest and transparent during the pandemic after claims made by Dominic Cummings during his select committee appearance last week. He plays a clip of Cummings saying that in March 2020 Hancock said people would be tested before they went back to care homes and there was a protective shield around them. “It’s complete nonsense,” Cummings said. He asks Hancock whether he told Johnson that people would be tested before they went into care homes. He replies: “We know the testing wasn’t available to test everybody. The advice was that very few people would be able to pass on Covid if they didn’t have any symptoms, so we reserved that for people with symptoms. “The situation with regards to care homes, we brought in a policy of wanting to test everybody going into a care home as soon as we had those tests available. Everyone had a challenge around Europe, in Scotland in Wales, some of the most vulnerable to Covid live in care homes, but at the time, you’ll remember we didn’t have the testing capacity and I built that up, put in place the hundreds of thousands targets and then we could put that into place.” On the idea of children being vaccinated, Hancock says the government is following clinical advice. “There’s good advantages, there’s the reduction in transmission from children to parents and grandparents who might be vulnerable. There’s advantages in protecting education, if one child gets one positive test, the whole bubble has to isolate. “We should follow and listen to clinical advice … I don’t want to put pressure on them with their advice. People should be reassured that whatever steps we take they are on a clinically advised basis.” In response to a question about vaccine passports, or certification along the lines mentioned by Tony Blair, Hancock says: “We know some other countries are going to require it. So if you want to go some other countries, you already have to, the EU are talking about it. It’s my job to make sure you can have that. “If you download the NHS app right now and register it will show you your vaccine status, so you can prove it if you want to go to Greece, for example.” He says rules in the UK are down to a certification review and that there is downsides on a mandatory basis. Hancock repeats Sage’s findings that the India variant is 40% more transmissible. In turn Marr quotes a Sage report saying that a variant of that level of transmissibility would cause severe disruption to the roadmap. Hancock says: “We’re watching the case rates and the rate in which that transfers into hospitalisations. Thankfully that link, which was absolutely rock solid over the autumn, is severed but not broken. There are some people in hospital who have been double vaccinated, but very few. The majority in hospital haven’t been. “Critically, those who are double vaccinated, even if they’re in hospital, they appear to be less ill. The vaccine is working and is our way through it, the new variant, which is more transmissible is making that calculation harder.” Matt Hancock’s now appearing on Marr, after his earlier interview on Sky News’ Trevor Phillips on Sunday. He first responds to an earlier interview by Bob Geldof calling for more vaccines to go to developing countries. The health secretary references Boris Johnson’s call to get the planet vaccinated by the end of 2022, and the rollout of the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab at cost to low and middle income countries. The cut to the aid budget, he says, is supposed to be temporary. “We also have this enormous cost there, so we can continue investing in the NHS, which we are doing, but there’s many things we are doing, leadership on climate change and certainly the work that AZ and Oxford University have done that a quarter of the vaccines across the whole world are delivered with UK taxpayers cash, at cost, no charge on intellectual property, and that’s saving lives everywhere.” Nandy backs vaccination for children after the JCVI’s approval of the Pfizer jab for 12-15 year olds. “I think the regulator has been clear that for 12-year-olds and over the Pfizer vaccine is safe and it’s apparent that the rise in transmission rates is being driven by young people. “It’s right to follow the public health officials particularly the ones that are saying ‘this is what we want to do’. “If public health directors are saying ‘we’ve got a problem in our secondary schools and we need to open up the vaccine, not to make it mandatory, offer the chance to get them vaccinated’, then we need to listen. If we’d taken that approach from the start we’d be in a far better place now.” On international travel Nandy says she believes the current Amber list for international travel from the UK should be scrapped. Current rules mean people travelling to the UK from those countries must quarantine at home or the place they are staying for 10 days and take two Covid tests during that period. She adds: “It’s confusing and that confusion is dangerous at the moment and risks unravelling all the progress that we’ve made. “I think we should have robust quarantine measures for people coming back into the country. “We need to be much clearer that at the moment travelling overseas, particularly when you’ve got countries like Vietnam and Thailand on the amber list where new variants are emerging and being imported into the UK, is the wrong thing to do and the government ought to be clear about that.” Labour’s shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy tells Marr says she’s sceptical on a domestic level on vaccine passports. “I think the global case for vaccine passports is clear because other countries are doing it, but at a domestic level for many of the reasons that you’ve highlighted, discriminatory practices, how they would be enforced, I think there are potentially real problems.” Here’s more detail on the proposal put forward by the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change. People who have been vaccinated against Covid-19 should be able to travel abroad using a new digital pass and go to “vaccine-only” venues such as restaurants or sports stadiums, Tony Blair says today. Releasing a report entitled “Less Risk, More Freedom”, by the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, the former prime minister says the time has come “to distinguish for the purposes of freedom from restriction between the vaccinated and unvaccinated”. The report argues that to date, measures intended to reduce the spread of disease have treated populations as largely homogenous groups. As a result, restrictions – such as national lockdowns, regional-tier systems and entire schools closed following outbreaks – have been blunt instruments. Tony Blair’s on BBC One’s Andrew Marr Show. He says he thinks it’s “uncertain” as to whether the UK will carry on with rules being relaxed on 21 June. Marr says that with introducing vaccine passports or certification status, it will end up discriminating against people who have not had the jab. Blair replies: “Discrimination has got a very loaded meaning in the English Language now. Really when it comes to risk management it’s all about discrimination. The reason we vaccinate the elderly first is that they are more at risk. The reason we ensure people are vaccinated is that we reduce the risk of transmission.” In response to a follow-up question, the former prime minister adds that there needs to be exemptions made for certain groups, including the disabled, as it would be “totally inappropriate” to discriminate against them. Taiwan reported 343 new Covid-19 cases on Sunday, down from 511 reported the day before. The US announced on Sunday that it will give it 750,000 vaccine doses. Phillips asks if we could be giving more vaccines to other countries ahead of the G7 summit next week. Hancock says: “My first duty is to protect the UK population, and that’s to reduce transmission. The way we’re helping the rest of the world is giving away at cost the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine and that means of the 2 billion doses delivered across the world, 500m doses are the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. 70% of those doses are in low and middle-income countries. “The reason we’ve been able to do this is is that we’ve made it available at cost, no charge of intellectual property from the start. I’m delighted there’s a debate, around the G7 table on how to vaccinate the world, but this country has done more than any other by ensuring the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is available at cost.” Responding on whether the government will respond to Blair’s call earlier (see 8.19), for global vaccine passports, as well as relaxations domestically for people who have had the jab. Hancock says: “This debate has been going on for months and we’ve been doing the work inside government, and we’ll be coming out with our answers on that soon. “We know it’s going to be needed internationally, on the domestic front, that’s a matter for Michael Gove.” Phillips asks if the government will want to vaccinate all children. The UK regulator, Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, approved the Pfizer jab for use on children aged between 12 and 15 earlier this week. A story in the Sunday Telegraph said that under plans drawn up by Whitehall, they would be offered the jab from mid-August. Hancock doesn’t rule it out, and says: “We’ve got a few weeks until we come out with a plan on how and if we take this forward. “We know the vaccine both protects you and helps stops it transmitting, and I want to protect education as much as anybody does. Making sure we don’t have those whole bubbles going home and the isolation, that has big upsides for education.” Under-30s in England will be invited to get their jabs this week, Hancock adds, as he says the link between infection and serious illness has been “severed but not broken” by the vaccine. Phillips asks whether there will be a modification of the roadmap, such as lifting lockdown but still asking people to work from home. “There are a series of things at the moment that we’ve said will be part of step four, which include the rule of six and the fact there’s still some businesses that are closed. “We have four reviews into international travel and certification and social distancing, and we are concluding those reviews and doing that at the same time.” Hancock urges people to go and get their second dose to try and stop the damage being caused by the India variant, that is 40% more transmissible. “It’s more difficult to manage this virus with the new variant. But after two doses of vaccine we are confident that you get the same protection as you did with the old variant. “The vaccine works just as effectively, and everyone must get their second jab though, as the first on its own isn’t quite as effective.” The health secretary Matt Hancock is on Sky News’ Trevor Phillips on Sunday, as part of a morning broadcast tour. He asks Hancock whether there will be a delay to the relaxing of restrictions on 21 June. “It’s too early to make a final decision on that,” Hancock begins. “The prime minister and the team will be looking over all the data over this week and we’ve said we will be giving people enough time ahead of 21 June when this is pencilled in, this next step.” He says it will depend on the four tests; cases, hospitalisations, the rollout of the vaccine and the impact of new variants. Hancock admits that there has been a significant impact of the Delta variant. Boris Johnson will urge G7 leaders to “defeat Covid” by vaccinating the world by the end of next year. The prime minister will stress the importance of the programme when he meets leaders on Friday in Cornwall for the first face-to-face G7 meeting since the beginning of the pandemic. The US, France, Germany, Italy and Japan have all said how many doses they will donate to the global vaccine programme, Covax. However the UK and Canada are yet to announce how many they will contribute. Johnson will also call for a global watch system to catch new variants before they spread more widely. Johnson said: “I’m calling on my fellow G7 leaders to join us to end this terrible pandemic and pledge will we never allow the devastation wreaked by coronavirus to happen again.” Head of the UK vaccines taskforce Kate Bingham is to be given a damehood, the Telegraph has reported, after getting the UK access to millions of doses of six different jabs. Her expected honour is among a number in next week’s Queen’s Birthday honours dedicated to “heroes” in the pandemic. Bingham was appointed to the role in May last year and left at the end of 2020. People who have had both doses of a Covid-19 vaccine should have restrictions relaxed for them, according to former prime minister Tony Blair. Blair’s thinktank, the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, sets out how the country should remain open if the virus persists in the population. The report, Less Risk, More Freedom, says that the NHS app – which is currently used for contact tracing – should be replaced with a system of global health passes. “The health pass needs to be usable both by national border authorities and other organisations within countries. It should also include the ability to demonstrate time-restricted testing status for those who aren’t able to be vaccinated. “With this ability to securely prove vaccination status, we can move beyond blunt, catch-all tools and align with other countries by removing certain restrictions for the fully vaccinated – thereby enabling us to sustainably reopen the economy,” the report says.

Today, all things being equal, England will draw their third consecutive Test at home for the first time since the late eighties.

With a maximum of 98 overs to bowl, they could still force victory on a pitch is becoming more uneven. But with a forecast for showers – of the meteorological rather than the middle-order kind – that looks unlikely. Madame de Stael said that one must choose in life between boredom and suffering.

The only winners are New Zealand, Devon Conway and Kane Williamson. At least we can cling on to the gifted but rather embarrassing Ollie Robinson.” “Well written, Tim,” says David Pearl. Thanks! “Root deserves to be panned for this, the worst captaincy decision for half a century. He was too ‘frit’ about losing the match, even though virtually all commentators think that, if the run chase had gone wrong,they could have shut up shop after, say, six wickets. In any case, where’s the dishonour in failing in a sporting run chase? Cricketers of the past would have been ashamed to watch what happened at Lord’s this afternoon.” Yes, it was dismal. But the OBOers’ company, as ever, was very stimulating. Thanks for reading, writing and ranting, and here’s to some proper cricket when the series resumes at Edgbaston on Thursday. Here’s Joe Root. “We set out to lay a foundation. It would have been very easy to go too early today. It was a tricky wicket with a bit of up-and-down bounce, and we didn’t have the time we needed to go after that target.” Asked if he was wary because of the inexperience in the camp, he says, “More so the conditions, I think the talent’s there in the dressing-room... We had to be more disciplined, we made it harder for them to get us out, we were resilient.” On Ollie Robinson, he says, “He’s shown a lot of remorse. He’s got to learn a lot of lessons.” He’s not the only one. Is Robinson available for the next Test? “I’m not sure.” Root isn’t asked how he squares today’s timidity with his stated aim to win every Test this summer. He may face tougher questions at the press conference. The player of the match is Devon Conway. “Ah jeepers,” he says modestly, “yeah, pretty special feeling.” After growing up in South Africa, he’s clearly gone native as a Kiwi. Kane Williamson is being interviewed. He describes the game as “a really good game of cricket”. Was he surprised that England didn’t go for it? “I suppose they were trying to get a feel for it ... and to be fair, they went a long way to doing that.” Diplomatic. He points out, rightly, that a day was lost. And he pays tribute to Devon Conway., “Just looked so comfortable, played within himself, and to score a double century on debut is a brilliant feat.” He also mentions “a special performance from Tim [Southee]”. “ENGLAND SHAMBLES,” says Will Vignoles. “While this has been a somewhat dire end to a game, I do think it’s a bit ridiculous that people are now slamming Root for saying England wanted to win all the Tests this summer. What was he supposed to do, say ‘actually I’m fine only winning 50% of our Tests’ or something? Thanks for the great work as always!” It’s the yawning gap between his words and his action today that’s the problem. And we all know which of them speaks louder. “Our first Test of the summer ends in a draw,” says England Cricket on Twitter. “Great to be back @HomeofCricket in front of fans.” But not a great way to show it. You’ve got to feel for the poor old social-media team, lumped with handling the PR for this. Kane Williamson, who tried to bring the game to life with his declaration, now decides to put it out of its misery. Or ours. As the handshakes are exchanged, some jeers and boos ring out. Joe Root, I’m afraid, has made a mockery of the game and a fool of himself, after boldly announcing that he intended to win all seven Tests this summer. He’s usually a very decent guy, but he has let himself down, and he has treated the first crowd since lockdown really badly. It’s mystifying. 69th over: England 168-3 (Sibley 60, Pope 18) An apology: I’ve failed to tell you about a major milestone. Sibley has now faced 207 balls. Somehow, in all the excitement, I missed his double Dentury. Come back Denly, all is forgiven. “Watched the rugby this afternoon,” says David Hepworth, the music writer, on Twitter. “I appear to have made the right decision.” 68th over: England 166-3 (Sibley 60, Pope 17) A maiden from Santner to Sibley. Maybe Sibley’s on a secret mission: to make sure the Ashes finish 0-0. “Aside from what you owe the game, or the opponents, or the fans etc,” says V Diddy, “when you publicly declare a desire to win all seven Tests this summer you DEFINITELY have a responsibility to try to win this game.” 67th over: England 166-3 (Sibley 60, Pope 17) Pope, facing Jamieson, plays a poor shot for four, off the edge, and a good shot for none – a cut that sounds great but finds the man at backward point. And an email comes in from the scene of the crime. “As a member of the crowd,” says Sam Barnett, “I’d like to say it’s been challenging. NZ understood the meaning of the meaningless Test and set up a meaningful declaration – 3.6 an over! Instead we’ve watched an insipid, unimaginative farce. Surely Morgan’s ODI captaincy has shown that fans will accept a spirited defeat.” 66th over: England 160-3 (Sibley 59, Pope 13) Another change as Santner comes back, bearing nothing in particular. On Twitter, Jim (40th over) is back too. “Tom Adam (over 56) is right that sometimes a captain must prioritise not losing,” he concedes. “And Test cricket is a long and subtle game. But this isn’t a white ball/red ball culture clash. It’s just a bit rubbish.” This in turn draws a response from Dave, writing before Rashford’s goal. “Please try to appreciate that many of us are in our living rooms having to choose between England (cricket) trying not to score and England (football) trying not to score. Not fun. You’re at Lords. That alone is something to be grateful for.” This is true, of Jim. I’m not at Lord’s! If I was, I’d be very tempted to boo. 65th over: England 159-3 (Sibley 59, Pope 12) Southee’s body has got what it wanted – a rest. Jamieson returns, bearing dots, plus a no-ball. The lights come on at Lord’s, which is ironic because the lights will go out on Test cricket if there’s much more of this. 64th over: England 158-3 (Sibley 59, Pope 12) Wagner continues: if this had been a timeless Test, he’d have been fine with that. Pope plays a cover drive for four, which is more elegant than all the strokes Sibley has played, put together. “Afraid you’ve got this wrong Tim,” says Andrew Bennett. “1. Imagine the stick and pressure Root would get from fans and media if we lost this after the poor winter we’ve just had.” Not from me – unless he got the big decisions wrong. “2. The majority of this batting line-up just needs more time in the Test middle before the more important fixtures ahead.” That’s insulting to the New Zealanders, and to the game. “3. The fact there is a crowd has got absolutely nothing to do with how England should be playing. The fans choose to turn up to watch the players, the players aren’t there to entertain the fans.” What??? Of course they are. “How about some support for England instead? Didn’t think the Guardian OBO would turn into a Michael Vaughan echo!” I haven’t read Vaughan for a while, so don’t know quite what you mean by that, but our job is not to support England. It’s to report the game as we see it. But I do wish you and I were in agreement. Thanks for writing, anyway. 63rd over: England 150-3 (Sibley 56, Pope 7) Southee is still on, for reasons I can’t fathom. At one point in this over he pulls up in the crease, as if his body is telling us what his mind is too good-mannered to say. “The only reason to continue watching this dire display,” says Tim FG on Twitter, “is the hope that I’ll get to see the Sky box give Joe Root a seriously hard time afterwards for this dreadfully unsporting, take-the-piss-out-of-the-fans approach to avoiding a loss. Genuinely embarrassing.” At least Marcus Rashford, captaining England for the first time, is emerging with credit. 62nd over: England 149-3 (Sibley 56, Pope 6) Sibley nurdles for two. “Hi again Tim,” says Toby Miller. “This is a poignant scorecard: Boycott and Cowdrey, neither slow nor pusillanimous.” 61st over: England 147-3 (Sibley 54, Pope 6) Just a single off Southee’s over. I’ve been on the OBO at 4 in the morning, but I’ve never felt as sleepy as this. “Evening again Tim,” says David Reynolds, coming off his full run. “In response to Tom Adam [56th over], I have not the slightest interest in white-ball cricket, and I have great appreciation for patient Test-match batting. But, firstly, not a single ‘cross-bat swipe’ is necessary, let alone any ‘flurries’, to at least TRY to score 273 off 75 overs. Test-match batting is not slow batting, it is being able to adapt to the situation and change pace accordingly, in both directions. Secondly, there is nothing remotely traditional about attempting to avoid losing over winning – quite the contrary. Nobody is suggesting slogging – that was not necessary. “England could played very cautiously until tea, as they did, and then just have played busily after that, looking for runs. If they had then lost a few wickets, they could have shut up shop. No problem. Their strategy was not reasonable, it was not sporting, it was not balanced, and it was in no way traditional Test-match cricket. We were given a chance to play for a result by a captain who did not have to do it; we declined. I’ll continue clutching my pearls.” 60th over: England 145-3 (Sibley 53, Pope 6) A few singles off Wagner, whose stock has risen today – he’s been busting a gut, not insulting the crowd. And that’s drinks, when it could be the close – which must mean that NZ fancy some more bowling practice. England need 127 off 15 overs, but mainly they need to show some interest, as they did for a while towards the end of Root’s innings. “If it was 320 off 65, yes, I’d totally agree,” says Toby Sims, “buy Sibley a pint and drop anchor, but it wasn’t. I know England’s batting experience is at the low end, but I’d much rather see them just believing in the talent (it is there!), as 3.7 or whatever it was an over is a fair contest. If you’re set 500 and fighting for a draw, fair play, but NZ gave a damn good declaration – a ‘come on then if you think you’re hard enough’, and I think England should have taken it on. Australia aren’t as kind and it’s good experience...” Yes – the Aussies look like being the only winners here. 59th over: England 143-3 (Sibley 51, Pope 5) A single to each batsman off Southee. The end is nigh. “Watching today’s cricket,” says Jon Collins, “do you think England would be a better side if they’d made Eoin Morgan Test captain in 2017 instead of Joe Root? Too late now, obviously, but his captaincy – and the extra runs from Root – might have made it worth it?” Yes, they might well have done. And Morgan, with his Test average of 30, would not have been out of place in this team. 58th over: England 141-3 (Sibley 50, Pope 4) Wagner to Sibley, and it’s a maiden. For Sibley, you couldn’t call this a return to form, but it is a return to runs, following a sequence of 16, 16, 3, 0, 7, 2, 3 and 0. Those innings were more entertaining. 57th over: England 141-3 (Sibley 50, Pope 4) Southee returns and Sibley finally reaches his fifty, in true Sibley style – with an inside edge into the on-side. He has faced 161 balls, hit three fours, and lost a few thousand fans. Pope then shows him how it’s done with a fluent clip for four. 56th over: England 136-3 (Sibley 49, Pope 0) Root and Sibley had just collided – literally, in mid-pitch, as Root clipped for what should have been three. They ended up with two and Root managed a rueful smile, which was soon wiped away by the indefatigable Wagner. Ollie Pope comes in and starts with a play-and-miss. Another counter-view. “Honestly, the amount of knicker-wetting-pearl-clutching-fit-of-the-vapours outrage on here that England should dare to prioritise ‘not losing’ over ‘trying to snatch an unlikely victory’!” splutters Tom Adam. “‘Moral duty to chase’ forsooth! ‘Won’t someone think of the kiddies who came to watch’ indeed!” (Said no one, ever.) “What a load of absolute tosh. I can only assume that these are white-ball fans who’ve never watched Test cricket, have no idea of the fragility of England’s middle order, think targets are simply there to be knocked off in a flurry of cross-bat swipes and have no appreciation of the subtle joys of the slow grind to safety and the gradual crushing of the opposition’s hopes.” Yes, just pitching in line, and definitely hitting leg. Root departs, cursing loudly. Was he trying to win after all? It’s Wagner, it’s full and it’s plumb. unless he’s hit it. 55th over: England 133-2 (Sibley 49, Root 38) Santner is fit to bowl again, allegedly. Root greets his first ball with a big stride and a crisp sweep for four, and then does it again, well in front of square. And again, for a single this time, as there’s now a man in the deep. England have scored 53 off the past ten overs, which makes it all the more bizarre that they crawled along before that. “For the second time in two years,” says David Reynolds, “we are being schooled in sportsmanship by New Zealand at the home of cricket. Williamson was prepared to risk losing the match in order to win it, as any proper cricket captain at any level ought to be prepared to do. Root apparently lacks this most basic sporting and cricketing spirit. He ought to be ashamed.” 54th over: England 124-2 (Sibley 49, Root 29) Wagner comes back and concedes two no-balls, but no runs off the bat. The chase appears to be off again. We could do with a counter-opinion and here is one. “You’ll win nowt by slogging,” says Mike Shepherd. Are you sure? “In defence of England’s batting here, they’re just not very good batsmen (OK not a resounding riposte). They struggled to score 275 on a pitch with two days’ less wear in it, and no one on either side has been able to consistently score at the asking rate. If they’re trying to build this collection of callow, skittish-intent merchants into a batting line-up capable of winning away Tests, there will be some hard, dull days along the way. I appreciate it’s not great to watch, but I find it a lot less frustrating than (yet) another series of nick-offs and a press conference about taking the positives. “Also, I know it was a flippant point, but I think it’s a bit tasteless to compare Root’s captaincy (which I’m no fan of), to Robinson’s past bigotry.” Ah, I didn’t mean to suggest any resemblance between them, except that both deserve a ban, for different reasons. Also, I suspect we’ll still get the line about taking the positives. 53rd over: England 122-2 (Sibley 49, Root 29) Williamson continues with his so-called off-breaks, and both batsmen take some easy singles. England need 151 off 22 overs. Where’s Eoin Morgan when you need him? In the meantime, here’s Michael Keane. “Following my earlier contribution (12:09pm) about being turned away from Lord’s as I had turned up more 24 hours later than my ticket (which I’d misread) suggested, I am now feeling a calm sense of relief. As a plan B, I considered going to the pub with a cricket-sceptical friend to educate him about the supreme joys of the five-day game, but he was busy. Thank heavens.” 52nd over: England 118-2 (Sibley 47, Root 27) Santner carries on, sore finger and all, and Root helps himself to a cut for two, a sweep for two more, a better sweep for four, and a shovel for a single. He has rattled up 12 off his last six balls, having managed 15 off 54 before that. I don’t know what’s going off out there. 51st over: England 109-2 (Sibley 47, Root 18) Williamson brings himself on, perhaps in an effort to revive the match by giving away some cheap runs. Root edges a sweep for two, and brings up the fifty partnership – it’s now 53 from 123 balls. A worse fifty partnership you will seldom see. “This is unsportsmanlike behaviour,” says Alisdair Gould, “and should be punishable as such! The problem is the individual fear of consequences. Silverwood and Root should have made it clear – this innings no one will be found guilty, it will not count against you, it can count as an individual plus and a team plus though on the positive side. There is no question they morally had a duty to chase. Don’t waste my life, Sibley, any more.” 50th over: England 103-2 (Sibley 44, Root 15) Santner bowls a maiden, even though he seems to have a split finger. And England go back to square one. 49th over: England 103-2 (Sibley 44, Root 15) Sibley takes another single into the leg side off Jamieson, and Root plays a very Rootish glide for four to bring up the hundred. He even plays a pull, but only for a single. There’s still time, lads – if not to win, then at least to give it a go. “Embarrassing,” says Tim Robinson. “Both England’s game plan and Robinson’s teenage kicks, which are bad but should he be banned from playing cricket when someone else who made racist and sexist comments as an overpaid journalist has not been banned from running a country?” It’s a fair point. 48th over: England 97-2 (Sibley 43, Root 10) Sibley, facing Santner, plays another nurdle for another two. Santner then bowls a rank wide outside off which is mysteriously given as two byes. Sibley, unperturbed, nurdles for a single. Five off the over: that’s close to what they need. Are they tempted? Say it is so, Joe. “In answer to you and Dean Kinsella,” says Guy Hornsby, “this is all pretty unedifying. I understand why they’d want to not risk losing but this has been stultifying stuff, with no one really trying to look positive. Mere grim, soporific survival makes a mockery of Root’s claim.” 47th over: England 92-2 (Sibley 40, Root 10) Root takes the hint, glancing a yorker from Jamieson for four. And then he picks up a couple with a glide, to race into double figures. In theory, there are 28 overs left, and England need 181. They’re not suddenly going for it, are they? “I’m seriously worried,” says Peter Metcalfe, “that people might actually prefer watching The Hundred to watching this. Maybe it’s a cunning marketing ploy.” 46th over: England 86-2 (Sibley 40, Root 4) Sibley is thinking about being fully awake. He has a mow at Santner and gets four, along the ground, to long-on – ungainly but effective. And then he tucks for two. He has 20 off the last ten overs; Root has one. One!! “Have England got it right?” asks Toby Sims. “Absolutely not. I’m willing the Black Caps to smash them (as an England supporter) after a very sporting declaration and the chance of a good contest. Yes their attack is good, but I’ve seen zero application to a chase. Stokes and Buttler must be nauseous.” “England’s approach has been an admission of inadequacy,” says Tony Bennett. “They’re telling us they think Sibley, Crawley, Pope, Lawrence and Bracey are not up to it.” 45th over: England 80-2 (Sibley 34, Root 4) Sibley has half woken up, now that it’s too late: he glances de Grandhomme for a two and a single. That’s drinks, with England, I’m afraid, in disgrace. If Ollie Robinson gets a ban for his ancient tweets (and he should, alas), Joe Root should get one for this. It’s a crime against cricket. 44th over: England 77-2 (Sibley 31, Root 4) More excitement: three leg-byes, as Root tries to sweep Santner. In a perfect world, leg-byes would never have been invented – they’re a reward for missing the ball. On Twitter, Andy Zaltzman from TMS makes the same point as everyone else, with added stats. “This is a miserably timorous performance by England,” he says. “67-2 off 40 – their second lowest score after 40 overs in the last 20 years.” In the 1960s, the captain would have been sacked for it. Brian Close was. 43rd over: England 73-2 (Sibley 30, Root 4) Sibley goes crazy and takes a pair of twos off de Grandhomme – one nurdled to leg, the other mirroring it off a thick outside edge. The football is starting over on the other channel, and England’s captain is Marcus Rashford, so a dull day has a sporting highlight after all. 42nd over: England 69-2 (Sibley 26, Root 4) It’s a double change and on comes Mitchell Santner, who was picked for this match but not, as yet, backed by his captain. He’s had fewer overs than the man he’s now bowling to, Joe Root, even though the ball is turning. He gets one to fly off a length and concedes two byes as Root manages to keep his gloves out of the way. “I’m sorry,” says Dean Kinsella, “but England have not even given a nod towards an attempt to chase these runs down. For the first time in my 63 years I’m supporting the team playing against England.” Which makes me wonder: is there anyone reading this who reckons England have got it right? 41st over: England 67-2 (Sibley 26, Root 4) Colin de Grandhomme replaces Southee, which rather suggests that Kane Williamson has lost the will to win. The main excitement in this over is that BJ Watling sends for a helmet and comes up to the stumps, to stop Sibley standing outside his crease. And the consequence is ... a maiden. The partnership is 11 off 63 balls. 40th over: England 67-2 (Sibley 26, Root 4) Sibley goes on the attack! Driving Wagner down the ground for three, as if the past two hours had been a bad dream. Can we have a bit more of that, please? Jim on Twitter is back for more. “210 off 38 remaining overs is a perfectly respectable John Player League target,” he reckons. “Could still go for this, with Sibley set on 22. Oh. Sibley.” 39th over: England 64-2 (Sibley 23, Root 4) Southee to Sibley, and as the ball goes harmlessly past the bat the commentators are reduced to saying “what a good take”. When Sibley nurdles the last ball for a single, he gets some cheers, laced with sarcasm. “It seems peculiarly tactless,” says David Pearl, “to select the anniversary of D-Day to shut up shop, bore the spectators, insult the listeners, and scratch around for four hours when set an eminently achievable target.” 38th over: England 63-2 (Sibley 22, Root 4) Sibley has middled one! He goes back and punches to mid-off’s right to pick up another single. The partnership is now a princely 7 off 7.3 overs. We already knew that Root’s words about winning all seven Tests were less than wise (because you have to take each game as it comes, especially when you’ve just lost three in a row). Now he’s making us wonder if they were also less than honest. 37th over: England 62-2 (Sibley 21, Root 4) A single to each batsman off Southee, both off inswingers, both off the inside edge. Sam Billings runs on with some gloves and a message – the rest of the batsmen threatening to resign, I presume. 36th over: England 60-2 (Sibley 20, Root 3) A maiden from Wagner to Sibley. Gavaskar, infamously, made 36 off 60 overs; England have now managed the opposite, in very much the same spirit. “Killing time without injuring eternity,” says the subject line from David Gaskell. “Five an over is not impossible,” he then insists. “Ben the Flayer would get them single-handed whilst eating a Lords prawn cocktail with his free hand. On the bright side it does get one in the mood for England against Romania.” You can follow that game here if you’re fed up with this one. 35th over: England 60-2 (Sibley 20, Root 3) Southee’s turn to screech for an LBW, as Root takes a near-yorker on the base of the shin. The ump gives a run, when Nasser Hussain rightly points out that there was no nick, but it was going down anyway. “Seems like only a few days ago,” says Peter Salmon, “that England said they would try and win all seven Tests this summer.” Superb. 34th over: England 58-2 (Sibley 19, Root 2) Wagner thinks he’s got Sibley LBW with some swing back in, but the umpire reckons it’s too high, a view borne out by the fact that it thudded into Sibley’s box. I feel his pain, just as I’m hoping that he will feel mine, watching him bore for England. 33rd over: England 58-2 (Sibley 19, Root 2) Root gets off the mark first ball after tea, with a neat dab past third slip. That was more purposeful. The sun comes out, tentatively, like a shy kid who’s heard someone laughing in the next room. It’s going to be Tim Southee, the man most likely to move the game along. “Hey Jim on Twitter,” says Adam Roberts. “I’ll see your Brearley and Boycott and raise you a Gavaskar 1975 (36 years ago tomorrow).” Yes, stupendous stuff – though I make it 46. 32nd over: England 56-2 (Sibley 19, Root 0) Wagner runs back to his mark to try and squeeze in another over, but to no avail. And that’s tea, with the draw the hot favourite. The crowd will have more fun in the queue for a cuppa than they’ve had watching this session. In a perfect world, they would start singing “Are you a general anaesthetic in disguise?” “Give this another couple of hours,” says Geoffrey Smith, “and you’ll all be grateful for Sibley’s 54 not out at stumps.” Speak for yourself! “In addition to the sides’ aims (29th over),” says John Starbuck, “individual players are hoping to make their mark to survive the next week. Anyone from England whose name ends in a Y is at risk and getting desperate.” Ha. 31st over: England 56-2 (Sibley 19, Root 0) Now we have a contest: not just NZ v the draw, but Southee v Root. His opening ganbit is an inswinger, full length, which almost gets through Root’s defences as he shuffles across. That’s a wicket maiden and, for once, the dots don’t feel like a drag. Cometh the hour, cometh the Tim. Southee returns and instantly removes Crawley, playing the same loose drive that Sibley got away with a few minutes ago. Nicholls at gully takes the catch in front of his nose, and the New Zealanders have a sniff. 30th over: England 56-1 (Sibley 19, Crawley 2) Crawley gets a single off a leading edge, thanks to a misfield. Crap cricket all round! Please will someone take this game by the scruff of the neck. “Hell’s teeth,” says Jim on Twitter, “this is worse than watching Brearley and Boycott ‘chase’ the West Indies in the 1979 World Cup final. Smaller target, more overs, worse strike rate. Sitting at Lord’s almost hoping they’ll shake hands at 5.30 and put us all out of our misery.” 29th over: England 55-1 (Sibley 19, Crawley 1) Crawley shows his class for the first time with a flowing off drive, but a diving half-stop restricts him to a single. “I do declare,” says David Mel, promisingly, “that a series of unfortunate negatives – a day’s play lost to precipitation, dismal over rates, Burns being bashed on the head, precipitating two concussion breaks, poor England batting performance – have all conspired to showcase Test match appeal. From the embers (not Ashes) of despair and disappointment rises an enchanting and intriguing Red Ball cricket spectacle. Not harnessing Test Championship points gives Williamson a reason to chase for victory.” At the time of the declaration I’d have agreed with you, but the conspiracy is now between both sides, settling for a stalemate. 28th over: England 54-1 (Sibley 19, Crawley 0) We have a boundary! The first for an hour and a half, and it’s off the edge as Sibley chases a wide one from Wagner. If there’d been a third slip, it would have been a sitter. Wagner is trying to win this match, but I’m not sure that Williamson is. Michael Holding, meanwhile, has taken out his moral compass, applied it to the government’s Covid tests for people flying in, as he did the other day, and established that they are a scam. “Someone’s making a lot of money.” 27th over: England 50-1 (Sibley 15, Crawley 0) Sibley shovels Jamieson off his hip to bring up England’s fifty, which is greeted with ironic cheers – quite reasonably. Somewhere in Durham, Ben Stokes must be tearing his hair out. 26th over: England 49-1 (Sibley 14, Crawley 0) Wagner draws an inside edge from Crawley, which brings some oohs and aahs but no clink of timber. “Tim,” says Andrew Benton, “this is a battle pitting don’t-mess this-one-up-for-once England against batting-collapse-as-usual England. New Zealand are just a side order. Would be good if Bracey could get a reasonable score, he’s been rather in the shadows on his first England adventure.” Would be good if he could get a bat. I’m with you on the analysis of England’s mental state, but don’t we need to get away from taking New Zealand lightly? They’re a top team. 25th over: England 49-1 (Sibley 14, Crawley 0) Santner is taken off and Kyle Jamieson comes back. Williamson evidently wasn’t watching England in the winter when Crawley struggled to get going against slow left-armers – he likes the ball coming onto him. That’s a maiden from Jamieson: you can probably guess who was facing. 24th over: England 49-1 (Sibley 14, Crawley 0) Wagner, not for the first time, makes something happen. And in comes Crawley, on a pair, like about 36 per cent of England’s batsmen. “Gotta say that I agree with John Price (16th over),” says James Evans. “This was not a risky declaration from NZ. England’s lineup is inexperienced and under pressure, and the required run rate was higher than all three prior innings in the match. I think people are being swayed by Williamson-love. Had England been in this position, the narrative would be ‘could’ve declared half an hour earlier if we hadn’t scored so slowly yesterday’. (Not that I think NZ batted too slowly - England bowled very well and they couldn’t risk losing quick wickets.)” Wagner beats Burns outside off, then bowls the same ball, six inches to the left, and reaps his reward as Southee takes a crisp low catch at second slip. That’s good for New Zealand, and probably for England too. Burns goes off with a sore hand and 157 runs in the match. He had ten different partners and only looked in form when batting with the weakest of them, Jimmy Anderson. 23rd over: England 49-0 (Burns 25, Sibley 14) Sibley takes a run! Off Santner, with the tuck to square leg, which is Sibley’s signature stroke. Burns then gets in a tangle or two, and would be gone if Williamson had had a backward short leg. At this rate, if Zak Crawley ever comes in, he may well be greeted with a standing ovation. 22nd over: England 47-0 (Burns 24, Sibley 13) Southee takes a rare break as Neil Wagner comes on. He’s a man of two modes: one nasty, brutish and short, the other full and swinging. He goes full to Burns and finds that swing, but it’s from the hand so not hard to handle. That’s a maiden, so another bit of life drains from this contest. “I’ll see your exciting declaration,” says Adm Roberts, “and I’ll ... well, I’ll ignore it actually.” 21st over: England 47-0 (Burns 24, Sibley 13) Santner continues in his role as the only spinner in the village. And Sibley continues to block for England – he now has 13 from 59 balls. Joe Root may need to send someone out with a fresh pair of gloves and a note saying “Dom, don’t want to spoil your fun, but you do realise this is a run chase?”. Thanks Rob and afternoon everyone. This game was looking delicious when Kane Williamson declared, but Burns and Sibley have done their best to remove the flavour. Come on England, lose a wicket! 20th over: England 46-0 (Burns 23, Sibley 13) Another ball from Southee explodes at Burns, who gloves it fractionally short at Latham at second slip. That’s two vicious deliveries in as many overs, both of which could have dismissed Burns or broken his hand. On the subject of cricket charities, here’s Tom Levesley. “Cricket Without Boundaries does great work using cricket to work on issues like sexual health and promoting the game.” Right, I’m going to hand over to Tim for the rest of the day - you can email him on tim.delisle.casual@theguardian.com or tweet @TimdeLisle. Thanks for your company and emails throughout the game. Bye! 19th over: England 45-0 (Burns 22, Sibley 13) The left-arm spinner Mitchell Santner comes into the attack. He almost picks up a wicket with his first ball, a legside full toss that Burns lobs just short of mid-on. Had that gone to hand, it would have been the second most shambolic Test wicket on this ground: Rogers LBW b Swann in 2013 will never be beaten. “I love Kane’s aggressive declaration,” says Alistair Connor, “but bear in mind, NZ have two practice matches to work out how to win the World Test Championship in English conditions. If they lose one or both, they won’t give a toss (in fact, a toss in the final would be much more important to win).” 18th over: England 40-0 (Burns 21, Sibley 10) Burns is going to continue. That delivery from Southee, though not as extreme, brought to mind that famous delivery from David Saker back in the day. Meanwhile, Sibley survives a big LBW shout when he walks across his stumps to Southee. Williamson decides to review, though I’m pretty sure this is missing leg. Yep, it would only just have hit a fourth stump. 17.4 overs: England 35-0 (Burns 20, Sibley 10) Out of nothing, a delivery from Southee bursts from a fullish length to hit Burns on the glove. The ball lands safely on the off side, but there’s a break in play while Burns receives some treatment. That looked really nasty and he may struggle to grip the bat. 17th over: England 33-0 (Burns 20, Sibley 9) de Grandhomme has a huge shout for LBW against Sibley turned down by Richard Kettleborough. It looked too high, and Kane Williamson decides against a review. Another maiden from de Grandhomme, the seventh of the innings. It looks like the match is meandering to a draw. 16th over: England 33-0 (Burns 20, Sibley 9) Southee changes ends to replace Jamieson. He gets some prodigious inswing to Burns, who walks across and flicks to fine leg for four. In one game, he has jumped from third-choice opener to first choice. “Very little risk involved in the declaration,” says John Price. “Far too little experience in England’s batting line up to make a win a possibility. If Stokes, Woakes and Buttler had been playing, NZ might still be batting.” I know what you mean, though Crawley, Root, Pope and Lawrence in particular can score very quickly. I’d say it was riskier than most declarations. 15th over: England 29-0 (Burns 16, Sibley 9) Sibley plays a loose stroke and is beaten by de Grandhomme. A maiden. England are a fifth of the way to safety: 15 overs down, a maximum (realistically) of 60 to go. “Hiya Rob,” says Rob Little. “Re: the 13th over, does defleated = defeated + deflated? Excellent new verbiage if so.” You know you’re in trouble when typos are your best bits. 14th over: England 29-0 (Burns 16, Sibley 9) After all those maidens at the start of the innings, Jamieson is now going round the park. He concedes FIVE runs from his seventh over, which gives him figures of 7-5-6-0. “Well done to NZ for keeping this game alive and going for the win while risking a loss but I would add that this is the second time in 2021 that a team has adopted this tactic,” says Deepak. “I refer to the Gabba Test where India went for the win when a draw was all that was needed to retain the B-G Trophy. Test cricket is stronger as a result!” That’s true, although the circumstances were slightly different as India were batting last and Australia had more reason to take a risk with their declaration than New Zealand today. But I do agree that there is a new generation of players - hello Rishabh - who see opportunities rather than risks. 13th over: England 24-0 (Burns 15, Sibley 5) Burns softens his hands to steer de Grandhomme to the third-man boundary. New Zealand could use the impetus of a wicket; they’re starting to look a little defleated. 12th over: England 20-0 (Burns 11, Sibley 5) Jamieson spears an errant delivery past first slip for four byes. As with Robinson earlier in the day, I’m surprised that wasn’t called wide. With the batters looking more comfortable, Jamieson tries something different by moving round the wicket to Burns, and hits him high on the back leg with an excellent delivery. Burns tucks the last ball off the pads for a single, which ends Jamieson’s run of maidens. Instead he has the lamentable figures of 6-5-1-0. 11th over: England 15-0 (Burns 10, Sibley 5) Colin de Grandhomme replaces Southee, and Sibley survives a run-out referral from his first ball after being sent back by Burns. It was pretty tight, and he had to dive, but he made it. “It was Kane and NZ’s acceptance of the World Cup final result that saved the day from being poisoned and a now unpleasant memory,” says Jon Salisbury. “Certain other teams would still be in denial.” 10th over: England 14-0 (Burns 9, Sibley 5) After a torrid start, Sibley is starting to look more comfortable at the crease. He plays out another maiden from Jamieson without alarm. Jamieson has figures of 5-5-0-0, coincidentally my go-to formation for the big European away games on Championship Manager 01-02. “Afternoon Rob,” says Simon McMahon. “To return to the theme you started the Test with on Wednesday, New Zealand surely must be the most likeable team in world cricket, maybe even all sports. Their reaction to defeat in the World Cup final at Lord’s two years ago still to this day makes me proud to share the planet with people like them. I’m sure it will be no different whatever happens against India in the final of the World Test Championship. I think that’s enough patronising for one email?” It’s really bloomin’ hard not to unintentionally patronise them, isn’t it. 9th over: England 14-0 (Burns 9, Sibley 5) England’s path to an unlikely victory is probably to bat in a bubble until tea and then assess whether it’s worth risking defeat in an attempt to win. Surprisingly, the bookies have England at 8/1 and New Zealand at 7/1, with the draw 1/5. I think New Zealand have a much better chance than that, though the draw is favourite. “Dear Rob,” says Neil Clarke. “I wonder if you or your readers can suggest a cricket charity to commemorate the passing on Friday, of my good (and quirky) friend Pete N-H? The more unusual and niche, the better! He was an active and enthusiastic club cricketer until his recent illness along with being a committed Warwickshire fan.” I’m really sorry to hear that. I’m sure the readers will have a few ideas but the Lord’s Taverners is always a good option. 8th over: England 13-0 (Burns 9, Sibley 4) In New Zealand’s last Test on this ground, a classic in 2015, they were bowled out in 67.3 overs on the last day. Five of their XI played in that match, so they know it can be done, although they had already lost three wickets by this stage of their innings. Jamieson bowls his fourth consecutive maiden, though it wasn’t as good as the previous three - Burns was able to leave most of the deliveries. “A declaration with the word’s other meaning from NZ, a declaration of their sporting intent,” says Garry Sharp. “ I guess we are so used to Root dragging things out over the last few years (‘when will he declare?!’ ‘Why is he exposing his fast bowlers to injury with the bat when he should declare’, etc) that this approach to the game comes as a lovely surprise.” I’m not a great fan of Root’s captaincy but in his defence, most Test captains are pretty cautious when it comes to declarations. 7th over: England 13-0 (Burns 9, Sibley 4) Sibley drives Southee to mid-off and considers a Red Bull single before rightly deciding better of it. Southee beats him with a gorgeous outswinger, and then Sibley finally gets off the mark - and a pair - by working his 20th delivery to the square-leg boundary. Good shot. “I wonder if Kane Williamson actually realises what a top guy he is,” says Brian Withington. “I’m still amazed at how graciously he accepted the World Cup final ‘defeat’.” I suppose if he realised he was a top guy, he wouldn’t be one. 6th over: England 9-0 (Burns 9, Sibley 0) Jamieson has Burns in his sights for the first time, and beats him with a beauty. It’s another maiden, the third in a row for Jamieson. If it doesn’t rain, England could have a job on to save this match. “Well done to Kane Williamson for giving England the chance to win, or lose!” says Jim Hornby. “In my opinion draws are a stain on the sport of cricket, and something English mentality particularly suffers from. Better to draw than to lose? Too often that means taking away any risk or excitement. To win should mean that either the batting or bowling side excels in their role. To draw should be a consequence of both excelling equally, not as a planned outcome for fear of losing.” You are the great-grandson of Keith Miller and I claim my five pounds. 5th over: England 9-0 (Burns 9, Sibley 0) That ball from Jamieson actually hit Sibley just below the elbow, not on the glove. That really is nobody’s idea of a good time, especially when the bowler is 6ft 8ins. Sibley is fine to continue, though not yet to get off a pair. He has 0 from 15 balls. 4th over: England 8-0 (Burns 8, Sibley 0) Sibley, still on a pair, skims a drive along the floor to gully. Jamieson is probing relentlessly outside off stump and beats Sibley with a lovely delivery that bursts off the seam. The last ball of a majestic over goes the other way and raps Sibley on the glove. 3rd over: England 8-0 (Burns 8, Sibley 0) Southee moves round the wicket to Burns, with two slips and two men in the gully. Burns gets his second boundary with a sweetly timed push-drive through mid-on. “Afternoon Rob,” says Theo. “All four results eh? Someone’s gunning for a tie. I was thinking how close we’ve come to someone carrying the bat in this game, not once but twice. Has it ever happened multiple times in a game? And will it be Dom or Rory who takes us through today?” I’m pretty sure it has happened in first-class cricket, but not in an international game. 2nd over: England 4-0 (Burns 4, Sibley 0) A nervous moment for Dom Sibley, who is on a pair and edges Kyle Jamieson on the bounce to first slip. His hands were soft enough to ensure it didn’t carry. It’s an excellent first over from Jamieson, with every delivery challenging Sibley’s judgement of whether to play or leave. “Love the declaration,” says Neill Brown. “I wonder how much Williamson was influenced by Stokes’ absence? I suppose Ollie Robinson could play the Stokes role and become a national hero in the process?” Not just Stokes but Buttler too. It’s an awkward pitch and I’ll be surprised if England get anywhere near the target. 1st over: England 4-0 (Burns 4, Sibley 0) Immediate swing for Southee, which is just what New Zealand wanted, and Burns has a moment of fortune when a leading edge flies along the ground for four. I don’t know about you, but I feel energised by that declaration. All four results are back on, with a New Zealand win looking much more likely than it did this morning. Blimey, I didn’t expect this. It’s an adventurous decision from Kane Williamson, and means England need 273 in 75 overs. It’s on! So, what do we think for the declaration? Five more overs at run a ball would allow them to set a target of 306 in 68 overs, which should give them immunity against defeat. Play will resume at 1.26pm, it says here. 52.3 overs: New Zealand 169-6 (Watling 15, de Grandhomme 9) de Grandhomme pulls Anderson up and over for four. With New Zealand in one-day mode, I’m surprised England aren’t using their only white-ball bowler, Mark Wood. Not that it matters for now because the rain is getting heavier and the umpires have decided to take an early lunch. New Zealand have a handy lead of 272, and there are a maximum of 75.3 overs remaining (minus two for the change of innings). They could still win this. 52nd over: New Zealand 162-6 (Watling 15, de Grandhomme 2) The new batter Colin de Grandhomme gets off a pair by whapping a full toss for a single. New Zealand lead by 265. “Good morning Rob,” says Adam Roberts. “Your mention of Stuart B on Courtney Walsh’s knee immediately put me in mind of one of my favourite photos. My very young daughter, all golden curls and cherubic features, sitting on Michael Holding’s knee - completely oblivious to who he is - attacking him with a giant foam finger. “Which ties in nicely with today. Unexpectedly awake from 4am. I made the most of it by switching on the cricket at 5. First up is the mellifluous voice of Mikey H, explaining his late arrival at the Test because of the problems of getting out of Cayman to the UK (he had to fly through the States) - something my family is currently struggling with.” Henry Nicholls walks. He missed a reverse sweep at Root and gloved the ball into the off side, where Burns ran forward from slip and swooped to take a fine low catch. 51st over: New Zealand 159-5 (Nicholls 23, Watling 14) Some light rain is falling at Lord’s. Play continues for now, though the umpires could decide to take an early lunch. “Is it just me,” says Mark Steward, “or does Ollie Robinson look like the secret lovechild of Freddie Flintoff and Steve Harmison?” He reminds me more of Harmison when he bats, though he’s obviously more accomplished. I suppose there are many worse lovechildren to resemble. 50th over: New Zealand 157-5 (Nicholls 22, Watling 13) Root hurries through another over, and why not. 49th over: New Zealand 156-5 (Nicholls 22, Watling 12) Watling edges Anderson for four, which takes New Zealand’s lead to 259. There are still a maximum of 79 overs remaining; I’d imagine they will given England a target of around 310 in 67 overs. 48th over: New Zealand 151-5 (Nicholls 22, Watling 7) Root continues. Nicholls swipes him over mid-on for four and then misses a huge slog-sweep. Had he connected with that, no outdoor brunch on St John’s Wood High Street would have been safe. New Zealand lead by 254, and I’m starting to wonder whether England are sleepwalking into a horror movie. 47th over: New Zealand 144-5 (Nicholls 16, Watling 6) Or maybe Root came on so that Anderson can change ends, which is what he has just done. One from the over. “Finding the endless moaning about over rates on telly and radio increasingly irritating,” says Andy Moore. “Why can’t we just accept that in the modern game bowling 15 overs per hour isn’t feasible (what with reviews, drinks breaks etc)? Is there any other sport that places more importance in the time of day than the amount of play to be completed? Looking forward to the Ryder Cup concluding at 6pm sharp with America 1/2 point ahead and Justin Rose 4 up with 5 to play. Really grinds my gears.” I can see both sides of this argument. I find it hard to angry about slow over-rates, but then I haven’t paid however much to get into the ground. Your point is a good one, that there are more natural interruptions nowadays, concussion checks and the like, but equally 12 overs an hour is pushing it. Maybe 14 per hour is a more realistic target, I don’t know. 46th over: New Zealand 142-5 (Nicholls 15, Watling 5) Joe Root replaces Anderson, perhaps with England’s inadequate over-rate in mind. Five from the over. “In cryptic crossword circles, the process which you just have described about de Stael (ie divining the existence of something highbrow from something distinctly lowbrow) is known as ‘Ninja Turtling’,” says Tom Adam. “It stems from, ‘Of course I’ve heard of Donatello. He’s the one with the purple mask.’” That’s a good phrase, I hadn’t heard of that. Also, David Chase would like to discuss your description of the Sopranos as ‘distinctly lowbrow’. It’s okay, he’s in a good mood. 45th over: New Zealand 137-5 (Nicholls 11, Watling 4) I thought they might promote Colin de Grandhomme for some bish-bosh, but BJ Watling is the new batter, and he gets going with an emphatic cut for four. That was a useful cameo from Taylor: 33 from 35 balls with one four, two sixes and a comprehensive range of fresh-air shots. “Kudos to Michael Keane for not venting spleen on anyone else (the pandemic aside) for his mis-ticketing episode,” says Ian Copestake. “I wish him a very tasty lunch.” I hope it’s not egg and bacon. Ross Taylor’s eccentric innings comes to an end. He chases a deliberately wide delivery from Wood and snicks it through to Bracey, who takes a nice low catch to his right. 44th over: New Zealand 132-4 (Taylor 33, Nicholls 10) Jimmy Anderson comes on for Stuart Broad, and Taylor survives a very good-looking LBW shout. The umpire Michael Gough thought there was an inside edge, but the two noises were actually the ball hitting both pads. England have wasted all three of their reviews; had they been able to go upstairs, Taylor would have been out. “Just re-emerging from your Cricinfo link/wormhole in the 34th over,” says Jim Crane. “That 1989 Australia tour itinerary - madon! Six Tests, visits to all the counties, and then casually rounding it off with two bilateral series against Netherlands and Denmark! Imagine rocking up to an ICC board meeting in 2021 with that proposal.” It’s great isn’t it. They played a county game the day after they regained the Ashes, and the stand-in captain Geoff Marsh chose to bat first on a green mamba because, in his words, “the boys are all still pissed”. 43rd over: New Zealand 126-4 (Taylor 30, Nicholls 7) An extraordinary shot from Ross Taylor, who slogs across the line at Wood and top edges the ball high over third man for six. Taylor is so dangerous that, despite middling almost nothing, he has raced to 30 from 31 balls. “Morning Rob,” says Michael Keane. “I’m heading home from Lord’s where, on arrival at the Grace Gate, it transpired that my ticket was for yesterday. Woe is me. As a newly minted member I had thought my days of ticket tragedies were over. But for now even those of us bedecked in egg and bacon need to book a seat. Bloody global pandemic... Looks like it’s the OBO and TMS for me today then. Maybe I’ll make lunch for my better half or something. Feck.” This is mildly heartbreaking, and extremely funny. (I say that as the kind of airhead who does things like this all the time.) 42nd over: New Zealand 118-4 (Taylor 23, Nicholls 6) Nicholls goes into one-day mode, walking down the pitch to slice Broad high over the slips for four. Broad replies with another big inswinger - too big, this time, as it veers away for four leg byes. New Zealand have scored 56 from 12 overs this morning; they lead by 221. “If Friedrich Nietzsche was on comms,” says Ian Copestake, his eyebrows unintentionally betraying the extent of that if, “Zak Crawley’s cover drive would be a cue for his line that, ‘Art is the supreme task and the truly metaphysical activity in this life.’” 41st over: New Zealand 109-4 (Taylor 23, Nicholls 1) Mark Wood replaces Ollie Robinson (14-5-26-3) and beats Taylor with the first and last deliveries of the over. Two runs from it. “The 2000 Code of the Laws of Cricket was the first to use ‘fielder’, instead of ‘fieldsman’,” says Alan Tuffery. That’s interesting; I expected it to be much earlier than that. 40th over: New Zealand 107-4 (Taylor 22, Nicholls 1) That’s Broad’s 518th Test wicket, which puts him one behind Courtney Walsh, the man whose lap Broad used to sit on when he was a kid. Imagine the eight-year-old Broad’s face if you told him they would both end up with 500 Test wickets. After a mildly scandalous amount of misfortune, Stuart Broad finally gets his first wicket of the match in his 38th over. Latham, beaten the ball before, is hit on the back leg by a big inswinger bowled from wider on the crease. Michael Gough gives it out and, though Latham reviews, it’s hitting enough of leg stump for the original decision to stand. 39th over: New Zealand 106-3 (Latham 36, Taylor 22) Taylor misses another disgusting mow across the line at Robinson. But then he finally nails the shot, pinging Robinson over midwicket for a huge six. He is always dangerous, even when his bat seems to have no middle. “Hi Rob,” says Pete Salmon. “Who remembers The Professionals? We’ve been watching Bodie and Doyle at ours as our lockdown treat – just started the final series and already mourning getting to the end. Two very nice moments for OBOers recently. One, Bodie playing club cricket, moving rapidly through the nineties with a series of pull shots, and then getting bowled for 97 after being distracted by a call to duty (followed by getting changed out of his whites in the back of a speeding car, as we’ve all done at some stage). And then in last night’s episode, Doyle having to pretend he’s an intellectual. Bodie: ‘Can you keep the patter up?’ Doyle: ‘Of course, I read the Guardian.’” I’m now desperate to know what Arthur Daley made of our esteemed rag. 38th over: New Zealand 97-3 (Latham 35, Taylor 14) “Excellent Guardianista preamble reference to the French-Swiss Anne Louise Germaine de Staël-Holstein,” says Brian Withington. “She almost invented the Guardian strap line with the phrase ‘Search for the truth is the noblest occupation of man; its publication is a duty’. Apparently she is also quoted as saying, ‘The more I see of man, the more I like dogs’, so something for [redacted] readers, too.” While I’d love to flaunt my education, and perhaps explore what Nietzsche’s philosophy can tell us about Zak Crawley’s cover drive, I only know the Madade de Staël quote because Meadow mentions it in the Sopranos. 37th over: New Zealand 93-3 (Latham 34, Taylor 11) Taylor doesn’t look remotely comfortable against Robinson. He is beaten outside off stump, edges short of the slips and then hacks desperately across the line for a couple of runs. Robinson smiles at Taylor with contempt and then has a big LBW appeal turned down when Taylor misses another smear. England was their last review - it hit him miles outside off stump. That wasn’t great captaincy from Joe Root. But it was a brilliant over from Robinson, which concludes with another play and miss by Taylor 36th over: New Zealand 91-3 (Latham 34, Taylor 8) “The last day of the match will not be so drab if Ross Taylor and Colin de Grandhomme can come in and smash Anderson and co. to make a hundred-odd runs in 90 minutes,” writes Gangesh. “Chasing 300-plus in 70 overs will enthuse England, and their aggression could provide the Kiwi bowlers opportunities. So that’s a possibility Kane Williamson can explore to inject some interest in the game - provided, of course, the notorious English weather stays fine!” A repeat of the last day in 2015 would be all kinds of fun. 35th over: New Zealand 87-3 (Latham 33, Taylor 6) England would love to get Taylor early as he is somebody who can score quickly, as he shows with a cracking extra cover drive for four later. Robinson pulls his length back as a result and rips one past the edge. Lovely response. “Has anyone seen a split screen of Ollie Robinson and Josh Hazlewood bowling?” says Gary Naylor. “The more I see of the Sussex bruiser, the more I think of the Australian err... bruiser.” Hazlewood’s a bit quicker, isn’t he? But otherwise it’s an excellent comparison – forensic accuracy, sharp bounce, seam movement and a hint of malevolence. 34th over: New Zealand 81-3 (Latham 32, Taylor 1) There’s an urgency to New Zealand’s batting that wasn’t evident last night, so perhaps my assumption of a draw was premature. I can think of one precedent in particular. But it’s really not easy to score quickly on this pitch. Broad beats Latham with a stunning delivery and then has him dropped by Crawley at midwicket, a sharp two-handed chance to his right. Broad has had no luck at all in this game. “I can live with batter,” says Adrian Goldman. “What I can’t live with is that in science, sulfate is now the expected spelling, not sulphate. Beyond dismay: pretty much the end of civilisation as we know it.” I’ll see your sulfate and raise you T20 scorecards that have dot balls instead of maidens. It’s cultural vandalism. What the hell is 2-4-12-1 supposed to mean? 33rd over: New Zealand 80-3 (Latham 32, Taylor 0) In the history of Test cricket there have been 3,054 debuts, but none quite look Ollie Robinson’s: 42 runs, seven cheap wickets and a public shaming. He loses his line at the end of the over, spearing a delivery down the leg side for four byes. James Bracey was pretty gutted that it wasn’t called a wide. A third wicket for Ollie Robinson. Wagner, roughed up by a couple of good short balls, top-edged a hook miles in the air and was calmly caught by James Bracey. 32nd over: New Zealand 72-2 (Latham 31, Wagner 10) Stuart Broad gets a chance to bowl at Neil Wagner, who dismissed him yesterday and celebrated with a red-faced flourish. Broad appeals for LBW first ball, but it was going down on the angle. Wagner then cracks two boundaries, a flash up and over the cordon and a majestic flick through midwicket. I’d love to hear Broad’s internal monologue right now. “This fuss comes up regularly,” says John Starbuck. “’Batter’ is, agreed, both an Americanism (by way of the English invention of baseball) and a flour, milk and egg mixture. But think what might happen if we used ‘bowlsman’ as a standard. If we can do it with one essential element of cricket, we can do it with the other. Besides, look at the ambiguities of ‘pitch’ and ‘wicket’, which vary a lot depending on context. Language is meant to be fluid.” Test Match Special overseas link Here you are. 31st over: New Zealand 62-2 (Latham 30, Wagner 2) Ollie Robinson will open the bowling, a reward for his forensic excellence last night. He switches over and round the wicket to Latham, giving him precisely no opportunities to score. Thus, it’s a maiden. “The OED has instances ‘batter’ being used in relation to cricket going back about 200 years, so it’s not like it’s without precedent,” says Andrew Cosgrove. “Also, you don’t talk about a ‘bowlsman’ do you? Anyway, do you think England are capable of batting out two sessions for a draw?” I do, I do. A collapse wouldn’t shock me but I think it’s unlikely, especially as there are likely to be one of two rain interruptions. This is a majestic piece from Andy Bull, with a particularly brilliant intro. “I am becoming more &amp; more dismayed by the use of the term ‘batter’ in cricket,” says Ben Carter. “All the commentators are doing it. The term is BATSMAN. Are you all coordinated by someone who tells you what to say?” Yes, last month Mother Cricket gave her 475 children a collective brollocking for our sexist terminology. Seriously, though, with everything else that’s going on in the world right now, is a change of language designed to increase inclusivity really worthy of dismay? I can understand thinking it’s a bit heavy-handed, not that I’d necessarily agree, but dismay, I can’t have that. The draws are back in town. Today, all things being equal, England will draw their third consecutive Test at home for the first time since the late eighties. And though that’s mainly down to the weather, it also reflects a different approach and a greater resilience under Chris Silverwood. The Bayliss-era England might have thrown the towel in when they slipped to 140 for six; instead, Rory Burns and Ollie Robinson (with bat and ball) stalled New Zealand’s momentum to such an extent that they finished the day crawling along at two an over. New Zealand will resume on 62 for two, a lead of 165. With a maximum of 98 overs to bowl, they could still force victory on a pitch is becoming more uneven. But with a forecast for showers – of the meteorological rather than the middle-order kind – that looks unlikely. Madame de Stael said that one must choose in life between boredom and suffering. England politely request a boring last day.","charCount":"59302","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/timdelisle\">Tim de Lisle</a> (now) and <a href=\"profile/robsmyth\">Rob Smyth</a> (earlier)"},{"headline":"US Women’s Open golf: final round – live!","standfirst":"<ul><li>Hole-by-hole coverage of the action at the Lake Course</li><li><a href=\"https://www.usga.org/content/usga/home-page/championships/2021/u-s--womens-open.html#!scoring\">Leaderboard and latest scores from the Olympic Club</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/jun/05/lexi-thompsons-near-flawless-round-sends-her-into-us-womens-open-lead\">Thompson’s near flawless round sends her into Open lead</a></li><li>Any thoughts?

The powerful Filipino spent most of yesterday’s round driving like Seve, but no matter, thanks to her ability to gouge back into position, as though the penal Olympic Club rough wasn’t there, and her scrambling skills around the greens; she chips a bit like Seve, too. If she wins today, she’ll join Inbee Park as the only teenage winner of the US Open. Park won in 2008 at 19 years, 11 months and 17 days; that’s Saso’s exact age today. Some things seem written. Or could Megha Ganne become only the second amateur to win the US Open, matching the feat of Catherine Lacoste in 1967? The 17-year-old from New Jersey received vociferous support from the gallery yesterday, at one point getting to within a shot of the lead. When asked for her secret, she smiled: “I figure why not make it fun?” She’s the real deal. Some big names are lurking, including 2019 champion Jeongeun Lee6, 2012 PGA winner Shanshan Feng, major champs in waiting Nasa Hataoka and Megan Khang, and seven-time major winner Inbee Park. Should Thompson and Saso hit their stride, it will be a two-woman race, but anything can happen at Olympic Club, and it can happen to the best of them: just ask Arnold Palmer, who lost a seven-stroke lead on the back nine to Billy Casper in the 1966 men’s version. The final round of the 76th US Women’s Open is very much on. Our coverage begins at 6pm BST. -7: Lexi Thompson -6: Yuka Saso -3: Megha Ganne, Jeongeun Lee6 -2: Shanshan Feng -1: Nasa Hataoka, Megan Khang E: Inbee Park","charCount":"10655","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/scottmurray\">Scott Murray</a>"},{"headline":"Marcus Rashford delivers England win over Romania in final Euro warm-up","trailText":"Marcus Rashford’s penalty secured a 1-0 victory for England against Romania, in the home side’s final Euro 2020 warm-up match","byline":"David Hytner at the Riverside Stadium","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3695c1e85b03e683cc3145e5f70df51b84bd4d60\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3695c1e85b03e683cc3145e5f70df51b84bd4d60/58_0_3723_2234/1000.jpg\" alt=\"England’s Marcus Rashford scores what turned out to be the game’s only goal in their victory over Romania at the Riverside.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">England’s Marcus Rashford scores what turned out to be the game’s only goal in their victory over Romania at the Riverside.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Ellis/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Gareth Southgate says that his preparations for Euro 2020 have been more complicated than any other nation and it was easy to see why during this chaotic final warm-up.</p> <p>The manager was without seven of his squad, having given his Manchester City and Chelsea players the week off after their involvement in the Champions League final the previous weekend and that, in itself, felt ridiculous, given England play their opening tie of the finals against Croatia next Sunday.</p> <p>It led to an almighty amount of mixing and matching from Southgate in terms of selection; he gave minutes to five of his stand-by players – Ben Godfrey, Ben White and James Ward-Prowse from the start; Jesse Lingard and Ollie Watkins off the bench.

And he made a good suggestion that other fans should cheer as loud as they can to make clear that they are supporting players taking the knee and rejecting that racism. But there is also a role for the authorities here. If supporters made any other kind of racist gesture in a stadium they would be thrown out, perhaps even arrested, and their team would face sanctions (whether from the league they are part of or the relevant international governing organisation). The same should apply for those who boo taking the knee. And if that means ejecting hundreds of supporters, or even abandoning the game, then so be it. That would make clear that racism is unacceptable and that football is serious about that this time.”</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60bce4618f08b9889b36ab0b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-06T15:10:01.987Z\">4.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>What times like this really call for is a niche reference to today’s game, so here is my interview with the only Englishman to play for Steaua Bucharest ...</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/18/aymen-tahar-football-odyssey-sheffield-united-steaua-bucharest\">Aymen Tahar's football odyssey from Sheffield United to Steaua Bucharest</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60bce3dc8f082e80569f7fec\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-06T15:04:37.393Z\">4.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>One of those starting is James Ward-Prowse, who could be on the move this summer.</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/jun/06/aston-villa-set-to-make-move-for-southamptons-james-ward-prowse-transfer-window\">Aston Villa set to make move for Southampton’s James Ward-Prowse</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60bce2c48f082e80569f7fe0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-06T15:00:08.741Z\">4.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Southgate is playing a number of players who are not in the current Euros squad, which seems slightly off. </strong>Is he just protecting those he is taking?

Here is David Hytner’s match report. My England team for next Sunday: Pickford, Walker, Stones, Coady, Trippier, Shaw, Bellingham, Rice, Foden, Sterling, Kane Southgate: “I think we had chances to make it more comfortable but so did they. I think in the first half we did not work hard enough without the ball. “After half-time we improved and it was helpful when we went to a 4-3-3 a bit later.” On Grealish: “We have a lot of competition in those areas of the field. He did well to win the penalty.” On Henderson’s penalty miss: “I was expecting Dominic to take it and when Hendo walked over I thought he was making sure that happened, so I will have to check what happened.” Southgate offers no clarification on who will replace Alexander-Arnold. My daughter is now on my knee. Her reaction to the game is an underwhelming one. MORE CONFIDENCE. CONFIDENCE IS WHAT WE NEED! Cormac De Barra responds: “In response to Greame Thorn. International football is not the same as club football. The teams that have consistently won big tournaments have a consistent team for 10 or 12 years. They don’t change their teams every 2 years.” Rashford is very proud of captaining England for the first time, saying he dreamt of it as a kid. On booing taking the knee: “It is something we can’t control. We think it’s the right thing to do, so we are going to continue.” The two penalties ... One good. One bad. Mary Waltz offers: “The Three Lions don’t get out of the group stage, Yes a terrible result. England losing to France or Belgium? The two top rated teams. The heavy betting favourites Well duh.” Graeme Thorn says: “I just want to counter Cormac De Barra’s point at 80 minutes - how exactly are players supposed to get experience in international football without actually playing internationals? Besides, many of them have shown they can play against the best in their performances in their domestic leagues and European competitions.” Rashford knows how to take a penalty, which is not new news. It would seem a little strange if Ward-Prowse does not go to the Euros in Alexander-Arnold’s place but Southgate has plenty of justifiable options within the 33. England got the job done but it was not a particularly useful exercise for anyone involved. 90+2 mins: The free-kick is pinged into the wall and England clear. Ivan clashes with Godfrey in the box. The former once again goes down but on this occasion he does seem to have been hit in the face. 90 mins: A cross is pinged to the front post which makes its way to Johnstone who panics and palms the ball into the danger zone. In the end, Romania get a free-kick 25 yards from goal. Will they make the most of it? James Robinson says: “Totally agree with Cormac De Barra. (80mins). England will go out when they come up against the first world-class team ie France, Belgium etc. “Which is pretty much what always happens (when they even get that far). After 49 years I can’t even get excited anymore. It’s been disappointment upon disappointment ever since I did laps of my grandpa’s living room when Bryan Robson scored very early on against France in 82.” 88 mins: England will be happy enough with how it’s gone but not much has been learned. We all knew Ward-Prowse could deliver a set-piece. 86 mins: A cross from the left is attacked by a couple of Romanians but no one can get a touch and Johnstone gratefully claims. 84 mins: Watkins almost has an immediate impact after nice work with Lingard on the edge of the box let’s the Villa forward find space for a cross to the back post which lands on Bellingham’s head but his effort is deflected over. Trippier’s corner is swung to the back post where Mings is waiting but he heads the ball over. 82 mins: Calvert-Lewin powers a header down towards the bottom corner but Nita is equal to it and palms it over. The referee calls for a foul anyway. That’s his final action of the game as the striker is replaced by Watkins. 80 mins: Henderson not guaranteeing himself a go in a Euros shootout. Cormac De Barra says: “My 2 cents on England’s chances for the tournament. Quarter finals or maybe semi’s if they get lucky! Southgate has no idea what his best team is, mostly because he has refused to pick anything like their best team for the last 2 years. He doesn’t know if what he thinks his best team is can play effectively together. They are also lacking experience. Looking at their forwards 90% are under 25 with few caps. Compare that to France! No chance!” 78 mins: Henderson sends the penalty to the goalkeeper’s right but it is a good height and Nita goes across to save with relative ease. Henderson has still never scored for England. 78 mins: Grealish is fouled but then Chiriches kicks the Villa man in the back of the head. The Romanian is claiming it is an accident. I will give him the benefit of the doubt. Chiriches then jumps into Calvert-Lewin in the box and a penalty is given. 76 mins: Lingard and Trippier on for Rashford and Shaw. 74 mins: Ivan dives in the box and then holds his head as if he’s been kicked. What a shithouse. He tries to redeem himself by whacking a shot from six yards out after a rebound lands favourably but Johnstone gets up quickly and drives across to palm the ball wide. 72 mins: Samuel Campbell demands power: “In the unlikely event I ever become in charge of football decision making, those sorts of ‘fouls’ will not be given anymore. Grealish has run away from the ball and made sure his leg makes contact with the defender. It’s cheating but for some reason it gets praised as being clever.” 70 mins: Rashford is on the right now and sends a low cross into the box but Nita dives down to collect. England have taken the lead and now my daughter is crying. I guess she is Hagi all the way. In other Romanian news ... Căpușa means ‘tick’ as in the arachnid, which makes sense based on his first challenge. Mary Waltz says: “It is not restricted to football, this tendency to compare current players to past ideals. It is common in all sports, music, film, the list goes on. Honestly, it’s just lazy journalism. No doubt, in 10 years the “next “ Harry Kane will be anointed when living memories of Gazza fade. And pity the next African American golfer who gets tagged as the next Tiger Woods.” Rashford marks his first game as captain by slotting the ball to the keeper’s left. Nita does not move. 67 mins: Hagi is on for Romania! Căpușa is also on but his dad probably isn’t very interesting. (A quickly Google show Căpușa’s father was a less good footballer) Căpușa’s first act on the pitch is to clip Grealish in the box to give England a penalty. 65 mins: Some pigeons are flying in front of the cameras, which is pretty exciting. Bellingham and Rice are on for Ward-Prowse and Sancho. 63 mins: Rashford collects the ball 10 yards inside his own half and burns the Romanians with his pace, eventually reaching the box but he sends his shot wide due to being off-balance. 61 mins: It’s a low bar, to be fair. 59 mins: Shaw is the latest man to be pulled back. Ivan goes into the book, which shows how many indiscretions there have been. Another Ward-Prowse free-kick incoming. He tries a shot, which Nita reads and claims on his goal-line. 57 mins: Grealish lays it off to Rashford, who tries to dribble through three defenders, he gets past two but the third is one too many. 55 mins: Calvert-Lewin is holding the back of his knee. he is up and about, which is good news. “Will, is it a particularly football-based phenomenon to have to understand something by comparing it to something else, or does it apply universally? Asks Ben Watson. “Because literally every dribbling-based English player has to be heralded as the ‘new Gazza’. “Descartes argued that God must exist because how else could the human mind comprehend Him? I’d argue that it proves He doesn’t, because He’s just a spirit imagined in man’s image. “And if that proves anything it’s that Grealish isn’t the new Gazza or the new anything else, just a decent inside left. Or that I’ve had too much red wine.” Let’s all drink red wine. 53 mins: A cross from the left is not cleared by Rashford, allowing Sorescu to ping a shot from 20 yards but it flies well wide. 51 mins: Henderson looking like me at my first game of five-a-side after a year out: avoid running and pass it to someone else. 49 mins: Not sure how White or Godfrey could really play their way into the England squad against this mediocre Romania team. Not much defensive work to do. 47 mins: Grealish intercepts a loose pass from Nita, resulting in Sorescu pulling the Englishman back for a foul. Ward-Prowse has another chance to swing in a cross from the left. It is a great delivery for the boys in blue to attack but Calvert-Lewin can’t get a decent connection, sending it straight into Nita’s arms. Here we go again! Henderson is on! Phillips off. Andrew Patrick says we are all wasting our time watching this: “Flipped to Austria-Slovakia at half time and Austria have a midfielder named Grillitsch who looks a bit like Grealish. Plays for Hoffenheim apparently. That passes for mild amusement on a rather dull day of friendlies.” Robert Lin says: “You say it will seem a little weird when JWP doesn’t go to the Euros but surely he’s the frontrunner to replace Trent.” I would take Lingard as I think he can change games. Southgate is looking for a replacement for a defender. Ward-Prowse has certainly made the biggest impression, though, so could change minds. England’s most dangerous weapon today is Ward-Prowse’s set-pieces, so it will seem a little odd when it doesn’t go to the Euros. For a view on the pitch invader. Niall O’Keefe emails to say: “It is absurd to say taking the knee and BLM is a ‘political’ movement. As with the very ‘social’ issue (not political) that is climate change, there is no one party pushing the agenda down anyone’s throats. Facts are facts. “As for the football, would English players do better if they had a more unifying anthem like Flower of Scotland. I wonder how many players on that team are pro-monarchy? “But the 3 Lions and the Unicorn symbolism make sense. Seen all four gallivanting around the Lake District many years ago. They are proud to be English.” Not much to say: England have hit the crossbar twice, Romania are not very good. The fans are booing again. Cracking support! 45 mins: One minute added on. 44 mins: Sorescu reminds everyone that Romania are also playing in this game, as the defender bursts forward before playing a one-two, which allows him to fire a shot on goal which Johnstone repels with his right foot. Stanciu then picks up the ball and whacks a shot just over. 42 mins: Romania will be pleased to get in at half-time at 0-0. 40 mins: England have a free-kick on the left flank, as Romania aren’t very good so are just fouling people to delay the inevitable. Ward-Prowse curls it in but the referee gives a free-kick for a foul on Chiriches. There is a pitch invader. How tedious. 38 mins: Rashford decides to liven things up by having England’s first shot on target but it dribbles into the goalkeeper’s arms from 20 yards. Grealish bursts into to life to take the ball into the box before laying it off to Sancho who curls one towards the top corner, only to see it ping off the crossbar. 36 mins: Mings gives away a foul on the halfway line. Stanciu spots Johnstone about six yards off his line, so decides to shoot from 45 yards out. It does not go well for the Romanian. Controversial view: England will be a lot better with Chelsea and Manchester City players in the team. 34 mins: Romania are calmly passing the ball around and England are not doing much in the way of pressing. A time to conserve energy. 32 mins: Grealish is getting annoyed with the referee after he is fouled for the third time. Cicaldau is the culprit and he looks to be doing it quite deliberately as he is getting nowhere near the ball. Ward-Prowse swings in the free-kick from wide on the right, finding Calvert-Lewin on the edge of the box but his fine header pings off the crossbar. Finally some life in the game. 30 mins: Paun collects a cross 22 yards out and swivels to fire a shot at goal but it is straight at Johnstone. Judging by the opening half an hour, I think my daughter is going to be more of a cricket fan. 28 mins: Sam Matterface has just said the best chance of the match has fallen to “Austria”. Better luck next time, Sam. 26 mins: All gone a touch quiet. 24 mins: England are dominating possession and starting to stretch the Romania defence. A ball is pinged out to Sancho on the right wing who lays it off to Godfrey, the defender puts the ball on his left foot and sends a disappointing shot wide. Rashford bursts into the box, Chiriches comes across and the England captain goes down but it would have been a soft penalty. The referee rightly is not interested. 22 mins: A fine pass is slipped through the Romania defence for Rashford to latch onto but Nita comes out quickly to claim. Peter Oh says: “I have very modest expectations of a Hendo appearance. If he manages to kick the ball reasonably accurately a couple of times and not re-ack his gah-twang, I’ll be more than satisfied.” 20 mins: I am not sure Gareth Southgate has learned much about this 11 in the opening 20 minutes. All a bit flat and tedious so far. 18 mins: Calvert-Lewin gets behind the defence from where he attempts to find someone in the box but there is no one in the area in blue as the goalkeeper calmly claims it. 16 mins: Ward-Prowse’s next corner is head well clear. The ball belatedly falls to Grealish who pings his shot about 20 yards over the bar from distance. Ivan thrashes a dangerous cross into the box which is flicked on by an England head and eventually cleared by Godfrey before anyone in a white shirt can pick it up. My inbox is full of people discussing the booing of taking the knee. I will look to post a few at half-time. 14 mins: Ward-Prowse swings in a corner but Godfrey is penalised for a foul. Looked very soft. 12 mins: Sancho runs from an offside position to collect a ball over the top, before cutting inside and whacking a shot high and wide. The assistant must be having a nap as Sancho was a good yard off. Mary Waltz says: “Southgate will put Henderson in for 45 minutes, see how he performs, then make a decision. This game is a friendly, it counts for nothing, it is the perfect place to experiment.” He has already been named in the squad, though. 10 mins: Grealish gets on the ball for the first time, allowing him to play a one-two with Rashford to get the Villa man into the box but his cross is blocked by Chiriches. Down the other end Romania do get a cross into the box which finds Marin 12 yards out in space but he sidefoots his shot straight at Johnstone. 8 mins: Plenty of condemnation of the ‘fans’ booing taking the knee. Romania’s Stanciu and Nedelcearu didn’t bother to join in. I am not sure why. 6 mins: England get the ball in Romania’s defensive third but the visitors look pretty well organised early on. Mike MacKenzie says: “Okay I admit at outset that I’m a Liverpool fan. But Roy Keane must have lost the plot completely to criticize Henderson getting 45 minutes. Hendo is the best England has at his position and also offers leadership. So what’s the harm in giving him some time in a mostly meaningless match to see if he is fit?” 4 mins: The Romania corner is worked back into the box after a clearance but the dangerous cross bounces off a forward and out for a goal-kick. A little nervy from England so far. Vibhanshu Bisht says: “As much as Keane always needs something to be angry about, the key to resolving any dilemma in international football is asking - What would Germany do? And I do not see Germany ever taking two players in two key positions into a tournament when they are not ready to play 90 minutes from day one.” 2 mins: There were some boos before kick-off for taking the knee. Let’s focus on the football ... The first bit of action sees Mings make a mistake, letting the ball go past him and out for a corner to Romania. Peep! Peep! Peep! Here we go! “I would love to see Grealish really turn it on in this game and make himself undroppable from the first eleven,” says Dean Kinsella. “He’s the nearest thing we’ve got to a Gazza at the moment.” The Romanian national anthem is being sung in Middlesbrough and my house. What a way to start. England are playing in all blue in an attempt to sell shirts to the masses or something. Romania have gone for an all white number to confuse fans. The Romania support staff are having photos with Harry Maguire on the bench. Good bunch of lads. To offer the contrary view on booing the knee, here is Tory MP Lee Anderson: Southgate on the team selection: “We have players that need minutes and players that definitely don’t need any more minutes. We have players and combinations we need to look at. On replacing TAA: “We are still openminded and we will see after today’s game.” On Rashford being captain: “He is by far the most experienced international player in the team. He had a big smile on his face when I told him.” He also confirms Henderson will get 45 minutes. Mary Waltz emails: “Why did the players decide that taking a knee was necessary? Because the vile racist abuse on the pitch, in the stands, and on social media was a constant feature in football. “Oh, I am here to be entertained, I don’t want to be lectured, keep politics out of Sport.” The abuse was not being addressed. This has been going on for decades. You don’t like mixing politics and sports? Then turn in your mates when they start pouring out their hatred and bile. “Of course no one agrees with the racists but don’t remind me that it is happening and just sit there and take it” They will stop taking the knee when the abuse stops.” Skipper stat. Should England throw caution to the wind? No, says Jacob Steinberg. Gabriel Clarke has a load of photos of Tyrone Mings and Conor Coady for the two defenders to discuss. This is CLASSIC CLARKE. Luke Nicholas offers a fair riposte to my analysis: “Only Godfrey, White and Ward-Prowse in the starting line up aren’t in the Euro squad and it’s safe to assume that one of them will replace Alexander-Arnold so not really that weird to play them.” I would still argue at a week away from a tournament to have a back four including two people - Godfrey and White - I think will not be at the Euros is a bit odd. I think Lingard will go to the Euros in Alexander-Arnold’s place. Get your optics around this ... Henderson is on the bench and is set to get about 45 minutes of action. Roy Keane thinks it is all a bit silly to have some of these injured players in and around the squad. Keane does always need something to be angry about, that’s for sure. Some Jonathan Wilson to get you in the mood for the Euros ... David Wall emails: “Earlier in the week Paul MacInnes wrote an excellent article where he called the booing of players who take the knee before kick-off a racist gesture. And he made a good suggestion that other fans should cheer as loud as they can to make clear that they are supporting players taking the knee and rejecting that racism. But there is also a role for the authorities here. If supporters made any other kind of racist gesture in a stadium they would be thrown out, perhaps even arrested, and their team would face sanctions (whether from the league they are part of or the relevant international governing organisation). The same should apply for those who boo taking the knee. And if that means ejecting hundreds of supporters, or even abandoning the game, then so be it. That would make clear that racism is unacceptable and that football is serious about that this time.” What times like this really call for is a niche reference to today’s game, so here is my interview with the only Englishman to play for Steaua Bucharest ... One of those starting is James Ward-Prowse, who could be on the move this summer. Southgate is playing a number of players who are not in the current Euros squad, which seems slightly off. Is he just protecting those he is taking? It is nice for those earning their debuts but it seems a little futile seven days before their opening game against Croatia. England: Johnstone, Godfrey, Mings, White, Shaw, Phillips, Ward-Prowse, Sancho, Calvert-Lewin, Rashford, Grealish Subs: Pickford, D Henderson, Ramsdale, Trippier, Coady, J Henderson, J Lingard, Watkins, Bellingham, Kane, Rice Romania: Nita, Sorescu, Chiriches, Nedelcearu, Camora, Cicaldau, Marin, Stanciu, Ivan, Alibec, Paun Subs: Vlad, Iacob, Căpușa, Ganea, Rus, Maxim, Morutan, Hagi, Buedescu, Olaru, Baluta Today is the big day when we find out if football really will be coming home this summer. If England manage to beat the nation ranked 43rd in the world at the Riverside, it will be a true indication of where the Three Lions are currently. OK, that is all a lie. Basically, today is about whether some England fans continue to boo the players taking the knee and to see if Jordan Henderson is in any fit state to lead England into the tournament after four months out injured. The Liverpool skipper is set to play his first minutes since February, which is good news but it is still a bit of a concern for Gareth Southgate that his main midfielder is very short of time on the pitch. Southgate has spoken very eloquently about the boos before the Austria game from people who blighted the good work being done by the players, staff and may in wider society. Hopefully those who want to support their national team will realise what that means today. The subplot to this game is very personal. My six-month old daughter is half English and half Romanian - today will determine who she will support at football for the rest of her life. Will it be a lifetime of Carlton Palmers or Gheorghe Hagis for her? Let’s hope - at the very least - it will be a good watch for her.

Few Classics in Britain and Ireland these days unfold without at least one, and frequently two, Ballydoyle runners controlling the pace, and it made for a refreshing change to see some different colours leading the turn for home. At the same time, though, the sight of just 11 runners – the smallest field for nine years – heading around Tattenham Corner was a reminder that most Derbys over the past 20 years would have looked the same without Coolmore’s involvement. Time may show that Bolshoi Ballet was very unfortunate on Saturday, but even if he thrashes Adayar in the Irish Derby – and there is no certainty as yet that either colt will run at the Curragh – his only chance to win the original (and best) version has been and gone. His defeat proved to be the only significant setback for O’Brien over the weekend, however, as the trainer’s failure to win a ninth Derby on Saturday was followed by a first success in the French equivalent at Chantilly on Sunday. St Mark’s Basilica, last year’s Dewhurst winner, recorded a comfortable one-and-three-quarter length success, leaving O’Brien two-for-three in the weekend’s Classics after Snowfall’s dominant victory in the Oaks on Friday. The reasoning behind “the lads” decision to send only Bolshoi Ballet to Epsom is anyone’s guess. Perhaps they simply reckoned him to be borderline unbeatable. But it is also possible that with Galileo, Bolshoi Ballet’s sire, now 23 years old, winning the Derby with a 40-1 chance like Wings Of Eagles, who stands these days as a National Hunt sire, is no longer a priority. What they – and their rivals at Godolphin – are ultimately looking for is the “right” kind of Derby winner, with speed as his strong suit and just enough stamina to last home. For one more year at least, the search goes on.","charCount":"3902","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/gregwood\">Greg Wood</a>"},{"headline":"Yorkshire v Sussex, Somerset v Hampshire and more: county cricket – live!","standfirst":"<ul><li>Live coverage from the action around the grounds</li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2021/jun/05/yorkshire-v-sussex-glamorgan-v-lancs-and-more-county-cricket-live?page=with:block-60bbd6598f082ac930aeb6d5#block-60bbd6598f082ac930aeb6d5\">Saturday roundup: Labuschagne hits his groove in Glamorgan win</a></li><li><a href=\"mailto:tanya.aldred.freelance@theguardian.com\">Email Tanya</a> with any thoughts | Tweet <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tjaldred\">@tjaldred</a></li></ul>","trailText":"<strong>Rolling report:</strong> Join Tanya Aldred for live County Championship coverage from around the grounds","byline":"Tanya Aldred","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9b05907dd8b65050323aac0e6872a2896449ba77\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b05907dd8b65050323aac0e6872a2896449ba77/762_1452_3319_1992/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yorkshire had first-innings lead of 245 midway through the evening before Sussex closed Saturday’s action on a sturdy 38 without loss. \" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yorkshire had first-innings lead of 245 midway through the evening before Sussex closed Saturday’s action on a sturdy 38 without loss. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: George Wood/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<div id=\"block-60bd0af18f08b9889b36ad17\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-06T18:02:34.454Z\">7.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>A lip-smacking game, and an apt end</strong> to what has been a fabulous first eight Championship rounds.

Plus two post-tea last-day thrillers in a week - I’m happy with that! It leaves the tables nicely poised with plenty to ponder going into July. I’ll see you at Old Trafford on July 4, and maybe a few of you at an OBO or two. Thanks for all the messages and comments, it’s been a blast. So with Yorkshire sitting in a circle on the grass, enjoying a post-match loll and a beer, I’ll wish you a lovely evening, good night! Lancashire 126 (played 8) Yorkshire 122 (played 8) Northants 110 (played 8) Glamorgan 99 (played 8) Kent 75 (played 8) Sussex 71 (played 8) The captain does it! Ben Brown finally goes for 22, edging Patterson behind, with 32 balls of the match left! What a game, what a session! Six overs left and a last sanitisation break. Atkins has been hit on the helmet and the physio runs on - are they checking him for concussion? With ten overs left, Dom Bess “drops” Ben Brown at leg slip. It would have been a helluvacatch. The physio is now doing something very squeamish to Bess down by the rope - looks as if he’s attempting to “pop” it back into place. To a weird and wonderful field, two leg slips, 2 slips, 2 short legs, Crocombe flaps at another short one from Willey and is snaffled by Duke behind the stumps. Sussex 187-9! Meaker puts his bat under his right arm and thumps off after fending the ball to Harry Brook at short leg. Sussex have now lost four for seven in three overs. Ben Brown crosses his legs at the non-striker’s end and stares hard at the grass. Sussex 187-8 Those damn Yorkies! Carson is caught by a leaping, juggling Thompson at leg slip! David Willey leaps and punches the air. Sussex lose their seventh wicket with 19 over left. I must have half an eye on the round-up, but will keep updating from Headingley, where the sun is out, Ben Brown has been joined by Jack Carson and there are 19 wickets left. Sussex 186-6. Somerset 119 (played 8) Gloucestershire 109 (played 8) Hampshire 108(played 8) Surrey 101 (played 8) Leicestershire 93 (played 8) Middlesex 60 (played 8) Somerset 360 and 409-7 draw with Hampshire 311 and 88-2. Somerset 15 points, Hampshire 14. Kent 330-5dec draw with Northants 392 and 184-8. Kent take 14 points, Northants 13. Just the one game left at Headingley, which is bubbling up just like the Roses match did last week. And another! No success for Ibrahim this time round, caught at slip for a duck! Two wickets in three balls for Dom Bess. Sussex suddenly 180-6. No declaration now! Thomason wibbles and is caught at slip for 52. Just 21 overs left as young Dan Ibrahim strolls out, squatting by the rope before he crosses the line. An email lands from DaddyPig: “The pie was lovely thank you Tanya. It was a small one shared with my son. That was an odd way for Thomason to reach fifty, after nearly four hours of focused defiance, a wild swing and bottom edge to fine leg. “Meanwhile we have people in the party stand on the Western Terrace. There is some ‘singing’, and they even tried to start a Mexican Wave at one point.” Fifty to Thomason, off 175 balls, in 234 minutes, applauded enthusiastically from the dressing-room. A super effort by him, and the whole Sussex team. As you’ve probably guessed by now, analysing technique is not my best suit. But I thought this was interesting in The Cricketer - though Pope always looks a million dollars when on song. To the cry of York-shire, York-shire from the Western Terrace, Thompson treads in and Brown defends. And again: very correct, dropping the ball down near his feet. He currently has six off 29 balls. Hope the pork pie was good, Tim. Northants are still eight down, so leading towards a draw there too. Warwicks 120 (played 8) Essex 118 (played 9) Nottinghamshire 115 (played 8) Durham 111 (played 8) Worcestershire 97 (played 9) Derbyshire 60 (played 8) Rain at Taunton, as Thomason carefully pushes forward to Coad. We’re back, though draws hang heavy in the air. An end of term feel to the press box, time to discuss the sprightliness of Bob Appleyard well into his nineties and whether it is possible to remove the chocolate off a Leibniz biscuit in one bite. Chelmsford: Essex 210 DRAW WITH Nottinghamshire 293 and 44-2 Taunton: Somerset 360 and 409-7 v Hampshire 311 and 88-2 Canterbury: Kent 330-5dec v Northants 392 and 155-8 Headingley: Yorkshire 558 v Sussex 313 and 164-4 The new ball doth blow, and Travis Head drives to Tom Kohler-Cadmore at first slip who clings to a quick ‘un. Is there life in the old dog yet? Sussex 164-4. “Dear Tanya,” writes DaddyPig “Someone behind us just offered the opinion that “it’s not great to watch, is it ?”. After a year of not being here to watch it, and two sides giving their all, on a pitch that’s batter-friendly as long as you concentrate like fury... I think it is good to watch. Especially as I’ve a pork pie for the tea interval.” I think it is one of those games you have to utterly relax into. If you start thinking about that pin-board you should be putting up at home, you will find yourself dancing with very itchy feet. Particularly if you haven’t a pork pie (or equivalent). The new ball swishes along to the boundary after one-legged hop- drive by Thomason off Coad. A last throw of the dice here at Headingley - and Ben Coad takes the new ball, with 39 overs left. Notts 293 and 44-2 draw with Essex 210. Essex 11 points, Notts 12. Bad light and rain meant it is officially curtains at Chelmsford. The top four in Group one are separated by only nine points, with Essex in trouble because they have played an extra game. It is raining at Chelmsford, with Notts 44-2. Hampshire plough on, 80-2, Alsop and Northeast holding off Lewis Gregory et al. Northants are seven down now, Taylor caught of Gilchrist for 12, Rossington still there on 31. The lead is 201, which Kent will consider tasty. My favourite part of this absolute cock-up is Steven’s little jig of delight at the end: Wicket-tastic! just after we were discussing how Orr had played barely a false-shot, he is bowled by Dom Bess. A smashing innings, beautifully poised, resolute in defence but prepared to whack the short ball. Even more importantly, he used up 216 balls. Travis Head strides out, which for most of this season has had an unhappy outcome. He is greeted with a ball from Bess that spittles past the bat. Well, well. Sussex 125-3 with 49 overs left. While at Canterbury, Daniel Bell-Drummond runs out Procter. Northants 128-6. Rossington and Procter are speeding things up a little at Canterbury, but at 124-5, Northants only have a lead of 186. Unlike Lancashire’s long-legged slips cordon, Harry Duke and Adam Lyth (second slip) cut diminutive figures, lorded over by Tom Kohler-Cadmore at first slip. The two current bowlers, Thompson, hair held back with a headband, and David Willey, are both proud owners of a Darren-Gough approved bowler’s backside. Sussex 117-2. Defence ahoy. Another wicket at Chelmsford, as Ben Duckett’s stumps are rearranged by Shane Snater for 16. Notts 41-2, Harmer has bowled ten empty overs. This CANNOT be 27 years ago. From the Headingley trenches, a message arrives, “Hello Tanya from my son and me in the North East Lower. Much as I admire Kane Williamson’s flighty declaration at Lords, it isn’t as if there’s anything important at stake, like a top two place in a County Championship group. Meanwhile, I think there’s life in the game here, with a second new ball due before tea.” Tim, if this happens, or doesn’t happen, the jinx lies with you. Forgive me. Ian Holland’s stumps are arranged by Lewis Gregory for 9. Hampshire 39-2. It was Lewis Gregory who got the pre-prandial wicket at Taunton: Steel lbw for 14. Holland and Alsop the batsmen in possession. I can’t help think Somerset delayed their declaration a little too long - without Coverton and Leach their bowling doesn’t have such a here-we-go-on-a-roll feel to it. Hampshire 38-1 Over in the RHF trophy, Thunder are chasing 260 against Lightning for consecutive wins. Someone has ripped up the Northants script. Zaib wafts and is caught behind for six. Northants 73-5. Sainsbury’s sandwich section was dominated by cricket fans, who picked over the selection with surprising disdain. The sun pops her head through the clouds and out come the players. Very sporting and surprisingly bold. England need 273 in 75 overs Time for a dawdle down the Headingley streets to buy some lunch. Back in 40 minutes to see if Somerset and Yorkshire can whistle up a win, Essex can find the magic formula at Chelmsford and Kent and Northants can contrive something out of nothing. Chelmsford: Essex 210 v Nottinghamshire 293 and 23-1 Taunton: Somerset 360 and 409-7 v Hampshire 311 and 30-1 Canterbury: Kent 330-5dec v Northants 393 and 70-4 Headingley: Yorkshire 558 v Sussex 313 and 105-2 And at 12.58, Steve Patterson persuades the umpires to change the ball and they swap it for another, 53 overs new. Does anyone know how it works - the umpires can’t possibly have a ball for every eventuality. They can’t have 79 balls in their store-cupboard? Northants, Northants! Currently 60-4, with two for Stevens, one for Gilchrist and one for Cummins. A lead of just 123 over Kent, but Saif Zaib, who has had a smashing little season, at the crease. I didn’t realise prawn cocktail was back in vogue! My mum’s go-to starter for a 1980s dinner party. The rain forces an early lunch at Lord’s. The clouds remain high above Headingley and Sussex reach their hundred, with just two wickets lost this morning. Sussex will be quietly pleased with their morning’s work, with ten minutes till lunch. A breakthrough at Chelmsford! It be Peter Siddle, with Compton gone for 8. And an email whisks through the air from Romeo: “Hampshire need 459 to win. I wonder what the highest chase total set has been in CC history?” A quick google seems to suggest that the record remains with Middlesex, who chased 472 to beat Yorkshire by seven wickets in May 2014, with Chris Rogers unbeaten on 241. At last! Bartlett gets his hundred, Somerset pass 400 and Hampshire have a challenge. Hampshire need 459 to win. Here, 20 year old Ali Orr nestles to his fifty! With a pull down to fine leg , another Sussex half century on debut Paul Edwards tells me that since August 1 last year, Sussex have given first-class debuts to nine players in 13 games. To compare, in the BWT, Lancashire gave first-class debuts to six players. Siddle and Sam Cook with the new ball at Chelmsford; Compton and Slater just have to bat it out for some plump points for a draw. Michael Duggan asks the question: “Really don’t understand why Somerset haven’t declared – over 400 ahead on the final day. Any thoughts? Might be waiting for Bartlett to get 100 but seems very strange to jeopardise your chance of winning the match.” We were just mulling that over in the Headingley press box. Equally puzzled. They must really rate the Hampshire batting line-up, I guess. Some great livestream stats for the RHF trophy. Add the 589,000 youtube and facebook views for the Roses match last week, and a lot of people are watching a lot of cricket. Now then. So Essex are all out for 210, trailing Notts by 293. If this was last year, you’d put money on Harmer to bowl Notts out for under 100. But in 2021, the Notts-up has become something of an endangered species, and Harmer has lost his cloak of invincibility. And another! With the third ball of his morning spell, Van Zyl feathers Thompson through to Duke and has to trudge, eyes firmly on the grass back to the dressing-room. A golden duck. Sussex 60-2. A top edge! A bit of extra bounce from Bess and Tom Haines sends the ball up and into the paws of Adam Lyth. The end of a partnership of 60 between the openers, Sussex 60-1. A wicket at Chelmsford! Shane Snater is lbw to Brett Hutton for his 200th first-class wicket. Essex 195-9. Sussex pottering along much untroubled here at Headingley, which will please Lancashire no end. Ben Stokes will make his boom-back at Chester-le-Street on Friday in the T20 game against Yorkshire. Did Darren Stevens read the memo? Darren Stevens doing Darren Stevens things, pincering Emilio Gay lbw for 8, Northants 14-1. Adam Lyth gets just the one over before Dom Bess is thrown the ball. A real opportunity for the scruffy scamp today, though on a pitch that didn’t much spin yesterday. Jack Carlson, who has just been given a contract extension by Sussex, did manage to extract some turn and bounce with the wickets of Malan and Ballance. What is this sorcery? Kent have declared on their overnight 330-5: which gives Northamptonshire a second innings lead of 62 runs. Some old-fashioned declaration bowling hangs in the air. Adam Lyth bowls the first ball of the day, from the Emerald Stand end. A Sunday sprinkling of spectators, Orr and Haines the men charged with steadfast blocking. Dawid Malan , who I’m reliably informed played a perfectly-judged innings yesterday, driving particularly well before being out for 199, spoke engagingly last night: “ I’ve tried to learn from my failures at Test cricket and put that into practice in four-day cricket. “Since 2019, I think my record speaks for itself in just having that fearless approach in four-day cricket and backing my technique and way of playing. Possible Test return? “I wouldn’t be here playing four-day cricket if I didn’t want to play Test cricket again. I still feel like I’ve got a hell of a lot to give. Whether I’m good enough, that’s not my decision. I just have to keep scoring runs. “Since I got dropped in the middle of 2018, I’ve gone away and done what I was told, which is score runs. Hopefully, if I keep getting big scores like this, I can put pressure on the people who make decisions. “I think I played well in that Ashes series (2017/18). That was as well as I could have played at the time. “I feel I now know my game better. Being back in the T20s and the odd ODI, I’ve learnt what I need to do to perform at that level. That’s really important. “You’re playing against bowlers you play against all the time, but Test cricket is a different mentality and there’s more scrutiny. In my last five Tests, I probably didn’t handle that as well as I could have. Hopefully I’d be in a better position now.” Chelmsford: Essex 180-7 v Nottinghamshire 293 Taunton: Somerset 360 and 323-6 v Hampshire 311 Canterbury: Kent 330-5 v Northants 393 Headingley: Yorkshire 558 v Sussex 313 and 38-0 Marnus Labuschagne’s highest score of a difficult summer, an unbeaten 63, ended county cricket’s only remaining unbeaten record as Glamorgan chased 188 to beat Lancashire by six wickets at Sophia Gardens shortly before 12.30pm on day three. The much-vaunted Australian had not previously posted a fifty in seven Championship innings in 2021. However, his eighth delivered the goods – a high tempo 72-ball knock navigating reverse swing from seamers including Saqib Mahmood. Labuschagne has been a shadow of the player who dominated county attacks in early 2019, yet here navigated a pitch Lancashire’s Alex Davies described as “substandard” at the close on Friday. He also posted 44 in the first innings. The Queenslander said: “It was nice to be out there for the winning runs. To do it the fourth innings when the ball has gone reverse, which is exciting to play against because it is something we don’t get much of in Australia in domestic cricket, was very satisfying.” Glamorgan’s second win came as they advanced from 137 for three overnight, chasing the fixture’s highest score. However, they still have an uphill task to claim a top two finish in Group Three ahead of Lancashire, Yorkshire and the other contenders, Northamptonshire. Lancashire, the leaders, had hoped to take a significant step towards the top group, but they may be only four points clear of Yorkshire at the end of this round with two still to play and Scarborough to visit next month. Dawid Malan showed his rounded class with a serene 199 for Yorkshire as they seek victory over Sussex at Headingley. They claimed a first-innings lead of 245 midway through the evening before Sussex closed on a sturdy 38 without loss. In his first four-day appearance since last August, when he scored 219 in a Bob Willis Trophy draw against Derbyshire here, the left‑hander punished an inexperienced attack to move from 103 overnight before being bowled by off-spinner Jack Carson after lunch for the second 199 of his career. Malan, who played the last of his 15 Tests in August 2018, missed out on becoming the first Yorkshire player to score double hundreds in two consecutive innings. Warwickshire went top of Group One with a 191-run win at Derbyshire, who were bowled out for 121 in their second innings. Oliver Hannon-Dalby took four for 24 to secure a fourth win. Gloucestershire’s strong position at the Group Two summit has been eroded with back-to-back defeats, this latest against Leicestershire at Grace Road. The home side won by an innings and 93 as the left-arm spinner Callum Parkinson returned career-best match figures of 10 for 108. Somerset will hope to leapfrog Gloucester with a home win over Hampshire. Half-centuries in the second innings for Steve Davies, Tom Abell and George Bartlett secured a lead of 372 and counting. Essex and Nottinghamshire, two contenders at the top of Group One, look likely to play out a draw at Chelmsford, while Durham are far from out of the equation having won at Worcestershire chasing 86. Kent, for whom Ollie Robinson scored 120, are playing out a rainy high-scoring game with Northamptonshire at Canterbury in Group Three. That is on course for a draw assuming there is no final day contrivance. Hello! It’s a sweet June morning at Headingley, though the gateman warned that there is rain in Wakefield and it is a-heading this way. A busy day on Saturday with wins for Derby, Worcestershire, Leicestershire and Glamorgan, which leaves just four matches in play today, but enjoy every moment: this is the last day of CC till July 4. A quick summary of the position in group 3: if Yorkshire win, they’ll be four points behind Lancashire, if they draw they’ll be 12 points behind Lancashire. Northants are coming up on the inside, and nor are Glamorgan (quite) out of it. If Yorkshire fail to win today, Northants will be between 3 and 5 points behind.","charCount":"18344","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/tanyaaldred\">Tanya Aldred</a>"},{"headline":"If Britain wants to set an example to the G7, it must restore its aid pledge","standfirst":"<p>MPs have a chance to ensure Boris Johnson arrives at the summit as first among equals at this time of multiple crises<br></p><ul><li>Andrew Mitchell was international development secretary from 2010 to 2012</li></ul>","trailText":"MPs have a chance to ensure Boris Johnson arrives at the summit as first among equals, says former development secretary Andrew Mitchell","byline":"Andrew Mitchell","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1c5b4890de222e0f8ad11df0e2e788f49947aaa7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c5b4890de222e0f8ad11df0e2e788f49947aaa7/0_169_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A G7 sign on the coastal path near the Carbis Bay resort in Cornwall.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A G7 sign on the coastal path near the Carbis Bay resort in Cornwall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Ahead of this week’s G7 summit in Cornwall, illustrators of much loved children’s books have joined families across the UK in tracing their hands – raising them in unison to call for action from world leaders on the Covid pandemic, injustice, the climate crisis and nature loss. The <a href=\"https://crackthecrises.org/#join\">Wave of Hope</a> is supported by 75 civil society organisations in the Crack the Crises coalition.</p> <p>On the high streets of my own constituency, in the Royal Town of Sutton Coldfield, charity shops are also getting involved. This feels very different to Make Poverty History or the If campaign, which formed the backdrop to the last occasion on which Britain hosted the G8. This time, international development campaigners have joined the green movement and civil society to put their collective force behind the campaign.</p> <p>Together, these organisations – including the Women’s Institute, the RSPB, Save the Children, Send A Cow, War Child and the Wildlife Trusts – represent tens of millions of ordinary people. This attempt to connect what Britain has been going through over the past year to what the rest of the world faces is a significant departure from campaigns of the past. The message – that we may all be in the same storm but we are not in the same boat – is likely to resonate because our experience of the pandemic has very much depended on our starting point.</p> <p>For those of us lucky enough to have gardens and a spare room, the first lockdown was an opportunity for a spring clean and a bit of fresh air. But if you work, or run a small business, in hospitality or the travel industry the impact has been profound. For commuters, the opportunity to work from home saved the cost of the season ticket and offered an opportunity to spend more time with the kids, but for other families, isolation gave way to desperation and mental health deteriorated. Home school was a novelty at first, but became a test of endurance for many parents, and severely set back many less fortunate children.</p> <p>Across the world, the impact has also been universal but profoundly uneven. The World Bank estimates that between <a href=\"https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/updated-estimates-impact-covid-19-global-poverty-looking-back-2020-and-outlook-2021\">119 million and 124 million people</a> have been pushed back into poverty: the needs of the poorest countries in the world have grown. Fragile health systems have been tested to their limits, as has our own NHS.

The Wave of Hope is supported by 75 civil society organisations in the Crack the Crises coalition. On the high streets of my own constituency, in the Royal Town of Sutton Coldfield, charity shops are also getting involved. This feels very different to Make Poverty History or the If campaign, which formed the backdrop to the last occasion on which Britain hosted the G8. This time, international development campaigners have joined the green movement and civil society to put their collective force behind the campaign. Together, these organisations – including the Women’s Institute, the RSPB, Save the Children, Send A Cow, War Child and the Wildlife Trusts – represent tens of millions of ordinary people. This attempt to connect what Britain has been going through over the past year to what the rest of the world faces is a significant departure from campaigns of the past. The message – that we may all be in the same storm but we are not in the same boat – is likely to resonate because our experience of the pandemic has very much depended on our starting point. For those of us lucky enough to have gardens and a spare room, the first lockdown was an opportunity for a spring clean and a bit of fresh air. But if you work, or run a small business, in hospitality or the travel industry the impact has been profound. For commuters, the opportunity to work from home saved the cost of the season ticket and offered an opportunity to spend more time with the kids, but for other families, isolation gave way to desperation and mental health deteriorated. Home school was a novelty at first, but became a test of endurance for many parents, and severely set back many less fortunate children. Across the world, the impact has also been universal but profoundly uneven. The World Bank estimates that between 119 million and 124 million people have been pushed back into poverty: the needs of the poorest countries in the world have grown. Fragile health systems have been tested to their limits, as has our own NHS. While developed countries bore the brunt of the first global waves in 2020, developing countries – notability India and Brazil – have suffered worse outbreaks in subsequent waves during this year. So too with the climate crisis. While we experienced record temperatures last yearand suffered repeated floods this year, island states and countries such as Bangladesh continue to be threatened by rising sea levels, while east Africa and the Sahel struggled with droughts and even locust plagues. And fragile states, such as Yemen, Syria, South Sudan and Ethiopia, continue to face a tragic combination of conflict, instability and poverty while they also try to deal with Covid. These are systemic problems that require big solutions. They can’t be tackled by one country working alone. Rather, they require countries coming together and for multilateral institutions to function once more. Britain played a key role in establishing the rules-based system and our global architecture. And it is Britain that hosts the first G7 summit of the post-Trump era. We also host a pivotal global summit in Cop26, as time to reverse climate change and prevent species extinction is rapidly running out. The eyes of the world are truly upon us. But in this moment Britain is found wanting, because we have removed a foundational piece of our own global leadership. Britain is the only G7 nation cutting aid this year.

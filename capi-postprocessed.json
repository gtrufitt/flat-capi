It’s one that was touch-and-go to even go ahead and one that will proceed in the absence of spectators. Thankfully it is indeed happening. Not often do we see a 1-v-2 in round 11 of the season but that’s what we have on our hands tonight.</p> <p>Its lustre might have been brighter had Melbourne beaten Adelaide last week and come into this contest unbeaten, but let’s be grateful for what we’ve got. This is still a Friday night worth staying in for, and let’s face it if you’re in Victoria you’ve got no choice anyway. So fill the fridge full of VB/Kombucha/Yakult and strap yourselves in for a match that will reveal more and more about the supposed leading lights for this year’s premiership.</p> <p>This is a real chance for both teams. It’s a chance for the Bulldogs to prove without a shadow of doubt that they are the real deal, the finest outfit in the AFL. Beat the Demons and that cannot be in dispute. Should Melbourne bounce back, however, we’ll likely be back in the murky waters of ambiguity. All of which, it must be said, is tempered by the fact it is only round 11 and Covid-19 could still resurface to bite all and sundry on the derriere.</p> <p>But that can wait. All that matters is a top-of-the-table clash and a Friday night to savour. I’m here to keep you posted. You’re here, among other duties, to keep me company. If you’d like to get involved, you know the drill. Let’s do this thing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AFL/status/1398182728772636680\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Wish you were here ❤️<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/AFLDogsDees?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#AFLDogsDees</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/pZq2mJCcwu\">pic.twitter.com/pZq2mJCcwu</a></p>&mdash; AFL (@AFL) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AFL/status/1398182728772636680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 28, 2021</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-05-28T09:05:13.178Z\">at 10.05am BST</time></p>  </div>","wordcount":"2416","commentCloseDate":"2021-05-31T09:00:00Z","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2021-05-28T09:05:17Z","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2021-05-28T12:07:22Z","liveBloggingNow":"true","productionOffice":"AUS","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/p/ht49x","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c321caecaddcaa86d333d664632e7c49f5c8422/0_79_2362_1418/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","isLive":"true","bodyText":"Q4: 14 mins remaining: Western Bulldogs 6-9 (45) vs Melbourne 13-8 (86) Butler has a shot for his first goal in the AFL but somehow misses everything from not far out at not much of an angle.

Q4: 19 mins remaining: Western Bulldogs 6-9 (45) vs Melbourne 12-8 (80) The Dees chop off another chain of Dogs’ passes and the ball settles in dispute in the middle of the ground. Great pressure to start the quarter from Melbourne. It’s been great all night. The Bont then has a chance from range but Lever is on hand to spoil the ball through for a behind. Big quarter from the Demons, not obviously on the scoreboard, but they gave the Dogs no space, no time, no favours and are full value for their six-goal lead. Their pressure is intense, their class next level. It would take a miraculous resurgence from the Bulldogs to get back into this. Glad I’m not the only one... Q3: 2 mins remaining: Western Bulldogs 6-8 (44) vs Melbourne 12-8 (80) Goal! Weideman again! The Dees clear the ball from the middle - again - and Weideman takes a strong mark in front of goal before converting for a second goal in as many minutes. Danger signs for the Dogs, if they weren’t there already. Q3: 4 mins remaining: Western Bulldogs 6-8 (44) vs Melbourne 11-7 (73) Goal! The Dees regain possession in their back half and try to keep the ball. It works as they chip the ball around before finding Weideman inside 50, a shade to the right. It’s not the easiest of set shots but he slots it nicely to extend the Dees’ lead. Q3: 6 mins remaining: Western Bulldogs 6-8 (44) vs Melbourne 10-7 (67) Salem coughs up the ball in a dangerous area and the Dogs pounce, setting up Naughton but he too misses his set shot. Straightforward chance; should have done better. Needed to have done better if the Dogs are to get back in this one. Q3: 9 mins remaining: Western Bulldogs 6-7 (43) vs Melbourne 10-7 (67) Great pass under duress from Lever paves the way for a big grab by Harmes on the 50 and then Fritsch has a chance to swell the lead but his set shot hits the left post. Not much of an angle, not far out. Poor miss. Q3: 11 mins remaining: Western Bulldogs 6-6 (42) vs Melbourne 10-6 (66) Goal! Fritsch is awarded a free for high contact on the right pocket and does very well with his set shot, drilling the ball home with a deft snap. Advantage Demons. Q3: 12 mins remaining: Western Bulldogs 6-6 (42) vs Melbourne 9-6 (60) Now it’s the Dees who try to chip it around. The ball becomes unstuck but the Dogs can’t do anything with the turnover and the Demons rebound with ease. Slow, watchful start to the third term but that probably suits the Demons just fine. Q3: 15 mins remaining: Western Bulldogs 6-6 (42) vs Melbourne 9-6 (60) Petracca goes a torp from defence and though it’s a good kick the Dogs mop up and creep the ball forward. Gawn is on hand, however, to punch the ball over the boundary line. Nothing direct nor precise from the Dogs. Q3: 17 mins remaining: Western Bulldogs 6-5 (41) vs Melbourne 9-6 (60) Oliver is good in congestion but the Dogs win a free deep in defence to clear the ball from danger. But their ball movement is stagnant and the Dees bottle it up. Q3: 19 mins remaining: Western Bulldogs 6-5 (41) vs Melbourne 9-6 (60) Back for the second half. Centre clearance for the Dogs but Petty takes a timely mark to centre-half back to nullify the threat. I’ll see what I can do. It’s been mostly the Dees but the Dogs struck back at the end of the second term to get within three goals and change. Melbourne can still go into half-time on good terms with themselves. They are winning the ball out of the middle, moving the ball well and defending the ground beautifully. The Bulldogs have looked off the pace but are still in it. On a plus note from their point of view, they can’t play much worse. If anyone is wondering why the Dees aren’t wearing their Indigenous jumper, it’s because of an apparent clash. Q2: 1 min remaining: Western Bulldogs 6-5 (41) vs Melbourne 9-6 (60) Goal! Crozier takes a nice contested mark from a kick-in before finding English with a measured pass inside 50. English converts from about 40 and suddenly the Dogs are back inside 20 points when they’ve looked outplayed for most of the night. Q2: 2 mins remaining: Western Bulldogs 5-4 (34) vs Melbourne 9-6 (60) Goal! Another messy inside 50 by the Dogs is handled easily by the Dees. But the Bulldogs soon regain control and work the ball across the ground before Daniel shoots and scores to pull one back. Much-needed late goal for the Bulldogs. Q2: 5 mins remaining: Western Bulldogs 4-4 (28) vs Melbourne 9-6 (60) Goal! The Dogs go backwards to go forward from defence but it’s hard work and the Dees soon turn the ball over. The pressure shows and Pickett gets onto the end of an Oliver pass inside 50 before kicking truly and putting more space between themselves and the Dogs. Q2: 7 mins remaining: Western Bulldogs 4-4 (28) vs Melbourne 8-6 (54) Lovely intercept mark by Rivers and again Melbourne nullify a Bulldogs move forward. The Dogs have been lacking for intent and the Dees are set up well. Q2: 10 mins remaining: Western Bulldogs 4-4 (28) vs Melbourne 8-6 (54) The Dogs go forward and Weightman looks set to pull off an audacious goal after a shimmy and then a shake but his snap misses to the left. Would’ve been a classic goal and a necessary one for the Dogs but to no avail. Q2: 12 mins remaining: Western Bulldogs 4-3 (27) vs Melbourne 8-6 (54) Goal! McDonald again. The Dogs have worked hard but the Demons are equal to it. Big Mac converts after some nice work from Neal-Bullen and now Melbourne regain their breathing space. Q2: 14 mins remaining: Western Bulldogs 4-3 (27) vs Melbourne 7-6 (48) Goal! Melbourne get one back after Petracca finds McDonald with a precise pass when everyone in the stadium - meaning no one - thought he might instead have gone for goal. Classy stuff from the Dee. Q2: 15 mins remaining: Western Bulldogs 4-3 (27) vs Melbourne 6-6 (42) Goal! English takes a virtually uncontested mark when he really should have had some opposition and makes no mistake with his set shot from 20m out. The Bont instrumental in that play. Warming into it he is. Q2: 16 mins remaining: Western Bulldogs 3-3 (21) vs Melbourne 6-6 (42) The Dogs are getting their hands on it now, tossing it around from defence to centre wing to the forward line. The Dees nullify but good signs for the Bulldogs. Q2: 18 mins remaining: Western Bulldogs 3-2 (20) vs Melbourne 6-5 (41) Goal! And Bruce does the rest, rocking back and drilling his set shot. Just the start the Bulldogs wanted. Q2: 19 mins remaining: Western Bulldogs 2-2 (14) vs Melbourne 6-5 (41) The Dogs trail at QT for the first time this season. Let’s see what they can do. Well, the second quarter has started with a clearance that has landed in the hands of Bruce... No fans but plenty of action as Melbourne start the game much stronger after their disappointment against the Crows last week. The Dees are winning it out of the middle and the rest has been taking care of itself. Response needed from the Dogs. Q1: 1 min remaining: Western Bulldogs 2-2 (14) vs Melbourne 6-5 (41) Goal! Lever to Oliver to Gawn, but Oliver is dumped after disposal and the Dees ruckman is handed a free in front of goal before splitting the big sticks to swell Melbourne’s lead. Big quarter from Melbourne. Q1: 3 mins remaining: Western Bulldogs 2-2 (14) vs Melbourne 5-5 (35) Another error in defence gives Melbourne a shot on goal but Spargo can’t convert from a tightish angle, missing to the left. Q1: 4 mins remaining: Western Bulldogs 2-2 (14) vs Melbourne 5-4 (34) Goal! Spargo has a set shot from the boundary but instead of having a crack he centres the ball and the Dogs fail to deal with the chaos ball as Jordon pounces and puts the Dees further in front. Q1: 6 mins remaining: Western Bulldogs 2-2 (14) vs Melbourne 4-4 (28) Goal! Big blue from the Dogs defence as Fritsch takes an intercept grab before spinning off the mark and snapping for another for the Dees. Q1: 8 mins remaining: Western Bulldogs 2-2 (14) vs Melbourne 3-3 (21) Goal! That man Naughton gets his hands on the ball just inside 50 and makes no mistake with his set shot. Timely goal for the Dogs. Q1: 10 mins remaining: Western Bulldogs 1-2 (8) vs Melbourne 3-3 (21) The Dees work the ball out of defence with some sharp passing. As the ball flies high over centre wing you really get the sense of no one being there. The stands are empty. Not even canned applause from the broadcasters. It’s like 2020 all over again. Please, God, let it be brief. Q1: 12 mins remaining: Western Bulldogs 1-1 (7) vs Melbourne 3-2 (20) Goal! Another quick break from Melbourne and the Dogs are caught unawares as Fritsch plays on and snaps truly to make it three for the Dees. Big start to the game from Melbourne. Q1: 14 mins remaining: Western Bulldogs 1-1 (7) vs Melbourne 2-1 (13) Goal! Big clearance win for the Bulldogs and Weightman judges a chaos ball best to find space and kick truly to drag one back. Lovely finish. Q1: 15 mins remaining: Western Bulldogs 0-1 (1) vs Melbourne 2-1 (13) Goal! From the kick-in the Dees regain possession and Petracca does the rest with an assured snap to put the Dees further in front. Q1: 16 mins remaining: Western Bulldogs 0-1 (1) vs Melbourne 1-1 (7) McDonald has space, then Fritsch has space, but the latter squanders his chance from the left as he drags his set shot to the left. Q1: 17 mins remaining: Western Bulldogs 0-1 (1) vs Melbourne 1-0 (6) Now Melbourne are on the attack. Clean hands from Bailey Smith on 50 gives the Dogs a shot on goal but the Dees talls are there to save the day. Q1: 19 mins remaining: Western Bulldogs 0-0 (0) vs Melbourne 1-0 (6) Goal! And we’re away. Gawn fairly well strips the ball from the centre bounce and before you know it Harmes pounces on a loose ball inside 50 and kicks a very, very quick goal. Wow, that was quick. Not long now... If you’ve been a bit busy and/or avoiding the crapness of Covid-19, this is the present state of crapness. In case anyone is unsure, Sir Doug Nicholls Round is about much more than a guernsey design tweak. Am I the only dude who thinks Bailey Smith is a dead ringer for Billy from Stranger Things? If anyone’s keen for a spot of background viewing, here’s some highlights of the last time these two met. And even more recently, if you know what I mean. Don’t sit on the fence, HoO. Worst case you’re a 50-50 shot. I’m with the Dogs. Lest anyone be under a rock, Victoria is back in a very dark place. Please, please let it be brief. Western Bulldogs B: Taylor Duryea, Alex Keath, Hayden Crozier HB: Bailey Williams, Zaine Cordy, Caleb Daniel C: Bailey Dale, Tom Liberatore, Jason Johannisen HF: Lachie Hunter, Josh Bruce, Cody Weightman F: Tim English, Aaron Naughton, Marcus Bontempelli FOLL: Jordon Sweet, Jack Macrae, Bailey Smith I/C: Patrick Lipinski, Lachlan McNeil, Roarke Smith, Riley Garcia Sub: Louis Butler Melbourne B: Jayden Hunt, Steven May, Jake Lever HB: Christian Salem, Harrison Petty, Michael Hibberd C: Angus Brayshaw, Christian Petracca, Ed Langdon HF: James Jordon, Tom McDonald, Jake Melksham F: Bayley Fritsch, Sam Weideman, Charlie Spargo FOLL: Max Gawn, Clayton Oliver, Kysaiah Pickett I/C: James Harmes, Luke Jackson, Trent Rivers, Alex Neal-Bullen Sub: Tom Sparrow A battle of the midfield, to be sure. And it sure helps to get a run for the Dogs if your first name is Bailey. Here’s one of them. The one with the big hair. Good evening and welcome to the opening fixture of the Sir Doug Nicholls Round. It’s one that was touch-and-go to even go ahead and one that will proceed in the absence of spectators. Thankfully it is indeed happening. Not often do we see a 1-v-2 in round 11 of the season but that’s what we have on our hands tonight. Its lustre might have been brighter had Melbourne beaten Adelaide last week and come into this contest unbeaten, but let’s be grateful for what we’ve got. This is still a Friday night worth staying in for, and let’s face it if you’re in Victoria you’ve got no choice anyway. So fill the fridge full of VB/Kombucha/Yakult and strap yourselves in for a match that will reveal more and more about the supposed leading lights for this year’s premiership. This is a real chance for both teams. It’s a chance for the Bulldogs to prove without a shadow of doubt that they are the real deal, the finest outfit in the AFL. Beat the Demons and that cannot be in dispute. Should Melbourne bounce back, however, we’ll likely be back in the murky waters of ambiguity. All of which, it must be said, is tempered by the fact it is only round 11 and Covid-19 could still resurface to bite all and sundry on the derriere. But that can wait. All that matters is a top-of-the-table clash and a Friday night to savour. I’m here to keep you posted. You’re here, among other duties, to keep me company. If you’d like to get involved, you know the drill. Let’s do this thing.","charCount":"13305","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/scott-heinrich\">Scott Heinrich</a>"},{"headline":"Japan expected to extend emergency Covid measures less than two months ahead of Olympics","standfirst":"<p>Medical officials say case numbers in Tokyo need to be much lower to prevent another surge during the Games</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul>","trailText":"Medical officials say case numbers in Tokyo need to be much lower to prevent another surge during the Games","byline":"Justin McCurry in Tokyo","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"44fec9b1be58b33e253310a506ea3ed3e335b4f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44fec9b1be58b33e253310a506ea3ed3e335b4f4/0_191_5734_3441/1000.jpg\" alt=\"FILES-OLY-US-JAPAN-HEALTH-VIRUS(FILES) In this file photo taken on May 18, 2021, security guards keep watch next to the Olympic Rings while people take part in a protest against the hosting of the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games, in front of the headquarters building of the Japanese Olympic Committee in Tokyo. - The United States warned its citizens on May 24, 2021 not to travel to Olympic host Japan, citing the growing risk of the Covid-19 pandemic in the Asian nation just two months before the Games begin.

The state of emergency – the third in the capital since the start of the pandemic – was called in late April and was originally due to end on 11 May, but was extended until the end of this month, as restrictions on businesses failed to make a dent in infections. The latest extension is scheduled to end on 20 June, just over a month before the Olympics are due to begin.

In other news, Liverpool have signed a defender, Ibrahima Konaté from RB Leipzig. From Liverpool’s press release. The 22-year-old defender has agreed a long-term contract with the Reds from July 1, subject to international clearance and a successful work permit application process, after finalising terms and passing a medical. Konate said: “I’m really happy to be joining such a massive club like Liverpool. “It’s a really exciting moment for me and my family and I am really looking forward to meeting my new teammates, the staff and getting started on this new chapter. “Right now, my focus is on the U21 European Championships with France, but after this competition I know I will be joining one of the best teams in the world and that gives me a great feeling.” Time for a toblerone so I’ll hand back to John Brewin... Recent Champions League finals between sides from the same country. The smart money says Man City v Chelsea could go beyond 90 minutes. Milan 0-0 Juventus (Milan won on pens) Man Utd 1-1 Chelsea (Man Utd won on pens) Bayern 2-1 Borussia Dortmund Real Madrid 1-1 Atletico Madrid (4-1 after ET) Liverpool 2-0 Tottenham Thankfully, Wayne Rooney didn’t ‘Steve Morrow’ Paul Scholes. A nice lunchtime sports quiz sprinkled with a bit of football. No excuses for getting under 6 out of 10. Sunday morning as Tuchel celebrates (see 12:05 entry). “Guten Tag, Roman. Ich habe viele Toblerones gegessen vier insgesamt. Ich habe vier weissen ubrig, weil ich die weissen nicht gerne esse und habe die dunklen lieber.” Another stat to mull over. Chelsea a ‘bogey’ team? In his entire managerial career, Man City manager Pep Guardiola has lost more matches against Chelsea in all competitions than any other club (7). He has lost his last two games against the Blues, only losing three in a row against Real Madrid (2012-14) and Liverpool (2018). Tuchel not a drinker but looks like he could demolish a few Ritter Sport if all goes well. A celebratory drive to Düsseldorf in his bare feet perhaps? From our fun facts piece by Michael Butler: After victories I’m prone to all kinds of messes: chocolate, peanuts, chips. Fast food only very rarely. Something special must have happened there. And it has to be dark, otherwise I can’t get fast food down. Surely Phil Foden and Bernado Silva have to start if Pep reads his glossy Champions League Opta stat pack. Since featuring in a 2-1 defeat to Lyon in September 2018, Manchester City’s Bernardo Silva is unbeaten in his last 26 UEFA Champions League matches (W23 D3) – the longest unbeaten run in the history of the competition. His team-mate Phil Foden is on the second-longest current run, unbeaten in 21 matches (W18 D3) since playing in a defeat to Basel in March 2018. It’s not just the Simpsons that predicts the future. Just under 36 years before Manchester United and Villarreal were deadlocked after 90 minutes, here’s another big, fancied English team being held by Spanish minnows in a European final. Surely this Basora character should have gone for that tackle. Petr &gt; Didier when it comes to drawing. Managerial vacancies now at three big clubs. And Tottenham. Juve, Real Madrid and Inter all sifting through candidates. If the bookies are to be believed, it’s Antonio Conte (8/11) to Real and Mauricio Pochettino (4/11) back to Spurs. Massimiliano Allegri is also being heavily linked with a return to Juventus. Talking of the Super League, Juventus have announced the departure of head coach Andrea Pirlo after just one season in charge. Finishing fourth after nine successive titles just didn’t cut it. Here’s the goodbye on the official Juventus website. Are you sitting comfortably children?... Thanks Andrea. These are the first words that all of us must pronounce at the end of this special experience lived together. A few months ago Andrea Pirlo, an icon of world football, began a new adventure on the Juventus bench, his first as a coach. To do this, first of all it takes courage, as well as awareness of one’s own means, especially in a period marked by many difficulties, with the world forced by the pandemic to reinvent its own rules day after day. Andrea did it too: he started (and we are sure of this: his will be a brilliant career as a coach) a journey of transformation, seeking, and often managing, to bring his ideas and his experience as a champion on the pitch from the “Other side” of the barricade. For the courage, the dedication, the passion with which he demonstrated every day, our thanks go to the ‘Maestro’, the coach and to Andrea, that really comes from the heart, as well as our good luck for the future that will surely be a wonderful one. Well, no-one thought this was going to just Fade Away... We’ve heard from Noel but nothing yet from Liam about the Champions League final. At least he didn’t miss this open goal after Wednesday night’s events in Gdansk. David Tindall here now. While John goes off to eat cake after putting the thought in his mind, I’ll take the blog for a while. They will probably hold off the chocolate cake for tonight. Plenty of time for that on Sunday. Saturday night in the Estádio do Dragão will all be about mentality, and Ben Welch’s piece for the Blizzard, carried in these pages, hears from psychologists and players who share their tips for staying self-assured. The rest of the Premier League will look on at City and Chelsea with gimlet eyes, but the transfer window is about to be prised open. Manchester United look like early market movers, though we probably say that every year. Noel Gallagher has been talking to the BBC about Manchester City and, well, himself. What Manchester City have done is exactly what the owners said would happen. When they came in and said they were determined to turn us into one of the biggest clubs in Europe and the world, all I was thinking was, I don’t care what you do, as long as that banner comes down at Old Trafford, the one showing how long we’d been without a trophy. I remember meeting [City chairman] Khaldoon Al Mubarak at the start and telling him that and he was adamant, saying ‘oh no no no, it’s going to be much greater than that’. I was like ‘whatever’ but my God they have been true to their word and it has just been an amazing journey that the club has been on. It feels like quite a neat anniversary - we’ve had 10 years of the High Flying Birds and 10 years of City in the Champions League. Not only that but it’s my birthday on Saturday and I’m going to be in Porto, so it’s a big day all round. And here’s the brilliant Barney Ronay on Kevin De Bruyne, the main man for Manchester City. De Bruyne will turn 30 next month. He’s about to play his 494th professional game. To date he has three Premier League titles, an FA Cup and five League Cups, which is certainly a lot of League Cups. He has been player of the year in England, Germany and Belgium, but never above ninth spot in the Ballon d’Or. This will be Manchester City’s second European final. Remembering Big Mal, Joe Mercer, the other Neil Young with those who were in Vienna in 1970, including City stalwart Tommy Booth. Jacob Steinberg dove deeply into Tactics Tom ahead of the final. Great piece. Saturday is also upon us, and it will be a tremendous day of red hot soccer. Brentford and Swansea, two teams who play the game the ‘right’ way will serve as an hors d’oeuvre for the evening’s events in Porto when they play in the EFL Championship play-off final. It will be a match when every kick can be measured by how much money it might cost, football divined right down to the pecuniary. Talking of which, can Manchester City reach the holy grail of winning the competition their owners set out to win on buying the club in 2008 or will Roman Abramovich celebrate success for the second time, having set out a similar target five years before. Setting aside such cynicism, both games promise so much with Thomas Tuchel seeming to have Pep Guardiola’s number so far this season and Swansea and Brentford drew both their games 1-1 in the regular season.

Whitchurch High School – someone had e’d you about its interesting (I’d say amazing) record for producing sporting stars – mentioning Gareth Bale, but without adding both Geraint Thomas (Tour de France winner, also a second place, yes?) and Sam Warburton (Wales and Lions rugby captain). All within 2 or 3 years, I believe. And it’s a proper STATE school! Re Durham LBW’s yesterday – even more extraordinary seems the total number of LBW’s given, Essex ones included – 11 in all by my count. Now is that a record, or what?” In my book all state schools should have a proper playing field, even if that means requisitioning land from next door office buildings or building new schools elsewhere. Even if pupils hate sport they can benefit from sitting in a green environment at lunchtime with all the benefits we know that brings. I defy you to listen to this and not have a little cry.

The tone that director Stephanie Zari is going for seems to be that blend of violence and black humour that Fargo and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/27/jump-the-shark-killing-eve\">Killing Eve</a> make look so easy. But Zebra Girl’s quirky comedy is not quite distinctive enough, and the script lurches iffily into serious issues of child abuse and mental illness in the second half.</p> <p>Sarah Roy plays the murderer, Catherine, who grabs a knife from the cutlery drawer after catching husband Dan (Tom Cullen) watching unpleasant porn at 3am in the study of their country pile. A shrieky horror movie score blares as she does the deed and afterwards she wraps a fluffy pink towel around his head. The next morning, she calls in childhood friend Anita (Jade Anouka), who is shocked – but not exactly surprised – to walk in on a murder scene. It turns out that Catherine’s plummily posh private school accent and Tory chic fashion taste (pink cashmere knits and pearl earrings) are an affectation.

The tone that director Stephanie Zari is going for seems to be that blend of violence and black humour that Fargo and Killing Eve make look so easy. But Zebra Girl’s quirky comedy is not quite distinctive enough, and the script lurches iffily into serious issues of child abuse and mental illness in the second half. Sarah Roy plays the murderer, Catherine, who grabs a knife from the cutlery drawer after catching husband Dan (Tom Cullen) watching unpleasant porn at 3am in the study of their country pile. A shrieky horror movie score blares as she does the deed and afterwards she wraps a fluffy pink towel around his head. The next morning, she calls in childhood friend Anita (Jade Anouka), who is shocked – but not exactly surprised – to walk in on a murder scene. It turns out that Catherine’s plummily posh private school accent and Tory chic fashion taste (pink cashmere knits and pearl earrings) are an affectation. What’s also clear is that she’s a psychopath without a trace of conscience. “Help me bag this bastard up,” she snaps at Anita. Even with the deadpan one-liners she’s not an interesting or layered character. In flashback we see Catherine and university lecturer Dan meet and fall in love.

Groups are limited to six people from six households while two metres social distancing is required for audiences, as well as performers if it’s practical. PA Media reports that Welsh government guidance says there must be “effective ventilation,” one-way systems and people should continue to wear masks indoors. A single-shot coronavirus vaccine from Johnson &amp; Johnson has been approved for use in the UK. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, welcomed the news. He said: “This is a further boost to the UK’s hugely successful vaccination programme, which has already saved over 13,000 lives, and means that we now have four safe and effective vaccines approved to help protect people from this awful virus. “As Janssen is a single-dose vaccine, it will play an important role in the months to come as we redouble our efforts to encourage everyone to get their jabs and potentially begin a booster programme later this year.” Case numbers in Glasgow remain “uncomfortably high” Sturgeon says, as infection numbers have risen by 30% from 112 per 100,000 to 146 per 100,000. She says she’ll confirm on Wednesday next week at the latest whether it will move from level 3 to level 2 if numbers continue to stabilise and hospitalisations don’t increase. The India variant was accounting for half of new cases in the city. If approved, changes will come into effect from 5 June. The first minister encouraged people to come forward for the vaccine, and saying that young people can be badly affected. A decision to move the mainland Scotland from level 2 to level 1 on 7 June will be confirmed on Tuesday, she says. “Weighing up all these different factors is inevitably really difficult. Case numbers in Glasgow are uncomfortably high but we are seeing signs of progress. “My message to the people of Glasgow is don’t lose heart, on the contrary take heart from the progress we are seeing. I live in Glasgow so I know how hard this is from my own personal life, continue to help with all the public health efforts, because if we continue to do this we will move from level 3 to level 2.” Sturgeon says the outbreak is concentrated amongst younger age groups, giving hope that the vaccination process is being effective in protecting older people. “We are monitoring very carefully, whether and to what extend, the vaccine is breaking or weakening the link between case numbers and cases of serious illness and death,” she said. Scotland’s first minister is giving a briefing on the latest situation in Scotland with Covid. She says that 3,196,051 have had their first dose and 1,971,006 have had both jabs. Case numbers are on the rise, with Friday having the highest figures since 25 March and the R number being as high as 1.3. Sturgeon goes on to add that there is “cause for concern” with outbreaks in Glasgow and that Scotland is entering a “transition phase” that allows the country to deal with the virus which people have a much greater sense of normality. The Covid case rates in Scotland and Northern Ireland have seen a large increase, according to the latest report by the Office for National Statistics. Infections up to 22 May in Scotland rose from 1 in 1,960 people to 1 in 630, and a similar increase was seen in Northern Ireland from 1 in 1,550 to 1 in 820. The study found potential signs of an increase in England, and that the India variant is becoming more prevalent. The rate in England is 1 in 1,120, and Wales is the lowest in the UK with 1 in 3,850. It found that it was detecting more cases of the India variant. It says: “In the week ending 22 May 2021, the percentage of people testing positive that are not compatible with B.1.1.7 (the UK variant) increased in England and Scotland, remained low in Wales and the trend was uncertain in Northern Ireland. These are likely to be compatible with the variant B.1.617.2, first identified in India.” The study, done alongside Oxford University, Manchester University, Public Health England and the Wellcome Trust is of positive tests in private homes in the UK, rather than those in hospitals or care homes. The percentage of people testing positive for coronavirus continues to be low at 0.09%, but there are potential signs of an increase since early May, when the percentage was 0.07%, the ONS said. It says: “Infection rates remain low across the UK compared with earlier months in the year. In England, there are signs of a potential increase in the two weeks ending 22 May 2021. In Wales, the percentage of people testing positive continues to be very low, which makes it difficult to identify trends since they are more easily affected by small changes in the number of people testing positive from week-to-week. “In the week ending 22 May 2021, there are early signs of a potential increase in the percentage of people testing positive in Northern Ireland and levels have increased in Scotland.” Relations between Boris Johnson and Simon Case, the head of the civil service, have plunged into mistrust after former top aide Dominic Cummings’ evidence to two select committees on Wednesday, the Financial Times reports. Cummings told the hearing that he had brought in Case to be permanent secretary as he believed the prime minister was no longer listening to him on Covid-19. Five well-placed figures in the civil service said relations between Johnson and Case were precarious, in part due to his ties to the former Downing Street adviser. One government insider said: “Number 10 are deeply suspicious that he’s not on side.” On Thursday, two officials said there were concerns across Whitehall over Case’s links to Cummings. One government insider said “the mood in the cabinet secretary’s camp is very low” following the hearing. Another added that “he [Case] is clearly worried about what Dom might say next”. But one senior Number 10 official said they “absolutely did not recognise that characterisation”, adding “the cabinet secretary and the prime minister have an excellent working relationship”. More from Kwasi Kwarteng’s morning broadcast round here, as he said care home residents were sufficiently protected. The UK business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, has defended Matt Hancock against criticism that he failed to protect people in care homes at the outset of the Covid pandemic, saying residents “were protected as far as we could”. The health secretary is under mounting pressure after Dominic Cummings accused him of promising ministers that all care residents in England were tested before being discharged back to their homes and then lying about this. On Thursday, Hancock denied the allegation but his explanation that it “wasn’t possible” to test all care home residents before they were discharged from hospital last March because the testing capacity was not yet available, has been called into question. Kwarteng said it was “very easy with hindsight” to say where things could have been improved. “I completely understand the anger and frustration about care homes, because a large number of people died, and it was a terrible situation,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “I think what Mr Hancock said was very clear. He’s always maintained that he wanted to build up the testing capacity. I think he was largely successful in that.” In Northern Ireland, new Ulster Unionist party (UUP) leader Doug Beattie has called for disillusioned Democratic Unionist party (DUP) members to join his party amid a potential schism after Edwin Poots was confirmed as its new leader. Beattie said they had an “awful lot to offer as politicians” and he would welcome them if they decided to defect. He added that no MLAs had approached him, according to PA Media, but conversations had been had with a few individuals. It comes as Poots was confirmed as the DUP’s new leader on Thursday, after Arlene Foster was ousted earlier this year. One member told the BBC that the meeting where Poots was ratified was the worst he had attended in 40 years as a member. Several leading DUP politicians left after the vote, before Poots made his speech. Beattie said: “Our door is always open to people who want to come to the Ulster Unionist Party, but if they want to do so they come understanding the Ulster Unionist Party values and I will talk to them and anyone who wants to come to make sure they understand that before I offer them the ability to join. “If we bring anyone in, and we are a welcoming party, it must be going in our direction, seeing Northern Ireland through our eyes.” Surgical hubs should be created across England and the government should spend £1bn annually for the next five years to reduce the “colossal” backlog in non-urgent procedures, the Royal College of Surgeons has said. The recommendations are two of a dozen suggestions made by the RCS designed to ensure planned surgery can continue safely if the country is hit again by another wave of coronavirus, a new variant or a severe winter/flu outbreak. All elective or planned surgery, such as for knee and hip replacements, was cancelled in the first wave of the pandemic. The latest figures show that in March, 4.95 million people were waiting for hospital treatment in England – the largest figure on record – including 436,127 people waiting more than a year a year. Away from Covid, ex-MP George Galloway announced yesterday that he is set to run in the Batley and Spen byelection on 1 July. Galloway, whose party All For Unity got 0.9% of the vote in the recent Scottish parliament elections, said he was standing in protest against Labour leader Keir Starmer. Labour has selected Kim Leadbeater, the sister of Jo Cox who was MP for the seat when she was murdered in 2016, as it hopes to avoid a repeat of their defeat in Hartlepool in May. Leeds councillor Ryan Stephenson has been chosen as the Conservative party candidate. Pressure is growing on the government to begin the public inquiry into its handling of the Covid pandemic, days after the prime minister’s former top adviser Dominic Cummings said any delay was “completely terrible”. Our social affairs correspondent, Robert Booth has more: Boris Johnson is facing a growing clamour to bring forward the start of the coronavirus public inquiry after Dominic Cummings’ allegations triggered a “political pantomime” that disrespects the victims of the pandemic, their relatives said. The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group, which represents thousands of grieving people, called for an urgent start to the inquiry, which is due to begin in spring 2022. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) joined the call, alongside Lord Kerslake, the former head of the civil service under David Cameron, Angela Rayner, the deputy Labour leader, and Ed Davey, the leader of the Liberal Democrats. Welcome to today’s UK coronavirus liveblog, as Boris Johnson faces calls to push back the relaxing of rules on 21 June in England over fears about a third wave from the India variant. Both Independent Sage member Christina Pagel and business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng were cautious when they spoke to breakfast programmes this morning. Pagel told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme this morning: “So far we’ve kind of been crossing our fingers a little bit, Sage and Public Health England both say it’s a more transmissible variant, we know it has some levels of vaccine escape. “So we’re in a situation where, compared to two months ago, we now have a dominant variant, it transmits faster, and our vaccines are less effective against it.” Speaking to Sky News, Kwarteng said the number of cases was a “matter of concern”. He added: “We don’t want to proceed with the roadmap without considering all the information that we have. Today’s the 28th of May.

New GDP data released this morning showed that French GDP shrank by 0.1% in January-March, rather than the 0.4% growth that was first reported. That follows a 1.5% contraction in the last three months of 2020, meaning France has joined the wider eurozone in recession as the Covid-19 pandemic hit the region’s economy. It means France’s economy is 4.7% smaller than in the fourth quarter of 2019, before the pandemic. Statistics body INSEE cuts its GDP estimate after finding that France’s construction output was much weaker than early data had shown. It also reports that real disposable income of households fell by 1.0% in the first quarter while the savings rate dipped to 21.8% from a revised 22.7% at the end of 2020. The downgrade is a blow to president Macron, who had resisted pressure from health experts to announce new lockdown measures until mid-March, when surging infections and hospitalisations forced the government to impose restrictions in Paris and parts of Northern France. A country-wide lockdown was announced at the end of March, in an attempt to curb a dramatic surge in Covid-19 cases that threatened to overwhelm hospitals. Those closures of non-essential shops and schools, and restrictions on travel (along with ongoing hospitality closures) have now hit the economy. INSEE reports that household spending - a key driver of growth - fell by 8.3% in April. France’s lockdown is now being eased, and the government is hopeful of recovery this year, as Reuters explains: COVID-19 restrictions are now being unwound in France. Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire on Thursday stuck to his growth forecast of 5% for 2021 and said the crisis was “moving behind us, though we must remain cautious”. The wider eurozone shrank by 0.6% in the first quarter of the year, according to preliminary data, while Germany contracted by 1.8%. Alex Kuptsikevich, FxPro senior financial analyst, flags up that inflation pressures are rising, alongside the jump in consumer confidence. The Eurozone consumer confidence index confirmed at -5.1 in May. This is the highest level since the end of 2018 and is amongst the top 20% of all-time highs since 1985. Against this background, it is not surprising to see new highs in the European stock indices. Inflation expectations are contributing to this push upwards in indices sentiment, as this is seen as a positive factor, suggesting that people will spend more soon. However, investors and households are worried that inflation may eat into income levels, as the driver of price increases in commodity prices rather than wage and service growth. Earlier today, German Destatis noted a double-digit inflation rate in import prices for the first time since 2010. Besides the low base effect, we note a 6.6% price increase since the start of the year, so it looks like a further stage of inflation. The long-running problem of loyal customers being charged more than new ones should finally be over. The UK’s financial watchdog has stamped down on the ‘loyalty penalty’; from next January, car and home insurance renewal quotes may not be more expensive than those offered to new customers. This will prevent customers who stick with their insurer being quietly squeezed, but might also mean fewer cut-price deals aimed at those who shop around. Our Money editor Hilary Osborne explains: Customers who renew their home or motor insurance will not be charged more than new policyholders after the financial watchdog put an end to companies charging a loyalty penalty. People who automatically renew their policy with their insurer are often charged higher premiums than new customers, who tend to be offered the best deals. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) found that on average new customers paid £285 a year for motor insurance, while customers who had been with their provider for more than five years were charged £370. In the home insurance market, new customers paid £165 a year for buildings and contents cover, while after five years, premiums had increased to £287. It said its ban on the practice of price walking, where insurance premiums go up as a matter of course year on year rather than because the risk is higher, would save consumers £4.2bn over 10 years. Here’s the full story: Ian Mason, head of UK financial services regulation at law firm Gowling WLG, has welcomed the move: “This is a welcome move by the FCA to protect consumers, so that existing customers are offered the same deals when renewing their insurance as new customers. The FCA is increasingly focusing on firms providing fair outcomes for consumers, and this is in line with that trend”. Twitter has listed a new paid-for “Twitter Blue” service on app stores, suggesting the social media company may launch its long-rumoured subscription service soon. Mobile phone app stores showed the service, although its expected features did not yet appear to be available. A subscription plan has long been expected as Twitter looks for more ways to make money from its large user base. In April, the company said it had 199 million users from whom it could make money every day, a 20% year-on-year increase. On Apple’s App Store Twitter lists “Twitter Blue” under in-app purchases for £2.49 in the UK and $2.99 in the US store. On the Android store the Twitter listing shows “in-app purchases” but does not list pricing for the service. The economic confidence report also shows that inflation expectations are building as the European economy pick up. Consumer price expectations increased further in May, for the fifth month in a row, and above the long-term average - showing people are bracing for higher inflation over the coming year. Those concerns seem justified. European businesses said they expect to be lifting their prices over the next 12 months. Selling price expectations among manufacturers, who have been hit by the surge in commodity prices and transports, hit a record. The survey says: Selling price expectations saw the third month of marked and uniform increases across all surveyed business sectors, i.e. industry, services, retail trade and construction, reaching an all-time high in industry. Here’s some reaction to the rise in eurozone economic confidence, from ING’s Bert Colijn... ...and Howard Archer of EY Item Club. Economic confidence across the eurozone has hit a three-year high, as optimism over the recovery from the pandemic rises. It was lifted by a jump in sentiment at service sector firms, retailers and among consumers, as Covid-19 restrictions are eased, new data from from the European Commission shows. The EC’s index of eurozone economic sentiment has jumped to 114.5 points in May from 110.5 in April, higher than expected, and close to its December 2017 peak. It also rose strongly in the wider EU, up 4 points to 113.9. These readings are “markedly above its long-term average and pre-pandemic level”, says the EC, with employment expectations also rising. Optimism in the services sector rose the most, and broke above its long-term average for the first time since March last year - jumping from 2.2 to 11.3 in the euro area. The report explains: Managers expressed more positive views on the past business situation and past demand, and were more optimistic on demand expectations. Consumer confidence increased for the fourth time in a row (+3.0), driven by an improvement in all its components (i.e. views on their household’s past and future financial situation, their expectations of the general economic situation in their country, and their intentions to make major purchases). Industry confidence increased for the sixth month in a row, with managers reporting strong order books and improved export demand. Retail trade confidence rose for the third time in a row (+2.8), and construction confidence improved (+1.9), as managers reported improved order books and more optimistic employment expectations. Back on Joe Biden’s budget proposal...CNBC say the president is proposing $5tn in new federal spending over the next 10 years. President Joe Biden will propose $5 trillion in new federal spending over the next decade on Friday, part of his fiscal year 2022 budget request, a source familiar with the proposal tells CNBC. The new spending would be paid for in part by $3.6 trillion in additional revenues over the same period. The result would be a net deficit of $1.4 trillion, which would begin shrinking after 2030. Biden will include $300 billion of the $5 trillion total in his budget request to Congress for fiscal year 2022. This will bring the president’s total budget request for next year to $6 trillion, the source said. European stocks have hit a new all-time high, as optimism over the economic recovery continues to lift share prices across the region. The Europe-wide Stoxx 600 index has gained 0.45% this morning to 448.45 points, a fresh record. Every sector is higher, led by financials, industrial stocks and utilities. The Stoxx 600 has now gained over 12% so far this year, amid optimism that Europe’s economy will rebound strongly from the pandemic - now that Covid-19 vaccination programs have picked up speed. Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC are both up around 0.4%. Recent European economic data has shown activity is picking up strongly, with business growth hitting a three-year high this month and the EC upgrading its own growth forecasts. America’s strong recovery, and president Biden’s spending plans, are also providing a lift. Frédérique Carrier, Head of Investment Strategy, RBC Wealth Management, says the European economy is reviving faster than most observers expected. Europe, where many countries had to extend lockdown measures, is finally emerging from a long economic winter thanks to lower infection rates and an accelerating vaccine rollout. Carrier has upgraded her view on European equities to ‘overweight’, predicting they will see a ‘conducive climate’ over the next six to 12 months. She writes: As macroeconomic momentum builds, earnings delivery is strong and both management and consensus forecasts are being revised upwards. The Q1 reporting season was exceptionally robust, with companies in the Euro STOXX Index, an index of some 300 European companies, easily beating consensus expectations and generating earnings per share growth of close to 40 percent year over year, driven by sales increases and margin expansion. Moreover, management teams overall were optimistic on a demand recovery, though some noted concerns regarding supply shortages. Most were confident of their pricing power and ability to reduce costs. Following a heady Q1, upgraded forecasts suggest the earnings recovery is likely to last into next year. The consensus is looking for earnings growth of around 15 percent year over year for 2022. In the City, the blue-chip FTSE 100 index has risen 30 points to 7050 points, up 0.45%. Top risers include energy firm SSE (+2.6%), and UK housebuilders Taylor Wimpey (+2.5%), Barratt Development (+2.4%) and Persimmon (+2.1%). Luxury fashion group Burberry (+2.5%), and financial stocks such as HSBC (+2.4%) and Prudential (+2.4%) are also higher this morning. Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor, says the prospect of higher inflation is pushing the market up. “Further signs that the US economy is beginning to run hot prompted another switch into value stocks, at the expense of growth. The renewed consideration of cyclical stocks as an investment destination has generally played into the hands of the FTSE100, which has now risen by 9% in the year to date. The index is replete with sectors falling into the recovery category, such as the banks, oils and miners. For the likes of the airlines and the hospitality sectors, however, the outlook remains rather more cloudy as both travel restrictions and the emergence of Covid-19 variants hinder a smooth return to some sort of normality. The US stock market is expected to open higher later today. The Dow Jones industrial average up around 0.5% in pre-market trading, adding to yesterday’s 0.4% gain. Australia’s benchmark stock index, the S&amp;P/ASX 200, has hit a record closing high today, amid renewed optimism in the global economic outlook and the prospect of a $6tn Biden budget. The mining sector was leading the gains with financials, energy, industrials and consumer staples also higher. Higher US spending could mean greater demand for commodities and a wider boost to growth. This lifted the index to its highest close, and near the intraday high hit early in the pandemic. The Australian Financial Review reports: A sharp rally in domestic miners and energy stocks drove the S&amp;P/ASX 200 Index to a fresh closing high of 7179.5, rising 84.6 points, or 1.2 per cent, on Friday amid speculation that US President Joe Biden is planning an infrastructure friendly $6 trillion budget. Shares exceeded their May 10 record of 7172.8 points, but not the intraday high of 7197 set on February 20, 2020. Asian stocks have put global equities on course for a seventh day of gains today as investors bet the U.S. will lead the world out of the COVID-19 pandemic, points out Reuters. While Japan’s Nikkei led the way with a 2.1% jump, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 0.3% earlier today. The MSCI world equity index added 0.1% to 709.71, nearing the all-time closing high of 710.36 set on May 7. However, China’s CSI 300 index dipped by 0.3%. Kyle Rodda of IG explains why president Biden’s budget plans have lifted spirits: Given its sensitivity to swings in the business cycle, commodity prices and global trade, Asia’s financial markets could arguably be said to benefit most from a big spending US fiscal package. As much seemed to manifest in the region’s stock markets today: Asia’s benchmark indices have generally put in solid rallies to end the month – with the notable exception of Chinese stocks, which have traded flat – as markets discount the possibility of another pump-priming of global growth by the US. The export sensitive Nikkei has been the noteworthy outperformer, despite Japan extending its state of emergency today. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Global stock markets are nudging higher as investors brace for president Joe Biden to propose a $6tn spending package when he unveils his first budget later today. Biden is expected to propose record federal spending of $6tn in the 2022 financial year, starting in October, rising to $8.2 trillion by 2031, according to a report in the New York Times. Citing documents it had obtained, the NYT said the Democratic president planned to pay for his agenda through increased taxes on corporations and high earners, with budget deficits expected to decrease in the 2030s. The budget will show how Biden intends to deliver on his sweeping domestic agenda. That includes the American Jobs Plan to build new transport, water, energy and broadband infrastructure, modernise homes, and boost manufacturing, and the American Families Plan to invest more in childcare and education. The budget will also outline how the White House see inflation, employment, and economic growth panning out. The budget deficit is expected to hit $1.8tn in 2022. But the documents will also be aspirational. Biden’s Democrats hold only narrow majorities in the House and Senate, and the Republicans are pushing for a smaller infrastructure package instead. So a pitched battle lies ahead. As Reuters explains: Republicans have criticized the president for seeking trillions in new spending, setting the stage for pitched battles over his priorities. “It just seems like the trillions keep on coming,” Republican U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito, who is leading a group of colleagues pursuing a counteroffer to Biden’s current $1.7 trillion infrastructure proposal. Yesterday, president Biden told an event in Cleveland that it’s the right time to invest in the economic recovery: “Now is the time to build (upon) the foundation that we’ve laid to make bold investments in our families and our communities and our nation. We know from history that these kinds of investments raise both the floor and the ceiling over the economy for everybody.” Hailing the recent progress against Covid-19, Biden added: “We’ve turned the tide on the once-in-a-century pandemic. “And now we’re faced with a question: what kind of economy are we going to build for tomorrow? What are we going to do? I believe this is our moment to rebuild an economy from the bottom up and the middle out.” Asia-Pacific equity markets have been boosted overnight, with Japan’s Nikkei jumping 2.1% and South Korea’s Kospi gaining 0.8%. Investors anticipate that this surge in US spending will feed through to the global economy, as Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at OANDA, explains: President Biden’s Preliminary Budget is envisaging a $1.8 trillion deficit next year, after tax rises. Of course, what the President would like, and what he will get from Congress could be quite different, but with that level of spending, Asia appears to feel that some of that goody bag will fall their way, and Asian equity markets have risen today Strong economic data yesterday is also supporting stocks, with the number of new US jobless claims falling to a pandemic low yesterday, and US growth confirmed at a pacy 1.6% in the last quarter (while the UK and eurozone contracted). Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote, says: A robust GDP growth in the first quarter, a fresh pandemic low print in weekly jobless claims and the talk of a $6 trillion federal spending package for the coming fiscal year boosted appetite in most equities and the US dollar. But could inflation fears spoil the party again? Later today we get the latest ‘core PCE price’ index -- the US Federal Reserve’s preferred gauge of inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices. It’s expected to jump to 2.9% on a yearly basis from 1.8%. The University of Michigan’s final consumer morale index for May is likely to highlight that inflation worries are hitting confidence (as the preliminary report showed earlier this month).

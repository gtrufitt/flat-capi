One of the journalists, Molly Hennessy-Fiske, tweeted that she is seeking ‚Äúinformation and accountability‚Äù for the state patrol ‚Äúattacking us while we were covering protests a year ago.‚Äù NYT seeks ‚Äòhard fact‚Äô editor to oversee weddings coverage, fact-check dating claims Most media job postings don‚Äôt get much attention. But a new job listing from the Styles section of The New York Times was unusually candid. The paper is seeking a new editor for weddings coverage who is ‚Äúhighly skilled at hard fact editing.‚Äù ‚ÄúListen,‚Äù the listing read, ‚ÄúIf you think that the D.C. bureau or the politics desk deals with people lying to them or hiding facts, wait till you start asking someone about their dating history.‚Äù Some readers who have personally submitted wedding announcements to the Times confirmed that the fact-checking process was unusually intense (though, as others noted, not without slip-ups.) And others noted that the job listing sounded like a pretty good premise for a romantic comedy. Cate Doty, a former New York Times weddings writer, has a just-published new memoir dishing about the inside drama of the Times‚Äô wedding section. Michigan‚Äôs Democratic secretary of state, Jocelyn Benson, was on the front lines of the protests and election disinformation fueled by Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúbig lie‚Äù about election fraud as the battleground state‚Äôs chief election official. In a new interview with the Associated Press, Benson warns that the ongoing disputes and conspiracy theories around the 2020 election are only the beginning of what she sees as a sustained attack on American democracy that will culminate in a renewed attack on election legitimacy in 2024. Here‚Äôs a key exchange from the full interview: AP: Across the country, we are seeing several GOP-controlled legislatures seeking to exert more control over election officials. How concerned are you that we could end up seeing more of these outside ballot reviews like in Arizona or even takeovers of local election offices? BENSON: I feel very strongly that the battles that we saw around 2020‚Äôs election ... was just the beginning of what is clearly turning out to be a multi-year, strategic, nationally coordinated, partisan assault on the vote in our country and on our democracy. And we will see another battle in the 2022 elections around that truth and around the security of the vote, around access to the vote. But it‚Äôs also all going to culminate, I believe, in an effort to try again in 2024 what those democracy deniers attempted to do in 2020 but failed. And in 2024, the bad actors, I believe, will be more coordinated, more strategic, better funded and will have the benefit of doing this work for a number of years. I‚Äôm deeply concerned about the future health of our democracy. Democrats Move to Fulfill Biden‚Äôs Election Promise on Healthcare ‚ÄòPublic Option‚Äô Two Congressional Democrats are pushing to create a ‚Äúpublic option‚Äù for healthcare coverage to compete with private health insurance plans, and aim to introduce legislation by the end of the year, NBC News reports. The health insurance public option, a Biden campaign pledge, was ‚Äúbilled as a moderate alternative to rival Bernie Sanders‚Äô plan to scrap private coverage and put all Americans in Medicare‚Äù, per NBC. There will be plenty of opposition, and the bill will be ‚Äúvery tough to pass‚Äù, NBC‚Äôs Sahil Kapur reports. A majority of Americans think discrimination against Asian Americans has increased over the past year, and many are concerned that incidents of violence are up as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, the Associated Press reports. Most Asian Americans feel unsafe in public because of their race at least sometimes. Only 16% of White Americans who responded to the survey described feeling unsafe in public at least sometimes because of their race, compared with 57% of Asian Americans, 63% of Black Americans, and 44% of Hispanic Americans. The nationwide poll of 1,842 adults was conducted between 20 April and 3 May. More details on the survey methodology here. Insurrection math: will enough Republicans support a 6 January commission? Will enough Republican senators break with their party to support the creation of a 9/11-style commission to investigate how a mob of Trump supporters broke into a poorly-defended Capitol building on 6 January, forcing lawmakers of both parties to flee? NBC News‚Äô Sahil Kapur is tracking senators‚Äô statements on the issue, and created a useful emoji infographic: Susan Collins, the Maine Republican who has come out in support of the commission, also has some proposed changes in how it would operate: Democrats fight over bill that would reform the military‚Äôs approach to sexual assault Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a New York Democrat, has made the problem of sexual assault in the military one of her key policy issues. She‚Äôs now fighting against another Democrat, Senator Jack Reed, to get a vote on her bipartisan legislation, which would change military law to take authority for deciding military sexual assault cases out of the control of military commanders. The change has attracted support from key Republicans, including Senator Joni Ernst, who has spoken out about her own experience of sexual assault. But it‚Äôs being blocked by Reed, the Democratic chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Politico reports. More context here from The Hill: In response to rising homicides, the justice department focuses on prevention This is Lois Beckett, picking up our live US politics coverage from Los Angeles. Homicides surged across the United States during the coronavirus pandemic, in what could be the worst single-year increase in killings in decades. While final national data will not be available for months, one expert estimates the country may have seen an estimated 4000 additional murders in 2020, compared with 2019. Biden‚Äôs justice department announced its new violent crime strategy today. Department officials who briefed reporters ahead of the announcement emphasized the importance of non-law enforcement prevention programs, and made clear that US attorneys across the country would not be allowed to measure their success simply in terms of how many people they locked up, rather than whether there was evidence that violence was actually falling. The officials who briefed reporters emphasized principles and rhetoric straight out of the decades of academic research on violence prevention, including the importance of focusing on the relatively tiny number of people and places responsible for the majority of fatal violence. The Guardian investigated the intense concentration of America‚Äôs gun violence problem in 2017, and explored the strategies behind the dramatic decline in murders in California‚Äôs Bay Area in 2019. That‚Äôs it from me today. My west coast colleague, Lois Beckett, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here‚Äôs where the day stands so far: Joe Biden has asked the intelligence community to ‚Äúredouble‚Äù its efforts to study the origins of coronavirus. The president is requesting a follow-up report on the issue within 90 days. The request comes days after the Wall Street Journal broke the news of a previously undisclosed US intelligence report about three Wuhan researchers being hospitalized with coronavirus-like symptoms in November 2019. The report intensified speculation that the virus started spreading as a result of a laboratory accident. A shooting at a railyard in San Jose, California, left eight people dead, in addition to the shooter, who was identified as an employee of the Valley Transportation Authority. Biden has been briefed on the shooting, and vice-President Kamala Harris described it as ‚Äúabsolutely tragic‚Äù. US diplomats sent a letter to the state department complaining that those with ‚ÄúHavana syndrome‚Äù are being denied proper care, according to NBC News. The diplomats are calling for the Biden administration to take the condition more seriously, NBC reported. Senate Republicans will soon propose a counteroffer in the ongoing negotiations over an infrastructure package. The Republican negotiators are expected to propose spending $1tn on an infrastructure bill, which is still far less than the $1.7tn that Biden called for last week, when he issued his own counteroffer. Karine Jean-Pierre made history as the first openly gay person and the second Black woman to ever hold a White House briefing. The principal deputy White House press secretary held her first formal briefing with reporters this afternoon. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. ‚ÄúHi, everybody! Welcome!‚Äù So, with a rustle of papers, began a new chapter in the White House briefing room on Wednesday when Karine Jean-Pierre became the first openly gay person to address reporters on behalf of the US president. She was also the first Black woman to do so since Judy Smith, a deputy press secretary for President George H W Bush ‚Äì and inspiration for Olivia Pope in the TV drama Scandal ‚Äì stood at the podium some 30 years ago. The briefing was widely seen as an audition by Jean-Pierre, who is currently principal deputy press secretary, for the top job of presidential spokesperson. The incumbent, Jen Psaki, who has been briefing almost daily, said recently she intends to leave the post after a year. Did Jean-Pierre pass the audition? Joe Biden will be the ultimate judge of that but it would fair to say that she observed the first rule for press secretaries: do no harm. Her replies were noncommittal, uncontroversial and not likely to generate unwanted headlines. Vice-President Kamala Harris, a former senator of California, described today‚Äôs mass shooting in San Jose as ‚Äúabsolutely tragic‚Äù. Speaking at the beginning of a meeting with members of Congress on investing in broadband infrastructure, Harris noted she has family members who live in San Jose and has worked with the mayor and police department there. ‚ÄúMy prayers and my thoughts are with all of those families affected,‚Äù Harris told reporters. Joe Biden has been briefed on the mass shooting today at a railyard in San Jose, California, the White House said in a statement to the press pool. ‚ÄúThe President has been briefed on the mass shooting and the tragic loss of life in San Jose by his Homeland Security Advisor, Liz Sherwood-Randall. The White House continues to monitor the situation and remains in close contact with local officials to offer any assistance as needed,‚Äù the statement said. Local authorities said eight people were killed in the attack, in addition to the shooter, who was identified as an employee of the Valley Transportation Authority. Multiple other people were injured in the shooting, and a police spokesperson warned the death toll could still rise. US diplomats and other officials experiencing symptoms that appear to be consistent with the unexplained brain injury known as Havana Syndrome have written a letter to the US state department saying those affected are being denied appropriate care. NBC News, which obtained the letter, reports that staffers have claimed that the Biden administration has continued to ‚Äúinvalidate our injuries and experiences,‚Äù and they are calling for the condition to be treated more seriously. Last month, The New York Times reported that there had been more than 130 incidents of Havana syndrome among US diplomats, spies and defence officials, some of them very recently. The Times said three CIA officers had reported serious symptoms since December, following overseas assignments. The Guardian‚Äôs world affairs editor, Julian Borger, reported at the time: In December, the National Academy of Sciences published a report saying that the brain injuries suffered by US government employees in Cuba and China were most likely the result of some form of directed energy. Cheryl Rofer, a former chemist at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, has questioned the study‚Äôs conclusions, and the claim by victims and some experts that some kind of microwave weapon developed by an adversary is responsible for Havana syndrome. ‚ÄòThe evidence for microwave effects of the type categorized as Havana syndrome is exceedingly weak,‚Äô Rofer wrote in Foreign Policy. Republican Senator Tim Scott said Congress must reach a deal on the policing reform bill next month, as bipartisan negotiations over the legislation continue. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs June or bust,‚Äù Scott told a PBS Newshour reporter. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got three weeks in June to get this done.‚Äù Scott is one of three lawmakers, along with Democratic congresswoman Karen Bass and Democratic Senator Cory Booker, who are involved in the negotiations over the bill. Joe Biden had originally said he hoped to sign the bill by the one-year anniversary of the death of George Floyd, the Black man who was murdered by a white Minneapolis police officer last May. But that anniversary came and went yesterday without a final deal on the policing bill. Biden met yesterday with some of Floyd‚Äôs family members, who urged Congress to pass the legislation as quickly as possible. Speaking to reporters this afternoon, deputy White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said policing reform remains a ‚Äútop priority‚Äù for the president. ‚ÄúHe is going to continue to work on this today, tomorrow and every day,‚Äù Jean-Pierre said. President Joe Biden has paid tribute to former Virginia Republican senator John Warner who died on Tuesday aged 94, saying he ‚Äúlived an extraordinary life of service and accomplishment‚Äù. In a statement issued Wednesday, Biden said: ‚ÄúI had the privilege of serving alongside John in the Senate for three decades. The John Warner I knew was guided by two things: his conscience and our Constitution. And, when acting in accordance with both, he neither wavered in his convictions nor was concerned with the consequences.‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúWhen told that if he voted in a way that was not in line with his party‚Äôs position‚Äîas he did numerous times on issues of rational gun policy, women‚Äôs rights, and judicial nominees‚Äîthat ‚Äúpeople would say,‚Äù his favorite rejoinder was, ‚ÄúLet ‚Äòem say it.‚Äù ‚ÄúIndeed, that was his response when, in one of the great honors of my career, he crossed party lines to support me in the 2020 election.‚Äù Biden ended the statement by saying ‚Äúour hearts and prayers are with his family‚Äù. The White House is reportedly finalizing plans for president Joe Biden to meet with Queen Elizabeth II during his first trip abroad next month, according to CNN. ‚ÄúThis face-to-face greeting, during which Biden would be joined by first lady Jill Biden, is expected to take place before the president leaves the United Kingdom following the Group of 7 summit,‚Äù CNN reported, citing an unnamed US official. The official reportedly said the White House and Buckingham Palace were finalizing details on Wednesday, and an announcement was expected in the coming days. The Queen, who is 95 years-old and is the world‚Äôs longest-reigning monarch, has met every US president since Harry Truman, with the exception of Lyndon Johnson. If the meeting goes ahead, Biden would be the 13th American president she has met. Karine Jean-Pierre indicated the Biden administration will also continue to press the World Health Organization to gather information on the origins of coronavirus. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been very clear with the WHO to continue to get to the bottom of this,‚Äù the deputy press secretary said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to continue working with the WHO.‚Äù Jean-Pierre noted Joe Biden brought the US back into the WHO after Donald Trump withdrew from the organization, and she said the president made that decision partly to hold the group accountable when it comes to investigating the origins of coronavirus. The White House press briefing has now concluded. A reporter pressed Karine Jean-Pierre on what has changed recently to make Joe Biden call for a 90-day intelligence community review of the potential origins of coronavirus. The New York Times reporter noted that Jean-Pierre‚Äôs boss, press secretary Jen Psaki, had been emphasizing the World Health Organization‚Äôs investigation (rather than a domestic investigation) as recently as last week. Jean-Pierre insisted nothing has changed in recent days, telling reporters, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt speak about everything under review.‚Äù Biden‚Äôs announcement came days after the Wall Street Journal broke news of a previously undisclosed US intelligence report about three Wuhan researchers being hospitalized with coronavirus-like symptoms in November 2019, intensifying speculation that the virus spread as the result of a lab accident. Asked if the US intelligence community has ruled out the possibility of a deliberate release of coronavirus, Karine Jean-Pierre replied, ‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt ruled out anything yet.‚Äù The deputy White House press secretary repeatedly emphasized that the administration will have more information to offer on the investigation into the origins of coronavirus once the 90-day intelligence community review is completed. Jean-Pierre repeatedly criticized China for not being transparent with its information on the origins of the virus, echoing comments from other senior administration officials and international leaders. Deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked about the White House‚Äôs response to the shooting this morning at a railyard in San Jose, California. ‚ÄúOur hearts go out to the victims and their families,‚Äù Jean-Pierre said. ‚ÄúThere is an ongoing investigation, as we all know. We will continue to stay in close contact with them and offer any assistance as needed.‚Äù San Jose officials have just confirmed that eight people died in the shooting, in addition to the shooter, who reportedly died by suicide after the attack. A police spokesperson warned that the number of victims could change, as multiple other people were injured in the attack. One reporter asked Karine Jean-Pierre to reflect on her history-making appearance at the White House briefing room podium today. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a real honor to just be standing here today. I appreciate the historic nature‚Äù of this moment, the deputy White House press secretary said. But Jean-Pierre emphasized that this administration is not about any one person and is instead focused on the collective efforts to improve American lives. She also promised to be ‚Äútruthful‚Äù and ‚Äútransparent‚Äù while speaking to the press. ‚ÄúClearly, the president believes representation matters, and I appreciate him giving me this opportunity,‚Äù Jean-Pierre said. No surprise here: the first questions at the White House briefing focused on Joe Biden‚Äôs announcement that he is asking the intelligence community to ‚Äúredouble‚Äù efforts to study the origins of coronavirus. Deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre would not say whether the report will be made public when it is completed. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll have more to share after the 90 days,‚Äù Jean-Pierre said, referring to the deadline set by the president for completing the report. Deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre is now holding her first formal briefing with reporters in the White House briefing room. Jean-Pierre‚Äôs appearance at the briefing room podium makes her just the second Black woman to hold a White House briefing, after Judy Smith did so 30 years ago while serving in George HW Bush‚Äôs administration. Jean-Pierre has been mentioned as a potential successor to press secretary Jen Psaki, who has said she only wants to stay in the job for one year. if Jean-Pierre were selected to succeed Psaki, she would be the first Black woman to serve as White House press secretary. Testifying before a Senate appropriations subcommittee today, Dr Anthony Fauci reiterated that he is ‚Äúvery much in favor‚Äù of further investigation into the origins of coronavirus. Fauci, the president‚Äôs chief medical adviser, and some of his colleagues from the National Institutes of Health said they still believed coronavirus most likely came about from human contact with an infected animal. Fauci told Republican Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith, ‚ÄúI feel the likelihood is still high that this is a natural occurrence, but since you cannot know 100% whether it is or is not -- other possibilities exist -- and for that reason, I and my colleagues have been saying that we are very much in favor of a further investigation.‚Äù Here‚Äôs where the day stands so far: Joe Biden has asked the intelligence community to ‚Äúredouble‚Äù its efforts to study the origins of coronavirus. The president is requesting a follow-up report on the issue within 90 days. The request comes days after the Wall Street Journal broke the news of a previously undisclosed US intelligence report about three Wuhan researchers being hospitalized with coronavirus-like symptoms in November 2019. The report intensified speculation that the virus started spreading as a result of a laboratory accident. A shooting at a railyard in San Jose, California, left multiple people dead. Authorities said the shooting resulted in ‚Äúmultiple injuries and multiple fatalities,‚Äù and the shooter is now dead. The victims include Valley Transportation Authority employees. Senate Republicans will soon propose a counteroffer in the ongoing negotiations over an infrastructure package. The Republican negotiators are expected to propose spending $1 trillion on an infrastructure bill, which is still far less than the $1.7 trillion that Biden called for last week, when he issued his own counteroffer. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Joe Biden‚Äôs request to intensify the investigation into the origins of coronavirus comes days after the Wall Street Journal reported on a previously undisclosed US intelligence report about three Wuhan researchers being hospitalized with coronavirus-like symptoms in November 2019. The report intensified speculation that coronavirus may have spread as a result of a laboratory accident in China. The Journal reported: Three researchers from China‚Äôs Wuhan Institute of Virology became sick enough in November 2019 that they sought hospital care, according to a previously undisclosed U.S. intelligence report that could add weight to growing calls for a fuller probe of whether the Covid-19 virus may have escaped from the laboratory. The details of the reporting go beyond a State Department fact sheet, issued during the final days of the Trump administration, which said that several researchers at the lab, a center for the study of coronaviruses and other pathogens, became sick in autumn 2019 ‚Äòwith symptoms consistent with both Covid-19 and common seasonal illness.‚Äô ... Current and former officials familiar with the intelligence about the lab researchers expressed differing views about the strength of the supporting evidence for the assessment. One person said that it was provided by an international partner and was potentially significant but still in need of further investigation and additional corroboration. Another person described the intelligence as stronger. ‚ÄòThe information that we had coming from the various sources was of exquisite quality. It was very precise. What it didn‚Äôt tell you was exactly why they got sick,‚Äô he said, referring to the researchers. Joe Biden has asked the US intelligence community to ‚Äúredouble‚Äù its efforts to study the origins of coronavirus. The president said he received a report earlier this month with the ‚Äúmost up-to-date analysis of the origins of COVID-19,‚Äù and he has asked for additional follow-up within 90 days. Biden noted that the US intelligence community has not yet coalesced around a common theory as to whether coronavirus came about from human contact with an infected animal or from a laboratory accident. ‚ÄúI have now asked the Intelligence Community to redouble their efforts to collect and analyze information that could bring us closer to a definitive conclusion, and to report back to me in 90 days. As part of that report, I have asked for areas of further inquiry that may be required, including specific questions for China,‚Äù Biden said. The president said he has also asked the intelligence community to keep Congress apprised of its work on this matter. ‚ÄúThe United States will also keep working with like-minded partners around the world to press China to participate in a full, transparent, evidence-based international investigation and to provide access to all relevant data and evidence,‚Äù Biden said. Deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre will soon hold her first formal briefing in the White House briefing room. Jean-Pierre is only the second Black woman to lead a briefing in the briefing room, after Judy Smith did so 30 years ago while serving in George HW Bush‚Äôs administration. Symone Sanders, who serves as chief spokesperson for Vice-President Kamala Harris, congratulated Jean-Pierre on the significant moment. ‚ÄúI will be raising my coffee cup during the WH press briefing in celebration of representation, aptitude and brilliance,‚Äù Sanders said on Twitter. ‚ÄúThe ancestors are proud.‚Äù The suspect in the San Jose shooting died by suicide, according to CBS News. It‚Äôs still unclear how many people were killed in the attack, although a sheriff‚Äôs office spokesperson confirmed there were ‚Äúmultiple fatalities‚Äù. Guardian staff and agencies report: The San Jose shooting took place at a light rail facility that is nextdoor to the Santa Clara county sheriff‚Äôs department and across a freeway from the airport. The facility is a transit control center that stores trains and has a maintenance yard. A spokesperson for the Valley Transportation Authority did not immediately respond to multiple requests for comment. A shooting at a railyard in San Jose, California, has left multiple people dead and several others injured, a spokesperson for the Santa Clara County sheriff‚Äôs office said. The spokesperson would not say the exact number of victims, but he confirmed to reporters that there were ‚Äúmultiple injuries and multiple fatalities‚Äù from the shooting. The victims include Valley Transportation Authority employees. The mayor of San Jose, Sam Liccardo, previously said on Twitter that the shooter is now dead and the facility has been evacuated. He said more information would be made available in about 30 minutes. California Governor Gavin Newsom also said in a tweet that he is closely monitoring the situation and remains in contact with local law enforcement officials. Second gentleman Douglas Emhoff will travel tomorrow to Albuquerque, New Mexico, the White House has just announced. According to Politico, the vice-president‚Äôs husband is traveling to the state to campaign for Melanie Stansbury, the Democratic congressional candidate who is running to fill Interior Secretary Deb Haaland‚Äôs seat in the House. Politico reports: The second gentleman will be heading to New Mexico to campaign with Democratic congressional candidate Melanie Stansbury ahead of the special election on Tuesday, according to two sources with knowledge of the planning. An administration official says the event will take place on Thursday. ... This won‚Äôt be the first political event for Emhoff who joined DNC Chair Jaime Harrison in March for the latter‚Äôs first virtual fundraiser. It is, however, his first campaign event since the November election. Emhoff is no stranger to the trail. He was a mainstay of Vice President Kamala Harris‚Äô primary bid and did solo events during the general election after she joined the Biden ticket. Joe Biden endorsed Stansbury in a statement yesterday, saying she has ‚Äúthe grit and determination to deliver real results for all New Mexicans‚Äù. The seat is considered safely Democratic, given that Biden won it by 23 points in November. New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft has denied allegations he and Donald Trump attempted to pay a senator money in order to drop an investigation into a cheating scandal involving the team. According to a report published on Wednesday by ESPN, Trump met with late senator Arlen Specter in 2008 and offered him ‚Äúmoney in Palm Beach‚Äù if he dropped his investigation into the Spygate scandal, in which the Patriots were disciplined by the NFL for filming a rival team‚Äôs coaching signals. Trump had not started his political career at the time and was well-known as the star of reality show The Apprentice. ESPN says Trump was acting on behalf of Kraft, a claim those close to the former president and the team deny. ‚ÄúThis [report] is completely false,‚Äù Jason Miller, a senior adviser to Trump, told ESPN when asked about the story. ‚ÄúWe have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about.‚Äù A spokesman for the Patriots also denied the allegations to ESPN. ‚ÄúMr Kraft is not aware of any involvement of Trump on this topic and he did not have any other engagement with Specter or his staff,‚Äù the spokesman said via email. Specter was senator for Pennsylvania at the time and ran as a Democrat and Republican during his political career. He was also a personal friend of Trump. Trump himself has been on friendly terms with several prominent members of the Patriots including Kraft, head coach Bill Belichick and former quarterback Tom Brady. Both Brady and Belichick have distanced themselves from Trump recently. In January, following the US Capitol invasion, Belichick turned down Trump‚Äôs offer of the presidential medal of freedom. Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer said the flags around the Senate side of the US Capitol will be lowered to half-staff in honor of the late senator John Warner, who died last night at the age of 94. ‚ÄúOn behalf of the Senate, I want to express our condolences to his family and his friends, and our gratitude for amazing service to America throughout his life,‚Äù the Democratic leader said in a floor speech moments ago. Virginia Governor Ralph Northam described the late senator John Warner as ‚Äúthe best of what public service and elected leadership should be‚Äù. ‚ÄúVirginia, and America, have lost a giant,‚Äù the Democratic governor said in a statement. ‚ÄúAs a sailor, a senator, a statesman, and a gentleman, former U.S. Senator John Warner spent his life in public service.‚Äù Northam offered his prayers to Warner‚Äôs family members as they mourn his death at the age of 94. ‚ÄúJohn helped build up his political party and always remained an independent voice. He used that voice in the Senate to forge bipartisan compromise, knowing how and when to reach across the aisle. And he always put Virginia first,‚Äù Northam said. ‚ÄúOur prayers for comfort go out to his wife Jeanne, his three children, grandchildren, scores of friends, and all those who loved him.‚Äù John Warner, the longtime former Republican senator of Virginia who clashed with George W Bush over the Iraq War, has died of heart failure at 94. Reuters reports: Warner died late on Tuesday, with his wife and daughter at his side, his chief of staff, Susan Magill, said in an email to family and friends, according to a Politico report on Wednesday. The Washington Post said he died in Alexandria, Virginia. Warner was an influential voice in Congress on military policy and served in the US Senate for five terms from 1979 to 2009. He was also the sixth husband of the actor Elizabeth Taylor. A former chairman of the Senate armed services committee, Warner openly criticized President George W Bush‚Äôs handling of the Iraq war and called on him in 2007 to begin withdrawing US troops from Iraq. The decision put Warner in the center of a growing debate in Congress over the conflict. Warner spent months trying to develop an approach to US policy in Iraq that was supported by Republicans and Democrats. Lawmakers of both parties responded to the news of Warner‚Äôs death by offering admiring condolence messages to the his family. Current Virginia Senator Mark Warner, who was not related to the late senator, said of him, ‚ÄúJohn Warner was a consummate statesman and a public servant who always put Virginia before politics; who put the nation‚Äôs security before partisanship; who put the country‚Äôs needs above his own.‚Äù When deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre holds her first formal White House briefing this afternoon, she will be only the second Black woman to ever do so, according to a CBS News reporter. Alexandra Villarreal reports on how white male minority rule has overtaken US politics: From county officials and sheriffs to governors and senators, white male minority rule pervades politics in the United States, according to a new report published on Wednesday. White men represent 30% of the population but 62% of officeholders, dominating both chambers of Congress, 42 state legislatures and statewide roles across the nation, the analysis shows. By contrast, women and people of color constitute 51% and 40% of the US population respectively, but just 31% and 13% of officeholders, according to the research by the Reflective Democracy Campaign, shared exclusively with the Guardian. ‚ÄúI think if we saw these numbers in another country, we would say there is something very wrong with that political system,‚Äù said Brenda Choresi Carter, the campaign‚Äôs director. ‚ÄúWe would say, ‚Äòhow could that possibly be a democratic system with that kind of demographic mismatch?‚Äô‚Äù Read Alexandra‚Äôs full report here: Today will also mark an important first at the White House. Principal deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre will be doing her first full briefing from the briefing room podium this afternoon. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Twitter, ‚ÄúToday is a big day in the press office and @WhiteHouse. My partner in truth--@KJP46 is doing her first full briefing from the podium today making history in her own right. But doing her real justice means also recognizing her talent, her brilliance and her wonderful spirit.‚Äù Jean-Pierre has done briefings with reporters aboard Air Force One before, usually as the president flies across the country promoting his American Rescue Plan or American Jobs Plan. But this will be her first official appearance at the briefing room podium. Reporters will be watching Jean-Pierre closely because she has been suggested as a potential successor to Psaki, who has indicated she only wants to serve as press secretary for one year. If Jean-Pierre did get the job, she would be the first Black woman to hold the post. Joe Biden has reportedly signaled to Republican senators working on infrastructure negotiations that he would be willing to accept a $1 trillion counteroffer. CNN reports: Two key GOP negotiators -- Sens. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and Roger Wicker of Mississippi -- both indicated on Tuesday that Biden has signaled openness to that price tag, a reason why they plan to make a counteroffer around that amount on Thursday, even as there are still sharp disagreements on how to pay for the massive proposal. ‚ÄòThe President indicated he would accept that number,‚Äô Wicker told CNN, referring to $1 trillion. The upcoming Senate GOP offer is a sign that negotiations with the White House aren‚Äôt over yet even as talks are teetering on the edge ahead of a Memorial Day deadline. GOP negotiators met Tuesday behind closed doors, telling reporters that they planned to offer a new infrastructure proposal Thursday that will approach $1 trillion in part because they believe the two sides could find agreement there. ‚ÄòHe used that figure with us, yes,‚Äô Capito said when asked if Biden showed a willingness to accept a $1 trillion proposal, adding that the President also suggested a package of investments over an eight-year time frame. ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre responding to what he proposed.‚Äô The White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, would not confirm yesterday whether Biden had signaled he would be comfortable with $1 trillion as the topline number for the infrastructure package. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to read any more specifics of a private conversation,‚Äù Psaki told reporters. ‚ÄúBut I will just reiterate that the proposal put forward last Friday, that we put out transparently to all of you, that brought the price tag down by $550 billion was directed, signed off on by the president of the United States.‚Äù Greetings from Washington, live blog readers. Senate Republicans are expected to propose a counteroffer tomorrow in the ongoing negotiations over an infrastructure package, and their plan is expected to cost around $1 trillion. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to hit a figure very close to what the president said he would accept, and it will end up being the most substantial infrastructure bill ever enacted by the federal government,‚Äù Republican Senator Roger Wicker told reporters yesterday. ‚ÄúAnd if the president gets to make the decision, he will accept it.‚Äù The new offer comes almost a week after Joe Biden proposed a smaller infrastructure bill than he had originally proposed, lowering the overall cost of his plan from $2.25 trillion to $1.7 trillion. Republicans complained that price tag was still too high for them, but Democrats have insisted the plan must include items like massive investments in green energy, which the Republican plans have largely omitted. If Biden does not like Republicans‚Äô latest offer, Democrats could still try to pass an infrastructure bill using reconciliation, thus avoiding a Senate filibuster. But Democrats‚Äô key 50th Senate vote, Joe Manchin, may not be on board for that, so all eyes will be on the Republicans‚Äô as they propose their counteroffer. The blog will have more details on the Republican offer coming up, so stay tuned.","charCount":"37570","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/lois-beckett\">Lois Beckett</a> in Los Angeles (now) and <a href=\"profile/joan-greve\">Joan E Greve</a> (earlier)"},{"headline":"Villarreal beat Manchester United in Europa League final: player ratings","standfirst":"<p>Scott McTominay battled in vain but Ra√∫l Albiol and Pau Torres summed up Villarreal‚Äôs solid resistance</p>","trailText":"Scott McTominay battled in vain but Ra√∫l Albiol and Pau Torres summed up Villarreal‚Äôs solid resistance","byline":"Andy Hunter","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fecbb46dadc4079d7984785a5ac2da4b3b4a9ff5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fecbb46dadc4079d7984785a5ac2da4b3b4a9ff5/0_270_4374_2625/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manchester United‚Äôs Scott McTominay is challenged by Dani Parejo of Villarreal - both midfielders had excellent games in the Europa League final.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Manchester United‚Äôs Scott McTominay is challenged by Dani Parejo of Villarreal - both midfielders had excellent games in the Europa League final.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Boris Streubel/Uefa/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<h2>Manchester United (4-2-3-1)</h2> <p><strong>David de Gea</strong> Beaten by an awkward bounce on goal but had little to do until the until the final, decisive penalty kick. <strong>6</strong></p> <p><strong>Aaron Wan-Bissaka</strong> Strong and sharp in the tackle as always, but more was required creatively in the final third. <strong>6</strong></p> <p><strong>Eric Bailly</strong> Effective one moment, a worry the next.

Given little space, missed a glorious chance and took a knock in extra time. 5 Edinson Cavani Uruguayan‚Äôs sixth goal in five Europa League games this season was reward for a tireless shift. 7 Subs Fred for Greenwood, 100 6; James for Pogba, 116 5; Tuanzebe for Bailly, 116 5; Telles for McTominay, 120 5; Mata for Wan-Bissaka, 120 5 Villarreal (4-4-2) Ger√≥nimo Rulli Commanded his area after a nervous start. Well protected by a deep defence. Erratic distribution but emerged as the hero. 6 Juan Foyth Bloodied and bandaged early on but stifled Rashford. Booked for a dangerous foul on Shaw. 7 Ra√∫l Albiol The 35-year-old captain organised his defence expertly. His experience told on Moreno‚Äôs goal too. 7 Pau Torres Aware of danger and assured on the ball. Made important interceptions but not for Cavani‚Äôs goal. 7 Alfonso Pedraza Struggled against Greenwood‚Äôs pace but stuck close enough to his marker to limit those raids. 6 Yeremi Pino A tireless outlet on the right, and often the only one. Sacrificed his attacking instincts to help Foyth. 6 √âtienne Capoue The former Watford man protected his central defence well. Composed on the ball too. Booked. 7 Daniel Parejo Delivered a superb free-kick for the breakthrough and numerous interceptions in midfield. A big influence. 8 Manu Trigueros Skied an early chance with his wrong foot. Neat in possession but offered little in attack. 6 Gerard Moreno Took his one chance smartly to cap a superb season with his 30th goal. Often isolated by defensive tactics until extra time. 7 Carlos Bacca Aside from an audacious rabona cross, the veteran striker had little opportunity to trouble United‚Äôs defence. 6 Subs Coquelin for Bacca, 60 6; Alcacer for Pino, 78 6; Moi Gomez for Trigueros, 78 6; Alberto Moreno for Pedraza, 88 6; Gaspar for Foyth, 88 5; Raba for Capoue, 120 5","charCount":"2993","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/andyhunter\">Andy Hunter</a>"},{"headline":"Coronavirus Australia live updates: Victoria records 11 new Covid cases and braces for potential lockdown","standfirst":"<p>State government considers tighter restrictions as more than 70 exposure sites listed, including AFL stadiums and bars.

Mark Butler took a guess while a guest on Steve Price‚Äôs livestreamed radio show this morning: I think what they‚Äôre doing, and I don‚Äôt really know, but I think what they‚Äôre doing is they‚Äôre just simply using the number of people who‚Äôve gone through hotel quarantine. So that‚Äôs quite a lot of people coming home from overseas, and then dividing that by the number of leaks. The problem though is it ignores the fact that every single leak is a massive disaster. The whole city of Melbourne is in huge disruption. I see speculation about the possibility of a lockdown being announced this morning. I don‚Äôt know whether that is right but I know that would be enormously distressing. I‚Äôm not from Melbourne but my Dad lives in Melbourne. I‚Äôve got other relatives and very close friends there. I know how triggering that would be for a city that was locked down for 111 days last year. To know that 40% of aged care facilities in Melbourne have not been fully vaccinated and I think, scandalously, 29 have not received even a single dose when they were promised all across the country to be vaccinated fully by Easter. Given what we know happened last year, I think must be very distressing for everyone. For those trying to work out the number of Covid cases linked to this latest outbreak in Victoria, it‚Äôs at 26. One of the 12 cases was mentioned by James Merlino at yesterday‚Äôs press conference. So that makes 11 new cases (the ones we didn‚Äôt know about) but 12 in total. Day four of estimates is getting under way ‚Äì a little bit later in the day we will hear from officials within the finance department who deal with Parliament House staffing issues, so we‚Äôll bring you updates from that. The latest Victoria Health numbers are out: Richard Colbeck was pressed on the 29 Victorian aged care homes who were yet to receive any vaccines (aged care is a federal responsibility) outside the Nine studios: I‚Äôm very comfortable with the rollout of the vaccination across the ‚Äì across the country. About 85% of residents across Australia have taken up the vaccine. And it‚Äôs been a significant logistical effort. There‚Äôs some providers who have put back their vaccine dates so that the residents can get flu vaccinations. We have worked with the providers to schedule them over the last 12 or 13 weeks to get the vaccines. Here is a rundown of the various reports of a lockdown flagged for Victoria. No detail has been given about whether the lockdown will affect the whole state or just greater Melbourne. The Age reports: ‚ÄúA source close to the government, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the confidential decision, said cabinet was set to confirm final details of the lockdown on Thursday morning before announcing the public health measures.‚Äù According to the Age, this lockdown will last at least three days, with the finer details being discussed this morning. The ABC is reporting that the cluster has grown overnight to 25 cases, with reporter Richard Willingham saying the lockdown will last at least five days. This is the problem with government leaks before the official announcement ‚Äì there is confusion about how long the lockdown will last, and which areas it will affect, creating extra anxiety. There has been no announcement of a press conference yet, we‚Äôll keep you posted when we know the details. We can expect the Victorian state government to continue to push for purpose-built quarantine facilities, given the situation that‚Äôs unfolding. Yesterday the deputy premier, James Merlino, urged that more secure quarantine facilities be designed and built, with the outbreak in Victoria originating from a hotel quarantine breach in South Australia: There is a sense of urgency about this. The best time to have had an alternative quarantine facility is 12 months ago and the next best time is now, so we are very keen to finalise those discussions with the commonwealth. There are 29 aged care facilities in Victoria which are yet to receive a single dose of vaccine from the federal government. Aged care minister Richard Colbeck was on the Nine Network this morning explaining why, as Melbourne looks about to enter another lockdown because of a Covid outbreak, sparked from a breach in Adelaide hotel quarantine: They should be done in the next few days. We‚Äôve prioritised those. We‚Äôve been working our way obviously across the country. There‚Äôs about 600 facilities that the commonwealth has responsibility for in Victoria. As you said, 29 of those left to be done. They were programmed to be done. They were programmed to be done this week or next week, so we‚Äôll get those finalised as quickly as we can. We‚Äôre actually going back over other facilities, particularly in those areas of Melbourne where there has been an outbreak. The average vaccination rate across aged care in Australia is about 85%. There‚Äôs some that are lower than that so we‚Äôre going back and offering people a second chance to take up a vaccine if that‚Äôs what they‚Äôd like, given the current circumstances. Scott Morrison has also taken to reminding people how bad Covid could have been in Australia if it weren‚Äôt for the measures put in place (largely pushed by the states). Yesterday he accused the opposition of ‚Äúwhinging‚Äù about the vaccine rollout and said people stopped him on the street to say how happy they were: I know that Australians ‚Äì because they approach me every time when I go out into regional Australia or the suburbs and cities of this country ‚Äì they know here, in this country, they‚Äôre living a life during Covid like few are anywhere else in the world. This country has enjoyed safety from this pandemic and an economic recovery like few, if any, other countries in the world. Those opposite, Mr Speaker, may want to retreat into whinging and complaining and undermining the government, as we fight the virus and they focus on the politics. (Nice order of importance there too, in terms of the geographical indicators he used in that sentence.) Kristina Keneally spoke to ABC News Breakfast about that attitude this morning: Well, if we take that argument from the prime minister at face value ‚Äì well, 17 outbreaks in six months ‚Äì ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve never had it so good, what are you complaining about?‚Äù Let me tell you, the people of Melbourne today who are facing the prospect of another extended lockdown, they would disagree with the prime minister. They would say, ‚ÄúYou got a report, prime minister, some nine months ago from Jane Halton, your handpicked expert, who told you hotel quarantine is not fit-for-purpose.‚Äù Hotels are for tourists, not for quarantine and medical purposes. We rolled it out at the beginning of the pandemic because we needed something quickly. But we now know so much more about this virus, we know it is airborne, we know hotels are not fit-for-purpose for quarantine. Jane Halton gave the prime minister multiple recommendations and he has failed to act on a single one of them. He could be, for example, taking up Victoria‚Äôs offer of the Mickleham facility and expanding that. He could be working with Queensland, with their offer to expand and work with him on a national quarantine system in that state. He could be looking at Bladin Point in the Northern Territory. Yet this is a prime minister who thinks that this is not his problem. He wants to shove everything onto the states ‚Äì everything is someone else‚Äôs responsibility, and nothing is his fault. In a national pandemic, and an international pandemic, that is simply not good enough from our prime minister. Looking to some other news at the moment, a significant judgment has just come out of The Hague: A court in The Hague has ordered Royal Dutch Shell to cut its global carbon emissions by 45% by the end of 2030 compared with 2019 levels, in a landmark case brought by Friends of the Earth and over 17,000 co-plaintiffs. The oil giant‚Äôs sustainability policy was found to be insufficiently ‚Äúconcrete‚Äù by the Dutch court in an unprecedented ruling that will have wide implications for the energy industry and other polluting multinationals. The Anglo-Dutch company was told it had a duty of care and that the level of emission reductions of Shell and its suppliers and buyers should be brought into line with the Paris climate agreement. More than a year on from the start of the pandemic, after hotel quarantine breaches in all states and with no end in sight, you have to wonder why more people aren‚Äôt screaming for purpose-built quarantine facilities. Scott Morrison has taken to saying that hotel quarantine is 99.9% effective. But, as we are seeing from one of those 0.01% of failures, which is happening to Melbourne after a breach in an Adelaide quarantine hotel, the cost on communities is very, very high. Hotel quarantine was set up in a couple of weeks in an answer to new problems. Hotels are not set up as quarantine spaces. They have shared ventilation, for starters. We have learnt more about the virus and more about the impact of airborne particles. This is not something the federal government can continue to shrug off. Meanwhile, back in 1950, John ‚Äúlots of numbers‚Äù Troll has something to say about parents in the workplace: We are expecting the Victorian press conference to be held about 9.30am or so. I‚Äôm so sorry, Melbourne. We will hopefully be hearing from Victorian authorities soon. The Herald Sun has reported the possibility of a five-day lockdown is on the cards, given the number of exposure sites. That also includes Marvel Stadium ‚Äì anyone sitting on level one, between rows five and 28 and level three between aisles six and 29 is considered a tier 2 contact ‚Äì and must get a Covid test and isolate until results come in. (That was Sunday‚Äôs Essendon v North Melbourne game.) You may have heard a lot from Peter Dutton lately about defence spending. Daniel Hurst has taken a look at a small slither of that spend: Australia‚Äôs defence department has revealed it is spending $37m to hire private helicopters as it grapples with low availability of the trouble-plagued Taipan choppers. The move comes as defence officials concede a fault found in one of the helicopters in 2019 ‚Äì when it was on its way to pick up the Australian defence force chief, Angus Campbell ‚Äì could have led to ‚Äúcatastrophic consequences‚Äù if left unfixed. It has prompted the opposition to blast the Howard government-era acquisition of the Multi-Role Helicopters (MRH90), also known as Taipans, as ‚Äúa farce from go to whoa‚Äù. Australia needs to avoid adding to a global ‚Äúrace to the bottom‚Äù over military ambitions in space, amid concerns that the major powers are seeking to dominate space, according to a new report. The Australian defence force is setting up a space division at the Royal Australian Air Force headquarters in Canberra early next year, with the government planning to spend $7bn on space capabilities over the next decade. The government has also launched an Australian Space Agency. Dr Cassandra Steer, a senior lecturer at the Australian National University‚Äôs college of law who specialises in space law, said space was ‚Äúa critical strategic domain for Australia‚Äôs civilian and military interests‚Äù but was ‚Äúincreasingly congested, contested and competitive‚Äù. She said major powers were engaged in ‚Äúa destabilising space arms race‚Äù, with China, Russia and the US rejecting the strategic restraint that had kept space a stable political and military domain. In a policy options paper published by the ANU‚Äôs national security college today, Steer said Australia could act as a ‚Äúmiddle space power‚Äù and encourage responsible behaviour in space. She argued Australian leaders should ‚Äúavoid inadvertently contributing to escalatory rhetoric‚Äù. That meant avoiding descriptions of space as a ‚Äúwarfighting domain‚Äù or a ‚Äúbattlespace‚Äù: Australia needs to be careful that, as it develops sovereign space capabilities, it does not accelerate a global strategic race to the bottom. Rather, Australia should focus on its ability to become an effective diplomatic space power ‚Äì building on our history as a strong contributor to space technologies and arms control norms. The paper calls on the government to invest in space literacy training across the Australian public service and for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to appoint a ‚Äúspace ambassador‚Äù with a dedicated team to influence the space agenda internationally. While you were sleeping, US president Joe Biden ordered an intelligence investigation into the origins of the coronavirus. You can read the Guardian‚Äôs full story here: We start this morning with the news that the list of exposure sites in Victoria has grown to 70. I think we can expect further social distancing measures to be announced today in response to that ‚Äì it‚Äôs a huge list. It includes a NSW western Riverina sporting club in Tooleybuc, which is near the Victorian border. A positive case attended a football match at Cohuna which the Tooleybuc club was at. Anyone who was at the Cohuna recreation reserve on Saturday 22 May between 12pm and 5pm must get a Covid test and isolate until they receive their results.

We came here to win - we‚Äôve worked so hard all season and this was the opportunity to win a trophy, and it didn‚Äôt happen. We have to get rid of the disappointment and then look back at the game to see what we did wrong and where we can improve.</p> <p>‚ÄúThis team will not give up. There‚Äôs no chance that the teams gives up. The manager will not give up, he‚Äôll not allow us to give up. We‚Äôll come next season with a bigger desire. People say a lot about Manchester United: ‚Äòthey‚Äôre going downhill, blah blah blah blah blah‚Äô. For me, the hunger, desire, talent and ability... we have everything to compete at the highest level. We just have to show it to the world and to ourselves, that we belong in the top places. </p> <p>‚ÄúWe need to be winning finals like this. In the league we finished second. Second doesn‚Äôt count for nothing. Villarreal won the Europa League, we finished second. I don‚Äôt want to hear it: ‚ÄòOh, they were so close.‚Äô There‚Äôs one winner and one loser, and today we lost. We have to find out why and make sure next time we don‚Äôt lose.</p> <p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm 100 per cent sure [we have the right characters to win things]. I‚Äôve seen the sacrifices in the dressing-room. I could walk you in there and show you five, six, seven players, and me as well, who‚Äôve been playing with injuries since September. We all stick together and fight for this club. We have to go away now and clear our heads, and next year we come back fresh.</p> <p>‚ÄúWhen Ole came in there was a process, and we as players believe in that. This isn‚Äôt the end of the process. Part of it is having ups and downs, and we‚Äôve had plenty of both. Just because we lost today, I promise the fans we will not give up. There‚Äôs no chance. I promise we are close to success.

That‚Äôs football: sometimes it‚Äôs decided on one kick. We‚Äôve got to taste this feeling and make sure we don‚Äôt get it again. We didn‚Äôt turn up, we didn‚Äôt play as well as we can.

Styles make fights - but so do backstories, and when this match kicks off the score will be Villarreal 0-45 Manchester United. That‚Äôs the number of major trophies won by each side. Villarreal have never been in a major final before, at home or in Europe, and even the newspaper formerly known as the Manchester Guardian appreciates how beautiful it will be if they win tonight. </p> <p>It‚Äôs tempting to think of this game, historically at least, as David v Goliath. If that‚Äôs the case, it comes with a twist. Villarreal are managed by Unai Emery, who has won this competition a record-equalling three times, whereas Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has never been close to a European final before. There are unconfirmed reports that, if Villarreal win tonight, Emery will get to keep the trophy and Uefa will pay tribute by commissioning a replacement in the shape of his face.</p> <p>A Europa League victory is in the eye of the beholder. For Villarreal, this match is the be-all and end-all, a chance of instant immortality. United want it to be the start of something - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOTcJJS2oic\">a gate to the shining uplands, like the FA Cup wins of 1963 and 1990</a> and the League Cup victory in 2006. (Let‚Äôs not dwell on the FA Cup triumphs of 1977 and 2016, which weren‚Äôt so much the gate to the shining uplands as the door to the Jobcentre for Tommy Docherty and Louis van Gaal.)</p> <p>In March, Solskjaer talked negatively, though not unreasonably, about how trophies can be ‚Äúan ego trip‚Äù for managers that can hide a lack of progress. Of far greater importance is the positive ego trip for players; a whiff of glory, and freshly polished silver, can empower and stimulate an emerging team to reach the giddiest of stratospheres. </p> <p>Trouble is, there are two sides to every glory. Tonight, as in all finals except the occasional reality TV stinker, somebody has to lose. Eek.</p> <p><strong>Kick off </strong>9pm in Gdansk and Villarreal, 8pm in Manchester.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-05-26T18:47:11.956Z\">at 7.47pm BST</time></p>  </div>","wordcount":"7730","firstPublicationDate":"2021-05-26T16:30:03Z","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2021-05-26T23:07:49Z","liveBloggingNow":"false","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/p/hhgjc","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/556b109906a52651b1da309dcc9365963185a8d5/0_377_6002_3602/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","isLive":"true","bodyText":"Wait, pssst, come back! Here‚Äôs an impassioned Marcus Rashford talking after the game ‚ÄúThe feeling inside is difficult to explain. We came here to win - we‚Äôve worked so hard all season and this was the opportunity to win a trophy, and it didn‚Äôt happen. We have to get rid of the disappointment and then look back at the game to see what we did wrong and where we can improve. ‚ÄúThis team will not give up. There‚Äôs no chance that the teams gives up. The manager will not give up, he‚Äôll not allow us to give up. We‚Äôll come next season with a bigger desire. People say a lot about Manchester United: ‚Äòthey‚Äôre going downhill, blah blah blah blah blah‚Äô. For me, the hunger, desire, talent and ability... we have everything to compete at the highest level. We just have to show it to the world and to ourselves, that we belong in the top places. ‚ÄúWe need to be winning finals like this. In the league we finished second. Second doesn‚Äôt count for nothing. Villarreal won the Europa League, we finished second. I don‚Äôt want to hear it: ‚ÄòOh, they were so close.‚Äô There‚Äôs one winner and one loser, and today we lost. We have to find out why and make sure next time we don‚Äôt lose. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm 100 per cent sure [we have the right characters to win things]. I‚Äôve seen the sacrifices in the dressing-room. I could walk you in there and show you five, six, seven players, and me as well, who‚Äôve been playing with injuries since September. We all stick together and fight for this club. We have to go away now and clear our heads, and next year we come back fresh. ‚ÄúWhen Ole came in there was a process, and we as players believe in that. This isn‚Äôt the end of the process. Part of it is having ups and downs, and we‚Äôve had plenty of both. Just because we lost today, I promise the fans we will not give up. There‚Äôs no chance. I promise we are close to success. But close isn‚Äôt good enough.‚Äù That‚Äôs it for tonight‚Äôs blog. I‚Äôll leave you with Jamie Jackson‚Äôs match report. Thanks for your company and emails, and congratulations to Villarreal on an historic achievement. 26 May 2021 will forever belong to them, and there‚Äôs nothing Dominic Cummings or anyone else can do about it. Night! Ole Gunnar Solskjaer speaks ‚ÄúThe dressing-room is quiet, disappointed. That‚Äôs football: sometimes it‚Äôs decided on one kick. We‚Äôve got to taste this feeling and make sure we don‚Äôt get it again. We didn‚Äôt turn up, we didn‚Äôt play as well as we can. We started all right; they got the goal with their only shot on target, and we‚Äôre disappointed to concede again on a set piece. We pushed, we pressed, we got the goal, but after that we couldn‚Äôt control the game. ‚ÄúThey made it hard for us. They closed the spaces and defended well. We didn‚Äôt create enough big chances. Now is not the time to discuss what I might have done differently, but when you go home without a trophy you haven‚Äôt done everything right. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre getting closer and closer. We were one kick away tonight, but we‚Äôve got to come back next year and make sure we improve again. The only way to get the fine margins on your side is to work harder and better. ‚Äú[Can you call this season successful] No. [How do you make the next step?] We need to get better, simple as. We had a difficult start with no pre-season. We got closer to the top and we got the final, but you need to win these finals. ‚Äú[Do you have the characters in the dressing-room to win things?] Yes, of course. We missed two big one today with Fred [who wasn‚Äôt fit enough to start] and Harry. We‚Äôre building a strong, competitive squad, and the spirit is really good. They‚Äôre gutted in there. Now isn‚Äôt the time to analyse the whole season.‚Äù ‚ÄúBitterly disappointed but not surprised,‚Äù says Ruth Purdue. ‚ÄúOle is shocking about subs and has been from the start. He talks about momentum but they surrendered all of it. And don‚Äôt get me started on changing players from game to game. That‚Äôs two seasons now they‚Äôve run out of legs - not just this season. I am not blaming anyone for a penalty shootout at 11-10 either.‚Äù I‚Äôm not sure they ran out of legs; they looked much fitter in the second half tonight. The delayed substitutions were fairly hard to understand though, because they got very tired in extra time. But I think that‚Äôs an issue within the game rather than over the whole season. Anyone seen Donny van de Beek? It turns out that Manchester United‚Äôs gate to the shining uplands had a barbed-wire fence behind it. They‚Äôve still had a good season but this is a seriously bitter blow which could - could - stymie them if they don‚Äôt start well in August. Some final defeats come with no regrets. Ten years ago this week, United were hammered by a Barcelona team at their absolute peak. There‚Äôs been a bit of talk about Fergie getting his tactics wrong, but in reality that game was unwinnable. There were regrets against the same team two years earlier, over the suspension of Darren Fletcher, the missed early chances and the concession of such a cheap goal that allowed Barcelona to start the passing carousel. And there will be a lot of regrets tonight - the cheap goal, the delayed substitutions, the lack of intensity for much of the game. They‚Äôve looked a gift trophy in the mouth. There‚Äôs a Villarreal fan, a ruddy-faced fella who looks like he could keep a stiff upper lip at a family funeral, weeping openly as he watches his players, his team, go up to collect the trophy. It‚Äôs a beautiful scene, a deluxe version of Leicester‚Äôs FA Cup celebrations. Mario Gaspar, the club captain, and the team captain Raul Albiol are last in line. They accept their medals, grab the trophy and lift it as high in the air as possible to signal that Villarreal have won the Europa League! The penalties happened so fast, and our system kept freezing, so I didn‚Äôt really have time to describe them. Most were excellent, though a couple (Shaw and another that I‚Äôve forgotten) should have been saved. David de Gea, sad to say, had a stinker. I don‚Äôt mean his miss; that can happen to anyone and he shouldn‚Äôt be in that position anyway. But he barely looked like going the right way on the Villarreal penalties, never mind saving one. In hindsight, Dean Henderson - who has greater presence and arrogance - should have been brought on in the 123rd minute, like Tim Krul at the 2014 World Cup. It‚Äôs easy to say that now. United walk up to collect their losers medals. Bruno Fernandes doesn‚Äôt even look at his, Luke Shaw takes his off straight away, as do most of the other players. ‚ÄúHello Rob,‚Äù says K√°ri Tulinius. ‚ÄúConsidering how much stick Emery got as Arsenal manager, it feels like he‚Äôs due a some positive coverage in the anglophone media. Every Villarreal player knew exactly what to do at all times, even when under sustained pressure, which is always a sign of a good manager.‚Äù Agreed. He‚Äôs clearly an extremely good manager, especially when it comes to punching up. Unai Emery outcoached Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, as much as anything in his use of substitutes. The tactics were also bespoke, with sometimes as many as eight players in a line on the edge of the area, but United asked for trouble by conceding the first goal. They had a really good spell after Edinson Cavani, when it looked like they would overwhelm a tired Villarreal, but the substitutions (and lack thereof) changed the game and United let extra-time pass them by. The margins are so fine. For all the regrets and frustration, United would probably have won had Dean Henderson been in goal for the penalty shoot-out. But it was clear after about 94 minutes that United need fresh legs and fresh minds, ideally Juan Mata or Donny van de Beek. Solskjaer has had an extremely good season, but this was a really bad night. Bruno Fernandes is in tears. He didn‚Äôt have his best game, though Villarreal‚Äôs dense low block made it very hard for him. It was a poor match, and Villarreal - quite rightly - will not give a solitary toss about any of that. They‚Äôve won their first trophy and, while their defensive performance might not meet Danny Blanchflower‚Äôs threshold of glory, it will satisfy most people‚Äôs. And Unai Emery has now won four Europa Leagues. That might be David de Gea‚Äôs last kick for United, which is especially cruel - not to mention weird - for a goalkeeper. The United players look a bit numb, while the Villarreal players are having the most euphoric moments of their professional lives. This is a glorious story for a very likeable club, and there are tears on both sides of the advertising boards as their players salute the fans. Villarreal have won the first trophy in their history! David de Gea placed the penalty to his right, but Rullui went the right way, got hands on it - and this time it didn‚Äôt sneak under him! Rulli saves from de Gea!!!! Another spectacular penalty! It‚Äôs 10-10! Rulli got hands on it but it was too high and too powerful. Another sensational penalty from a defender. Another supremely nonchalant penalty! All 1 penalties have been scored! An awful penalty but it somehow sneaks under Rulli! Caressed into the top corner, a tender Pressman. What a penalty! Dear me, we‚Äôre almost at the goalkeepers. Another nerveless penalty. Which poor bugger is up next for United? I‚Äôll be honest, I was preparing the text for him to miss. That was a cracking penalty. Straight down the middle. Now we‚Äôre into actual sudden death. Boomed into the net, with de Gea moving late. And now Villarreal are at match point. A delightfully cool penalty. It‚Äôs effectively sudden death. A brilliant penalty, crashed into the bottom-right corner. De Gea went the right way but was nowhere near it. Yikes. Rulli got a hand on that as well, but it sneaked into the net. So close! De Gea went the right way and got a hand on it, but it sneaked into the net. Another good penalty; Rulli went the wrong way. de Gea, whose penalty record isn‚Äôt great, again goes the wrong way. Rulli went the right way but it was really well struck. Lovely penalty. He sat de Gea down and slid it in the other corner. Gerard Moreno walks forward Here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go, this is it Villarreal have won the toss and will bat go first That‚Äôs usually a decent advantage. ‚ÄúIt seems a bit late in the season,‚Äù says Gerry Scott, ‚Äúfor United to stop taking the Europa League seriously.‚Äù Arf. And so to penalties. 123 min Villarreal make their sixth change - Capoue off, Dani Raba on. 123 min United make two substitutions with penalties in mind: Juan Mata and Alex Telles come on for Aaron Wan-Bissaka and the admirable Scott McTominay. 120 min Three minutes of added time. Villarreal look much fresher, which few of us saw coming after 90 minutes. 120 min United have Juan Mata ready to come on for penalties, if the ball goes out of play. Donny van de Beek has reportedly been seen in Selfridges on Oxford Street. 119 min Now Luke Shaw is receiving treatment after being accidentally kneed in the face by Coquelin. He‚Äôs had a strong game again, particularly during that second-half spell during which it looked like United would overwhelm Villarreal. 119 min ‚ÄúOh dear,‚Äù says Jim Fulton. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt we break for a nap? Pick up in the morning?‚Äù 119 min Spoiler: it‚Äôs going to penalties. 118 min If United lose on penalties, they will have regrets over this extra-time period, which has completely passed them by. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has been far too passive in my eternally humble opinion. 117 min United now have Rashford left, James right, Fernandes behind Cavani and Mata and van de Beek IN THEIR BLOODY TRACKSUITS. 116 min Two changes for United. Axel Tuanzebe replaces Eric Bailly, who has pulled something I think, and Daniel James is on for Paul Pogba. NO PENALTY! That Gerard Moreno shot hit Fred‚Äôs hand in the area, but he was so close to Moreno and VAR isn‚Äôt interested. 114 min: VAR CHECK FOR A VILLARREAL PENALTY! 114 min Cavani is booked for complaining about that challenge on McTominay. It looked like a standard barge, albeit a snide one off the ball. 113 min Alberto Moreno flattens McTominay off the ball. Play continues and Gerard Moreno has a shot desperately blocked! United are suddenly hanging on a wee bit. 112 min Alberto Moreno plays a really good pass into Alcacer in the area. He is about to shoot when McTominay makes a good - and almost exaggeratedly careful - challenge from the side. I think he‚Äôs been United‚Äôs best player. 111 min Rashford is back on. 111 min A weary Rashford leaves the field limping slightly. 110 min Daniel James is about to come on. Donny van de Beek and Juan Mata are not. 109 min A long angled pass almost falls for Rashford, who gets the wrong side of Albiol but is beaten to the ball by Rulli. Rashford is now down and in need of treatment. 107 min Rulli comes out of his area to beat Cavani to a through ball. One problem for Solskjaer is that the players who he might want to take off, like Rashford and Pogba, are among his penalty takers. But then so is Juan Mata. 106 min Peep peep! Villarreal begin the second period of extra time. Villarreal‚Äôs players get into a huddle before the start of the second period. After a painful second half, they now look the likelier winners. Many of you predicted Villarreal 1-2 Man Utd. But that was supposed to be the score, not the number of shots on target. The first period of extra-time was a non-event for United, who looked tired and a bit timid. Villarreal were the better team and had a couple of half chances. They have made five subs to United‚Äôs one, and it‚Äôs starting to show. 104 min ‚ÄúEvening Rob,‚Äù says Stephen Carr. ‚ÄúAlberto Moreno already running the show here.‚Äù He‚Äôs been comically wired. If it goes to penalties, I hope he takes one. It‚Äôll be a Pressman or a Stam, nothing inbetween. 103 min Parejo‚Äôs corner is headed out and United break. Fernandes launches a dangerous pass towards Rashford, but the last man Capoue comes across to head clear. 101 min This is Villarreal‚Äôs best spell of the match by a distance. Bailly fouls somebody in yellow on the left wing, which allows Parejo to address a dead ball once more. His awkward, deep inswinger is slapped behind for a corner by de Gea. 101 min United do make a change, and it‚Äôs the one they all wanted: Fred replaces Mason Greenwood. That means Pogba moves to the left and Rashford to the right. 100 min: Half chance for Alcacer! Another warning for United. Pogba loses the ball in a dangerous area, and Moreno slips a good pass through to Alcacer in the area. He sweeps a first-time shot over the bar. 100 min United need to make a substitution or three. They suddenly look really tired and have barely had an attack in the first 10 minutes of extra time. 99 min Gomez runs at a backpedalling defence and finds Alberto Moreno on the left of the area. He sprays a shot wide of the near post. That was a chance to make himself a Liverpool legend all over again. 98 min Thanks to Timn de Lisle for pointing out that it was Rashford, not Fernandes, whose volley led to Cavani‚Äôs equaliser. No idea how I mixed them up. 97 min United haven‚Äôt got going since the start of extra-time. McTominay tries to push things forward with another terrific run through midfield, but nothing comes of it. 94 min Plenty of Villarreal possession at the start of extra time. Bailly makes an important interception to stop Coquelin‚Äôs pass putting Moreno through on goal, but Villarreal win it back and Moreno plays a sharp pass into Alcacer in the area. He takes a touch and has a shot that is well blocked by Bailly. 93 min For all United‚Äôs dominance, especially in the second half, they have only had two shots on target in the match. 92 min Fernandes chops away from Coquelin on the left edge of the area and hits a shot that is headed away by the indomitable Albiol. 92 min ‚ÄúHas Rashford played himself out of Southgate‚Äôs first XI?‚Äù says Max Williams. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a tough night for him.‚Äù I‚Äôm not sure he was in it anyway. I think the front three might be Sancho, Kane and Foden. Rashford‚Äôs form has been iffy for a while now, though we should cut him a bit of slack ‚Äì for a few different reasons, it‚Äôs been an exhausting season. 91 min Peep peep! United begin the first period of extra time. Still no substitutions from United, though we‚Äôll surely see Mata and/or van de Beek at some stage. Extra-time it is. The two goals were scored by the two goalscorers: Gerard Moreno in the first half, Edinson Cavani in the second. 90+3 min Alberto Moreno, who looks more than a little pumped up, makes a couple of very strong challenges on Greenwood. And that‚Äôs it! 90+2 min Fernandes fouls Moi Gomez 45 yards from goal, which allows Villarreal to work another training-ground set-piece. It‚Äôs sprayed very deep and picked up by the unmarked Mario Gaspar near the byline. He plays it back to Torres, who sprays over from 15 yards with his left foot. That was half a chance. 90+2 min Though Rashford has had a poor game on the ball, his work rate off it has been beyond reproach. He and Shaw have won the ball back in dangerous areas on a number of occasions. 90+1 min Three minutes of added time, on the 26th May. 90 min ‚ÄúHi Rob,‚Äù says Michael Guggenheim. ‚ÄúIn all MBMs there are always the same people who have a say. Mary Waltz, Charles Antaki, Kari Tulinius. Do these people exist? Do you all just use the same five names for whomever mails in, to make your job easier? Do many more people mail in and you just ignore all the others? Does noone ever mail in, and you just make this all up? Yours, Charles Waltz.‚Äù Definately. 89 min Pogba misses a half chance, heading Shaw‚Äôs loopy cross over the bar from 10 yards. 88 min Villarreal make their fourth and fifth substitutions. Alberto Moreno, Liverpool legend, comes on for Alfonso Pedraza at left-back, and Mario Gaspar replaces Juan Foyth on the other side. Villarreal have made five substitutions to United‚Äôs none, which tells a story. United still look fresh and hungry, especially McTominay, Rashford and Shaw. 86 min McTominay roars through midfield and plays a good pass out to Rashford. He overruns it and is tackled by Foyth, but United snap at Villarreal to win the ball back. 86 min The free-kick is just outside the area on the left wing. Fernandes floats it deep, Lindelof misses an attempted overhead kick, McTominay controls it with his arm and then Rashford shoots miles wide from distance. Tremendously done. 84 min Rashford plays an excellent pass down the line to Shaw, who fizzes a low cross to the near post. Greenwood and Cavani get in each other‚Äôs way, but the referee pulls play back for a poor lunging tackle by Foyth on Shaw. He is booked. 83 min Bailly, who might have been booked early on, gets a yellow card for a foul on Alcacer. 81 min We‚Äôre just seeing a replay of Cavani‚Äôs goal. The most impressive thing was his awareness of offside; the second the ball was headed clear, he sprinted as quickly away from goal as quickly as possible. Most strikers wouldn‚Äôt have bothered, and the goal wouldn‚Äôt have counted. 81 min Rashford cuts inside from the left but then shoots wide of the near post. That was the wrong option. 80 min ‚ÄúYou just can‚Äôt see how this Villarreal side can hurt Manchester United,‚Äù says Robbie Savage, whose contact details will be available for a small fee when David Hindle‚Äôs scenario (78 min) comes to pass. 79 min Rashford nicks the ball off Foyth and tries to stab a pass through to Cavani. Albiol reads it really well and intercepts. He and Pau Torres have been outstanding. Moments later, McTominay - who has had a terrific game - charges into the area on the right and drives a low cross that is missed by Cavani at the near post and put behind by Albiol. Cavani tried to flick a shot behind his standing leg. 78 min ‚ÄúYou have to admit, there is a fair amount of malodorous stuff on a twig in this game,‚Äù says David Hindle. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs the Spanish side, 9-1-0 formation and all, producing it. They‚Äôve obviously learnt how to win these European finals. There‚Äôs a delicious irony in there, somewhere, isn‚Äôt there? Or at least there will be when they get their last-minute winner from a shanked, deflected, shot off the post that rebounds in off the keeper‚Äôs head, after eight goalline clearances, lots of ugly blocks and other awfulness of their own.‚Äù 77 min They‚Äôre making a third change as well: Moi Gomez on, Manu Trigueros off. 77 min Nothing comes of the second corner, so Villarreal make their second substitution: Paco Alcacer replaces the impressive 18-year-old Yeremi Pino. 76 min A corner to Villarreal. Pogba heads clear, but Trigueros‚Äôs long-range follow-up spins behind for another. 74 min ‚ÄúMary Waltz clearly never watched Cavani perform wonders for Napoli when, amongst many other superb goals, he scored a cracker against Man City in a Champions League match,‚Äù says Colum Fordham. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a brilliant striker as I was lucky to witness at the San Paolo, now the Maradona stadium.‚Äù I think everyone knew he was brilliant. But they also knew he was 33, had missed lots of football since turning 30 and was signed a split second before the transfer window made that slamming noise. 73 min United have been so much better in the second half. Villarreal have been hanging on for a while now and are starting to look weary. Mind you, we said the same about Romania against England at the 1998 World Cup. 71 min: Great block from Torres! Shaw turns Capoue smartly on the left edge of the area, then hits an optimistic right-footed shot. It‚Äôs miles off target but flies straight towards Cavani, whose improvised header is blocked by the head of Torries in the six-yard box. I don‚Äôt think Rulli would have saved that. 70 min: RASHFORD MISSES A SITTER! Cavani released Fernandes on the right. He drove a perfect low cross to Rashford, who slid the ball wide from eight yards. It was a terrible miss, an almost nonchalant finish, but I don‚Äôt think it would have counted. I‚Äôm pretty sure Fernandes was just offside in the build up. 68 min ... and it‚Äôs headed away by somebody in yellow. 67 min Capoue, who is a yellow, trips the increasingly influential Fernandes. The free-kick is 25 yards from goal, in line with the left edge of the penalty area... 66 min McTominay‚Äôs shot from 20 yards is blocked by Trigueros. Meanwhile, replays show Fernandes‚Äôs cross in the 64th minute hit Torres‚Äôs elbow, but his arm was by his side and he was trying to move it behind his back. Not even Paddy Crerand would give a penalty for that. 65 min No sign of VAR getting involved in that penalty appeal. United continue to probe - or, as the fans are chanting, ‚Äúattack attack attack‚Äù. The match has been very one-sided in terms of possession, though not chances. 64 min United appeal unsuccessfully for a penalty when Fernandes‚Äôs cross hits Torres somewhere near the arm. His arms were by his side so even if it hit one of them, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a penalty. 64 min It‚Äôs been said before, it‚Äôll be said again: the next goal is huge. 63 min Wan-Bissaka enlivens the United fans in the stadium with a storming challenge on Pedraza. Another WB, Wesley Brown, used to make tackles like that at right-back. 62 min ‚ÄúWhen United signed Cavani I yawned,‚Äù says Mary Waltz. ‚ÄúWas there any pundit who predicted the massive effect on United‚Äôs fortunes when they landed him?‚Äù Not that I recall. I thought it was a desperate, Glazernomic signing. Turns out he‚Äôs still a beautiful, brilliant beast of a centre-forward. 61 min ‚ÄúRob, what is the point of Paul Pogba?‚Äù says Adam Roberts. ‚ÄúAsking for a friend.‚Äù I think he‚Äôs been okay tonight, though I much prefer him on the left in this team. 60 min A change for Villarreal: Francis Coquelin, once of Arsenal, replaces Carlos Bacca. That should mean a switch to 4-5-1. 59 min Robbie Savage, on BT Sport, makes the point that McTominay deserves a lot of credit for the goal, as the corner stemmed from his persistence when it looked like Villarreal had cleared the danger. 57 min United are flying now. Fernandes drives well wide from 20 yards after McTominay fresh-airs a shot on the edge of the area. This is very tight. Cavani really scarpered away from goal after the headed clearance in an attempt to ensure he was onside. And he made it: the goal is given! VAR CHECK FOR OFFSIDE! Shaw‚Äôs corner was headed away to Fernandes Rashford, 25 yards out. His volley took a couple of deflections and fell perfectly for Cavani, who rolled it into the empty net. Rulli had already dived to his right in an attempt to save Fernandes‚Äôs volley, so it was essentially an open goal for Cavani. The big man scores in his first European final! 54 min Shaw‚Äôs free-kick is headed back across goal by Pogba to McTominay. He is challenged but does really well to keep the ball alive and hit a shot on the turn that is deflected over for a corner. From which... 54 min Capoue is booked for pulling back Fernandes. We haven‚Äôt seen a decent replay of the penalty appeal yet, but there were no real appeals or complaints from United. 52 min: VAR CHECK FOR UNITED PENALTY Greenwood goes down in the area after a challenge from Pedraza. It was a high ball, and there was a clash of boots as the ball was kicked. Pedraza must have got to it just before Greenwood; VAR says no penalty. 50 min Wan-Bissaka, one of the few United players able to find any space in the final third, has a decent low cross cleared by Torres at the near post. 48 min Pedraza‚Äôs deflected cross leads to an almighty scramble on the six-yard line before Bailly hacks it clear. Good job he did, because the trouble started when he missed an attempted overhead kick from that Pedraza cross. 47 min ‚ÄúUnai Emery has a face which would suit an evil chuckle, but he never really got the chance for one at Arsenal,‚Äù says Charles Antaki. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure that Arsenal fans wouldn‚Äôt begrudge him one here.‚Äù 46 min Peep peep! The second half is under way, with no changes on either side. ‚ÄúIf it stays 1-0, at what point does Solskjaer bring himself on?‚Äù says Matt Dony, joyously high-fiving everyone in the bar and to hell with Covid guidelines. ‚ÄúAnd, how many other people have made this same joke?‚Äù Some terrific analysis from Rio Ferdinand on BT Sport, who shows that Villarreal‚Äôs goal was straight from the training ground. Moreno delayed his run - he was actually being marked by Shaw at first - and then ran inbetween Lindelof and Bailly, who was distracted by Albiol, to score. Half-time business Villarreal lead through Gerard Moreno‚Äôs 30th goal of the season, an improvised finish after he escaped the dozy Victor Lindelof at a free-kick. United have had most of the possession but Villarreal‚Äôs OBOE defence have been pretty comfortable. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer‚Äôs team have come from behind to win 12 games this season. Once more unto the breach, dear Fred, once more. Yes, yes, I know he‚Äôs not playing, but once more unto the breach, dear McTominay simply isn‚Äôt going to get the job done. Peep peep! 45+1 min Greenwood roasts Pedraza on the right side of the area and hammers a cross towards the near post. It hits Albiol in a very personal space, a very private space, and ricochets into the arms of Rulli. With Cavani behind him, that was vital defending from Albiol. He didn‚Äôt know much about it, though the wince on his face suggests he knows plenty about it now. 45 min Rashford wanders over to the right and slips Pedraza with a lovely piece of skill. Then he slides a low ball into the six-yard box that is cleared by the stretching Torres. The cross wasn‚Äôt great actually - there was nobody in there - but the run was thrilling. 44 min Villarreal have eight players in a line on the edge of the area as United probe for an opening. One Bank of Eight is the new Two Banks of Four. But when they win the ball, Yeremi leads the counter-attack and wins a corner. He‚Äôs been very good. Actually a goalkick was given but it should have been a corner - the cross deflected onto Shaw‚Äôs hand and behind. 42 min United have had 63 per cent of the possession, but it‚Äôs a deceptive statistic. The first half has goine exactly as Unai Emery would have hoped. 41 min ‚ÄúGood to see Juan Foyth doing well,‚Äù says Matt Dony. ‚ÄúI loved watching him when he first came through at Tottenham. He seemed way too skilful and flaky to be a defender, like he should have been a mercurial winger or something. I can‚Äôt imagine truly trusting him in defence, but he was always entertaining.‚Äù He‚Äôs only on loan, so you‚Äôll be able to enjoy him again. 40 min Cavani gets a lucky break off Torres on the left side of the area, but his pass to Rashford is poor and Parejo intercepts. He and Fernandes have been very quiet. 39 min Villarreal are defending on the edge of their area, almost with a back six, and United are struggling to get behind them. If it stays like this, Juan Mata and/or Donny van de Beek will be needed to pick a lock in the second half. 38 min Rashford plays in the underlapping Shaw, whose cross is kneed up in the air by Albiol and claimed by Rulli. Rashford‚Äôs ball was slightly overhit, which gave Shaw a lot to do. 36 min An excellent cross from Wan-Bissaka is headed away with calm authority by Raul Albiol. McTominay then surges into the area but slices his cross over the bar. 35 min ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine,‚Äù says Neil Carter. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not worried, Mary Waltz isn‚Äôt worried, it‚Äôll be fine. RIGHT ROB??!‚Äù If I were you, I‚Äôd be a bit worried. Villarreal are a streetwise lot, not the sort you want to go behind against. 34 min Solskjaer is off his seat, angrily berating Luke Shaw for something or other. Somewhere in the world, Jose Mourinho smiles knowingly. 33 min United‚Äôs tempo is already better. It‚Äôs easy to say this is Solskjaer‚Äôs fault, but the Treble team, the greatest in United‚Äôs history, were the same. Human nature is very strange. 31 min I was just about to type that United looked like a team who needed the usual wake-up call of going 1-0 down. Morning, United! Rise and shine! It stemmed from that Cavani foul. The free-kick was 40 yards from goal in the inside-left channel. Parejo dropped a beautiful ball over the defence, and Moreno got away from Lindelof to force the ball past de Gea on the half-volley. It was rubbish defending from Lindelof, in truth, but the ball from Parejo was terrific and Moreno did well to control his shot on the stretch. In a surprising development, Manchester United have conceded the first goal! 29 min Cavani is spoken to after a late tackle on Parejo. It‚Äôs been a dull, scruffy start to the game. 28 min ‚ÄúSterile Domination,‚Äù says Neil Carter. ‚ÄúGood name for a band?‚Äù They‚Äôre a bit too thrash metal for my taste, although that cover of Back for Good by Take That was surprisingly heart-rending. 27 min Yeremi runs at the backpedalling Lindelof and drives wide from 20 yards. The two teenagers, Yeremi and Greenwood, have been the brighest attackers so far. 27 min Pogba‚Äôs cross is just too long for Fernandes, who leaves one on Rulli. That was completely unnecessary, though Rulli made nothing of it. 25 min ‚ÄúAfter reading today in the Guardian quiz that Rashford has performed the most nutmegs this season, I‚Äôm keeping an extra special eye out for one tonight,‚Äù says Nas Iqbal. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt imagine he‚Äôs topped many other metrics this season but what a stage to get out your party piece!‚Äù I knew they should have picked John O‚ÄôShea. (Also, Rashford did top one other non-football metric.) 24 min Rashford‚Äôs 30-yard shot dips awkwardly in front of Rulli, who holds it confidently. Moments earlier, Greenwood played a superb long pass to find Cavani just inside the area. It was too awkward to volley, even for Cavani, so he tried to push it back jnside to Rashford. Cavani‚Äôs touch was too heavy and the ball run through to the keeper. 23 min United struggle to clear the second corner properly. Eventualluy Bacca stands up a rabona cross towards Torres, who heads over from eight yards. It was a difficult chance as he was running away from goal, but Bacca‚Äôs rabona cross was nice. 21 min Bailly heads behind for another Villarreal corner. McTominay heads it away as far as Yeremi, whose stinging shot from 20 yards hits McTominay (again) and deflects over the bar. 20 min A cross from the right is headed away as far as Shaw, who whistles a cross-shot wide of the far post. Fernandes, six yards out, almost got a touch on it but was beaten for pace. 19 min United are still having most of the ball, though at the moment their predominance falls under ‚Äòsterile domination‚Äô 18 min Foyth is off the field again. United try to take advantage with an attack down their left, but Shaw is well challenged by Moreno. 17 min Foyth‚Äôs nose is bleeding again, though the referee is allowing him to continue. Meanwhile, Raul Albiol leaves one on Cavani and is spoken to by the referee. 16 min Pedraza wins Villarreal‚Äôs first corner. Parejo plays it short and then drives it beyond the far post to Parejo, who volleys high and wide on the stretch. It was a neat corner, though, and Parejo was in a lot of space when he arrived late in the box. 14 min The left-back Pedraza plays a one-two on the halfway line, surges into space and is fouled by his former teammate Bailly. He could have been booked for that. 13 min Foyth, sporting a headband and some cloth stuck up his nose, returns to the field. 12 min The corner is headed away, and that‚Äôs the end of that. 11 min Pogba stabs a majestic outside-of-the-foot pass out to Greenwood, whose cross is put behind by Capoue. 10 min ‚ÄúBruno has been a godsend for United,‚Äù says Mary Waltz. ‚ÄúHe is a great footballer. It is an insult to connect his name to John Travolta in any fashion.If you saw Battlefield Earth you wouldn‚Äôt do this to Bruno.‚Äù Sorry, I should have made it clearer ‚Äì Bruno is Pulp Fiction, United are John Travolta. Battlefield Earth is their 6-0 defeat to Accrington Stanley in the 2024 EFL Cup. 10 min A stretcher has been brought on, though I think it‚Äôs just a precaution. Foyth is on his feet and has a nosebleed, but he doesn‚Äôt look especially groggy. 9 min Foyth slips and falls under Pogba, who accidentally knees him in the head. Pogba immediately waves to the referee to stop play, and Foyth is receiving treatment. 8 min This is a good spell for United, with the last few minutes being played largely in the Villarreal half. 7 min The first shot, in anger or otherwise. Rashford steals the ball on the left wing and lays it back to McTominay, who drags a shot well wide from the edge of the D. 6 min Shaw crosses low to the near post, where Cavani tries to spin away from Raul Albiol. Foyth gets between him and the ball and shepherds it out of play. 5 min Greenwood has made a lively start, regularly coming inside to get involved. 3 min Lots of slow, risk-free passing from both teams in the first few minutes. 2 min Both teams are lining up as expected, 4-2-3-1 for United and 4-4-2 for Villarreal. 1 min Peeeeeeeeeeep peeeeeeeeeeeep! United, in red, kick off from left to right. Both teams are in their home kits. Tense, nervous headache? Don‚Äôt worry, the adrenaline will soon get rid of it. It‚Äôs time for the 2021 Europa League final! Bruno Fernandes, United‚Äôs captain in the absence of Harry Maguire, leads them onto the field. He has done for United what Pulp Fiction did for John Travolta; now it‚Äôs time to pick up some awards. The players are in the tunnel. David de Gea is smiling and joking with some of his Spain teammates, a sight to warm the heart of Roy Keane. In his pre-match interviews, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has implied that Fred would have started if he was fully fit. An alternative interpretation is that Fred‚Äôs injury last week allowed Solskjaer to swerve the difficult decision whether to leave out Paul Pogba, Marcus Rashford or Mason Greenwood. Another Fulham email ‚ÄúNeil Carter says he‚Äôs ‚ÄòCROSSING EVERYTHING!!!‚Äô for a United win,‚Äù begins Jake Shaffer. ‚ÄúThat didn‚Äôt work out too well under Moyes. Honk!‚Äù ‚ÄòAnd it was all yellow...‚Äô Just over twenty minutes to kick off, and Neil Carter is calmness personified ‚ÄúEvening Rob,‚Äù writes Neil. ‚ÄúAttacking line up from Ole. I‚Äôve been asking for this all season. Now I‚Äôm going to look stupid aren‚Äôt I when we get pumped. CROSSING EVERYTHING!!! Cmon you Reds!!!‚Äù ‚ÄúI can identify with the Villarreal fans tonight,‚Äù says Richard Hirst. ‚ÄúEleven years ago I was entering Hamburg‚Äôs stadium with tears in my eyes to watch Fulham (never won anything) in the Europa League final against Atletico Madrid, replete with Aguero, Forlan, De Gea (the very same), Reyes etc. We took it to the last minute of extra time; let‚Äôs hope Villarreal can go one better.‚Äù What, lose on penalties? ‚ÄúHi Rob,‚Äù says Peter Oh. ‚ÄúIf the Villareal youngster scores a pearler to leave United in a jam, you could say that Yeremi spoke in class today.‚Äù You could indeed. And what better way to set the mood than with a song about a teenager who killed himself! The pre-match thoughts of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer ‚ÄúI feel good, looking forward to it. This is the worst time: all the work is done and we‚Äôre just waiting for the boys to go out and express themselves. David [de Gea] did really well in the quarters and semis, and I expect him to be ready for this. Unfortunately Fred has been injured in the week leading up to the game - he trained last night and he‚Äôs okay to be on the bench. He was disappointed not to start, but that‚Äôs the hard bit of being a manager. ‚ÄúWe just have to trust ourselves. This is a reward for all the hard work they‚Äôve done in the last two years. We‚Äôve been getting closer to a final. I want them to play with confidence, play with courage and be the best version of themselves.‚Äù I‚Äôm going to take a short coffee break. See you in a peedie while. I look forward to an English team being sponsored by Heathrow Third Runway next season. Gerard Moreno is the biggest threat to Manchester United. He will almost certainly start for Spain at Euro 2021, and only Lionel Messi scored more goals in La Liga this season. Santi Cazorla, chatting on BT Sport, says he is ‚Äúone of the best players in the world‚Äù. Harry Maguire is among the United substitutes, though I‚Äôm not sure why as he has no chance of playing. Maybe it‚Äôs so that he gets a medal if United win. I‚Äôll level with you: I haven‚Äôt a clue! Villarreal (4-4-2) Rulli; Foyth, Albiol, Torres Pedraza; Yeremi, Capoue, Parejo, Trigueros; Moreno, Bacca. Substitutes: Asenjo, Mario Gaspar, Funes Mori, Raba, Estupinan, Alcacer, Moreno, Coquelin, Pena, Jaume Costa, Moi Gomez, Nino. Manchester United (4-2-3-1) de Gea; Wan-Bissaka, Bailly, Lindelof, Shaw; McTominay, Pogba; Greenwood, Fernandes, Rashford; Cavani. Substitutes: Grant, Henderson, Maguire, Mata, Amad, Fred, James, Alex Telles, Matic, Williams, van de Beek, Tuanzebe. Referee Clement Turpin (France). Yeremy Pino, the thrilling 18-year-old who scored at Real Madrid on Saturday, starts for Villarreal. But there‚Äôs no Samuel Chukwueze, not even on the bench. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has chosen an unusually attacking line-up, with Paul Pogba playing alongside Scott McTominay in the centre of midfield. That‚Äôs a risk with a Maguireless defence, and, since you asked, not the team I‚Äôd have picked. There are no other surprises - David de Gea and Eric Bailly are preferred to Dean Henderson and Axel Tuanzebe. United have played in seven European finals, which is pretty modest for such a giant club. They have won five (1968, 1991, 1999, 2008, 2017) and lost two, both to Pep Guardiola‚Äôs Barcelona (2009, 2011). Anyway, enough of all that guff - the teams are in! Of all the things to love about Villarreal, their kit is right up there. This season‚Äôs isn‚Äôt quite as good as the Aeroport Castello classic, but I‚Äôd still be proud to wheeze my way round a five-a-side pitch in it. And if they win tonight, it will have an enduring cachet. Never happened, Gordon Smith scored. Of United‚Äôs likely starters, the only players with experience of a European final (I think) are David de Gea, Paul Pogba and Marcus Rashford. That‚Äôs fairly surprising given United won this trophy four years ago. A lot has changed since then. Some of the probable subs have also played in European finals, including Juan Mata, Donny van de Beek and Nemanja Matic. Here‚Äôs Paul Doyle‚Äôs Fiver, which includes the best and possibly only Gdansk joke I‚Äôve read. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs funny,‚Äù writes Niall Mullen, though he doesn‚Äôt appear to be laughing. ‚ÄúUntil recently I had no real feelings towards Villarreal but just this morning I got the overwhelming urge to support them. Go figure.‚Äù On today of all days Cliffs Notes: Villarreal This is a really brilliant piece from Sid on what this game means to Villarreal. If they do win, only the most one-eyed United fan will begrudge them. We‚Äôll have a leisurely build up to kick off, including team news at around 6.45pm BST. While United are without Harry Maguire, Villarreal‚Äôs exciting Samuel Chukwueze should be fit for at least a place on the bench. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has a few decisions to make, as discussed here. Previously on... 2005-06 Villarreal 0-0 Man Utd Man Utd 0-0 Villarreal 2008-09 Man Utd 0-0 Villarreal Villarreal 0-0 Man Utd The most notable incident in those four games - on reflection, possibly the only incident of any note - was Wayne Rooney being sent off for sarcasm. It really did happen, as demonstrated in the migraine-inducer at the top of this article. Hello and welcome to live coverage of the Europa League final between Villarreal and Manchester United in Gdansk. Styles make fights - but so do backstories, and when this match kicks off the score will be Villarreal 0-45 Manchester United. That‚Äôs the number of major trophies won by each side. Villarreal have never been in a major final before, at home or in Europe, and even the newspaper formerly known as the Manchester Guardian appreciates how beautiful it will be if they win tonight. It‚Äôs tempting to think of this game, historically at least, as David v Goliath. If that‚Äôs the case, it comes with a twist. Villarreal are managed by Unai Emery, who has won this competition a record-equalling three times, whereas Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has never been close to a European final before. There are unconfirmed reports that, if Villarreal win tonight, Emery will get to keep the trophy and Uefa will pay tribute by commissioning a replacement in the shape of his face. A Europa League victory is in the eye of the beholder. For Villarreal, this match is the be-all and end-all, a chance of instant immortality. United want it to be the start of something - a gate to the shining uplands, like the FA Cup wins of 1963 and 1990 and the League Cup victory in 2006. (Let‚Äôs not dwell on the FA Cup triumphs of 1977 and 2016, which weren‚Äôt so much the gate to the shining uplands as the door to the Jobcentre for Tommy Docherty and Louis van Gaal.) In March, Solskjaer talked negatively, though not unreasonably, about how trophies can be ‚Äúan ego trip‚Äù for managers that can hide a lack of progress. Of far greater importance is the positive ego trip for players; a whiff of glory, and freshly polished silver, can empower and stimulate an emerging team to reach the giddiest of stratospheres. Trouble is, there are two sides to every glory. Tonight, as in all finals except the occasional reality TV stinker, somebody has to lose. Eek. Kick off 9pm in Gdansk and Villarreal, 8pm in Manchester.","charCount":"43092","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/robsmyth\">Rob Smyth</a>"},{"headline":"Zinedine Zidane decides to end his second stint as Real Madrid manager","standfirst":"<ul><li>Frenchman departs at end of difficult season for Spanish club</li><li>Zidane to leave with immediate effect after failing to win title</li></ul>","trailText":"Zinedine Zidane has decided to leave Real Madrid with immediate effect, bringing to an end his second stint as manager","byline":"Fabrizio Romano and Guardian sport","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b06d732e6bb34b64017f450228ca19f80cf94b2c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b06d732e6bb34b64017f450228ca19f80cf94b2c/0_53_2085_1251/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zinedine Zidane during Saturday‚Äôs home game against Villarreal\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zinedine Zidane during Saturday‚Äôs home game against Villarreal, which appears likely to be his final match in charge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pablo Morano/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Zinedine Zidane has decided to leave Real Madrid with immediate effect, bringing to an end his second stint as manager at the Spanish club.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/may/26/european-super-league-real-madrid-barcelona-juventus-uefa-disciplinary-proceedings\">Super League rebel trio hit back after Uefa launch disciplinary proceedings</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Zidane‚Äôs exit follows a disappointing season for the club, who lost out to rivals Atl√©tico Madrid in a title race that went to the final day.

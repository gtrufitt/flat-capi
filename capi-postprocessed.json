She probably calls them sneakers or kicks, but here are Serena’s trainers or crep. Martinez has earned 15 break points in this match, several in this game – he’s taken three – but found Tsitsipas’ ability to conjure winners too much. So this time he opts to charge in, and the pass goes into the net! Well played young man, well played. Tsitsipas leads 5-3 in the third. On Chatrier, Buzarnescu is playing well; she and Serena are 3-3. After seven and a half hours, email! “It’s good to hear some Barry Davies,” says Richard Hirst, “but I think we need to go back a bit further – or are you saving Dan ‘Oh I say!’ Maskell for Wimbledon?” I’m pretty sure I deployed one on Sunday, when Andujar beat Thiem. I hope I didn’t offend anyone. I’m not sure there’s any player I’d rather watch the Tsitsipas these days. He’s a beautiful athlete, but more than that he plays with style, innovation, aggression, fire and risk – it’s a profoundly compelling package. Serena and Buzarnescu are away, each holding their opening service game, while Martinez has taken a break back off Tsitsipas. He’s given a really good account of himself here and does brilliantly to rebound from 0-30 and 30-40 in the next game. But he can’t win the two consecutive points that he needs and eventually the weight of sensational stroke-making tells, Tsitsipas sealing the deal with yet another top-spinning forehand cross-court. He leads 5-3 in the third and will shortly serve for the match. To quote Barry Davies “Ach!”; Martinez has run out of road and Tsitsipas is making him pay, breaking again for 4-1. I guess it’s unlikely that Serena, who’s won just the three French Opens, will win that elusive 24th major here – if it’s any consolation, Your Goatness, it’s eluding me too – but if she’s in nick at Wimbledon, she’ll have a great chance. Martinez is not long for this competition, and the strain is beginning to show. After breaking him for 2-1, Tsitsipas rushes through a consolidation to 15, cemented with an ace down the middle. And, back on Chatrier, Serena and Buzarnescu knock up. Oh, and Pavlyuchenkova parlayed that early break into the first set, but Tomljanovic leads 2-0 in the second. Mackenzie McDonald has taken the first set off Cristian Garin [22] 6-4; we’re on serve in the second. Oh yes! Forced to deuce, Tsitsipas caresses a loopy forehand down the line on advantage to give him 1-1. Martinez is plying pretty much as well as he can, but everything he tries, yerman knows something just that bit better. Next on Chatrier: Serena takes on Buzarnescu. Tsitsipas held to love closing out the first set and he looks set to repeat that in the second, but a fine forehand return puts paid to that plan ... so he bangs an ace down the middle by way of compensation. He leads 6-4 6-4, and though Martinez is playing really well, yerman has another level that he contacts when necessary. Nishikori says it was a good match and he tried to be aggressive in the crucial game. It worked well for him, and he’s so good under pressure. While all that was going on, Tsitsipas’ pressure finally told on Martinez, who’s been broken for 5-4; if he can’t find a response, he’ll be 2-0 down. She faces Azarenka next; make sure you’re by a telly for that one. He only needs one! Nishikori finds a big forehand right when he needs one and Khachanov can’t respond! When he called upon them, his hands didn’t fail him, and with the qualifier Laaksonen next, he’s got a great chance of making the last eight – though Laaksonen played beautifully to beat Bautista Agut. Here we go! Nishokori gets to 0-30 then skids into a backhand that draws Khachanov in so he can be passed. Three match points to the best fie-set player of all-time... She plays Keys or Fernandez next, and assuming the former, that should be an extremely fun ruckus. Khachanov finds a monstrous forehand to save break point then eases through deuce, while Martinez battles to another hold and Fernandez breaks Keys. Nishokori now leads Khachanov 4-3, on serve, while Azarenka is serving for the match against Tauson, Keys is doing likewise against Fernandez, and Pavlyuchenkova is a break up on Tomljanovic. Martinez is living to regret the audacity of breaking Tsitsipas, forced to face three break points in short order. But he saves two, yerman shanking a backhand with down the line open. And what a forehand he finds to abolish the third, forced wide on the run ... and dematerialising a winner into the backhand corner! Shot of the championship so far, reckons Annabel, and this is a really good match – both players are chucking heat. That’s not a good place to be against an artist like Tsitsipas, who glides a lush backhand winner low over the net, on the skid; but again, Martinez saves the break and hangs on for 3-2. Khachanov is taking a medical timeout; I think the issue is a cut in the webbing of his racket hand. Khachanov spirits a backhand down the line for 15-30, then drives another into the net; they end up at deuce and Nishikori plays the next two points really well, securing a crucial hold for 3-2. Almost simultaneously, Tsitsipas serves Martinez a large jar of welcome to the real world, snatching his break back with a lovely return, dash, and flick along the cord. Break point down, Khachanov slams a lekker ace down the middle; that took a lot of moxie, and we’re 2-2 in the fifth. Meanwhile, a forehand down the line is enough for Martinez to break Tsitsipas; he leads 2-0 in the second, having lost the first 6-3. Looking around the courts, Azarenka [15] is 7-5 2-2 against Tauson and Keys [23], who a couple of years ago looked set to take the next step, leads Fernandez 6-1 3-2 (with a break)&gt;. Thanks Luke. As I mentioned earlier, Nishikori has the best five-set record in the history of the game and, having won the fourth, has got to be favourite here – though you’d usually lean towards the player with the bigger serve. We shall see... Nishikori holds his second service game of the fifth set against Khachanov, and it’s 2-1. And it’s time to hand back to Daniel Harris, who will see you through to the conclusion of this match, and the rest of today’s action. Bye! Tsitsipas wins his first set - 6-3 - against Pedro Martinez, on Court Suzanne Lenglen. On Court 13, meanwhile, Marcos Giron and Guido Pella are locked at 5-5 in the first set in their men’s singles encounter. Nishikori, meanwhile, holds serve in the first game of the deciding set against Khachanov. It’s been far from flawless, by both players, but it is certainly absorbing. Fabio Fognini defeats Marton Fucsovics in regulation straight-sets style: 7-6, 6-1, 6-2. Nishikori wins the fourth! Khachanov will be annoyed with that to say the least. A couple of unforced errors allowed his opponent a relatively comfortable break. Nishikori heads for a ‘comfort break’ with the satisfaction of having forced a deciding set. This one is going the distance. Azarenka proves her class by taking that first set 7-5 against Clara Tauson over on Court Simonne Mathieu. Now Nishikori holds after what was a bit of a sloppy game from his opponent. Nishikori hit one particularly short shot, and Khachanov had the court at his mercy, but he appeared to fail to make a decision and ended up patting a forehand harmlessly wide. The Japanese player is 5-4 up, and the Russian needs to hold serve to stay in the fourth set. Azarenka breaks Tauson! She’s 6-5 up now and serving for the set. Keys wins her first set, against Fernandez, by a comfortable margin of 6-1. Now it’s Khachanov’s turn to save his bacon on his own serve. He smashes a big wide serve to make it 4-4, and treats himself to a demonstrative fist-pump. Krajinović is fighting against Isner, and has made it 4-4 in the third. Davidovich Fokina, meanwhile, had gone a break up on Van de Zandschulp in the deciding set in their second-round match. Keys leads Fernandez 5-1, while Azarenka has forced it to deuce in the first set against Tauson, having held serve for 5-5. Nishikori holds on to go 4-3 up! That was a captivating game - if a little error-strewn on Nishikori’s part. Khachanov nearly forced his way through, but the 31-year-old Japanese player showed plenty of bottle to save several break points, and battled to find a way in the end. Can Nishikori force a deciding set? We are about to find out. Madison Keys is 3-1 up on Leylah Annie Fernandez in their second-round encounter. Azarenka is fighting against Tauson, 5-4 down and serving to stay in the first set. Over on Court 14, Fognini has taken the second set 6-1 against Fucsovics, a more one-sided affair after he won the first set on a tie-break. So it’s 2-0 there. Now Khachanov forces deuce with a deep forehand, in our ‘featured game’, then gets a break point, but Nishikori bravely wins it with a serve-volley point. But now Nishikori double faults! Another glimmer of light for Khachanov. But again, Nishikori saves the point and we’re back to deuce. Nishikori forces a break point from deuce, but Khachanov wins the point with a classy forehand down the line. This is a very well-matched encounter to say the least. Khachanov wins the game, and Nishikori will serve at 3-3 in this pesky wind. It’s business time for Stefanos Tsitsipas. A bit of hustle and a booming forehand here and there, and Nishkikori does extremely well to save that break point, and then take the game. He leads 3-2 in the fourth. Davidovich Fokina and Van de Zandschulp are into a fifth set, meanwhile, and Isner is cruising to victory against Krajinović, two sets up and 2-1 up in the third. In the women’s singles, Azarenka is 3-2 down to Tauson in the first set, over on Court Simonne Mathieu. Khachanov and Nishikori are locked at 2-2 and deuce in the fourth ... big point coming up ... and Khachanov takes it for a break point! Thank you Daniel and good afternoon, everyone. You can email me here, if you so desire, during my one-hour stint at the Roland Garros MBM coalface. Righto, I’m off to scran and school run. Luke McLaughlin will coax you through the next hour. Those first-set breakers look like hey were crucial; both Isner and Fognini are ahead in their second sets against Krajinovic and Gucsovics, 5-1 and 3-0 respectively. At 1-1 in set four, Nishikori finds himself facing break point only for the umpire to pause play while the wind blows clay about. Khachanov then sets about things, two punishing backhands enough to see him in front! He’s looking good at 2-1, 2-1. Elsewhere, we’ve got some action at haitch cue, which you can follow with Rob Smyth. Hercog says Garcia is a big challenge, moving well and hitting well, noting she was 0-4 against her. “It’s not the same sport playing without the crowd,” she says (when prompted of course), and winds it up a touch by saying they inspired her to fight back in the first set. She’s never done better than the round of 16 at Roland Garros, and is “really looking forward to the next challenge”, but notes that “everyone has plans”. Next on Lenglen: Tsitsipas [5] v Martinez. If you insist. She’s delighted with that, hollering and bouncing in the face of some partisan home support. She meets Vondrousova next – that should be decent. Khachanov only needs the one go, taking the third set against Nishikori 6-2. I’ve no idea what’ll happen next, though, because neither man has played that well for that long so far. Back on Lenglen, Hercog – with the help of a beautiful lob – earns three more match points, all of them saved by Garcia to the thrill of the crowd. She salutes them, then gets broken again, and Hercog will have her second shy at closing out. Nishikori nets a backhand which gives Khachanov the double break; he’ll have his first go at serving for set three in a minute. Elsewhere, Fognini and Isner won their first-set breakers against Fucsovics and Krajinovic respectively. Now then! On Lenglen, Hercog has just served for the match against Garcia, and though she’s got another break with which to play, she won’t be ecstatic at having served a double on match point. The crowd, on the other hand, are going wild for the local girl, who is now serving at 4-5 in set two. It’s pretty windy at the moment, and it’s also looking a bit dark. I’d not rule out the possibility of rain, but hopefully it won’t bother. We do, though, have a roof on Chatrier, so if it happens we’ll have enough to keep us going. After narrowly avoiding being broken at the start of set three, Khachanov has broken Nishikori and consolidates well enough; what this match needs is for both men to play well at the same time, but at the moment they’re taking it in turns. Khachanov 6-4 2-6 3-1 Nishikori Hercog has nearly done for Garcia, leading 7-5 4-1; elsewhere, Fognini and Fucsovics, and Krajinovic and Isner and playing breakers in set one. What a win that is! Laaksonen had never made round three of a slam and to do so here he had to qualify then save three match points in round one. But he was superb today and Bautista Agut let him play his game, so it’s he who goes on to meet either Khachanov or Nishikori. Laaksonen sends a backhand winner spinning cross-court and Bautista Agut turns with a look of furious resignation; it’s not meant to be like this, but he can’t stop it being like this. Laaksonen really has played beautifully today, going for his shotS and generally being the more unpredictable of the two. Bautista Agut has struggled to get anything going since winning the second set, and two huge winners from Laaksonen take him two points away.... Khachanov has made a miserable start to the third set, disbursing a variety of unforced errors. But on break point, he finds as many large forehands as he needs to force Nishikoi to net, then pounds one to the corner when facing another ... and another. He holds, while, Laaksonen – who’s kept Bautista Agut guessing all match – immediately retrieves his double-break! In a moment, he’ll serve for the match! Hello! Out of nowhere, Bautista Agut breaks to love, Laaksonen driving a forehand long, and this might not be over quite yet. Laaksonen 6-3 2-6 6-3 4-2 Bautista Agut Hercog has just taken the first set against Garcia 7-5, while Bautista Agut has just saved another double-break point. He can’t hold out though, a forehand down the line putting Laaksonen very close to round three; he leads 4-1 and by two sets to one. Facing a break-back point, Laaksonen fids a ludicrous backhand drop, from well back and at shoulder-height, the ball skittering away at quite the angle once it bounces. He’s absolutely loving this, while on Chatrier, Nishikori’s forehand earns him a second break of serve and the second set against Khachanov. Laaksonen is giving Bautista Agut all he can handle here, forcing him through a succession of deuces just to stave off the double break. In the process, he plays one divine forehand cross-court, and if he can sustain this hit streak for just a little bit longer, he’ll be into round three. Khachanov loses concentration, near enough handing Nishikori a break to love. He leads 3-0 in set two, Khachanov having taken the first 6-4. Laaksonen is playing the match of his life here; he arranges another break point, and a loopy forehand to Bautista Agut’s backhand corner allows him to scurry in for the drop! You’d not back against him now! Laaksonen 6-3 2-6 6-3 1-0 Bautista Agut On Lenglen, Hercog – who had a great win against Bertens in round one – is underway against Garcia. It’s currently 3-3. Bautista Agut gets himself a break-back point but Laaksonen confiscates it from him before closing out! He now leads by two sets to one, and a won for him would be a massive shock. Meanwhile, after playing a really good set Laaksonen is facing deuce in the process of serving for it and Delbonnis has beaten Andujar; it’s Fucsovics or Fognini next for him. They’ve just started. Power is beating finesse at the moment, Khachanov holding to 15 to take the first set against Nishikori 6-4. I remember a UFC fighter called Sam Stout whose nickname was “Hands of Stone” even though he didn’t have knockout power, which reminds me of Brad “One Punch” Pickett, so called because he wanted his opponents to think he could take them out with a single shot, although he couldn’t. Nishikori holds for 4-5, so Khachanov will now serve for the first set. Khachanov and his stone hands are playing nicely – he leads Nishikori 4-3 – while Laaksonen is 4-1 in front against Bautista Agut. Talking of things made of stone reminds me of the Stone Roses song, one of very few whose title only appears as its final words. Squeeze’s Up the Junction is another as is U2’s Running to Stand Still. While I was watching the end of that, Khachanov broke Nishikori and leads 3-2, while a zipping forehand, cross-court, on the run, and only just over the net, arranged Laaksonen a break point. Bautista Agut saved it, but couldn’t do likewise with the next – he’s not coping well with the Swiss’ power. What a match that was! Kudermetova served for it at 5-4, but Siniakova hung in there then played a terrific game to get home, consecutive blistering forehands sealing the deal. She meets Zidansek next, and that should be a lot of fun. Ruud is now two sets and a break up against Majchrzak; that one won’t be going much longer. Delbonnis and Andujar are playing a final set and as I type that, Delbonnis – who won the fourth to level the match – breaks at the first time of asking. On 14, Kudermetova was broken serving for the match, so she and Siniakova are 5-5 in the decider. Yeah, time’s up. Bautista Agut is all over Laaksonen now, and an ace gives him the second set 6-2; it’s hard to see how he doesn’t win from here. Back to Khachanov, “Stone hands,” returns Calvin. “He like to stand at the back and club away. Also, Nishikori has the best five-set record of anyone, ever.” That one Murray lost to him at Flushing Meadow in 2016 was the most significant of his missed opportunities, I’d say. Khachanov and Nishikori are away and Calvin Betton, our resident tennis coach, messages to say that the former has huge weapons but the smarter players think they can get to him because he lacks touch and dexterity. Currently, Nishikori is serving at 1-1 while, on Mathieu, Bautista Agut has consolidated his second-set break. Laaksonen 6-3 2-4 Bautista Agut She meets Kasatkina next; I’ll look forward to that one because though Kasatkina is the better player, the form Cirstea is in, it should be a decent tussle. Bautista Agut has woken up, the consistency of his groundstrokes persuading Laaksonen to net; he now leads by a break in set two, though the qualifer leads by one set to love. Kudermetova is nearly there against Siniakova, serving for 5-1 in the decider, while Cirstea is serving for the match against Trevisan. That is a brilliant breaker, but don’t sleep on how well Safiullin played today – he’s only 23 and has a lot to look forward to. Zverev meets Kecmanovic or Djere next; currently, Kecmanovic leads 2-1 but Djere is a break up in set three. A majestic backhand from Zverev steals a point that Safiullin was dominating and although it’s for a hold I wonder if we’ll see it as the key moment in this breaker; shonuff, a netted backhand hands over the mini-break, a delicious topspun backhand doubles it, and at 4-1 it’s nearly curtains. From 0-15 down Zverev powers through a hold – sealed with an ace as Jason Donovan (and Bobby Vinton) once sang. We’ll now have a second breaker of the match. Have a look! Laaksonen has just taken the first set against Bautista Agut, 6-3, so I’m switching to have a closer look at that while we wait for Khachanov and Nishikori (and by the time they start, Zverev and Safiullin might be done). They reckon it’s not as hot now as an hour ago, so the court and balls are playing a bit slower, which is to Zverev’s disadvantage. But he powers through a service-game all the same and it’s now 5-5 there, while on 14, Kudermotova has broken Siniakova and leads 2-1 in the decider, and on 13 Andujar leads Delbonnis 2-1. On Mathieu, Laaksonen – a qualifier - leads Bautista Agut, the number 11 seed, leads 4-3 with a break. Meanwhile, Trevisan has made it one each against Cirstea and it’s now 3-3 in the decider; Kudermetova has done likewise against Siniakova; and Ruud is a set up on Majchrzak. Zverev has broken back and is now asserting his way through a hold, which he concludes with a drive at the bod. It’s now 4-4 in set three. Coming up next on Chatrier, we’ve got Khachanov [23] v Nishikori, which might well be the match of the day. Vondrousova says it was tough to play against the crowd – that seems a reach – but she’s glad the crowd are back and to win her first match on Chatrier. She looks really pleased with herself and well she might – this was a total deconstruction, and she meets Hercog or Garcia next. On Chatrier, Tan hangs in there well to save a match point then hold, but Vondrousova will now serve for the match at 6-1 5-3. My computer crashes, returning in time for me to hear that a loose game from Zverev has handed Safiullin another break. On the one hand, to be put under pressure is no bad thing, but on the other, carelessness of that ilk is one reason he rarely beats players ranked higher. Safiullin has stabilised, opening set three with a pair of holds; he leads 2-1. Elsewhere, Bautista Agut [11] and Laaksonen are just away on Mathieu, while on seven, Ruud [15] is a break up against Majchrzak. On 14, Kudermetova has taken Siniakova’s break back – the latter now leads 7-6 4-3 – and on 13, Andujar has done likewise to Delbonnis, so they’re one set all and on serve. Tan has nothing for Vondrousova, who’s playing better shots but also reading her. She leads 6-1 3-0. Yup, there we go. Zverev rushes through a love hold to make it five games in a row, and he’ll feel that he’s broken the back of this match now, two sets in front. Zverev 7-6(4) 6-3 Safiullin Zverev gets 0-30 and eventually finds himself with a break point thanks to two sizeable forehands; Safiullin saves it, but another crushing blow earns him a second ... but forced wide, he unloads the suitcase at one down the line that’s plenty wide. No matter, he racks a third and this time the forehand does the trick, forcing yerman wide, and he nets. Zverev 7-6(4) 5-3 Safiullin Delbonnis has got himself going, taking the second set against Andujar 6-1, then opening a 2-0 lead in the third. Vondrousova has Tan on strings, and Tan is finding it hard, flapping a backhand volley into the net and ceding the first set in the process, 6-1. Zverev knows that ultimately, he’s got too much for Safiullin, and two big forehands convert the second of two break points. They’re 3-3 in set two now. With the end of the Kasatkina match I’ve switched to Vondrousova, and she’s all over Tan, 5-1 up. She’s looking very nifty indeed and will fancy herself to go deep now she’s got the number six seed’s path. Next for her is Siniakova or Kudermetova; currently, the former leads by a set and a break. That’s a fine performance from the Russian, which she ends with the exclamation mark of an ace. I really enjoyed watching her today – she varied spin and pace beautifully, and meets Cirstea or Trevisan next. Currently, Cirstea leads by one set to love but is a break down. Meantime, Safiullin consolidates well, and given how he’s served today, he’ll fancy himself to hold it down. Zverev 7-6(4) 1-3 Safiullin Bencic fights through a hold, so Kasatkina will now serve for the match at 5-2. There were signs in that last game that Bencic was finding some range – she delivered two colossal forehands – but she’ll need to find the consistency that’s eluded her thus far. Zverev sends down an eighth double, hammers his racket into the court – that’ll learn it – and at 1-1, Safiullin has a break point ... which he converts when Zverev dumps a forehand! He looks extremely displeased on his way to sit down. Bencic forces Kasatkina to deuce, but Kasatkina is grooved and consolidates for 5-1. Meanwhile, Siniakova has taken her breaker against Kudermetova 9-7, while Vondrousova is now a break up on Tan at 2-1. You’ve got to laugh. Bencic saves three double-break points, then facing a fourth, Siniakova’s backhand clips the net cord, leaps over her racket and drops in. At 4-1 in the second set, this looks very close to over. We’re away on Chatrier now, Tan taking the first game against Vondrousova – who played really well to come back and beat Kanepi in round one. Zverev cedes one of his mini-breaks via careless forehand, but a booming ace out wide preserves the other and secures the set. Zverev 7-6(4) Safiullin This is excellent from Zverev, his serve firing and a precise overhead giving him 5-2. Surely he’ll close out this time? Have a look! Two doubles, some poor shot-selection, and Safiullin breaks Zverev! Or, in other words, I am a idiot. They’ll now play a breaker, and they way the Russian has served so far, it’s no gimme. Kecmanovic, who played so well in beating Dan Evans on Monday, has taken the first set against Djere; Andujar served out for 6-4 against Delbonis; Cirstea broke to do likewise against Trevias; and Siniakova and Kudermetova have gone to a breaker. Temper temper; do people still say that? Kasatkina puts Bencic under more pressure, hitting to her forehand at 15-30 and inciting the error; Bencic duly introduces racket to clay. She then saves the first break point, but a tame backhand into the top of the net puts her in all sorts. Kasatkina 6-2 2-1 Bencic Zverev turns it up, a succession of bousting groundstrokes, mainly down the middle, turning 15-30 into 15-40. Safiullin has served really well so far, but two humungous forehands from Zverev, inside-out onto the sideline, then cross-court to the corner, earn him the break. Hell now serve for the set at 6-5, and this looks a lot like class telling. We’re at the various business ends now. On Lenglen, Zverev is serving at 4-5 ... and it’s now 5-5; Cirstea, conqueror of Konta, leads Trevisan 5-4, on serve; Andujar, triumphant over Thiem, leads Delbonis 5-4 with a break; and Siniakova has broken Kudermetova back so they’re now at 4-5. On seven, Brengle fought her way back against Zidansek, only to be broken once she’d got level, losing the set 6-4 in the process. Down 2-5, Bencic improves a little with the new balls, fighting her way to deuce. But Kasatkina serves out to take the first set 6-2, and the number 10 seed has a pack of graft to get done. In commentary, they say that someone – Yevgeny Kafelnikov I think – reckons that of all the women on the tour, Kasatkina has realised least of her potential, which is to say she’s very good. And Bencic is feeling it, broken again – this time to love. Kasatkina leads 5-2 and is serving for the set. I said earlier that Zverev looked comfy out there; behold his rig. He’s also just deployed the monster-serve to save a break point, quickly closing out thereafter. Out on court seven, Tamara Zidansek – who played brilliantly in outlasting Bianca Andreescu, the number six seed, in round one – has carried on her good form. She leads Madison Brengle 5-1, while on 14, Kudermetova – seeded 29 – is 4-1 up on Siniakova. Annabel Croft reckons it’ll be Tsitsipas who makes the final from the bottom half of the draw which also features Zverev; that seems fair enough to me, and I’m sure he’s chuffed that Djokovic and Nadal are in the top. They’ll likely meet in the semis, and what an epic that could be. Anyway, we’re getting ahead of waselves; currently, Safiullin is playing nicely and leads 3-2 on serve. Yep, Kasatkina is a player, and she puts Bencic’s serve under pressure with a booming backhand down the line that earns break point ... which she then converts thanks to a double. Kasatkina 2-1 Bencic It’s only 1-1, but Zverev looks really comfy out there. Thing is, we know he’s a reliable eliminator of inferior opponents, problem is he rarely beats those ranked higher. I’m also watching Bencic v Kasatkina. Bencic, the number 10 seed, had a decent win against Podoroska in round one, but Kasatkina is a player and has reached the last eight if this competition before. She does really well to survive a break point in her first service game; it’s now 1-1. Zverev had a tricky opening encounter, forced to come from two sets down to beat Oscar Otte. But he did so in grand style, taking the three that he won 2, 2 and 0; I didn’t see that match, but it looks a lot like he took time to settle, then imposed himself as you’d expect. Sascha Zverev, then. Will he ever win a major? Er, if I’m going to answer my own question I’d say that the answer is no because there’ll always be someone better, but his win at the Madrid Open, featuring wins over Thiem and Nadal, hinted at a better tomorrow. I’d be surprised if he sorted things this time, but as long as he keeps improving there’s always a chance.

They come over for two or three Tests, are unintentionally patronised whenever they win or lose, and then leave before the main event. This year, they are more like the complimentary bar snack you receive when your table is late. Their two-Test series against England isn’t even on the menu, also known in some cultures as <a href=\"https://www.icc-cricket.com/media-releases/742353\">the Future Tours Programme</a>; nor is it part of the next World Test Championship. And though this is 3rd v 2nd in the Test rankings, it is seen by most as a glorified warm-up for more important matches against the No1 side, India. New Zealand play them in the World Test Championship final later this month; England’s five-Test series kicks off in August.</p> <p>Test cricket may not yet have a second division, but it has multiple tiers. For a variety of reasons – the schedule, the FTP, the WTC, the IPL, the OCG – some games are bigger than others. England’s five Test series in 2021 could probably be split into three levels.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Tier 1</strong> Australia (A)</li> <li><strong>Tier 2</strong> India (A), India (H)</li> <li><strong>Tier 3</strong> Sri Lanka (A), New Zealand (H)</li> </ul> <p>There is a lot of sincere admiration for world cricket’s great overachievers (see, I’ve done it! I’ve patronised them without realising!) within English cricket. But there’s also a subconscious voice that will forever say, ‘<a href=\"https://talksport.com/football/415659/former-manchester-united-manager-sir-alex-fergusons-pre-match-team-talk-for-spurs-at-old-trafford-lads-its-tottenham/\">Lads, it’s New Zealand</a>’. On the face of it, this is another example of England telling New Zealand how great they are while simultaneously belitting them. But as Grady Tripp would say, it’s a little more <em>com</em>plicated than that. New Zealand will be back next summer for a more ostensibly meaningful series, albeit still as the warm-up act. These two Tests, added to the schedule at the last minute, are essentially a goodwill gesture to broadcasters.</p> <p>Money is the main motivation, there’s no point saying otherwise, but there is a bit more to it than that. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/may/26/england-second-test-against-new-zealand-to-have-18000-fans-edgbaston-cricket\">With the return of crowds at Lord’s and Edgbaston</a>, this series feels like a modern take on <a href=\"https://wisden.com/stories/how-the-1945-victory-tests-rekindled-crickets-competitive-spark\">the Victory Tests of 1945</a>. Let’s hope somebody catches the mood and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2004/oct/12/cricket\">plays like Keith Miller did then</a>. </p> <p>There are a few contenders, from Joe Root to the exciting debutant Devon Conway (<a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/player/devon-conway-379140\">check out these numbers</a>). For all the talk of England’s rotation, the standard of the cricket, especially the fast bowling, will be high. And this is not, as some have suggested, as England A team. They are missing only Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler and Jofra Archer from their best XI, if such a thing exists anymore, and Stokes and Archer are injured anyway. </p> <p>New Zealand are without Trent Boult because of his post-IPL isolation, yet they still have a brainy, brawny seam attack* of Tim Southee, Neil Wagner and the fascinating Kyle Jamieson. As bar snacks go, this is definitely more Hawksmoor than Jefferson Davis Wetherspoons.</p> <p><em>* Is that patronising as well?

Conway drives Root neatly, cripsly, through the covers to bring up the 100 partnership in 205 balls. 71st over: New Zealand 210-3 (Conway 117, Nicholls 30) It’s Anderson and it’s attritional, but New Zealand have the upper hand. “Just tuning in and seeing the over rate - 10 overs behind at drinks? Pretty poor in these conditions to be this far behind,” says Paul Bowman. What are the penalties this series for slow play given there are no WTC points at stake?” Well they’ll be punished themselves by not getting a big burst with the second new ball this evening. Might be time to give Dan Lawrence a quick burst too, even if only to ring the changes. 70th over: New Zealand 209-3 (Conway 117, Nicholls 29) Root wheels through his ninth over and.. to the third ball after drinks.... Bracey excitedly races round for a stumping. The umpire calls for a review and - ooof - it’s close, and slick glove work, but Nicholls just got an outstretched toecap back over the line. Andrew Benton writes: “I’ve just returned from having Covid jab number 2 to see the batters having something of a field day, which is odd since it’s England in the field. On my walk back, I found a history of the secondary school I went to in a charity shop - no famous cricketers, but one famous actor. I’m wondering which schools have nurtured the most England or county players.” Eton is usually the answer to this sort of question. Or the school of hard-knocks (the mines). 69th over: New Zealand 208-3 (Conway 117, Nicholls 28) Wondering if Root might come to tire of his vice-captain Stuart Broad and his constant helpful suggestions. Anyway, Anderson is persuaded to take on the task of bowling with an ageing orb and immediately delivers a maiden. Drinks and one last haul. 68th over: New Zealand 208-3 (Conway 117, Nicholls 28) Wood labours through another, but it feels time to give him a rest. From the New Zealand dressing-room balcony, Kane Williamson and Tom Latham chew the fat with a Fat Freddy’s Drop vibe. 67th over: New Zealand 206-3 (Conway 116, Nicholls 27) Nicholls goes down onto one knee and, with a touch of pin-stripe, sweeps Root for four. “This heat business works the other way too, says John Starbuck. “I well remember being in Florence one March and, because it was warm, walking around with only a T-shirt on my top half. When we got to the street market I heard plenty of remarks about how I needed a proper jacket, this from people bundled up in anoraks.” So anoraks go to Florence in March and to Headingley in April? 66th over: New Zealand 200-3 (Conway 117, Nicholls 22) This a game of patience now. Wood must be near the end of this spell, but charges in regardless. Nicholls merrily plays it out as the floodlights are switched on at a Lord’s where the clouds have drawn over. 65th over: New Zealand 198-3 (Conway 115, Nicholls 20) Root zips through a tidy but not over-threatening over. The New Zealand batters pause for refreshment. “I remember going to a Lord’s test match way back when and, along with the rest of the crowd, getting excited when Ian Botham came out to bat,” writes Steve Colwill. “Dot ball, sumptuous cover drive for four, dot ball, caught behind. He left the wicket to a near dead silence.” The deadly power of the silent crowd. 64th over: New Zealand 198-3 (Conway 115, Nicholls 20) A hard-working maiden from Wood. Mark sneaks an email into the OBO post bage. “Really enjoying sneaking peeks at the obo while ‘working’... “Seeing the picture of England players gathering around Robinson celebrating a wicket, I note the height and build of Zak Crawley; has anyone suggested looking at his bowling in the nets? Wikipedia says he bowls off-break, but with his height he might get batsmen with his bounce more than turn if he pushes it through?” You’re right, he’s got the stature but, according to Cricinfo, he’s bowled 57 overs in first-class cricket but taken not a wicket. 63rd over: New Zealand 198-3 (Conway 115, Nicholls 20) The bottle spins and stops at Joe Root. Conway sweeps him airily, but picks up three. “Afternoon, Tanya.” Hello, Phil Sawyer! “In unexpected news, I have ice cream envy. In my misbegotten youth I was Mr Whippy on the pier in St Annes-on-the-Sea. I never got to work with dry ice, though. Kim Thonger has lifted the lid on an impossibly rock star slant on the frozen iced product, complete with a crowd pleasing finale. All I ever got was angry tourists exclaiming ‘’Ow much?!’.” But did you offer lemon tops? That was a new experience for me the first time I went to Whitby. 62nd over: New Zealand 194-3 (Conway 112, Nicholls 19) Conway moves into three figures with some flair, top-edging Wood for four over Bracey’s head before pulling him to the deep square boundary with a walnut-oiled roll of the wrists. 61st over: New Zealand 185-3 (Conway 103, Nicholls 19) A super innings by Conway, he looks classy and nerveless. He’s the sixth player to make a debut century at Lord’s: after Andrew Strauss, Sourav Ganguly, Matt Prior and three others who I didn’t catch. With a one-legged flick off Robinson, Conway sends the ball to the boundary and that’s the hundred! Well played! He removes his helmet and allows himself a modest twitch of the lip corners as on the balcony his teammates stand and applaud. 60th over: New Zealand 176-3 (Conway 98, Nicholls 15) Root whistles for Wood in an attempt to unsettle Conway. Conway pulls flamboyantly, a heart in mouth moment for the spectator, but he know what he’s doing and the ball skittles away safely for one. An exchange of singles and he retains the strike on 98. 59th over: New Zealand 173-3 (Conway 96, Nicholls 14) A glut of runs all of a sudden, as Conway opens the face and runs Robinson down to third man for four. He plucks the final ball into the off side for a single and keeps the strike. Four needed for that juicy hundred on debut. “Here’s what I don’t understand abut low over rates.” types Peter Salmon loudly. “They have been part of our cricketing lives for years, during which time lots of players who participated in keeping them low have become commentators. And yet they are always just as baffled and angry. What I would really like one day is a retired player to say ‘Yes, we kept them low for reason x, y or z’ and we don’t care about the spectators. Because there are obviously are reasons, and the players obviously don’t care.” Peter, Peter. I don’t know what the answer is but I suspect the players just don’t think about unless they are hit hard in the pocket or the scoreboard. In the same way that you amble down the street daydreaming until someone calls you and asks when you’ll be HOME. 58th over: New Zealand 166-3 (Conway 89, Nicholls 14) Conway flicks Anderson through mid-wicket and the hands of Crawley for four. A similar shot goes for three. Advantage New Zealand in the first half hour of this evening session. 57th over: New Zealand 158-3 (Conway 81, Nicholls 12) Root installs a leg-slip and immediately the ball flies between him and Bracey as Conway tissues an edge which flies for four. The admirable Robinson, owner of a low-key villain’s beard , plods back phlegmatically. Richard O’Brien weighs in on the heat. “From a long term expat resident in Thailand. Remember “When it hits 20 degrees, Westerners reach for the shorts and sunglasses, the Thais reach for a jumper....” 56th over: New Zealand 152-3 (Conway 77, Nicholls 12) The attrition continues. 55th over: New Zealand 152-3 (Conway 77, Nicholls 12) Bracey looks neat behind the stumps, unobtrusive too. A smaller keeper than Buttler or Bairstow, more in the mould of a Russell. He could fold up into a teacup. Unlike Robinson, who muscles through another over, New Zealand watchful. An emails wings in from Anthony Bradley. “The first test match I ever attended was Boycott’s hundredth hundred match where the applause was tumultuous and extended. The biggest cheer of the day was actually for Mike Brealey’s three ball duck!” Oh, the empathetic Headingley crowd. 54th over: New Zealand 151-3 (Conway 77, Nicholls 11) Anderson, yellow-soled cricket boots kicking up behind him, chasing his own shadow, varies his length. Henry Nicholls calls a crazy single, if Wood had hit from mid-on he would have been trotting off with a flea in his ear. Conway settles things with four off the last two balls. 53rd over: New Zealand 146-3 (Conway 73, Nicholls 10) Robinson takes the post-tea ball and sends down five on the money. A sixth is clipped down to deep square for a couple by Conway. “There have been many comments about the heat on the OBO today,” sniffs Phil Keegan. “Well, just to put things in perspective, I am following from Hanoi where I have lived for a few years. The temperature the last few days has rarely dipped below 38 degrees, and the stifling humidity gives it a feels like factor of around 10 degrees more than that. I can’t walk my dog during the day as we would both likely keel over and die. Even my Vietnamese sweetheart is struggling with the weather. That’s heat folks.” Ah Phil, you’ve forgotten the weather wimpishness of the average Brit, blessed as we are by the modifying gulf stream. Personally, I melt once the mercury goes over 24 degrees. And according to my phone, it is 26 DEGREES in London right now. 52nd over: New Zealand 144-3 (Conway 71, Nicholls 10) Graham Thorpe walks round the boundary and has a long chat with Ollie Pope. Who know what wisdom he’s imparting. Broad throws himself through another probing over, just the one run from it when Conway manages to get hold of a short ball. That’s it, session complete! A very middle-session middle session: 59 runs and two wickets from it - the over rate an eyebrow-kinking 13.1. Hard work for both sides, who will run away after tea? Will Conway make a century on debut? Will Robinson run through the middle-order as he’s done to so many county sides? Come back in twenty minutes to find out. 51st over: New Zealand 142-3 (Conway 70, Nicholls 10) The penultimate over before tea, and Conway and Nicholls defend stoutly. No thought of whacking the part-time spinner dancing in their heads - perhaps Root’s pre-match kidology has foxed them. A couple of lbw shouts, but neither troubled the umpires. 50th over: New Zealand 142-3 (Conway 69, Nicholls 10) Broad, the pinkness of his face dulled by a sheen of suncream, has his hand on his hips at the end of his over. He accepts his floppy hat with a grimace of tiredness. A hundred percent pure effort topped off with a beauty last ball which nipped past Nicholls defending bat. “Hello.” Hello Tom van der Gucht ! “I seem to remember Aftab Habib was one of my go-to players on Michael Vaughan’s 2002 Cricket Manager. I had a technique of loading my team with not-quite International quality batsmen and all-rounder / dibbley-dobbley bowlers then dominating the County scene until the game crashed around 2019. Its gameplay reminded me of C64’s Rockstar Ate My Hamster in that it had a timeless quality, went in for eons without anything really happening, was remarkably repetitive and eventually just petered out into nothingness. In a strange way, my own real.life has begun paralleling this trajectory too.” 49th over: New Zealand 142-3 (Conway 69, Nicholls 10) Conway on-drives, deliciously, un-troubled by a gentle-looking Root off-break and it hurtles over the Lord’s green for four. Four more singles pinged through for an expensive over. 48th over: New Zealand 134-3 (Conway 63, Nicholls 8) Broad replaces Wood and is on the money immediately. He’s been bowling so well for Notts this season, and has just slipped back into that grove. In the crowd, a man in a strawberry-stripe blazer slurps a delicious looking glass of red. “Just back from a visit to Collyweston community shop to secure a supply of ice creams to get us through the pre and post tea sessions in the searing heat here in The Notswolds,” writes Kim Thonger. “Reminded me of selling ice creams at Somerset CCC festivals at Clarence Park, Weston-super-Mare in the late 60s/early 70s. At close of play the remaining dry ice, used to keep the ice creams solid in the wooden containers from which they were sold, was tipped into the nearest dustbin and the lid was replaced. Then we small boys would gather round to cheer when the lid was subsequently blown off by the dry ice. This was the nearest I ever got to a Chemistry O Level. The nicest thing was that the players often joined the dustbin audience and signed autographs while we all waited for the explosion. I doubt that anyone ever captured such antics on camera but if they did could they please share?” A niche request, but the OBO doesn’t usually let us down. 47th over: New Zealand 133-3 (Conway 62, Nicholls 8) Root’s overs are giving the other bowlers a chance to rest on a suncream hot day. They’ve not really had much of a time to acclimatise to these 20 degree pleasures after the frostiest April and the wettest May on record. Just a single to Conway who sees out five balls then knocks the sixth into the leg side for a single. 46th over: New Zealand 132-3 (Conway 61, Nicholls 8) A hardworking maiden from Wood, someone give him a rubdown with a damp towel or whatever it is they do to thoroughbreds after a race. “Re Richards email, I would say a crowd less Lord’s is one of the best crowd-less debut grounds, with the history and the long room, but it pales in comparison to many other grounds in the world for atmospheric openers. Not even the top 2 in England, below Headlingley and Edgbaston.” Lord’s is a special kind of atmosphere - if you like it proper and establishment-raucous. I’d throw in Old Trafford with a full Test crowd, or for a Roses T20 game, as a more pints and pie alternative. 45th over: New Zealand 132-3 (Conway 61, Nicholls 8) Root, long sleeves, slip of a boy, rubs the ball on his trousers and wheels in, twisting on his left foot pivot as he delivers. Largely unbothered, New Zealand pick four from the over. 44th over: New Zealand 128-3 (Conway 59, Nicholls 6) Mark Wood swaps ends to have a go from the Nursery End. The ball suddenly seems to misbehave, shooting through low before zipping through at helmet height. A slightly nervous Bracey fumbles with his glovework. 43rd over: New Zealand 127-3 (Conway 59, Nicholls 6) Talking of no front-line spinner, Joe Root has his first bowl of the Test, whizzing through an over while both batsmen pick up a single. 42nd over: New Zealand 125-3 (Conway 58, Nicholls 5) Robinson is a chunky guy, much more heavily built than the bamboo-svelte Broad or Anderson, and his boots will hack holes out of the the turf . The umpire seems to have a quiet word about his follow through but I didn’t spot a pencil or a notepad so I think it’s unofficial. “Summer feels like it’s really here, and with that the now annual moan… “taps Neil Harris. “What is going on with the over rate? Is anyone serious about doing anything about it….” It’s certainly going to be a problem for England in this Test with no front-line spinner. 41st over: New Zealand 124-3 (Conway 58, Nicholls 5) Mark Wood throws himself into another exhausting over on a warm day: four 94mph balls, one 95, one 93. Conway tries to turn the last off his hip, but misses. “A question for your Kiwi readers,” writes Richard Morris. “Of course Conway will be delighted to make 50 on debut, but genuine question - while doing it at Lords would be the extra thick Royal icing on the cake for any English player, is it the ‘best’ place for a New Zealander? or would it be more of a buzz to do it at Auckland or Canterbury? Actually - is that even true for English players? I suspect our Yorkshire brethren are throwing things at their screen and yelling Headingley, even as I type...” Duck, Richard! 40th over: New Zealand 120-3 (Conway 57, Nicholls 2) Thanks Rob, brilliant stuff as always. Robinson continues from the pavilion end - where lines and lines of empty white bucket seats sit. At least Taylor didn’t have to weave his way through an awkward silence when he walked back after his scratchy 14. Just three off the over, and an lbw shout against Nicholls that Robinson fancied but Root didn’t. Nicholls is not out! Yep, it pitched outside leg and England lose one of their three reviews. That was the last ball of the over, so it’s time for me to hand over to the great Tanya Aldred for the rest of the day. You can email her on tanya.aldred.freelance@theguardian.com. Cheerio! 39th over: New Zealand 117-3 (Conway 54, Nicholls 2) Wood has a big LBW shout against Nicholls turned down. It looked like it pitched well outside leg stump, but Joe Root has decided to review. I’ll be very surprised if this is out. 38th over: New Zealand 116-3 (Conway 53, Nicholls 2) The new batsman Henry Nicholls pushed his first ball past backward point for a couple. That’s plumb. Taylor falls over towards the off side and is trapped in front by a classic nipbacker. Beautifully done by Ollie Robinson, who has two for 20 and is making a really impressive debut. Taylor goes for an extremely scratchy 14. 37th over: New Zealand 114-2 (Conway 53, Taylor 14) With New Zealand starting to look more comfortable, Mark Wood is brought back into the attack. He starts the process of dragging Conway from his comfort zone with a lovely short ball that beats Conway’s attempted uppercut. A really good maiden from Wood. “Afternoon Rob,” says Andrew Benzeval. “All this talk of being old, and then you point out that LRPL Taylor is somehow 37 years old. That can’t possibly be right, unless I’m now in my early for- ah.” 36th over: New Zealand 114-2 (Conway 53, Taylor 13) England go up for a leg-side strangle when Conway flicks at Robinson, but it was an autopilot appeal, with precisely 0.00 per cent conviction. “Is there a batsman anywhere who is good as Ross Taylor is, who manages to look as scratchy as Ross Taylor does just now?” asks Max Bonnell. “If he goes on to make a score England will look back at his first 30 balls and wonder how they managed not to dismiss him.” This was one of the 48 gazillion things I loved about Kevin Pietersen. He could look Don Bradman and Alan Mullally, sometimes in the same over. 35th over: New Zealand 110-2 (Conway 51, Taylor 13) Conway reaches a superb debut fifty in an appropriate manner, driving Broad handsomely through extra cover for four. He has played that shot beautifully. It’s been a really impressive performance: 91 balls, six fours. 34th over: New Zealand 102-2 (Conway 47, Taylor 13) Ollie Robinson replaces Jimmy Anderson (11-2-31-1) and has a muted LBW shout against Taylor. The line was good but it was too high. Taylor then misses a cut at a big nipbacker that cramps him. That was a fine comeback over from Robinson, with no looseners in sight. 33rd over: New Zealand 102-2 (Conway 47, Taylor 13) “I went to school with Aftab,” says Mark Hooper. “My memory of his Test career was him being hyped up as the saviour of the England side, treated appalling and dropped after never being given a proper chance. It felt more like a collective failure of the selectors and management set-up than to blame a kid with no Test experience.” Yeah, barring exceptional circumstances nobody should only get two Tests. Though it’s no excuse, England were such a mess that summer – they had no coach, at least four captains and a selection policy that was inspired by childhood games of blind man’s buff. 32nd over: New Zealand 100-2 (Conway 46, Taylor 12) Taylor inside-edges Anderson to fine leg for a couple. Anderson throws his hands up in the air because he knows how close that was to an extremely good LBW shout. England would love to dismiss Taylor early, because if he gets in he can do all sorts of damage. When Anderson throws a tempter outside off stump, Taylor misses another booming drive - but then he shows his class with a graceful drive past mid-on for four. 31st over: New Zealand 92-2 (Conway 45, Taylor 5) Conway edges a drive at Broad on the bounce to third slip. They said it changes when the sun goes down around here, and the ball has nibbled a bit more since that happened 10-15 minutes ago. 30th over: New Zealand 91-2 (Conway 45, Taylor 4) “Afternoon, Rob,” says Richard O’Hagan. “David Bowden’s email (26th over) just sent me down the very short wormhole - more of a worm divot, really - of Aftab Habib’s Test career. I played in a charity game with him the week before his debut, in which he proved himself adept not only at dispatching Berkshire’s finest bowlers around the ground, but also at bowling with either arm and throwing the ball from behind his back. I have often wondered how he would’ve fared had he done some proper practice before the game - although his debut was a rare 1990s England victory, albeit a game that they somehow won after being 45 for seven in their first innings.” My memory of his debut is that it was signposted in the press well in advance, in a matter-of-fact way, even though he’d never been on an A tour and wasn’t in particularly good form at the start of the season. 29th over: New Zealand 91-2 (Conway 45, Taylor 4) Broad appeals unsuccesfully for LBW when Taylor falls over towards the off side. It looked like it was going down, though Joe Root did discuss a review before deciding against it. Two balls later, Taylor is beaten by a jaffa that straightens sharply. He’s beaten again, recklessly chasing a wide outswinger, and then again off the last ball. That was a quite majestic maiden over from Broad. 28th over: New Zealand 91-2 (Conway 45, Taylor 4) Conway, who has been quiet either side of lunch, drives Anderson for a single. The cheap wicket of Williamson is such a bonus for England, though they still have a lot of work to do as New Zealand bat very deep. Even the No11, Neil Wagner, has a highest Test score of 66. Jimmy Anderson, by the way, now has 615 Test wickets. He’s four behind Anil Kumble, who is No3 on the all-time list. 27th over: New Zealand 89-2 (Conway 44, Taylor 3) Broad returns to the attack, probably with Ross Taylor in mind - he has dismissed him 10 times in Test cricket, more than anyone else. England have only gone and looked at the data, haven’t they. Taylor is beaten by a good delivery and then signals to the balcony for some eye drops - either that or, as Bumble suggests on Sky, a glass of red wine. 26th over: New Zealand 87-2 (Conway 44, Taylor 1) Ross Taylor is the new batter, which means we have a 38-year-old bowling to a 37-year-old. There’s hope for us all some of you. “Hi Rob,” says David Bowden. “I suspect Robin Hazelhurst (12:39) has blocked out that 1999 series in terms of humiliations. I’d only just properly gotten into cricket on the back of the South Africa series &amp; the Channel 4 excitement, and that series was both a crash course and agonisingly drawn out education in Watching England In The Nineties. Have been full of love and admiration for New Zealand cricket ever since but I hope our brave boys today don’t forget they’re avenging the memories of poor cowering Chris Read, the vast batless plains around Aftab Habib’s off stump &amp; Peter Such’s battling 51-ball duck.” Great days. My abiding memory has four words and nine syllables: Caddick, Mullally, Tufnell, Giddins. That’s the seventh time he has dismissed Williamson in Test cricket, more than anyone else. It was a really good delivery from Anderson, which jagged back from a length. Williamson played a solid-looking defensive stroke, but he was a fraction too late and the ball deflected back onto the off stump. Jimmy Anderson gets Kane Williamson in the first over after lunch! The players are back out. The weather remains glorious, and there’s a century out there for someone. “I haven’t seen any of the Test so far, just followed it on the OBO,” says Steve Hudson. “You say Wood has averaged virtually 94mph today – that’s faster than I can ever remember an English bowler bowling before. Does it LOOK that quick? Or could it be that some speedguns tend to err on the speedy side of strictly accurate? I seem to remember a few years ago South African speedguns seemed to exaggerate all bowling speeds by a few mph.” It looks that quick, and it’s consistent with his speeds since he changed his run-up. I think the technology is pretty good these days. It’s certainly come a long way from the early speedgun that had Mark Ealham bowling faster than Wasim Akram at Lord’s in 1996. 25th over: New Zealand 85-1 (Conway 43, Williamson 13) Another yeasty over from Wood, a maiden to Williamson, takes us to lunch. It’s been a good morning for New Zealand, who won a decent toss and batted sensibly to reach 85 for one. The first session of the series was dominated by two debutants: Devon Conway played some stylish drives in his unbeaten 43, and Ollie Robinson picked up his first Test wicket when Tom Latham dragged on. See you in half an hour! 24th over: New Zealand 85-1 (Conway 43, Williamson 13) Anderson has another strangled shout for LBW against Conway. There was a late inside-edge, without which Conway would have been in big trouble. A maiden from Anderson, who has been as parsimonious as ever: 7-1-19-0. “Andrew Moore wants us not to create a narrative that doesn’t exist,” says Felix Wood. “The day he meets humans is going to be an upsetting one for him.” 23rd over: New Zealand 85-1 (Conway 43, Williamson 13) Williamson plays a slightly loose drive at Wood, which takes a thick edge and flies wide of the slips for four. Wood’s speeds this morning have been hella (that’s right) impressive: his fastest ball was 95.2mph, and his average speed is almost 94mph. 22nd over: New Zealand 81-1 (Conway 43, Williamson 9) With 15 minutes until lunch, James Anderson replaces Ollie Robinson (6-2-17-1). Anderson has a good record against Williamson; no bowler has dismissed him as often in Test cricket. Williamson, beaten by the second ball, flicks the third into the leg side for three. “Robinson has impressed on debut but I’ve been particularly struck by Conway, a really elegant left-hander with shades of Gower about him,” says Colum Fordham. “I realise this is a green strip, but I think England have missed a trick by not including Leach. The Kiwis have a very useful left-arm spinner in Santner and he may prove crucial as the test goes on.” Agreed. England do have Joe Root and Dan Lawrence, and they won’t be bowling last, but it was still a bit of a surprise. 21st over: New Zealand 76-1 (Conway 41, Williamson 6) Wood hits Conway on the arm again, this time from round the wicket, and then beats him with a trampolining lifter. This is excellent stuff from Wood, the hot hot heat that England have craved. Conway responds with a stylish flick-pull for four, albeit with the aid of a misfield from Crawley on the fence at midwicket. “As a Somerset fan, this is the worst possible scenario,” says Mark Hooper. “Leach and Overton constantly being called up for the Test squad but not playing - ditto Gregory &amp; Banton for the short-form squads - when we potentially have our best chance of winning the Championship.” I’m not sure how the bubbles will work this summer, particularly after 21st June, so it might not be too bad. You won’t see Leach but the others could be available. 20th over: New Zealand 72-1 (Conway 37, Williamson 6) Robinson to Williamson, round two. He continues to hammer a fifth-stump line, then starts to get closer as the over progresses. Williamson is slightly late on his defensive stroke to the fifth delivery, which prompts a few oohs and aash. Another maiden from Robinson, who has made an encouraging start. “Hi Rob,” says Robin Hazlehurst. “Maybe England fans are not as nervous or bothered about New Zealand as about Australia because we don’t have too many memories of being humiliated by them? Losing to them yes, but not that cringing despair that Australia have inflicted at times. Even if NZ win this series 2-0 and both Tests inside three days, it probably wouldn’t feel like a humiliation, because, y’know, circumstances.” 19th over: New Zealand 72-1 (Conway 37, Williamson 6) Conway thumps Wood past mid-off for four, a lovely drive and an impressive response to being hit at the end of Wood’s first over. Then Williamson gets his first boundary with a classy square drive. This being a day of the week, he looks in excellent touch. “A lot of people seem to be falling over themselves to claim how it is such an outrage that NZ are so underrated, yet most of the commentary and comment I have read has been about how good this side are,” says Andrew Moore. “Let’s not create a narrative that doesn’t exist.” As we discussed earlier, I think it’s mainly an unconscious thing. That’s what it makes interesting. 18th over: New Zealand 62-1 (Conway 32, Williamson 1) Williamson is beaten by a good delivery from Robinson that holds its line outside off stump. Robinson spoke about Plan A for Williamson before the game, and it’s clear he is trying to drag Williamson across his crease. He ends a terrific over, his first maiden, by beating Williamson again outside off stump. 17th over: New Zealand 62-1 (Conway 32, Williamson 1) Now then. It’s time for a change of pace, with Mark Wood replacing Stuart Broad (7-2-22-0). His first ball, timed at 91mph, is inside edged for a couple by Conway. A single brings the new batsman Kane Williamson on strike; he leans into his first ball and drops it for a single on the off side. A lively over from Wood ends with a 95mph bumper that thumps Conway on the arm. “There has been a lot of respect shown to NZ’s bowling attack, but not enough to the batting lineup,” says G Play. “Four guys averaging over 40, the best keeper batsman since Gilchrist, and the new Mike Hussey on debut.” I wouldn’t go that far, though I know what you mean. I think everyone knows about Williamson’s serene genius, but Latham and Watling in particular are a bit underrated. 16th over: New Zealand 58-1 (Conway 29, Williamson 0) That was the last ball of the over. It’s been a promising start from Robinson, whose height and seam movement make him an awkward customer. A first Test wicket for Ollie Robinson! Latham felt tentatively outside off stump and dragged the ball onto the stumps. I think he was unsettled by the previous delivery, which snapped sharply off the seam to beat the outside edge. 15th over: New Zealand 56-0 (Latham 22, Conway 28) Too straight from Broad, and Latham rolls the wrists to put him away for four. He’s a fine player, who averages 55 in his last 20 Tests, though he is beaten on the drive later in the over. After seven overs, it’s probably time for Broad to be replaced by Mark Wood. 14th over: New Zealand 51-0 (Latham 18, Conway 28) Conway drives Robinson pleasantly through mid-off for three to bring up an assured fifty partnership. At 29, Conway looks like he knows his game like the back of his bat. 13th over: New Zealand 47-0 (Latham 17, Conway 25) Latham rides a lifter from Broad and steers it to third man for his first boundary. That was a really accomplished stroke. As the clock ticks past midday, the camera cuts to a member in his egg and bacon tie, pouring some fizz into a metal beaker. It’s also time for the players to take drinks. “Enjoying the coverage of the Test and how Conway has looked so far,” says Ben Macintyre. “I noticed you mentioned that English coverage tends to patronise NZ to which I would like - having seen the side go to #1 in the world and soundly beat India at home as well as England - to add a contrarian view. Lads, it’s England.” I don’t think any reasonable England fan would have a problem with that, as there is a bit of Spursyness about most of our sports teams. What intrigues me about the patronising attitude towards New Zealand is that it’s almost entirely unconscious. It’s why most people at Lord’s were nowhere near as nervous before the World Cup final as they had been before the semi-final against Australia. 12th over: New Zealand 41-0 (Latham 11, Conway 25) A moment of fortune for Conway, who edges an expansive drive off Robinson for four. That could easily have gone to hand. Joe Root brings in a fourth slip as a result. “Morning Rob,” says Brian Withington. “Gary Naylor’s examples of named player exhortations had me reflexively reaching for one of my pre-penned homages to Paul Simon, ‘Fifty Ways to Lose Your Wicket’. This includes such lines as ‘Miss a straight ball, Paul’ and ‘Pad up and pray, Ray’. As followers of CCLive! will testify, there’s plenty more where that came from ...” Both above and below the line, that bloody county blog is in serious danger of giving the internet a good name. 11th over: New Zealand 35-0 (Latham 11, Conway 19) Broad changes ends to replace Anderson (5-0-14-0) and promptly beats Latham with a nice lifting delivery. The ball has gone past the edge a few times; even so, most of the early signs point to a day of hard yakka for England’s all-seam attack. “Have Leach and Overton been released to play for Somerset against Hampshire tomorrow?” says Sam Tarr. “Asking for a friend...” Arf. I assume not because of the Covid bubble, or whatever we’re supposed to call it now. I’ll be honest with you, I’ve completely lost track of what you can and can’t do, and I’m also getting a bit fed up of people gawping at me when I pick my nose in Tesco’s. A bit of privacy, please. 10th over: New Zealand 35-0 (Latham 11, Conway 19) The debutant Ollie Robinson replaces Broad (4-1-12-0). He has a lot going for him - height, seam movement, accuracy and aggression - and I can’t wait to see him in action. Robinson’s languid run-up and action remind me a bit of Derek Pringle, though Angus Fraser is the most common comparison. His first delivery is a no-ball, but his line and length are spot on from the start. Conway flicks off the pads for a couple and then fences a legcutter through gully for two more. 9th over: New Zealand 30-0 (Latham 11, Conway 15) There’s a strangled LBW shout when Anderson swings one back into Conway’s pads. It was comfortably missing leg stump. He switches around the wicket to Latham, who offers no stroke a delivery timed at 88mph. Anderson turns 39 next month and he’s still capable of bowling at 88mph. 8th over: New Zealand 29-0 (Latham 11, Conway 14) Nothing much is happening for England, though Broad in particular is persisting with an attacking length to the left-handers. He beats Latham, who upbraids himself for fishing well wide of off stump. “Why is Chris Broad officiating at this Test match when his son is playing in it?” asks Andrew Bell. They have stopped using neutral umpires and match referees because of Covid, and I think Chris Broad is the only English referee on the elite panel. He fined Stuart last summer. 7th over: New Zealand 29-0 (Latham 11, Conway 14) Conway gets four more, this time off Anderson, with a lovely extra cover drive. He hasn’t been watertight this morning, though, and an inside edge flies past leg stump off the next delivery. “Maybe a shout out for Holland vs Ireland being played today as part of the ICC Super League,” says Jerry Dawson. “For the first time ever, a cricket game is being broadcast live on Dutch TV. Though so far, not doing the Dutch team much good – they lost their first five wickets for 53.” 6th over: New Zealand 23-0 (Latham 10, Conway 9) Conway gets his first boundary with a crisp cover drive off Broad, and plays the shot again next ball for a couple. An affronted Broad responds with a sharp legcutter that beats the edge. Before the game, Simon Doull said Conway is New Zealand’s most exciting find since Kane Williamson. His career statistics are pretty spectacular. “Looking back on the coverage from the 2015 series, I see that the Lord’s Test was covered by our late, much missed, Dan Lucas,” says Simon Thomas. “What a joy his commentary was. So raising a glass to him this morning (if I wasn’t working).” It’s hard to believe he’s been gone almost five years. Never mind the cricket – there is so much great music that I want to play to him so that he can tell me how rubbish it is and how much of an old man I am. 5th over: New Zealand 16-0 (Latham 10, Conway 2) The pitch looks really good. There has been a bit of movement, swing rather than seam, but nothing to alarm Latham and Conway. Latham forces Anderson through mid-on for a couple, and that’s your lot. “Bit disappointing that Sky are playing a soundtrack from a village match under the pictures,” says Gary Naylor, “with lots of ‘C’mon lads’ and ‘Lovely stuff’. Surely if it were from the effects mics at Lord’s, we’d have ‘Execute your plans Stu’ and ‘Active rest at the end of the over Jimmy’.” 4th over: New Zealand 14-0 (Latham 8, Conway 2) It’s time for our first look at the debutant Devon Conway. He gets his first runs in Test cricket with a thick inside edge off Broad, who gets a bit greedy as a result and tries for the LBW next ball. Nice plan, shame about the execution: Broad strays onto the pads and the ball runs away for four leg-byes. 3rd over: New Zealand 8-0 (Latham 8, Conway 0) Burns saves a couple of good runs with a good stop at backward point, and then sprints back to stop a thick edge from Latham reaching the boundary. Anderson’s last delivery is a good one that snakes back to beat Latham on the inside. “I know it’s not the point you were making, but between your mention of bar snacks, the weather over the last few days, and the fact that Test Cricket Is Only Bleeding Happening, I cannot think of anywhere I’d rather be than sat in the Sand Bar in Tenby, with wasabi peas and a glass of beer,” hics Matt Dony. “Feels like summer.” Wasabi peas. I bet you take the Observer on a Sunday. (NB: clip contains East End language.) 2nd over: New Zealand 4-0 (Latham 4, Conway 0) Stuart Broad, who is vice-captain in this game, shares the new ball. He starts round the wicket to Latham, the angle that has brought him so much success against David Warner in particular. When he strays onto the pads, Latham puts him away behind square for a couple. A single off the last ball means the debutant Conway will have to wait a little longer to face his first ball in Test cricket. “Tremendous to hear that England are planning seven straight wins before the Ashes,” says Pete Salmon. “Is anyone running a book on when that will be put to one side. I’m going with tea on day two tomorrow. Prove me wrong Engurland!” 1st over: New Zealand 1-0 (Latham 1, Conway 0) James Anderson, the man with 614 Test wickets, takes the first over. There’s a little bit of swing to the left-handed Tom Latham, who survives an optimistic LBW appeal from the fifth ball. It pitched well outside leg. TMS link Thanks to Nick Wiltsher for doing the necessary. The players are applauded onto the field by other human beings. It’s such a thrill to have crowds back, especially in such glorious weather. “What is going on mate?” says Amod Paranjape. “Not a single mail of pessimism from the English supporters. Really.” ‘Lads, it’s New Zealand.’ “Interesting comment that England are only missing Stokes, Buttler and Archer from their ‘best XI’,” says Jonathan McKinley. “Which of the three chosen for this match would you replace? Crawley, Bracey and Wood? Presumably there would be room for Leach also (for Robinson?) in the right conditions. Or do we say goodbye to Broad?” So much depends on conditions and context, and the picture changes all the time. But if England were playing the first Ashes Test in Brisbane tomorrow, and everyone was fit, I think the team would be Burns, Sibley, Crawley, Root, Stokes, Pope, Buttler, Archer, Leach, Wood, Broad or Anderson. “I’m really looking forward to this series - especially as I have tickets for the Edgbaston Test - but I’m struggling to pick a winner,” writes Steven Pye. “Is it cowardly to sit on the fence and predict 1-1?” I’d prefer that to 0-1, which, as Steven writes here, was the score in 1986. “No Jack Leach, no specialist spinner?” says Henry Lubienski. “We’re moving into uncomfortable territory here. Either they’re completely daft or I’m completely daft. Could you (gently) offer a judgement?” Given the weather I would have played Leach, probably ahead of Robinson, but I can honestly see both sides. This fence gets more comfortable by the day. “Morning, Rob, and a fine one it is too, very suitable for the start of the summer proper,” writes John Starbuck. “I can’t help feeling that a preamble takes place just before a stroll around the ground but it’s still worth doing. Anyway, don’t worry about patronising people such as the Kiwis, since we all do it, even them. It must be in the game’s DNA to have encouraging appreciation of one’s opponents, at least in public. What happens in the dressing room tends to stay there, unless an injury occurs.” “Greetings from the Emerald Isle!” writes Séin Healy. “Giddy for what will be almost six months, of top-quality cricket, although the Ashes might impact my sleep (and drinking) plans over the festive period. I am sure may have asked already, but can you put the word out for the TMS overseas link please? They seem to have buried it even deeper in the depths of the interest these days for us wanting to listen in Ireland. Thanks a mill and enjoy the next five (probably three) days.” I think we might see a few more five-day Tests this summer, as England are apparently keen to play the long game in preparation for the Ashes. And this piece, from Tim de Lisle, has more good lines and observations than most writers manage in a calendar year. New Zealand’s last Test on this ground, six years ago, was a feelgood classic. Andrew Miller, Cricinfo UK editor and friend of the OBO, has written a belting piece on the significance of a magical match. Fantasy Cricket The nice folk on the county blog have set up a fantasy league for the T20 blast. If you want to join, click this little thing. The code is NEKVIVOO. Jack Leach has been omitted, a dubious decision though not a surprising one. There are three debutants: James Bracey, Ollie Robinson and the New Zealand opener Devon Conway. With New Zealand batting, all three will be front and centre this morning. England Burns, Sibley, Crawley, Root, Pope, Lawrence, Bracey (wk), Robinson, Wood, Broad, Anderson. New Zealand Latham, Conway, Williamson (c), Taylor, Nicholls, Watling (wk), de Grandhomme, Santner, Jamieson, Southee, Wagner. Joe Root says England would have batted as well, though he doesn’t seem too disappointed - there’s a decent amount of grass on the pitch so England have the chance to do some damage this morning. Kane Williamson says it looks a good pitch. They are playing a spinner, Mitch Santner, so bowling last in these conditions could be a decent advantage. There are plenty of interesting subplots in this game. Two, in particular, stand out. The six England batsmen not called Joe Root are battling for four places against India, and New Zealand want to improve their away record. Just playing away from home helps - this is only their third series since 2016. James Bracey and Ollie Robinson will make their Test debuts. It looks like England have omitted Jack Leach, which is a bit of a gamble given the glorious weather in north London. I’m really excited to see Robinson in particular. His record since the start of the 2018 season is outrageous: 195 wickets at 17.29. And he can bat. New Zealand are usually the hors d’oeuvre of the English summer. They come over for two or three Tests, are unintentionally patronised whenever they win or lose, and then leave before the main event. This year, they are more like the complimentary bar snack you receive when your table is late. Their two-Test series against England isn’t even on the menu, also known in some cultures as the Future Tours Programme; nor is it part of the next World Test Championship. And though this is 3rd v 2nd in the Test rankings, it is seen by most as a glorified warm-up for more important matches against the No1 side, India. New Zealand play them in the World Test Championship final later this month; England’s five-Test series kicks off in August. Test cricket may not yet have a second division, but it has multiple tiers. For a variety of reasons – the schedule, the FTP, the WTC, the IPL, the OCG – some games are bigger than others. England’s five Test series in 2021 could probably be split into three levels. Tier 1 Australia (A) Tier 2 India (A), India (H) Tier 3 Sri Lanka (A), New Zealand (H) There is a lot of sincere admiration for world cricket’s great overachievers (see, I’ve done it! I’ve patronised them without realising!) within English cricket. But there’s also a subconscious voice that will forever say, ‘Lads, it’s New Zealand’. On the face of it, this is another example of England telling New Zealand how great they are while simultaneously belitting them. But as Grady Tripp would say, it’s a little more complicated than that. New Zealand will be back next summer for a more ostensibly meaningful series, albeit still as the warm-up act. These two Tests, added to the schedule at the last minute, are essentially a goodwill gesture to broadcasters. Money is the main motivation, there’s no point saying otherwise, but there is a bit more to it than that. With the return of crowds at Lord’s and Edgbaston, this series feels like a modern take on the Victory Tests of 1945. Let’s hope somebody catches the mood and plays like Keith Miller did then. There are a few contenders, from Joe Root to the exciting debutant Devon Conway (check out these numbers). For all the talk of England’s rotation, the standard of the cricket, especially the fast bowling, will be high. And this is not, as some have suggested, as England A team. They are missing only Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler and Jofra Archer from their best XI, if such a thing exists anymore, and Stokes and Archer are injured anyway. New Zealand are without Trent Boult because of his post-IPL isolation, yet they still have a brainy, brawny seam attack* of Tim Southee, Neil Wagner and the fascinating Kyle Jamieson. As bar snacks go, this is definitely more Hawksmoor than Jefferson Davis Wetherspoons. * Is that patronising as well?

their shot.</p> <p>Pharmacy chains across the country, including Albertsons, CVS, Rite-Aid and Walgreens, will also offer extended hours from now until July 4 to make it easier to get vaccinated.</p> <p>Vice-President <strong>Kamala Harris </strong>is launching a “nation-wide tour to reach millions of Americans who still need protection against the virus”.</p> <p>“The Vice President’s travel will be anchored in the South, and the First Lady, the Second Gentleman, and members of the Cabinet will also join the Administration’s tour to communities across the country,” the White House said in its factsheet about the new initiatives.</p> <p>The administration is also partnering with Black-owned barbershops and beauty salons to start “Shots at the Shop,” which will allow the businesses to share vaccine information with their customers.</p> <p>“The ‘Shots at the Shop’ initiative will invite participation from across the country, with a particular focus on supporting shops in some of the hardest-hit localities still experiencing significant gaps in vaccination rates,” the White House said.</p> <p><strong>Joe Biden </strong>will likely tout all these new developments when he delivers

<p>Arizona, where<strong> Donald Trump</strong> narrowly lost to <strong>Joe Biden</strong> in November, has become a focal point for conspiracy theorists who falsely believe the election was stolen.

They’re offering conspiracies that only make our lives worse.”</p> <p>In recent months, Hobbs, elected to her office in 2018, has taken on a leading role in monitoring and calling out a GOP-led review of 2.1m ballots cast in Maricopa county, the most populous in Arizona. </p> <p>She has <a href=\"https://azsos.gov/sites/default/files/5.5.21_letter_to_ken_bennett.pdf\">drawn attention</a> to shoddy practices auditors are using and monitors deployed by her office have regularly noted significant problems in procedures.

Psaki opened the briefing by reiterating the administration’s announcement that it is launching a “month of action” to get more Americans vaccinated by July 4. The month of action will involve an “all of America sprint” to reach Joe Biden’s goal of having 70% of American adults at least partially vaccinated by July 4, Psaki said. As of today, 63% of American adults have received at least one coronavirus vaccine dose, according to the White House. The Biden administration has announced a new series of initiatives aimed at encouraging more Americans to get vaccinated against coronavirus, as the president looks to have 70% of Americans at least partially vaccinated by July 4. The White House announced that four of largest US childcare providers will offer free childcare for caregivers who are getting the vaccine or recovering after their shot. Pharmacy chains across the country, including Albertsons, CVS, Rite-Aid and Walgreens, will also offer extended hours from now until July 4 to make it easier to get vaccinated. Vice-President Kamala Harris is launching a “nation-wide tour to reach millions of Americans who still need protection against the virus”. “The Vice President’s travel will be anchored in the South, and the First Lady, the Second Gentleman, and members of the Cabinet will also join the Administration’s tour to communities across the country,” the White House said in its factsheet about the new initiatives. The administration is also partnering with Black-owned barbershops and beauty salons to start “Shots at the Shop,” which will allow the businesses to share vaccine information with their customers. “The ‘Shots at the Shop’ initiative will invite participation from across the country, with a particular focus on supporting shops in some of the hardest-hit localities still experiencing significant gaps in vaccination rates,” the White House said. Joe Biden will likely tout all these new developments when he delivers an update on vaccine distribution efforts this afternoon. The Guardian’s Sam Levine reports: Katie Hobbs, Arizona’s top election official who became one of the leading voices beating back conspiracies about the 2020 election, announced Wednesday she was seeking the Democratic nomination for governor in her state. Arizona, where Donald Trump narrowly lost to Joe Biden in November, has become a focal point for conspiracy theorists who falsely believe the election was stolen. After the election, Hobbs beat back baseless claims of fraud and ensured that the state’s presidential electors were certified for Biden to properly reflect the outcome of the popular vote. “We had a job to do, and that job was simple: Count every vote. When you’re under attack, some would have you believe you have two choices: To fight or give in. But there’s a third option: Get the job done,” Hobbs said. “The other side isn’t offering policies to make our lives better. They’re offering conspiracies that only make our lives worse.” In recent months, Hobbs, elected to her office in 2018, has taken on a leading role in monitoring and calling out a GOP-led review of 2.1m ballots cast in Maricopa county, the most populous in Arizona. She has drawn attention to shoddy practices auditors are using and monitors deployed by her office have regularly noted significant problems in procedures. A compilation of notes published by Hobbs’ office on Tuesday, for example, detail security lapses, technological glitches, and confusion about who is in charge. The details revealed by her office have underscore how unprofessional the audit is. Hobbs’ entrance in the governor’s race will likely bring even more attention to who her successor will be. Mark Finchem, an Arizona legislator who is a prominent advocate of the Stop the Steal movement, is already seeking the Republican nomination. House speaker Nancy Pelosi has reportedly told Democrats that multiple options remain to launch an expansive review of the Capitol insurrection, after Senate Republicans killed the bill to form a bipartisan commission to study the attack. NBC News reports: During a conference call with members of the House Democratic Caucus, Pelosi detailed options, including the potential the Senate could vote a second time and try to overcome the Republican filibuster, according to two sources who were on the call. She shot down a suggestion raised by some House Democrats that President Joe Biden could form a presidential commission, calling it not a workable idea, one source on the call said. A presidential commission would need Congress to grant subpoena power and allocate funding. Both chambers would have to vote to approve, which looks unlikely after the Senate Republicans’ filibuster last week. Republicans successfully blocked the commission bill from advancing last week, after only six Republican senators voted with Democrats to start debate on the legislation. Democrats needed 10 Republican votes to overcome the filibuster of the bill. The US secretary of state has warned leaders of Pacific countries about “threats to the rules-based international order” and “economic coercion”, in what appears to be a veiled swipe at China’s growing influence in the region. Antony Blinken was addressing leaders and their delegates from 11 Pacific countries and territories including Fiji, Solomon Islands, Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, French Polynesia, Palau and Marshall Islands as part of the Pacific Islands Conference of Leaders, which is held in Hawaii. Blinken reiterated US support for Pacific island nations as they face the “shared challenges that we have to confront together”, including Covid-19 and the climate crisis. But the main focus of his televised address was China’s growing influence in the region. “Economic coercion across the region is on the rise. The US is all for more development and investment in the islands, but that investment should adhere to international standards for environmentally and socially sustainable development and should be pursued transparently, with public consultation,” he said. “And every country, no matter its size, should always be able to make choices without fear of retribution.” The CDC’s decision to loosen mask requirements has not led to any noticeable increase in the spread of coronavirus, as the number of new cases in the US has continued to fall in the past few weeks. Meanwhile, the number of first-shot vaccine appointments has leveled off in recent weeks after a worrisome decline in the month leading up to the mask announcement. The New York Times explains: First, new Covid cases have continued to decline at virtually the same rate as during the month before the C.D.C. announcement, which came on May 13 ... Overall, daily new cases have fallen by almost 75 percent since mid-April and by more than 90 percent from the peak in January. ... On the other hand, the C.D.C.’s change has had a noticeable effect on behavior in a positive way. ... For the previous month, the number of daily shots in the U.S. had been falling, as the country began to run out of adults who were eager to be vaccinated. With a few days of the mask announcement, the decline leveled off. The White House shared the New York Times piece in an email with reporters, and Joe Biden will likely tout the encouraging trends when he delivers an update on vaccination efforts this afternoon. Donald Trump has shuttered the blog that he started less than a month ago, a senior adviser to the former president said. Jason Miller told CNBC that the page “From the Desk of Donald J. Trump” had been deleted from the former president’s website and “will not be returning”. “It was just auxiliary to the broader efforts we have and are working on,” Miller said in an email to CNBC. “Hoping to have more information on the broader efforts soon, but I do not have a precise awareness of timing.” The blog, which debuted last month, was a clear effort by Trump to amplify his message despite his social media bans, which were put in place after he incited the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol. However, the blog never gained much traction, in part because of readers’ inability to reply to Trump’s statements, as they would do on Twitter or Facebook. Twitter also suspended an account that pulled content from Trump’s blog, @DJTDesk, because the social media company said it violated the platform’s ban evasion policy. Portable microwave weapons capable of causing the mysterious spate of “Havana Syndrome” brain injuries in US diplomats and spies have been developed by several countries in recent years, according to leading American experts in the field. A US company also made the prototype of such a weapon for the marine corps in 2004. The weapon, codenamed Medusa, was intended to be small enough to fit in a car, and cause a “temporarily incapacitating effect” but “with a low probability of fatality or permanent injury”. There is no evidence that the research was taken beyond the prototype phase, and a report on that stage has been removed from a US navy website. Scientists with knowledge of the project said that ethical considerations preventing human experimentation contributed to the project being shelved – but they said such consideration had not hindered US adversaries, including Russia, and possibly China. “The state of that science has for the most part been, if not abandoned, pretty much left fallow in the United States – but it has not been fallow elsewhere,” said James Giordano, professor of neurology and ethics at Georgetown University Medical Center. In case you missed it last night: A Democratic candidate won the special election to fill Interior Secretary Deb Haaland’s open House seat. Democratic state legislator Melanie Stansbury defeated Republican state senator Mark Moores by about 25 points, delivering a resounding victory for Democrats after the party’s poor performance in a Texas special election last month. Delivering a victory speech in Albuquerque, Stansbury said, “This moment is not just about standing up, but about leaning into the moment and bringing fundamental change to our politics and to our country.” Stansbury’s win will help to slightly bolster Democrats’ very narrow majority in the House. Once Stansbury is seated to represent New Mexico’s 1st District, Democrats will have a 220-211 advantage over Republicans. The margin of Stansbury’s victory was also encouraging to Democrats, given that Joe Biden carried the New Mexico district by 23 points in November. Haaland also won reelection to her seat by 16 points last year. Stansbury’s ability to improve upon Biden and Haaland’s numbers gave some Democrats hope that they can hold off a wave of Republican victories in next year’s midterms. However, the midterms are still about a year and a half away, so time will tell. The Guardian’s Sam Levine reports: For nearly five months, Democrats in state legislatures across the country have been scraping to do everything they can to stop an unprecedented onslaught of new voting restrictions from Republicans. They have given searing speeches on the floors of state legislatures. They have supported protests and even gotten arrested demonstrating against the bills. They have filed lawsuits challenging new restrictions almost immediately after they were signed into law. But despite their efforts, Democrats have not been able to stop sweeping new voting restrictions from going into place in states such as Arizona, Georgia, Florida, Iowa and Montana, where Republicans have used their legislative majorities to ram through the bills. But late on Sunday night something different happened in Texas. With Republicans on the verge of passing one of the most restrictive new voting laws in the country, Democrats in the state house of representatives walked out of the legislature, denying Republicans a quorum and killing the legislation. Governor Greg Abbott has fumed over the development and has pledged to call a special session to pass the bill. Be sure to read the fine print on the Anheuser-Busch vaccine giveaway: only 200,000 participants will get money to buy a free round after the US hits Joe Biden’s vaccination goal. And it may be a round for one person, as the beer company is only giving winners a $5.00 virtual debit card to purchase an Anheuser-Busch product. Those who want the chance to win one of the debit cards will also have to create a My Cooler Rewards account and upload a “picture of your favorite place to grab a beer”. Joe Biden will also deliver an update this afternoon on his administration’s efforts to get Americans vaccinated against coronavirus. The speech comes one month before July 4, Biden’s deadline to get 70% of American adults at least partially vaccinated for US Independence Day. The president is expected to announce a new partnership between the White House and the beer company Anheuser-Busch to encourage Americans to get their vaccines. The CEO of Anheuser-Busch said in an announcement this morning that the company will “buy Americans 21+ a round of beer when we reach the White House goal”. “We pride ourselves on stepping up both in times of need and in times of great celebration, and the past year has been no different,” said CEO Michel Doukeris. “As we look ahead to brighter days with renewed optimism, we are proud to work alongside the White House to make a meaningful impact for our country, our communities and our consumers.” The “Let’s Grab A Beer” initiative is only the latest in a string of US efforts to incentivize vaccinations. Perhaps most notably, the state of Ohio has been distributing $1 million lottery prizes to a handful of new vaccine recipients. Greetings from Washington, live blog readers. Joe Biden will meet this afternoon with Shelley Moore Capito, the senator who has been leading the Republican team negotiating with the White House over a potential infrastructure bill. The meeting comes almost one week after Capito and her fellow Republicans introduced their latest counteroffer, which proposed spending $928 billion for infrastructure projects over the next eight years. That offer was still a far cry from what Biden has called for spending. Of the $928 billion in Republicans’ plan, only $257 billion is considered new money, while the rest was baselines spending, meaning the funds that were already going to be used on infrastructure projects over the next eight years because of existing policies. In contrast, the president has proposed investing $1.7 trillion over baseline infrastructure spending, which is still less than the $2.25 trillion that he originally called for. So Democrats and Republicans remain miles apart on infrastructure, and Biden has signaled that he is ready for the negotiations to come to a close. “I told [Capito] we have to finish this really soon,” Biden said last Thursday. “We’re going to have to close this down soon.” The blog will have more details on the meeting coming up, so stay tuned.","charCount":"15067","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/joan-greve\">Joan E Greve</a> in Washington"},{"headline":"Etsy buys Depop in $1.6bn gen-Z push;

The UK is to begin negotiations to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, after its 11 members agreed that accession talks could begin. International trade secretary Liz Truss said CPTPP membership could deliver deeper access to fast-growing markets, such as Japan, Australia, Canada and Chile. Trade experts, though, argued that membership would have limited benefits, and not make up for losing frictionless trade with the EU. The US has announced new tariffs on six countries, including the UK, over their digital services taxes. But.... they’ve also been suspended for up to six months, to encourage leaders to agree a global deal on tax. The EU has also taken action, agreeing to force large multinational companies to publish a breakdown of the tax they pay in each of the bloc’s member states and in tax havens such as Seychelles. Etsy is trying to tap into the gen-Z crowd by acquiring Depop, the British second-hand fashion resale app, for $1.6bn (£1.1bn). Etsy CEO Josh Silverman said Depop was growing ‘like crazy, and that the ‘recommerce’ market of second-hand items was likely to boom over the coming years. Oil has rallied, after Opec+ stuck to its plan of only slowly easing production curbs. Brent crude is trading over $71 per barrel, on track for its highest closing price since May 2019. The US housing market appears to be cooling, with new mortgage applications dropping to their lowest since the start of the pandemic. Sky-high prices and low supply are hitting demand. In the UK, mortgage demand picked up after the government extended the stamp duty tax break. But people kept paying off their credit card bills in April, despite the lure of shops, pubs and restaurants reopening. Lockdown reading has helped the Harry Potter publisher Bloomsbury to its third profit upgrade of the year after a 22% surge in annual pre-tax profits. European budget airline Wizz Air has urged governments to lift travel restrictions faster, after plunging to a €576m (£497m) annual loss - and warning of further losses to come until curbs are eased. Australia’s economy has recovered its pandemic losses: The London stock market has closed a little higher, with the UK-focused FTSE 250 ending the day at a new record. Goodnight. GW In other tax news, the EU has agreed it will force large multinational companies to publish a breakdown of the tax they pay in each of the bloc’s member states and in tax havens such as Seychelles. The move piles pressure on the UK government to follow suit. After years of stalled talks, a deal was struck on Tuesday between EU governments and MEPs on country by country reporting, a policy designed to expose how some of the world’s biggest companies – such as Apple, Facebook and Google – avoid paying an estimated $500bn (£358bn) a year in taxes through shifting their profits. Under the new rules, companies with global revenues of at least €750m (£645m) over two consecutive years must publicly disclose how much tax they pay in each of the EU member states and in 19 jurisdictions put on black and grey lists that are regarded to varying degrees as being “non-cooperative”. More here: The FTSE 100 index has closed 27.5 points higher at 7108, up 0.4% today. That adds to yesterday’s rally, and is a new three-week closing high. Luxury fashion group Burberry (+3.5%) led the risers after an upgrade from Exane analysts. Oil giants BP (+2.2%) and Royal Dutch Shell (+2%) benefited from the jump in crude prices. Engineering firm Rolls-Royce (+3%) and commercial property group British Land (+2.3%) also rallied. The smaller FTSE 250 index also rose, gaining 0.25% to a new record closing high of 22933 points. More trade news. The US has announced - and immediately suspended - tariffs on certain goods from UK, Italy, Spain, Austria, India and Turkey over their digital services tax. The tariffs are being imposed after the US concluded that these digital taxes discriminated against US tech companies, were inconsistent with principles of international taxation, and burdened U.S. companies. These digital services taxes, on the revenues of technology giants, are designed to make firms such as Google and Facebook pay a fairer share of tax where they do business. United States Trade Representative Katherine Tai says the tariffs will be suspended for up to 180 days to give extra time to complete the ongoing multilateral negotiations on international tax at the OECD and in the G20. Tai explains: “The United States is focused on finding a multilateral solution to a range of key issues related to international taxation, including our concerns with digital services taxes. The United States remains committed to reaching a consensus on international tax issues through the OECD and G20 processes. Today’s actions provide time for those negotiations to continue to make progress while maintaining the option of imposing tariffs under Section 301 if warranted in the future.” Back in March, the US warned that the price of UK clothing and footwear, ceramics, beauty products and furniture exports to America could rise by a quarter, unless the digital services tax was dropped. The Biden administration is now pushing for a global tax deal that would impose a minimum 15% tax on the profits of big international tech companies, which could be agreed at this month’s G7 summit in Cornwall. Etsy is buying Depop, the British second-hand fashion resale app, for $1.6bn (£1.1bn) to tap into the fast-growing trend of generation Z young people reselling clothes online. Josh Silverman, the chief executive of Brooklyn-based Etsy, said: “We are simply thrilled to be adding Depop – what we believe to be the resale home for gen Z consumers – to the Etsy family.” Announcing the deal on Wednesday, Silverman said he expected the resale craze would continue long after the recovery from the pandemic, and he thought it would be led by Depop’s “passionate community” of fashion-conscious young people. More than 90% of Depop’s 30 million users are under the age of 26, putting them in the highly sought-after smartphone addicted generation Z – the age bracket below millennials. Etsy said Depop was the 10th most visited shopping site among gen Z consumers in the US. The company, which was founded by the English-Italian entrepreneur Simon Beckerman in Milan in 2011, now has registered users in more than 150 countries. It’s 2 million active sellers sold $650m worth of second clothes and other fashion items last year, with Depop taking a $70m cut. Etsy, which was founded in 2005 and floated in 2015, has been seeking to expand its influence among a younger generation as its users are typically older: its sellers’ average age is 39. Here’s the full story: The US stock market has pushed a little higher, in a rather muted session. Traders seem to be marking time ahead of Friday’s US jobs report, which will show if hiring picked up in May after a surprise slowdown in April. The Dow Jones industrial average: up 90 points or 0.26% at 34,665 points S&amp;P 500: up 12 points or 0.3% at 4,214 Nasdaq Composite: up 37 points or 0.3% at 13,774 Fawad Razaqzada, analyst at Think Markets, says: The markets have been all over the place so far in the week, with the dollar initially falling and then rebounding, causing gold and foreign currencies to the opposite. Traders are evidently not willing or comfortable to commit to one particular direction and are quick to take profit. Overall, though, the underlying trend remains the same: bullish for stocks, gold, crude and other risk assets, and bearish for dollar. America’s housing boom may be slowing, as record high prices and low availability hits demand. US mortgage applications to purchase a home fell 3% last week, while applications to refinance a loan fell 4.6%, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported. Overall, mortgage application volume were down 4% last week, to the lowest level since February 2020. This is the second weekly fall in a row. Joel Kan, MBA’s Associate Vice President of Economic and Industry Forecasting, says: “Tight housing inventory, obstacles to a faster rate of new construction, and rapidly rising home prices continue to hold back purchase activity. US house prices surged to record highs in the months after the first lockdown eased, with the median price for a single-family home jumping by a record-breaking 16.2%. That has put prices out of reach of some families. Low supply is another problem, while the shortage of raw materials such as timber has driven up the cost of new properties, and led to delays. Shares in Etsy have risen in early trading as Wall Street reacts to the Depop deal. After initially popping 3%, they’re currently up 1.5% at around $166, a gain of $2.50. Etsy’s shares have doubled over the last year, amid the boom in fast-growing tech stocks. But they’re also down a fifth over the last three months, as investors have favoured ‘value stocks’ who benefit from the reopening after the pandemic. Etsy beat forecasts in the first quarter of the year, but also forecast slower growth for revenue and gross merchandise sales, which hit its stock. While Depop and Etsy both benefited from the move to e-commerce in the pandemic, the travel sector continues to suffer. European budget airline Wizz Air posted a €576m net loss for the last financial year today, and warned it will make another loss this year unless travel restrictions are lifted faster than planned. UK prime minister Boris Johnson has said today “the data is still ambiguous” on whether the plan to unlock the economy on June 21 can go ahead. But, Johnson also said there is “nothing in the data at the moment that means we cannot go ahead with step four”, despite the rise in cases of the Delta variant. Etsy CEO Josh Silverman has told CNBC that Depop has been growing ‘like crazy’, expanding by over 100% last year. And importantly, that’s with hardly any marketing spend, he adds, showing Depop is an “organic, authentic phenomenon” in the fast-growing “recommerce” (second-hand) market. Explaining the logic behind today’s $1.6bn deal, Silverman says: We think Depop is the most exciting company in the most exciting sector in retail right now. Resale is growing like crazy, in fact recommerce of clothing is growing 40% year-over-year, and is projected to be a $64bn market in the US alone. And the core demographic for resale is Gen-Z - these are people under 26. Silverman adds that a quarter of the global workforce right now is Gen-Z, and by 2030, they’re expected to number 1.3 billion workers. That’s four times the US population, and Depop is the choice of Gen-Z. Etsy’s acquisition of Depop shows the growing influence of clothing resale platforms, says the New York Times: More shoppers are turning to the secondhand market for something cheaper and — potentially — greener as the overproduction of clothing increasingly adds to landfill The trend appears to have been accelerated by the pandemic as more shoppers looked to declutter wardrobes, earn cash by selling their old clothes or set up fashion customization businesses from their bedrooms. Investor appetite is also on the rise. Last month, Europe’s largest secondhand fashion marketplace, Vinted, raised 250 million euros in a funding round that valued the start-up at €3.5 billion ($4.26 billion), while in the United States companies such as ThredUp and Poshmark have gone public this year. The Financial Times says the two firms hope to learn from each other: Depop is hoping to tap Etsy’s expertise in bolstering community safety and scaling internationally, while Etsy hopes to learn from Depop’s mobile expertise and social-media savvy. “Many of the challenges that we are going through as a business are things that Etsy has gone through before,” said Maria Raga, Depop’s chief executive. “Etsy has made massive improvements in terms of search and discovery, and this is something that we can definitely learn from.” CNBC has more details of the sale: Etsy expects to finalize the deal by the third quarter of 2021. Depop will remain headquartered in London, Etsy said, operating as a standalone business run by current management. The deal marks the biggest acquisition yet for Etsy, which went public on the New York Stock Exchange in 2015. Shares of Etsy have roughly doubled in the last 12 months thanks to an e-commerce boom resulting from the coronavirus pandemic. The stock is down 5% year-to-date, however. James Wise of venture capital firm Balderton Capital, which has invested in Depop since its seed round of funding, has tweeted about today’s sale to Etsy: Etsy also points out that demand for second-hand clothing is growing fast. The second-hand market is projected to grow at a 39% compound annual growth rate from 2019-2024 in the United States, reaching $64 billion, and to grow to twice the size of fast fashion on a global basis. And Depop, it says, is growing rapidly in this market: Starting first in the U.K. and moving into the U.S. and Australia, Depop now has a community of approximately 30 million registered users across nearly 150 countries. With 4 million active buyers and 2 million active sellers in 2020, we believe Depop’s cohort behavior is particularly impressive: for example, in 2020, 75% of gross merchandise sales was from existing cohorts; ~75% of sellers were also buyers; and, on average, sellers sold approximately 10 items and buyers bought approximately 6 items. British second-hand fashion app Depop is being bought by Etsy, the US e-commerce site for handmade goods and craft supplies, in a $1.6bn deal. London-based Depop’s fast-growing online marketplace allows people to buy and sell second-hand clothes, and other items, through its mobile app and website. Founded in 2011, Depop is popular with younger people - so this deal gives Etsy a more youthful demographic than millennials, Gen-Xers and older shoppers (the median age of an Etsy seller is 39, according to one survey). It also highlights the importance of the recycled clothing market. Some younger, environmentally conscious shoppers are moving away from the fast fashion approach due to the environmental damage and carbon footprint. Depop had more than four million active buyers last year, and two million active sellers. It more than doubled its gross sales last year to $650m, with revenues (mainly from commissions), also more than doubling to $70m. Famous users include pop star Lily Allen, who sells items from her wardrobe there. Etsy reports that: Approximately 90% of Depop’s active users are under the age of 26; and young consumers are adopting second-hand fashion faster than any other audience; According to Depop’s monthly brand awareness surveys, it has high prompted awareness for the Gen Z demographic within the resale sector; Depop is the 10th most visited shopping site among Gen Z consumers in the U.S. Josh Silverman, Etsy’s CEO, says Depop has ‘significant potential’ to grow:. “We are simply thrilled to be adding Depop—what we believe to be the resale home for Gen Z consumers—to the Etsy family. Depop is a vibrant, two-sided marketplace with a passionate community, a highly-differentiated offering of unique items, and we believe significant potential to further scale. Back in 2019, Depop’s CEO Maria Raga told The Observer that the company wanted to empower “young, entrepreneurial, creative people”, through the sale of ‘pre-loved’ items online. Today Raga explains: We’re on an incredible journey building Depop into a place where the next generation comes to explore unique fashion and be part of a community that’s changing the way we shop. Our community is made up of people who are creating a new fashion system by establishing new trends and making new from old. They come to Depop for the clothes, but stay for the culture. Here’s more on Depop: Despite the reopening of the UK economy in April, consumers continued to pay off their credit card bills. Bank of England figures show that households continued to pay down personal debt, with net repayments of £377m in April. Economists had expected a £500m rise in lending to consumers, as non-essential shops in England reopened and pubs and restaurants began serving outside on 12 April. This may show that people have been digging into their savings to fuel the 9.2% surge in retail sales across Great Britain in April, Thomas Pugh of Capital Economics explains: The reopening of non-essential shops on 12th April wasn’t enough to tempt consumers into digging out their credit cards. But the partial reopening of hospitality businesses in May means that consumer credit probably rose last month. And we are still happy with our forecast of a 6% q/q rise in consumer spending in Q2. Consumers paid back another £0.4bn of consumer credit in April, the eighth consecutive monthly fall. However, the amount of cash in households’ bank accounts only rose by £10.7bn, compared to an average monthly rise of £17.6bn in the previous three months. This suggests that consumers paid for the 9.2% m/m rise in retail sales in April out of their incomes and the large stock of savings, rather than dusting off their credit cards. More from trade expert David Henig about the limited benefits of the UK joining the trans-Pacific trade pact. Demand for UK properties picked up in April, after the stamp duty holiday was extended in March to the end of June. The Bank of England reports that mortgage approvals rose in April, higher than economists expected, and remained ‘relatively strong’: Approvals for house purchase ticked up in April, to 86,900, from 83,400 in March. They have fallen from a recent peak of 103,400 in November, but have remained relatively strong. The BoE also reports that net mortgage lending by British lenders slumped to £3.3bn in April. That’s down from the record £11.5bn borrowed the previous month in the race to seal deals before the original tax freeze deadline at the end of March. That’s also below the £5.7bn average in the six months to February 2021. The Bank says this fall is due to the government’s original plan to end the tax break, on transactions up to £500,000, on March 31st. Despite weaker net lending, both gross lending and repayments remain above levels seen since the start of 2020. The recent variability is likely to reflect the reduction in the stamp duty tax, which was initially expected to end in March, but has now been extended to the end of June. Chancellor Rishi Sunak extended the stamp duty holiday in March’s budget, but this move came too late too boost borrowing in April (given the time it takes to agree a sale) Yesterday we learned that house price inflation jumped to almost 11% in May, with the pandemic driving demand for larger, more rural properties. The oil price is picking up again today, after the Opec+ group agreed yesterday to keep easing supply curbs slowly. Brent crude is up 1% at $71 per barrel (towards the three-month high of $71.34 hit yesterday), after Opec ministers and key allies including Russia stuck to their policy of gradual supply increases up to July. Shares in oil companies are higher too, with BP and Royal Dutch Shell both gaining 1%. Opec+ postponed any decisions about future production until the next meeting in early July, when they should know whether sanctions on Iranian crude are lifted. Marios Hadjikyriacos, analyst at XM, expains: At that point the OPEC+ alliance will have more clarity around the demand side of the equation, and more crucially, whether there’s a breakthrough in the US-Iran nuclear negotiations that ultimately brings an overflow of lost supply back online. Oil’s fortunes now hang on diplomatic forces. If there is a deal with Iran, prices will likely suffer a deep correction but perhaps not a trend reversal. OPEC could help balance things out by slowing its own production increases to prevent Iranian barrels from flooding the market. Demand is recovering quickly, so some targeted production increases can probably be absorbed. Back in the UK, lockdown reading has helped the Harry Potter publisher Bloomsbury to its third profit upgrade of the year after a 22% surge in annual pre-tax profits. The company said people had “rediscovered the joy of reading” during the coronavirus pandemic, pushing its sales 14% higher to £185m in the 12 months to the end of February. Bloomsbury performed significantly better than the wider UK publishing market, which recorded a 2% rise in sales during 2020, according to data from the Publishers Association. The company said fantasy, escapism, social inclusion and cookery all sold well during the pandemic. New bestsellers included two books by the American fantasy author Sarah J Maas about female warriors, including A Court of Silver Flames, as well as the fantasy novel Piranesi by the British author Susanna Clarke. Other bestsellers included Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People About Race by Reni Eddo-Lodge, and Humankind by Rutger Bregman. The Harry Potter books by JK Rowling continue to attract new readers, almost a quarter of a century after their first publication. Bloomsbury said sales of the series about the boy wizard rose 7% during the past year. Here’s the full story: Here’s trade expert David Henig of the European Centre For International Political Economy on CPTPP: The Institute for Government have a very useful guide to the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership on their website, which was updated in February after the UK applied to join. It explains that membership shouldn’t significantly clash with the UK’s Brexit trade deal (as many CPTPP members already have their own agreements with the EU). But is also warned that the benefits of membership are unlikely in any significant way to make up for the economic losses of Brexit. That’s partly because the UK has already rolled over its free trade agreements (FTAs) with some members. It signed a free trade deal with Japan last year, and will probably have signed bilateral deals with Australia and New Zealand well before joining CPTPP. [On Australia, some UK farmers fear a zero-tariff and zero-quota trade deal would drive them out of business, if it leads to a surge of Australian beef imports]. Plus, there’s concern that negotiators may agree to controversial secret courts where businesses could seek compensation if their profits are hit by government policies] So, the Institute for Government argued, the benefits of the UK joining CPTPP could be limited to: FTAs with Malaysia and Brunei more ambitious text than is found in some of the rolled-over FTAs on issues such as digital services and data flows the ability to operate under a single set of rules of origin. It added: While these benefits are not negligible, they are unlikely in any significant way to make up for the economic losses arising from the UK leaving the EU. The single set of rules of origin would mean that a product could contain parts from any CPTPP country and still qualify for preferential treatment. EG, cars made in the UK could use more Pacific nation car parts, such as Japanese batteries. If a good has to have at least 70% ‘CPTPP content’ to qualify for preferential tariffs, for instance, that 70% can come from any combination of CPTPP countries. The Institute for Government explainer also outlines how the rights and obligations under the CPTPP fall into two categories: Rules: for example, on how countries should make new food safety regulations or whether they can ban the transfer of data to other CPTPP members. These are the same for all CPTPP parties (including any new members that may join). Market access: how far each CPTPP member will cut its tariffs, open up its services markets, liberalise visa conditions for business travellers, and so on. Each member has its own schedules of commitments. In some cases the commitments are offered to all other members, while in others they are restricted to specific negotiating partners. And on tariffs, they added: The CPTPP provides for almost complete liberalisation of tariffs among the participants. Tariffs are retained in only a few highly sensitive areas – for example, Japan keeps tariffs on rice, while Canada’s dairy industry is also protected. The full explainer is here: Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) The trade benefits for the UK joining CPTPP will be ‘small’, warns Robert Ward of The International Institute for Strategic Studies. Instead, he thinks the important point is CPTPP’s statement that UK membership would send “a strong signal” to other countries of the importance of free, fair, open, effective, inclusive and rules-based trade (see opening post). Trade tensions have been heightened in recent years, particularly with the bitter US-China trade war. Relations between Canberra and Beijing have also deteriorated, with China imposing tariffs and restricting imports of Australian products such as barley, wine and beef in a deepening row over alleged dumping. New Zealand’s trade and export growth minister, Damien O’Connor, says an Accession Working Group will be set up to begin the accession process with the UK. This group will examine how the UK will comply with the existing CPTPP rules and will negotiate the UK’s market access commitments. Under CPTPP accession procedures, candidates are expected to deliver the highest standard of market access commitments, including on goods, services and temporary entry for business people, O’Connor explains in a statement welcoming the move. “We look forward to working with our CPTPP partners and the UK to establish how the UK will meet the high standards required in the CPTPP, including those relating to market access. “It will be particularly important that this first accession process sets a strong precedent, both in regard to the substantive commitments expected of the UK, as well as in the adoption of a thorough and robust process.” The UK government have welcomed the invitation to begin negotiations to join CPTPP. International Trade Secretary Liz Truss said: CPTTP membership is a huge opportunity for Britain. It will help shift our economic centre of gravity away from Europe towards faster-growing parts of the world, and deepen our access to massive consumer markets in the Asia Pacific. We would get all the benefits of joining a high standards free trade area, but without having to cede control of our borders, money or laws. The Department for International Trade adds that CPTPP countries made up £110bn of UK trade in 2019 and its rules remove tariffs on 95% of goods traded between members. But as this map shows, its Pacific Rim members are rather a long way from the UK, rather than the geographical proximity of the EU.... Secretary of State for International Trade Liz Truss says it’s “excellent news” that negotiations to join CPTPP can begin. The government will present its plans to Parliament “in the coming weeks” before negotiations start, she adds. Australia’s trade minister Dan Tehan has tweeted a picture of today’s virtual meeting where the CPTPP agreed to start accession talks with the UK. He adds that “the economic and strategic heft” of the partnership would be strengthened by “high quality, high ambition economies” joining. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The UK has moved a step closer to joining a major Pacific regional trade bloc as it tries to forge closer trade links with the Asia-Pacific region after its exit from the European Union. Earlier today, the 11 members of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, or CPTPP, agreed to start negotiations for Britain’s entry into the regional free trade agreement. Yasutoshi Nishimura, Japan’s minister in charge of TPP negotiations, told reporters that a virtual meeting of the TPP Commission agreed to allow the U.K. to begin the process to join. Bloomberg calls it a “potential boost for the country’s trade following Brexit”, adding: Yasutoshi Nishimura said the move would strengthen economic ties between the U.K. and Japan, as well as making the zone covered by the deal equal to the EU in terms of economic size. He spoke to reporters after hosting an online meeting of ministers and officials from the 11 countries who make up the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership. “The commencement of an accession process with the United Kingdom and the potential expansion of the CPTPP will send a strong signal to our trading partners around the world of our commitment to support a free, fair, open, effective, inclusive and rules-based trading system,” the ministers said in a joint statement. CPTPP consists of Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam -- and was created after president Donald Trump withdrew the US from the Trans-Pacific partnership. Britain filed a request to join CPTPP at the start of February, saying it hoped to build deeper ties with emerging economies in the Pacific. At the time, International Trade Secretary Liz Truss said membership would mean lower tariffs for car manufacturers and whisky producers, and better access for services providers, boosting employment and prosperity. As the UK’s trade in goods with EU countries fell by 23 per cent in the first quarter of the year, compared with pre-pandemic levels, there is pressure to strike trade deals elsewhere. The CPTPP removes 95% of tariffs between its members, but does not create a single market or a customs union, and it does not seek wider political integration. Becoming a member would accelerate the U.K.’s growth in export trade with faster-expanding Asian economies, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Mike Dennis. The U.K. recorded a trade surplus with CPTPP countries in the first quarter of 2021, he added. But while joining CPTPP would mean lower tariffs, concerns have been raised about the move. Back in April, the UK Labour party warned that it could end up being a trade deal with China “by the back door”, as Beijing has signalled that it is seriously considering an application, which the UK might not be able to veto if it joined. Shadow international trade secretary Emily Thornberry also warned that the UK could end up “as a rule-taker in the CPTPP rather than a rule-maker,” as New Zealand recently launched a public consultation on new accessions to the CPTPP, which said that new members will need to comply with the existing agreement. More here: Liz Truss urged to reconsider trans-Pacific free trade pact The moves comes as the global economy tries to recover from the shock of the pandemic, with world manufacturing growth hitting an 11-year high last month. That lifted recovery hopes, lifting world and European stock markets to record highs yesterday. The UK’s FTSE 100 reached a three-week high, led by commodity stocks. In another boost, Australia’s economy has returned to its pre-pandemic size, after growing 1.8% over the first three months of the year and 1.1% over the past 12 months. Markets have opened higher this morning, with the FTSE 100 up another 25 points or 0.35% at 7105 points.

To do so would be to question their school, the SQA and the government that set the process. </p> <p>They would risk being downgraded if they speak up. No allowance will be given for personal circumstances faced by pupils. </p> <p>We know that the most disadvantaged young people have been worst affected.

“pitiful” and a fraction of that committed by other countries to help children’s education, a school leaders’ union has said.</p> <p>Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School

£1,600 per head, per young person, or the Netherlands, £2,500 per head. So what is it about those children in the Netherlands or the USA that makes them worth more than our government seems to say? It’s time to stop the rhetoric I think and start the action on behalf of children and young people.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\"

only choose to continue with industrial action when there are zero Covid cases at DVLA, but they are also specifically targeting areas of the organisation that will have the greatest negative impact on the public, including some of the more vulnerable people in society, just as restrictions are starting to ease.</p> <p>The DVLA has worked closely with Public Health Wales along with Swansea environmental health and the Health and Safety Executive who have conducted regular site visits and inspections and have repeatedly confirmed a high level of compliance with control measures.</p> <p>Millions of people right across the UK are relying on essential DVLA services and PCS’s demands will cause significant and unnecessary disruption to families and businesses, all at a time when they

Pupils will be offered an extra 100m hours of tuition under post-pandemic catch-up plans unveiled today – but the government faced immediate criticism of the £1.4bn programme, with its own tsar warning “more will be needed”. The £1.4bn announced for the catch-up programme for pupils in England is “pitiful”, a school leaders’ union has said. Gavin Williamson suggested more money will be “required” as the government tackles lost pupil learning during the pandemic. A total of 107 deaths registered in England and Wales in the week ending 21 May mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate, according to the Office for National Statistics – the lowest number since the week ending September 11 2020. The prospect of care home workers being required to get vaccinated against Covid-19 has moved a step closer, with a crucial endorsement from the UK’s human rights watchdog. The proportion of deaths involving coronavirus in England and Wales is at its lowest level for more than eight months, figures show. Boris Johnson has said there is still “nothing in the data at the moment that means we cannot go ahead with step four” of lifting coronavirus restrictions. Testing for Covid-19 will be stepped up in Blackburn with Darwen as health chiefs hope to control its rising infection rates “in the next week or so”, reports PA. Half a billion doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine have been released for supply globally, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said. The government has started commercial negotiations with AstraZeneca to secure a “variant vaccine” adapted to tackle the variant first identified in South Africa, Matt Hancock said. The government said a further 12 people had died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19 as of Wednesday, bringing the UK total to 127,794. We are closing this blog now.

Several Greek islands, Malta and parts of the Caribbean could be added to the green travel list on Thursday, according to an industry expert. Paul Charles, chief executive of travel consultancy The PC Agency, said a number of popular holiday destinations “really deserve” to be moved to the low-risk tier. Holidaymakers returning to the UK from green locations are not required to self-isolate, and only need to take one post-arrival coronavirus test. Charles told the PA news agency he expects additions to the list to include the Greek islands of Zante, Rhodes and Kos, the Caribbean islands of Grenada and Antigua, plus Malta and Finland. The transition of those locations to green status would be “a boost” to the struggling travel industry, he said. We need to see the government widening the number of green destinations to help the sector recover and to help protect jobs and livelihoods, which the prime minister promised. It would be a boost to see those added. I still think we’re going to get the majority of European countries added at the end of June, but it would be an encouraging step forward. Assessments are based on a range of factors, including the proportion of a population that has been vaccinated, rates of infection, emerging new variants, and access to reliable scientific data and genomic sequencing. Portugal is the only viable major tourist destination currently on the green list. Charles said he would be “surprised” if Spain’s Balearic Islands – including Ibiza, Majorca and Menorca – are added in Thursday’s update. “They’re hugely popular and I’m not sure the government is ready to encourage so much travel at the moment.” He also warned that Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia and Indonesia could be added to the red list, which means people returning to the UK are required to spend 11 nights in a quarantine hotel. He said: There are clearly signs of increased infection in many parts of Asia at the moment and I think the government will be keen to clamp down on those as soon as they can. Travellers returning to the UK from an amber list location – which includes popular hotspots such as Spain, France, Italy and Greece – must quarantine at home for 10 days and take two post-arrival tests. The Government has urged people against non-essential travel to amber countries. Boris Johnson said the Government will “wait and see” what the recommendations of the Joint Biosecurity Centre are before announcing changes to the travel lists. He went on: We are going to try and allow people to travel as I know many people want to, but we’ve got to be cautious. We’ve got to continue to put countries on the red list, on the amber list, when that is necessary. We will have no hesitation in moving countries from the green list to the amber list to the red list if we have to do so. The priority is to continue the vaccine rollout to protect the people of this country. Boris Johnson has said there are currently no clear signals that he needs to scrap or delay plans to lift all legal restrictions on social contact in England in a matter of weeks, but he admitted that data on how effective vaccines will be at preventing a third wave was ambiguous. Despite calls from some scientists for the government to push back the planned final stage of unlocking on 21 June, the prime minister suggested he saw no reason yet to deviate from the roadmap. He did, however, urge people to remain “so cautious” because the infection rate was rising again. He said ministers had known that the number of cases would start to increase again after significant freedoms were restored on 17 May, allowing people to gather in groups of six or two households indoors and up to 30 outdoors. Speaking during a visit to a school on Wednesday – his first public appearance since marrying Carrie Johnson over the weekend – Johnson said scientists needed “a little bit longer” to figure out just how much protection the vaccines were providing against a new surge. He said: There, I’m afraid, the data is just still ambiguous. So every day we’re having long sessions, interrogating all the data, looking at all the various models. And the best the scientists can say at the moment in their guidance to us is that we just need to give it a little bit longer. I’m sorry that’s frustrating for people. I know that people want a clear answer about the way ahead for 21 June, but at the moment we’ve just got to wait a little bit longer. Read the full story here: The government said a further 12 people had died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19 as of Wednesday, bringing the UK total to 127,794. The government also said that, as of 9am on Wednesday, there had been a further 4,330 lab-confirmed cases in the UK. Separate figures published by the Office for National Statistics show there have now been 153,000 deaths registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate, PA news reports. Last month, the Guardian reported that Scotland’s incoming education secretary was being urged to take immediate action over so-called “ghost exams” – where pupils face high-stakes testing up to three times a day with none of the usual support – as high school assessments fell into chaos for the second year running. Although teachers were told to use their professional judgment to assess the grades their pupils should receive, Scotland’s exam board, the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA), has asked for evidence to support these estimates and issued question papers that must be answered “under closed-book conditions” – while insisting that these do not amount to exams. Shirley-Anne Somerville, who is now in post as Scottish education secretary, said she took “very seriously” the anxiety and concern raised by young people, parents and teachers about the model being used, but insisted it was “the fairest possible”. Critics in the sector reacted angrily, in particular because there seems to be no consideration given to individual circumstances, in particular after last year’s model was found to actively discriminate against poorer children, resulting in a government u-turn over grading. Scottish Labour said that her statement failed to answer the key questions on pupil support, new evidence and, crucially, any avenue to have personal circumstances taken into account. Scottish Labour’s education spokesperson, Michael Marra, said: At the centre of this are individual pupils left on their own to decide whether to contest the grades given to them. To do so would be to question their school, the SQA and the government that set the process. They would risk being downgraded if they speak up. No allowance will be given for personal circumstances faced by pupils. We know that the most disadvantaged young people have been worst affected. They are also those most likely to require the support of their school rather than disputing the school’s conclusions. Read our previous story on this here: The Green party has named a rugby league international as its candidate in the Batley and Spen byelection on 1 July. Ross Peltier, 29, plays for the Doncaster Dons and has represented the Jamaica international team nine times. Peltier, who lives in the constituency in what he describes as a “humble terrace house”, said he had a “profile of sorts in an area which holds rugby league as its beating heart”. “I feel I can bridge the gap with the working person who has been a single party voter all his life to the Green party,” he added. Batley and Spen is currently held by Labour, who have selected Kim Leadbeater, the sister of the area’s former MP Jo Cox. Tracy Brabin, who succeeded Cox after she was killed in 2016, was re-elected with a slim majority of 3,525 votes in 2019 and won the West Yorkshire mayoralty last month. The Greens came fifth in the 2019 election, with 1.3% of the vote. George Galloway, former MP for Bradford West and Bethnal Green and Bow, announced last week that he intends to stand with the Workers Party of Britain, stating his aim was to oust Keir Starmer as Labour leader. The Conservatives have selected Leeds councillor Ryan Stephenson as their candidate, the Yorkshire party has chosen local engineer Corey Robinson and the Lib Dems, who came fourth at the last election, have selected TV producer Jo Conchie. Paul Halloran, an independent candidate who came third with 6,432 votes in 2019, has not yet confirmed whether he is standing. Last week he posted a photo of himself with actor Laurence Fox, who received 1.88% of the vote in London’s mayoral race. A group of police officers are being investigated by their force after being found at a party in contravention of Covid-19 rules. Police were called to the gathering at a property in Hove, East Sussex, on 15 May, where the off-duty officers were found inside, PA news reports. A spokeswoman for Sussex police said: Police officers were called to an address in Hove, following reports of a gathering inside on Saturday May 15 at 8.46pm. They entered and found a number of off-duty officers present. This incident, in breach of current lockdown restrictions, is being investigated by the force’s professional standards department. Chief Superintendent Nick May said: We take Covid-related breaches very seriously and we are actively investigating this matter. The officers involved have not been suspended while the investigation continues. Matt Hancock said it was important to analyse the effects of the vaccine on cases of coronavirus and hospital admissions. The health secretary said at the press conference at the Jenner Institute in Oxford: What really matters and is hardest to judge right now is how much the vaccine has severed that link. I know that everyone was so glad about the data published yesterday, we had the first day in which no deaths were reported, but what the vaccine does is sever that link. That is its primary, not its only, but its primary job, and we watch that incredibly carefully. We know the vaccines work, the question is the degree to which they work and making sure we keep cases low enough so we can minimise hospitalisations as set out in the road map. We are vigilant and we look at it all the time. Asked by PA Media whether vaccine passport plans for mass gatherings were being scrapped, Matt Hancock said: One of the parts of step four is to set out four reviews, one of those is into certification. Being able to certify that you’ve had a vaccine is going to be necessary for international travel because some countries have already set out that they require proof that you’ve been vaccinated, and that means being able to prove with authority that you’ve had one of the jabs and confidence in which jab accepted for that proof – which is a matter for each individual country. We’ve provided the ability to show that through the NHS app, so we’re putting that certification in place where we know it will be needed. When it comes to using certification for domestic purposes, that is the review that Michael Gove is leading, and we’ll come forward with the conclusions of it soon. Asked if the government was considering keeping some restrictions such as mask wearing and work-from-home guidance after 21 June, Matt Hancock said further decisions would be made in the coming weeks. He told a press conference at the Jenner Institute in Oxford: There is nothing in the data to suggest we are definitively off track but it is too early to make the decision about June 21, step four in the road map. We’ll make that decision based on more data in the next week to 10 days, ahead of June 14, as we’ve set out. The health secretary was asked after his speech about what happened in care homes at the start of the pandemic. He said: I think the best approach is to take responsibility for all things that have happened and, as health secretary, I do that for all the decisions I have been responsible for. The vaccine programme is an incredibly important programme that we’ve learned the lessons from in the same way that we’ve learned the lessons throughout the crisis – lessons for how best to protect people and we’ve updated the rules all the way through, and we’ve been very open about that. That’s a very important part about how you handle an unprecedented situation. The government has started commercial negotiations with AstraZeneca to secure a “variant vaccine” adapted to tackle the variant first identified in South Africa, Matt Hancock said. In a speech delivered at the Jenner Institute in Oxford, he said: There is yet more to do, the work isn’t over yet – we’re still procuring all the time and planning what we need to keep this country safe, including new vaccines specifically targeted at variants of concern. I can tell you today that we’ve started commercial negotiations with AstraZeneca to secure a variant vaccine – future supplies of the Oxford /AstraZeneca vaccine that have been adapted to tackle the B.1.351 variant first identified in South Africa. Once again, we’re leading the way and backing projects with potential, so we can keep our vaccination programme one step ahead of the virus and protect the progress that we’ve all made. Matt Hancock made a thinly-veiled dig at the SNP who want to break Scotland away from rest of the UK. Speaking at the Jenner Institute in Oxford ahead of the G7 health ministers’ meeting, the health secretary said the union has “saved lives” when rolling out the Covid vaccine. He noted that the country is “safer” as a result of the union. He told a press conference: We negotiated and bought vaccines for the whole country, we allocated them according to need and we worked with the NHS, devolved administrations and local councils everywhere, and we called upon the logistical heft of the British Armed Forces to help get them into arms. This didn’t happen by accident. The devolved administrations are run by different political parties and although health is devolved, the virus doesn’t respect political boundaries. I was determined to overcome political differences so we could deliver for citizens across the country wherever they live. He continued: Like everyone I have come to love Zoom, but it wasn’t easy getting this UK-wide approach and right at the start last March I went to see each of the devolved leaders face to face. It was so important that we got on the same page about the importance of this project. So although life was pretty hectic, last March I took 24 hours to fly to Edinburgh, to Belfast, to Cardiff. That 24 hours has proved invaluable in strengthening those relationships and it’s one of the most useful 24 hours in the pandemic, and since then we’ve had a call every single week, the four of us, and, frankly, sometimes it’s been like group therapy. Half a billion doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine have been released for supply globally, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said. Speaking at the Jenner Institute in Oxford, he said: The Oxford vaccine, developed by brilliant science here in Oxford, linked with AstraZeneca’s industrial might, backed by the support of the UK government, together, make it available at cost, this is in my view the greatest gift that this nation could give the world during this pandemic. A vaccine that’s available at cost – with no charge but intellectual property – and that because it can be stored simply offers hope for the developing world. So, as well as the money that we’ve donated – giving half a billion pounds to Covax (the global vaccine sharing facility) – we’ve also given the world the vaccine, which makes up 96% of those Covax doses. As of today, I can confirm that over half a billion doses of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine have now been released for supply globally, the majority of them in low and middle income countries. Matt Hancock said that Britons “love queuing” and there was “nothing more upsetting than people jumping the queue”. He also also talked about how Contagion, the 2011 American thriller film about the spread of a virus, inspired him to think of how important the vaccine rollout would be and how it was designed. Speaking at the Jenner Institute in Oxford, Hancock said: We started early on how we could make access to the vaccine fair. I know that a few eyebrows were raised when I said that the film Contagion shaped my thinking about our vaccine programme – I should reassure Sir John Bell that it wasn’t my primary source of advice – but when I watched that film, a penny did drop for me: not just that the vaccine would be our way out of the pandemic, but that the power of the vaccine would be so great that we would have to think very hard about who to protect and in what order. I knew that some of the most difficult moments of the pandemic would not be before the vaccine was approved, but afterwards when the scramble for vaccines have begun. He added: We Brits love queuing and there’s nothing more upsetting than someone jumping the queue. So, again, we started planning early to make sure that this was fair and we spent time preparing for how to organise the rollout in as fair a way as possible. The clinically advised prioritisation for getting vaccines in arms has been critical, I believe, in securing trust in the programme overall because it’s helped demonstrate that the system is fair. So, we acted early to reassure people that in the finest tradition of the values of the NHS, vaccines will be given according to need, not ability to pay – whether you’re the prime minister, or Premier League footballer or the future king of England. You have to wait your turn, just like everyone else. Speaking at the Jenner Institute in Oxford ahead of the G7 health ministers’ meeting, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said he had been told it would take at least five years to develop a coronavirus vaccine at the start of the pandemic. I specifically remember a then meek and timid professor turning to me when I asked how fast this could possibly be done. He said that if everything went right then the very best we could hope for would be 12 to 18 months. Who would have thought that just 11 months later we’d be the first country in the world with a clinically authorised vaccine and that professor Jonathan Van-Tam would be turning down Strictly. He also called Chris Whitty a “vaccine hero” in the speech. Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, has described the latest milestones in the vaccination rollout as an “incredible achievement”, with three-quarters of adults in the UK having received a first dose and 50% of adults in England having been given both jabs. He added: We know vaccines are breaking the chain between infection rates, hospital admissions and death. But we also know two doses are better than one, particularly in our fight against the Delta (India) variant. So while there’s a lot to celebrate, we’ve still got a way to go before people have had both jabs. We also know it takes three weeks for doses to be fully effective. We urge everyone to get their jabs when they’re offered them. A total of 39,585,665 first doses of the Covid-19 vaccines have now been delivered since the vaccination roll-out began almost six months ago. This is the equivalent of 75.2% of all people aged 18 and over, meaning three-quarters of adults in the UK are estimated to have received their first dose, PA Media reports. In Wales, 2,152,709 first doses have been given, the equivalent of 85.3% of the adult population. This is well ahead of the other three nations of the UK, with England on 74.7% (33,085,145 first doses), Scotland on 74.1% (3,286,261 first doses) and Northern Ireland on 73.1% (1,061,550 first doses). The latest figures have been published by the UK’s four health agencies. They also show that an estimated 49.5% of UK adults are now fully vaccinated against Covid-19, including half (50.0%) of adults in England. In Scotland 47.5% of adults are estimated to have received both doses, along with 46.5% in Northern Ireland and 45.1% in Wales. Boris Johnson said the government will have “no hesitation” in moving countries around the red, amber and green lists of travel restrictions. Asked whether there may be more countries added to the green list soon, where there are no requirements to quarantine on returning to the UK, the prime minister said: You’ve got to wait and see what the Joint Biosecurity Centre say and what the recommendations are about travel. We’re going to try ... to allow people to travel, as I know that many people want to, but we’ve got to be cautious and we’ve got to continue to put countries on the red list, on the amber list, when that is necessary. I want you to know we will have no hesitation in moving countries from the green list to the amber list to the red list, if we have to do so. The priority is to continue the vaccine rollout, to protect the people of this country. Three-quarters of adults in the UK are estimated to have received a first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, health agency figures show. UK Covid vaccine confidence has been “sky high” in Britain, according to the health secretary, Matt Hancock. Addressing the first ever Global Vaccine Confidence Summit, Hancock said: “Across the UK confidence in the vaccine programme has been sky high. “We continue to top the list of places where people are willing to take, or have taken, a Covid vaccine – around nine in 10 of us.” He added: “I am aware that this isn’t a vaccine world cup – different nations don’t compete for one prize, we know that when everyone is safe we’re all going to be the winners.” Hancock added that when vaccine confidence in one country “takes a hit” then “word can spread, fake news travels fast”. “Vaccine confidence is an international challenge and one that takes international action,” he added. “The speed of misinformation is a deadly threat.” Testing for Covid-19 will be stepped up in Blackburn with Darwen as health chiefs hope to control its rising infection rates “in the next week or so”, reports PA. The east Lancashire borough has recently overtaken Bolton as England’s top Covid hotspot area as cases rise in parts of the north-west region amid concerns over the spread of the Indian variant. The rate in Blackburn with Darwen stands at 436.2 cases per 100,000 people, with 653 new cases in the seven days to 28 May. This is up from 303.3 in the seven days to 21 May. People without symptoms who live, work or study in areas with BB1 and BB2 postcodes in Blackburn with Darwen are asked to take a Covid PCR test at any of its five new mobile testing units. Surge testing teams from the council are also knocking on doors in some areas of Blackburn to hand out PCR test kits, with staff returning later to collect. The borough’s director of public health, Prof Dominic Harrison, said: “We think that Blackburn with Darwen is around seven to 10 days behind Bolton in terms of rising rates, so it’s encouraging to see their infection rate starting to decline. With all of the engagement work and surge testing that we are doing in the areas of Blackburn where we first identified cases of the variant of concern, we are hopeful that in the next week or so we can take control of our case rates too.” However, the Blackburn MP Kate Hollern has called on the government to provide the increased numbers of doses required to halt the spread among 17 and 18-year-olds. Luke Sibieta, a research fellow at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, has criticised the government’s commitment to school catch-up funding, saying other countries were being “much more ambitious” than the UK. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Sibieta said: The £1.4bn announced today adds to the £1.7bn that has already been announced, making for a total of about £3.1bn on education catch-up. A lot of that now is focused on the national tutoring programme, which (Sir) Kevan Collins talked about as being quite an important part of education recovery but it is clearly a lot less than the £10-15 billion that Collins was proposing for a full-scale education recovery, which would incorporate much bigger elements. The Biden administration in the US has proposed about £1.22bn – about £1,600 per pupil, over five times more than we’re spending in the UK. The Netherlands is going even further and has allocated over €8bn, which amounts to over £2,500 per pupil, so there are countries around the world going much further and being much more ambitious.” Boris Johnson has said there is still “nothing in the data at the moment that means we cannot go ahead with step four” of lifting coronavirus restrictions. “But we’ve got to be so cautious,” the prime minister added, as he said infection rates were increasing. “We always knew that was going to happen,” he said, adding: “What we need to work out is to what extent the vaccination programme has protected enough of us, particularly the elderly and vulnerable, against a new surge, and there I’m afraid the data is still ambiguous. “The best the scientists can say at the moment is we just need to give it a little bit longer.” Lockdown reading has helped the Harry Potter publisher, Bloomsbury, to its third profit upgrade of the year after a 22% surge in annual pre-tax profits. The company said people had “rediscovered the joy of reading” during the coronavirus pandemic, pushing its sales 14% higher to £185m in the 12 months to the end of February. Bloomsbury performed significantly better than the wider UK publishing market, which recorded a 2% rise in sales during 2020, according to data from the Publishers Association. The company said fantasy, escapism, social inclusion and cookery all sold well during the pandemic. New bestsellers included two books by the American fantasy author Sarah J Maas about female warriors, including A Court of Silver Flames, as well as the fantasy novel Piranesi by the British author Susanna Clarke. Other bestsellers included Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People About Race by Reni Eddo-Lodge, and Humankind by Rutger Bregman. The Harry Potter books by JK Rowling continue to attract new readers, almost a quarter of a century after their first publication. Bloomsbury said sales of the series about the boy wizard rose 7% during the past year. The pandemic reignited many people’s interest in reading, said Bloomsbury’s chief executive, Nigel Newton, and he expects this to continue even as lockdown restrictions ease. He said in an interview on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: People have developed a new habit and one where they have rediscovered the joy of reading, and will cling on to that even as the clamour of other ways of spending their time re-emerge. Read more here: Airlines are overlooking the mental health and wellbeing of pilots and other aviation workers in their scramble to get planes flying again, according to researchers. Many aviation workers experienced anxiety, stress and depression during Covid-19 lockdowns, but they report feeling discouraged from acknowledging problems or seeking help, creating potential safety hazards and health problems. The warning this week from the Lived Experience and Wellbeing Project – a Trinity College Dublin hub that studies aviation worker wellbeing and the impact on performance and flight safety – came as airlines across the world increase flights and start rehiring pilots and crew. A total of 1,841 flights were scheduled from UK airports to France, Spain, Italy and Greece for the two weeks from 17 May, a rise of more than 300% compared with the previous fortnight. Airlines in the US inaugurated hundreds of new routes last week. Aviation workers will welcome the chance to regain their salaries and reboot their careers, but survey data suggests many will feel depleted as they return to cockpits and cabins, said Paul Cullen, a commercial airline pilot and research associate with the Trinity College team. We can’t sweep this under the carpet or dress it up. The data says a certain number of pilots were struggling pre-Covid but they wouldn’t disclose a mental health issue to their employer because of the stigma and fear of losing their license and perhaps losing their salary. Just as airlines have procedures to ensure mothballed planes are airworthy, humans need attention too, said Cullen. “You need to do the same for the crew to make sure they’re airworthy.” Read the full story here: The Northern Ireland Public Prosecution Service has announced that no prosecutions are to be taken against Black Lives Matter demonstrators who participated in protests in the region when strict Covid-19 rules on public gatherings were in place. The prosecution service said it had decided not to prosecute 14 suspects reported for potential offences under Stormont’s coronavirus regulations, PA Media reports. The decisions relate to three protests last summer – two in Belfast and one in Derry. Prosecutors concluded that the test for prosecution was not met because the suspects would have been able to successfully argue a defence of reasonable excuse. Debate is continuing over whether the final stages of unlocking restrictions in England can go ahead on 21 June due to concerns over the spread of the Delta variant first identified in India. Downing Street has indicated that Boris Johnson still sees nothing in the data to suggest the plan will need to be delayed. A No 10 spokesman said: The prime minister has said on a number of occasions that we haven’t seen anything in the data but we will continue to look at the data, we will continue to look at the latest scientific evidence as we move through June towards June 21. Tuesday’s zero death tally is likely to feed into ministers’ considerations. They will also consider that the figure followed a bank holiday weekend, so there may be a delay in reporting of deaths. The NHS Confederation said the ONS figures, which show a 29% fall in coronavirus deaths from the previous week, were reassuring but “the race is not yet won”. Director of policy Dr Layla McCay said: Given predictions of a summer wave of infections, the government must now use all available data to consider carefully whether 21 June is the right date for lifting all restrictions. It is of real concern that cases are climbing quickly, and our members are increasingly worried that this will lead to more hospital admissions. The vaccination programme in England will be extended to all adults within weeks, while all those aged 18 and over in Wales and Northern Ireland are able to book their jabs. In Scotland over-18s are being invited to pre-register for a jab with appointments starting in mid-June. The UK as a whole is expected to hit another milestone of three-quarters of the adult population receiving their first Covid jab. Latest government data suggests more than 39.4 million people had received their first dose, equating to 74.9% of adults. Sir John Bell, regius professor of medicine at Oxford University, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that current figures “don’t look too intimidating” but they still need to “play out for a couple of weeks” before the government makes its final decision on whether the 21 June reopening can go ahead. He said: I think the gain now is, can we get more people vaccinated down into younger, younger age groups to try and stop more transmission. In Scotland, the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, paused plans to ease restrictions in much of the country. She announced on Tuesday that while parts of the country will move to Level 1 of the Scottish government’s restrictions from Saturday, much of the central belt including Edinburgh, Dundee and Glasgow will be kept in Level 2. Sturgeon said the country was still at a “delicate and fragile point” in the battle with the virus, in an announcement on restrictions which she described as a “mixed bag”. Scotland’s clinical director, Prof Jason Leitch, warned the Delta variant “is causing us some challenge and is spreading quicker than we hoped”. The £1.4bn announced for the post-pandemic catch-up programme for pupils in England is “pitiful” and a fraction of that committed by other countries to help children’s education, a school leaders’ union has said. Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, hit out at the government on Wednesday as it faced scrutiny over why the money is about a 10th of the £15bn total understood to have been recommended by the education recovery commissioner, Sir Kevan Collins. Barton said the government package was “dispiriting” and accused the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, of having lower ambitions for children than those of his union’s members. “It’s pretty pitiful, only yesterday we were hearing stories about extending the school day and even if some people disagreed with it, at least there was a sense of ‘let’s do something radical, let’s do something different’,” he told Sky News. “Today’s announcement essentially equates to £50 per head: you compare that with the USA which is putting £1,600 per head, per young person, or the Netherlands, £2,500 per head. So what is it about those children in the Netherlands or the USA that makes them worth more than our government seems to say? It’s time to stop the rhetoric I think and start the action on behalf of children and young people.” Read the full story here: A total of 153,229 deaths have now occurred in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate, the ONS said. The highest number of deaths to occur on a single day was 1,477 on 19 January, PA Media reports. During the first wave of the virus, the daily death toll peaked at 1,461 deaths on 8 April 2020. Hundreds of workers at the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency have launched fresh industrial action in a long-running dispute over Covid-related safety. Members of the Public and Commercial Services union at the DVLA site in Swansea went on strike on Wednesday until Saturday, PA Media reports. The union warned it was entering a new phase of “sustained and targeted” industrial unrest for months to come. The latest strike is the third time staff have walked out over demands for more safety measures. The DVLA insists it has done everything possible to keep workers safe and has followed official guidelines. The PCS general secretary, Mark Serwotka, said a deal was all but agreed to end the dispute, claiming it was suddenly withdrawn at the 11th hour without any explanation. He said: Through painstaking negotiation, our union and DVLA senior management were on the verge of agreeing a deal only for it to be scuppered at the last minute. We strongly suspect senior ministers at the Department for Transport have interfered with the progress we were making and want to make some kind of ideological stand against PCS. They have grossly underestimated the resolve of our members in DVLA and have only emboldened them to take targeted and sustained action in the months ahead until they win. PCS is fully prepared for months of strike action, and we urge the government to rethink its position. A DVLA spokesman said: It’s disappointing to see the Public and Commercial Services union not only choose to continue with industrial action when there are zero Covid cases at DVLA, but they are also specifically targeting areas of the organisation that will have the greatest negative impact on the public, including some of the more vulnerable people in society, just as restrictions are starting to ease. The DVLA has worked closely with Public Health Wales along with Swansea environmental health and the Health and Safety Executive who have conducted regular site visits and inspections and have repeatedly confirmed a high level of compliance with control measures. Millions of people right across the UK are relying on essential DVLA services and PCS’s demands will cause significant and unnecessary disruption to families and businesses, all at a time when they are most needed. During a series of interviews on Wednesday, Gavin Williamson struggled to explain the discrepancy between the announced government spending and that recommended by the education recovery commissioner, Sir Kevan Collins, who was appointed in February by Downing Street to lead efforts to make up for the damage done by the coronavirus pandemic, particularly to pupils from more deprived backgrounds. The education secretary was asked multiple times on Sky News about either the difference in the two sums or about the discussions with the Treasury about funding, and he declined to give a direct answer. The proportion of deaths involving coronavirus in England and Wales is at its lowest level for more than eight months, figures show. There were 9,860 deaths from all causes registered in the week ending 21 May, according to the Office for National Statistics. Of these, 1.1% (107 deaths) had “novel coronavirus” mentioned on the death certificate, PA news reports. The last time the proportion was so low was in the week ending 11 September, when the virus accounted for 1% of deaths. At the peak of the second wave, in the week ending 29 January, Covid-19 accounted for 45.7% of registered deaths. The latest figure is the lowest number of deaths involving coronavirus since the week ending 11 September, and a fall of 29% from the previous week. The prospect of care home workers being required to get vaccinated against Covid-19 has moved a step closer, with a crucial endorsement from the UK’s human rights watchdog. Ministers are considering changing the law to make vaccination a condition of deployment for people in some professions that come into regular close contact with elderly and vulnerable people at high risk from the coronavirus. In a report to the government seen by the Guardian, the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) said making vaccines compulsory for care home staff would be a “significant departure from current public health policy”. But it judged that ministers were “right to prioritise protection of the right to life for residents and staff” and said it would be reasonable for care home workers to need a jab “in order to work directly with older and disabled people, subject to some important safeguards”. The EHRC is also likely to make a similar recommendation about healthcare workers, after the vaccines minister, Nadhim Zahawi, suggested over the weekend that NHS staff could face mandatory jabs, too, as some patients were “being infected in hospital”. Zahawi said no decisions had been made yet, and stressed there was a precedent: surgeons were required to be vaccinated against hepatitis B. He added: It would be incumbent on any responsible government to have the debate, to do the thinking about how we go about protecting the most vulnerable by making sure that those who look after them are vaccinated. A government source said: “We think it would save lives.” Read the full story here: The shadow education secretary, Kate Green, has called for more support for extra-curricular activities in schools. Green told BBC Breakfast: What we’re proposing is that there should be a range of measures in a package of support for children and young people. Yes more time for small group tutoring and catching up on lost learning, but children can’t learn well if they’re worried, if they’re anxious, if they’re not having time to play and develop. So we’re also suggesting support for extra-curricular activities, play, drama, art and so on, and of course in putting in mental health support in schools. She added: Children need some time to relax and enjoy life, over the summer and into the new school year we think the important thing is to make sure the fabulous facilities that schools have, the sports fields, the art rooms, the music rooms and so on, can be used for out-of-school activities too. So we’re talking about school being open for longer but not for lots of extra formal learning, we don’t want children doing maths at five and six in the evening when they’re really tired. Pupils will be offered an extra 100m hours of tuition under post-pandemic catch-up plans unveiled today – but the government faced immediate criticism of the £1.4bn programme, with its own tsar warning “more will be needed”. After months of unprecedented school closures, £1.4bn will be spent on up to 6m sets of 15-hour tutoring courses for disadvantaged pupils as well as an expansion of an existing fund for helping 16- to 19-year-olds with subjects such as English and maths, the Department for Education said. There is also provision for extra training and support for teachers, and funding to allow some year 13 students to repeat their final year if it was badly affected by the pandemic. It gave no immediate verdict on mooted plans to extend school days by 30 minutes. This idea, criticised as misplaced by some teaching unions, will be the subject of a separate review due to report later in the year. On the new spending plans there was virtual unanimity from unions that the sums committed were insufficient, with the National Education Union calling them “inadequate and incomplete”. Perhaps even more damaging for ministers, the announced spend is about a 10th of the £15bn total understood to have been recommended by Sir Kevan Collins, who was appointed in February by Downing Street as the education recovery commissioner tasked with leading efforts to make up for the damage done by the coronavirus pandemic, particularly to pupils from more deprived backgrounds. Read the full story by my colleagues Peter Walker and Rachel Hall here: The £1.4bn announced for the catch-up programme for pupils in England is “pitiful”, a school leaders’ union has said. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), told Sky News: It’s pretty dispiriting, here I am as somebody who is leading a trade union, and for all my colleagues it feels this morning as if we have got higher ambitions for the nation’s children and young people than the education secretary. It’s pretty pitiful, only yesterday we were hearing stories about extending the school day and even if some people disagreed with it, at least there was a sense of ‘let’s do something radical, let’s do something different’. Today’s announcement essentially equates to 50 per head, you compare that with the USA which is putting 1,600 per head, per young person, or the Netherlands, 2,500 per head. So what is it about those children in the Netherlands or the USA that makes them worth more than our government seems to say? It’s time to stop the rhetoric I think and start the action on behalf of children and young people. A total of 107 deaths registered in England and Wales in the week ending 21 May mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate, according to the Office for National Statistics – the lowest number since the week ending September 11 2020. The figure is down 29% on the previous week. Around one in 91 (1.1%) deaths registered in the week to 21 May mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate. Education secretary Gavin Williamson said recording zero deaths from coronavirus on Tuesday was “promising” but urged the public not to be complacent. Speaking to LBC radio, he said: “It shows that the enormous sacrifices of the British people are starting to really deliver.” He said: The fact that the British people have gone out there with verve and gusto and actually got vaccinated when so many other nations have not had that same level of take-up is a real credit. It is promising what we’ve seen in terms of zero deaths but we can’t be complacent. We continue to be careful and we’ve got to make sure we continue to get vaccinated. Williamson added there was a sense in government that there had been “really promising progress” towards scrapping all restrictions on 21 June, adding: You’re right to say it is about data, not dates, but the vaccines are having an impact in terms of actually reducing transmission, reducing the number of people in hospital and it is these factors that are going to guide the decision. Cabinet minister Gavin Williamson suggested more money will be “required” as the government tackles lost pupil learning during the pandemic. Put to him that an extra £1.4bn amounted to £50 per pupil in England, the education secretary told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: It is quite unprecedented to be getting this quantum of money outside of a spending review. But what we decided we needed to do was deliver interventions and support and invest in children immediately – that’s why we’ve ... over the last few months announced a total of over £3bn in terms of targeted help for children. Asked whether the Department for Education had not announced longer learning hours – with catch-up tsar Sir Kevan Collins reportedly pushing for an additional 100 hours per pupil – due to a lack of extra funding, Williamson said: “I have no doubt that in order to deliver everything we have ambitions for, for our children, there will be more that is required.” The education secretary said he was “absolutely delighted with £1.4bn”, when asked whether he had wanted more financial investment from the Treasury for the coronavirus catch-up plans. Pressed further on LBC radio on whether he had requested an additional “£5-6bn”, Williamson said: It is incredibly tempting to get involved in divulging to you private conversations with the chancellor and the prime minister, but I’m going to possibly sidestep this one, if that’s OK?

href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/28/covid-german-children-12-16-pfizer-vaccine-next-month\">vaccinated</a> is showing no signs of letting up. </p> \n  <p>Whilst the European Medicines Agency (EMA) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/28/covid-german-children-12-16-pfizer-vaccine-next-month\">approved the use of Biontech/Pfizer in children aged 12 to 15 on Friday</a>, and the government has also given the green light for its use from 7 June, the standing committee on vaccination, Stiko, which reports to the ministry of health, has still to make its recommendation.</p> \n  <p>The chair of Stiko, Thomas Mertens, has urged people to be patient, telling a <a href=\"https://www.ndr.de/nachrichten/info/podcast4684.html\">weekly podcast </a>dedicated to coronavirus developments, now on its 91st episode, that the vaccine is “no liquorice sweet” but a medical intervention.</p> \n  <p>“The decision as to whether Stiko recommends that all children between the ages of 12 and 16 be vaccinated against coronavirus must be based only on the best available evidence basis,” he said. </p> \n  <p>He stressed however, that Stiko would recommend the use of the vaccine on children with pre-existing conditions. </p> \n  <p>Mertens said the data provided by the vaccine makers resulting from their clinical studies of the mRNA vaccine were so far insufficient to recommend its use on all children. </p> \n  <p>“The number of vaccinated children in the study is simply too small in order to be able to make a reliable statement about its safety in this age group.” </p> \n  <p>Out of 1,100 children who took part in the study, about 14 of them suffered a severe reaction. </p> \n  <p>Mertens said other factors had to be taken into account when deciding whether to recommend the jab, such as a child’s risk of getting sick without a vaccine, as well as the question of herd immunity in the wider population. </p> \n  <p>Mertens said the decision was not an easy one, despite the millions of children who have already been vaccinated in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news\">US</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel\">Israel</a>. </p> \n  <p>“It’s not like offering the children a liquorice sweet,” he said. “This is a medical intervention”. </p> \n  <p>He added it was extremely rare for children to have a severe bout of coronavirus and that also had to be part of the equation. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time

<div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/germany\">Germany</a> </strong>is slowly beginning to open up again with the government’s disease control agency, the Robert Koch Institute confirming that a third wave of the virus has been broken, and the number of new infections is lower than at any time since the autumn.</p> \n  <p>Almost a fifth of all Germans have now been fully vaccinated, and about 900,000 to 1m jabs are being administered every day.</p> \n  <p>But caution is being urged as virologists say until 70% of the population have received two jabs, the situation remains fragile.</p> \n  <p>Among the much-awaited restriction easing measures taking place in Berlin from Friday are the reopening of gyms and swimming pools as well as restaurants and bars, though establishments with service both inside and out will have to demand a negative result from customers if they wish to open both areas.</p> \n  <p>The obligation to make an appointment before going shopping, so-called “<em tabindex=\"-1\">Termin Shopping</em>”, will be dropped, though mask wearing will remain the rule, including on public transport.</p> \n  <p>Despite the fact that 500 people are now allowed to meet for cultural or sporting events in the open air, 100 inside, Stephan Hengst from the Berlin Music Commission has criticised the suddenness of the announcement, saying club operators and musicians have been given little notice to be able to organise events.</p> \n  <p>Companies must continue to allow their employees to work from home wherever possible which the German Trade Union Association, DGB, has insisted is necessary. </p> \n  <p>“As long as a majority of the population is not fully vaccinated, employers must not be allowed to shirk from their responsibilities,” the DGB’s head, Reiner Hoffmann, said.</p> \n  <p>But the head of the German Association of Employers (BDA), Steffen Kampeter, has insisted companies and employees should be relied upon to make the right decision as to whether they should return or not, with regular testing and the option to continue in home office necessary measures to help manage the coming weeks and months.</p> \n  <p>From Monday, about 6,000 company doctors are expected to boost the vaccine campaign when group prioritisation rules are lifted. </p> \n  <p>Having received an initial contingent of 700,000 doses, they have said they expect to be able to carry out around 5m vaccinations every month.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time

The government has procured around 1m doses so far for 23.5 million people, and has ordered tens of millions more – a significant proportion of which are domestically produced vaccine candidates in trial stage.</p> \n  <p>Chen told the media he hopes that once they have enough supply, they will be able to administer 1m doses per week, through Taiwan’s 300 hospitals, 800 clinics and 200 other locations.</p> \n  <p>According to local media he said any businesses with more than 1,000 employees can host a vaccination stop.</p> \n  <p>Chen said the government hopes to have 60% of the population receive at least one dose by October. It’s potentially a tall order, requiring about 14m doses.</p> \n  <p>Currently Taiwan has received 850,000 doses, a mix of AstraZeneca and Moderna.</p> \n  <p>It has ordered about 4.5m more from Moderna, 9.2m from Astrazeneca, and 4.7m via Covax, but the imminent arrival of any of these is far from confirmed given the aforementioned complications and global shortages.</p> \n  <p>Another 10m have been ordered via two Taiwan producers, but these vaccines are still in trial stage. Producers have said they intend to apply for emergency use this month – international approval likely a long way after that.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-06-02T07:15:30.300Z\">at 8.15am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-60b72a9b8f082ac930ae7a6f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-02T06:53:10.933Z\">7.53am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In the UK, Labour’s opposition spokesperson on education, Kate Green, has called for more support for extra-curricular activities in schools as part of the Covid catch-up package being proposed by the government.</p> \n  <p>She told BBC Breakfast: “What we’re proposing is that there should be a range of measures in a package of support for children and young people.<br></p> \n  <p>“Yes more time for small group tutoring and catching up on lost learning, but children can’t learn well if they’re worried, if they’re anxious, if they’re not having time to play and develop.<br></p> \n  <p>“So we’re also suggesting support for extra-curricular activities, play, drama, art and so on, and of course in putting in mental health support in schools.”<br></p> \n  <p>PA Media reports she added: “Children need some time to relax and enjoy life, over the summer and into the new school year we think the important thing is to make sure the fabulous facilities that schools have, the sports fields, the art rooms, the music rooms and so on, can be used for out-of-school activities too.<br></p> \n  <p>“So we’re talking about school being open for longer but not for lots of extra formal learning, we don’t want children doing maths at five and six in the evening when they’re really tired.”</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-06-02T07:15:59.137Z\">at 8.15am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-60b724938f082ac930ae7a2f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-02T06:44:30.321Z\">7.44am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Somewhere, someone in the UK government wrote “education” on their media grid for today, and so education minister <strong>Gavin Williamson</strong> has been sent out on the airwaves with details of plans to help pupils in the UK catch-up with schooling they may have missed during the pandemic.</p> \n  <p>He has endured quite a torrid time in a somewhat bad-tempered appearance on Sky News, where at one point he was told that the presenter hates doing shouty, repetitive interviews, but that the minister just wasn’t answering the questions.</p> \n  <p>In particular, he was pressed over the discrepancy between the money offered – £1.4bn – and the amount that catch-up tsar Sir Kevan Collins has said is needed to increase education opportunities – £15bn.</p> \n  <p>PA Media quotes Williams as saying: “It is a lot of money and it builds on £1.7bn that we’ve already committed in terms of actually delivering for children – it is an extra 100m hours of tutoring.</p> \n  <p>“It is making sure that children who need that help, who need that support, that we’re delivering that tutoring revolution to help them get it.<br></p> \n  <p>“But we recognise it is part of a process.

While the United States, Canada, and Mexico are reporting overall reductions in Covid-19 cases and deaths, new infections are increasing in the rest of the Americas, PAHO Director Carissa Etienne said. Colombia is reporting the highest rate of infections in South America, where new cases have nearly tripled in some regions, and Brazil is seeing a rise in new infections and hospitalizations, she said. But without effective leadership, Latin American countries are failing in their response to the illness. “Sadly, across our region, we’ve seen misinformation about Covid-19 sow doubt on proven health measures, often in the context of political disputes,” Etienne said in a briefing. “By stoking controversy where there is none, our leaders are sending mixed messages to the public and standing in the way of effective measures to control the virus,” she said. Of greatest concern now is Haiti, where despite sharp increases in cases, hospitalisations, and deaths, public health measures required to stop transmission are being largely ignored by the population, Etienne said. Britain is in talks with AstraZeneca for additional doses of its Covid-19 vaccine that will have been modified to better target the Beta coronavirus variant first identified in South Africa, health minister Matt Hancock said. Britain has previously secured 100 million doses of the vaccine, developed at the University of Oxford and licensed to AstraZeneca. “We’ve started commercial negotiations with AstraZeneca to secure a variant vaccine: future supplies of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine that have been adapted to tackle the B.1.351 variant first identified in South Africa,” Hancock said in a speech at the university. Italy has reported 62 coronavirus deaths and 2,897 cases, according to the latest data. The United States, Canada, and Mexico are reporting overall reductions in Covid-19 cases and deaths, though overall new infections are on the rise again in the rest of the Americas, the head of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), Carissa Etienne, said. Colombia is reporting the highest rate of infections in South America, where new cases have nearly tripled in some regions, and Brazil is seeing a rise in new infections and hospitalizations. Despite sharp increases in cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in Haiti, public health measures required to stop transmission there are being largely ignored by the population, Etienne warned. Britain reported a further 4,330 cases of coronavirus and 12 more deaths within 28 days of a positive test, according to official data. The total number of people to have received the first dose of a vaccine stood at 39,585,665, the figures showed. Japan’s prime minister announced Wednesday an additional $800m contribution to the U.N.-backed initiative to provide COVID-19 vaccines to poor countries, a four-fold increase of Japanese funding for the COVAX program. The pledge by prime minister Yoshihide Suga comes as his government attempts to accelerate vaccinations in Japan, one of the world’s least inoculated countries, only about 50 days before it hosts the Olympics amid a continuing surge in infections. He spoke as Japan co-sponsored a fundraising event for COVAX with Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which helps run the program. The program managers are seeking about $2bn more to reach a target of $8.3bn for its effort to fund free vaccines for low- and middle-income countries around the world. Global airline body IATA increased pressure on governments to ease travel restrictions on Wednesday, pointing to UK testing data that showed low incidence of Covid-19 in arriving passengers, Reuters reports. “These data tell us we can do better,” IATA Director General Willie Walsh said, citing a 2.2% positive rate among 365,895 tests carried out in February-May, according to the NHS figures. Germany plans to pay vaccine manufacturers an annual reservation fee to build up reserve capacity of around 600-700m doses per year to help it fight future pandemics, health minister Jens Spahn has said. The government plans to launch a call for tenders for so-called pandemic preparedness contracts with a five-year term so that vaccine doses “can be activated quickly if the worst comes to the worst,” Spahn told a news conference. Manufacturing setbacks and an over-reliance on EU approval for supplies slowed Germany’s rollout of Covid vaccines. It wants to boost domestic production to ensure it is not deprived of shots in future pandemics, Reuters reports. The stand-by contracts will help maintain know-how acquired during the pandemic so that next time “we don’t have to ramp up production from zero to 100,” Christoph Krupp, head of the vaccine production task force told reporters. “We want to bet on several companies and several vaccine types and not just one,” Krupp added. Reuters reports: Colombia on Wednesday began what its government called a gradual opening of its border with Venezuela after a 14-month closure intended to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Colombia, whose porous border with Venezuela extends roughly 1,380 miles (2,220km), has been the chief destination for Venezuelans fleeing their country’s social and economic crisis. The two countries do not maintain diplomatic relations. The gradual opening of river and land crossings was authorised starting at midnight on Wednesday, according to a resolution published by the Andean nation’s interior ministry. The interior ministry said biosecurity measures in light of the Covid-19 pandemic established by Colombia’s health ministry must be followed during crossings. Colombia closed its borders in March 2020. Rodrigo Duterte, president of the Philippines, has appealed to the public to get vaccinated against Covid-19, after data showed the government was far behind its immunisation targets, Reuters reports. In a televised address, Duterte said: I invite all our countrymen to be vaccinated at the earliest possible opportunity because this is the most, if not the only way, effective way, to defeat the Covid-19 pandemic. Let us all keep in mind that the vaccine will not only protect you from the virus, it will also protect your loved ones, especially the sick and elderly. John Wong, a data analyst on the government’s Covid taskforce, said that in the three months since early inoculations started, just 14% of senior citizens and 8% of people with health conditions had received first doses of a vaccine, short of the 21% target. Wong attributed the slow rollout to limited vaccine supplies, vaccine hesitancy and accessibility problems. As Reuters reports, the chairman of the Gavi vaccine alliance, Jose Manuel Barroso, has said that a pledging summit secured nearly $2.4bn, bringing total contributions nearly to $9.6bn for the Covax dose-sharing programme to buy vaccines and deliver them to poorer nations (see earlier post). Egypt aims to vaccinate 40% of its population against Covid-19 by the end of this year, the prime minister said in a televised address. By the end of Wednesday, 2.5 million people will have been vaccinated from a total of 6 million who signed up on the government’s registration platform, Reuters reported Mostafa Madbouly as saying. The first batch of locally made vaccines will be ready in July, Madbouly added. A debate over whether children in Germany should be vaccinated is showing no signs of letting up. Whilst the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved the use of Biontech/Pfizer in children aged 12 to 15 on Friday, and the government has also given the green light for its use from 7 June, the standing committee on vaccination, Stiko, which reports to the ministry of health, has still to make its recommendation. The chair of Stiko, Thomas Mertens, has urged people to be patient, telling a weekly podcast dedicated to coronavirus developments, now on its 91st episode, that the vaccine is “no liquorice sweet” but a medical intervention. “The decision as to whether Stiko recommends that all children between the ages of 12 and 16 be vaccinated against coronavirus must be based only on the best available evidence basis,” he said. He stressed however, that Stiko would recommend the use of the vaccine on children with pre-existing conditions. Mertens said the data provided by the vaccine makers resulting from their clinical studies of the mRNA vaccine were so far insufficient to recommend its use on all children. “The number of vaccinated children in the study is simply too small in order to be able to make a reliable statement about its safety in this age group.” Out of 1,100 children who took part in the study, about 14 of them suffered a severe reaction. Mertens said other factors had to be taken into account when deciding whether to recommend the jab, such as a child’s risk of getting sick without a vaccine, as well as the question of herd immunity in the wider population. Mertens said the decision was not an easy one, despite the millions of children who have already been vaccinated in the US and Israel. “It’s not like offering the children a liquorice sweet,” he said. “This is a medical intervention”. He added it was extremely rare for children to have a severe bout of coronavirus and that also had to be part of the equation. The European budget airline Wizz Air plunged to a €576m annual loss as it warned 2021 would be a “transition year” with further losses to come until travel restrictions are fully lifted. The carrier’s revenue slumped by 73% in the 12 months to the end of March, the period covering the first year of Covid-19, and it carried 10m passengers, a 75% fall compared with a year earlier. The airline said it had carried more than 830,000 passengers in May, while its planes were two-thirds full. József Váradi, the chief executive, said: We expect [this] to be a transition year where we will experience a slow but gradual recovery, mostly subject to the pace of vaccinations globally including in Europe. You can read the latest by my colleague Joanna Partridge here: Australia and European countries have announced fresh contributions to the Covax doses-sharing mechanism, in an attempt to widen vaccination of people in low and middle income countries. Australian prime minister Scott Morrison said that his country was making a further $50m donation to the Gavi vaccine alliance’s Covax facility, bringing its total to $130m. Pedro Sánchez, Spain’s prime minister, who announced a donation of 15m doses and $61m, said: “Only by leading by example we will be effective in preaching solidarity.” Sweden, Austria and Luxembourg were among other countries to also announce new donations, Reuters notes. Germany is slowly beginning to open up again with the government’s disease control agency, the Robert Koch Institute confirming that a third wave of the virus has been broken, and the number of new infections is lower than at any time since the autumn. Almost a fifth of all Germans have now been fully vaccinated, and about 900,000 to 1m jabs are being administered every day. But caution is being urged as virologists say until 70% of the population have received two jabs, the situation remains fragile. Among the much-awaited restriction easing measures taking place in Berlin from Friday are the reopening of gyms and swimming pools as well as restaurants and bars, though establishments with service both inside and out will have to demand a negative result from customers if they wish to open both areas. The obligation to make an appointment before going shopping, so-called “Termin Shopping”, will be dropped, though mask wearing will remain the rule, including on public transport. Despite the fact that 500 people are now allowed to meet for cultural or sporting events in the open air, 100 inside, Stephan Hengst from the Berlin Music Commission has criticised the suddenness of the announcement, saying club operators and musicians have been given little notice to be able to organise events. Companies must continue to allow their employees to work from home wherever possible which the German Trade Union Association, DGB, has insisted is necessary. “As long as a majority of the population is not fully vaccinated, employers must not be allowed to shirk from their responsibilities,” the DGB’s head, Reiner Hoffmann, said. But the head of the German Association of Employers (BDA), Steffen Kampeter, has insisted companies and employees should be relied upon to make the right decision as to whether they should return or not, with regular testing and the option to continue in home office necessary measures to help manage the coming weeks and months. From Monday, about 6,000 company doctors are expected to boost the vaccine campaign when group prioritisation rules are lifted. Having received an initial contingent of 700,000 doses, they have said they expect to be able to carry out around 5m vaccinations every month. EU governments have agreed to add Japan to their small list of countries from which they will allow non-essential travel, while holding off until at least mid-June for British tourists, EU sources have confirmed. Reuters reports: Ambassadors from the EU’s 27 countries approved the addition of Japan at a meeting on Wednesday, with the change to take effect in the coming days. EU countries are recommended gradually to lift travel restrictions for the current seven countries on the list- Australia, Israel, New Zealand, Rwanda, Singapore, South Korea and Thailand. Individual EU countries can still opt to demand a negative Covid-19 test or a period of quarantine. The EU last month eased criteria for adding new countries to the list, by changing to 75 from 25 the maximum number of new Covid-19 cases per 100,000 people in the previous 14 days. Britain met that revised target but was left off the list because of an increase in Covid-19 cases arising from an infectious coronavirus variant first identified in India. South Australian health authorities have warned AFL fans not to touch the ball if it flies into the crowd during Adelaide’s home game against Collingwood, sparking puns about possible “airborne transmission” of Covid. The Melbourne-based Magpies have been granted a special exemption to travel to South Australia for Saturday’s twilight clash with the Crows at Adelaide Oval, which has been operating with full-capacity crowds since early May. South Australia’s chief public health officer, Prof Nicola Spurrier, on Wednesday defended the decision to allow the team to visit despite the border being closed to Victoria amid the state’s growing Covid-19 cluster. Spurrier described the exemption as a “special situation”, saying the risk was “negligible” because the team was already in quarantine at home in Melbourne along with their families or housemates.

Its director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesuis, is speaking at the Gavi Covax summit. Vietnam’s health minister has said that Russia has agreed to provide it with 20m doses of its Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine this year, Reuters reports. The south-east Asian country approved the Russian vaccine in March but has stepped up its procurement push after being hit by its biggest outbreak so far, although its overall cases and fatality numbers remain relatively low. “Vietnam is trying to get access to Covid-19 vaccine sources to speed up its vaccination rollout at the earliest,” health minister Nguyen Thanh Long said in a statement announcing the Sputnik V agreement. At least 220 million people globally are expected to remain unemployed this year, well above pre-pandemic levels, with a weak labour market recovery exacerbating existing inequalities, the International Labour Organization (ILO) has said. The UN agency forecast the outlook improving to 205 million unemployed next year – still well above the 187 million recorded in 2019 before the onset of the pandemic, Reuters reports. According to ILO models, that equates to a global unemployment rate of 6.3% this year, falling to 5.7% next year but still up on the pre-pandemic rate of 5.4% in 2019. In a report, World Employment and Social Outlook: Trends 2021, the ILO said: Employment growth will be insufficient to make up for the losses suffered until at least 2023.

Checkpoints between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides of Cyprus are to reopen on Friday, the United Nations has said, marking the first time restrictions have been eased since December 2020 because of the pandemic. Cyprus is split between its Greek and Turkish Cypriot populations, with a number of designated checkpoints controlling movements between the north and south of the island. “The reopening of all crossing points will facilitate free movement, promote people to people contacts, build trust and have an overall positive socio-economic impact across the island for the benefit of all Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots,” the United Nations mission on Cyprus, UNFICYP, said in a statement. Reuters report that a committee of health experts from both sides would be assessing the situation on a bi-weekly basis. Vehicle and pedestrian crossings have been subject to on-and-off closures since February 2020, when the Greek Cypriot side shut the checkpoints for the first time in decades as a precaution to quell the spread of the virus. Under present circumstances, people who cross will require a seven-day negative antigen test or PCR test, the peacekeeping mission said. Rural northern California is seeing a troubling rise in Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations, an alarming trend that comes as residents and businesses continue to protest against safety measures and vaccinations – with one Mendocino cafe threatening to charge customers $5 for wearing a mask. While the region makes up a small proportion of the state’s population, the growth in its caseload has been considerable, and comes at a time when the state overall is enjoying some of the lowest rates of Covid in the country. After largely avoiding the worst of the pandemic, a block of far northern California counties now leads the state with nearly 40 cases per 100,000 residents over the past week, according to statistics maintained by the Los Angeles Times. Tehama county ranked the highest in the LA Times case ratings with 139 cases per 100,000 residents. Meanwhile 10 of the 21 total Covid deaths in nearby Siskiyou county have occurred since the beginning of May. The region has long been one of the most forceful in its pushback against measures such as masks, business restrictions and vaccine mandates – and the protests have only continued to gain steam. A cafe in the town of Mendocino made headlines after announcing it will charge customers a $5 fee if they order while wearing a mask. It also threatened to charge $5 to anyone “caught bragging about your vaccine”. “It’s about time the proponents of these ineffective government measures start paying for the collateral damage they have collectively caused,” the cafe owner Chris Castleman told NBC News. He also offered a 50% discount to customers who threw their masks in the trash. George Rutherford, a professor of epidemiology at the University of California, San Francisco, said the current situation feels inevitable. “I was waiting for this to happen,” he said, adding that the outbreaks mirror trends occurring in southern and eastern Oregon, just north of California’s border. “It shows you where vaccination is lagging and transmission is taking place.” Read more of Erin McCormick’s report from Berkeley: ‘Waiting to happen’: the California region where masks are taboo - and cases are rising The World Health Organization has approved the Sinovac Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use – the second Chinese vaccine to receive the WHO’s green light. The WHO said the emergency use listing gives countries, funders, procuring agencies and communities assurance that the vaccine has met international standards. Last month Sinopharm became the first Chinese vaccine to be approved by the WHO. The GAVI vaccine alliance is in talks with Sinovac to expand the Covax dose-sharing portfolio available to poor countries following the WHO approval. India has reported 132,788 new cases over the past 24 hours, and an additional 3,207 deaths. China has reported 24 new cases, including 10 domestic cases all in Guangdong province where authorities have imposed localised lockdown measures to control an outbreak. International flights to Vietnam’s two biggest cities are to resume, reversing a short-lived ban imposed over fears of a new coronavirus wave. AstraZeneca has said it would soon provide Thailand with 1.8m doses of locally manufactured Covid-19 vaccine, the first of multiple batches this month, just days out from the launch of its mass vaccination drive. Germany’s top diplomat in Taipei has said his government has been helping in talks between Taiwan and drugmaker BioNTech to supply Covid-19 vaccines, after Taiwan said a deal fell apart earlier this year due to Chinese “intervention”. Taiwan announced 372 new cases and 12 deaths in its latest daily update. Poland will raise the limit for the number of guests at large gatherings such as weddings to 150 from 50 from 6 June. People who have been vaccinated against the coronavirus will not be counted as part of this limit Russia’s single-dose Sputnik Light vaccine has been approved for use in Mauritius. Russia’s third vaccine, CoviVac, is more than 80% effective, according to preliminary data. Mexico has revised its death count, adding 4,272 fatalities. The clinical review of past deaths, by a team of doctors and nurses, is largely a record-keeping exercise. The Victorian government in Australia will now require people to check in at retail stores and supermarkets regardless of the length of time they spend in the store, as new data reveals a huge increase in check-ins to the Service Victoria app once the state forced businesses to begin using it. The Victorian government in Australia will now require people to check in at retail stores and supermarkets regardless of the length of time they spend in the store, as new data reveals a huge increase in check-ins to the Service Victoria app once the state forced businesses to begin using it. As part of the extension of the lockdown in Melbourne, the acting premier, James Merlino, announced on Wednesday that supermarkets and retailers would be required to make everyone check in when they entered into the store. Previously it was only a recommendation. After the state recorded a number of Covid-19 transmissions at retail stores where the contacts had “fleeting” contact, Victoria’s chief health officer, Prof Brett Sutton, said the change was to ensure records of everyone at potential exposure sites were complete. “We are in a position now where the Victorian community is motivated to do the right thing and they understand the importance of contact tracing in this space,” he said. “And even though we have been doing really well in identifying people at all exposure sites, I think everyone recognises that we have to do absolutely everything in our power to be able to chase down every single person who may be exposed because it is that one person who is not found who may be the one who spreads it.” The Victorian government launched its Covid QR-code check-in app, Service Victoria, at the end of November 2020 but continued to allow hospitality venues to to use their own QR-code systems to record people visiting. Read more of Josh Taylor’s report here: Victoria makes Covid check-in mandatory at shops after transmissions from ‘fleeting’ visits Drugmaker AstraZeneca has said it would soon provide Thailand with 1.8m doses of locally manufactured Covid-19 vaccine, the first of multiple batches this month, just days out from the launch of its mass vaccination drive. The announcement in a joint statement by AstraZeneca and Siam Bioscience, a firm owned by Thailand’s king, comes amid public anxiety about vaccine supplies, as the country suffers its most severe outbreak so far. The statement did not say whether the Thai plant would make all 6m doses that Thailand’s government has promised would be available this month. Reuters report that the government’s immunisation drive starts on Monday and relies almost entirely on its reserved 61m doses of AstraZeneca vaccine, the majority of which it said would come from Siam Bioscience, which is making vaccines for the first time. Questions about Siam Bioscience meeting production targets are sensitive because King Maha Vajiralongkorn is its sole owner. Insulting Thailand’s monarchy is a crime punishable by up to 15 years in prison. Thai health minister Anutin Charnvirakul said on Wednesday the promised 6m doses would come this month “as planned”, but did not specify delivery dates or how many would be sourced locally. “We will get AstraZeneca vaccine. It may come from wherever, but all AstraZeneca just the same. It could be made in Thailand or imported from overseas. It depends on AstraZeneca’s supply chain,” Anutin told reporters. A one-liner from Reuters here that Russia’s single-dose Sputnik Light vaccine against Covid-19 has been approved for use in Mauritius, Russia’s RDIF sovereign wealth fund, which markets the shot internationally, said today. Germany’s top diplomat in Taipei has said his government has been helping in talks between Taiwan and drugmaker BioNTech to supply Covid-19 vaccines, after Taiwan said a deal fell apart earlier this year due to Chinese “intervention”. China denied that accusation. But a war of words escalated after Taiwan rejected Beijing’s offer to supply it with shots made by Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group, which holds a contract to sell them in Greater China. In a Facebook post in Chinese on Wednesday, Thomas Prinz, Germany’s de facto ambassador to Taiwan, said they had “noticed the recent controversy regarding vaccine acquisition”. “Please believe that the German government, especially federal economy minister Altmaier himself, have made great efforts in the continuous communication and coordination between Taiwan and BioNTech,” he said, adding that whether a contract is eventually signed would depend on the two parties, report Reuters. “If the parties to the contract can reach a consensus, the federal government is naturally happy to see it happen.” Nicola Slawson has opened up our UK live blog for the day, which is immediately leading with the debate over the government’s plan for post-pandemic “catch-up” education provision in England. You can follow that with her here: I’ll be continuing here with the latest coronavirus developments from around the world. My colleague Frances Ryan writes for us this morning about how transformational being able to work from home has been life-changing for disabled people, and says don’t take it away now: At the start of the first lockdown, I reported that society was opening up to millions of disabled and chronically ill people as “virtual living” became the norm – from Zoom job interviews and streamed gigs and theatre to NHS phone appointments. But just as it took the non-disabled public to experience a dose of what disabled people have for years before access was improved, the fear is that any gains made during the pandemic will be discarded now that the wider public no longer need them themselves. Take work for example. The shift to working at home over the past year brought new opportunities to those previously excluded from the workforce. As one woman with agoraphobia told me: “Lockdown has opened my world” – it allowed her to get a job from her front room. But as ministers and some employers push for a return to the office, many disabled workers are worried their hard-won progress will go backwards. A research scientist with endometriosis and IBS told me her employer has already stopped letting her work from home full-time, even though her job can be done remotely. “The office is ‘going back to normal’ and they don’t want us at home even though I can do a better job [here],” she said. The Zoom pub quiz became a cliche of lockdown, but what many of us did informally with friends was also replicated by companies, with art exhibitions streaming online or bars running virtual club nights. As venues open back up, I’m hearing from scores of disabled people losing out. Read more here: Frances Ryan – Remote working has been life-changing for disabled people, don’t take it away now The GAVI vaccine alliance is in talks with Chinese drugmaker Sinovac to expand the Covax dose-sharing portfolio available to poor countries following the World Health Organization’s approval of its Covid-19 vaccine earlier today, a GAVI spokesperson said. “Gavi, on behalf of the Covax Facility, is in dialogue with several manufacturers, including Sinovac, to expand and diversify the portfolio further and secure access to additional doses for Facility participants,” a statement reported by Reuters said. The main Covid focus in England today hasn’t been the pandemic itself, but government proposals to help pupils “catch-up” on learning they may have missed. The package has been roundly criticised, as Haroon Siddique reports: The £1.4bn announced for the post-pandemic catch-up programme for pupils in England is “pitiful” and a fraction of that committed by other countries to help children’s education, a school leaders’ union has said. Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), hit out at the government on Wednesday as it faced scrutiny over why the money is about a 10th of the £15bn total understood to have been recommended by the education recovery commissioner, Sir Kevan Collins. Barton said the government package was “dispiriting” and accused the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, of having lower ambitions for children than those of his union’s members. “It’s pretty pitiful, only yesterday we were hearing stories about extending the school day and even if some people disagreed with it, at least there was a sense of ‘let’s do something radical, let’s do something different’,” he told Sky News. “Today’s announcement essentially equates to £50 per head, you compare that with the USA which is putting £1,600 per head, per young person, or the Netherlands, £2,500 per head. So what is it about those children in the Netherlands or the USA that makes them worth more than our government seems to say? It’s time to stop the rhetoric I think and start the action on behalf of children and young people.” During a series of interviews of Wednesday, Williamson struggled to explain the discrepancy between the announced government spending and that recommended by Collins, who was appointed in February by Downing Street to lead efforts to make up for the damage done by the coronavirus pandemic, particularly to pupils from more deprived backgrounds.

People who have been vaccinated against the coronavirus will not be counted as part of this limit, Reuters report that Adam Niedzielski told a news conference. Many countries in the world have been looking on enviously at the very small number of cases in Australia over recent months, but a new cluster has left people asking questions about the country’s approach. Michael Toole writes for us this morning: Just two weeks ago, Australians were living in a Covid-19-free environment that was unthinkable this time last year. Even in Melbourne, people were once again meeting family and friends at cafes, pubs and cinemas. Football games were played in front of packed stadiums. But that came to an abrupt halt when a new cluster of cases was identified in Melbourne early last week. This outbreak has now grown to 60 known cases across the greater metropolitan area, including several aged care workers and two residents. Genomic sequencing links all these cases to a man who was infected while staying in an Adelaide quarantine hotel. As Melbourne moves into a second week of lockdown, it’s worth asking why we’re back in this all too familiar situation. Two issues that loom the largest in explaining how we got here are a hotel quarantine system that clearly doesn’t work as well as it could, and a more concerning virus variant that seems to have taken full advantage of the time it circulated undetected from the Wollert man to case number five – the key piece of rotten luck in this outbreak. Add to that a painfully slow rollout of vaccines and, deeply worryingly, the related lack of attention to the safety of aged care home residents and staff. Read more here: Michael Toole – Australia is in a race against Covid-19. I’m waiting to hear the starting gun International flights to Vietnam’s two biggest cities are to resume, AFP reports, reversing a short-lived ban imposed over fears of a new coronavirus wave. The Civil Aviation Administration of Vietnam on Monday announced a temporary suspension for international passenger arrivals at Hanoi’s Noi Bai airport from 1-7 June. A similar decision was in force for the airport in commercial capital Ho Chi Minh City until 14 June, as the country struggles to contain a virus outbreak in more than half of its territories. But today the aviation authority told airports and airlines that it had reversed the suspension, without mentioning a timeframe or giving an explanation. Vietnam has managed to keep infection rates low, but cases have more than doubled in the past month and now stand at more than 7,500, with 48 deaths. With less than two months left until the start of the Tokyo Olympic Games, Japan’s Asahi Breweries still doesn’t know whether fans will be allowed into stadiums to buy its beer. Japan has scaled back its Olympic plans amid the pandemic and a slow national vaccine rollout. Foreign spectators won’t be allowed in the country and organisers have yet to decide how many domestic spectators, if any, can attend. More than 60 Japanese companies together paid a record of more than $3bn to sponsor the Tokyo Games, an event most Japanese want cancelled or delayed again. Sponsors paid another $200m to extend contracts after the Games were delayed last year. Many are uncertain how to proceed with advertising campaigns or marketing events, according to 12 officials and sources at companies directly involved in sponsorship who spoke to Reuters. Asahi has the exclusive rights to sell beer, wine and non-alcoholic beer at the stadiums, but even if spectators are allowed, the Tokyo government has no plans to allow alcohol at its public viewing sites outside venues, a representative said. Sponsors have grown frustrated with what they see as slow decision-making and have complained to the organisers, Eimi Yamamitsu and Maki Shiraki report. “There are so many different scenarios that we can’t prepare,” said the source. Some domestic firms, worried about opposition to the Games, have called off plans for commercials featuring Olympic athletes or supporting Japanese national teams, said a person with direct knowledge of the matter. “I’m worried that by airing Olympic ads, it could be negative for the company,” said a source at a domestic sponsor. “At this point, no amount of publicity we could get would make up for what we paid.” Some top-tier global sponsors, whose contracts run until 2024, are scaling down Tokyo promotions and deferring budgets for Beijing in 2022 or Paris in 2024, said a second person with direct knowledge of the matter, and the employee of the sponsor company who was briefed on the issue. But domestic sponsors don’t have another Olympics. “That’s why we can’t simply quit,” said the source at the domestic sponsor. Bit of a reporting chain here, but Reuters is quoting Interfax saying that Russia’s third vaccine against Covid-19, CoviVac, is more than 80% effective according to preliminary data. The Chumakov Centre could produce six times more than the previously planned 10m doses of the vaccine a year, Interfax added. Australia’s Covid vaccination programme has lacked urgency at every stage, with the government forced to revise its own targets and never seeming to meet its own goals. Victoria’s latest outbreak has exposed Scott Morrison government’s failure to successfully get the vaccine out to even the most vulnerable in the community. The outbreak has hit unvaccinated aged care workers, despite federal promises they would be vaccinated by March. Along with mixed messages about the urgency of getting Australia vaccinated, the Morrison government became mired in a debate about whether Australia’s coronavirus vaccination rollout is or is not a race. Our multimedia team has put together this video report: Taiwan has announced 372 new cases of Covid-19 and 12 deaths in its latest daily update. The CECC also announced 177 cases across the preceding five days from the backlog of test results. The number is a significant increase from yesterday, when 262 new cases were reported, with just 65 from the backlog. The backlog is clearing, authorities have assured, but in the meantime it has continued to cause problems in analysis of trends and response measures. Health and welfare minister Chen Shih-Chung said it wasn’t clear if today’s rise was due to an increase in cases or faster reporting times, local media said. Chen also gave some updates about Taiwan’s vaccination process – a complicated issue, which involves accusations of geopolitical interference as well as of government bungling. The government has procured around 1m doses so far for 23.5 million people, and has ordered tens of millions more – a significant proportion of which are domestically produced vaccine candidates in trial stage. Chen told the media he hopes that once they have enough supply, they will be able to administer 1m doses per week, through Taiwan’s 300 hospitals, 800 clinics and 200 other locations. According to local media he said any businesses with more than 1,000 employees can host a vaccination stop. Chen said the government hopes to have 60% of the population receive at least one dose by October. It’s potentially a tall order, requiring about 14m doses. Currently Taiwan has received 850,000 doses, a mix of AstraZeneca and Moderna. It has ordered about 4.5m more from Moderna, 9.2m from Astrazeneca, and 4.7m via Covax, but the imminent arrival of any of these is far from confirmed given the aforementioned complications and global shortages. Another 10m have been ordered via two Taiwan producers, but these vaccines are still in trial stage. Producers have said they intend to apply for emergency use this month – international approval likely a long way after that. In the UK, Labour’s opposition spokesperson on education, Kate Green, has called for more support for extra-curricular activities in schools as part of the Covid catch-up package being proposed by the government. She told BBC Breakfast: “What we’re proposing is that there should be a range of measures in a package of support for children and young people. “Yes more time for small group tutoring and catching up on lost learning, but children can’t learn well if they’re worried, if they’re anxious, if they’re not having time to play and develop. “So we’re also suggesting support for extra-curricular activities, play, drama, art and so on, and of course in putting in mental health support in schools.” PA Media reports she added: “Children need some time to relax and enjoy life, over the summer and into the new school year we think the important thing is to make sure the fabulous facilities that schools have, the sports fields, the art rooms, the music rooms and so on, can be used for out-of-school activities too. “So we’re talking about school being open for longer but not for lots of extra formal learning, we don’t want children doing maths at five and six in the evening when they’re really tired.” Somewhere, someone in the UK government wrote “education” on their media grid for today, and so education minister Gavin Williamson has been sent out on the airwaves with details of plans to help pupils in the UK catch-up with schooling they may have missed during the pandemic. He has endured quite a torrid time in a somewhat bad-tempered appearance on Sky News, where at one point he was told that the presenter hates doing shouty, repetitive interviews, but that the minister just wasn’t answering the questions. In particular, he was pressed over the discrepancy between the money offered – £1.4bn – and the amount that catch-up tsar Sir Kevan Collins has said is needed to increase education opportunities – £15bn. PA Media quotes Williams as saying: “It is a lot of money and it builds on £1.7bn that we’ve already committed in terms of actually delivering for children – it is an extra 100m hours of tutoring. “It is making sure that children who need that help, who need that support, that we’re delivering that tutoring revolution to help them get it. “But we recognise it is part of a process. Over the past 12 months, we have already announced a previous £1.7bn worth of additional funding and we are looking at a whole raft of additional ideas for how we can continue to support our children, making sure none of them are left behind. “We have been working very closely with Sir Kevan Collins and actually the interventions around tutoring, driving up teaching quality, these are very much built on the work we’ve been doing together, recognising how incredibly important it is that we take on these interventions in order to help children.” There’s more detail on the government plans here from my colleagues Peter Walker and Rachel Hall, who write that: Pupils will be offered an extra 100m hours of tuition under post-pandemic catch-up plans unveiled today – but the government faced immediate criticism of the £1.4bn programme, with its own tsar warning “more will be needed”. After months of unprecedented school closures, £1.4bn will be spent on up to 6m sets of 15-hour tutoring courses for disadvantaged pupils as well as an expansion of an existing fund for helping 16- to 19-year-olds with subjects such as English and maths, the Department for Education (DfE) said. There is also provision for extra training and support for teachers, and funding to allow some year-13 students to repeat their final year if it was badly affected by the pandemic. It gave no immediate verdict on mooted plans to extend schools days by 30 minutes. This idea, criticised as misplaced by some teaching unions, will be the subject of a separate review due to report later in the year. Today’s WorldView email from the Washington Post by Ishaan Tharoor makes for quite bleak reading. He writes that while in the US, life is returning to normal, the pandemic is getting worse, even when it seems like it’s getting better: The pandemic is hardly in retreat elsewhere. The emergence of more virulent variants and the slowness of vaccination efforts in many places outside the West have contributed to deadly new waves. Coronavirus case counts worldwide are already higher in 2021 than they were in 2020. Southeast Asia, once a bastion of resistance to the virus, is in the grip of a harrowing spike in infections. Cases in Thailand and Vietnam rose dramatically over the past month. Malaysia is now registering more new infections per million people than any medium- or large-size country in Asia, surpassing India. In Africa, concerns are growing over the possible arrival of a new wave powered by a more transmissible variant of the virus, with the health systems in many countries at risk of being quickly subsumed by a surge of infections. A recent study found that the continent has the world’s highest death rate of patients critically ill with covid-19, thanks to limited intensive care facilities and reserves of vital medical supplies like oxygen. In parts of Latin America, the virus rages on, largely unabated. Peru, according to its own government-adjusted data, now has the worst covid-19 mortality rate per capita in the world. Even in East Asia, where a handful of nations set the gold standard in preventing community spread, the virus is on the march. Taiwan has seen an explosion of cases over the past month. In Japan, which still intends to host the Summer Olympics, numerous areas including Tokyo remain under a state of emergency. Read more here: Washington Post – The pandemic is getting worse, even when it seems like it’s getting better Neil Lancefield, PA Media’s transport correspondent, has some quotes from Tom Bartosak-Harlow from the Confederation of Passenger Transport (CPT) this morning. He’s worried that if face coverings and social distancing requirements continue on public transport in England after they have been dropped in other settings, it will stigmatise the use of buses and trains. He said: We need to see public transport moving at the same pace as the rest of the country. If you no longer have to wear a face covering in certain situations such as hospitality and retail but you do on public transport, we think that would undermine confidence in public transport. If people have this view that going on a bus or a coach carries a greater risk of catching Covid, in the longer term that will encourage people to use their car. Good morning, it is Martin Belam here taking over in London, where this morning the mayor Sadiq Khan has been warning fans of Scottish football not to travel if they don’t have tickets when England and Scotland face each other at Wembley on 18 June. Khan joins the Scottish government and Scottish Football Association (SFA) to ask fans not to travel to the city unless they have a ticket, or a safe place to watch the match. He said: “I am so excited for Euro 2020 and one of the games that I am looking forward to the most is England’s match with Scotland at Wembley. “I have some amazing memories of England v Scotland games in the past and I love the atmosphere that Scottish fans always bring to major football tournaments. “However, I am today urging all fans to only come to London if you have a ticket for the match or if you have arranged a safe place to watch it from, in compliance with Covid-19 guidelines.” He added: “I want to be completely clear that Scottish fans will not be able to access their traditional Trafalgar Square base, as it will be used as a socially-distanced fan zone for key workers who are helping our city through the pandemic. “Due to Covid regulations there are no alternative sites for fans to gather in large numbers in central London.” Here’s how UK media reported the great news on Tuesday of zero Covid-related deaths in the country for the first day since the pandemic began. Many papers suggest that the first day without a single Covid death for 10 months means the complete easing of lockdown restrictions will go ahead in England as planned on 21 June. Mexico has revised its death count, adding 4,272 fatalities. The clinical review of past deaths, by a team of doctors and nurses, is largely a record-keeping exercise, AP reports. Mexico’s government has long acknowledged that the true death toll from the pandemic is far higher than the current total of 227,840, due to low testing capabilities. Many Mexicans have died at home, or never been tested. As well as the medical team-led reviews, another process also provides adjusted figures. The computerised search of death certificates for Covid-related symptoms has suggested more than 350,000 have died, which would give Mexico one of the highest per-capita fatality rates in the world. Reuters: A shipment of coronavirus vaccines to North Korea via the global Covax sharing programme that was expected for late May has been delayed again amid protracted consultations, South Korea’s unification ministry said on Tuesday. Covax, which secures vaccines for poor countries, has said it will provide nearly 2 million doses of AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine to North Korea. “Countries that want Covax support are required to hold various consultations and submit some documents including an inoculation plan,” a ministry official said. “But in North Korea’s case, such consultations have been prolonged and it appears that the shipment will be made later than initially planned.” Insular and secretive North Korea has not commented on any consultations on vaccines. It has not officially confirmed any Covid-19 infections, although Seoul officials have said an outbreak there cannot be ruled out as the North had trade and people-to-people exchanges with China before closing its border early last year. The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) alliance, which co-leads Covax with the World Health Organization (WHO), said work is ongoing and discussions continue with North Korea, but no shipment date was finalised. GAVI said last month that shipments have not been made to North Korea due to its lack of “technical preparedness” and global supply shortages but could be expected later this year. In a statement last week to the ongoing WHO annual assembly, North Korea accused unspecified countries of dominating vaccine supplies and causing a global “bottleneck” due to “national egoism.” “Some countries are procuring and storing the vaccines more than their needs ... when other countries can’t even procure it,” it said. In the last few hours a few countries have reported updated daily case numbers. India has reported 132,788 new cases over the past 24 hours, and an additional 3,207 deaths. Health ministry data says the country’s infection tally is about 28.3 million, with more than 335,000 deaths. In Germany, the Robert Koch Institute has said 4,917 new cases has brought the country’s total to 3,687,828, and an additional 179 fatalities has raised the death toll to 88,774. China has reported 24 new cases, including 10 domestic cases all in Guangdong province where authorities have imposed localised lockdown measures to control an outbreak. It also reported seven asymptomatic cases in Guangdong, which are counted separately. Via AFP: The World Health Organization has approved the Sinovac Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use – the second Chinese vaccine to receive the WHO’s green light. The UN health agency signed off on CoronaVac, a two-dose vaccine developed by the Beijing-based firm which is already being deployed in several countries around the world. The WHO said the emergency use listing (EUL) gives countries, funders, procuring agencies and communities assurance that the vaccine has met international standards. Last month Sinopharm became the first Chinese vaccine to be approved by the WHO. The organisation has also given EUL status to vaccines being made by Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and the AstraZeneca jab being produced in India, South Korea and the EU, which it counts separately. WHO’s listing paves the way for countries worldwide to approve and import a vaccine for distribution quickly, especially those states without an international-standard regulator of their own. It also opens the door for the jabs to enter the Covax global vaccine-sharing facility, which aims to provide equitable access to doses around the world, particularly in poorer countries. Currently only AstraZeneca and some Pfizer jabs are flowing through the scheme. Read more here: Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s continuing rolling coverage of the pandemic. You can catch up on the previous live blog here, or see below for a quick roundup of the past 24 hours. The Australian state of Victoria has extended its lockdown for another seven days as it works to control an outbreak in Melbourne. The UK has enjoyed a day without a single reported Covid death for the first time since the pandemic began. India said it is aiming to triple capacity to 10 million jabs per day by July to avert another wave of Covid-19 infections as deadly as the outbreak suffered since April. A Brazilian Supreme Court judge has given president Jair Bolsonaro five days to submit information regarding the government’s decision to host the Copa America football tournament despite the nation’s ongoing struggles with Covid-19. A decrease in local Covid-19 vaccine production has slowed the pace of Brazil’s inoculation drive and contributed to a growing number of people not taking their second doses, according to the latest data from the Fiocruz biomedical institute. Heathrow airport in London has begun processing arrivals from red list countries in a dedicated terminal following concerns about them mixing with other passengers. Travellers arriving from red list nations on direct flights are being taken to Terminal 3. Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa called on faster delivery of vaccines to poorer countries, including by waiving patents on vaccine development. Peru has revised its official Covid-19 death toll to 180,764, nearly triple the previous official figure of 69,342, following a government review that shows the severity of the outbreak in the country. The World Health Organisation has recommended a new set of names for the coronavirus “variants of concern”, which will be known by letters of the Greek alphabet. Alpha is the new name for UK/Kent (B.1.1.7), Beta for South Africa (B.1.351), Gamma for Brazil (P.1) and Delta for the variant first detected in India (B.1.617.2). Malaysia has begun a tough nationwide lockdown to battle a worsening coronavirus outbreak. Of almost 2,800 deaths from Covid-19 recorded in the country of 32 million since the start of the pandemic, over 40 percent were in May alone. Israel announced it will begin phasing out coronavirus-related payments to the unemployed and Ireland announced similar steps later this year while maintaining other income and business supports as the economy fully reopens. The Coachella music festival will return to the US in April 2022 after being repeatedly delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic, organisers have announced.","charCount":"55302","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/yohannes-lowe\">Yohannes Lowe</a> (now); <a href=\"profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a> and <a href=\"profile/helen-davidson\">Helen Davidson</a> (earlier)"},{"headline":"How the Covid shock has radicalised generation Z","standfirst":"<p>Analysis: young people’s testimonies show they are ready to draw systemic conclusions from the handling of the pandemic by political elites<br></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/02/a-sacrificed-generation-psychological-scars-of-covid-on-young-may-have-lasting-impact\">‘A sacrificed generation’: psychological scars of Covid on young may have lasting impact</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2021/jun/02/so-many-revolutions-to-lead-europe-generation-z-on-their-post-covid-future\">‘So many revolutions to lead’: Europe’s Gen Z on their post-Covid future</a></li></ul>","trailText":"Analysis: young people’s testimonies show they are ready to draw systemic conclusions from the handling of the pandemic by political elites<br>","byline":"Paul Mason","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4ecebb10bb0e002215687304941448c08913ecc2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ecebb10bb0e002215687304941448c08913ecc2/0_78_3600_2159/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters in Puerta del Sol Square, Madrid, during a rally against Spain’s economic crisis and soaring jobless rate in 2011.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters in Puerta del Sol Square, Madrid, during a rally against Spain’s economic crisis and soaring jobless rate in 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Javier Soriano/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>They have been tested, examined, judged and graded since childhood; told they must excel, compete and succeed.

Two Black brothers <a href=\"https://www.phillymag.com/news/2018/06/25/robert-wilson-murder-plea-deal/\">plead guilty to the killing</a>. John McNesby of a local police union responds: “If there’s ever a classic case for a death penalty case, this is it.” After all, one of Krasner’s predecessors, Lynne Abraham, became known as “the country’s deadliest DA” because of her aggressive pursuit of capital punishment.</p> <p>But there is a new, more liberal sheriff in town. Krasner has always opposed the death penalty, which was used <a href=\"https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/facts-and-research/dpic-reports/dpic-year-end-reports/the-death-penalty-in-2020-year-end-report\">17 times in America</a> last year alone. He served on a jury in one such case when he was 23, before going to law school, where he studied the punishment carefully. Then he became a civil rights lawyer who defended people in death penalty cases.</p> <p>“It’s quite an experience to be standing in front of a jury when the prosecutor’s purpose is to kill your client,” he explains by phone. “That’s quite a moment. So it’s an issue I’ve thought a lot about and it’s an issue I feel strongly about and that particular episode covers a scenario in which basically every one of my predecessors would have sought the death penalty for reasons that were at least as political as they were philosophical.”</p> <p>He adds: “I did the thing that was not politically normal at all but which I thought was justice, and that was we did not pursue the death penalty in a case involving the killing of a police officer during a robbery. It was a specific decision about a specific case.</p> <p>“It was a decision that reflected, among other things, that the two different mothers [of Wilson’s two sons] were not supportive of the death penalty. But their position was not the traditional one and therefore we were really up against the police union trying to use the entire scenario in a ghoulish way for their own politics.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"400fdcc9e492436439c10725fcde1b22d75f454b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/400fdcc9e492436439c10725fcde1b22d75f454b/130_0_1799_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A still from Philly DA\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The film poses the classic question of whether all idealists are destined, as the much quoted phrase goes, to campaign in poetry and govern in prose. Krasner was seen as a outsider candidate in 2017 – when Philadelphia had one of the highest incarceration rates of any major city – but pulled off <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/philly/news/politics/city/larry-krasner-wins-race-for-philly-da-20171107.html\">a landslide victory</a> with huge support from African American voters. Does he feel that he has been able to stay true to his principles or were there moments when he bowed to pragmatism?</p> <p>“I think in many ways the reason we got so much resistance in the first term is because we did what we said we would do,” he replies firmly. “Doing what you say you will do does not necessarily mean you always succeed.</p> <p>“We said we were going to go to cut mass incarceration; we cut future years of incarceration in half. We said we were going to cut mass supervision on probation and parole; we cut that by two-thirds. I can list a few more enormous achievements, including exonerating 20 people at this point, almost all of whom are completely innocent, that stand in stark contrast to our predecessors.</p> <p>“But we also said we were going to push against the cash bail system. We did push against the cash bail system but ultimately realised that it’s going to take state legislation to eliminate the use of cash bail in order for us to eliminate it completely because we don’t control that. Bail is not set by us; bail is set by judges.”</p> <p>Voters evidently agree that Krasner <a href=\"https://krasnerforda.com/promises-kept\">kept his promises</a> and his soul. Last month, despite the police union throwing its weight and money against him, <a href=\"https://hosted.ap.org/thetimes-tribune/article/a9a4bcd720a38265e477db2f27086703/incumbent-philadelphia-prosecutor-larry-krasner-wins\">he won resoundingly</a> in a Democratic primary election seen as a test of progressive prosecutors’ sustainability,</p> <p>“So even where there is frustration, the voters understood and Philadelphia understood, so long as you have tried to do the right thing, you have tried to be fair, you have not simply compromised out of some sort of political expediency, they respect that.</p> <p>“I think the real story of our first term is that our opponents came at us with flamethrowers because we did what we said we would do, we accomplished so much, and therefore they felt it was necessary to turn us back because we were accomplishing what we said we would do.”</p> <p>No one wielded an angrier flamethrower than <a href=\"https://twitter.com/john_mcnesby?lang=en\">John McNesby</a>, president of the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP), Lodge 5. But Krasner is careful to distinguish this union, which he says has always been led by conservative white men (“people who came up at a time when policing was all about brutality and racism”), from the police department as a whole, which is more representative of Philadelphia’s racial diversity than it used to be.</p> <p>“There are some deeply troubling white supremacist elements in the police department and they are coddled if not encouraged by the head of the police union, a guy named John McNesby, who also referred to Black Lives Matter as “<a href=\"https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/police-union-president-calls-black-lives-matter-protesters-outside-philadelphia-officers-house-a-pack-of-rabid-animals-report/26796/\">a pack of rabid animals</a>”.

Its prisons contain more people than big cities such as Philadelphia or Dallas and express system racism in concrete and steel. But solutions do not necessarily lie with the White House. “People think that criminal policy in the United States is set by the federal government,” says film-maker Yoni Brook. “But in actuality, when you think about mass incarceration, there’s over 2,000 district attorneys and state attorneys and local prosecutors with a huge amount of unchecked discretion to decide what is a crime and what isn’t a crime.

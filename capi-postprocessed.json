To the dismay of company directors, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic) has previously been regarded as friendly or neutral towards short-sellers. But in a statement released on Tuesday, Asic claimed that short-sellers were “making false or misleading statements” and “using overly emotive or inflammatory language to distort the facts” in order to drive share prices down. It called on short-sellers to release their reports while the market was closed so that companies had time to prepare a response, fact-check their reports with target companies and “avoid overly emotive, intemperate or imprecise language”. Companies that were targeted by short-reports should go into a trading halt and “respond comprehensively”, Asic said. Tim Murray, the managing partner of short-seller J Capital Research, said Asic was privileging good news about companies over bad. “What Asic is saying is corporates can put out press releases and sell-side analysis-positive reports during trading hours but negative reports only outside trading hours,” he said. “There is asymmetry in treatment of positive and negative reporting. Investors need time to digest positive information as much as they do negative. Positive press releases by corporates are often without detail and cause the stock to increase significantly. “With these ill-considered guidelines Asic is behaving like the German regulators in response to criticism of Wirecard,” he said. Wirecard, a German payments processing company that had offices in Australia, collapsed in June last year after accounting firm EY discovered a €1.9bn (A$3m) black hole in its accounts. Short-sellers Zatarra Research first attacked Wirecard in 2016, accusing the company of “wide-scale corruption and corporate fraud” – allegations the company denied. Rather than look into the allegations, the German regulator, Bafin, instead launched an investigation into Zatarra. In a statement, Zatarra’s successor, Viceroy Research, said Asic’s new information sheet seemed well-intentioned but was misguided. “The world saw recently what happens when a regulator takes sides in the market; Bafin’s handling of the Wirecard fiasco significantly harmed investor confidence in the markets and their regulation,” it said. “Regulating our investigations with license requirements, and discussions with perpetrators of fraud, will detract short-sellers and the valuable information they provide to Asic. “The suggestion that authors ‘fact check with the target entity’ is laughably naive in its assumption that every targeted company is a tragically misunderstood ‘good guy’. “The crux of many reports is that management have made false and misleading statements; they are unlikely to be honest when short-report authors come knocking. More likely, these ‘fact checks’ will result in pre-emptive legal action and other coercion.” Murray said Asic was “signalling to corporates they should list in Australia if they want to avoid market scrutiny”. The regulator wrongly assumed that “all companies are good actors” when the collapse of insurer HIH in 2001 and 2018’s banking royal commission showed that was not the case, he said. He said there would be many risks for J Capital if it contacted research targets before publication. “Some companies will use this as an opportunity to action an emergency plan to counter short-attacks such as announcing a share buyback in advance or the day of publication,” he said. “We have found this a common tactic of unethical companies.” He said Asic’s new guidance might also conflict with the regulator’s existing advice that research findings should not be “communicated outside the research report provider before the report is provided to clients in the normal course of business”. “If we contact the corporate in advance, that may be considered selective publishing,” he said. An Asic spokesman declined to provide any examples of “short and distort” campaigns. He denied the regulator had changed its general position on short-selling. However, the information sheet issued on Tuesday is believed to be the first time that Asic has ever used the phrase “short and distort” in its official communications. The move comes after other director-friendly moves by the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, that include attacking proxy advisers, who give investors advice on how to vote at shareholder meetings, and proposing to water down continuous disclosure rules that force companies to keep investors informed about significant developments that might affect their share prices.","charCount":"4738","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/ben-butler\">Ben Butler</a>"},{"headline":"French Open: reaction to Osaka exit, plus Barty and Nadal in action – live!","standfirst":"<ul><li>The latest news from around the courts at Roland Garros</li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2021/may/31/were-not-the-good-guys-osaka-shows-up-problems-of-press-conferences\">Jonathan Liew: Osaka shows problem with press conferences</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/may/31/roger-federer-eases-to-comfortable-win-over-denis-istomin-on-slam-return\">Federer returns with comfortable win</a> | <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/may/31/johanna-konta-knocked-out-of-french-open-after-first-round-defeat-to-cirstea\">Konta knocked out</a></li><li>Any comments?

I wish her the earliest possible recovery,” Japan Tennis Association (JTA) Executive Director Toshihisa Tsuchihashi said in a statement. Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato told a news conference that he would “watch over her quietly” and there was concern on the streets of Tokyo for the woman who will be one of the faces of this year’s Olympic Games in the city. “I think she’s under a lot of pressure, more than we can imagine,” kimono dresser Tomomi Noguchi, 67, told Reuters. She got to the top when she was young so I think we can’t really imagine what she’s going through.” Vickie Skorji, who manages a helpline at TELL, a non-profit counselling service in Japan, said society needed to be “more respectful and supportive” of mental health. “Who has asked her how she is doing? She put out a statement and said ‘I need to take care of myself,’ and she’s been punished,” Skorji said. “I think she is courageous and needs support.” And De Minaur takes that first set 6-2, nice and easy so far for him. Japan’s Yasutaka Uchiyama has taken the first set 6-3 against the Italian, Marco Cecchinato. Per Reuters, on Osaka. There was some criticism of Roland Garros organisers for their handling of the matter. French Tennis Federation President Gilles Moretton read a prepared statement on Monday offering Osaka their support but the irony of him not taking questions, given the context of the row, was not lost on some. “So the FFT handled the Ms Osaka mental health concerns without empathy or sensitivity. Then the FFT President refuses to take questions at a presser. An own goal,” wrote former Australian tennis official Richard Ings. Alex de Minaur, the Australian 21st seed, has got himself in a commanding position in the first set against Stefano Travaglia. He’s winning 5-1, and serving well. It does look tres beau. Some big names from across sport have spoken out for Osaka. Martina Navratilova: I am so sad about Naomi Osaka. I truly hope she will be ok. As athletes we are taught to take care of our body, and perhaps the mental and emotional aspect gets short shrift. This is about more than doing or not doing a press conference. Good luck Naomi - we are all pulling for you! Billie-Jean King: It’s incredibly brave that Naomi Osaka has revealed her truth about her struggle with depression. Right now, the important thing is that we give her the space and time she needs. We wish her well. NBA legend Steph Curry: You shouldn’t ever have to make a decision like this - but so damn impressive taking the high road when the powers that be don’t protect their own. Major respect. Which leaves Piers Morgan. Far more to come on Osaka throughout the day, but we begin with some low-key stuff on the courts. Katarina Zavatska has just broken Maria Sakkari, the 17th seed, but is then immediately broken back. A glance at the Eurosport coverage see Babsi Schett, Boris Becker and Mats Wilander skirt the Osaka issue in a very quick intro but it won’t be going away. Serena Williams, after winning her first round match yesterday, had this to say. Of course, the big news at Roland Garros has not yet centred on what has happened on the court. There will be fallout through the day on Naomi Osaka’s withdrawal, and the press conferences will probably revolve around what press conferences are for, and met with sidesteps as neat as anything you see on the clay. Nevertheless, the show must - and will - go on and the return of Nadal to his kingdom will perhaps cool the unfortunate circus that has formed around l’affaire Osaka. He begins his campaign for his 14th (fourteenth) title by meeting the Australian, Alexei Popyrin, on Philippe-Chatrier. Before that, the 2019 women’s champions and number one seed, Ashleigh Barty, takes on Bernarda Pera, the American-Croatian. Here’s the full order of play.","charCount":"4424","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/john-brewin\">John Brewin</a> (now) and <a href=\"profile/adam-collins\">Adam Collins</a> (later)"},{"headline":"‘Throw the ingredients together with reckless abandon!’: Guardian readers on their tastiest foolproof bakes ","standfirst":"<p>Want to rustle up something delicious that is guaranteed to work?

This is Cameron’s chocolate banana cake, which knocks all others into oblivion and deserves a wider audience. Melt 175g margarine with 225g sugar and stir in 275g self-raising flour, 10g cocoa and 1½ tsp bicarbonate of soda. Take off the heat and stir in 3 beaten eggs, 2 mashed bananas and a dash of vanilla essence. Let the mix cool while the oven warms. Next, stir in 70g chocolate chips and sprinkle 30g on top (dark or milk), then bake for about an hour at 150C (140C fan)/300F/gas 2 in a 20cm cake tin. Sometimes I add orange rind, too. This is a dream when it comes to freezing and is more luxurious than yet another banana loaf. <strong>Alison</strong><strong>, retired, Glasgow</strong></p> <h2>No-knead bread</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ac7b059ede06b4d8f936a42fa12be34d487764a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac7b059ede06b4d8f936a42fa12be34d487764a8/0_94_1536_1201/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chris’s easy loaf\" width=\"1000\" height=\"782\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">All rise ...

Bake in the hot casserole dish for 30 minutes, then remove the lid and cook for a further 10-15 minutes. Leave to cool before eating (if you can wait).

It is made from 4oz (113g) flour, 4oz caster sugar, 4oz butter, 2 eggs and 2 tsp (1 tsp baking powder and 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda) – hence the name. We sometimes also add a mix of hot water and cocoa powder to make it into a rich chocolate cake, or a handful of toasted coconut flakes.

The annual eurozone consumer prices index rose by 2% in May, flash data shows, up from 1.6% in April. Energy prices were the biggest factor, surging by 13.1% over the last year (as crude prices recover from their slump early in the pandemic). Service sector firms also raised their prices, with annual services inflation rising to 1.1% from 0.9% in April, while non-energy industrial goods rose 0.7% and food, alcohol &amp; tobacco were 0.6% higher than a year ago. This takes inflation above the ECB’s inflation target of ‘close to, but below 2%’, and could intensify pressure from more hawkish policymakers to slow its pandemic bond-buying stimulus programme. Eurostat has also reported that unemployment across the eurozone fell in April, to 8.0% from 8.1% in March. However, that’s still higher than a year ago (it was 7.3% in April 2020), due to the heavy job losses caused by Covid-19. That shows that the economic damage of the pandemic has yet to heal (especially with the eurozone falling into recession last quarter). It adds: Eurostat estimates that 15.380 million men and women in the EU, of whom 13.030 million in the euro area, were unemployed in April 2021. Compared with March 2021, the number of persons unemployed decreased by 165 000 in the EU and by 134 000 in the euro area. Compared with April 2020, unemployment rose by 1.406 million in the EU and by 1.275 million in the euro area. UK factories might growing even faster if they weren’t constrained by supply chain problems, says Mike Thornton, partner and head of manufacturing at accountancy giant RSM. He says supply shortages are now biting, as firms consume stocks built up ahead of the Brexit deadline at the end of 2020. ‘It’s great to see another increase in the latest CIPS Manufacturing PMI to a record high of 65.6 from 60.9; and reinforces the important role that UK manufacturing will play in the economic recovery this year. ‘It also demonstrates the resilience of manufacturers in a chaotic market; but supply chain disruption is really starting to bite now. Not only is there a shortage of certain components which is stalling production, but the cost of shipping certain products or materials is through the roof. This extra expense is the last thing manufacturers need as they try to trade out of unprecedented times. ‘Brexit stockpiling has cushioned the blow for many manufacturers at the start of the year; but as stocks dwindle and supply chain disruption remains, we could see further pressure on input costs and production – pushing prices up even further for consumers. ‘It’s such a shame that post-Brexit and pandemic supply chain disruption could curb economic growth at a time when manufacturers are looking to maximise the opportunity of pent up consumer spend.’ The Office for National Statistics has reported that the number of companies citing Brexit as their main challenge rose at the start of the year – replacing Covid-19 as the biggest problem for the largest proportion of firms. Here’s a good snap summary of the purchasing manager survey, from EY Item Club’s Howard Archer: By surging to 65.6 in May, the UK manufacturing PMI has burst above July 1994’s previous record high of 61.0, as well as April’s reading of 60.9. It’s now signalled an improvement in the factory sector for the last 12 months, following the first lockdown in April and May 2020. A surge of new orders has helped Britain’s factory sector to post a record increase in activity last month, as the easing of lockdown restrictions boosted demand. The UK Manufacturing PMI jumped to 65.6 in May, up from 60.9 in April, and the highest since the survey began in 1992 (any reading over 50 shows growth). IHS Markit, which compiles the survey, reports that conditions in the manufacturing sector improved at an unprecedented rate in May. Output growth strengthened, and new orders rose at the quickest pace on record. Markit says: Companies linked new order growth to rising business confidence, the further re-opening of the UK economy and reduced issues relating to COVID-19. New export orders also rose at a survey-record pace in May, amid reports of stronger demand from the EU, the US and China. But while large companies saw record gains in new export work, small firms only saw a smaller rise. Employment jumped at a record pace, with manufacturers taking on staff to handle high levels of pent-up demand. Supply disruption was a growing problem too, with companies reporting shortages of electronics, plastics and metals, transport delays and higher demand for raw materials. This drove up input costs at a record pace, leading to an unprecedented rise in output prices too, in a further sign that inflationary pressures are building. Rob Dobson, Director at IHS Markit, said UK factories benefitted from the easing of lockdown restrictions, as vaccine rollouts help economies unlock. But he also warns that consumers will see higher prices, as the jump in input costs is passed on. “The UK PMI surged to an unprecedented high in May, as record growth of new orders and employment supported one of the steepest increases in production volumes in the near 30-year survey history. Growth is being boosted by the unlocking of economies from COVID restrictions and ongoing vaccination programs. This is being felt across the globe, as highlighted by a record rise in new export business during the latest survey month. The corollaries of this strong upsurge in industrial activity are increased strain on supply chains and a build-up of price pressures. Supplies of inputs into manufacturers and finished goods on to clients are both being severely disrupted by raw material shortages, port issues, COVID restrictions, post-Brexit difficulties and market forces as demand outstrips supply. Suppliers’ delivery times subsequently lengthened to one of the greatest extents on record, while input costs and selling prices both rose at unprecedented rates. With little sign of supply pressures receding, these price rises will become more visible to consumers.” Back on the housing market boom... the Resolution Foundation flags up that prices are rising fastest in the less populated parts of the UK, confirming that the ‘race for space’ is happening. Resolution’s research, released last month, found that house prices in the least-densely populated areas of the UK have risen almost twice as much as those in the most-densely populated areas over the past year. Demand for rural properties, or those with a garden, have jumped during the lockdown and the move to more home working. Domino’s Pizza is aiming to hire 5,000 chefs and delivery drivers, as consumers’ appetite for takeaways remains strong, at a time when the hospitality industry is battling staff shortages. Britain’s biggest pizza delivery chain said it had recruited just over 8,000 people in 2020 to meet demand, including hairdressers, taxi drivers and event managers who were not able to work as usual during lockdown. However, as Covid restrictions ease, some of Domino’s pandemic recruits are returning to their previous roles. As a result, the chain needs more staff for its 1,100 UK branches, most of which are run by franchisees. The firm has previously announced plans to open a further 200 outlets. Domino’s search for new employees comes amid warnings from the hospitality industry that it is facing a staffing crisis, with businesses trying to fill thousands of vacancies. Domino’s was “overwhelmed by the response from people of all walks of life” during last year’s recruitment drive, said Nicola Frampton, operations director at Domino’s UK. Frampton added. “I’m proud we were able to play a part by offering people the opportunity to continue working and earning when times were tough. But as people start to reunite, customer demand is showing no signs of slowing and so we’re now looking for 5,000 new recruits.” Here’s the full story: UK sub-prime lender Amigo is facing insolvency after the UK high court rejected a controversial rescue plan last week. Amigo told the City this morning that it will not appeal the court’s ruling, which concluded that its proposal to cut compensation payouts to customers for mis-selling loans was unfair. Amigo added that its board are considering all options, including insolvency, saying: The Board of Amigo continues to consider all options, which includes insolvency, and whether it might be possible and appropriate, given the cost of a scheme, to promote another scheme of arrangement to avoid insolvency. The UK’s financial watchdog, the FCA, opposed the original scheme of arrangement proposed by Amigo, which charges 49.9% interest and requires borrowers to provide a friend or family member to act as a guarantor for a loan. Under the plan, the compensation pool for those missold loans was capped while directors could earn £7m in long-term bonuses. Gary Jennison, chief executive officer of Amigo, said today: “Without a scheme, Amigo faces insolvency as it will be unable to satisfy its customer compensation claims as well as meeting the legally binding funding obligations owed to its secured creditors. The Board is committed to finding the best solution it can for Amigo’s customers and other stakeholders and will be working with its stakeholders, including the FCA, to achieve that solution as quickly as it can.” Amigo shares are down 8% this morning at around 7.6p, near to its record lows, having halved last week after the court ruling. It floated on the stock market in 2018 at 275p... The FTSE 100 index has jumped 1% this morning, amid hopes of a strong recovery from the pandemic. The blue-chip FTSE 100 index is currently up 75 points to 7097 points, near to the pandemic highs hit last month, with almost every stock gaining ground. Mining companies are leading the risers, with iron ore jumping today amid reports that China could be relaxing recent restrictions on steelmakers in its Tangshan region. The weaker dollar is also pushing up commodity prices, boosting Anglo American (+4.5%), Rio Tinto (+4%), Glencore (+3.4%) and BHP Group (+3.4%). Housebuilders such as Persimmon (+2.4%), Barratt Development (+1.7%) and Taylor Wimpey (+1.2%) are also rallying, after Nationwide reported that house prices jumped sharply again in May. AJ Bell financial analyst Danni Hewson says: “Robust figures from the housing market lifted the housebuilding sector while miners were in demand as commodity prices resumed an upwards trajectory. “The FTSE’s rise was all the more impressive when you consider it came against the backdrop of a recovery-inspired rally in sterling. A strong pound dulls the relative worth of the overseas earnings which dominate the index. Europe’s Stoxx 600 share index has hit a new record high this morning, rising by over 0.8% to 450.79 points. The eurozone manufacturing PMI has hit a new record high, as factory activity surged and inflationary pressures build up. Data firm IHS Markit has reported that its eurozone manufacturing purchasing manager’s index, which tracks activity across the sector, hit 63.1 in May, up from April’s 62.9. That’s its highest reading since the survey began in 1997 (any reading over 50 shows growth). Firms reported a slight slowdown in output and new orders, but growth rates remained near the record levels set earlier this year. There was also a record deterioration in vendor delivery times, as suppliers struggled to meet demand, which pushed up raw materials costs and forced companies to hike their own prices. Markit says: On the price front, average input costs again rose substantially, with the rate of inflation hitting an unprecedented level in line with widespread product shortages. Boosted by strong market demand, manufacturers took advantage of improved pricing power by raising their own charges at the fastest rate in more than 18 years of data availability. Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit, says the data suggests the eurozone will grow strongly this summer, and also see a sharp rise in inflation: “Eurozone manufacturing continues to grow at a rate unprecedented in almost 24 years of survey history, the PMI breaking new records for a third month in a row. Surging output growth adds to signs that the economy is rebounding strongly in the second quarter. “However, May also saw record supply delays, which are constraining output growth and leaving firms unable to meet demand to a degree not previously witnessed by the survey In the financial markets, sterling has hit its highest level against the US dollar in three years. The pound traded as high as $1.4248 early this morning, its highest level since April 2018 (which was the highest since the 2016 EU referendum). This rally comes despite concerns about a potential third wave of Covid-19, due to rising cases of the new variant, called B.1.617.2, Bloomberg reports that traders are betting that the UK’s fast vaccine rollout will help the recovery gain traction: “The pound is favored because the progress of vaccination puts the U.K. closer to economic normalization than other countries,” said Toshiya Yamauchi, chief manager for foreign-exchange margin trading at Ueda Harlow Ltd. in Tokyo. “Sterling could climb toward $1.45.” Economic optimism has also lifted sterling recently, with consumer confidence strengthening, retail sales rising and company output picking up as lockdown restrictions were eased. Yesterday, the OECD predicted that the UK economy would expand by 7.2% this year, a strong bounceback, which would be the fastest since 1941. The dollar, though, has been pushed down by the huge US stimulus spending packages and the Federal Reserve’s pledge not to tighten monetary policy until it sees more progress on unemployment. Last week it hit a three-year low against China’s yuan, despite Beijing’s efforts to avoid its currency strengthening too quickly (which could hit export growth). The shortage of larger, more rural houses on the market is helping to push up prices strongly, says Nicky Stevenson, managing director at national estate agent group Fine &amp; Country.: “Many current buyers are those who delayed a move last year and would have been forgiven for thinking that competition would have cooled by now. Instead, they find themselves in an even tighter race as demand continues to outstrip supply. The buyers driving the market higher are still those looking for more space. Forever homes are still the order of the day and buyers are more than willing to do everything in their power to secure what they truly desire. “There just aren’t enough of these larger properties coming onto the market in the right areas and there’s no sign this imbalance is going to resolve itself in time to suppress strong growth over the summer.” But Guy Harrington, CEO of residential lender Glenhawk, predicts that the pace of growth will slow, especially if a third wave of Covid-19 cases hits the UK. “The disconnect between the UK housing market and economic reality appears as great as ever. Government stimulus has created a false sense of consumer confidence. Iain McKenzie, CEO of The Guild of Property Professionals, says there’s a ‘frenzy’ in the housing market, with some buyers bolstered by lockdown savings: “At a time when much of the country seems to be enjoying a sense of normality once again, we would expect the property market to follow suit. Today’s figures show that the market didn’t get the memo. The frenzy to snap up a property at the tail end of a pandemic is showing no signs of stopping, with double digit growth in house prices throughout May - the highest we have seen in the best part of a decade. “The success of the stamp duty holiday has certainly played its part, as well as the savings many have made while working from home. “With a record-breaking new average house price, which has grown almost £24,000 over the past 12 months, it’s worth thinking about how your potential savings might not outweigh the inflated price of your new home. “It is still crucial that prospective buyers go into the process with a sound understanding of the market and what they want from a new property. “As demand in the market increases, the extra competition creates a fear of missing out that can distract buyers from the fundamentals. It’s important not to let the current property frenzy draw attention away from what you are really looking for.” Nationwide also predicts that house prices could “accelerate further” in the coming months. The ‘race for space’, record low interest rates, and the stamp duty holiday (which will fall from £500,000 to £250,000 at the end of June, and finish three months later) could all drive activity, making it even harder for first-time buyers to get onto the housing ladder. But the market could then slow, if the end of the furlough scheme pushed up unemployment. Chief economist Robert Gardner explains: “Housing market activity is likely to remain fairly buoyant over the next six months as a result of the stamp duty extension and additional support for the labour market included in the Budget, especially given continued low borrowing costs, improving credit availability and with many people still motivated to move as a result of changing housing preferences in the wake of the pandemic. “With the stock of homes on the market constrained, there is scope for annual house price growth to accelerate further in the coming months, especially given the low base for comparison in early summer last year. Further ahead, the outlook for the market is far more uncertain. If unemployment rises sharply towards the end of the year as most analysts expect, there is scope for activity to slow, perhaps sharply, though even this could potentially be offset by ongoing shifts in housing preferences, if current trends are maintained. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The UK housing boom continues to run, with house price inflation accelerating again as the pandemic spurs people to move to larger properties in more rural areas. Figures released by Nationwide this morning show that annual house price growth jumped to 10.9% in May, up from 7.1%/year in April, pushing the new average price to a new peak. It says: Annual house price growth rises to 10.9%, the highest level in nearly seven years Prices up 1.8% month-on-month, following a 2.3% rise in April New record average price of £242,832, up £23,930 over the past twelve months Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist, says the housing market has seen a “complete turnaround over the past twelve months” since the first lockdown temporarily froze the market, with transactions reaching a record high of 183,000 in March: Gardner adds that Nationwide’s research shows that pressure for more space, or a garden, is the primary factor driving the market this spring. “Amongst homeowners surveyed at the end of April that were either moving home or considering a move, more than two thirds (68%) said this would have been the case even if the stamp duty holiday had not been extended. It is shifting housing preferences which is continuing to drive activity, with people reassessing their needs in the wake of the pandemic. Nationwide says the ‘race for space’ continues to drive demand. Of those moving or considering a move, around a third (33%) were looking to move to a different area, while nearly 30% were doing so to access a garden or outdoor space more easily, according to an online survey of consumers. Gardner adds: “Over a third (36%) of those surveyed said they were more likely to consider enhancing their home as a result of Covid19, with nearly half (46%) of these looking to add or maximise space. Faster broadband was another factor, with the move to home working and home schooling during lockdown showing the value of a good web connection. Nationwide’s results will interest the Bank of England, which is carefully monitoring Britain’s booming housing market as it weighs up the possibility that a rapid recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic will lead to a sustained period of inflation. In an interview with the Guardian today, deputy governor Sir Dave Ramsden said the Bank expected price pressures to be temporary but he and his colleagues on Threadneedle Street’s monetary policy committee were aware of the risks. Ramsden, the deputy governor responsible for markets and banking, said: “There is a risk that demand gets ahead of supply and that will lead to a more generalised pick-up in inflationary pressure. That’s something we are absolutely going to guard against. We are looking carefully at the housing market and a raft of real-term indicators.” Also coming up today Surveys of factory purchasing managers in the eurozone, UK and US are expected to show strong growth last month, and squeezed supply chains pushing up prices. Oil ministers from the Opec+ group will hold a video call today to assess the latest developments in the global markets. They’re expected to stick to the existing pace of gradually easing oil supply curbs, as demand picks up -- which has already pushed UK petrol prices up for six months in a row. Crude prices have risen overnight, with Brent crude rising over $70 per barrel.

A key quality is that they resist change: they attempt to fix for us an abiding sense of what exactly has happened. They can be many things: columns, tombs, plaques, cenotaphs, village halls, even housing. But who are they for? The people who suffered, their families, the wider public or future generations?</p> <p>At some point, inevitably, there will be an official, national memorial of the pandemic in the UK (as well as many more, surely, at local and international levels). What, then, should it look like? It will have to contend with how messy the past year has been – the death, the sorrow, the fear, but also the ensuing political and social division. Perhaps through all of that, memorialisation can play a therapeutic role.</p> <p>Memorials naturally remove some of the complexity of the past, replacing it with something smoother, better suited to a broad audience: the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/from-the-archive-blog/2020/nov/10/the-funeral-of-the-unknown-warrior-november-920\">tomb of the Unknown Warrior</a> doesn’t address one specific loss, so it can talk of all loss. Because of this universal ambition it is vital public memorials hit the right tone – being both honest and broadly interpretable, tending to avoid friction. As a result, though, memorials can feel as if they don’t talk to you directly or seem too vague. But at a time when narratives are brutally contested, it seems unlikely that a pandemic memorial will avoid controversy, no matter how skilful the architect.</p> <p><strong>Read more here: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/01/what-should-britains-memorial-covid-pandemic-look-like\">Eddie Blake – What should Britain’s memorial to the Covid pandemic look like?</a></strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/01/what-should-britains-memorial-covid-pandemic-look-like\">What should Britain’s memorial to the Covid pandemic look like? | Eddie Blake</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60b5d8288f088d8c3178f3a9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-01T06:49:42.786Z\">7.49am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Prof Adam Finn, from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, is a second expert in the UK on the airwaves today warning against further easing of domestic restrictions on 21 June.

Huthi rebels, who control most of the country’s north including the capital Sanaa, have been blocking international efforts to supply Covid vaccines, Human Rights Watch said. The New York-based group accused Huthi leaders of suppressing information about both the dangers of Covid and the prevalence of the disease in territory under their control. “The deliberate decision of the Huthi authorities to keep the real number of cases of Covid-19 under wraps and their opposition to vaccines are putting Yemeni lives at risk,” said HRW’s deputy Middle East director Michael Page. “Pretending Covid-19 does not exist is not a mitigation strategy and will only lead to mass suffering. “Given the weakened healthcare system in Yemen, Huthi authorities should at least ensure transparency so that civilians living in their areas can understand the scale of the pandemic and facilitate an international vaccination plan that meets the needs on the ground.” AFP report that Yemen received 360,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine on 31 March, the first of 1.9 million doses to be delivered this year through the Covax programme for poorer countries. However, the rebels’ failure to cooperate with the World Health Organization and the Yemeni government has prevented any vaccines from reaching the north, HRW said citing a medical source with “direct knowledge of the circumstances”. As a result, vaccinations have only been occurring in the government-held south. HRW quoted Huthi officials as dismissing Covid-19 as a “conspiracy”. “America bears the primary responsibility for the Covid-19 epidemic,” it quoted rebel leader Abdul Malik al-Huthi, as saying in a televised speech last year. Heathrow airport in London has begun processing arrivals from red list countries in a dedicated terminal following concerns about them mixing with other passengers. Travellers arriving from red list nations on direct flights are being taken to Terminal 3. Russia has announced the resumption of air travel with Britain and a number of other countries – Austria, Hungary, Lebanon, Luxembourg, Croatia, Mauritius, and Morocco – which had been suspended due to coronavirus restrictions. Peru has revised its official Covid-19 death toll to 180,764, nearly triple the previous official figure of 69,342, following a government review that shows the severity of the outbreak in the country. The World Health Organisation has recommended a new set of names for the coronavirus “variants of concern”, which will be known by letters of the Greek alphabet. Alpha is the new name for UK/Kent (B.1.1.7), Beta for South Africa (B.1.351), Gamma for Brazil (P.1) and Delta for the variant first detected in India (B.1.617.2). Chinese authorities in Guangdong province have cancelled flights and locked down communities in response to what is believed to be the first community outbreak of the “Delta” or Indian variant in China. Malaysia has begun a tough nationwide lockdown to battle a worsening coronavirus outbreak. Of almost 2,800 deaths from Covid-19 recorded in the country of 32 million since the start of the pandemic, over 40 percent were in May alone. Taiwan has reported 13 new deaths from Covid-19, and 262 new cases. In a sign that authorities are also clearing the backlog of test results which had seen hundreds added to previous daily totals and caused difficulties in analysing any trends, there were just 65 new positive cases announced today. Germany’s Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious disease is to reduce the coronavirus risk level for the country to “high” from “very high”, health minister Jens Spahn said. A leading scientific adviser to the UK government has repeated calls to delay the 21 June lifting of restrictions by “a few weeks”, warning the coronavirus’s ability to adapt in the face of vaccines has still left the UK in a vulnerable position. Ireland will begin to gradually phase out temporary coronavirus-related jobless payments later this year while maintaining other income and business supports as the economy fully reopens, public expenditure minister Michael McGrath. Australians who have been vaccinated against Covid would be able to leave the country and return with less strict quarantine requirements under a plan that could be trialled within six weeks. Our community team are interested to hear about your experiences of travelling through Heathrow, now that London’s airport has opened up a terminal specifically to deal with arrivals from the so-called “red list” countries. If you’ve travelled and want to get in touch with them, you can find all the details here… Australians who have been vaccinated against Covid would be able to leave the country and return with less strict quarantine requirements under a plan that could be trialled within six weeks. The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, revealed the proposal in the Coalition party room on Tuesday following a question from Liberal MP Jason Falinski, who had asked whether vaccination could see people exempted from outbound and inbound travel restrictions. Australia shut its borders in March 2020 in response to the coronavirus pandemic imposing two weeks hotel quarantine on those arriving into the country. Outbound travel is also banned – which was upheld by the full federal court on Tuesday – although more than 140,000 Australian citizens and residents have travelled overseas for critical business, on compassionate grounds or for other exempted reasons. With Australia struggling to vaccinate its population by the end of 2021, there is pressure on the federal government to provide incentives to get the jab and to ease the travel ban that has separated families. About 40,000 Australians remain stranded overseas due to flight caps imposed as a result of limited hotel quarantine beds. Read more of Paul Karp’s report here: Trial allowing vaccinated Australians to travel overseas could start in six weeks This might be a useful ready-reckoner for some new language that you – and I – are going to need to get used to in the next few weeks, after the WHO recommended a new set of names for the coronavirus “variants of concern”. These are the four you need to know: Alpha - UK/Kent (B.1.1.7) Beta - South Africa (B.1.351) Gamma - Brazil (P.1) Delta - India (B.1.617.2) For ease of use to start with, I’ll try to make sure I am using all three ways of naming each variant until we all get more acquainted with the new terminology. There’s fuller details here: Covid-19 variants to be given Greek alphabet names to avoid stigma The proposed Copa América this summer is in some disarray, with reports that Brazil will replace hosts Argentina, just 13 days before it is due to start. “The Copa América 2021 will be played in Brazil,” an official Conmebol statement said. “Tournament start and end dates are confirmed. The venues and the fixtures will be announced by Conmebol in the next few hours.” The tournament, featuring 10 South American nations, had been due to be held in Argentina and Colombia with joint hosts for the first time in its 105-year history. Colombia was removed as a co-host on 20 May after a wave of protests demanding social and economic change spread across the country, and Argentina has followed. Now Reuters report that Chilean national soccer star Arturo Vidal has been diagnosed with Covid-19 and is in hospital in what appears to be a an isolated case as the squad readies itself for World Cup qualifying match against Argentina on 3 June. “He was diagnosed positive for Covid in the daily preventive exam performed today,” the team said in a statement late yesterday. The team plan to travel to Argentina for the game today. A quick Reuters snap here that Germany’s Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious disease is to reduce the coronavirus risk level for the country to “high” from “very high” as the situation improves, health minister Jens Spahn said on Tuesday. “We have grounds for optimism,” said Spahn at a news conference with the head of the RKI, Lothar Wieler, who said developments were improving but the pandemic was not yet over. Ireland will begin to gradually phase out temporary coronavirus-related jobless payments later this year while maintaining other income and business supports as the economy fully reopens, public expenditure minister Michael McGrath said today. Ireland is emerging from its third and longest lockdown having had one the strictest regimes in Europe for the last 15 months, leaving more than 300,000 people who lost their jobs claiming the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP). Local media reported that the PUP, which is paid out at a higher rate than regular jobless benefits, would be reduced from September and withdrawn by February 2022. “There won’t be a cliff edge in July, we will be looking at an extension of the PUP but also laying out a pathway towards the normalisation of our social welfare code and ultimately unwinding a payment that is pandemic related,” McGrath told national broadcaster RTE. “The changes will be gradual.” The number of people temporarily or permanently unemployed in Ireland stood at 22.4% at the end April, with around three in four on the PUP. McGrath said he expected that cohort to fall very significantly over coming weeks as the economy reopens. He added that additional supports for businesses reopening would be announced later today. Padraic Halpin reminds us for Reuters that the government allowed all shops to open for the first time this year two weeks ago with the hospitality sector to follow with limited capacity in coming days. Nicola Slawson has launched our UK live blog for the day, with the leads line being the warning that the country is in a “perilous moment”. Join her for the latest UK Covid news as it comes in today. I’ll be continuing here with the latest coronavirus news from around the world. Taiwan has reported 13 new deaths from Covid-19, and 262 new cases. In a sign that authorities are also clearing the backlog of test results which had seen hundreds added to previous daily totals and caused difficulties in analysing any trends, there were just 65 new positive cases announced today. The majority of the new cases remained in the north, with 166 in New Taipei city, 87 in Taipei city, and 23 in Taoyuan. Health and welfare minister Chen Shih-Chung said reinfection rates had declined thanks to the measures introduced over the past two weeks - and the community’s cooperation with them - but said it was still not time to relax. Chen the backlog of cases was expected to be cleared in the next day or two. The daily number of vaccinations has increased, but Taiwan still remains far behind other countries, with less than 2% of its population having received a shot. Taiwan’s problems with a Covid-19 vaccination drive are complicated, and involved accusations of geopolitical interference as well as of government bungling, but the important news from recent days is that the government is now allowing private companies, religious groups and local governments to arrange imports. Tech giant Foxconn and its billionaire founder Terry Gou have sought permission to buy 5 million vaccines from Germany’s BioNTech, to distribute among the general population. Gou said on Saturday they hope to airlift the shots from Germany to Taiwan without going via any middlemen. This has received a lukewarm reaction from the government. Chen expressed his gratitude to Gou and said the government was reviewing the application, adding that while it welcomes help in obtaining vaccines from companies and religious groups, Taiwan’s government has stipulated that only it can distribute the shots. Russia has announced the resumption of air travel with Britain and a number of other countries which had been suspended due to coronavirus restrictions. “Given the improvement of the epidemiological situation in the United Kingdom, a decision has been taken to resume regular air travel between Moscow and London from 2 June,” Russian health authorities said in a statement on Monday. Russia will also resume air travel with Austria, Hungary, Lebanon, Luxembourg, Croatia, Mauritius, and Morocco from 10 June, it said. Flights to Turkey, a major tourist destination for Russians, will remain suspended until at least 21 June. AFP note that since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, Russia’s borders have remained largely closed to foreigners. Heathrow has begun processing arrivals from red list countries in a dedicated terminal following concerns about them mixing with other passengers. Travellers arriving from red list nations on direct flights are being taken to Terminal 3. Passengers travelling to the UK on connecting flights from red list locations continue to transit through the airport alongside those from green and amber countries. The red list currently consists of 43 nations from which arrivals are deemed to present a high risk of importing coronavirus. Red list countries from where direct flights to the UK are permitted include India, the Philippines, Pakistan, Kenya and Bangladesh. Passengers arriving in the UK after being in one of those destinations during the previous 10 days must spend 11 nights in a quarantine hotel, costing 1,750 for solo travellers. The decision to separate arrivals on direct flights from red list destinations was welcomed by the GMB union, which had previously warned that “bottlenecks” are putting passengers and staff at risk. Heathrow insisted there were “several layers of protection to keep passengers and colleagues safe”, such as mandatory testing for all arrivals, segregation and ventilation. PA Media notes that an airport executive said in April that passengers are being forced to queue for up to six hours to be processed through immigration halls. It is the first time Terminal 3 has been used since April 2020, when it was closed to save costs amid the collapse in demand for travel. Heathrow plans to move its new facility for processing red list arrivals to Terminal 4 “as soon as operationally possible”. The pressure to get England’s Covid restrictions dropped on 21 June is coming from several quarters, not least those sectors of the hospitality industry that are still unable to open their doors. CEO of the Night Time Industries Association, Michael Kill, has been pushing for earlier clarification of when reopening might happen. He told Sky News: Nine out of 10 late-night businesses feel that veering off the roadmap would threaten their survival. Ninety-five per cent of businesses have already made financial commitments in terms of stock, staff and entertainment. So this is a key time, and the government really needs to step up and make it very clear exactly what their intentions are. The UK’s small businesses minister Paul Scully has been on LBC this morning reiterating the message from the government that people in the UK should use “caution” in the face of the growing number of cases of the “Delta” variant of coronavirus – the B.1.617.2 variant first detected in India. He stressed again that no decision would be taken until 14 June, saying: I know for some people that won’t be quick enough, but we’ve got to make sure that we are working with the latest data, accurate data. Scientists have to be able to go through this with a fine tooth comb, because it’s a really really important decision that affects so many people. Pressed about whether the country was in fact seeing increased hospitalisations and what the threat to the NHS currently was, he said: We’ve just got to make sure that we are looking forward to see what happens in the next few weeks and months in terms of that modelling, based on the data. Because what we do know is that when case rates go up, hospitalisations to date have also gone up. But the vaccination progress is still continuing with 63 million vaccinations and that is what is going to help us win this race. Eddie Blake writes for us this morning, asking what should Britain’s memorial to the Covid pandemic look like? Memorials aim to be an eloquent last word on an event. A key quality is that they resist change: they attempt to fix for us an abiding sense of what exactly has happened. They can be many things: columns, tombs, plaques, cenotaphs, village halls, even housing. But who are they for? The people who suffered, their families, the wider public or future generations? At some point, inevitably, there will be an official, national memorial of the pandemic in the UK (as well as many more, surely, at local and international levels). What, then, should it look like? It will have to contend with how messy the past year has been – the death, the sorrow, the fear, but also the ensuing political and social division. Perhaps through all of that, memorialisation can play a therapeutic role. Memorials naturally remove some of the complexity of the past, replacing it with something smoother, better suited to a broad audience: the tomb of the Unknown Warrior doesn’t address one specific loss, so it can talk of all loss. Because of this universal ambition it is vital public memorials hit the right tone – being both honest and broadly interpretable, tending to avoid friction. As a result, though, memorials can feel as if they don’t talk to you directly or seem too vague. But at a time when narratives are brutally contested, it seems unlikely that a pandemic memorial will avoid controversy, no matter how skilful the architect. Read more here: Eddie Blake – What should Britain’s memorial to the Covid pandemic look like? Prof Adam Finn, from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, is a second expert in the UK on the airwaves today warning against further easing of domestic restrictions on 21 June. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “There’s vulnerability across the country. The idea that somehow the job is done, is wrong. “We’ve still got a lot of people out there who’ve neither had this virus … nor yet been immunised, and that’s why we’re in a vulnerable position right now.” PA Media reports Finn added: “There are a lot of people who are very fed up about the idea of us even worrying about this. Since I’ve been saying in the last 24 hours that we should be cautious I’ve been getting lots of messages from people telling me to shut up basically. “But the truth is that a more infectious virus, which is what it looks like we’ve got, will reach people who are vulnerable – those who did not make a good response to the vaccine, those who have not yet had their doses – and that will be a problem for everyone because in the end it will be worse economically as well as for public health if we end up having to shut down again.” Chinese authorities in Guangdong province have cancelled flights and locked down communities in response to what is believed to be the first community outbreak of the “Delta” or Indian variant in China. Guangdong province had been reporting daily single figures of local cases, including asymptomatic cases, for more than a week, until the case load suddenly jumped to 23 on Monday, including three asymptomatic cases, and 11 on Tuesday. Most of Guandong’s cases are in the city of Guangzhou, with some in nearby Foshan, which has a population of 7.2 million. Authorities said all cases were found to be the strain commonly known as the Indian variant of the virus, now renamed by the WHO as the “Delta” variant. “In this race against the virus, we must run a bit ahead and run faster than before in order to block the spread of the virus and cut off the infection chain in time,” said Huang Guanglie, director of the Guangzhou municipal health commission. Guangzhou deputy mayor, Li Ming, said the strain had a short incubation period, a high viral load, and spread quickly. However she said that the trajectory was “under control”. In response hundreds of flights at the busy Guangdong Baiyun international airport have been cancelled, and authorities ordered some streets in the Liwan neighbourhood of Guangzhou city to isolate at home, with only one person per household allowed out to buy daily necessities. On Sunday, all 15.3 million Guangzhou residents were barred from leaving via bus, air or train without a green code on the health management app and a negative Covid test taken in the preceding 72 hours. Read more of Helen Davidson’s report here: China locks down part of Guangzhou amid outbreak of Indian Covid variant Malaysia has begun a tough nationwide lockdown to battle a worsening coronavirus outbreak, AFP reports, as countries across Southeast Asia struggle with a resurgence in cases driven by infectious variants. It writes, Much of the region escaped the pandemic’s first wave last year relatively unscathed by rapidly closing borders and introducing curbs. But countries from Thailand to Vietnam are being hammered by fresh surges, with efforts to quell outbreaks hampered by slow vaccine rollouts and populations weary of restrictions. Malaysia is among the worst hit. Of almost 2,800 deaths from Covid-19 recorded in the country of 32 million since the start of the pandemic, over 40 percent were in May alone. More than 570,000 infections have been reported, with a string of new daily records last week. As well as variants, the outbreak has been fanned by gatherings in the Muslim-majority country during the holy month of Ramadan and the Eid al-Fitr holiday, often in defiance of coronavirus rules. Under what authorities have termed a “total lockdown” in force from Tuesday, only essential businesses - such as supermarkets and medical clinics - can operate, people can only go outside for necessities, and most schools are closed. Travel between most parts of the country had already been banned for months. Just following up on Prof Ravi Gupta’s words there with a quick check on the UK government’s own coronavirus dashboard, and we can see that with data in from 31 May now, that the rolling seven-day averages of cases, deaths and hospitalisations are all up – all admittedly from a baseline much lower than was in the earlier peak of the second wave of the virus. You can have look for yourself here. A leading scientific adviser to the UK government has repeated calls to delay the 21 June lifting of restrictions by “a few weeks”, warning the coronavirus’s ability to adapt in the face of vaccines has still left the UK in a vulnerable position. Prof Ravi Gupta, a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), said the increased socialisation which has followed last month’s phase of restriction lifting could be expected to lead to “quite a lot” of hospital admissions. PA Media reports that he told ITV’s Good Morning Britain that while the nation had performed “amazingly well” in its vaccination programme, it was still too early “to put the vaccine straight up against the virus”. Gupta said a delay of a few weeks to the 21 June target could have a significant impact on Britain’s battle against the pandemic, and recommended it should be made clear to the public that it would be a temporary measure based on recent events, chiefly the emergence of the newly-designated “Delta variant”, which we had previously been calling the B.1.617.2 strain of the virus or the variant that was first detected in India. “Even a month delay could have a big impact on the eventual outcome of this,” said Prof Gupta. He continued: “As long as it’s clear to people this is not an unlimited extension of the lockdown but actually just a reassessment, that would be realistic. “Because we didn’t plan for the 617.2 variant when the initial roadmap was made, and actually things have gone really well except for the fact that we have this new variant to complicate things. “We must remember this is a virus that does adapt, and faced with vaccines it will eventually start to make mutations to avoid them even further, and then we could be in an even more precarious situation after that.” Vietnam is seeking to buy Covid-19 vaccine production technology and wants to build a plant to supply the Covax programme, Reuters reports, as the country tries to step up vaccinations to stem a new outbreak of infections. India and South Africa are among developing countries that have been pushing for an intellectual property waiver for Covid-19 vaccines. But even with a surprise US shift last month to support a waiver World Trade Organization talks on the issue on Monday failed to achieve a breakthrough. “Vietnam would build the plant and would like to receive the patent so it could supply vaccines to Covax, to other countries as well as to Vietnam,” the health ministry said in a statement, following a meeting with Covax representatives overnight. India has reported its lowest daily rise in new coronavirus infections since 8 April at 127,510 cases over the past 24 hours, while deaths rose by 2,795, Reuters reports. The South Asian nation’s tally of infections now stands at 28.2 million, while the death toll has reached 331,895, health ministry data showed. That’s it from me, Helen Livingstone, for today. I’m handing over to my colleague Martin Belam in London. Here’s a quick roundup of what’s been happening so far: Peru has revised its official Covid-19 death toll to 180,764, nearly triple the previous official figure of 69,342, following a government review that shows the severity of the outbreak in the country. As new coronavirus variants continue to be discovered, the World Health Organization has revealed new names, after the letters of the Greek alphabet, to simplify the discussion around the variants and avoid stigma. Australia’s drug regulator says it may refer anti-vaccination Facebook posts to federal police after anti-vaccine campaigners targeted an MP who posted about getting the jab. Australia’s federal court has rejected a bid by a rightwing thinktank to overturn the country’s ban on outbound travel. US gun sales spiked during the pandemic and continue to rise, with first-time buyers making up more than a fifth of those who purchased guns Germany has pledged to crack down on fraud in coronavirus test centres, after evidence that some have been claiming for more tests than they have carried out. Scientists are urging the government to speed up second doses of Covid vaccines and delay a decision on easing lockdown restrictions in England on 21 June in an effort to tackle the creeping spread of new cases. France has opened up vaccines to all adults a week before Germany, as Europe rushed to avoid another wave of infections caused by new virus variants. Vietnam has announced the suspension of incoming international flights to its capital and tightened restrictions in its biggest city. The inbound flight suspension to Hanoi will apply from 1-7 June. Travellers from the UK will have to provide “compelling reasons” to enter France from Monday, as French authorities tighten curbs to halt the spread of the Indian Covid variant. The European Commission has proposed that all EU countries gradually ease travel measures over the summer. School closures in England during the Covid lockdown badly damaged the mental health of mothers but had no impact on fathers’ wellbeing, research has found. Here’s a sobering, but important, feature by Guardian contributor V on the ways in which the pandemic has erased women’s rights and left them vulnerable to violence. She writes, All over the world, patriarchy has taken full advantage of the virus to reclaim power – on the one hand, escalating the danger and violence to women, and on the other, stepping in as their supposed controller and protector. And in more Australia-related Covid news, the country’s drug regulator is considering referring Covid vaccine misinformation posts to the federal police, after anti-vaccine campaigners targeted an MP who posted about getting the jab. In response to a viral post of Labor backbencher Julian Hill receiving his vaccine, numerous users posted false material purportedly from the Therapeutic Goods Administration wrongly claiming Covid-19 vaccines have caused more than 200 deaths. The figure they used was in fact the number of people who have died after receiving the vaccine, but apart from one case, none have been linked by the TGA to the vaccine. The TGA told Guardian Australia the alleged posting of the death counter was “particularly concerning” and it would consider referring it to the federal police. Australia’s federal court has rejected a bid by a rightwing thinktank to overturn the country’s ban on outbound travel. Libertyworks had argued that the health minister, Greg Hunt, has no power to impose a blanket rule stopping citizens from leaving the country. But Justices Anna Katzmann, Michael Wigney and Thomas Thawley dismissed the application and ordered Libertyworks to pay the commonwealth’s costs. The federal government had argued that, if successful, the case would have “driven a truck” through Hunt’s powers under the Biosecurity Act to impose measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19 during the global pandemic.

Peru has revised its official Covid-19 death toll to 180,764, nearly triple the previous official figure of 69,342, following a government review that shows the severity of the outbreak in the country. As new coronavirus variants continue to be discovered, the World Health Organisation has revealed new names, after the letters of the Greek alphabet, to simplify the discussion around the variants and avoid stigma. And Australia’s drug regulator says it may refer anti-vaccination Facebook posts to federal police after anti-vaccine campaigners targeted an MP who posted about getting the jab. Here’s a roundup of what’s been happening over the past 24 hours: US gun sales spiked during the pandemic and continue to rise, with first-time buyers making up more than a fifth of those who purchased guns Germany has pledged to crack down on fraud in coronavirus test centres, after evidence that some have been claiming for more tests than they have carried out. The EU, UK and Japan have continued to voice doubts at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) about a proposed intellectual property waiver on Covid-19 products such as vaccines Scientists are urging the government to speed up second doses of Covid vaccines and delay a decision on easing lockdown restrictions in England on 21 June in an effort to tackle the creeping spread of new cases. France has opened up vaccines to all adults a week before Germany, as Europe rushed to avoid another wave of infections caused by new virus variants.

Hunt told parliament on Tuesday he had misread information provided by the health department which had stated 20 sites were yet to receive a first dose of the vaccine. “I did make an error yesterday. My mistake. My apologies. Nobody else’s fault but mine,” Hunt said. “The department’s advice was correct and the misreading was my fault.” The correction came amid a fierce political row over the pace of the rollout with Labor blasting the coalition for its failure to vaccinate the aged care workforce and people living in disability care. Facing a grilling in Senate estimates, the aged care minister, Richard Colbeck, was also forced to admit the commonwealth did not know how many aged care workers had received the jab. Data collected from providers will be released on Friday for the first time. The shadow aged care minister, Clare O’Neil, said failing to know how many staff had been vaccinated in aged care facilities was “nothing short of gross incompetence”. Health officials confirmed on Tuesday that less than 10% of the 366,000 people employed in aged care had been vaccinated through the federal government’s “in-reach” vaccination program, but stressed the actual figure was likely higher because workers had received jabs through other channels. The revelation prompted a furious exchange with Labor senators Katy Gallagher and Murray Watt, who accused the government of shirking its responsibilities. “You fund it, you regulate it, how can it not be your job to ensure that the workers get the vaccine?” Watt said. Colbeck replied: “Because what you are proposing is not a natural step.” “We are working cooperatively with the states and territories on this rollout, it is a joint responsibility for us all to do so because there are a number of different channels in the way that people can access the vaccine,” the minister said. Colbeck said “every worker in aged care has access through those various channels now” but because the national immunisation register did not record a person’s employment, a new system was needed to report on the take-up rate. Aged care workers were among the 1A priority group supposed to be fully vaccinated within six weeks of the rollout commencing on 22 February. Asked on Tuesday if the federal government was responsible for vaccinating the workforce, Colbeck said it was “not a yes or no answer”. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, acknowledged in question time it was the commonwealth’s responsibility. “The government is indeed responsible for the national vaccination strategy, right across the country,” he said. “We are doing it in partnership with states and territories, of course we are, general practitioners and a whole range of others who are supporting these efforts.” The federal Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, said there were “real human consequences behind the government’s failure.” “It had two jobs this year.

And what we’ve seen in both those areas is absolute failure,” Albanese said. “The commonwealth government is responsible for aged care. The commonwealth government rollout of the vaccine in aged care facilities has been a debacle with human consequences.” Victoria announced on Tuesday that aged care and disability sector workers would be given priority access at state-run vaccination hubs from Wednesday as part of a five-day blitz aimed at boosting protection for the sector. The federal government has also asked its health advisory panel to examine making vaccines mandatory for workers – something it has previously advised against. Despite the delays and confusion surrounding the vaccine program, Colbeck insisted he was “comfortable” with the rollout that has seen 44,333 aged care residents receive a first dose and 25,319 of them a second dose too. For people living in disability care, just 355 – or about 1.6% – of more than 22,000 residents have received both doses. Colbeck defended the fact that just three of 13 proposed vaccine hubs had been set up, with all of them in NSW. Morrison was asked on Tuesday if he stood by remarks that Australia’s vaccination program was “not a race”. The PM replied in parliament that he was drawing on similar remarks from the then-chief health officer Prof Brendan Murphy. “I do stand behind my words. And my words were based on the expert advice of the chair of the scientific and technical advisory group,” Morrison said. Murphy said he had used the term in early 2020 to describe the fact that vaccine approval had not been fast-tracked in Australia. “We did take a deliberate decision not to rush the approval,” he said on Tuesday. “But once we’d gone through our normal proper TGA approvals our approach has been to roll it out as quickly as we can. It’s not a race in a sense that we’re not competing against anybody else. We are doing what we want to do now to protect the Australian community as quickly as possible.” Hunt said on Tuesday there was no evidence the Delta variant rendered vaccines less effective, however the chief medical officer, Prof Paul Kelly, told Senate estimates it was too early to know – with no real-world data or peer-reviewed laboratory evidence available yet. The federal treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, who has been on the back foot over federal financial assistance during his home state’s fourth lockdown, told MPs that the budget assumed there would continue to be outbreaks and lockdowns stemming from the virus, hence the decision to include $41bn in related economic support. “Victoria came to us to ask for assistance [but] because it was a short lockdown we said it was a scale that could be managed at a local level,” he told the party room. “They ran a pretty desperate attempt to smear us when in reality the numbers tell a very different story, Victoria has received more on a per capita basis than any other state.” The Victorian government has called the lack of additional federal assistance “disgraceful”.","charCount":"6209","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/sarah-martin\">Sarah Martin</a> and <a href=\"profile/paul-karp\">Paul Karp</a>"}]

Ross Peltier, 29, plays for the Doncaster Dons and has represented the Jamaica international team nine times. Peltier, who lives in the constituency in what he describes as a “humble terrace house”, said he had a “profile of sorts in an area which holds rugby league as its beating heart”. “I feel I can bridge the gap with the working person who has been a single party voter all his life to the Green Party”, he added. Batley and Spen is currently held by Labour, who have selected Kim Leadbeater, the sister of the area’s former MP Jo Cox. Tracy Brabin, who succeeded Cox after she was killed in 2016, was re-elected with a slim majority of 3,525 votes in 2019 and won the West Yorkshire mayoralty last month. The Greens came fifth in the 2019 election, with 1.3% of the vote. George Galloway, former MP for Bradford West and Bethnal Green and Bow, announced last week that he intends to stand with the Workers Party of Britain, stating his aim was to oust Keir Starmer as Labour leader. The Conservatives have selected Leeds councillor Ryan Stephenson as their candidate, the Yorkshire Party has chosen local engineer Corey Robinson and the Lib Dems, who came fourth at the last election, have selected TV producer Jo Conchie. Paul Halloran, an independent candidate who came third with 6,432 votes in 2019, has not yet confirmed whether he is standing. Last week he posted a photo of himself with actor Laurence Fox, who received 1.88% of the vote in London’s mayoral race. A group of police officers are being investigated by their force after being found at a party in contravention of Covid-19 rules. Police were called to the gathering at a property in Hove, East Sussex, on May 15, where the off-duty officers were found inside, PA news reports. A spokeswoman for Sussex Police said: Police officers were called to an address in Hove, following reports of a gathering inside on Saturday May 15 at 8.46pm. They entered and found a number of off-duty officers present. This incident, in breach of current lockdown restrictions, is being investigated by the force’s Professional Standards Department. Chief Superintendent Nick May said: We take Covid-related breaches very seriously and we are actively investigating this matter. The officers involved have not been suspended while the investigation continues. Matt Hancock said it was important to analyse the effects of the vaccine on cases of coronavirus and hospital admissions. The health secretary said at the press conference at the Jenner Institute in Oxford: What really matters and is hardest to judge right now is how much the vaccine has severed that link. I know that everyone was so glad about the data published yesterday, we had the first day in which no deaths were reported, but what the vaccine does is sever that link. That is its primary, not its only, but its primary job, and we watch that incredibly carefully. We know the vaccines work, the question is the degree to which they work and making sure we keep cases low enough so we can minimise hospitalisations as set out in the road map. We are vigilant and we look at it all the time. Asked by PA news agency whether vaccine passport plans for mass gathering are being scrapped, Matt Hancock said: One of the parts of step four is to set out four reviews, one of those is into certification. Being able to certify that you’ve had a vaccine is going to be necessary for international travel because some countries have already set out that they require proof that you’ve been vaccinated, and that means being able to prove with authority that you’ve had one of the jabs and confidence in which jab accepted for that proof - which is a matter for each individual country. We’ve provided the ability to show that through the NHS app, so we’re putting that certification in place where we know it will be needed. When it comes to using certification for domestic purposes, that is the review that Michael Gove is leading, and we’ll come forward with the conclusions of it soon. Asked if the government was considering keeping some restrictions such as mask wearing and work-from-home guidance after June 21, Matt Hancock said further decisions would be made in the coming weeks. He told a press conference at the Jenner Institute in Oxford: There is nothing in the data to suggest we are definitively off track but it is too early to make the decision about June 21, step four in the road map. We’ll make that decision based on more data in the next week to 10 days, ahead of June 14, as we’ve set out. The health secretary was asked after his speech about what happened in care homes at the start of the pandemic. He said: I think the best approach is to take responsibility for all things that have happened and, as Health Secretary, I do that for all the decisions I have been responsible for. The vaccine programme is an incredibly important programme that we’ve earned the lessons from in the same way that we’ve learned the lessons throughout the crisis - lessons for how best to protect people and we’ve updated the rules all the way through, and we’ve been very open about that. That’s a very important part about how you handle an unprecedented situation. The government has started commercial negotiations with AstraZeneca to secure a “variant vaccine” adapted to tackle the variant first identified in South Africa, Matt Hancock said. In a speech delivered at the Jenner Institute in Oxford, he said: There is yet more to do, the work isn’t over yet – we’re still procuring all the time and planning what we need to keep this country safe, including new vaccines specifically targeted at variants of concern. I can tell you today that we’ve started commercial negotiations with AstraZeneca to secure a variant vaccine – future supplies of the Oxford /AstraZeneca vaccine that have been adapted to tackle the B.1.351 variant first identified in South Africa. Once again, we’re leading the way and backing projects with potential, so we can keep our vaccination programme one step ahead of the virus and protect the progress that we’ve all made. Matt Hancock made a thinly-veiled dig at the SNP who want to break Scotland away from rest of the UK. Speaking at the Jenner Institute in Oxford ahead of the G7 health ministers’ meeting, the health secretary said the union has “saved lives” when rolling out the Covid vaccine. He noted that the country is “safer” as a result of the union. He told a press conference: We negotiated and bought vaccines for the whole country, we allocated them according to need and we worked with the NHS, devolved administrations and local councils everywhere, and we called upon the logistical heft of the British Armed Forces to help get them into arms. This didn’t happen by accident. The devolved administrations are run by different political parties and although health is devolved, the virus doesn’t respect political boundaries. I was determined to overcome political differences so we could deliver for citizens across the country wherever they live. He continued: Like everyone I have come to love Zoom, but it wasn’t easy getting this UK-wide approach and right at the start last March I went to see each of the devolved leaders face to face. It was so important that we got on the same page about the importance of this project. So although life was pretty hectic, last March I took 24 hours to fly to Edinburgh, to Belfast, to Cardiff. That 24 hours has proved invaluable in strengthening those relationships and it’s one of the most useful 24 hours in the pandemic, and since then we’ve had a call every single week, the four of us, and, frankly, sometimes it’s been like group therapy. Half a billion doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine have been released for supply globally, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said. Speaking at the Jenner Institute in Oxford, he said: The Oxford vaccine, developed by brilliant science here in Oxford, linked with AstraZeneca’s industrial might, backed by the support of the UK government, together, make it available at cost, this is in my view the greatest gift that this nation could give the world during this pandemic. A vaccine that’s available at cost – with no charge but intellectual property – and that because it can be stored simply offers hope for the developing world. So, as well as the money that we’ve donated – giving half a billion pounds to Covax (the global vaccine sharing facility) – we’ve also given the world the vaccine, which makes up 96% of those Covax doses. As of today, I can confirm that over half a billion doses of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine have now been released for supply globally, the majority of them in low and middle income countries. Matt Hancock said that Britons “love queuing” and there was “nothing more upsetting than people jumping the queue”. He also also talked about how Contagion, the 2011 American thriller film about the spread of a virus, inspired him to think of how important the vaccine rollout would be and how it was designed. Speaking at the Jenner Institute in Oxford, Hancock said: We started early on how we could make access to the vaccine fair. I know that a few eyebrows were raised when I said that the film Contagion shaped my thinking about our vaccine programme – I should reassure Sir John Bell that it wasn’t my primary source of advice – but when I watched that film, a penny did drop for me: not just that the vaccine would be our way out of the pandemic, but that the power of the vaccine would be so great that we would have to think very hard about who to protect and in what order. I knew that some of the most difficult moments of the pandemic would not be before the vaccine was approved, but afterwards when the scramble for vaccines have begun. He added: We Brits love queuing and there’s nothing more upsetting than someone jumping the queue. So, again, we started planning early to make sure that this was fair and we spent time preparing for how to organise the rollout in as fair a way as possible. The clinically advised prioritisation for getting vaccines in arms has been critical, I believe, in securing trust in the programme overall because it’s helped demonstrate that the system is fair. So, we acted early to reassure people that in the finest tradition of the values of the NHS, vaccines will be given according to need, not ability to pay – whether you’re the prime minister, or Premier League footballer or the future king of England. You have to wait your turn, just like everyone else. Speaking at the Jenner Institute in Oxford ahead of the G7 health ministers’ meeting, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said he had been told it would take at least five years to develop a coronavirus vaccine at the start of the pandemic. I specifically remember a then meek and timid professor turning to me when I asked how fast this could possibly be done. He said that if everything went right then the very best we could hope for would be 12 to 18 months. Who would have thought that just 11 months later we’d be the first country in the world with a clinically authorised vaccine and that professor Jonathan Van-Tam would be turning down Strictly. He also called Chris Whitty a “vaccine hero” in the speech. Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, has described the latest milestones in the vaccination rollout as an “incredible achievement”, with three-quarters of adults in the UK having received a first dose and 50% of adults in England having been given both jabs. He added: We know vaccines are breaking the chain between infection rates, hospital admissions and death. But we also know two doses are better than one, particularly in our fight against the Delta (India) variant. So while there’s a lot to celebrate, we’ve still got a way to go before people have had both jabs. We also know it takes three weeks for doses to be fully effective. We urge everyone to get their jabs when they’re offered them. A total of 39,585,665 first doses of the Covid-19 vaccines have now been delivered since the vaccination roll-out began almost six months ago. This is the equivalent of 75.2% of all people aged 18 and over, meaning three-quarters of adults in the UK are estimated to have received their first dose, PA Media reports. In Wales, 2,152,709 first doses have been given, the equivalent of 85.3% of the adult population. This is well ahead of the other three nations of the UK, with England on 74.7% (33,085,145 first doses), Scotland on 74.1% (3,286,261 first doses) and Northern Ireland on 73.1% (1,061,550 first doses). The latest figures have been published by the UK’s four health agencies. They also show that an estimated 49.5% of UK adults are now fully vaccinated against Covid-19, including half (50.0%) of adults in England. In Scotland 47.5% of adults are estimated to have received both doses, along with 46.5% in Northern Ireland and 45.1% in Wales. Boris Johnson said the government will have “no hesitation” in moving countries around the red, amber and green lists of travel restrictions. Asked whether there may be more countries added to the green list soon, where there are no requirements to quarantine on returning to the UK, the prime minister said: You’ve got to wait and see what the Joint Biosecurity Centre say and what the recommendations are about travel. We’re going to try ... to allow people to travel, as I know that many people want to, but we’ve got to be cautious and we’ve got to continue to put countries on the red list, on the amber list, when that is necessary. I want you to know we will have no hesitation in moving countries from the green list to the amber list to the red list, if we have to do so. The priority is to continue the vaccine rollout, to protect the people of this country. Three-quarters of adults in the UK are estimated to have received a first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, health agency figures show. UK Covid vaccine confidence has been “sky high” in Britain, according to the health secretary, Matt Hancock. Addressing the first ever Global Vaccine Confidence Summit, Hancock said: “Across the UK confidence in the vaccine programme has been sky high. “We continue to top the list of places where people are willing to take, or have taken, a Covid vaccine – around nine in 10 of us.” He added: “I am aware that this isn’t a vaccine world cup – different nations don’t compete for one prize, we know that when everyone is safe we’re all going to be the winners.” Hancock added that when vaccine confidence in one country “takes a hit” then “word can spread, fake news travels fast”. “Vaccine confidence is an international challenge and one that takes international action,” he added. “The speed of misinformation is a deadly threat.” Testing for Covid-19 will be stepped up in Blackburn with Darwen as health chiefs hope to control its rising infection rates “in the next week or so”, reports PA. The east Lancashire borough has recently overtaken Bolton as England’s top Covid hotspot area as cases rise in parts of the north-west region amid concerns over the spread of the Indian variant. The rate in Blackburn with Darwen stands at 436.2 cases per 100,000 people, with 653 new cases in the seven days to 28 May. This is up from 303.3 in the seven days to 21 May. People without symptoms who live, work or study in areas with BB1 and BB2 postcodes in Blackburn with Darwen are asked to take a Covid PCR test at any of its five new mobile testing units. Surge testing teams from the council are also knocking on doors in some areas of Blackburn to hand out PCR test kits, with staff returning later to collect. The borough’s director of public health, Prof Dominic Harrison, said: “We think that Blackburn with Darwen is around seven to 10 days behind Bolton in terms of rising rates, so it’s encouraging to see their infection rate starting to decline. With all of the engagement work and surge testing that we are doing in the areas of Blackburn where we first identified cases of the variant of concern, we are hopeful that in the next week or so we can take control of our case rates too.” However, the Blackburn MP Kate Hollern has called on the government to provide the increased numbers of doses required to halt the spread among 17 and 18-year-olds. Luke Sibieta, a research fellow at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, has criticised the government’s commitment to school catch-up funding, saying other countries were being “much more ambitious” than the UK. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Sibieta said: The £1.4bn announced today adds to the £1.7bn that has already been announced, making for a total of about £3.1bn on education catch-up. A lot of that now is focused on the national tutoring programme, which (Sir) Kevan Collins talked about as being quite an important part of education recovery but it is clearly a lot less than the £10-15 billion that Collins was proposing for a full-scale education recovery, which would incorporate much bigger elements. The Biden administration in the US has proposed about £1.22bn – about £1,600 per pupil, over five times more than we’re spending in the UK. The Netherlands is going even further and has allocated over €8bn, which amounts to over £2,500 per pupil, so there are countries around the world going much further and being much more ambitious.” Boris Johnson has said there is still “nothing in the data at the moment that means we cannot go ahead with step four” of lifting coronavirus restrictions. “But we’ve got to be so cautious,” the prime minister added, as he said infection rates were increasing. “We always knew that was going to happen,” he said, adding: “What we need to work out is to what extent the vaccination programme has protected enough of us, particularly the elderly and vulnerable, against a new surge, and there I’m afraid the data is still ambiguous. “The best the scientists can say at the moment is we just need to give it a little bit longer.” Lockdown reading has helped the Harry Potter publisher, Bloomsbury, to its third profit upgrade of the year after a 22% surge in annual pre-tax profits. The company said people had “rediscovered the joy of reading” during the coronavirus pandemic, pushing its sales 14% higher to £185m in the 12 months to the end of February. Bloomsbury performed significantly better than the wider UK publishing market, which recorded a 2% rise in sales during 2020, according to data from the Publishers Association. The company said fantasy, escapism, social inclusion and cookery all sold well during the pandemic. New bestsellers included two books by the American fantasy author Sarah J Maas about female warriors, including A Court of Silver Flames, as well as the fantasy novel Piranesi by the British author Susanna Clarke. Other bestsellers included Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People About Race by Reni Eddo-Lodge, and Humankind by Rutger Bregman. The Harry Potter books by JK Rowling continue to attract new readers, almost a quarter of a century after their first publication. Bloomsbury said sales of the series about the boy wizard rose 7% during the past year. The pandemic reignited many people’s interest in reading, said Bloomsbury’s chief executive, Nigel Newton, and he expects this to continue even as lockdown restrictions ease. He said in an interview on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: People have developed a new habit and one where they have rediscovered the joy of reading, and will cling on to that even as the clamour of other ways of spending their time re-emerge.

Many aviation workers experienced anxiety, stress and depression during Covid-19 lockdowns, but they report feeling discouraged from acknowledging problems or seeking help, creating potential safety hazards and health problems. The warning this week from the Lived Experience and Wellbeing Project – a Trinity College Dublin hub that studies aviation worker wellbeing and the impact on performance and flight safety – came as airlines across the world increase flights and start rehiring pilots and crew. A total of 1,841 flights were scheduled from UK airports to France, Spain, Italy and Greece for the two weeks from 17 May, a rise of more than 300% compared with the previous fortnight. Airlines in the US inaugurated hundreds of new routes last week. Aviation workers will welcome the chance to regain their salaries and reboot their careers, but survey data suggests many will feel depleted as they return to cockpits and cabins, said Paul Cullen, a commercial airline pilot and research associate with the Trinity College team. We can’t sweep this under the carpet or dress it up. The data says a certain number of pilots were struggling pre-Covid but they wouldn’t disclose a mental health issue to their employer because of the stigma and fear of losing their license and perhaps losing their salary. Just as airlines have procedures to ensure mothballed planes are airworthy, humans need attention too, said Cullen. “You need to do the same for the crew to make sure they’re airworthy.” Read the full story here: The Northern Ireland Public Prosecution Service has announced that no prosecutions are to be taken against Black Lives Matter demonstrators who participated in protests in the region when strict Covid-19 rules on public gatherings were in place. The prosecution service said it had decided not to prosecute 14 suspects reported for potential offences under Stormont’s coronavirus regulations, PA Media reports. The decisions relate to three protests last summer – two in Belfast and one in Derry. Prosecutors concluded that the test for prosecution was not met because the suspects would have been able to successfully argue a defence of reasonable excuse. Debate is continuing over whether the final stages of unlocking restrictions in England can go ahead on 21 June due to concerns over the spread of the Delta variant first identified in India. Downing Street has indicated that Boris Johnson still sees nothing in the data to suggest the plan will need to be delayed. A No 10 spokesman said: The prime minister has said on a number of occasions that we haven’t seen anything in the data but we will continue to look at the data, we will continue to look at the latest scientific evidence as we move through June towards June 21. Tuesday’s zero death tally is likely to feed into ministers’ considerations. They will also consider that the figure followed a bank holiday weekend, so there may be a delay in reporting of deaths. The NHS Confederation said the ONS figures, which show a 29% fall in coronavirus deaths from the previous week, were reassuring but “the race is not yet won”. Director of policy Dr Layla McCay said: Given predictions of a summer wave of infections, the government must now use all available data to consider carefully whether 21 June is the right date for lifting all restrictions. It is of real concern that cases are climbing quickly, and our members are increasingly worried that this will lead to more hospital admissions. The vaccination programme in England will be extended to all adults within weeks, while all those aged 18 and over in Wales and Northern Ireland are able to book their jabs. In Scotland over-18s are being invited to pre-register for a jab with appointments starting in mid-June. The UK as a whole is expected to hit another milestone of three-quarters of the adult population receiving their first Covid jab. Latest government data suggests more than 39.4 million people had received their first dose, equating to 74.9% of adults. Sir John Bell, regius professor of medicine at Oxford University, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that current figures “don’t look too intimidating” but they still need to “play out for a couple of weeks” before the government makes its final decision on whether the 21 June reopening can go ahead. He said: I think the gain now is, can we get more people vaccinated down into younger, younger age groups to try and stop more transmission. In Scotland, the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, paused plans to ease restrictions in much of the country. She announced on Tuesday that while parts of the country will move to Level 1 of the Scottish government’s restrictions from Saturday, much of the central belt including Edinburgh, Dundee and Glasgow will be kept in Level 2. Sturgeon said the country was still at a “delicate and fragile point” in the battle with the virus, in an announcement on restrictions which she described as a “mixed bag”. Scotland’s clinical director, Prof Jason Leitch, warned the Delta variant “is causing us some challenge and is spreading quicker than we hoped”. The £1.4bn announced for the post-pandemic catch-up programme for pupils in England is “pitiful” and a fraction of that committed by other countries to help children’s education, a school leaders’ union has said. Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, hit out at the government on Wednesday as it faced scrutiny over why the money is about a 10th of the £15bn total understood to have been recommended by the education recovery commissioner, Sir Kevan Collins. Barton said the government package was “dispiriting” and accused the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, of having lower ambitions for children than those of his union’s members. “It’s pretty pitiful, only yesterday we were hearing stories about extending the school day and even if some people disagreed with it, at least there was a sense of ‘let’s do something radical, let’s do something different’,” he told Sky News. “Today’s announcement essentially equates to £50 per head: you compare that with the USA which is putting £1,600 per head, per young person, or the Netherlands, £2,500 per head. So what is it about those children in the Netherlands or the USA that makes them worth more than our government seems to say? It’s time to stop the rhetoric I think and start the action on behalf of children and young people.” Read the full story here: A total of 153,229 deaths have now occurred in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate, the ONS said. The highest number of deaths to occur on a single day was 1,477 on 19 January, PA Media reports. During the first wave of the virus, the daily death toll peaked at 1,461 deaths on 8 April 2020. Hundreds of workers at the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency have launched fresh industrial action in a long-running dispute over Covid-related safety. Members of the Public and Commercial Services union at the DVLA site in Swansea went on strike on Wednesday until Saturday, PA Media reports. The union warned it was entering a new phase of “sustained and targeted” industrial unrest for months to come. The latest strike is the third time staff have walked out over demands for more safety measures. The DVLA insists it has done everything possible to keep workers safe and has followed official guidelines. The PCS general secretary, Mark Serwotka, said a deal was all but agreed to end the dispute, claiming it was suddenly withdrawn at the 11th hour without any explanation. He said: Through painstaking negotiation, our union and DVLA senior management were on the verge of agreeing a deal only for it to be scuppered at the last minute. We strongly suspect senior ministers at the Department for Transport have interfered with the progress we were making and want to make some kind of ideological stand against PCS. They have grossly underestimated the resolve of our members in DVLA and have only emboldened them to take targeted and sustained action in the months ahead until they win. PCS is fully prepared for months of strike action, and we urge the government to rethink its position. A DVLA spokesman said: It’s disappointing to see the Public and Commercial Services union not only choose to continue with industrial action when there are zero Covid cases at DVLA, but they are also specifically targeting areas of the organisation that will have the greatest negative impact on the public, including some of the more vulnerable people in society, just as restrictions are starting to ease. The DVLA has worked closely with Public Health Wales along with Swansea environmental health and the Health and Safety Executive who have conducted regular site visits and inspections and have repeatedly confirmed a high level of compliance with control measures. Millions of people right across the UK are relying on essential DVLA services and PCS’s demands will cause significant and unnecessary disruption to families and businesses, all at a time when they are most needed. During a series of interviews on Wednesday, Gavin Williamson struggled to explain the discrepancy between the announced government spending and that recommended by the education recovery commissioner, Sir Kevan Collins, who was appointed in February by Downing Street to lead efforts to make up for the damage done by the coronavirus pandemic, particularly to pupils from more deprived backgrounds. The education secretary was asked multiple times on Sky News about either the difference in the two sums or about the discussions with the Treasury about funding, and he declined to give a direct answer. The proportion of deaths involving coronavirus in England and Wales is at its lowest level for more than eight months, figures show. There were 9,860 deaths from all causes registered in the week ending 21 May, according to the Office for National Statistics. Of these, 1.1% (107 deaths) had “novel coronavirus” mentioned on the death certificate, PA news reports. The last time the proportion was so low was in the week ending 11 September, when the virus accounted for 1% of deaths. At the peak of the second wave, in the week ending 29 January, Covid-19 accounted for 45.7% of registered deaths. The latest figure is the lowest number of deaths involving coronavirus since the week ending 11 September, and a fall of 29% from the previous week. The prospect of care home workers being required to get vaccinated against Covid-19 has moved a step closer, with a crucial endorsement from the UK’s human rights watchdog. Ministers are considering changing the law to make vaccination a condition of deployment for people in some professions that come into regular close contact with elderly and vulnerable people at high risk from the coronavirus. In a report to the government seen by the Guardian, the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) said making vaccines compulsory for care home staff would be a “significant departure from current public health policy”. But it judged that ministers were “right to prioritise protection of the right to life for residents and staff” and said it would be reasonable for care home workers to need a jab “in order to work directly with older and disabled people, subject to some important safeguards”. The EHRC is also likely to make a similar recommendation about healthcare workers, after the vaccines minister, Nadhim Zahawi, suggested over the weekend that NHS staff could face mandatory jabs, too, as some patients were “being infected in hospital”. Zahawi said no decisions had been made yet, and stressed there was a precedent: surgeons were required to be vaccinated against hepatitis B. He added: It would be incumbent on any responsible government to have the debate, to do the thinking about how we go about protecting the most vulnerable by making sure that those who look after them are vaccinated. A government source said: “We think it would save lives.” Read the full story here: The shadow education secretary, Kate Green, has called for more support for extra-curricular activities in schools. Green told BBC Breakfast: What we’re proposing is that there should be a range of measures in a package of support for children and young people. Yes more time for small group tutoring and catching up on lost learning, but children can’t learn well if they’re worried, if they’re anxious, if they’re not having time to play and develop. So we’re also suggesting support for extra-curricular activities, play, drama, art and so on, and of course in putting in mental health support in schools. She added: Children need some time to relax and enjoy life, over the summer and into the new school year we think the important thing is to make sure the fabulous facilities that schools have, the sports fields, the art rooms, the music rooms and so on, can be used for out-of-school activities too. So we’re talking about school being open for longer but not for lots of extra formal learning, we don’t want children doing maths at five and six in the evening when they’re really tired. Pupils will be offered an extra 100m hours of tuition under post-pandemic catch-up plans unveiled today – but the government faced immediate criticism of the £1.4bn programme, with its own tsar warning “more will be needed”. After months of unprecedented school closures, £1.4bn will be spent on up to 6m sets of 15-hour tutoring courses for disadvantaged pupils as well as an expansion of an existing fund for helping 16- to 19-year-olds with subjects such as English and maths, the Department for Education said. There is also provision for extra training and support for teachers, and funding to allow some year 13 students to repeat their final year if it was badly affected by the pandemic. It gave no immediate verdict on mooted plans to extend school days by 30 minutes. This idea, criticised as misplaced by some teaching unions, will be the subject of a separate review due to report later in the year. On the new spending plans there was virtual unanimity from unions that the sums committed were insufficient, with the National Education Union calling them “inadequate and incomplete”. Perhaps even more damaging for ministers, the announced spend is about a 10th of the £15bn total understood to have been recommended by Sir Kevan Collins, who was appointed in February by Downing Street as the education recovery commissioner tasked with leading efforts to make up for the damage done by the coronavirus pandemic, particularly to pupils from more deprived backgrounds. Read the full story by my colleagues Peter Walker and Rachel Hall here: The £1.4bn announced for the catch-up programme for pupils in England is “pitiful”, a school leaders’ union has said. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), told Sky News: It’s pretty dispiriting, here I am as somebody who is leading a trade union, and for all my colleagues it feels this morning as if we have got higher ambitions for the nation’s children and young people than the education secretary. It’s pretty pitiful, only yesterday we were hearing stories about extending the school day and even if some people disagreed with it, at least there was a sense of ‘let’s do something radical, let’s do something different’. Today’s announcement essentially equates to 50 per head, you compare that with the USA which is putting 1,600 per head, per young person, or the Netherlands, 2,500 per head. So what is it about those children in the Netherlands or the USA that makes them worth more than our government seems to say? It’s time to stop the rhetoric I think and start the action on behalf of children and young people. A total of 107 deaths registered in England and Wales in the week ending 21 May mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate, according to the Office for National Statistics – the lowest number since the week ending September 11 2020. The figure is down 29% on the previous week. Around one in 91 (1.1%) deaths registered in the week to 21 May mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate. Education secretary Gavin Williamson said recording zero deaths from coronavirus on Tuesday was “promising” but urged the public not to be complacent. Speaking to LBC radio, he said: “It shows that the enormous sacrifices of the British people are starting to really deliver.” He said: The fact that the British people have gone out there with verve and gusto and actually got vaccinated when so many other nations have not had that same level of take-up is a real credit. It is promising what we’ve seen in terms of zero deaths but we can’t be complacent. We continue to be careful and we’ve got to make sure we continue to get vaccinated. Williamson added there was a sense in government that there had been “really promising progress” towards scrapping all restrictions on 21 June, adding: You’re right to say it is about data, not dates, but the vaccines are having an impact in terms of actually reducing transmission, reducing the number of people in hospital and it is these factors that are going to guide the decision. Cabinet minister Gavin Williamson suggested more money will be “required” as the government tackles lost pupil learning during the pandemic. Put to him that an extra £1.4bn amounted to £50 per pupil in England, the education secretary told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: It is quite unprecedented to be getting this quantum of money outside of a spending review. But what we decided we needed to do was deliver interventions and support and invest in children immediately – that’s why we’ve ... over the last few months announced a total of over £3bn in terms of targeted help for children. Asked whether the Department for Education had not announced longer learning hours – with catch-up tsar Sir Kevan Collins reportedly pushing for an additional 100 hours per pupil – due to a lack of extra funding, Williamson said: “I have no doubt that in order to deliver everything we have ambitions for, for our children, there will be more that is required.” The education secretary said he was “absolutely delighted with £1.4bn”, when asked whether he had wanted more financial investment from the Treasury for the coronavirus catch-up plans. Pressed further on LBC radio on whether he had requested an additional “£5-6bn”, Williamson said: It is incredibly tempting to get involved in divulging to you private conversations with the chancellor and the prime minister, but I’m going to possibly sidestep this one, if that’s OK?

They come over for two or three Tests, are unintentionally patronised whenever they win or lose, and then leave before the main event. This year, they are more like the complimentary bar snack you receive when your table is late. Their two-Test series against England isn’t even on the menu, also known in some cultures as <a href=\"https://www.icc-cricket.com/media-releases/742353\">the Future Tours Programme</a>; nor is it part of the next World Test Championship. And though this is 3rd v 2nd in the Test rankings, it is seen by most as a glorified warm-up for more important matches against the No1 side, India. New Zealand play them in the World Test Championship final later this month; England’s five-Test series kicks off in August.</p> <p>Test cricket may not yet have a second division, but it has multiple tiers. For a variety of reasons – the schedule, the FTP, the WTC, the IPL, the OCG – some games are bigger than others. England’s five Test series in 2021 could probably be split into three levels.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Tier 1</strong> Australia (A)</li> <li><strong>Tier 2</strong> India (A), India (H)</li> <li><strong>Tier 3</strong> Sri Lanka (A), New Zealand (H)</li> </ul> <p>There is a lot of sincere admiration for world cricket’s great overachievers (see, I’ve done it! I’ve patronised them without realising!) within English cricket. But there’s also a subconscious voice that will forever say, ‘<a href=\"https://talksport.com/football/415659/former-manchester-united-manager-sir-alex-fergusons-pre-match-team-talk-for-spurs-at-old-trafford-lads-its-tottenham/\">Lads, it’s New Zealand</a>’. On the face of it, this is another example of England telling New Zealand how great they are while simultaneously belitting them. But as Grady Tripp would say, it’s a little more <em>com</em>plicated than that. New Zealand will be back next summer for a more ostensibly meaningful series, albeit still as the warm-up act. These two Tests, added to the schedule at the last minute, are essentially a goodwill gesture to broadcasters.</p> <p>Money is the main motivation, there’s no point saying otherwise, but there is a bit more to it than that. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/may/26/england-second-test-against-new-zealand-to-have-18000-fans-edgbaston-cricket\">With the return of crowds at Lord’s and Edgbaston</a>, this series feels like a modern take on <a href=\"https://wisden.com/stories/how-the-1945-victory-tests-rekindled-crickets-competitive-spark\">the Victory Tests of 1945</a>. Let’s hope somebody catches the mood and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2004/oct/12/cricket\">plays like Keith Miller did then</a>. </p> <p>There are a few contenders, from Joe Root to the exciting debutant Devon Conway (<a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/player/devon-conway-379140\">check out these numbers</a>). For all the talk of England’s rotation, the standard of the cricket, especially the fast bowling, will be high. And this is not, as some have suggested, as England A team. They are missing only Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler and Jofra Archer from their best XI, if such a thing exists anymore, and Stokes and Archer are injured anyway. </p> <p>New Zealand are without Trent Boult because of his post-IPL isolation, yet they still have a brainy, brawny seam attack* of Tim Southee, Neil Wagner and the fascinating Kyle Jamieson. As bar snacks go, this is definitely more Hawksmoor than Jefferson Davis Wetherspoons.</p> <p><em>* Is that patronising as well?

Henry Nicholls calls a crazy single, if Wood had hit from mid-on he would have been trotting off with a flea in his ear. Conway settles things with four off the last two balls. 53rd over: New Zealand 146-3 (Conway 73, Nicholls 10) Robinson takes the post-tea ball and sends down five on the money. A sixth is clipped down to deep square for a couple by Conway. “There have been many comments about the heat on the OBO today,” sniffs Phil Keegan. “Well, just to put things in perspective, I am following from Hanoi where I have lived for a few years. The temperature the last few days has rarely dipped below 38 degrees, and the stifling humidity gives it a feels like factor of around 10 degrees more than that. I can’t walk my dog during the day as we would both likely keel over and die. Even my Vietnamese sweetheart is struggling with the weather. That’s heat folks.” Ah Phil, you’ve forgotten the weather wimpishness of the average Brit, blessed as we are by the modifying gulf stream. Personally, I melt once the mercury goes over 24 degrees. And according to my phone, it is 26 DEGREES in London right now. 52nd over: New Zealand 144-3 (Conway 71, Nicholls 10) Graham Thorpe walks round the boundary and has a long chat with Ollie Pope. Who know what wisdom he’s imparting. Broad throws himself through another probing over, just the one run from it when Conway manages to get hold of a short ball. That’s it, session complete! A very middle-session middle session: 59 runs and two wickets from it - the over rate an eyebrow-kinking 13.1. Hard work for both sides, who will run away after tea? Will Conway make a century on debut? Will Robinson run through the middle-order as he’s done to so many county sides? Come back in twenty minutes to find out. 51st over: New Zealand 142-3 (Conway 70, Nicholls 10) The penultimate over before tea, and Conway and Nicholls defend stoutly. No thought of whacking the part-time spinner dancing in their heads - perhaps Root’s pre-match kidology has foxed them. A couple of lbw shouts, but neither troubled the umpires. 50th over: New Zealand 142-3 (Conway 69, Nicholls 10) Broad, the pinkness of his face dulled by a sheen of suncream, has his hand on his hips at the end of his over. He accepts his floppy hat with a grimace of tiredness. A hundred percent pure effort topped off with a beauty last ball which nipped past Nicholls defending bat. “Hello.” Hello Tom van der Gucht ! “I seem to remember Aftab Habib was one of my go-to players on Michael Vaughan’s 2002 Cricket Manager. I had a technique of loading my team with not-quite International quality batsmen and all-rounder / dibbley-dobbley bowlers then dominating the County scene until the game crashed around 2019. Its gameplay reminded me of C64’s Rockstar Ate My Hamster in that it had a timeless quality, went in for eons without anything really happening, was remarkably repetitive and eventually just petered out into nothingness. In a strange way, my own real.life has begun paralleling this trajectory too.” 49th over: New Zealand 142-3 (Conway 69, Nicholls 10) Conway on-drives, deliciously, un-troubled by a gentle-looking Root off-break and it hurtles over the Lord’s green for four. Four more singles pinged through for an expensive over. 48th over: New Zealand 134-3 (Conway 63, Nicholls 8) Broad replaces Wood and is on the money immediately. He’s been bowling so well for Notts this season, and has just slipped back into that grove. In the crowd, a man in a strawberry-stripe blazer slurps a delicious looking glass of red. “Just back from a visit to Collyweston community shop to secure a supply of ice creams to get us through the pre and post tea sessions in the searing heat here in The Notswolds,” writes Kim Thonger. “Reminded me of selling ice creams at Somerset CCC festivals at Clarence Park, Weston-super-Mare in the late 60s/early 70s. At close of play the remaining dry ice, used to keep the ice creams solid in the wooden containers from which they were sold, was tipped into the nearest dustbin and the lid was replaced. Then we small boys would gather round to cheer when the lid was subsequently blown off by the dry ice. This was the nearest I ever got to a Chemistry O Level. The nicest thing was that the players often joined the dustbin audience and signed autographs while we all waited for the explosion. I doubt that anyone ever captured such antics on camera but if they did could they please share?” A niche request, but the OBO doesn’t usually let us down. 47th over: New Zealand 133-3 (Conway 62, Nicholls 8) Root’s overs are giving the other bowlers a chance to rest on a suncream hot day. They’ve not really had much of a time to acclimatise to these 20 degree pleasures after the frostiest April and the wettest May on record. Just a single to Conway who sees out five balls then knocks the sixth into the leg side for a single. 46th over: New Zealand 132-3 (Conway 61, Nicholls 8) A hardworking maiden from Wood, someone give him a rubdown with a damp towel or whatever it is they do to thoroughbreds after a race. “Re Richards email, I would say a crowd less Lord’s is one of the best crowd-less debut grounds, with the history and the long room, but it pales in comparison to many other grounds in the world for atmospheric openers. Not even the top 2 in England, below Headlingley and Edgbaston.” Lord’s is a special kind of atmosphere - if you like it proper and establishment-raucous. I’d throw in Old Trafford with a full Test crowd, or for a Roses T20 game, as a more pints and pie alternative. 45th over: New Zealand 132-3 (Conway 61, Nicholls 8) Root, long sleeves, slip of a boy, rubs the ball on his trousers and wheels in, twisting on his left foot pivot as he delivers. Largely unbothered, New Zealand pick four from the over. 44th over: New Zealand 128-3 (Conway 59, Nicholls 6) Mark Wood swaps ends to have a go from the Nursery End. The ball suddenly seems to misbehave, shooting through low before zipping through at helmet height. A slightly nervous Bracey fumbles with his glovework. 43rd over: New Zealand 127-3 (Conway 59, Nicholls 6) Talking of no front-line spinner, Joe Root has his first bowl of the Test, whizzing through an over while both batsmen pick up a single. 42nd over: New Zealand 125-3 (Conway 58, Nicholls 5) Robinson is a chunky guy, much more heavily built than the bamboo-svelte Broad or Anderson, and his boots will hack holes out of the the turf . The umpire seems to have a quiet word about his follow through but I didn’t spot a pencil or a notepad so I think it’s unofficial. “Summer feels like it’s really here, and with that the now annual moan… “taps Neil Harris. “What is going on with the over rate? Is anyone serious about doing anything about it….” It’s certainly going to be a problem for England in this Test with no front-line spinner. 41st over: New Zealand 124-3 (Conway 58, Nicholls 5) Mark Wood throws himself into another exhausting over on a warm day: four 94mph balls, one 95, one 93. Conway tries to turn the last off his hip, but misses. “A question for your Kiwi readers,” writes Richard Morris. “Of course Conway will be delighted to make 50 on debut, but genuine question - while doing it at Lords would be the extra thick Royal icing on the cake for any English player, is it the ‘best’ place for a New Zealander? or would it be more of a buzz to do it at Auckland or Canterbury? Actually - is that even true for English players? I suspect our Yorkshire brethren are throwing things at their screen and yelling Headingley, even as I type...” Duck, Richard! 40th over: New Zealand 120-3 (Conway 57, Nicholls 2) Thanks Rob, brilliant stuff as always. Robinson continues from the pavilion end - where lines and lines of empty white bucket seats sit. At least Taylor didn’t have to weave his way through an awkward silence when he walked back after his scratchy 14. Just three off the over, and an lbw shout against Nicholls that Robinson fancied but Root didn’t. Nicholls is not out! Yep, it pitched outside leg and England lose one of their three reviews. That was the last ball of the over, so it’s time for me to hand over to the great Tanya Aldred for the rest of the day. You can email her on tanya.aldred.freelance@theguardian.com. Cheerio! 39th over: New Zealand 117-3 (Conway 54, Nicholls 2) Wood has a big LBW shout against Nicholls turned down. It looked like it pitched well outside leg stump, but Joe Root has decided to review. I’ll be very surprised if this is out. 38th over: New Zealand 116-3 (Conway 53, Nicholls 2) The new batsman Henry Nicholls pushed his first ball past backward point for a couple. That’s plumb. Taylor falls over towards the off side and is trapped in front by a classic nipbacker. Beautifully done by Ollie Robinson, who has two for 20 and is making a really impressive debut. Taylor goes for an extremely scratchy 14. 37th over: New Zealand 114-2 (Conway 53, Taylor 14) With New Zealand starting to look more comfortable, Mark Wood is brought back into the attack. He starts the process of dragging Conway from his comfort zone with a lovely short ball that beats Conway’s attempted uppercut. A really good maiden from Wood. “Afternoon Rob,” says Andrew Benzeval. “All this talk of being old, and then you point out that LRPL Taylor is somehow 37 years old. That can’t possibly be right, unless I’m now in my early for- ah.” 36th over: New Zealand 114-2 (Conway 53, Taylor 13) England go up for a leg-side strangle when Conway flicks at Robinson, but it was an autopilot appeal, with precisely 0.00 per cent conviction. “Is there a batsman anywhere who is good as Ross Taylor is, who manages to look as scratchy as Ross Taylor does just now?” asks Max Bonnell. “If he goes on to make a score England will look back at his first 30 balls and wonder how they managed not to dismiss him.” This was one of the 48 gazillion things I loved about Kevin Pietersen. He could look Don Bradman and Alan Mullally, sometimes in the same over. 35th over: New Zealand 110-2 (Conway 51, Taylor 13) Conway reaches a superb debut fifty in an appropriate manner, driving Broad handsomely through extra cover for four. He has played that shot beautifully. It’s been a really impressive performance: 91 balls, six fours. 34th over: New Zealand 102-2 (Conway 47, Taylor 13) Ollie Robinson replaces Jimmy Anderson (11-2-31-1) and has a muted LBW shout against Taylor. The line was good but it was too high. Taylor then misses a cut at a big nipbacker that cramps him. That was a fine comeback over from Robinson, with no looseners in sight. 33rd over: New Zealand 102-2 (Conway 47, Taylor 13) “I went to school with Aftab,” says Mark Hooper. “My memory of his Test career was him being hyped up as the saviour of the England side, treated appalling and dropped after never being given a proper chance. It felt more like a collective failure of the selectors and management set-up than to blame a kid with no Test experience.” Yeah, barring exceptional circumstances nobody should only get two Tests. Though it’s no excuse, England were such a mess that summer – they had no coach, at least four captains and a selection policy that was inspired by childhood games of blind man’s buff. 32nd over: New Zealand 100-2 (Conway 46, Taylor 12) Taylor inside-edges Anderson to fine leg for a couple. Anderson throws his hands up in the air because he knows how close that was to an extremely good LBW shout. England would love to dismiss Taylor early, because if he gets in he can do all sorts of damage. When Anderson throws a tempter outside off stump, Taylor misses another booming drive - but then he shows his class with a graceful drive past mid-on for four. 31st over: New Zealand 92-2 (Conway 45, Taylor 5) Conway edges a drive at Broad on the bounce to third slip. They said it changes when the sun goes down around here, and the ball has nibbled a bit more since that happened 10-15 minutes ago. 30th over: New Zealand 91-2 (Conway 45, Taylor 4) “Afternoon, Rob,” says Richard O’Hagan. “David Bowden’s email (26th over) just sent me down the very short wormhole - more of a worm divot, really - of Aftab Habib’s Test career. I played in a charity game with him the week before his debut, in which he proved himself adept not only at dispatching Berkshire’s finest bowlers around the ground, but also at bowling with either arm and throwing the ball from behind his back. I have often wondered how he would’ve fared had he done some proper practice before the game - although his debut was a rare 1990s England victory, albeit a game that they somehow won after being 45 for seven in their first innings.” My memory of his debut is that it was signposted in the press well in advance, in a matter-of-fact way, even though he’d never been on an A tour and wasn’t in particularly good form at the start of the season. 29th over: New Zealand 91-2 (Conway 45, Taylor 4) Broad appeals unsuccesfully for LBW when Taylor falls over towards the off side. It looked like it was going down, though Joe Root did discuss a review before deciding against it. Two balls later, Taylor is beaten by a jaffa that straightens sharply. He’s beaten again, recklessly chasing a wide outswinger, and then again off the last ball. That was a quite majestic maiden over from Broad. 28th over: New Zealand 91-2 (Conway 45, Taylor 4) Conway, who has been quiet either side of lunch, drives Anderson for a single. The cheap wicket of Williamson is such a bonus for England, though they still have a lot of work to do as New Zealand bat very deep. Even the No11, Neil Wagner, has a highest Test score of 66. Jimmy Anderson, by the way, now has 615 Test wickets. He’s four behind Anil Kumble, who is No3 on the all-time list. 27th over: New Zealand 89-2 (Conway 44, Taylor 3) Broad returns to the attack, probably with Ross Taylor in mind - he has dismissed him 10 times in Test cricket, more than anyone else. England have only gone and looked at the data, haven’t they. Taylor is beaten by a good delivery and then signals to the balcony for some eye drops - either that or, as Bumble suggests on Sky, a glass of red wine. 26th over: New Zealand 87-2 (Conway 44, Taylor 1) Ross Taylor is the new batter, which means we have a 38-year-old bowling to a 37-year-old. There’s hope for us all some of you. “Hi Rob,” says David Bowden. “I suspect Robin Hazelhurst (12:39) has blocked out that 1999 series in terms of humiliations. I’d only just properly gotten into cricket on the back of the South Africa series &amp; the Channel 4 excitement, and that series was both a crash course and agonisingly drawn out education in Watching England In The Nineties. Have been full of love and admiration for New Zealand cricket ever since but I hope our brave boys today don’t forget they’re avenging the memories of poor cowering Chris Read, the vast batless plains around Aftab Habib’s off stump &amp; Peter Such’s battling 51-ball duck.” Great days. My abiding memory has four words and nine syllables: Caddick, Mullally, Tufnell, Giddins. That’s the seventh time he has dismissed Williamson in Test cricket, more than anyone else. It was a really good delivery from Anderson, which jagged back from a length. Williamson played a solid-looking defensive stroke, but he was a fraction too late and the ball deflected back onto the off stump. Jimmy Anderson gets Kane Williamson in the first over after lunch! The players are back out. The weather remains glorious, and there’s a century out there for someone. “I haven’t seen any of the Test so far, just followed it on the OBO,” says Steve Hudson. “You say Wood has averaged virtually 94mph today – that’s faster than I can ever remember an English bowler bowling before. Does it LOOK that quick? Or could it be that some speedguns tend to err on the speedy side of strictly accurate? I seem to remember a few years ago South African speedguns seemed to exaggerate all bowling speeds by a few mph.” It looks that quick, and it’s consistent with his speeds since he changed his run-up. I think the technology is pretty good these days. It’s certainly come a long way from the early speedgun that had Mark Ealham bowling faster than Wasim Akram at Lord’s in 1996. 25th over: New Zealand 85-1 (Conway 43, Williamson 13) Another yeasty over from Wood, a maiden to Williamson, takes us to lunch. It’s been a good morning for New Zealand, who won a decent toss and batted sensibly to reach 85 for one. The first session of the series was dominated by two debutants: Devon Conway played some stylish drives in his unbeaten 43, and Ollie Robinson picked up his first Test wicket when Tom Latham dragged on. See you in half an hour! 24th over: New Zealand 85-1 (Conway 43, Williamson 13) Anderson has another strangled shout for LBW against Conway. There was a late inside-edge, without which Conway would have been in big trouble. A maiden from Anderson, who has been as parsimonious as ever: 7-1-19-0. “Andrew Moore wants us not to create a narrative that doesn’t exist,” says Felix Wood. “The day he meets humans is going to be an upsetting one for him.” 23rd over: New Zealand 85-1 (Conway 43, Williamson 13) Williamson plays a slightly loose drive at Wood, which takes a thick edge and flies wide of the slips for four. Wood’s speeds this morning have been hella (that’s right) impressive: his fastest ball was 95.2mph, and his average speed is almost 94mph. 22nd over: New Zealand 81-1 (Conway 43, Williamson 9) With 15 minutes until lunch, James Anderson replaces Ollie Robinson (6-2-17-1). Anderson has a good record against Williamson; no bowler has dismissed him as often in Test cricket. Williamson, beaten by the second ball, flicks the third into the leg side for three. “Robinson has impressed on debut but I’ve been particularly struck by Conway, a really elegant left-hander with shades of Gower about him,” says Colum Fordham. “I realise this is a green strip, but I think England have missed a trick by not including Leach. The Kiwis have a very useful left-arm spinner in Santner and he may prove crucial as the test goes on.” Agreed. England do have Joe Root and Dan Lawrence, and they won’t be bowling last, but it was still a bit of a surprise. 21st over: New Zealand 76-1 (Conway 41, Williamson 6) Wood hits Conway on the arm again, this time from round the wicket, and then beats him with a trampolining lifter. This is excellent stuff from Wood, the hot hot heat that England have craved. Conway responds with a stylish flick-pull for four, albeit with the aid of a misfield from Crawley on the fence at midwicket. “As a Somerset fan, this is the worst possible scenario,” says Mark Hooper. “Leach and Overton constantly being called up for the Test squad but not playing - ditto Gregory &amp; Banton for the short-form squads - when we potentially have our best chance of winning the Championship.” I’m not sure how the bubbles will work this summer, particularly after 21st June, so it might not be too bad. You won’t see Leach but the others could be available. 20th over: New Zealand 72-1 (Conway 37, Williamson 6) Robinson to Williamson, round two. He continues to hammer a fifth-stump line, then starts to get closer as the over progresses. Williamson is slightly late on his defensive stroke to the fifth delivery, which prompts a few oohs and aash. Another maiden from Robinson, who has made an encouraging start. “Hi Rob,” says Robin Hazlehurst. “Maybe England fans are not as nervous or bothered about New Zealand as about Australia because we don’t have too many memories of being humiliated by them? Losing to them yes, but not that cringing despair that Australia have inflicted at times. Even if NZ win this series 2-0 and both Tests inside three days, it probably wouldn’t feel like a humiliation, because, y’know, circumstances.” 19th over: New Zealand 72-1 (Conway 37, Williamson 6) Conway thumps Wood past mid-off for four, a lovely drive and an impressive response to being hit at the end of Wood’s first over. Then Williamson gets his first boundary with a classy square drive. This being a day of the week, he looks in excellent touch. “A lot of people seem to be falling over themselves to claim how it is such an outrage that NZ are so underrated, yet most of the commentary and comment I have read has been about how good this side are,” says Andrew Moore. “Let’s not create a narrative that doesn’t exist.” As we discussed earlier, I think it’s mainly an unconscious thing. That’s what it makes interesting. 18th over: New Zealand 62-1 (Conway 32, Williamson 1) Williamson is beaten by a good delivery from Robinson that holds its line outside off stump. Robinson spoke about Plan A for Williamson before the game, and it’s clear he is trying to drag Williamson across his crease. He ends a terrific over, his first maiden, by beating Williamson again outside off stump. 17th over: New Zealand 62-1 (Conway 32, Williamson 1) Now then. It’s time for a change of pace, with Mark Wood replacing Stuart Broad (7-2-22-0). His first ball, timed at 91mph, is inside edged for a couple by Conway. A single brings the new batsman Kane Williamson on strike; he leans into his first ball and drops it for a single on the off side. A lively over from Wood ends with a 95mph bumper that thumps Conway on the arm. “There has been a lot of respect shown to NZ’s bowling attack, but not enough to the batting lineup,” says G Play. “Four guys averaging over 40, the best keeper batsman since Gilchrist, and the new Mike Hussey on debut.” I wouldn’t go that far, though I know what you mean. I think everyone knows about Williamson’s serene genius, but Latham and Watling in particular are a bit underrated. 16th over: New Zealand 58-1 (Conway 29, Williamson 0) That was the last ball of the over. It’s been a promising start from Robinson, whose height and seam movement make him an awkward customer. A first Test wicket for Ollie Robinson! Latham felt tentatively outside off stump and dragged the ball onto the stumps. I think he was unsettled by the previous delivery, which snapped sharply off the seam to beat the outside edge. 15th over: New Zealand 56-0 (Latham 22, Conway 28) Too straight from Broad, and Latham rolls the wrists to put him away for four. He’s a fine player, who averages 55 in his last 20 Tests, though he is beaten on the drive later in the over. After seven overs, it’s probably time for Broad to be replaced by Mark Wood. 14th over: New Zealand 51-0 (Latham 18, Conway 28) Conway drives Robinson pleasantly through mid-off for three to bring up an assured fifty partnership. At 29, Conway looks like he knows his game like the back of his bat. 13th over: New Zealand 47-0 (Latham 17, Conway 25) Latham rides a lifter from Broad and steers it to third man for his first boundary. That was a really accomplished stroke. As the clock ticks past midday, the camera cuts to a member in his egg and bacon tie, pouring some fizz into a metal beaker. It’s also time for the players to take drinks. “Enjoying the coverage of the Test and how Conway has looked so far,” says Ben Macintyre. “I noticed you mentioned that English coverage tends to patronise NZ to which I would like - having seen the side go to #1 in the world and soundly beat India at home as well as England - to add a contrarian view. Lads, it’s England.” I don’t think any reasonable England fan would have a problem with that, as there is a bit of Spursyness about most of our sports teams. What intrigues me about the patronising attitude towards New Zealand is that it’s almost entirely unconscious. It’s why most people at Lord’s were nowhere near as nervous before the World Cup final as they had been before the semi-final against Australia. 12th over: New Zealand 41-0 (Latham 11, Conway 25) A moment of fortune for Conway, who edges an expansive drive off Robinson for four. That could easily have gone to hand. Joe Root brings in a fourth slip as a result. “Morning Rob,” says Brian Withington. “Gary Naylor’s examples of named player exhortations had me reflexively reaching for one of my pre-penned homages to Paul Simon, ‘Fifty Ways to Lose Your Wicket’. This includes such lines as ‘Miss a straight ball, Paul’ and ‘Pad up and pray, Ray’. As followers of CCLive! will testify, there’s plenty more where that came from ...” Both above and below the line, that bloody county blog is in serious danger of giving the internet a good name. 11th over: New Zealand 35-0 (Latham 11, Conway 19) Broad changes ends to replace Anderson (5-0-14-0) and promptly beats Latham with a nice lifting delivery. The ball has gone past the edge a few times; even so, most of the early signs point to a day of hard yakka for England’s all-seam attack. “Have Leach and Overton been released to play for Somerset against Hampshire tomorrow?” says Sam Tarr. “Asking for a friend...” Arf. I assume not because of the Covid bubble, or whatever we’re supposed to call it now. I’ll be honest with you, I’ve completely lost track of what you can and can’t do, and I’m also getting a bit fed up of people gawping at me when I pick my nose in Tesco’s. A bit of privacy, please. 10th over: New Zealand 35-0 (Latham 11, Conway 19) The debutant Ollie Robinson replaces Broad (4-1-12-0). He has a lot going for him - height, seam movement, accuracy and aggression - and I can’t wait to see him in action. Robinson’s languid run-up and action remind me a bit of Derek Pringle, though Angus Fraser is the most common comparison. His first delivery is a no-ball, but his line and length are spot on from the start. Conway flicks off the pads for a couple and then fences a legcutter through gully for two more. 9th over: New Zealand 30-0 (Latham 11, Conway 15) There’s a strangled LBW shout when Anderson swings one back into Conway’s pads. It was comfortably missing leg stump. He switches around the wicket to Latham, who offers no stroke a delivery timed at 88mph. Anderson turns 39 next month and he’s still capable of bowling at 88mph. 8th over: New Zealand 29-0 (Latham 11, Conway 14) Nothing much is happening for England, though Broad in particular is persisting with an attacking length to the left-handers. He beats Latham, who upbraids himself for fishing well wide of off stump. “Why is Chris Broad officiating at this Test match when his son is playing in it?” asks Andrew Bell. They have stopped using neutral umpires and match referees because of Covid, and I think Chris Broad is the only English referee on the elite panel. He fined Stuart last summer. 7th over: New Zealand 29-0 (Latham 11, Conway 14) Conway gets four more, this time off Anderson, with a lovely extra cover drive. He hasn’t been watertight this morning, though, and an inside edge flies past leg stump off the next delivery. “Maybe a shout out for Holland vs Ireland being played today as part of the ICC Super League,” says Jerry Dawson. “For the first time ever, a cricket game is being broadcast live on Dutch TV. Though so far, not doing the Dutch team much good – they lost their first five wickets for 53.” 6th over: New Zealand 23-0 (Latham 10, Conway 9) Conway gets his first boundary with a crisp cover drive off Broad, and plays the shot again next ball for a couple. An affronted Broad responds with a sharp legcutter that beats the edge. Before the game, Simon Doull said Conway is New Zealand’s most exciting find since Kane Williamson. His career statistics are pretty spectacular. “Looking back on the coverage from the 2015 series, I see that the Lord’s Test was covered by our late, much missed, Dan Lucas,” says Simon Thomas. “What a joy his commentary was. So raising a glass to him this morning (if I wasn’t working).” It’s hard to believe he’s been gone almost five years. Never mind the cricket – there is so much great music that I want to play to him so that he can tell me how rubbish it is and how much of an old man I am. 5th over: New Zealand 16-0 (Latham 10, Conway 2) The pitch looks really good. There has been a bit of movement, swing rather than seam, but nothing to alarm Latham and Conway. Latham forces Anderson through mid-on for a couple, and that’s your lot. “Bit disappointing that Sky are playing a soundtrack from a village match under the pictures,” says Gary Naylor, “with lots of ‘C’mon lads’ and ‘Lovely stuff’. Surely if it were from the effects mics at Lord’s, we’d have ‘Execute your plans Stu’ and ‘Active rest at the end of the over Jimmy’.” 4th over: New Zealand 14-0 (Latham 8, Conway 2) It’s time for our first look at the debutant Devon Conway. He gets his first runs in Test cricket with a thick inside edge off Broad, who gets a bit greedy as a result and tries for the LBW next ball. Nice plan, shame about the execution: Broad strays onto the pads and the ball runs away for four leg-byes. 3rd over: New Zealand 8-0 (Latham 8, Conway 0) Burns saves a couple of good runs with a good stop at backward point, and then sprints back to stop a thick edge from Latham reaching the boundary. Anderson’s last delivery is a good one that snakes back to beat Latham on the inside. “I know it’s not the point you were making, but between your mention of bar snacks, the weather over the last few days, and the fact that Test Cricket Is Only Bleeding Happening, I cannot think of anywhere I’d rather be than sat in the Sand Bar in Tenby, with wasabi peas and a glass of beer,” hics Matt Dony. “Feels like summer.” Wasabi peas. I bet you take the Observer on a Sunday. (NB: clip contains East End language.) 2nd over: New Zealand 4-0 (Latham 4, Conway 0) Stuart Broad, who is vice-captain in this game, shares the new ball. He starts round the wicket to Latham, the angle that has brought him so much success against David Warner in particular. When he strays onto the pads, Latham puts him away behind square for a couple. A single off the last ball means the debutant Conway will have to wait a little longer to face his first ball in Test cricket. “Tremendous to hear that England are planning seven straight wins before the Ashes,” says Pete Salmon. “Is anyone running a book on when that will be put to one side. I’m going with tea on day two tomorrow. Prove me wrong Engurland!” 1st over: New Zealand 1-0 (Latham 1, Conway 0) James Anderson, the man with 614 Test wickets, takes the first over. There’s a little bit of swing to the left-handed Tom Latham, who survives an optimistic LBW appeal from the fifth ball. It pitched well outside leg. TMS link Thanks to Nick Wiltsher for doing the necessary. The players are applauded onto the field by other human beings. It’s such a thrill to have crowds back, especially in such glorious weather. “What is going on mate?” says Amod Paranjape. “Not a single mail of pessimism from the English supporters. Really.” ‘Lads, it’s New Zealand.’ “Interesting comment that England are only missing Stokes, Buttler and Archer from their ‘best XI’,” says Jonathan McKinley. “Which of the three chosen for this match would you replace? Crawley, Bracey and Wood? Presumably there would be room for Leach also (for Robinson?) in the right conditions. Or do we say goodbye to Broad?” So much depends on conditions and context, and the picture changes all the time. But if England were playing the first Ashes Test in Brisbane tomorrow, and everyone was fit, I think the team would be Burns, Sibley, Crawley, Root, Stokes, Pope, Buttler, Archer, Leach, Wood, Broad or Anderson. “I’m really looking forward to this series - especially as I have tickets for the Edgbaston Test - but I’m struggling to pick a winner,” writes Steven Pye. “Is it cowardly to sit on the fence and predict 1-1?” I’d prefer that to 0-1, which, as Steven writes here, was the score in 1986. “No Jack Leach, no specialist spinner?” says Henry Lubienski. “We’re moving into uncomfortable territory here. Either they’re completely daft or I’m completely daft. Could you (gently) offer a judgement?” Given the weather I would have played Leach, probably ahead of Robinson, but I can honestly see both sides. This fence gets more comfortable by the day. “Morning, Rob, and a fine one it is too, very suitable for the start of the summer proper,” writes John Starbuck. “I can’t help feeling that a preamble takes place just before a stroll around the ground but it’s still worth doing. Anyway, don’t worry about patronising people such as the Kiwis, since we all do it, even them. It must be in the game’s DNA to have encouraging appreciation of one’s opponents, at least in public. What happens in the dressing room tends to stay there, unless an injury occurs.” “Greetings from the Emerald Isle!” writes Séin Healy. “Giddy for what will be almost six months, of top-quality cricket, although the Ashes might impact my sleep (and drinking) plans over the festive period. I am sure may have asked already, but can you put the word out for the TMS overseas link please? They seem to have buried it even deeper in the depths of the interest these days for us wanting to listen in Ireland. Thanks a mill and enjoy the next five (probably three) days.” I think we might see a few more five-day Tests this summer, as England are apparently keen to play the long game in preparation for the Ashes. And this piece, from Tim de Lisle, has more good lines and observations than most writers manage in a calendar year. New Zealand’s last Test on this ground, six years ago, was a feelgood classic. Andrew Miller, Cricinfo UK editor and friend of the OBO, has written a belting piece on the significance of a magical match. Fantasy Cricket The nice folk on the county blog have set up a fantasy league for the T20 blast. If you want to join, click this little thing. The code is NEKVIVOO. Jack Leach has been omitted, a dubious decision though not a surprising one. There are three debutants: James Bracey, Ollie Robinson and the New Zealand opener Devon Conway. With New Zealand batting, all three will be front and centre this morning. England Burns, Sibley, Crawley, Root, Pope, Lawrence, Bracey (wk), Robinson, Wood, Broad, Anderson. New Zealand Latham, Conway, Williamson (c), Taylor, Nicholls, Watling (wk), de Grandhomme, Santner, Jamieson, Southee, Wagner. Joe Root says England would have batted as well, though he doesn’t seem too disappointed - there’s a decent amount of grass on the pitch so England have the chance to do some damage this morning. Kane Williamson says it looks a good pitch. They are playing a spinner, Mitch Santner, so bowling last in these conditions could be a decent advantage. There are plenty of interesting subplots in this game. Two, in particular, stand out. The six England batsmen not called Joe Root are battling for four places against India, and New Zealand want to improve their away record. Just playing away from home helps - this is only their third series since 2016. James Bracey and Ollie Robinson will make their Test debuts. It looks like England have omitted Jack Leach, which is a bit of a gamble given the glorious weather in north London. I’m really excited to see Robinson in particular. His record since the start of the 2018 season is outrageous: 195 wickets at 17.29. And he can bat. New Zealand are usually the hors d’oeuvre of the English summer. They come over for two or three Tests, are unintentionally patronised whenever they win or lose, and then leave before the main event. This year, they are more like the complimentary bar snack you receive when your table is late. Their two-Test series against England isn’t even on the menu, also known in some cultures as the Future Tours Programme; nor is it part of the next World Test Championship. And though this is 3rd v 2nd in the Test rankings, it is seen by most as a glorified warm-up for more important matches against the No1 side, India. New Zealand play them in the World Test Championship final later this month; England’s five-Test series kicks off in August. Test cricket may not yet have a second division, but it has multiple tiers. For a variety of reasons – the schedule, the FTP, the WTC, the IPL, the OCG – some games are bigger than others. England’s five Test series in 2021 could probably be split into three levels. Tier 1 Australia (A) Tier 2 India (A), India (H) Tier 3 Sri Lanka (A), New Zealand (H) There is a lot of sincere admiration for world cricket’s great overachievers (see, I’ve done it! I’ve patronised them without realising!) within English cricket. But there’s also a subconscious voice that will forever say, ‘Lads, it’s New Zealand’. On the face of it, this is another example of England telling New Zealand how great they are while simultaneously belitting them. But as Grady Tripp would say, it’s a little more complicated than that. New Zealand will be back next summer for a more ostensibly meaningful series, albeit still as the warm-up act. These two Tests, added to the schedule at the last minute, are essentially a goodwill gesture to broadcasters. Money is the main motivation, there’s no point saying otherwise, but there is a bit more to it than that. With the return of crowds at Lord’s and Edgbaston, this series feels like a modern take on the Victory Tests of 1945. Let’s hope somebody catches the mood and plays like Keith Miller did then. There are a few contenders, from Joe Root to the exciting debutant Devon Conway (check out these numbers). For all the talk of England’s rotation, the standard of the cricket, especially the fast bowling, will be high. And this is not, as some have suggested, as England A team. They are missing only Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler and Jofra Archer from their best XI, if such a thing exists anymore, and Stokes and Archer are injured anyway. New Zealand are without Trent Boult because of his post-IPL isolation, yet they still have a brainy, brawny seam attack* of Tim Southee, Neil Wagner and the fascinating Kyle Jamieson. As bar snacks go, this is definitely more Hawksmoor than Jefferson Davis Wetherspoons. * Is that patronising as well?

Meanwhile, the number of first-shot vaccine appointments has leveled off in recent weeks after a worrisome decline in the month leading up to the mask announcement. The New York Times explains: First, new Covid cases have continued to decline at virtually the same rate as during the month before the C.D.C. announcement, which came on May 13 ... Overall, daily new cases have fallen by almost 75 percent since mid-April and by more than 90 percent from the peak in January. ... On the other hand, the C.D.C.’s change has had a noticeable effect on behavior in a positive way. ... For the previous month, the number of daily shots in the U.S. had been falling, as the country began to run out of adults who were eager to be vaccinated. With a few days of the mask announcement, the decline leveled off. The White House shared the New York Times piece in an email with reporters, and Joe Biden will likely tout the encouraging trends when he delivers an update on vaccination efforts this afternoon. Donald Trump has shuttered the blog that he started less than a month ago, a senior adviser to the former president said. Jason Miller told CNBC that the page “From the Desk of Donald J. Trump” had been deleted from the former president’s website and “will not be returning”. “It was just auxiliary to the broader efforts we have and are working on,” Miller said in an email to CNBC. “Hoping to have more information on the broader efforts soon, but I do not have a precise awareness of timing.” The blog, which debuted last month, was a clear effort by Trump to amplify his message despite his social media bans, which were put in place after he incited the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol. However, the blog never gained much traction, in part because of readers’ inability to reply to Trump’s statements, as they would do on Twitter or Facebook. Twitter also suspended an account that pulled content from Trump’s blog, @DJTDesk, because the social media company said it violated the platform’s ban evasion policy. Portable microwave weapons capable of causing the mysterious spate of “Havana Syndrome” brain injuries in US diplomats and spies have been developed by several countries in recent years, according to leading American experts in the field. A US company also made the prototype of such a weapon for the marine corps in 2004. The weapon, codenamed Medusa, was intended to be small enough to fit in a car, and cause a “temporarily incapacitating effect” but “with a low probability of fatality or permanent injury”. There is no evidence that the research was taken beyond the prototype phase, and a report on that stage has been removed from a US navy website. Scientists with knowledge of the project said that ethical considerations preventing human experimentation contributed to the project being shelved – but they said such consideration had not hindered US adversaries, including Russia, and possibly China. “The state of that science has for the most part been, if not abandoned, pretty much left fallow in the United States – but it has not been fallow elsewhere,” said James Giordano, professor of neurology and ethics at Georgetown University Medical Center. In case you missed it last night: A Democratic candidate won the special election to fill Interior Secretary Deb Haaland’s open House seat. Democratic state legislator Melanie Stansbury defeated Republican state senator Mark Moores by about 25 points, delivering a resounding victory for Democrats after the party’s poor performance in a Texas special election last month. Delivering a victory speech in Albuquerque, Stansbury said, “This moment is not just about standing up, but about leaning into the moment and bringing fundamental change to our politics and to our country.” Stansbury’s win will help to slightly bolster Democrats’ very narrow majority in the House. Once Stansbury is seated to represent New Mexico’s 1st District, Democrats will have a 220-211 advantage over Republicans. The margin of Stansbury’s victory was also encouraging to Democrats, given that Joe Biden carried the New Mexico district by 23 points in November. Haaland also won reelection to her seat by 16 points last year. Stansbury’s ability to improve upon Biden and Haaland’s numbers gave some Democrats hope that they can hold off a wave of Republican victories in next year’s midterms. However, the midterms are still about a year and a half away, so time will tell. The Guardian’s Sam Levine reports: For nearly five months, Democrats in state legislatures across the country have been scraping to do everything they can to stop an unprecedented onslaught of new voting restrictions from Republicans. They have given searing speeches on the floors of state legislatures. They have supported protests and even gotten arrested demonstrating against the bills. They have filed lawsuits challenging new restrictions almost immediately after they were signed into law. But despite their efforts, Democrats have not been able to stop sweeping new voting restrictions from going into place in states such as Arizona, Georgia, Florida, Iowa and Montana, where Republicans have used their legislative majorities to ram through the bills. But late on Sunday night something different happened in Texas. With Republicans on the verge of passing one of the most restrictive new voting laws in the country, Democrats in the state house of representatives walked out of the legislature, denying Republicans a quorum and killing the legislation. Governor Greg Abbott has fumed over the development and has pledged to call a special session to pass the bill. Be sure to read the fine print on the Anheuser-Busch vaccine giveaway: only 200,000 participants will get money to buy a free round after the US hits Joe Biden’s vaccination goal. And it may be a round for one person, as the beer company is only giving winners a $5.00 virtual debit card to purchase an Anheuser-Busch product. Those who want the chance to win one of the debit cards will also have to create a My Cooler Rewards account and upload a “picture of your favorite place to grab a beer”. Joe Biden will also deliver an update this afternoon on his administration’s efforts to get Americans vaccinated against coronavirus. The speech comes one month before July 4, Biden’s deadline to get 70% of American adults at least partially vaccinated for US Independence Day. The president is expected to announce a new partnership between the White House and the beer company Anheuser-Busch to encourage Americans to get their vaccines. The CEO of Anheuser-Busch said in an announcement this morning that the company will “buy Americans 21+ a round of beer when we reach the White House goal”. “We pride ourselves on stepping up both in times of need and in times of great celebration, and the past year has been no different,” said CEO Michel Doukeris. “As we look ahead to brighter days with renewed optimism, we are proud to work alongside the White House to make a meaningful impact for our country, our communities and our consumers.” The “Let’s Grab A Beer” initiative is only the latest in a string of US efforts to incentivize vaccinations. Perhaps most notably, the state of Ohio has been distributing $1 million lottery prizes to a handful of new vaccine recipients. Greetings from Washington, live blog readers. Joe Biden will meet this afternoon with Shelley Moore Capito, the senator who has been leading the Republican team negotiating with the White House over a potential infrastructure bill. The meeting comes almost one week after Capito and her fellow Republicans introduced their latest counteroffer, which proposed spending $928 billion for infrastructure projects over the next eight years. That offer was still a far cry from what Biden has called for spending. Of the $928 billion in Republicans’ plan, only $257 billion is considered new money, while the rest was baselines spending, meaning the funds that were already going to be used on infrastructure projects over the next eight years because of existing policies. In contrast, the president has proposed investing $1.7 trillion over baseline infrastructure spending, which is still less than the $2.25 trillion that he originally called for. So Democrats and Republicans remain miles apart on infrastructure, and Biden has signaled that he is ready for the negotiations to come to a close. “I told [Capito] we have to finish this really soon,” Biden said last Thursday. “We’re going to have to close this down soon.” The blog will have more details on the meeting coming up, so stay tuned.","charCount":"8790","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/joan-greve\">Joan E Greve</a> in Washington"},{"headline":"Coronavirus live news: German third Covid wave broken, expert says; EU confirms it will add Japan to safe travel list","standfirst":"<p>German medical institute says infections lower than any time since autumn 2020; EU ambassadors agree to add Japan to safe list</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jun/01/anthony-fauci-emails-covid-coronavirus\">Fauci emails lift lid on life in eye of the Covid storm</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jun/02/covid-cases-northern-california\">The California region where masks are taboo and cases are rising</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/jun/02/victoria-covid-update-melbourne-lockdown-extended-as-state-seeks-federal-payments-for-workers\">Melbourne lockdown extended as state seeks federal payments for workers</a><br></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/01/bolsonaro-brazil-copa-america-hosting-pandemic-coronavirus\">‘Shameful’: Bolsonaro denounced for hosting Copa América</a></li></ul>","trailText":"German medical institute says infections lower than any time since autumn 2020; EU ambassadors agree to add Japan to safe list","byline":"Yohannes Lowe (now); Martin Belam and Helen Davidson (earlier)","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"42887a1f6eae77a91cb5a7f5e5dee35d5a36ffae\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/42887a1f6eae77a91cb5a7f5e5dee35d5a36ffae/1433_17_3768_2262/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Staff at empty Narita airport, east of Tokyo, Japan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Staff at empty Narita airport, east of Tokyo, Japan.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eugene Hoshiko/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure>","body":"<div id=\"block-60b79f768f082e80569f40af\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-02T15:12:06.152Z\">4.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Britain</strong> reported a further 4,330 cases of coronavirus and 12 more deaths within 28 days of a positive test, according to official data. <br>The total number of people to have received the first dose of a vaccine stood at 39,585,665, the figures showed.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-60b79dc88f082e80569f4089\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-02T15:04:28.863Z\">4.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Japan’s</strong> prime minister announced Wednesday an additional $800m contribution to the U.N.-backed initiative to provide COVID-19 vaccines to poor countries, a four-fold increase of Japanese funding for the COVAX program.<br><br>The pledge by prime minister Yoshihide Suga comes as his government attempts to accelerate vaccinations in Japan, one of the world’s least inoculated countries, only about 50 days before it hosts the Olympics amid a continuing surge in infections. <br><br>He spoke as Japan co-sponsored a fundraising event for COVAX with Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which helps run the program.

Agency (EMA) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/28/covid-german-children-12-16-pfizer-vaccine-next-month\">approved the use of Biontech/Pfizer in children aged 12 to 15 on Friday</a>, and the government has also given the green light for its use from 7 June, the standing committee on vaccination, Stiko, which reports to the ministry of health, has still to make its recommendation.</p> \n  <p>The chair of Stiko, Thomas Mertens, has urged people to be patient, telling a <a href=\"https://www.ndr.de/nachrichten/info/podcast4684.html\">weekly podcast </a>dedicated to coronavirus developments, now on its 91st episode, that the vaccine is “no liquorice sweet” but a medical intervention.</p> \n  <p>“The decision as to whether Stiko recommends that all children between the ages of 12 and 16 be vaccinated against coronavirus must be based only on the best available evidence basis,” he said. </p> \n  <p>He stressed however, that Stiko would recommend the use of the vaccine on children with pre-existing conditions. </p> \n  <p>Mertens said the data provided by the vaccine makers resulting from their clinical studies of the mRNA vaccine were so far insufficient to recommend its use on all children. </p> \n  <p>“The number of vaccinated children in the study is simply too small in order to be able to make a reliable statement about its safety in this age group.” </p> \n  <p>Out of 1,100 children who took part in the study, about 14 of them suffered a severe reaction. </p> \n  <p>Mertens said other factors had to be taken into account when deciding whether to recommend the jab, such as a child’s risk of getting sick without a vaccine, as well as the question of herd immunity in the wider population. </p> \n  <p>Mertens said the decision was not an easy one, despite the millions of children who have already been vaccinated in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news\">US</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel\">Israel</a>. </p> \n  <p>“It’s not like offering the children a liquorice sweet,” he said. “This is a medical intervention”. </p> \n  <p>He added it

<div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/germany\">Germany</a> </strong>is slowly beginning to open up again with the government’s disease control agency, the Robert Koch Institute confirming that a third wave of the virus has been broken, and the number of new infections is lower than at any time since the autumn.</p> \n  <p>Almost a fifth of all Germans have now been fully vaccinated, and about 900,000 to 1m jabs are being administered every day.</p> \n  <p>But caution is being urged as virologists say until 70% of the population have received two jabs, the situation remains fragile.</p> \n  <p>Among the much-awaited restriction easing measures taking place in Berlin from Friday are the reopening of gyms and swimming pools as well as restaurants and bars, though establishments with service both inside and out will have to demand a negative result from customers if they wish to open both areas.</p> \n  <p>The obligation to make an appointment before going shopping, so-called “<em tabindex=\"-1\">Termin Shopping</em>”, will be dropped, though mask wearing will remain the rule, including on public transport.</p> \n  <p>Despite the fact that 500 people are now allowed to meet for cultural or sporting events in the open air, 100 inside, Stephan Hengst from the Berlin Music Commission has criticised the suddenness of the announcement, saying club operators and musicians have been given little notice to be able to organise events.</p> \n  <p>Companies must continue to allow their employees to work from home wherever possible which the German Trade Union Association, DGB, has insisted is necessary. </p> \n  <p>“As long as a majority of the population is not fully vaccinated, employers must not be allowed to shirk from their responsibilities,” the DGB’s head, Reiner Hoffmann, said.</p> \n  <p>But the head of the German Association of Employers (BDA), Steffen Kampeter, has insisted companies and employees should be relied upon to make the right decision as to whether they should return or not, with regular testing and the option to continue in home office necessary measures to help manage the coming weeks and months.</p> \n  <p>From Monday, about 6,000 company doctors are expected to boost the vaccine campaign when group prioritisation rules are lifted. </p> \n  <p>Having received an initial contingent of 700,000 doses, they have said they expect to be able to carry out around 5m vaccinations every month.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time

The total number of people to have received the first dose of a vaccine stood at 39,585,665, the figures showed. Japan’s prime minister announced Wednesday an additional $800m contribution to the U.N.-backed initiative to provide COVID-19 vaccines to poor countries, a four-fold increase of Japanese funding for the COVAX program. The pledge by prime minister Yoshihide Suga comes as his government attempts to accelerate vaccinations in Japan, one of the world’s least inoculated countries, only about 50 days before it hosts the Olympics amid a continuing surge in infections. He spoke as Japan co-sponsored a fundraising event for COVAX with Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which helps run the program. The program managers are seeking about $2bn more to reach a target of $8.3bn for its effort to fund free vaccines for low- and middle-income countries around the world. Global airline body IATA increased pressure on governments to ease travel restrictions on Wednesday, pointing to UK testing data that showed low incidence of Covid-19 in arriving passengers, Reuters reports. “These data tell us we can do better,” IATA Director General Willie Walsh said, citing a 2.2% positive rate among 365,895 tests carried out in February-May, according to the NHS figures. Germany plans to pay vaccine manufacturers an annual reservation fee to build up reserve capacity of around 600-700m doses per year to help it fight future pandemics, health minister Jens Spahn has said. The government plans to launch a call for tenders for so-called pandemic preparedness contracts with a five-year term so that vaccine doses “can be activated quickly if the worst comes to the worst,” Spahn told a news conference. Manufacturing setbacks and an over-reliance on EU approval for supplies slowed Germany’s rollout of Covid vaccines. It wants to boost domestic production to ensure it is not deprived of shots in future pandemics, Reuters reports. The stand-by contracts will help maintain know-how acquired during the pandemic so that next time “we don’t have to ramp up production from zero to 100,” Christoph Krupp, head of the vaccine production task force told reporters. “We want to bet on several companies and several vaccine types and not just one,” Krupp added. Reuters reports: Colombia on Wednesday began what its government called a gradual opening of its border with Venezuela after a 14-month closure intended to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Colombia, whose porous border with Venezuela extends roughly 1,380 miles (2,220km), has been the chief destination for Venezuelans fleeing their country’s social and economic crisis. The two countries do not maintain diplomatic relations. The gradual opening of river and land crossings was authorised starting at midnight on Wednesday, according to a resolution published by the Andean nation’s interior ministry. The interior ministry said biosecurity measures in light of the Covid-19 pandemic established by Colombia’s health ministry must be followed during crossings. Colombia closed its borders in March 2020. Rodrigo Duterte, president of the Philippines, has appealed to the public to get vaccinated against Covid-19, after data showed the government was far behind its immunisation targets, Reuters reports. In a televised address, Duterte said: I invite all our countrymen to be vaccinated at the earliest possible opportunity because this is the most, if not the only way, effective way, to defeat the Covid-19 pandemic. Let us all keep in mind that the vaccine will not only protect you from the virus, it will also protect your loved ones, especially the sick and elderly. John Wong, a data analyst on the government’s Covid taskforce, said that in the three months since early inoculations started, just 14% of senior citizens and 8% of people with health conditions had received first doses of a vaccine, short of the 21% target. Wong attributed the slow rollout to limited vaccine supplies, vaccine hesitancy and accessibility problems. As Reuters reports, the chairman of the Gavi vaccine alliance, Jose Manuel Barroso, has said that a pledging summit secured nearly $2.4bn, bringing total contributions nearly to $9.6bn for the Covax dose-sharing programme to buy vaccines and deliver them to poorer nations (see earlier post). Egypt aims to vaccinate 40% of its population against Covid-19 by the end of this year, the prime minister said in a televised address. By the end of Wednesday, 2.5 million people will have been vaccinated from a total of 6 million who signed up on the government’s registration platform, Reuters reported Mostafa Madbouly as saying. The first batch of locally made vaccines will be ready in July, Madbouly added. A debate over whether children in Germany should be vaccinated is showing no signs of letting up. Whilst the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved the use of Biontech/Pfizer in children aged 12 to 15 on Friday, and the government has also given the green light for its use from 7 June, the standing committee on vaccination, Stiko, which reports to the ministry of health, has still to make its recommendation. The chair of Stiko, Thomas Mertens, has urged people to be patient, telling a weekly podcast dedicated to coronavirus developments, now on its 91st episode, that the vaccine is “no liquorice sweet” but a medical intervention. “The decision as to whether Stiko recommends that all children between the ages of 12 and 16 be vaccinated against coronavirus must be based only on the best available evidence basis,” he said. He stressed however, that Stiko would recommend the use of the vaccine on children with pre-existing conditions. Mertens said the data provided by the vaccine makers resulting from their clinical studies of the mRNA vaccine were so far insufficient to recommend its use on all children. “The number of vaccinated children in the study is simply too small in order to be able to make a reliable statement about its safety in this age group.” Out of 1,100 children who took part in the study, about 14 of them suffered a severe reaction. Mertens said other factors had to be taken into account when deciding whether to recommend the jab, such as a child’s risk of getting sick without a vaccine, as well as the question of herd immunity in the wider population. Mertens said the decision was not an easy one, despite the millions of children who have already been vaccinated in the US and Israel. “It’s not like offering the children a liquorice sweet,” he said. “This is a medical intervention”. He added it was extremely rare for children to have a severe bout of coronavirus and that also had to be part of the equation. The European budget airline Wizz Air plunged to a €576m annual loss as it warned 2021 would be a “transition year” with further losses to come until travel restrictions are fully lifted. The carrier’s revenue slumped by 73% in the 12 months to the end of March, the period covering the first year of Covid-19, and it carried 10m passengers, a 75% fall compared with a year earlier. The airline said it had carried more than 830,000 passengers in May, while its planes were two-thirds full. József Váradi, the chief executive, said: We expect [this] to be a transition year where we will experience a slow but gradual recovery, mostly subject to the pace of vaccinations globally including in Europe. You can read the latest by my colleague Joanna Partridge here: Australia and European countries have announced fresh contributions to the Covax doses-sharing mechanism, in an attempt to widen vaccination of people in low and middle income countries. Australian prime minister Scott Morrison said that his country was making a further $50m donation to the Gavi vaccine alliance’s Covax facility, bringing its total to $130m. Pedro Sánchez, Spain’s prime minister, who announced a donation of 15m doses and $61m, said: “Only by leading by example we will be effective in preaching solidarity.” Sweden, Austria and Luxembourg were among other countries to also announce new donations, Reuters notes. Germany is slowly beginning to open up again with the government’s disease control agency, the Robert Koch Institute confirming that a third wave of the virus has been broken, and the number of new infections is lower than at any time since the autumn. Almost a fifth of all Germans have now been fully vaccinated, and about 900,000 to 1m jabs are being administered every day. But caution is being urged as virologists say until 70% of the population have received two jabs, the situation remains fragile. Among the much-awaited restriction easing measures taking place in Berlin from Friday are the reopening of gyms and swimming pools as well as restaurants and bars, though establishments with service both inside and out will have to demand a negative result from customers if they wish to open both areas. The obligation to make an appointment before going shopping, so-called “Termin Shopping”, will be dropped, though mask wearing will remain the rule, including on public transport. Despite the fact that 500 people are now allowed to meet for cultural or sporting events in the open air, 100 inside, Stephan Hengst from the Berlin Music Commission has criticised the suddenness of the announcement, saying club operators and musicians have been given little notice to be able to organise events. Companies must continue to allow their employees to work from home wherever possible which the German Trade Union Association, DGB, has insisted is necessary. “As long as a majority of the population is not fully vaccinated, employers must not be allowed to shirk from their responsibilities,” the DGB’s head, Reiner Hoffmann, said. But the head of the German Association of Employers (BDA), Steffen Kampeter, has insisted companies and employees should be relied upon to make the right decision as to whether they should return or not, with regular testing and the option to continue in home office necessary measures to help manage the coming weeks and months. From Monday, about 6,000 company doctors are expected to boost the vaccine campaign when group prioritisation rules are lifted. Having received an initial contingent of 700,000 doses, they have said they expect to be able to carry out around 5m vaccinations every month. EU governments have agreed to add Japan to their small list of countries from which they will allow non-essential travel, while holding off until at least mid-June for British tourists, EU sources have confirmed. Reuters reports: Ambassadors from the EU’s 27 countries approved the addition of Japan at a meeting on Wednesday, with the change to take effect in the coming days. EU countries are recommended gradually to lift travel restrictions for the current seven countries on the list- Australia, Israel, New Zealand, Rwanda, Singapore, South Korea and Thailand. Individual EU countries can still opt to demand a negative Covid-19 test or a period of quarantine. The EU last month eased criteria for adding new countries to the list, by changing to 75 from 25 the maximum number of new Covid-19 cases per 100,000 people in the previous 14 days. Britain met that revised target but was left off the list because of an increase in Covid-19 cases arising from an infectious coronavirus variant first identified in India. South Australian health authorities have warned AFL fans not to touch the ball if it flies into the crowd during Adelaide’s home game against Collingwood, sparking puns about possible “airborne transmission” of Covid. The Melbourne-based Magpies have been granted a special exemption to travel to South Australia for Saturday’s twilight clash with the Crows at Adelaide Oval, which has been operating with full-capacity crowds since early May. South Australia’s chief public health officer, Prof Nicola Spurrier, on Wednesday defended the decision to allow the team to visit despite the border being closed to Victoria amid the state’s growing Covid-19 cluster. Spurrier described the exemption as a “special situation”, saying the risk was “negligible” because the team was already in quarantine at home in Melbourne along with their families or housemates.

Its director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesuis, is speaking at the Gavi Covax summit. Vietnam’s health minister has said that Russia has agreed to provide it with 20m doses of its Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine this year, Reuters reports. The south-east Asian country approved the Russian vaccine in March but has stepped up its procurement push after being hit by its biggest outbreak so far, although its overall cases and fatality numbers remain relatively low. “Vietnam is trying to get access to Covid-19 vaccine sources to speed up its vaccination rollout at the earliest,” health minister Nguyen Thanh Long said in a statement announcing the Sputnik V agreement. At least 220 million people globally are expected to remain unemployed this year, well above pre-pandemic levels, with a weak labour market recovery exacerbating existing inequalities, the International Labour Organization (ILO) has said. The UN agency forecast the outlook improving to 205 million unemployed next year – still well above the 187 million recorded in 2019 before the onset of the pandemic, Reuters reports. According to ILO models, that equates to a global unemployment rate of 6.3% this year, falling to 5.7% next year but still up on the pre-pandemic rate of 5.4% in 2019. In a report, World Employment and Social Outlook: Trends 2021, the ILO said: Employment growth will be insufficient to make up for the losses suffered until at least 2023. Hello everyone, this is Yohannes Lowe. I’ll be running the blog until the evening (UK time). As always, feel free to get in touch on Twitter if you have any story tips. Checkpoints between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides of Cyprus are to reopen on Friday, the United Nations has said, marking the first time restrictions have been eased since December 2020 because of the pandemic. Cyprus is split between its Greek and Turkish Cypriot populations, with a number of designated checkpoints controlling movements between the north and south of the island. “The reopening of all crossing points will facilitate free movement, promote people to people contacts, build trust and have an overall positive socio-economic impact across the island for the benefit of all Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots,” the United Nations mission on Cyprus, UNFICYP, said in a statement. Reuters report that a committee of health experts from both sides would be assessing the situation on a bi-weekly basis. Vehicle and pedestrian crossings have been subject to on-and-off closures since February 2020, when the Greek Cypriot side shut the checkpoints for the first time in decades as a precaution to quell the spread of the virus. Under present circumstances, people who cross will require a seven-day negative antigen test or PCR test, the peacekeeping mission said. Rural northern California is seeing a troubling rise in Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations, an alarming trend that comes as residents and businesses continue to protest against safety measures and vaccinations – with one Mendocino cafe threatening to charge customers $5 for wearing a mask. While the region makes up a small proportion of the state’s population, the growth in its caseload has been considerable, and comes at a time when the state overall is enjoying some of the lowest rates of Covid in the country. After largely avoiding the worst of the pandemic, a block of far northern California counties now leads the state with nearly 40 cases per 100,000 residents over the past week, according to statistics maintained by the Los Angeles Times. Tehama county ranked the highest in the LA Times case ratings with 139 cases per 100,000 residents. Meanwhile 10 of the 21 total Covid deaths in nearby Siskiyou county have occurred since the beginning of May. The region has long been one of the most forceful in its pushback against measures such as masks, business restrictions and vaccine mandates – and the protests have only continued to gain steam. A cafe in the town of Mendocino made headlines after announcing it will charge customers a $5 fee if they order while wearing a mask. It also threatened to charge $5 to anyone “caught bragging about your vaccine”. “It’s about time the proponents of these ineffective government measures start paying for the collateral damage they have collectively caused,” the cafe owner Chris Castleman told NBC News. He also offered a 50% discount to customers who threw their masks in the trash. George Rutherford, a professor of epidemiology at the University of California, San Francisco, said the current situation feels inevitable. “I was waiting for this to happen,” he said, adding that the outbreaks mirror trends occurring in southern and eastern Oregon, just north of California’s border. “It shows you where vaccination is lagging and transmission is taking place.” Read more of Erin McCormick’s report from Berkeley: ‘Waiting to happen’: the California region where masks are taboo - and cases are rising The World Health Organization has approved the Sinovac Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use – the second Chinese vaccine to receive the WHO’s green light. The WHO said the emergency use listing gives countries, funders, procuring agencies and communities assurance that the vaccine has met international standards. Last month Sinopharm became the first Chinese vaccine to be approved by the WHO. The GAVI vaccine alliance is in talks with Sinovac to expand the Covax dose-sharing portfolio available to poor countries following the WHO approval. India has reported 132,788 new cases over the past 24 hours, and an additional 3,207 deaths. China has reported 24 new cases, including 10 domestic cases all in Guangdong province where authorities have imposed localised lockdown measures to control an outbreak. International flights to Vietnam’s two biggest cities are to resume, reversing a short-lived ban imposed over fears of a new coronavirus wave. AstraZeneca has said it would soon provide Thailand with 1.8m doses of locally manufactured Covid-19 vaccine, the first of multiple batches this month, just days out from the launch of its mass vaccination drive. Germany’s top diplomat in Taipei has said his government has been helping in talks between Taiwan and drugmaker BioNTech to supply Covid-19 vaccines, after Taiwan said a deal fell apart earlier this year due to Chinese “intervention”. Taiwan announced 372 new cases and 12 deaths in its latest daily update. Poland will raise the limit for the number of guests at large gatherings such as weddings to 150 from 50 from 6 June. People who have been vaccinated against the coronavirus will not be counted as part of this limit Russia’s single-dose Sputnik Light vaccine has been approved for use in Mauritius. Russia’s third vaccine, CoviVac, is more than 80% effective, according to preliminary data. Mexico has revised its death count, adding 4,272 fatalities. The clinical review of past deaths, by a team of doctors and nurses, is largely a record-keeping exercise. The Victorian government in Australia will now require people to check in at retail stores and supermarkets regardless of the length of time they spend in the store, as new data reveals a huge increase in check-ins to the Service Victoria app once the state forced businesses to begin using it. The Victorian government in Australia will now require people to check in at retail stores and supermarkets regardless of the length of time they spend in the store, as new data reveals a huge increase in check-ins to the Service Victoria app once the state forced businesses to begin using it. As part of the extension of the lockdown in Melbourne, the acting premier, James Merlino, announced on Wednesday that supermarkets and retailers would be required to make everyone check in when they entered into the store. Previously it was only a recommendation. After the state recorded a number of Covid-19 transmissions at retail stores where the contacts had “fleeting” contact, Victoria’s chief health officer, Prof Brett Sutton, said the change was to ensure records of everyone at potential exposure sites were complete. “We are in a position now where the Victorian community is motivated to do the right thing and they understand the importance of contact tracing in this space,” he said. “And even though we have been doing really well in identifying people at all exposure sites, I think everyone recognises that we have to do absolutely everything in our power to be able to chase down every single person who may be exposed because it is that one person who is not found who may be the one who spreads it.” The Victorian government launched its Covid QR-code check-in app, Service Victoria, at the end of November 2020 but continued to allow hospitality venues to to use their own QR-code systems to record people visiting. Read more of Josh Taylor’s report here: Victoria makes Covid check-in mandatory at shops after transmissions from ‘fleeting’ visits Drugmaker AstraZeneca has said it would soon provide Thailand with 1.8m doses of locally manufactured Covid-19 vaccine, the first of multiple batches this month, just days out from the launch of its mass vaccination drive. The announcement in a joint statement by AstraZeneca and Siam Bioscience, a firm owned by Thailand’s king, comes amid public anxiety about vaccine supplies, as the country suffers its most severe outbreak so far. The statement did not say whether the Thai plant would make all 6m doses that Thailand’s government has promised would be available this month. Reuters report that the government’s immunisation drive starts on Monday and relies almost entirely on its reserved 61m doses of AstraZeneca vaccine, the majority of which it said would come from Siam Bioscience, which is making vaccines for the first time. Questions about Siam Bioscience meeting production targets are sensitive because King Maha Vajiralongkorn is its sole owner. Insulting Thailand’s monarchy is a crime punishable by up to 15 years in prison. Thai health minister Anutin Charnvirakul said on Wednesday the promised 6m doses would come this month “as planned”, but did not specify delivery dates or how many would be sourced locally. “We will get AstraZeneca vaccine. It may come from wherever, but all AstraZeneca just the same. It could be made in Thailand or imported from overseas. It depends on AstraZeneca’s supply chain,” Anutin told reporters. A one-liner from Reuters here that Russia’s single-dose Sputnik Light vaccine against Covid-19 has been approved for use in Mauritius, Russia’s RDIF sovereign wealth fund, which markets the shot internationally, said today. Germany’s top diplomat in Taipei has said his government has been helping in talks between Taiwan and drugmaker BioNTech to supply Covid-19 vaccines, after Taiwan said a deal fell apart earlier this year due to Chinese “intervention”. China denied that accusation. But a war of words escalated after Taiwan rejected Beijing’s offer to supply it with shots made by Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group, which holds a contract to sell them in Greater China. In a Facebook post in Chinese on Wednesday, Thomas Prinz, Germany’s de facto ambassador to Taiwan, said they had “noticed the recent controversy regarding vaccine acquisition”. “Please believe that the German government, especially federal economy minister Altmaier himself, have made great efforts in the continuous communication and coordination between Taiwan and BioNTech,” he said, adding that whether a contract is eventually signed would depend on the two parties, report Reuters. “If the parties to the contract can reach a consensus, the federal government is naturally happy to see it happen.” Nicola Slawson has opened up our UK live blog for the day, which is immediately leading with the debate over the government’s plan for post-pandemic “catch-up” education provision in England. You can follow that with her here: I’ll be continuing here with the latest coronavirus developments from around the world. My colleague Frances Ryan writes for us this morning about how transformational being able to work from home has been life-changing for disabled people, and says don’t take it away now: At the start of the first lockdown, I reported that society was opening up to millions of disabled and chronically ill people as “virtual living” became the norm – from Zoom job interviews and streamed gigs and theatre to NHS phone appointments. But just as it took the non-disabled public to experience a dose of what disabled people have for years before access was improved, the fear is that any gains made during the pandemic will be discarded now that the wider public no longer need them themselves. Take work for example. The shift to working at home over the past year brought new opportunities to those previously excluded from the workforce. As one woman with agoraphobia told me: “Lockdown has opened my world” – it allowed her to get a job from her front room. But as ministers and some employers push for a return to the office, many disabled workers are worried their hard-won progress will go backwards. A research scientist with endometriosis and IBS told me her employer has already stopped letting her work from home full-time, even though her job can be done remotely. “The office is ‘going back to normal’ and they don’t want us at home even though I can do a better job [here],” she said. The Zoom pub quiz became a cliche of lockdown, but what many of us did informally with friends was also replicated by companies, with art exhibitions streaming online or bars running virtual club nights. As venues open back up, I’m hearing from scores of disabled people losing out.

The main Covid focus in England today hasn’t been the pandemic itself, but government proposals to help pupils “catch-up” on learning they may have missed. The package has been roundly criticised, as Haroon Siddique reports: The £1.4bn announced for the post-pandemic catch-up programme for pupils in England is “pitiful” and a fraction of that committed by other countries to help children’s education, a school leaders’ union has said. Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), hit out at the government on Wednesday as it faced scrutiny over why the money is about a 10th of the £15bn total understood to have been recommended by the education recovery commissioner, Sir Kevan Collins. Barton said the government package was “dispiriting” and accused the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, of having lower ambitions for children than those of his union’s members. “It’s pretty pitiful, only yesterday we were hearing stories about extending the school day and even if some people disagreed with it, at least there was a sense of ‘let’s do something radical, let’s do something different’,” he told Sky News. “Today’s announcement essentially equates to £50 per head, you compare that with the USA which is putting £1,600 per head, per young person, or the Netherlands, £2,500 per head. So what is it about those children in the Netherlands or the USA that makes them worth more than our government seems to say? It’s time to stop the rhetoric I think and start the action on behalf of children and young people.” During a series of interviews of Wednesday, Williamson struggled to explain the discrepancy between the announced government spending and that recommended by Collins, who was appointed in February by Downing Street to lead efforts to make up for the damage done by the coronavirus pandemic, particularly to pupils from more deprived backgrounds.

People who have been vaccinated against the coronavirus will not be counted as part of this limit, Reuters report that Adam Niedzielski told a news conference. Many countries in the world have been looking on enviously at the very small number of cases in Australia over recent months, but a new cluster has left people asking questions about the country’s approach. Michael Toole writes for us this morning: Just two weeks ago, Australians were living in a Covid-19-free environment that was unthinkable this time last year. Even in Melbourne, people were once again meeting family and friends at cafes, pubs and cinemas. Football games were played in front of packed stadiums. But that came to an abrupt halt when a new cluster of cases was identified in Melbourne early last week. This outbreak has now grown to 60 known cases across the greater metropolitan area, including several aged care workers and two residents. Genomic sequencing links all these cases to a man who was infected while staying in an Adelaide quarantine hotel. As Melbourne moves into a second week of lockdown, it’s worth asking why we’re back in this all too familiar situation. Two issues that loom the largest in explaining how we got here are a hotel quarantine system that clearly doesn’t work as well as it could, and a more concerning virus variant that seems to have taken full advantage of the time it circulated undetected from the Wollert man to case number five – the key piece of rotten luck in this outbreak. Add to that a painfully slow rollout of vaccines and, deeply worryingly, the related lack of attention to the safety of aged care home residents and staff.

I’m waiting to hear the starting gun International flights to Vietnam’s two biggest cities are to resume, AFP reports, reversing a short-lived ban imposed over fears of a new coronavirus wave. The Civil Aviation Administration of Vietnam on Monday announced a temporary suspension for international passenger arrivals at Hanoi’s Noi Bai airport from 1-7 June. A similar decision was in force for the airport in commercial capital Ho Chi Minh City until 14 June, as the country struggles to contain a virus outbreak in more than half of its territories. But today the aviation authority told airports and airlines that it had reversed the suspension, without mentioning a timeframe or giving an explanation. Vietnam has managed to keep infection rates low, but cases have more than doubled in the past month and now stand at more than 7,500, with 48 deaths. With less than two months left until the start of the Tokyo Olympic Games, Japan’s Asahi Breweries still doesn’t know whether fans will be allowed into stadiums to buy its beer. Japan has scaled back its Olympic plans amid the pandemic and a slow national vaccine rollout. Foreign spectators won’t be allowed in the country and organisers have yet to decide how many domestic spectators, if any, can attend. More than 60 Japanese companies together paid a record of more than $3bn to sponsor the Tokyo Games, an event most Japanese want cancelled or delayed again. Sponsors paid another $200m to extend contracts after the Games were delayed last year. Many are uncertain how to proceed with advertising campaigns or marketing events, according to 12 officials and sources at companies directly involved in sponsorship who spoke to Reuters. Asahi has the exclusive rights to sell beer, wine and non-alcoholic beer at the stadiums, but even if spectators are allowed, the Tokyo government has no plans to allow alcohol at its public viewing sites outside venues, a representative said. Sponsors have grown frustrated with what they see as slow decision-making and have complained to the organisers, Eimi Yamamitsu and Maki Shiraki report. “There are so many different scenarios that we can’t prepare,” said the source. Some domestic firms, worried about opposition to the Games, have called off plans for commercials featuring Olympic athletes or supporting Japanese national teams, said a person with direct knowledge of the matter. “I’m worried that by airing Olympic ads, it could be negative for the company,” said a source at a domestic sponsor. “At this point, no amount of publicity we could get would make up for what we paid.” Some top-tier global sponsors, whose contracts run until 2024, are scaling down Tokyo promotions and deferring budgets for Beijing in 2022 or Paris in 2024, said a second person with direct knowledge of the matter, and the employee of the sponsor company who was briefed on the issue. But domestic sponsors don’t have another Olympics. “That’s why we can’t simply quit,” said the source at the domestic sponsor. Bit of a reporting chain here, but Reuters is quoting Interfax saying that Russia’s third vaccine against Covid-19, CoviVac, is more than 80% effective according to preliminary data. The Chumakov Centre could produce six times more than the previously planned 10m doses of the vaccine a year, Interfax added. Australia’s Covid vaccination programme has lacked urgency at every stage, with the government forced to revise its own targets and never seeming to meet its own goals. Victoria’s latest outbreak has exposed Scott Morrison government’s failure to successfully get the vaccine out to even the most vulnerable in the community. The outbreak has hit unvaccinated aged care workers, despite federal promises they would be vaccinated by March. Along with mixed messages about the urgency of getting Australia vaccinated, the Morrison government became mired in a debate about whether Australia’s coronavirus vaccination rollout is or is not a race. Our multimedia team has put together this video report: Taiwan has announced 372 new cases of Covid-19 and 12 deaths in its latest daily update. The CECC also announced 177 cases across the preceding five days from the backlog of test results. The number is a significant increase from yesterday, when 262 new cases were reported, with just 65 from the backlog. The backlog is clearing, authorities have assured, but in the meantime it has continued to cause problems in analysis of trends and response measures. Health and welfare minister Chen Shih-Chung said it wasn’t clear if today’s rise was due to an increase in cases or faster reporting times, local media said. Chen also gave some updates about Taiwan’s vaccination process – a complicated issue, which involves accusations of geopolitical interference as well as of government bungling. The government has procured around 1m doses so far for 23.5 million people, and has ordered tens of millions more – a significant proportion of which are domestically produced vaccine candidates in trial stage. Chen told the media he hopes that once they have enough supply, they will be able to administer 1m doses per week, through Taiwan’s 300 hospitals, 800 clinics and 200 other locations. According to local media he said any businesses with more than 1,000 employees can host a vaccination stop. Chen said the government hopes to have 60% of the population receive at least one dose by October. It’s potentially a tall order, requiring about 14m doses. Currently Taiwan has received 850,000 doses, a mix of AstraZeneca and Moderna. It has ordered about 4.5m more from Moderna, 9.2m from Astrazeneca, and 4.7m via Covax, but the imminent arrival of any of these is far from confirmed given the aforementioned complications and global shortages. Another 10m have been ordered via two Taiwan producers, but these vaccines are still in trial stage. Producers have said they intend to apply for emergency use this month – international approval likely a long way after that. In the UK, Labour’s opposition spokesperson on education, Kate Green, has called for more support for extra-curricular activities in schools as part of the Covid catch-up package being proposed by the government. She told BBC Breakfast: “What we’re proposing is that there should be a range of measures in a package of support for children and young people. “Yes more time for small group tutoring and catching up on lost learning, but children can’t learn well if they’re worried, if they’re anxious, if they’re not having time to play and develop. “So we’re also suggesting support for extra-curricular activities, play, drama, art and so on, and of course in putting in mental health support in schools.” PA Media reports she added: “Children need some time to relax and enjoy life, over the summer and into the new school year we think the important thing is to make sure the fabulous facilities that schools have, the sports fields, the art rooms, the music rooms and so on, can be used for out-of-school activities too. “So we’re talking about school being open for longer but not for lots of extra formal learning, we don’t want children doing maths at five and six in the evening when they’re really tired.” Somewhere, someone in the UK government wrote “education” on their media grid for today, and so education minister Gavin Williamson has been sent out on the airwaves with details of plans to help pupils in the UK catch-up with schooling they may have missed during the pandemic. He has endured quite a torrid time in a somewhat bad-tempered appearance on Sky News, where at one point he was told that the presenter hates doing shouty, repetitive interviews, but that the minister just wasn’t answering the questions. In particular, he was pressed over the discrepancy between the money offered – £1.4bn – and the amount that catch-up tsar Sir Kevan Collins has said is needed to increase education opportunities – £15bn. PA Media quotes Williams as saying: “It is a lot of money and it builds on £1.7bn that we’ve already committed in terms of actually delivering for children – it is an extra 100m hours of tutoring. “It is making sure that children who need that help, who need that support, that we’re delivering that tutoring revolution to help them get it. “But we recognise it is part of a process. Over the past 12 months, we have already announced a previous £1.7bn worth of additional funding and we are looking at a whole raft of additional ideas for how we can continue to support our children, making sure none of them are left behind. “We have been working very closely with Sir Kevan Collins and actually the interventions around tutoring, driving up teaching quality, these are very much built on the work we’ve been doing together, recognising how incredibly important it is that we take on these interventions in order to help children.” There’s more detail on the government plans here from my colleagues Peter Walker and Rachel Hall, who write that: Pupils will be offered an extra 100m hours of tuition under post-pandemic catch-up plans unveiled today – but the government faced immediate criticism of the £1.4bn programme, with its own tsar warning “more will be needed”. After months of unprecedented school closures, £1.4bn will be spent on up to 6m sets of 15-hour tutoring courses for disadvantaged pupils as well as an expansion of an existing fund for helping 16- to 19-year-olds with subjects such as English and maths, the Department for Education (DfE) said. There is also provision for extra training and support for teachers, and funding to allow some year-13 students to repeat their final year if it was badly affected by the pandemic. It gave no immediate verdict on mooted plans to extend schools days by 30 minutes. This idea, criticised as misplaced by some teaching unions, will be the subject of a separate review due to report later in the year. Today’s WorldView email from the Washington Post by Ishaan Tharoor makes for quite bleak reading. He writes that while in the US, life is returning to normal, the pandemic is getting worse, even when it seems like it’s getting better: The pandemic is hardly in retreat elsewhere. The emergence of more virulent variants and the slowness of vaccination efforts in many places outside the West have contributed to deadly new waves. Coronavirus case counts worldwide are already higher in 2021 than they were in 2020. Southeast Asia, once a bastion of resistance to the virus, is in the grip of a harrowing spike in infections. Cases in Thailand and Vietnam rose dramatically over the past month. Malaysia is now registering more new infections per million people than any medium- or large-size country in Asia, surpassing India. In Africa, concerns are growing over the possible arrival of a new wave powered by a more transmissible variant of the virus, with the health systems in many countries at risk of being quickly subsumed by a surge of infections. A recent study found that the continent has the world’s highest death rate of patients critically ill with covid-19, thanks to limited intensive care facilities and reserves of vital medical supplies like oxygen. In parts of Latin America, the virus rages on, largely unabated. Peru, according to its own government-adjusted data, now has the worst covid-19 mortality rate per capita in the world. Even in East Asia, where a handful of nations set the gold standard in preventing community spread, the virus is on the march. Taiwan has seen an explosion of cases over the past month. In Japan, which still intends to host the Summer Olympics, numerous areas including Tokyo remain under a state of emergency. Read more here: Washington Post – The pandemic is getting worse, even when it seems like it’s getting better Neil Lancefield, PA Media’s transport correspondent, has some quotes from Tom Bartosak-Harlow from the Confederation of Passenger Transport (CPT) this morning. He’s worried that if face coverings and social distancing requirements continue on public transport in England after they have been dropped in other settings, it will stigmatise the use of buses and trains. He said: We need to see public transport moving at the same pace as the rest of the country. If you no longer have to wear a face covering in certain situations such as hospitality and retail but you do on public transport, we think that would undermine confidence in public transport. If people have this view that going on a bus or a coach carries a greater risk of catching Covid, in the longer term that will encourage people to use their car. Good morning, it is Martin Belam here taking over in London, where this morning the mayor Sadiq Khan has been warning fans of Scottish football not to travel if they don’t have tickets when England and Scotland face each other at Wembley on 18 June. Khan joins the Scottish government and Scottish Football Association (SFA) to ask fans not to travel to the city unless they have a ticket, or a safe place to watch the match. He said: “I am so excited for Euro 2020 and one of the games that I am looking forward to the most is England’s match with Scotland at Wembley. “I have some amazing memories of England v Scotland games in the past and I love the atmosphere that Scottish fans always bring to major football tournaments. “However, I am today urging all fans to only come to London if you have a ticket for the match or if you have arranged a safe place to watch it from, in compliance with Covid-19 guidelines.” He added: “I want to be completely clear that Scottish fans will not be able to access their traditional Trafalgar Square base, as it will be used as a socially-distanced fan zone for key workers who are helping our city through the pandemic. “Due to Covid regulations there are no alternative sites for fans to gather in large numbers in central London.” Here’s how UK media reported the great news on Tuesday of zero Covid-related deaths in the country for the first day since the pandemic began. Many papers suggest that the first day without a single Covid death for 10 months means the complete easing of lockdown restrictions will go ahead in England as planned on 21 June. Mexico has revised its death count, adding 4,272 fatalities. The clinical review of past deaths, by a team of doctors and nurses, is largely a record-keeping exercise, AP reports. Mexico’s government has long acknowledged that the true death toll from the pandemic is far higher than the current total of 227,840, due to low testing capabilities. Many Mexicans have died at home, or never been tested. As well as the medical team-led reviews, another process also provides adjusted figures. The computerised search of death certificates for Covid-related symptoms has suggested more than 350,000 have died, which would give Mexico one of the highest per-capita fatality rates in the world. Reuters: A shipment of coronavirus vaccines to North Korea via the global Covax sharing programme that was expected for late May has been delayed again amid protracted consultations, South Korea’s unification ministry said on Tuesday. Covax, which secures vaccines for poor countries, has said it will provide nearly 2 million doses of AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine to North Korea. “Countries that want Covax support are required to hold various consultations and submit some documents including an inoculation plan,” a ministry official said. “But in North Korea’s case, such consultations have been prolonged and it appears that the shipment will be made later than initially planned.” Insular and secretive North Korea has not commented on any consultations on vaccines. It has not officially confirmed any Covid-19 infections, although Seoul officials have said an outbreak there cannot be ruled out as the North had trade and people-to-people exchanges with China before closing its border early last year. The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) alliance, which co-leads Covax with the World Health Organization (WHO), said work is ongoing and discussions continue with North Korea, but no shipment date was finalised. GAVI said last month that shipments have not been made to North Korea due to its lack of “technical preparedness” and global supply shortages but could be expected later this year. In a statement last week to the ongoing WHO annual assembly, North Korea accused unspecified countries of dominating vaccine supplies and causing a global “bottleneck” due to “national egoism.” “Some countries are procuring and storing the vaccines more than their needs ... when other countries can’t even procure it,” it said. In the last few hours a few countries have reported updated daily case numbers. India has reported 132,788 new cases over the past 24 hours, and an additional 3,207 deaths. Health ministry data says the country’s infection tally is about 28.3 million, with more than 335,000 deaths. In Germany, the Robert Koch Institute has said 4,917 new cases has brought the country’s total to 3,687,828, and an additional 179 fatalities has raised the death toll to 88,774. China has reported 24 new cases, including 10 domestic cases all in Guangdong province where authorities have imposed localised lockdown measures to control an outbreak. It also reported seven asymptomatic cases in Guangdong, which are counted separately. Via AFP: The World Health Organization has approved the Sinovac Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use – the second Chinese vaccine to receive the WHO’s green light. The UN health agency signed off on CoronaVac, a two-dose vaccine developed by the Beijing-based firm which is already being deployed in several countries around the world. The WHO said the emergency use listing (EUL) gives countries, funders, procuring agencies and communities assurance that the vaccine has met international standards. Last month Sinopharm became the first Chinese vaccine to be approved by the WHO. The organisation has also given EUL status to vaccines being made by Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and the AstraZeneca jab being produced in India, South Korea and the EU, which it counts separately. WHO’s listing paves the way for countries worldwide to approve and import a vaccine for distribution quickly, especially those states without an international-standard regulator of their own. It also opens the door for the jabs to enter the Covax global vaccine-sharing facility, which aims to provide equitable access to doses around the world, particularly in poorer countries. Currently only AstraZeneca and some Pfizer jabs are flowing through the scheme. Read more here: Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s continuing rolling coverage of the pandemic. You can catch up on the previous live blog here, or see below for a quick roundup of the past 24 hours. The Australian state of Victoria has extended its lockdown for another seven days as it works to control an outbreak in Melbourne. The UK has enjoyed a day without a single reported Covid death for the first time since the pandemic began. India said it is aiming to triple capacity to 10 million jabs per day by July to avert another wave of Covid-19 infections as deadly as the outbreak suffered since April. A Brazilian Supreme Court judge has given president Jair Bolsonaro five days to submit information regarding the government’s decision to host the Copa America football tournament despite the nation’s ongoing struggles with Covid-19. A decrease in local Covid-19 vaccine production has slowed the pace of Brazil’s inoculation drive and contributed to a growing number of people not taking their second doses, according to the latest data from the Fiocruz biomedical institute. Heathrow airport in London has begun processing arrivals from red list countries in a dedicated terminal following concerns about them mixing with other passengers. Travellers arriving from red list nations on direct flights are being taken to Terminal 3. Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa called on faster delivery of vaccines to poorer countries, including by waiving patents on vaccine development. Peru has revised its official Covid-19 death toll to 180,764, nearly triple the previous official figure of 69,342, following a government review that shows the severity of the outbreak in the country. The World Health Organisation has recommended a new set of names for the coronavirus “variants of concern”, which will be known by letters of the Greek alphabet. Alpha is the new name for UK/Kent (B.1.1.7), Beta for South Africa (B.1.351), Gamma for Brazil (P.1) and Delta for the variant first detected in India (B.1.617.2). Malaysia has begun a tough nationwide lockdown to battle a worsening coronavirus outbreak. Of almost 2,800 deaths from Covid-19 recorded in the country of 32 million since the start of the pandemic, over 40 percent were in May alone. Israel announced it will begin phasing out coronavirus-related payments to the unemployed and Ireland announced similar steps later this year while maintaining other income and business supports as the economy fully reopens. The Coachella music festival will return to the US in April 2022 after being repeatedly delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic, organisers have announced.","charCount":"51964","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/yohannes-lowe\">Yohannes Lowe</a> (now); <a href=\"profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a> and <a href=\"profile/helen-davidson\">Helen Davidson</a> (earlier)"},{"headline":"EU delays adding UK to Covid ‘white list’ over fears of Delta variant","standfirst":"<p>Decision not to lift travel restrictions follows rise in cases linked to variant first identified in India</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus – latest updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul>","trailText":"Decision not to lift travel restrictions follows rise in cases linked to variant first identified in India<br>","byline":"Daniel Boffey in Brussels","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"879d3917f1f12800cd0d1bc0f6076812bc61234d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/879d3917f1f12800cd0d1bc0f6076812bc61234d/0_81_5906_3545/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Travellers arrive at Lisbon airport\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Travellers arrive at Lisbon airport.

Japan, which is in an extended state of emergency during which it has enjoyed a sustained reduction in infection cases, has been added to the list, diplomatic sources said. The country is due to host the Olympic Games on 23 July. The decision in principle was made during a meeting of ambassadors in Brussels on Wednesday. Sources said the UK’s status would be examined again on 14 June. Member states are recommended to lift travel restrictions on people coming from countries on the EU’s white list, which is currently composed of Israel, New Zealand, Rwanda, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand and Australia. The UK’s level of infection meets the threshold to enter the list but concerns over a rising trend in infections, largely driven by an increase in cases of the highly transmissible Delta variant, prompted EU ambassadors to be cautious. There were 24,090 people who tested positive in the UK over the last seven days – up 31.9% on the previous week. Hospitalisation was up 23.2%, from 706 to 870. Despite the official recommendation to member states, a number of countries in Europe, including Greece and Portugal, have said they welcome British tourists coming for their summer holidays.

At the peak of the second wave, in the week ending January 29, Covid-19 accounted for 45.7% of registered deaths. Diplomatic sources said the debate in the UK over whether to fully unlock restrictions on 21 June had fed into the EU’s debate over entry to the white list. A growing number of scientists, and advisers to the government, have urged the prime minister to delay the final lifting of restrictions including the removal of social contact limits and the opening of nightclubs and large events for fear of a third wave. Boris Johnson said on Wednesday there was still “nothing in the data at the moment that means we cannot go ahead with step four” of lifting coronavirus restrictions but he appeared less bullish than in previous days. “We’ve got to be so cautious,” the prime minister said. “We always knew that was going to happen.

The best the scientists can say at the moment is we just need to give it a little bit longer.”","charCount":"2944","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/daniel-boffey\">Daniel Boffey</a> in Brussels"},{"headline":"French Open: Zverev through, Tsitsipas and Serena Williams in action – live!

Meanwhile, a forehand down the line is enough for Martinez to break Tsitsipas; he leads 2-0 in the second, having lost the first 6-3. Looking around the courts, Azarenka [15] is 7-5 2-2 against Tauson and Keys [23], who a couple of years ago looked set to take the next step, leads Fernandez 6-1 3-2 (with a break)&gt;. Thanks Luke. As I mentioned earlier, Nishikori has the best five-set record in the history of the game and, having won the fourth, has got to be favourite here – though you’d usually lean towards the player with the bigger serve. We shall see... Nishikori holds his second service game of the fifth set against Khachanov, and it’s 2-1. And it’s time to hand back to Daniel Harris, who will see you through to the conclusion of this match, and the rest of today’s action. Bye! Tsitsipas wins his first set - 6-3 - against Pedro Martinez, on Court Suzanne Lenglen. On Court 13, meanwhile, Marcos Giron and Guido Pella are locked at 5-5 in the first set in their men’s singles encounter. Nishikori, meanwhile, holds serve in the first game of the deciding set against Khachanov. It’s been far from flawless, by both players, but it is certainly absorbing. Fabio Fognini defeats Marton Fucsovics in regulation straight-sets style: 7-6, 6-1, 6-2. Nishikori wins the fourth! Khachanov will be annoyed with that to say the least. A couple of unforced errors allowed his opponent a relatively comfortable break. Nishikori heads for a ‘comfort break’ with the satisfaction of having forced a deciding set. This one is going the distance. Azarenka proves her class by taking that first set 7-5 against Clara Tauson over on Court Simonne Mathieu. Now Nishikori holds after what was a bit of a sloppy game from his opponent. Nishikori hit one particularly short shot, and Khachanov had the court at his mercy, but he appeared to fail to make a decision and ended up patting a forehand harmlessly wide. The Japanese player is 5-4 up, and the Russian needs to hold serve to stay in the fourth set. Azarenka breaks Tauson! She’s 6-5 up now and serving for the set. Keys wins her first set, against Fernandez, by a comfortable margin of 6-1. Now it’s Khachanov’s turn to save his bacon on his own serve. He smashes a big wide serve to make it 4-4, and treats himself to a demonstrative fist-pump. Krajinović is fighting against Isner, and has made it 4-4 in the third. Davidovich Fokina, meanwhile, had gone a break up on Van de Zandschulp in the deciding set in their second-round match. Keys leads Fernandez 5-1, while Azarenka has forced it to deuce in the first set against Tauson, having held serve for 5-5. Nishikori holds on to go 4-3 up! That was a captivating game - if a little error-strewn on Nishikori’s part. Khachanov nearly forced his way through, but the 31-year-old Japanese player showed plenty of bottle to save several break points, and battled to find a way in the end. Can Nishikori force a deciding set? We are about to find out. Madison Keys is 3-1 up on Leylah Annie Fernandez in their second-round encounter. Azarenka is fighting against Tauson, 5-4 down and serving to stay in the first set. Over on Court 14, Fognini has taken the second set 6-1 against Fucsovics, a more one-sided affair after he won the first set on a tie-break. So it’s 2-0 there. Now Khachanov forces deuce with a deep forehand, in our ‘featured game’, then gets a break point, but Nishikori bravely wins it with a serve-volley point. But now Nishikori double faults! Another glimmer of light for Khachanov. But again, Nishikori saves the point and we’re back to deuce. Nishikori forces a break point from deuce, but Khachanov wins the point with a classy forehand down the line. This is a very well-matched encounter to say the least. Khachanov wins the game, and Nishikori will serve at 3-3 in this pesky wind. It’s business time for Stefanos Tsitsipas. A bit of hustle and a booming forehand here and there, and Nishkikori does extremely well to save that break point, and then take the game. He leads 3-2 in the fourth. Davidovich Fokina and Van de Zandschulp are into a fifth set, meanwhile, and Isner is cruising to victory against Krajinović, two sets up and 2-1 up in the third. In the women’s singles, Azarenka is 3-2 down to Tauson in the first set, over on Court Simonne Mathieu. Khachanov and Nishikori are locked at 2-2 and deuce in the fourth ... big point coming up ... and Khachanov takes it for a break point! Thank you Daniel and good afternoon, everyone. You can email me here, if you so desire, during my one-hour stint at the Roland Garros MBM coalface. Righto, I’m off to scran and school run. Luke McLaughlin will coax you through the next hour. Those first-set breakers look like hey were crucial; both Isner and Fognini are ahead in their second sets against Krajinovic and Gucsovics, 5-1 and 3-0 respectively. At 1-1 in set four, Nishikori finds himself facing break point only for the umpire to pause play while the wind blows clay about. Khachanov then sets about things, two punishing backhands enough to see him in front! He’s looking good at 2-1, 2-1. Elsewhere, we’ve got some action at haitch cue, which you can follow with Rob Smyth. Hercog says Garcia is a big challenge, moving well and hitting well, noting she was 0-4 against her. “It’s not the same sport playing without the crowd,” she says (when prompted of course), and winds it up a touch by saying they inspired her to fight back in the first set. She’s never done better than the round of 16 at Roland Garros, and is “really looking forward to the next challenge”, but notes that “everyone has plans”. Next on Lenglen: Tsitsipas [5] v Martinez. If you insist. She’s delighted with that, hollering and bouncing in the face of some partisan home support. She meets Vondrousova next – that should be decent. Khachanov only needs the one go, taking the third set against Nishikori 6-2. I’ve no idea what’ll happen next, though, because neither man has played that well for that long so far. Back on Lenglen, Hercog – with the help of a beautiful lob – earns three more match points, all of them saved by Garcia to the thrill of the crowd. She salutes them, then gets broken again, and Hercog will have her second shy at closing out. Nishikori nets a backhand which gives Khachanov the double break; he’ll have his first go at serving for set three in a minute. Elsewhere, Fognini and Isner won their first-set breakers against Fucsovics and Krajinovic respectively. Now then! On Lenglen, Hercog has just served for the match against Garcia, and though she’s got another break with which to play, she won’t be ecstatic at having served a double on match point. The crowd, on the other hand, are going wild for the local girl, who is now serving at 4-5 in set two. It’s pretty windy at the moment, and it’s also looking a bit dark. I’d not rule out the possibility of rain, but hopefully it won’t bother. We do, though, have a roof on Chatrier, so if it happens we’ll have enough to keep us going. After narrowly avoiding being broken at the start of set three, Khachanov has broken Nishikori and consolidates well enough; what this match needs is for both men to play well at the same time, but at the moment they’re taking it in turns. Khachanov 6-4 2-6 3-1 Nishikori Hercog has nearly done for Garcia, leading 7-5 4-1; elsewhere, Fognini and Fucsovics, and Krajinovic and Isner and playing breakers in set one. What a win that is! Laaksonen had never made round three of a slam and to do so here he had to qualify then save three match points in round one. But he was superb today and Bautista Agut let him play his game, so it’s he who goes on to meet either Khachanov or Nishikori. Laaksonen sends a backhand winner spinning cross-court and Bautista Agut turns with a look of furious resignation; it’s not meant to be like this, but he can’t stop it being like this. Laaksonen really has played beautifully today, going for his shotS and generally being the more unpredictable of the two. Bautista Agut has struggled to get anything going since winning the second set, and two huge winners from Laaksonen take him two points away.... Khachanov has made a miserable start to the third set, disbursing a variety of unforced errors. But on break point, he finds as many large forehands as he needs to force Nishikoi to net, then pounds one to the corner when facing another ... and another. He holds, while, Laaksonen – who’s kept Bautista Agut guessing all match – immediately retrieves his double-break! In a moment, he’ll serve for the match! Hello! Out of nowhere, Bautista Agut breaks to love, Laaksonen driving a forehand long, and this might not be over quite yet. Laaksonen 6-3 2-6 6-3 4-2 Bautista Agut Hercog has just taken the first set against Garcia 7-5, while Bautista Agut has just saved another double-break point. He can’t hold out though, a forehand down the line putting Laaksonen very close to round three; he leads 4-1 and by two sets to one. Facing a break-back point, Laaksonen fids a ludicrous backhand drop, from well back and at shoulder-height, the ball skittering away at quite the angle once it bounces. He’s absolutely loving this, while on Chatrier, Nishikori’s forehand earns him a second break of serve and the second set against Khachanov. Laaksonen is giving Bautista Agut all he can handle here, forcing him through a succession of deuces just to stave off the double break. In the process, he plays one divine forehand cross-court, and if he can sustain this hit streak for just a little bit longer, he’ll be into round three. Khachanov loses concentration, near enough handing Nishikori a break to love. He leads 3-0 in set two, Khachanov having taken the first 6-4. Laaksonen is playing the match of his life here; he arranges another break point, and a loopy forehand to Bautista Agut’s backhand corner allows him to scurry in for the drop! You’d not back against him now! Laaksonen 6-3 2-6 6-3 1-0 Bautista Agut On Lenglen, Hercog – who had a great win against Bertens in round one – is underway against Garcia. It’s currently 3-3. Bautista Agut gets himself a break-back point but Laaksonen confiscates it from him before closing out! He now leads by two sets to one, and a won for him would be a massive shock. Meanwhile, after playing a really good set Laaksonen is facing deuce in the process of serving for it and Delbonnis has beaten Andujar; it’s Fucsovics or Fognini next for him. They’ve just started. Power is beating finesse at the moment, Khachanov holding to 15 to take the first set against Nishikori 6-4. I remember a UFC fighter called Sam Stout whose nickname was “Hands of Stone” even though he didn’t have knockout power, which reminds me of Brad “One Punch” Pickett, so called because he wanted his opponents to think he could take them out with a single shot, although he couldn’t. Nishikori holds for 4-5, so Khachanov will now serve for the first set. Khachanov and his stone hands are playing nicely – he leads Nishikori 4-3 – while Laaksonen is 4-1 in front against Bautista Agut. Talking of things made of stone reminds me of the Stone Roses song, one of very few whose title only appears as its final words. Squeeze’s Up the Junction is another as is U2’s Running to Stand Still. While I was watching the end of that, Khachanov broke Nishikori and leads 3-2, while a zipping forehand, cross-court, on the run, and only just over the net, arranged Laaksonen a break point. Bautista Agut saved it, but couldn’t do likewise with the next – he’s not coping well with the Swiss’ power. What a match that was! Kudermetova served for it at 5-4, but Siniakova hung in there then played a terrific game to get home, consecutive blistering forehands sealing the deal. She meets Zidansek next, and that should be a lot of fun. Ruud is now two sets and a break up against Majchrzak; that one won’t be going much longer. Delbonnis and Andujar are playing a final set and as I type that, Delbonnis – who won the fourth to level the match – breaks at the first time of asking. On 14, Kudermetova was broken serving for the match, so she and Siniakova are 5-5 in the decider. Yeah, time’s up. Bautista Agut is all over Laaksonen now, and an ace gives him the second set 6-2; it’s hard to see how he doesn’t win from here. Back to Khachanov, “Stone hands,” returns Calvin. “He like to stand at the back and club away. Also, Nishikori has the best five-set record of anyone, ever.” That one Murray lost to him at Flushing Meadow in 2016 was the most significant of his missed opportunities, I’d say. Khachanov and Nishikori are away and Calvin Betton, our resident tennis coach, messages to say that the former has huge weapons but the smarter players think they can get to him because he lacks touch and dexterity. Currently, Nishikori is serving at 1-1 while, on Mathieu, Bautista Agut has consolidated his second-set break. Laaksonen 6-3 2-4 Bautista Agut She meets Kasatkina next; I’ll look forward to that one because though Kasatkina is the better player, the form Cirstea is in, it should be a decent tussle. Bautista Agut has woken up, the consistency of his groundstrokes persuading Laaksonen to net; he now leads by a break in set two, though the qualifer leads by one set to love. Kudermetova is nearly there against Siniakova, serving for 5-1 in the decider, while Cirstea is serving for the match against Trevisan. That is a brilliant breaker, but don’t sleep on how well Safiullin played today – he’s only 23 and has a lot to look forward to. Zverev meets Kecmanovic or Djere next; currently, Kecmanovic leads 2-1 but Djere is a break up in set three. A majestic backhand from Zverev steals a point that Safiullin was dominating and although it’s for a hold I wonder if we’ll see it as the key moment in this breaker; shonuff, a netted backhand hands over the mini-break, a delicious topspun backhand doubles it, and at 4-1 it’s nearly curtains. From 0-15 down Zverev powers through a hold – sealed with an ace as Jason Donovan (and Bobby Vinton) once sang. We’ll now have a second breaker of the match. Have a look! Laaksonen has just taken the first set against Bautista Agut, 6-3, so I’m switching to have a closer look at that while we wait for Khachanov and Nishikori (and by the time they start, Zverev and Safiullin might be done). They reckon it’s not as hot now as an hour ago, so the court and balls are playing a bit slower, which is to Zverev’s disadvantage. But he powers through a service-game all the same and it’s now 5-5 there, while on 14, Kudermotova has broken Siniakova and leads 2-1 in the decider, and on 13 Andujar leads Delbonnis 2-1. On Mathieu, Laaksonen – a qualifier - leads Bautista Agut, the number 11 seed, leads 4-3 with a break. Meanwhile, Trevisan has made it one each against Cirstea and it’s now 3-3 in the decider; Kudermetova has done likewise against Siniakova; and Ruud is a set up on Majchrzak. Zverev has broken back and is now asserting his way through a hold, which he concludes with a drive at the bod. It’s now 4-4 in set three. Coming up next on Chatrier, we’ve got Khachanov [23] v Nishikori, which might well be the match of the day. Vondrousova says it was tough to play against the crowd – that seems a reach – but she’s glad the crowd are back and to win her first match on Chatrier. She looks really pleased with herself and well she might – this was a total deconstruction, and she meets Hercog or Garcia next. On Chatrier, Tan hangs in there well to save a match point then hold, but Vondrousova will now serve for the match at 6-1 5-3. My computer crashes, returning in time for me to hear that a loose game from Zverev has handed Safiullin another break. On the one hand, to be put under pressure is no bad thing, but on the other, carelessness of that ilk is one reason he rarely beats players ranked higher. Safiullin has stabilised, opening set three with a pair of holds; he leads 2-1. Elsewhere, Bautista Agut [11] and Laaksonen are just away on Mathieu, while on seven, Ruud [15] is a break up against Majchrzak. On 14, Kudermetova has taken Siniakova’s break back – the latter now leads 7-6 4-3 – and on 13, Andujar has done likewise to Delbonnis, so they’re one set all and on serve. Tan has nothing for Vondrousova, who’s playing better shots but also reading her. She leads 6-1 3-0. Yup, there we go. Zverev rushes through a love hold to make it five games in a row, and he’ll feel that he’s broken the back of this match now, two sets in front. Zverev 7-6(4) 6-3 Safiullin Zverev gets 0-30 and eventually finds himself with a break point thanks to two sizeable forehands; Safiullin saves it, but another crushing blow earns him a second ... but forced wide, he unloads the suitcase at one down the line that’s plenty wide. No matter, he racks a third and this time the forehand does the trick, forcing yerman wide, and he nets. Zverev 7-6(4) 5-3 Safiullin Delbonnis has got himself going, taking the second set against Andujar 6-1, then opening a 2-0 lead in the third. Vondrousova has Tan on strings, and Tan is finding it hard, flapping a backhand volley into the net and ceding the first set in the process, 6-1. Zverev knows that ultimately, he’s got too much for Safiullin, and two big forehands convert the second of two break points. They’re 3-3 in set two now. With the end of the Kasatkina match I’ve switched to Vondrousova, and she’s all over Tan, 5-1 up. She’s looking very nifty indeed and will fancy herself to go deep now she’s got the number six seed’s path. Next for her is Siniakova or Kudermetova; currently, the former leads by a set and a break. That’s a fine performance from the Russian, which she ends with the exclamation mark of an ace. I really enjoyed watching her today – she varied spin and pace beautifully, and meets Cirstea or Trevisan next. Currently, Cirstea leads by one set to love but is a break down. Meantime, Safiullin consolidates well, and given how he’s served today, he’ll fancy himself to hold it down. Zverev 7-6(4) 1-3 Safiullin Bencic fights through a hold, so Kasatkina will now serve for the match at 5-2. There were signs in that last game that Bencic was finding some range – she delivered two colossal forehands – but she’ll need to find the consistency that’s eluded her thus far. Zverev sends down an eighth double, hammers his racket into the court – that’ll learn it – and at 1-1, Safiullin has a break point ... which he converts when Zverev dumps a forehand! He looks extremely displeased on his way to sit down. Bencic forces Kasatkina to deuce, but Kasatkina is grooved and consolidates for 5-1. Meanwhile, Siniakova has taken her breaker against Kudermetova 9-7, while Vondrousova is now a break up on Tan at 2-1. You’ve got to laugh. Bencic saves three double-break points, then facing a fourth, Siniakova’s backhand clips the net cord, leaps over her racket and drops in. At 4-1 in the second set, this looks very close to over. We’re away on Chatrier now, Tan taking the first game against Vondrousova – who played really well to come back and beat Kanepi in round one. Zverev cedes one of his mini-breaks via careless forehand, but a booming ace out wide preserves the other and secures the set. Zverev 7-6(4) Safiullin This is excellent from Zverev, his serve firing and a precise overhead giving him 5-2. Surely he’ll close out this time? Have a look! Two doubles, some poor shot-selection, and Safiullin breaks Zverev! Or, in other words, I am a idiot. They’ll now play a breaker, and they way the Russian has served so far, it’s no gimme. Kecmanovic, who played so well in beating Dan Evans on Monday, has taken the first set against Djere; Andujar served out for 6-4 against Delbonis; Cirstea broke to do likewise against Trevias; and Siniakova and Kudermetova have gone to a breaker. Temper temper; do people still say that? Kasatkina puts Bencic under more pressure, hitting to her forehand at 15-30 and inciting the error; Bencic duly introduces racket to clay. She then saves the first break point, but a tame backhand into the top of the net puts her in all sorts. Kasatkina 6-2 2-1 Bencic Zverev turns it up, a succession of bousting groundstrokes, mainly down the middle, turning 15-30 into 15-40. Safiullin has served really well so far, but two humungous forehands from Zverev, inside-out onto the sideline, then cross-court to the corner, earn him the break. Hell now serve for the set at 6-5, and this looks a lot like class telling. We’re at the various business ends now. On Lenglen, Zverev is serving at 4-5 ... and it’s now 5-5; Cirstea, conqueror of Konta, leads Trevisan 5-4, on serve; Andujar, triumphant over Thiem, leads Delbonis 5-4 with a break; and Siniakova has broken Kudermetova back so they’re now at 4-5. On seven, Brengle fought her way back against Zidansek, only to be broken once she’d got level, losing the set 6-4 in the process. Down 2-5, Bencic improves a little with the new balls, fighting her way to deuce. But Kasatkina serves out to take the first set 6-2, and the number 10 seed has a pack of graft to get done. In commentary, they say that someone – Yevgeny Kafelnikov I think – reckons that of all the women on the tour, Kasatkina has realised least of her potential, which is to say she’s very good. And Bencic is feeling it, broken again – this time to love. Kasatkina leads 5-2 and is serving for the set. I said earlier that Zverev looked comfy out there; behold his rig. He’s also just deployed the monster-serve to save a break point, quickly closing out thereafter. Out on court seven, Tamara Zidansek – who played brilliantly in outlasting Bianca Andreescu, the number six seed, in round one – has carried on her good form. She leads Madison Brengle 5-1, while on 14, Kudermetova – seeded 29 – is 4-1 up on Siniakova. Annabel Croft reckons it’ll be Tsitsipas who makes the final from the bottom half of the draw which also features Zverev; that seems fair enough to me, and I’m sure he’s chuffed that Djokovic and Nadal are in the top. They’ll likely meet in the semis, and what an epic that could be. Anyway, we’re getting ahead of waselves; currently, Safiullin is playing nicely and leads 3-2 on serve. Yep, Kasatkina is a player, and she puts Bencic’s serve under pressure with a booming backhand down the line that earns break point ... which she then converts thanks to a double. Kasatkina 2-1 Bencic It’s only 1-1, but Zverev looks really comfy out there. Thing is, we know he’s a reliable eliminator of inferior opponents, problem is he rarely beats those ranked higher. I’m also watching Bencic v Kasatkina. Bencic, the number 10 seed, had a decent win against Podoroska in round one, but Kasatkina is a player and has reached the last eight if this competition before. She does really well to survive a break point in her first service game; it’s now 1-1. Zverev had a tricky opening encounter, forced to come from two sets down to beat Oscar Otte. But he did so in grand style, taking the three that he won 2, 2 and 0; I didn’t see that match, but it looks a lot like he took time to settle, then imposed himself as you’d expect. Sascha Zverev, then. Will he ever win a major? Er, if I’m going to answer my own question I’d say that the answer is no because there’ll always be someone better, but his win at the Madrid Open, featuring wins over Thiem and Nadal, hinted at a better tomorrow. I’d be surprised if he sorted things this time, but as long as he keeps improving there’s always a chance.

Falling levels of oxygen in oceans had already been identified, but new research shows that the decline in lakes has been between three and nine times faster in the past 40 years. Scientists found oxygen levels had fallen by 19% in deep waters and 5% at the surface. Rising temperatures driven by global heating is the main cause, because warmer water cannot hold as much oxygen. Furthermore, rising summer heat leaves the top layer of lakes hotter and less dense than the waters below, meaning mixing is reduced and oxygen supply to the depths falls. Oxygen levels have increased at the surface of some lakes. But this is most likely due to higher temperatures driving algal blooms, which can also produce dangerous toxins. Cutting emissions to tackle the climate crisis is vital, the scientists said, as well as cutting the use of farm fertiliser and urban sewage pollution that also damages lakes. “All complex life depends on oxygen and so, when oxygen levels drop, you really decrease the habitat for many different species.” said Prof Kevin Rose, of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in the US, who was part of the research team. “This study proves that the problem is even more severe in fresh waters [than in oceans], threatening our drinking water supplies and the delicate balance that enables complex freshwater ecosystems to thrive,” said Curt Breneman, RPI’s dean of science. Freshwater habitats are rich in fish, insects, birds and animals, and are important for food and recreation for humans. But they have already suffered great damage, with average wildlife populations having fallen by 84% since 1970. In addition to global heating and pollution, the causes include overuse of water for farming. The study, published in the journal Nature, analysed 45,000 dissolved oxygen and temperature profiles collected from nearly 400 lakes worldwide. Most records started in about 1980, though one went back to 1941. Most of the lakes were in temperate zones, particularly in Europe and the US, but there were a few records from higher latitudes, nearer the poles, and for tropical lakes in Africa. In both cases, oxygen was falling as in the other lakes. In lakes where oxygen levels have fallen to almost zero, phosphorus can be drawn out of sediments, providing an essential nutrient for bacteria. These can proliferate and produce the powerful greenhouse gas methane, driving further heating. Oxygen levels in surface waters were increasing in about a fifth of the lakes studied, almost all of which were prone to pollution. This is an indicator of widespread increases in algal blooms, said Rose. “Without taxonomic data, we can’t say that definitively, but nothing else we’re aware of can explain this pattern.” Global temperatures are still rising, pushing lake oxygen levels ever lower, so just keeping the status quo requires action to clean up freshwater bodies.

Rock stars were interested in them because they were real.”</p> <p>A key part of that reality was captured by another GTO, Pamela Des Barres, in her classic 1987 memoir, I’m With the Band: Memoirs of A Groupie. But in Permanent Damage, Miss Mercy tells a very different story – a far wilder and more perilous one. Sadly, that story ended last July when Mercy Fontenot died of liver cancer at 71. Before her death, however, she fully approved the publication of a book that unflinchingly chronicles her many drug addictions, her two ruinous marriages – one to the psychedelic soul star Shuggie Otis – the suicides of her parents, her fractious relationship with her son, her years of homelessness, as well as at least four instances of rape. At one point, Parker reports, her own mother told her: “You might as well kill yourself.”</p> <p>The most jarring part? The book reads like a romp, aided by Mercy’s keen sense of the absurd and flair for black humor. “She actually thought her life was kinda fun,” said Parker. “She didn’t think, ‘Oh look at this sad, horrible person’. And she would never want anyone to feel sorry for her. To Mercy, it was all an adventure – even when she was homeless.”</p> <p>Parker allows that Mercy’s “sarcastic sense of humor and harsh tone was a defense mechanism. She compartmentalized a lot of things and tried to minimize them,” she said. “Part of that was because she hated the idea of playing the victim. But she also needed to do it because she went through so much heavy shit in her life.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1006ef1f09b1f415f14355d6cc5c4bff284a86d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1006ef1f09b1f415f14355d6cc5c4bff284a86d0/0_0_2035_2383/854.jpg\" alt=\"Miss Mercy in 1981.\" width=\"854\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Miss Mercy in 1981.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The estate of Miss Mercy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It began early. At nine, Mercy had her first brush with death when a riptide nearly drowned her while she was swimming in the ocean. “After that, she felt invincible,” Parker said. “She tested that many times.”</p> <p>Her parents provided ideal role models for a reckless life. Her father was a gambling addict and womanizer who suffered from delusions of grandeur; her mother, who had depression, was addicted to diet pills, which contained speed. Believing her daughter to be chubby, she fed the same type of pills to Mercy. At 15, she was living on the streets of San Francisco, right on time for the Summer of Love. Her intense attraction to, and appreciation of, music, along with her single-mindedness, allowed her to befriend or bed many a musician in that historic scene. Still, the book makes clear that sex was never Mercy’s prime motivator. “She wasn’t even that into having sex with those guys,” Parker said. “She just wanted to be in their orbit.”</p> <p>Her sense of humor became a point of attraction for the men, since she wasn’t a conventional beauty. Her extreme approach to style also helped her stand out. Inspired by the silent film actor Theda Bara, she blackened her eyes with heavy make-up and wore densely layered clothes to create her own take on the hippie gypsy look. Mercy’s distinctive aesthetic, and assertive character, helped her get onto the cover of Rolling Stone twice, first in a story about the Haight-Ashbury “Gathering of the Tribes” Be-In of 1967, then in a famous piece about the groupie scene with pictures shot by Baron Wolman. “If the term ‘influencer’ existed then, she would have been one,” Parker said.</p> <p>“The women in that scene were courtesans in the classic Colette sense,” said Richard Goldstein, who wrote one of the first serious rock columns in the 1960s. “They were women of high status in the rock community and among fans. They were legendary.”</p> <p>The attitudes women such as Mercy and Pamela displayed put them at the forefront of the sexual revolution, while their sense of style proved enduringly influential. In 2018, the fashion designer Alexa Chung devised The Muse line in honor of their look and character. “Mercy loved the fact that we were getting attention later in life,” said Pamela Des Barres. “We were so imitated.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"81e4cb0309851fb4bc5e7e809d75efdc9b9e5a44\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81e4cb0309851fb4bc5e7e809d75efdc9b9e5a44/0_170_6000_3599/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Miss Mercy with Pamela Des Barres, 2017\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Miss Mercy with fellow GTO Pamela Des Barres in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Vega-Warholy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mercy’s antenna for music’s constant shifts led her to migrate from the Haight down to LA by the late 60s, where she quickly ensconced herself in the Laurel Canyon scene. There, she met Zappa who thought her perfect for the girl group he was forming. “Frank said we needed a bizarre element,” Des Barres said, with a laugh. “When Mercy walked in, he said: ‘There’s your new GTO.’ At first, I didn’t think I could deal with her. She had taken hundreds and hundreds of acid trips, and at that point I had barely smoked pot! But we wound up becoming incredibly close.”</p> <p>Zappa exploited that closeness by giving the group a provocative name that suggested they were lesbians. “Mercy loved to play that up,” Parker said. “And while she did have many crushes on women, most of them she didn’t act upon.”</p> <p>She also had a tendency to fruitlessly seek gay men as lovers. In terms of gender, Mercy considered herself non-binary 40 years before that became a common description. She also had a deep affinity for Black culture, championing its under-recognized stars and claiming in her memoir to bed artists from Al Green to Chuck Berry to Taj Mahal.</p> <p>The one album the GTOs recorded, titled Permanent Damage, was shambolic in many ways, but, due to Zappa’s blessing, it boasted musicians as formidable as Jeff Beck, Lowell George and, on one track, Rod Stewart singing with an off-key Mercy. “Though the group was put together by Zappa, they were pretty much left to their own devices,” Parker said. “No one told them how to act or what to wear. Obviously, no one else could have created<em> </em>Mercy’s look. As for the music, Frank just told them ‘come back with two songs each.’ Some of them weren’t even songs. They were just the girls talking. Mercy’s were actual songs, if weird-ass ones. You can argue the merits of how listenable it was but it’s definitely an artifact of its time.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2oRCCvurGM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/I2oRCCvurGM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Unfortunately, Mercy’s prodigious drug use so angered the famously sober Zappa he pulled the plug on the group in less than a year. In one harrowing instance, she scored heroin from the dealer who, the next day, gave Janis Joplin what turned out to be her fatal dose. Her marriages proved equally alarming. Parker said she got Otis to marry her by essentially “wearing him down”. Throughout their marriage, he was seeing another woman who, he made clear, he far preferred. Mercy’s second husband humiliated her every chance he got.</p> <p>While her marriage to Otis produced a child, he was raised mainly by his grandparents, which made him feel abandoned. Interviewing Mercy for the book, Parker said she had enormous trouble getting her to admit the pain she likely felt at being rejected by her son. In a similar way, Mercy downplayed the psychological effect of her multiple rapes. “She would say, ‘Yeah, some women get raped and they never recover. But I just brush myself off and go dancing afterwards,’” Parker said. “She took great pride in being tough. But I don’t believe that it didn’t affect her.”</p> <p>Mercy’s iron-hard shell caused the author to worry that readers might find her unrelatable or unlikable. But after she died, Parker found a diary Mercy had kept that revealed a hidden vulnerability. “She wrote about the pain of neglecting her kid,” the author said. “She would never say that to my face, but there it was.”</p> <p>In her later years, she became sober and even helped Des Barres care for her elderly mother in her final months. At the same time, she highly valued the wildest parts of her life. “Unlike most people, she had no fear mechanism,” Parker said. “If that often got her into dangerous situations, it also got into a lot of fun situations other people might have missed. I think Mercy would love it if, after people read the book, they said, ‘Wow, that chick was a freak!’ To her, that would be the ultimate compliment.”</p> <ul> <li><p>Permanent Damage: Memoirs of an Outrageous Girl is out on 9 June</p></li> </ul>","wordcount":"1496","firstPublicationDate":"2021-06-02T15:00:43Z","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2021-06-02T15:02:22Z","productionOffice":"US","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/p/hjt26","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/862aeefd99a8440dcaf7520fcd0f20031696c7ba/0_696_14929_8963/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","isLive":"true","bodyText":"For many people, the notion of the groupie brings to mind something generic: a woman known solely for her relationship to her rock star of choice.

But we wound up becoming incredibly close.” Zappa exploited that closeness by giving the group a provocative name that suggested they were lesbians. “Mercy loved to play that up,” Parker said. “And while she did have many crushes on women, most of them she didn’t act upon.” She also had a tendency to fruitlessly seek gay men as lovers. In terms of gender, Mercy considered herself non-binary 40 years before that became a common description. She also had a deep affinity for Black culture, championing its under-recognized stars and claiming in her memoir to bed artists from Al Green to Chuck Berry to Taj Mahal. The one album the GTOs recorded, titled Permanent Damage, was shambolic in many ways, but, due to Zappa’s blessing, it boasted musicians as formidable as Jeff Beck, Lowell George and, on one track, Rod Stewart singing with an off-key Mercy. “Though the group was put together by Zappa, they were pretty much left to their own devices,” Parker said. “No one told them how to act or what to wear. Obviously, no one else could have created Mercy’s look. As for the music, Frank just told them ‘come back with two songs each.’ Some of them weren’t even songs. They were just the girls talking. Mercy’s were actual songs, if weird-ass ones. You can argue the merits of how listenable it was but it’s definitely an artifact of its time.” Unfortunately, Mercy’s prodigious drug use so angered the famously sober Zappa he pulled the plug on the group in less than a year. In one harrowing instance, she scored heroin from the dealer who, the next day, gave Janis Joplin what turned out to be her fatal dose. Her marriages proved equally alarming. Parker said she got Otis to marry her by essentially “wearing him down”. Throughout their marriage, he was seeing another woman who, he made clear, he far preferred. Mercy’s second husband humiliated her every chance he got. While her marriage to Otis produced a child, he was raised mainly by his grandparents, which made him feel abandoned. Interviewing Mercy for the book, Parker said she had enormous trouble getting her to admit the pain she likely felt at being rejected by her son. In a similar way, Mercy downplayed the psychological effect of her multiple rapes. “She would say, ‘Yeah, some women get raped and they never recover. But I just brush myself off and go dancing afterwards,’” Parker said. “She took great pride in being tough. But I don’t believe that it didn’t affect her.” Mercy’s iron-hard shell caused the author to worry that readers might find her unrelatable or unlikable. But after she died, Parker found a diary Mercy had kept that revealed a hidden vulnerability. “She wrote about the pain of neglecting her kid,” the author said. “She would never say that to my face, but there it was.” In her later years, she became sober and even helped Des Barres care for her elderly mother in her final months. At the same time, she highly valued the wildest parts of her life. “Unlike most people, she had no fear mechanism,” Parker said. “If that often got her into dangerous situations, it also got into a lot of fun situations other people might have missed. I think Mercy would love it if, after people read the book, they said, ‘Wow, that chick was a freak!’ To her, that would be the ultimate compliment.” Permanent Damage: Memoirs of an Outrageous Girl is out on 9 June","charCount":"8608","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"true","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/jim-farber\">Jim Farber</a>"}]

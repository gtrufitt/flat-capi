(1967)</a>. With its bold illustrations and repetitive and interrogative text, this was an immediate success. Working on Martin’s few but skilfully chosen words was a fortunate starting point for Carle.

It is the persistent absence of any convincing evidence either for or against the theory that has prompted calls for more investigation.</p> \n   <p>At least publicly, the evidence in favor of a link between the outbreak and the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) has not changed significantly in months, and many virologists still have persistent doubts that such a link exists.</p> \n   <p>What has clearly changed, however, is the political debate. Most obviously, a new U.S. administration that is not so openly anti-China has led some former skeptics to reconsider the existing evidence.

Why not?”</p> \n  <p>Jenrick again responded with a fairly generic line, saying “I think that the department for health and the health secretary, have worked exceptionally hard over the course of this pandemic. This was an unprecedented situation, it was a national effort involving all parts of government, and all parts of the country. I think the public will appreciate, if you think back to the events of this time last year, how challenging it really was. Many things happen, of course they’ll be things which we could have done better and we’re learning those lessons as we go along.</p> \n  <p>“The public inquiry will air that and hear the evidence in a reasoned and reflective manner. I think that is the right way to do that. But absolutely, I think the country responded phenomenally to the events of last year.

I’ll be with you for the next few hours. We’ve just published this from <strong>Dr Deepti Gurdasani</strong>, who is a clinical epidemiologist and senior lecturer in machine learning at Queen Mary University of London:</em></p> \n  <p>Amid the select committee revelations from <strong>Dominic Cummings</strong>, and in his recent claims on social media, there has been a lot of focus on suggestions that the UK government was following a “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/23/priti-patel-denies-cummings-claim-herd-immunity-was-ever-uk-policy\">herd immunity</a>” policy at the start of the pandemic, costing thousands of lives in the process. Of course, none of this is surprising.</p> \n  <p>It is very clear that this was the flawed policy of the government through early March last year, not least because it was publicly discussed by the <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/health/boris-johnson-coronavirus-this-morning/\">prime minister</a> and by many <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Kilsally/status/1238780879050326016?s=20\">scientific advisers</a> to the government – including <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XRc389TvG8\">Patrick Vallance</a>, who spoke of “enough people becoming immune to this” with mild illness, to help build herd immunity.</p> \n  <p>The alternative strategy of high suppression or elimination of the virus was rejected by the government very early on, despite strong evidence from other countries around the world showing that this could be successfully applied.</p> \n  <p>There were several elements that underpinned the devastating herd immunity strategy. It was believed that infection of large swathes of the population was inevitable, and acceptable, and that there was no way to prevent it. This came with the tacit acknowledgment that hundreds of thousands of deaths were acceptable, most of which would occur among vulnerable and elderly people. A sense of national exceptionalism held by some suggested that other countries’ experiences didn’t apply to us – despite that by March we had had months to observe and learn from countries in south Asia, and seeing the devastating impact of late action in Italy.</p> \n  <p>Real-world evidence was ignored in favour of models and flawed thinking. The government’s strategy repeatedly conflated Covid-19 with flu, ignoring the much higher transmissibility, higher susceptibility, which would lead to many more people getting infected and dying, and unknown long-term impacts from a novel virus. Finally, there was the idea that the health of the economy needed to be balanced with public health. A lot of emphasis was placed on the disruption lockdowns would cause, with attempts to slow down such decisions, without understanding that delays would inevitably lead to even longer lockdowns and more economic damage.</p> \n  <p><strong>Read more here: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/may/27/government-covid-strategy-herd-immunity-westminster\">Deepti Gurdasani – The UK government’s Covid strategy was discredited but we’re still paying the price</a></strong></p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/may/27/government-covid-strategy-herd-immunity-westminster\">The government's Covid strategy was discredited but we're still paying the price | Deepti Gurdasani</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-05-27T06:14:03.432Z\">at 7.14am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-60af35588f088d8c3178a79d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-05-27T06:00:22.782Z\">7.00am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Facebook to allow posts saying Covid ‘man-made’</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>This is <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2020/04/covid-19-misinfo-update/#removing-more-false-claims\">Facebook’s statement</a> on its change of policy: </p> \n  <p>In light of ongoing investigations into the origin of Covid-19 and in consultation with public health experts, we will no longer remove the claim that COVID-19 is man-made or manufactured from our apps.

With more than 40% of the population of around 83m having received at least one dose, attention has turned to the question of extending vaccinations to adolescents. Chancellor Angela Merkel will later on Thursday discuss the question with the premiers of Germany’s 16 federal states, Reuters reports. Opinion is divided and Germany’s main expert panel on vaccinations has expressed caution. Some scientists say that, due to a lack of data on long-term effects, it might be better to vaccinate only adolescents with risk factors. A document made available before the talks made clear the government wants to push ahead and aims to have offered all 12-18 year olds at least a first shot by the end of August. Ireland’s deputy prime minister has said it is too soon to withdraw Covid related benefits that are still supporting more than 300,000 people who lost their jobs due to the pandemic, Reuters reports. Next week, ministers are due to decide whether to extend fiscal support beyond the end of June. Leo Varadkar has said the government would aim to allow firms and people time to reopen and recover in the third quarter with those payments. Russia’s Supreme Court has rejected a lawsuit from US company Gilead Sciences challenging the Russian government’s decision last year to let a Russian pharmaceutical firm develop the Covid drug remdesivir without Gilead’s consent. Pharmasyntez on Tuesday shipped a generic version of the drug - called Remdeform - to India as part of humanitarian aid contributions, Reuters reports. Reuters reports: Israel will release next week its findings on heart inflammation cases in Covid-19 vaccine recipients and then decide whether to approve inoculations of youngsters aged 12-15, a senior health official said on Thursday. Israel’s health ministry said in April it was examining a small number of such cases among people who received Pfizer/BioNtech’s PFE.N Covid-19 vaccine. The US Centers for Disease Control made a similar statement earlier this month. “We will release our final report which will say whether there really is a link to the vaccine and what the implications are,” said Sharon Alroy-Preis, the ministry’s head of public health. Once the report is made public next week, she told Army Radio: “we will issue the most responsible recommendation we can to Israelis, and of course, ultimately, it will be up to parents” to decide whether to vaccinate their children. Taiwan’s government has said that the first batch of 150,000 doses of Moderna Inc’s Covid vaccine would arrive on the island on Friday, Reuters reports. As noted earlier, Taiwan has reported 401 new local cases confirmed today, 13 deaths, and an additional 266 backlogged results from the previous week. It is an indicator that the island’s worst outbreak of the pandemic is still spreading consistently despite restrictions on social movement. Update on earlier post: Portuguese authorities have relaxed Covid safety rules for thousands of English fans coming to Porto for Saturday’s Champions League final, no longer requiring them to stay in bubbles and lifting restrictions on movement, Reuters reports. Porto police superintendent Cardoso da Silva told a news briefing: The borders are open. The city and the country are opening up little by little. Within what is possible, freedom (of movement) will not be conditioned. There are no restrictions of movement for fans. The Morrison government has come under attack over “failed” quarantine arrangements and the sluggish pace of the national vaccine rollout as Victoria enters a seven-day “circuit breaker” lockdown. There is mounting concern the latest virus wave could have become “uncontrollable” with almost 30 cases in the Melbourne-based cluster. The acting Victorian premier, James Merlino, on Thursday pointed to vaccine delays and “aged care facilities where not one person has been vaccinated” as practical problems in managing the response. Both are the responsibility of the federal government. You can read the full story by my colleagues Katharine Murphy and Sarah Martin here: Russia has administered at least one dose of a Covid vaccine to almost 17m people, the RIA news agency has cited health minister Mikhail Murashko as saying. The figure suggests Russia has given the first dose of one of its vaccines to about 3m people in the past two weeks. Deputy Prime Minister Tatiana Golikova said on 12 May that 14m Russians had received one vaccine dose, according to Reuters. Some of Russia’s regions have complained that the vaccination process is not going fast enough despite the country having begun rolling out its Sputnik V shot in December. This has been shared by ABC 7.30. In Australia, the Northern Territory government has said domestic arrivals from Melbourne’s highest risk exposure sites must self-isolate and get tested, rather than enter supervised quarantine at Howard Springs, a government run quarantine facility. Hello everyone, this is Yohannes Lowe. I’ll be running the blog until the evening (UK time). As always, feel free to get in touch on Twitter if you have any story tips. Joe Biden has ordered the US intelligence community to ‘redouble’ its efforts studying the origins of coronavirus, adding that it will continue to press for China to participate in a full investigation. China has pushed back, saying that the US “does not care about facts and truth, nor is it interested in serious scientific origin tracing.” Facebook is changing its policy to allow posts saying Covid is “man-made”. A statement from the US tech giant said “In light of ongoing investigations into the origin of Covid-19 and in consultation with public health experts, we will no longer remove the claim that Covid-19 is man-made or manufactured from our apps.” Japan pledged on Thursday to keep in close contact with Olympics stakeholders at home and abroad to ensure a safe and secure Games even as it prepared to extend a state of emergency across much of the nation, including host city Tokyo. The head of a Japanese doctors union warned holding the Olympic Games in Tokyo this summer, with tens of thousands of people gathering from around the world, could lead to the development of a new “Olympic” strain of the coronavirus. India is changing its approach to vaccines – announcing that it has scrapped local trials for “well-established” foreign coronavirus vaccines to fast-track imports. The government said it was in talks with Pfizer for “earliest possible” imports of its shots and that it had also had discussions with Johnson &amp; Johnson and Moderna. Taiwan has reported 401 new local cases confirmed today, 13 deaths, and an additional 266 backlogged results from the previous week, in a sign that the island’s worst outbreak of the pandemic is still spreading consistently despite restrictions on social movement. Taiwan’s president has accused China of interfering in its vaccine acquisition. President Tsai Ing-wen said Taiwan had made successful deals for AstraZeneca and Moderna, and were engaging with BioNTech for the Pfizer vaccine. “We had almost completed the contract signing with the German manufacturer at one point, but it has been delayed till now because China has interfered. Ireland’s health minister has said it was unclear whether enough supplies of Covid-19 vaccines would arrive in the country by the end of June to meet the government’s target of administering at least one dose to 82% of all adults. The European Commission demanded an urgent court order requiring AstraZeneca to deliver millions more vaccines to the bloc or face a hefty fine, in a case that may reflect its anger more than its need for doses. From 8am this morning, all adults in Northern Ireland have been able to book a vaccination. Switzerland is to re-open indoor restaurants and people will no longer be required to work from home, the government announced, saying it was lifting restrictions faster than previously planned. Two Covid-19 vaccines from China’s Sinopharm showed more than 70% efficacy against symptomatic cases, but it remains unclear how much protection they provide against severe or asymptomatic cases, according to the first detailed result of a large late-stage study published to the public. French pharmaceutical giant Sanofi and Britain’s GSK have announced the start of final tests of their belated Covid vaccine as they race to add their jab to the world’s arsenal against the pandemic. A major Australian retail group has been hit with $630,000 in fines for multiple breaches of consumer law related to pandemic-related health products, including hand sanitiser with alcohol levels far lower than advertised. British politics is almost entirely dominated today by responses to yesterday’s assertions by former government adviser Dominic Cummings about how the UK government handled the pandemic. Andrew Sparrow has the latest on our UK live blog… Yohannes Lowe will be with you shortly to take you through the rest of the day. In a not entirely unexpected move, China has this morning pushed back against new moves to investigate the origins of the novel coronavirus in Wuhan. It accused the Biden administration in the US of playing politics and shirking its responsibility in calling for a renewed investigation. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at a daily briefing that President Joe Biden’s order showed the US “does not care about facts and truth, nor is it interested in serious scientific origin tracing.” Biden told US intelligence officials to redouble their efforts to investigate the origins of the pandemic, including any possibility the trail might lead to a Chinese laboratory. After months of minimizing that possibility as a fringe theory, the Biden administration is joining worldwide pressure on China to be more open about the outbreak, in part aiming to head off domestic US complaints from Republican that the president has not been tough enough to press China on alleged obstruction. Regular watcher of US-China relations will know that in the daily press briefings Zhao usually has something to say about the US, and today has said the country must open itself up to investigations into its biological laboratories, including at the military’s Fort Detrick base. “The US side claims that it wants China to participate in a comprehensive, transparent, evidence-based international investigation,” Zhao said. “We would like to ask the US side to do the same as China and immediately cooperate with the World Health Organization on origin tracing research in a scientific manner.” Ireland’s health minister has said it was unclear whether enough supplies of Covid-19 vaccines would arrive in the country by the end of June to meet the government’s target of administering at least one dose to 82% of all adults. Half of Ireland’s 3.8 million adult population will have received at least one dose by the end of this week, Stephen Donnelly told parliament. But he cautioned that there was continued uncertainty around the arrival of AstraZeneca and in particular Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines. Reuters report that Ireland had been due to receive 600,000 shots of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s one-dose Janssen vaccine in the April-June period but only 26,400 shots had been delivered as of 9 May, with the vast majority set to be delivered next month. “For June we were contracted to receive about 470,000 doses of Janssen. The best case I have as of this morning is that we would receive about half of that and the worst case could be as low as around 60,000 in June,” Donnelly said. “With regards to AstraZeneca, we don’t know yet but as we know unfortunately, the supplies from AstraZeneca have consistently been under. The company has not been able to give detail as to how much it will be under for June.” Catarina Demony and Silvio Castellanos report from Porto that as thousands of English football fans flock to Portugal’s city of Porto for Saturday’s Champions League final, hotels and bars are hoping the tourism boost will be a prelude to their emergence from a collapse brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic. “It is definitely a boost for most hotels,” hotel general manager Francisco Brito told Reuters as a couple checked in behind him. “No one ever thought we could experience such a brutal hit ... it is a huge satisfaction to be back in business.” Portugal’s once-booming tourism sector suffered its worst results since the mid-1980s last year as Covid-19 grounded flights and kept visitors away. Tourism businesses across Porto have been mostly empty, leaving workers in a tight spot. Many were pushed into unemployment. Those who managed to stay afloat breathed a sigh of relief when this month UEFA moved the final from Istanbul to Porto’s Dragao Stadium after Turkey was added to the British government’s coronavirus travel-ban “red list”. Some of the city’s hotels were able to finally reopen as demand grew exponentially due to the match, Brito said. Although most of the 16,500 fans who will be allowed into the stadium will have to complete the trip within 24 hours of the final and remain in a bubble during their stay, many others have been travelling to Porto to support their teams from the sidelines. Olivier Ramadas, co-owner of sports bar Adega, said calls and emails from fans wanting to book a table for match day started pouring on the day of UEFA’s announcement. “When we received the news we felt a huge joy,” he said as English fans who arrived a few days early drank pints of beer and chatted. “It will revive the city.” Two Covid-19 vaccines from China’s Sinopharm showed more than 70% efficacy against symptomatic cases, but it remains unclear how much protection they provide against severe or asymptomatic cases, according to the first detailed result of a large late-stage study published to the public. A vaccine developed by a Wuhan-based subsidiary of Sinopharm was 72.8% effective against symptomatic COVID-19 at least two weeks after second injection, based on interim results, the peer-reviewed study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association showed on Wednesday. Reuters note that this is slightly better than the 72.5% rate announced in a company statement in February. Another vaccine developed by a Beijing-based institute linked to Sinopharm, which this month obtained emergency use approval by the World Health Organization, showed a 78.1% efficacy, the paper said. India is changing its approach to vaccines – announcing that it has scrapped local trials for “well-established” foreign coronavirus vaccines to fast-track imports. The country has been inoculating its people with the AstraZeneca vaccine produced locally at the Serum Institute, Covaxin made by local firm Bharat Biotech, and has begun rolling out Russia’s Sputnik V. But supplies are far short of the millions of doses the world’s second-most populous country needs. The government said it was in talks with Pfizer for “earliest possible” imports of its shots and that it had also had discussions with Johnson &amp; Johnson and Moderna. Last month, India pledged to fast-track approvals for foreign vaccines but its insistence on local trials was a key reason for stalled discussions with Pfizer. “The provision has now been further amended to waive the trial requirement altogether for the well-established vaccines manufactured in other countries,” the government said in a statement. None of drugmakers has sent in applications for approval with India’s drugs regulator, it said. Reuters have reported that desperate Indian states have been launching global tenders or seeking expressions of interest from firms including Pfizer and Moderna, but vaccine makers said they would only talk with the federal government. The government said supplies were tight. “The fact that global tenders have not given any results only reaffirms what we have been telling the states from day one: that vaccines are in short supply in the world and it is not easy to procure them at short notice,” it said. Andrew Sparrow is up and running for the day with our UK Covid live blog, so the latest fall-out from the Dominic Cummings revelations will be with him over there, and I’ll be continuing with global coronavirus news here. Indonesia has resumed usage of a temporarily suspended batch of AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine, the country’s food and drug agency (BPOM) said this morning. Reuters report that the agency suspended use of one batch of the vaccine to conduct an investigation after a young man died after being inoculated earlier this month. “According to test results, it can be concluded that there was no relation between the quality of Covid-19 vaccine batch number CTMAV547 with the post immunization event reported,” said BPOM. The hotline for booking a Covid-19 vaccine in Australia was unavailable for hours following the Victorian government’s decision to open up vaccinations to those aged over 40. As the acting premier, James Merlino, announced Victoria would go into a seven-day lockdown to get on top of a growing number of cases of Covid-19, he announced people aged between 40 and 49 would be able to get the Pfizer vaccine at state-run clinics from Friday. Merlino said it would be a matter for the federal government on whether the vaccine would be available for those in that age group at GP surgeries, but said the decision was arrived at due to frustration over the slow pace of the vaccine rollout. “If we had the vaccine, the commonwealth’s vaccine program effectively rolled out, we may well not be here today talking about these circuit-breaker restrictions that we must impose to keep our community safe.” Read more here: Victoria’s hotline for booking Covid vaccines crashes after being inundated with calls Joe Biden has ordered the US intelligence community to ‘redouble’ its efforts studying the origins of coronavirus, adding that it will continue to press for China to participate in a full investigation. The deputy White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre confirmed the investigation would include any possibility the trail might lead to a Chinese lab. “China wasn’t transparent enough,” she said. “We have been saying that for a very long time, that China needed to provide more access to the lab, cooperate more fully with the scientific investigators.” Adam Taylor at the Washington Post has this to say about the re-emergence of theories about a Wuhan lab leak being the source of the novel coronavirus. He writes: Well over a year since a novel coronavirus began to spread in Wuhan, the idea that the deadly outbreak could be linked to a virus research center in the Chinese city has lingered, unproven but not eliminated. Although the resurgent chatter may suggest new clues or proof, the inverse is in fact true. It is the persistent absence of any convincing evidence either for or against the theory that has prompted calls for more investigation. At least publicly, the evidence in favor of a link between the outbreak and the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) has not changed significantly in months, and many virologists still have persistent doubts that such a link exists. What has clearly changed, however, is the political debate. Most obviously, a new U.S. administration that is not so openly anti-China has led some former skeptics to reconsider the existing evidence. And public health experts — most of whom never ruled out the lab theory outright — have expressed disappointment with a World Health Organization-backed investigation that dismissed a link between WIV and the outbreak. Read more here: Washington Post – The Wuhan lab-leak theory is getting more attention. That’s because key evidence is still missing A major Australian retail group has been hit with $630,000 in fines for multiple breaches of consumer law related to pandemic-related health products, including hand sanitiser with alcohol levels far lower than advertised, the consumer watchdog has announced. Mosaic Brands Limited, an ASX-listed retail conglomerate that counts Katies, Rivers, Noni B and Rockmans among its stable of brands, has admitted to making false or misleading claims pertaining to hand sanitiser and face mask products between March and June 2020. The deputy chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, Delia Rickard, said they were particularly concerned about the misleading claims because they were made during a global pandemic. The fines come following tests by Choice, which found that the group was selling hand sanitiser with alcohol levels far lower than advertised. Choice issued a complaint to the ACCC, which conducted independent tests and found “one of the sanitisers tested contained an alcohol content of 17% and another had an alcohol content of 58%, below the percentage advertised on Mosaic Brands’ websites in each case. This was also below the minimum 60% alcohol concentration recommended by Australian health authorities,” Rickard said. Read more here: Australian retailer Mosaic Brands fined $630,000 for misleading hand sanitiser claims UK housing minister Robert Jenrick must be thrilled he got the job of facing the media this morning. He’s just had Susanna Reid open his section with the simple question: “Where is the prime minister this morning?” Zachary Wolf at CNN had this an analysis overnight on how the US government now sees the search for the origins of the global pandemic as an intelligence-led operation. He writes: Intel operation, not scientific inquiry. Biden wants the intelligence community to cooperate with other elements of the government, but getting to the bottom of how this disease occurred, at least in the eyes of the president dealing with obstruction from China, is now fully an intelligence operation. But that order likely poses a complicated challenge for intelligence agencies, which, as CNN has repeatedly reported, are limited in their ability to confidently answer the question of what actually happened. While the intelligence community has been actively engaged on the issue since it broke, Biden’s order is a public call for more, despite the fact that it has been unable to make significant progress for more than a year. So it’s the CIA, not the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that the government is now looking to. And it’s the scientists, who were adamant a year ago that the lab theory was extremely unlikely, now saying it needs more exploration. That appears to be what caused this change. But while intelligence professionals have been more cautious in characterizing their own findings, the lack of apparent progress over the last year should temper expectations, especially considering that China is uninterested or unwilling to help any effort aimed at discovering the truth. Read more here: CNN – The origin of Covid is now an intelligence operation Taiwan has reported 401 new local cases confirmed today, 13 deaths, and an additional 266 backlogged results from the previous week, in a sign that the island’s worst outbreak of the pandemic is still spreading consistently despite restrictions on social movement. Among the 13 deaths - the highest daily toll for Taiwan so far - was a woman in her 40s. Health and welfare minister Chen Chih-Shung said most of the fatalities were elderly people. More than half of the new cases were in people under the age of 40, including 45 children aged up to nine. The new cases remain concentrated in the northern cities of New Taipei and Taipei. Issues with Taiwan’s test recording system has resulted in a backlog of thousands of results, with clearance work producing hundreds of cases to revised totals each day, making it difficult to determine clear trends. The number of backlogged cases is reportedly still growing as more tests come in, despite clearance efforts. Taiwan remains under a level 3 alert, which is not a full lockdown but instead restricts personal gatherings to five indoors and 10 outdoors, encourages but does not require working from home, and which has ordered entertainment and recreation venues to close. Yesterday restaurants were ordered to transition to takeaway services only. Alarmed by their first significant outbreak since the pandemic began, Taiwan’s population has largely complied with both mandatory and requested restrictions, staying home and avoiding travel. Almost 1500 people are in centralised quarantine facilities, established for people with asymptomatic or mild cases of Covid-19 to reduce pressure on hospitals - several of which have recorded their own clusters of infections. Chen has said Taiwan will only move to level 4 alert - a lockdown - if there are 14 consecutive days of more than 100 cases (a milestone likely to be reached tomorrow), with 50% untraced (which has not been reached - just 145 of the total caseload remain unsourced). “I’m just off to drive forward the vaccine programme and then I’ll be going to the House of Commons and I’ll answer questions there.” That’s UK health minister Matt Hancock leaving his house this morning, being asked if the country can still have confidence in him. It was a suit today, not his running gear like yesterday. As you might expect, UK health secretary Matt Hancock is to respond today to those accusations by Dominic Cummings yesterday that he repeatedly lied and that he should have been fired 15 or 20 times over his handling of the early days of the pandemic. Hancock is to answer urgent questions in parliament at 10.30am and will later lead a Downing Street press conference, likely to be around 17.00. French pharmaceutical giant Sanofi and Britain’s GSK have announced the start of final tests of their belated Covid vaccine as they race to add their jab to the world’s arsenal against the pandemic. AFP state that the companies reported positive results from interim human trials earlier this month after a disappointing outcome from initial studies last year left France without its own vaccine. Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline have started enrolment for Phase 3 of a clinical study that will include more than 35,000 adult volunteers at sites in the United States, Asia, Africa and Latin America, the firms said. Sanofi and GSK will also study their vaccine’s ability to work as a booster shot in people who had previously received another vaccine. The Phase 2 trials already showed a strong immune response after a single shot in participants who had previously contracted the coronavirus. The companies hope to launch their vaccine by the end of 2021 - one year after Pfizer and Moderna jabs were approved by regulators. “We have adapted our vaccine development strategy based on forward-looking considerations as the virus continues to evolve, as well as anticipating what may be needed in a post-pandemic setting,” Sanofi executive vice president Thomas Triomphe said in a statement. Like most of the other jabs in circulation, the Sanofi-GSK vaccine would require two doses. Taiwan’s president has accused China of interfering in its vaccine acquisition, as the island continues to battle hundreds of daily new cases of Covid-19 with low supplies of vaccines. Taiwan has received about 700,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine so far, for a population of 24 million. While the island had been largely Covid-free since the pandemic began, an outbreak in late April has so far infected more than 5,000 people, and killed at least 47. Less than 2% of the population are vaccinated. President Tsai Ing-wen said Taiwan had made successful deals for AstraZeneca from the UK and Moderna from the US, and were engaging with Germany’s BioNTech for the Pfizer vaccine. “We had almost completed the contract signing with the German manufacturer at one point, but it has been delayed till now because China has interfered,” Tsai told a party meeting on Wednesday, in the most explicit comments to date, after months of suggestions that Beijing had been getting in the way of Taiwan’s procurement process. Pfizer-BioNTech reportedly has an exclusive deal with the Shanghai-based Fosun pharmaceuticals company to distribute the vaccine to the Greater China region, including Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan. Fosun has offered to supply Taiwan with vaccine doses, but Taiwan has said it is not possible. Beijing denies obstructing Taiwan’s deal with BioNtech and has accused Taiwan’s leaders of sacrificing the health of residents for politics. Taiwan’s opposition Kuomintang party has accused Tsai of bungling the vaccine rollout. “Taiwan access to vaccines continues to be slowed down by Chinese interference, while they insist we buy Chinese-made ones,” said Taiwan’s presidential spokeswoman, Kolas Yotaka. “If you really want to help, please don’t stand in the doorway, don’t block up the hall.” Read more here: Taiwan accuses China of interfering with Covid vaccine deals Professor Susan Michie has ben on Sky News. She is a clinical psychologist at UCL. She described the lack of action and feedback from the UK government on scientific advice as “demoralising” and said that yesterday Dominic Cummings presented a “depressing” picture. She said: As a scientist, spending a lot of my last year, along with many other colleagues, thinking about science, writing about science, providing scientific advice on top of our day jobs, it is quite depressing to think that all that work, and all the many reports that we’ve produced weren’t landing, and possibly weren’t being considered. She went on to say: I think one of the frustrations about having given scientific advice over this last year is that there isn’t feedback … whether it was rejected because it wasn’t thought to be good, or maybe there are other political priorities. One never really knows what the explanation is when the advice we give isn’t being implemented. And I think that’s a shame because I think it’s quite demoralising for scientists. She also made a value for money argument about scientific advice being sidelined, saying: “I think it’s important for the public to know how taxpayers money is being spent, because obviously there’s a substantial expense to serving a big scientific infrastructure.” Professor Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College London, whose modelling was instrumental in persuading the UK government to bring in the first lockdown, said scientists had become increasingly concerned in the week leading up to 13 March 2020 about the lack of a clear plan, and 20,000 to 30,000 lives could have been saved with earlier action. Asked on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme when the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), of which he was part, determined that a policy of pursuing herd immunity would lead to a vast number of deaths, he said a key meeting was held with the NHS on 1 March “which finalised estimates around health impacts, so the week after that really.” PA report Ferguson said he “wasn’t privy to what officials were thinking within government”, but added: “I would say from the scientific side there was increasing concern that week leading up to the 13 of March about the lack of clear, let’s say, (a) resolved plan of what would happen in the next few days in terms of implementing social distancing.” He said: “I think one of the biggest lessons to learn in such circumstances is we really need good surveillance within the country at a much earlier point than we actually had it back in March last year. As we saw the data build up, and it was matching the modelling, even worse than the modelling, let’s say it focused minds”. He then said locking down a week earlier would have saved 20,000 to 30,000 lives “and I think that’s unarguable. I mean the epidemic was doubling every three to four days in weeks 13th to 23rd of March, and so had we moved the interventions back a week we would have curtailed that and saved many lives”. Needless to say, lockdown sceptic Fraser Nelson, editor of the Spectator, is having none of it. From 8am this morning, all adults in Northern Ireland will be able to book a vaccination. Health Minister Robin Swann said: “I am delighted that our vaccination programme is now open to all adults in Northern Ireland. I know this will be very welcome news for young people who have been waiting patiently for their turn to get the jab.” You can check on the latest status of vaccination in all of the UK’s constituent countries here: NHS England NHS Scotland Gov.wales Northern Ireland As part of UK housing minister Robert Jenrick’s media round this morning, he is repeatedly trying to bat away accusations from former adviser Dominic Cummings by saying there will be a full inquiry in due course. This, in turn, is leading to him being pressed on the timing of that. He has roughly indicated “next spring”. The head of a Japanese doctors union on Thursday warned holding the Olympic Games in Tokyo this summer, with tens of thousands of people gathering from around the world, could lead to the development of a new “Olympic” strain of the coronavirus. With people from over 200 nations and territories set to arrive in Tokyo, it will be dangerous to host the Games in July, said Naoto Ueyama, head of the Japan Doctors Union. “All of the different mutant strains of the virus which exist in different places will be concentrated and gathering here in Tokyo. We cannot deny the possibility of even a new strain of the virus potentially emerging after the Olympics,” he told a news conference. “If such a situation were to arise, it could even mean a Tokyo Olympic strain of the virus being named in this way, which would be a huge tragedy and something which would be the target of criticism even for 100 years.” Japan pledged on Thursday to keep in close contact with Olympics stakeholders at home and abroad to ensure a safe and secure Games even as it prepared to extend a state of emergency across much of the nation, including host city Tokyo. Concerns remain rife about the safety of the 2020 Olympics, postponed for a year due to the coronavirus pandemic, with public opinion polls showing a majority of Japanese are opposed to holding the Games this summer amid struggles to control a fourth wave of the coronavirus and sluggish vaccine rollout. Elaine Lies reports for Reuters that the government is currently preparing to extend a state of emergency across much of the nation originally set to be lifted on 31 May, most likely well into June, officials have said - just weeks before the Games are set to open on 23 July. Earlier this week, the United States advised against travel to Japan, but Olympics organisers have said this will not affect the Games. The White House on Wednesday said it had been assured by the Japanese government that it will keep in close contact about concerns over the Olympics. Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato said Japan would continue making every effort to control the virus irrespective of the Olympics, and would be in close contact with concerned parties at home and abroad about the measures being taken in connection with the Games. “Careful anti-infection measures are a crucial part of being able to deliver a safe and secure event,” he told a news conference. “We will maintain close and periodic contact with all those concerned, both within the country and without, to explain what we’re doing on this score.” Robert Jenrick is the UK government minister out on media duties this morning – you can’t imagine he’s going to asked about anything else at all except Dominic Cummings. He’s just been on Sky News where he got quite an abrasive questioning and wasn’t exactly effusive in his defence of health secretary Matt Hancock. Asked if Hancock had lied repeatedly, as Cummings asserted yesterday, Jenrick fell back on standard lines about vaccine rollout and didn’t really address the question. He was pressed: “It’s no good you appearing on this programme if you are not prepared to answer questions, and with the greatest of respect, we’ve heard all about what the government’s doing with the rollout and we hear that every single day. But what people will take from your response to that first answer is you’re not prepared to back the health secretary. Why not?” Jenrick again responded with a fairly generic line, saying “I think that the department for health and the health secretary, have worked exceptionally hard over the course of this pandemic. This was an unprecedented situation, it was a national effort involving all parts of government, and all parts of the country. I think the public will appreciate, if you think back to the events of this time last year, how challenging it really was. Many things happen, of course they’ll be things which we could have done better and we’re learning those lessons as we go along. “The public inquiry will air that and hear the evidence in a reasoned and reflective manner. I think that is the right way to do that. But absolutely, I think the country responded phenomenally to the events of last year. My point was that we are still responding to the pandemic, and that has to be the focus of government right now.” You can watch it here: Alexander Britton at PA has had a quick whizz round the British newspapers to gauge their reactions to the testimony yesterday of former UK government adviser Dominic Cummings on the early days of handling the Covid pandemic. The Independent, i and Daily Mirror all use the same quote headline: “Tens of thousands died who didn’t need to die”, with the latter carrying a leader column headlined “damning testimony”. The paper points out the problem of only hearing one side of the story, but that the Government “failed in this fundamental duty”. It says: “Cummings’ evidence may have been one-sided and selective but it should not be ignored. His criticisms of the Government’s handling of Covid demand an explanation. “The coward Johnson is trying to hide from accountability by delaying the public inquiry into Covid until next spring. We need to learn lessons now, not at his convenience.” The Daily Telegraph takes a different angle, suggesting an element of revenge from Cummings with associate editor Camilla Tominey writing “having expended his nine lives in government, this was also about settling scores”. The Sun’s headline - “Do you need a hindsight test, Mr Cummings?” - pokes fun at his well-publicised trip to Barnard Castle during the pandemic, while its leader column claims Mr Johnson will “dodge Dom’s bombs”. It adds people “recognise that our Government was one of many whose Covid response was found wanting. “The key difference since being the stellar success of our world-leading vaccine rollout. Voters are more likely to credit the Government with that and our rosier future than rake over the terrible bleakness of 2020 and the chaos in Downing Street.” Melbourne’s newest major arts festival, Rising, has been thrown into turmoil the day after opening with the Victorian government announcing a seven-day statewide lockdown from Thursday night. The hotly anticipated winter arts festival opened on Wednesday after an extended wait, only to “hit pause” on Thursday as the city entered a “circuit-breaker” lockdown that closed indoor and outdoor entertainment and arts venues and prohibited public gatherings. The acting premier, James Merlino, announced the lockdown on Thursday morning to halt the spread of what he called a “highly infectious” Covid-19 variant, spreading “faster than ever recorded”. Rising was due to run until Sunday 6 June. At the time of writing, the lockdown was scheduled to run until Friday 4 June. In response to the public health directive, Rising cancelled all events from 5pm Thursday until 4 June and committed to issuing refunds for all tickets for that period. “A decision in relation to events scheduled between 4 June and 6 June will be made over the coming week,” a statement issued by the festival said. Rising had been initially scheduled for 2020 but was cancelled due to the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, which hit Melbourne particularly hard, sending the city into back-to-back lockdowns that extended from March until October, and into a third snap lockdown earlier this year. Read more of Stephanie Convery’s report here: Rising festival ‘hits pause’ the day after opening as Melbourne enters lockdown Good morning from London, it is Martin Belam here. I’ll be with you for the next few hours. We’ve just published this from Dr Deepti Gurdasani, who is a clinical epidemiologist and senior lecturer in machine learning at Queen Mary University of London: Amid the select committee revelations from Dominic Cummings, and in his recent claims on social media, there has been a lot of focus on suggestions that the UK government was following a “herd immunity” policy at the start of the pandemic, costing thousands of lives in the process. Of course, none of this is surprising. It is very clear that this was the flawed policy of the government through early March last year, not least because it was publicly discussed by the prime minister and by many scientific advisers to the government – including Patrick Vallance, who spoke of “enough people becoming immune to this” with mild illness, to help build herd immunity. The alternative strategy of high suppression or elimination of the virus was rejected by the government very early on, despite strong evidence from other countries around the world showing that this could be successfully applied. There were several elements that underpinned the devastating herd immunity strategy. It was believed that infection of large swathes of the population was inevitable, and acceptable, and that there was no way to prevent it. This came with the tacit acknowledgment that hundreds of thousands of deaths were acceptable, most of which would occur among vulnerable and elderly people. A sense of national exceptionalism held by some suggested that other countries’ experiences didn’t apply to us – despite that by March we had had months to observe and learn from countries in south Asia, and seeing the devastating impact of late action in Italy. Real-world evidence was ignored in favour of models and flawed thinking. The government’s strategy repeatedly conflated Covid-19 with flu, ignoring the much higher transmissibility, higher susceptibility, which would lead to many more people getting infected and dying, and unknown long-term impacts from a novel virus. Finally, there was the idea that the health of the economy needed to be balanced with public health. A lot of emphasis was placed on the disruption lockdowns would cause, with attempts to slow down such decisions, without understanding that delays would inevitably lead to even longer lockdowns and more economic damage. Read more here: Deepti Gurdasani – The UK government’s Covid strategy was discredited but we’re still paying the price This is Facebook’s statement on its change of policy: In light of ongoing investigations into the origin of Covid-19 and in consultation with public health experts, we will no longer remove the claim that COVID-19 is man-made or manufactured from our apps. We’re continuing to work with health experts to keep pace with the evolving nature of the pandemic and regularly update our policies as new facts and trends emerge. In February this year, the World Health Organization team that visited Wuhan to investigate the origins of the coronavirus pandemic all but dismissed a theory that the virus leaked from a laboratory. But their investigation was inconclusive as to what the origins of the theory actually were, and the theory that the virus was manufactured in a laboratory and escaped accidentally has again been raised in recent days as the United States and other countries call for a more in-depth investigation of the pandemic’s origins. Determining how the virus that causes Covid-19 began spreading is seen as vital to preventing future outbreaks. A long-delayed report by the team of international experts sent to Wuhan and their Chinese counterparts drew no firm conclusions as to the origins of the pandemic. Instead, they ranked a number of hypotheses according to how likely they believed they were. The report said the virus jumping from bats to humans via an intermediate animal was the most probable scenario, while it said a theory involving the virus leaking from a laboratory was “extremely unlikely”. After the report was released, however, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus insisted all theories remained on the table. On Wednesday, Joe Biden has ordered the US intelligence community to intensify its efforts to study the origins of coronavirus, adding that it will continue to press for China to participate in a full investigation. Biden’s request included asking the US intelligence community to explore the unlikely possibility that the origins of the virus trace to Chinese lab. After months of minimizing the possibility as a fringe theory, the Biden administration is responding both to domestic and geopolitical concerns about putting pressure on China to be transparent about the outbreak.. After months of minimizing the possibility as a fringe theory, the Biden administration is responding both to domestic and geopolitical concerns about putting pressure on China to be transparent about the outbreak. Hello and welcome to our ongoing live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. Facebook has lifted a ban on posts claiming that Covid-19 was “man-made” or “manufactured” in “In light of ongoing investigations into the origin of Covid and in consultation with public health experts”. Here are the other key recent developments: Johnson &amp; Johnson’s single-shot Covid vaccine is to be limited in Belgium to people aged 41 and over, authorities said following the death of a woman who received the jab. Switzerland is to re-open indoor restaurants and people will no longer be required to work from home, the government announced, saying it was lifting restrictions faster than previously planned. China accused the US of “spreading conspiracy theories and disinformation” after health chief Anthony Fauci said he was no longer convinced the coronavirus originated naturally – propelling the theory that it emerged from a Wuhan laboratory back into mainstream debate. The European Commission demanded an urgent court order requiring AstraZeneca to deliver millions more vaccines to the bloc or face a hefty fine, in a case that may reflect its anger more than its need for doses. Slovakia became the second EU country to authorise the use of the Russian-made Sputnik V Covid vaccine, which has not yet been approved by the bloc’s drug regulator. France will impose a compulsory quarantine on travellers arriving from the UK because of growing concerns over the spread of the Indian variant of the coronavirus, the government’s spokesman has said. Whistleblower protection groups urged the World Health Organization to launch an independent review into the case of an Italian researcher who reported being pressured to falsify data in a now-spiked WHO report into Italy’s coronavirus response. Perhaps conveniently for an incumbent candidate, Zambian president Edgar Lungu banned campaign rallies ahead of elections scheduled for 12 August, saying large gatherings risked spreading the Covid-19 virus. Vets in several parts of Russia reportedly started vaccinating cats against Covid-19. Russia in March said it had registered the world’s first coronavirus vaccine for animals. Only two animals in Russia, both cats, have so far tested positive for the virus.","charCount":"47623","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/yohannes-lowe\">Yohannes Lowe</a> (now), <a href=\"profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a> and <a href=\"profile/helen-sullivan\">Helen Sullivan</a> (earlier)"},{"headline":"Membership of UK trade unions rises for fourth year in a row","standfirst":"<p>Increase of 228,000 in public sector offset by decline of 110,000 among private sector workers</p>","trailText":"Increase of 228,000 in public sector offset by decline of 110,000 among private sector workers","byline":"Larry Elliott Economics editor","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"56e25743abb84b8710451440d7ce2deb2f79debb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/56e25743abb84b8710451440d7ce2deb2f79debb/0_0_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"TUC march, London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People take part in a TUC march in central London.

Norfolk had links with Northamptonshire and was invited down for a couple of sessions with David Ripley, who was in charge of their academy at that time. They liked the look of me, I kept going back and it went from there.” </p> <p> “On a couple of occasions I have been coming back from injuries and playing for Norfolk has been a good stepping stone in my rehab.

Back in half an hour! Group One Riverside: Durham v Essex 91-3 Edgbaston: Warwickshire 78-2 v Nottinghamshire New Road: Worcestershire 98-3 v Derbyshire Group Two Grace Road: Leicestershire v Middlesex 73-1 The Oval: Surrey 77-1 v Gloucestershire Group Three Old Trafford: Lancashire v Yorkshire 57-7 Hove: Sussex 67-7 v Northants Thompson fends desperately at a short ball from Wood, and it carries to Keaton Jennings at short leg - just positioned by Vilas. Happy days for Lancashire. Yorkshire 40-7. Some nice quotes by Olly Stone on playing for Norfolk. Stone first played cricket for his local club Vauxhall Mallards, near Norwich, his first junior county cricket for Norfolk - who recommended him to Northamptonshire – and his formative senior county cricket for Norfolk in the Minor Counties Championship – now National Counties Championship – ten years ago. And despite his Warwickshire and England commitments, Stone has carried on playing for Norfolk whenever he can. “Norfolk have played a massive part in my development but it’s not just me, there are other good young cricketers who have come out of the county,” Stone said.“I started playing cricket because my brothers played but I got into the Norfolk age group sides and then it became a bit more serious. “It was Steve Goldsmith who said that if took it seriously then I had a chance of progressing. Norfolk had links with Northamptonshire and was invited down for a couple of sessions with David Ripley, who was in charge of their academy at that time. They liked the look of me, I kept going back and it went from there.” “On a couple of occasions I have been coming back from injuries and playing for Norfolk has been a good stepping stone in my rehab. It’s a chance to give something back to Norfolk but I also enjoy it. A lot of the current team I grew up with so it’s a friendly and familiar atmosphere.” Duke, in his second Yorkshire game, is only 19. If he could just creep to double figures, to 25, to 50, what a game this would be. Yorkshire 36-6. Duke leans back and glides Wood to the boundary. Sweet. Yorkshire 31-6. Warwicks have lost Rob Yates for a slow 8, but Will Rhodes is steaming ahead, 34 not out. Warwicks 46-1. Pepper and Walter have put on 42 in quick time, Essex 82-3. Jake Libby, carelessly, has been run out, leaving Worcestershire 81-3. Robson and Eskinazi have put on fifty at Grace Road, as have Stoneman and Patel at The Oval. Sussex are 55 -5- 6 ! Ahem. 21-6. Bess cuts to gully - and why not? - where a delighted Danny Lamb accepts, jumps into his teammates arms, and Yorkshire are 21-5. Yorkshire’s lowest total at Old Trafford in a Championship match is 51. Whistles innocently. A drop falls through the hands of first slip, and Kohler Cadmore gets a second life. Yorkshire 20-4. “Greetings from sunny - when isn’t it? - Edgbaston, where spectators are back and delivering the sweet, sweet sound of applause after an 18-month silence at the ground. No early look at Haseeb Hameed after his call-up to the England squad but Notttinghamshire’s opening bowlers are probing away nicely. Will Rhodes, the Warwickshire captain, has already been given a life on six too: Luke Fletcher finding the edge of the lefthander’s bat, only for Tom Moores to put it down diving to his left. Tough chance. After running through Worcestershire like a bull through Pamplona, Fletcher looks in a fine groove, while Zak Chapple has got some lavish swing at the other end. But Rhodes and Rob Yates are holding firm on 28 for no loss after 12 overs.” Hard to glance away from this Yorks-up but, an hour in, a peek round the grounds. Easy pickings for Warwicks (32-0); Middlesex (33-0) and Surrey (36-0). Worcestershire have recovered from 21-2, Libby 24 not out, Hayes 18 not out. 56-2/ Ben Sanderson has snatched three for 16 against wobbling Sussex, 32-4; and Browne and Westley have joined SirAlastair back in the pavilion at The Riverside, Essex 49-3. Let’s keep it cheeky Yorkshire - why not?. Hill prods awkwardly and is caught for 2 off Tom Bailey. Lovely bit of bowling; nervous bit of batting. Yorkshire 11-4. A foolish single ends in disaster: Brook is slow to respond to Kohler Cadmore’s call, fatally hesitates, and is the victim of a direct hit from Davies. Yorkshire 9-3. A satisfied hum starts to rise above Old Trafford. A second for Mahmood! A sensational ball in a smashing spell as a disconsolate Fraine totters head-down back to the pavilion. I don’t think it is unjust to say that Lancashire’s “second string” bowlers are better than Yorkshire’s “second string” batters. Elsewhere, Daryl Mitchell has been lbw to Conners without a run to his name. Not a pretty season for him so far. Worcestershire 19-1. Sussex have lost Aaron Thomason to Ben Sanderson for four. Sussex 12-1. And another early exit for Alastair Cook, lbw to Chris Rushworth for 2, Essex 25-1. And that IS out! Adam Lyth smartly caught by Danny Lamb off Tom Bailey for 4 . A fragile batting line up is cracked open. Billowing clouds peep above the pavilion, as Mahmood has the ball, running in with four slips, Dane Vilas still keeping because Al Davies’ fingers are sore. Lancashire haven’t beaten Yorkshire at home since 2000, when Sourav Ganguly and Darren Lehman were the overseas players. Ah - I think Liam Livingstone just dropped Kohler-Cadmore on 0 off Mahmood.

Relative to the MPC’s central projection, I worry that the transition out of furlough does involve a modest rise in the unemployment rate, while the economy’s supply potential is somewhat less adversely affected, so that there is still some excess supply around the turn of the year.</p> <p>In that scenario, the first rise in Bank Rate is likely to become appropriate only well into next year, with some modest further tightening thereafter. </p> </blockquote> <p>However, a hike earlier in 2022 could be appropriate... <strong>if </strong>there is a smaller increase in job losses, putting upward pressure on inflation and wages, he adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On the upside, should the transition out of furlough happen more smoothly, with the unemployment rate at or a little below current levels by the end of the year, with associated signs of upward inflation and wage pressure beyond the temporary and base effects, then a somewhat earlier rise in Bank Rate would be appropriate.</p> <p>It would probably take until the first quarter of next year to have a clear view of the post-furlough unemployment and wage dynamics, so a rise in Bank Rate could be appropriate soon after, along a slightly steeper path than in my central case.</p> </blockquote> <p>This seems to have given sterling a lift - it’s now up half a cent at $1.4177 against the US dollar, back towards </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PriapusIQ/status/1397874277966352384\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">📈 GBP liking something, not sure anything Vlieghe said warrants the jolt higher though. <a href=\"https://t.co/TVuxFcDzZb\">pic.twitter.com/TVuxFcDzZb</a></p>&mdash; PiQ (@PriapusIQ) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PriapusIQ/status/1397874277966352384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 27, 2021</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The pound is also up around 0.3% against the euro, at €1.1616.</p> <p>Vlieghe’s MPC term ends in August, but these comments may also give an insight into how the committee are seeing the situation, points out DailyFX.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DailyFXTeam/status/1397875340719144964\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">While Vlieghe is leaving the BoE.

A low neutral interest rate will remain relevant once the Covid shock has passed. If anything, Covid may have lowered it by increasing the perception of tail risks.</p> <p>So if interest rates do need to rise once the data show that medium-term inflationary pressures are rising, then I suspect that interest rates will not need to rise very much to slow the economy to a pace that is consistent with our 2% inflation target. </p> </blockquote> <p>Here’s the speech:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bankofengland/status/1397877193615843336\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Gertjan Vlieghe talks about the rise in government bond yields.

In a lecture at the University of Bath, Vlieghe said his central forecast is that the first rate rise (from the current record low of 0.1%) would come “well into” 2022, given unemployment is likely to rise as the furlough scheme ends. Vlieghe, who is one of the external members of the Monetary Policy Committee, says: My central scenario is that the economy evolves similarly to the MPC’s central projection in May, but with somewhat more slack than in the central projection. Relative to the MPC’s central projection, I worry that the transition out of furlough does involve a modest rise in the unemployment rate, while the economy’s supply potential is somewhat less adversely affected, so that there is still some excess supply around the turn of the year. In that scenario, the first rise in Bank Rate is likely to become appropriate only well into next year, with some modest further tightening thereafter. However, a hike earlier in 2022 could be appropriate... if there is a smaller increase in job losses, putting upward pressure on inflation and wages, he adds: On the upside, should the transition out of furlough happen more smoothly, with the unemployment rate at or a little below current levels by the end of the year, with associated signs of upward inflation and wage pressure beyond the temporary and base effects, then a somewhat earlier rise in Bank Rate would be appropriate. It would probably take until the first quarter of next year to have a clear view of the post-furlough unemployment and wage dynamics, so a rise in Bank Rate could be appropriate soon after, along a slightly steeper path than in my central case. This seems to have given sterling a lift - it’s now up half a cent at $1.4177 against the US dollar, back towards The pound is also up around 0.3% against the euro, at €1.1616. Vlieghe’s MPC term ends in August, but these comments may also give an insight into how the committee are seeing the situation, points out DailyFX. Vlieghe also warned that new Covid-19 variants could slow the recovery (as our Covid Crisis Watch series warned). That could prompt new stimulus - which could include negative interest rates. He says: On the downside, the economy might not recover as quickly, perhaps as lingering concerns about “variants of concern” continue to weigh on demand, which in turn results in more adverse unemployment dynamics as fewer furloughed workers are hired back straight away, with weaker underlying wage pressure. In that case, it is still possible that monetary policy might be required to simulate the economy a little further to help eliminate slack and ensure inflation, after its temporary rise later this year, does not subsequently fall back below its 2% target persistently. This chart from Vlieghe’s speech shows how these scenarios could play out: Vlieghe also points out that the “neutral rate of interest” (the rate at which monetary policy is neither stimulating nor slowing the economy) is very low relative to the past several decades, and probably even lower due to the pandemic. In other words, rates are unlikely to rise significantly to keep inflation on target, he explains: That was apparent before we were hit by the Covid shock, when Bank Rate was just 0.75% and inflation pressures were too weak. A low neutral interest rate will remain relevant once the Covid shock has passed. If anything, Covid may have lowered it by increasing the perception of tail risks. So if interest rates do need to rise once the data show that medium-term inflationary pressures are rising, then I suspect that interest rates will not need to rise very much to slow the economy to a pace that is consistent with our 2% inflation target. Here’s the speech: UK bed and mattress retailer Dreams is being bought by US bedding giant Tempur Sealy in a £340 deal, from private equity Sun European Partners. The deal comes eight years after Sun took Dreams out of administration for £23m, after it collapsed with the loss of 400 jobs. Since then, CEO Mike Logue has been pushing a turnaround plan - pitching Dreams as an ‘sleep experts’, and also introducing smaller, brighter stores, new fleet of delivery vans and a sizeable investment in ecommerce. Logue says the deal is a ‘milestone’ for Dreams. “We are delighted to be joining the Tempur Sealy family. Today marks a milestone for Dreams. It is recognition of the transformation we have delivered, and is an endorsement of our customer-focused strategy, our culture and our values. With Tempur Sealy we expect to drive our growth strategy and build on our position as the most recommended, specialist bed retailer. I would like to take this opportunity to thank our 2,000 colleagues for their hard work, dedication and commitment. Together we will continue to improve what we make, sell and deliver, to provide better sleep for all our customers.” Here’s George MacDonald of Retail Week on the deal: Airbus has told suppliers it is planning for record production of its bestselling planes within two years in a sign of the manufacturer’s hopes for a belated but strong recovery for aviation from the coronavirus pandemic. The European manufacturer said on Thursday it would increase production of A320 single-aisle aircraft to 45 per month by October, up from 40. However, it said suppliers should be ready for a rate of 64 per month by the spring of 2023 for the A320, which is well suited to short-haul travel that is expected to bounce back the quickest. That would beat its previous highest rate target of 63, and would be followed by 70 per month at the start of 2024 and as high as 75 by 2025. The aerospace industry has endured months of weak demand for planes during the pandemic as airline customers cut back on orders as their revenues dried up. Airbus and its US rival, Boeing, together cut tens of thousands of jobs worldwide as demand plummeted. Demand for Boeing planes was hit further by the crisis over its previously top-selling 737 Max, which was grounded for over a year after two fatal crashes caused by malfunctions. There is still confusion over when people across the world will be allowed to travel for tourism purposes. Airline and holiday firm bosses on Wednesday attacked the UK government’s “utterly confusing” advice on foreign travel. However, aerospace analysts have long expected demand for air travel – alongside the sector’s carbon emissions – to overtake pre-pandemic levels rapidly once vaccines start to diminish the risks of the coronavirus. In the long term, the growth of the middle class in Asia and Africa is expected to continue the structural growth in flight number. Here’s the full story: Here’s more reaction to Airbus’s plan to boost aircraft production, particularly for its A320 jet. The BBC points out that Airbus’s plans could benefit Northern Ireland: Airbus has said it envisages producing 14 of its A220 airliners every month within the next five years. The wings for the A220 are made at the Spirit AeroSystems plant in Belfast. The current monthly production rate is five, which Airbus has said will increase to six early next year. Boris Johnson has been warned by business leaders that a fresh package of economic support would be required if rising Covid-19 infections prevent the further relaxation of pandemic restrictions next month, my colleague Richard Partington explains. After the reopening of hospitality venues indoors across all four nations of the UK, the Guardian’s latest monthly assessment of economic developments suggests the country is on course for a short-term growth boom this summer. Retail sales have surged above pre-pandemic levels, while customers returning to restaurants, pubs and cafes have driven a sharp rise in consumer spending to begin repairing the damage from the worst recession in 300 years. However, concerns are mounting over the Covid variant first detected in India – B.1.617.2 – and the possibility that rising infections could delay the next phase of the government’s roadmap for relaxing controls in England. Here’s the full story: Here’s Reuters’s take on the jump in restaurant booking last week: British diners flocked to restaurants over the past week after lockdown restrictions lifted across most of the United Kingdom, and the number of furloughed workers fell to its lowest since the start of the year, weekly official data showed. The figures add to signs that economic life is returning to normal as lockdown restrictions ease following the roll-out of COVID vaccines which now cover more than 70% of the adult population. Britain’s government closed pubs, restaurants and non-essential retailers at the start of the year due to the spread of a more infectious variant of COVID, and significant reopening only started in late April. Restaurants in England, Scotland and Wales were allowed to serve customers indoors from May 17, after several weeks when outdoor dining was allowed. Bookings in the first full week of opening, ending May 24, were 32% above their level in the same period of 2019, before the pandemic, according to data from booking website OpenTable produced for the Office for National Statistics. This chart shows how UK online job adverts have now risen to 18% above their pre-pandemic level. It highlights how firms are look to hire more staff to handle rising demand - particularly in transport and logistics, and construction. But, as Adzuna point out, graduate job opportunities are lagging behind: The proportion of workers on furlough has fallen to its lowest level this year, as the UK economy emerges from lockdown. New figures from the ONS shows that 8% of the workforce were furloughed in the two weeks to May 16, the lowest total seen so far in 2021. That equates to around 2.2m, and is down from 10% around the start of the month. The report also shows a surge in people returning to restaurants since indoor dining was allowed again last week. Restaurant bookings in the week to Monday May 24th were 32% higher than their level two years earlier, as people took the opportunity to eat out indoors again. Firms are also posting more online job adverts - a sign that the economy is picking up as restrictions are relaxed. Online job adverts on 21 May 2021 were 18% higher than the average in February 2020 - an increase of 4 percentage points on last week, according to data from Adzuna. The largest weekly increase was for “transport, logistics and warehouse” jobs, which surged 21 percentage points to 275% of its February 2020 average level -- the highest level since the series began in February 2018. Manufacturers also posted more job adverts - up 14 percentage points week-on-week, to 231% of its February 2020 average level. But “catering and hospitality” saw a small dip, down 2 percentage points on last week, to around 113% of its February 2020 average. The ONS adds: This follows a recent upward trend for this category, having risen by 55 percentage points since 9 April 2021, just before the first easing of hospitality restrictions when pubs and restaurants reopened in England. Top US and Chinese trade negotiators held “candid” talks today, their first under the Biden presidency, as Washington continues to raise concerns over Beijing’s trade practices. In the long-awaited first official engagement between the US trade representative Katherine Tai and the Chinese vice-premier, Liu He, held virtually on Thursday morning Beijing time, the two sides emphasised the importance of the bilateral trade relations and agreed to further negotiations. A statement from China’s commerce ministry said the US and China held “candid, pragmatic and constructive exchanges with an attitude of equality and mutual respect”. In Washington, the office of the US trade representative said that Tai “discussed the guiding principles of the Biden-Harris administration’s worker-centred trade policy and her ongoing review of the US-China trade relationship, while also raising issues of concern.” Here’s the full story: The pandemic has hit profits at the publisher of the Daily Mail, although its investment in online car retailer Cazoo is more than cushioning the blow. Pre-tax profits at Daily Mail and General Trust fell 45% in the six months to the end of March to £42m, down from £77m a year earlier. Revenues dropped to £547m, from £642m. While its business-to-business information service grew revenues and profits, its events and exhibitions arm suffered a 95% drop in revenues amid the lockdown. The consumer media businesses (which includes the Daily Mail, Mailonline, Metro and the ‘i’) saw revenues drop 10% amid a volatile advertising market. DMGT’s 20% stake in used car seller Cazoo - which is floating in New York - is valued at $1.35bn, or around £957m. That means an eight-fold return on DMGT’s total investment of £117m, after it invested another £34m in Cazoo last October. CEO Paul Zwillenberg said: Our financial flexibility enabled us to continue to invest in Cazoo through multiple funding rounds. Despite the near-term economic uncertainty, we had conviction in its opportunity to transform the used car market. Cazoo continues to go from strength to strength and its proposed SPAC combination on the New York Stock Exchange would value our stake at US$1.35bn, a return of eight times on our capital. Shares in DMGT are up 3.3% this morning. Rolls-Royce, the jet engine maker, is leading the FTSE 100 risers this morning - up 3% - as Airbus’s announcement lifts the sector. Warren East, Rolls-Royce’s CEO, told Radio 4’s Today Programme that predicting the precise timing of the recovery was very difficult. East also points out that Covid-19 will have a permanent impact on the sector: The pandemic will undoubtedly change certain behaviours, and that’s reflected in our expectation of a smaller market in future than we would have expected pre-Covid. But we absolutely expect continued growth, because aviation is such an important part of the world economy. East was speaking as Rolls-Royce opened its new £90m engine testbed at its Derby factory. The largest in the world (bigger than a football pitch, apparently), it will test new engines before they’re put into service. While the pandemic has hit air travel, it has also created a boom in pet ownership. UK retailer Pets at Home has achieved sales of more than £1bn for the first time, as more people have turned to furry, feathered and scaled friends in the lockdown. My colleague Jasper Jolly explains: The retailer and vet chain estimated that pet numbers increased by 8% during a year in which many people were stuck at home. The boom has led to pet food shortages. The pandemic “structurally altered the dynamics of the UK pet care market”, the company said, with increased home working removing a barrier to pet ownership and increasing the emotional attachment to – and willingness to spend on – animals. Pets at Home revenues grew by 7.9% to £1.1bn in the year to 25 March, which coincided almost exactly with the start of the UK’s lockdowns. That was a record in the company’s 30-year history. It said there had been a pet “baby boom”. Sales of kitten and puppy products surged by 37% and 26% respectively, with training products and heated puppy beds in particular demand. Even less cuddly fish tank sales increased. The global rollout of Covid-19 vaccines is lifting future demand for travel, as economies reopen and tourism picks up. So aircraft bosses need to take decisions now if they want suppliers to be ready for higher output in future. The FT’s Sylvia Pfeifer explains: The outlook for a longer-term recovery in aviation has improved with the global rollout of vaccines despite regional flare-ups. One of the biggest challenges for the industry is ensuring that its long, intricate supply chains are ready to ramp up production to meet the expected demand. Reuters says Airbus has laid out ‘sweeping goals’ to expand production of its A320 jetliners over the next few years (initially from 40 per month today to 45 by the end of the year, and 64 per month by Q2 2023). Demand for single-aisle jets is recovering as domestic travel rebounds, especially in the United States and China. In anticipation of a continued recovery in that market, Airbus is asking its suppliers to “enable a scenario” where it can produce 70 single-aisle jets a month by the first quarter of 2024. “Longer term, Airbus is investigating opportunities for rates as high as 75 (a month) by 2025,” it said. Analysts at Jefferies described the move by Boeing’s main rival as “punchy production plans”. Airbus is telling suppliers to prepare for an ‘aggressive ramp up’ of jet production, explains Richard Schuurman, aviation reporter for Air Insight. Airbus has boosted optimism for a global aviation recovery by alerting its suppliers prepare for a sharp increase in A320 production, says Bloomberg: Airbus SE is preparing to gear up production of its best-selling A320-series jets beyond pre-pandemic levels within two years, lending a jolt of optimism for a recovery in global aviation. The shares jumped after the world’s largest producer of commercial jetliners told suppliers to be ready to raise output of its top-selling narrow-body to a rate of 64 per month by the second quarter of 2023. That figure could rise to 70 a month early the following year and could reach 75 by 2025, Airbus said in a statement Thursday. The ambitious plan stands out in an industry that’s still struggling to gain traction after the Covid-19 pandemic wiped out demand for air travel. Despite short-term flareups in the outbreak, the longer-term picture has brightened with the global rollout of vaccines. Airbus and its U.S. rival Boeing Co. have been showing more confidence even as pressure to lower emissions presents the next challenge for the industry. Shares in Airbus have jumped around 6% in early trading in Paris, as investors welcome its plans to boost production output over the next few years. They’re currently up €5.7 at €103.4, close to April’s one-year high. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After seeing demand battered by the pandemic, aerospace manufacturer Airbus says the recovery is beginning. It’s alerted its suppliers to prepare for a steep acceleration in production of its popular A320 single-aisle passenger jets, as it sets target above pre-pandemic levels in two years time. The European aerospace group has confirmed plans to increase A320 output to 45 jets per month in the last quarter of this year, from 40 at present. It has also set suppliers a new target -- 64 a month by the second quarter of 2023, and wants to ensure it has the long term capacity in place. That’s above the 60/month peak it hit in 2019, before Covid-19. Airbus says it expect the commercial aircraft market to recover to pre-COVID levels between 2023 and 2025, led by the single-aisle segment. Guillaume Faury, Airbus CEO, says this morning: “The aviation sector is beginning to recover from the COVID-19 crisis” Looking further ahead, Airbus is anticipating a “continued recovering market”. It also asking suppliers to “ enable a scenario” for production to expand further to 70 by the first quarter of 2024. And long term, it’s also investigating whether it could boost production to 75 by 2025. This steep ramp up looks like a sign of confidence in the recovery of the aviation industry from the pandemic - with Covid-19 vaccinations enabling a pick-up in international tourism. Faury says Airbus wants its suppliers to be ready for the pick-up in demand. “The message to our supplier community provides visibility to the entire industrial ecosystem to secure the necessary capabilities and be ready when market conditions call for it. In parallel, we are transforming our industrial system by optimising our aerostructures set-up and modernising our A320 Family production facilities. All these actions are set in motion to prepare our future.” Airbus is also slightly increasing its production goals for its small A220 jet, and the wide-body A350 - again, in a mix of provisional goals and firm plans. A220 Family: Currently at around rate five aircraft per month from Mirabel and Mobile, the rate is confirmed to rise to around six in early 2022. Airbus is also envisaging a monthly production rate of 14 by the middle of the decade. A350 Family: Currently at an average production rate of five per month, this is expected to increase to six by autumn 2022. A330 Family: Production remains at an average monthly production rate of two per month. Also coming up today Big Oil is reeling from a series of blows yesterday, over their failure to move faster to tackle the climate emergency. US oil giants ExxonMobil and Chevron both suffered shareholder rebellions, with 61% of Chevron shareholders supporting a resolution to set targets to reduce all of its emissions. Activist hedge fund Engine No. 1 got two directors elected to the board of ExxonMobil. And in a landmark case in the Hague, a Dutch court ruled that Royal Dutch Shell must reduce its global carbon emissions by 45% by the end of 2030. Dan Gocher, Director of Climate &amp; Environment at the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR) says these developments have “massive implications”. “This news is nothing short of extraordinary, and it will have massive implications for the Australian oil and gas industry. “Chevron, ExxonMobil and Shell are three of Australia’s largest oil and gas producers, and therefore three of our largest carbon polluters. “All three companies will now be under enormous pressure from both shareholders and the wider public to cut emissions, and cut them fast. European markets are rather subdued, after a lacklustre day’s trading in Asia which saw Japan’s Nikkei drop 0.3% and the Hong Kong Hang Seng dip 0.2%. Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst for Asia Pacific at OANDA, says: Some of the week’s froth has come out of the markets in Asia today, with equities edging lower, along with energy and precious metals and our good friends, the cryptocurrency space, while the US Dollar edged higher after an impressive rally overnight.

Ali Issa Ahmad, 28, a Sudanese-born British citizen, went on holiday to UAE in January 2019 to attend the AFC Asian Cup, which was hosted by UAE between 5 January and 1 February 2019. He says that while he was there he was falsely imprisoned and suffered assault and battery, intentional infliction of harm including psychiatric harm and negligence while he was detained in Sharjah, UAE, between 23 January and 12 February 2019. On Thursday, Ahmad sent letters of claim for damages against the six officials, including counsellor Saqr Saif Al Naqbi, head of state security public prosecution in Abu Dhabi, Maj Gen Faris Khalaf Al Mazrouei, commander in chief of the Abu Dhabi police, and Maj Gen Ahmed Naser Ahmed Al Dahri, second in command of the Abu Dhabi state security department. Ahmad’s problems started when he wore a football shirt bearing the Qatari logo when he attended a match at Al-Nayhan stadium in Abu Dhabi between Qatar and Iraq on 22 January 2019. He was approached by officials and said he received racist abuse from them and was ordered to remove the Qatari shirt. The following day he was stopped again by officials and says he was seriously assaulted before being detained and imprisoned. At the time the UAE authorities put out a statement saying that he had inflicted the injuries on himself, and accused him of wasting police time. Ahmad is being represented by Carter-Ruck solicitors in his legal action. He said: “I have been waiting for too long for justice for what happened to me. I was very badly tortured and nearly killed in prison in the UAE. They tried to make it look as though I did these things to myself, that I cut and burned myself. It is so cruel that they did this. “The UAE authorities have ignored all my complaints and there has been no investigation and no one held accountable. I have decided to launch a civil case against those who are responsible for torturing me so that the truth can come out and there can finally be justice for the terrible things that were done to me.” The then Foreign and Commonwealth Office lodged a complaint with the UAE authorities about Ahmad’s treatment but it is understood no response was received. The UAE embassy has been approached for comment.","charCount":"2425","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/dianetaylor\">Diane Taylor</a>"},{"headline":"Victoria enters seven-day Covid lockdown with masks mandatory, schools closed and travel banned","standfirst":"<p>Officials say a week-long lockdown is needed because the coronavirus variant is spreading faster than contact tracers can keep up with</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/may/27/covid-restrictions-victoria-new-greater-melbourne-and-vic-coronavirus-rules-explained\">Victoria’s Covid lockdown restrictions: new rules explained</a><br></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/may/27/covid-19-melbourne-exposure-sites-hotspots-list-victoria-metro-regional-vic-coronavirus-cases-outbreak-locations\">Victoria Covid-19 hotspots and exposure sites</a></li></ul>","trailText":"Officials say a seven-day lockdown is needed because the coronavirus variant is spreading faster than contact tracers can keep up with","byline":"Melissa Davey and Lisa Cox","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d02f50d1071321bc1ba21da3369210c1a645b4d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d02f50d1071321bc1ba21da3369210c1a645b4d0/691_660_4133_2480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Acting Victorian premier James Merlino says a seven-day lockdown is needed to stop the spread of Covid after 11 new cases linked to the Melbourne cluster were recorded.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Acting Victorian premier James Merlino says a seven-day lockdown is needed to stop the spread of Covid after 11 new cases linked to the Melbourne cluster were recorded.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Ross/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Victoria is entering a seven-day lockdown as authorities work to contain a rapidly spreading Covid outbreak that the acting premier has warned is “running faster than we have ever recorded”.</p> <p>The government hopes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/may/27/covid-restrictions-victoria-new-greater-melbourne-and-vic-coronavirus-rules-explained\">the restrictions</a> – which start at midnight and include compulsory masks, school closures and a 5km travel limit for shopping and exercise – will act as a circuit-breaker after the state reported 11 new cases of the B1617.1 variant on Thursday taking the cluster to 26.</p> <p>Two more states – Western Australia and Tasmania – introduced hard border closures while Queensland said it would require people arriving from Victoria to go into hotel quarantine.</p> <p>NSW has kept its border open but is asking anyone arriving from Victoria to follow the stay-at-home measures for the seven-day lockdown period.</p> <p>Victoria’s acting premier, James Merlino, said contact tracers were in danger of being overwhelmed by the Covid-19 outbreak.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/may/27/afl-scrambles-again-as-melbourne-lockdown-causes-chaos-for-sport\">AFL scrambles again as Melbourne lockdown causes chaos for sport</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Merlino said on Thursday contact tracers were struggling to keep up despite quickly identifying more than 10,000 primary and secondary contacts and <a href=\"https://www.coronavirus.vic.gov.au/exposure-sites\">150 potential exposure sites</a>.</p> <p>“The usual transmission is about five to six days [but] in some of these cases, within a day it’s being transmitted,” Merlino said. “The number of cases has doubled in 24 hours.

The government hopes the restrictions – which start at midnight and include compulsory masks, school closures and a 5km travel limit for shopping and exercise – will act as a circuit-breaker after the state reported 11 new cases of the B1617.1 variant on Thursday taking the cluster to 26. Two more states – Western Australia and Tasmania – introduced hard border closures while Queensland said it would require people arriving from Victoria to go into hotel quarantine. NSW has kept its border open but is asking anyone arriving from Victoria to follow the stay-at-home measures for the seven-day lockdown period. Victoria’s acting premier, James Merlino, said contact tracers were in danger of being overwhelmed by the Covid-19 outbreak. Merlino said on Thursday contact tracers were struggling to keep up despite quickly identifying more than 10,000 primary and secondary contacts and 150 potential exposure sites. “The usual transmission is about five to six days [but] in some of these cases, within a day it’s being transmitted,” Merlino said. “The number of cases has doubled in 24 hours.

As of 11.59pm Thursday, the five reasons for Victorians to leave home include shopping for necessary goods and services; authorised work or permitted education; exercise; caregiving; and medical reasons, including to get vaccinated. Half of Victorians are now eligible to be vaccinated, as Merlino also announced those aged 40 and above can book in for the Pfizer vaccine. “The vaccine rollout has been slower than we have hoped,” Merlino said. He added a lack of suitable quarantine facilities and a reluctance from some people to get vaccinated had been frustrating. Since the current outbreak in Victoria, however, record numbers of people have been vaccinated. On Thursday morning, the vaccine booking website crashed and the hotline was busy. Asked if Victorians should feel angry at the federal government given the slow pace of the rollout and lack of suitable purpose-built quarantine, Merlino responded: “It is a fact that the commonwealth vaccine rollout has been delayed and there are global reasons for that delay.” “We have also seen a reluctance from some people to get vaccinated when they are eligible,” he said. “It is a fact that we have aged care facilities where not one person has been vaccinated.

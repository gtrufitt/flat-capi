We have some very serious times that we’re dealing with, not just from the health point of view but obviously from a regional security point of view and Australia and New Zealand take a very prominent role in the Pacific, and I thank you for the relationship we’ve had working on particularly those issues in the Pacific.</p> <p> It is true that Australia and New Zealand has done very well in the course of Covid. But as you can see in Victoria now, those challenges persist. And equally in Fiji, they are dealing with the challenges, and Papua New Guinea, they are dealing with challenges. We’re supporting all of our Pacific family through our vaccine dose delivery into those regions and supporting them in their vaccinations.</p> <p> But the broader issue of the Indo-Pacific and a free and open Indo-Pacific is something Australia and New Zealand feels very strongly about. And working with our like-minded partners all around the world, the United States and the United Kingdom, and as we’re discussing across Europe, Japan and India, all of us have a big stake in ensuring a world that favours freedom and a free and open Indo-Pacific. And so we greatly appreciate the partnership we have to achieve those outcomes.</p> <p> So with those issues all on the table today, we should, we should move on and get on with it. I really appreciate the direct personal relationship and dialogue we’ve had and, and that will only continue because we have common challenges, there are common threats, and that has always I think eclipsed everything when it comes to the strength of the working family relationship.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"31491fbfd2663eb7c8525686f3d2003381a73307\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31491fbfd2663eb7c8525686f3d2003381a73307/0_0_4111_2741/1000.jpg\" alt=\"New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern (L) poses for a photo with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison ahead of their annual talks on Monday, May 31, 2021 in Queenstown, New Zealand.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern (L) poses for a photo with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison ahead of their annual talks on Monday, May 31, 2021 in Queenstown, New Zealand.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Allison/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-05-31T01:23:35.983Z\">at 2.23am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-60b4366a8f088d8c3178e13f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-05-31T01:06:01.284Z\">2.06am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>NSW Health has also updated its vaccination numbers</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NSWHealth/status/1399168940278829058\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The total number of vaccines administered in NSW is now 1,287,975 with 418,996 doses administered by NSW Health to 8pm last night and 868,979 administered by  the GP network and other providers, to 11:59pm on Friday 28 May 2021.</p>&mdash; NSW Health (@NSWHealth) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NSWHealth/status/1399168940278829058?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 31, 2021</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60b435738f088d8c3178e136\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-05-31T01:02:09.106Z\">2.02am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">NSW records no local Covid cases</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>NSW has recorded no locally acquired cases in the last 24 hours.</p> <p>Two people in hotel quarantine have tested positive for the virus.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-05-31T01:05:37.780Z\">at 2.05am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-60b433ab8f08d486a7717fa0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/melissa-davey\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-05-31T00:59:31.415Z\">1.59am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/may/28/overcrowding-in-victorian-hospitals-bigger-emergency-than-covid-expert-warns\">I wrote about how overcrowding in Victoria’s healthcare system is a “bigger public health emergency than Covid”</a>, according to a leading emergency physician who says the state’s doctors and nurses were exhausted even before the latest outbreak.<br><br>The Australasian College for Emergency Medicine Victoria faculty chair, <strong>Dr Mya Cubitt, </strong>said on Friday that doctors and nurses in public hospitals had been dreading such a situation because they were still recovering from Victoria’s second wave in 2020.

(Always better to check these things before saying them on national television.)</p> <p><strong>Josh Frydenberg </strong>hasn’t said there will be no assistance – just none right now. This was his response on Facebook yesterday, following criticism from the Victorian government about the Morrison government going MIA:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Since the end of jobkeeper Victoria is the third state to introduce a short lockdown. Greater Brisbane was subject to stay-at-home orders from 29 March to 1 April, the Perth metropolitan and Peel region was under stay-at-home orders from 24 to 27 April and Victoria is currently under stay-at-home orders from 28 May to 3 June.</p> <p>In both the Queensland and Western Australian lockdowns further federal support was not required. In the case of Victoria, the Morrison government has provided and continues to provide an unprecedented level of direct economic support. Over $45bn has already flowed to Victorian families and businesses during Covid, with more direct federal economic support per capita going to Victoria than to any other state. </p> <p>The amount of federal government direct economic support delivered to Victoria is around three times what has been delivered by the state government. The federal government continues to provide support to Victorian families and businesses through this pandemic. </p> <p>The pandemic leave disaster payment of $1,500 is available as is the national health emergency crisis payment. For businesses that experience losses, the loss carry-back measure is available to boost cash flow at the end of the financial year. </p> <p>The economic impact of the Victorian outbreak is not insignificant but the budget just over two weeks ago did anticipate further outbreaks would occur. Our budget measures were calibrated accordingly, with the budget providing an additional $41bn of Covid-related economic support. Should extended lockdowns be avoided and outbreaks contained the national economy can continue its strong recovery.</p> <p>The Morrison government will continue to work with the Victorian government<strong> and closely monitor the situation.</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>I’m not sure what good it is telling people they received a higher share of financial help previously is, when they need help now. And it is possible other Australian jurisdictions will be in the same spot. The last sentence is the interesting one there – “closely monitor the situation” is usually code for, “if this gets worse, we’ll have to do something”. Which is cold comfort for people who have seen all their shifts disappear, with no warning, just as they were starting to get back on their feet.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-05-30T23:08:32.642Z\">at 12.08am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-60b416078f088d8c3178e037\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-05-30T22:47:56.487Z\">11.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There are now <a href=\"https://www.coronavirus.vic.gov.au/exposure-site\">268 exposure sites on the Victorian Health website</a></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60b413048f086d71cc15f876\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-05-30T22:42:03.166Z\">11.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Former Labor MP <strong>Emma Husar, </strong>who was forced to resign from the federal parliament after “slut-shaming” allegations were reported against her (an investigation into the allegations later found no basis for the salacious claims against her and Husar subsequently won a defamation action against Buzzfeed) wants an apology from <strong>Anthony Albanese</strong> (as leader) and damages from the Labor party.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/emma_husar/status/1398892095687979012\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Who would have thought women needed protection from their own party? <br>Sexual harassment isn’t new, women in Canberra deserve better, the ALP needs to take responsibility for their conduct in this, own their failings &amp; BE sorry <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/auspol?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#auspol</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/hFbDgkQS9e\">https://t.co/hFbDgkQS9e</a></p>&mdash; Emma Husar (@emma_husar) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/emma_husar/status/1398892095687979012?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 30, 2021</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p><strong>Bill Shorten</strong> was leader at the time, and is asked whether Husar deserves an apology from the Labor party:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I do think that Emma – she was on the receiving end of some poor treatment, too. </p> <p>So I have spoken to her in the past.

Daniel Andrews won’t be returning to work tomorrow (June 1) but still hopes to be back at some point in June. Here is Martin Foley when asked again why Victoria can’t stop private aged care workers from working at multiple facilities. Private aged care is a federal government responsibility. Foley: I think you’re inviting me to do two things. One is to be critical of the commonwealth, which I’m not going to do. I’m going to work cooperatively with the commonwealth to address a real problem. And you’re inviting me to, on the run, reframe the regulatory framework that’s applied for Covid responses right across the commonwealth in private residential aged care for some 14 months. Clearly the Victorian government, and all the state governments and territory government’s powers when it comes to pandemic responses are broad and significant. But they also try to be as consistent as possible and in line with the national direction set by national cabinet. In this regard, without doubt, the chief health officer’s powers are very broad. But they also need to be appropriately reflected against the national consistent policies wherever that applies. That is in the case of private residential aged care. Jacinda Ardern was asked about the Christchurch terrorist, and whether there are any discussions about him serving out the rest of his life sentence in Australia. She said that “future decisions” on the issue need “to come from the guidance of the community”. We haven’t undergone any formal consultation on future imprisonment and where he should see out the end of his days in prison. But certainly some of the informal feedback has been [that] he should stay in New Zealand.” That was out of a desire for assurance that the sentence be served, Ardern said. Scott Morrison said it was a “deeply sensitive” issue and Australia shared that view. Australia was “open to those dialogues” but “at this point that is not the plan”, he said. The first question at the Scott Morrison and Jacinda Ardern press conference is to the Australian prime minister, asking about earlier comments that Australia is unwilling to sell its sovereignty. Does he think New Zealand has sold its sovereignty to China? Morrison replies “no” - and says that although Australia and New Zealand are trading nations “neither of us will trade our sovereignty or trade away our values”. So we’ve avoided a diplomatic incident there. In answer to a later question, Ardern said she doesn’t detect any difference between Australia and New Zealand on questions of human rights in China. Morrison then agrees. Ardern says New Zealand’s membership of the Five Eyes network is “not in question and not in doubt”. She rejects the suggestion New Zealand is “cosying up” to China. Asked about the travel bubble, Ardern takes a cautious approach: Both of us share enthusiasm, where it is safe to do so, to expand the trans-Tasman bubble. We want to maintain the freedoms we have, which means maintaining the very high bar we’ve set. Given vaccination is not yet widespread we would need to satisfy ourselves there was no risk Covid could enter. There are some Pacific countries where that would be an option - our Pacific neighbours.” Morrison is taken to a specific example of a deportation from Australia to New Zealand - a highly controversial issue in the alliance. He reiterates that Australia’s laws allow it to cancel the visa of anyone convicted of a criminal offence. Ardern does not repeat her most strident criticism of the policy but said she reiterates New Zealand’s views on citizenship and deportation. Morrison is “very clear on New Zealand’s view”, she said. This is something to pay attention to: We’ll leave the Victorian press conference there for a moment and check in with some of the other news that happened in that hour and a bit. I asked the office of the federal aged care services minister Richard Colbeck whether the guidelines that aged care staff should, where possible, only work at one main facility had been relaxed or changed at all before the most recent outbreak. Colbeck did not answer the question, but said single-site funding support for Covid-19 impacted areas of Victoria was triggered for providers across Greater Melbourne on Thursday, 27 May. He said: “This will support residential aged care providers to implement single-site workforce arrangements. The grant funding will be available for out-of-pocket costs incurred during an initial two-week period, from 27 May 2021 to 10 June 2021. If the hotspot declaration is extended, these arrangements will also be extended. Providers are asked to adjust their rosters and ensure staff are only working at one residential aged care facility during this time. A reminder that employers should ensure their workers are not financially disadvantaged during this period and that they continue to receive the income they may have received from other residential aged care providers. Where this results in additional out-of-pocket costs for the primary employer, reimbursement can be sought through the grant application process.” Guardian Australia understands the federal government can’t actually restrict casual staff from supplementing their income by working across sites, despite their guidelines. They can only do so during outbreaks when this funding support is triggered. Ahhh, the art of the subtle burn: Q: Has the COVIDSafe app (the federal government app that was meant to be like ‘‘sunscreen’’) been used at all during the outbreak? Has it identified any areas? Martin Foley: No. Not to my knowledge and I’m sure in such a rare event it would have been brought to my attention. Who has been vaccinated when it comes to Victoria’s frontline workers? Jeroen Weimar So hotel quarantine workers is 100% - there’s a requirement and it’s part of their conditions of service within the system. Within the wider health service, we had critical healthcare workers who were part of the original rollout, going back to February. All of them have been delivered. And recognising people come into roles and move out of roles, wider healthcare service I can give you numbers but over 85% of wider healthcare workers, hundreds of thousands of people across the state have been vaccinated, and [that] includes our public sector residential aged care workforce. Just to highlight that, we started our public sector residential aged care vaccination program back in February. We completed the first round on April 19. We continue to update it as we go through our second-dose cycle. Part of the reason for this lockdown - and the concern - is that this variant of the virus, B.1.617, is more virulent than previous strains. It’s been one of the reasons there are so many primary and secondary contacts, and so many exposure sites. How long can Victorian businesses go without a wage subsidy or some help? James Merlino: Well, this is a devastating time for businesses. And we absolutely acknowledge that. That’s why we delivered a bigger and broader business support package than we delivered in February. And we’ll deliver it as quickly as we can. Businesses are able to provide an expression of interest in terms of it. There will be applications open no later than Wednesday of this week. And businesses, the first payments will start by the end of this week. So we know how tough businesses are doing and that’s why we have provided a quarter of a billion dollars of support. And we feel that the federal government should also support Victorian businesses. Does James Merlino believe the federal government is not providing financial support because it is does not want to encourage “heavy handed lockdowns’’? Merlino: That’s entirely speculative. You’d have to put those questions to the federal treasurer. The treasurer and myself outlined Victoria’s position very, very clearly yesterday. And I’ve got nothing to add to those comments. If the lockdown was smaller, does Merlino believe there would have been support? That’s a question you should put to the federal government. I don’t know their thinking in refusing to provide the support that we’re asking for, that businesses across the state are asking for. That’s a question you’d need to put to the federal government. What does Victoria want from the federal government? We put it to them that there needs to be support for Victorian businesses, wage subsidy is a responsibility of the federal government. We’re in a circuit-breaker lockdown. Businesses are doing it tough. We don’t have JobKeeper. So it was appropriate, we thought, we’re putting a quarter of a billion dollars, bigger and broader than the circuit-breaker lockdown’s business support back in February. We think it’s appropriate that the federal government provide support as well. In terms of why and in terms of their thinking, those are questions you would need to put to them. James Merlino is asked why Victoria is going through this again - why is Victoria “the capital for outbreaks and lockdowns’’? Merlino: Well, I think that is an unfair question. What we have seen right across the nation are breaches in hotel quarantine. Let’s remember that this outbreak that we are dealing with right now originated from a hotel quarantine breach in South Australia. That’s a fact. All the genomic testing points to the outbreak in hotel quarantine in South Australia. Now, I’ve said we would not be in this position, we would be in a very different world, if we had a successful rollout of the commonwealth’s vaccination program. It would be a very different world if we had alongside hotel quarantine alternative quarantine arrangements for our highest-risk cohorts that travel in from overseas. But we don’t have that. What we have had is a breach after 86 days, after 86 days without community transmission in Victoria, we had a breach in South Australia that has led to this outbreak that we are dealing with right now ... I understand the question but every outbreak is different. Everyone who is positive with COVID-19, many do not transmit. Some transmit and are highly infectious. That is the nature of this global pandemic. We’ve had an outbreak from South Australia, [it] travelled to Victoria, and now we are dealing with this outbreak. What people want to see are the actions we are taking to get in front of this outbreak as quickly as we can. What has the lockdown achieved so far? James Merlino: I just want to be honest with people. Every step of the way we are talking to the broader Victorian community about where we are right now. And where we are today is those additional cases that we’ve gone through, a high number of primary close contacts, a high number of exposure sites, very concerning number of very high-risk settings. I want to be clear with people: the next few days are going to be so critically important and that includes the possibility that this outbreak will get worse before it gets better. That’s the situation that we’re in right now and I want to be upfront with people to let them know that’s the case. Have the lessons from last year, in terms of aged care, been learned? Martin Foley: We’re learning more about this virus and how it acts every day and in different settings every day. What we are also learning about is how people respond to that virus every day, in different settings, in different ways. And we’re also learning that the best way in which we can respond to that in a particularly Australian context is to secure our borders through dedicated specific high-risk quarantine facilities being built separate to hotel quarantine. And to avoid the kind of leakage that we’ve seen from the South Australian hotel quarantine breach that is at the heart of this outbreak. And on the other hand we’ve also seen ... how we respond through matching high-risk settings, getting vaccinated, getting tested. It’s up to all of us - doesn’t matter public, private, what the setting is - we all have a shared sense of responsibility to do the right thing here and overcome this breach and overcome this particular high-risk setting in our private residential aged care sector. Can Victoria regulate the private aged care sector? Martin Foley: We just had a royal commission into our aged care sector. It is beyond dispute this sector is regulated, funded and overwhelmingly guided by the commonwealth. In the course of a global pandemic, through the cooperative Victorian Aged Care Response Centre framework, where we all get together with a shared purpose of beating this virus, we share our issues in a cooperative approach in that regard. So I don’t think it’s right to say that this is a sector that is unregulated. It’s where the regulatory power lies. James Merlino says it is “too early to speculate” whether or not the lockdown will be lifted at the end of the seven days. So if you are planning to get married this weekend, or have any other plans (or are a parent of a school-aged child), I am sorry, we can’t give you any concrete answer as to what will happen at the end of the week. Martin Foley is asked whether Covid is back in Victoria’s aged care system and says: Covid-19 cases are back in our residential private aged care system and that is not a good thing, it is a very serious thing that Professor Sutton has indicated, these are a high-risk setting. I don’t have to remind people in Victoria and Australia, the disproportionate impact Covid-19 has on fatalities and private potential, in residential aged care settings. That is why we have prioritised these people in the 1A and IB groups, these high-risk settings. Governments have been very keen on [making] sure we work hand in glove with the commonwealth to deliver support for our sectors, and their sectors, and increasingly, [the] responsibility of getting it done regardless of what sector you are in. Is he frustrated with the federal government, given what happened last year in Victoria’s aged care homes? Foley: You are inviting me to be critical of the commonwealth government in the space. I’m the minister for health, I know how the virus reacts and it does [not] make a distinction between commonwealth and state facilities. My job is to keep Victorians safe, especially in those high-risk settings. There are multiple challenges to that every day, as we see. Public health team responses have been for the past week extraordinary, for the past year. We are keeping up with this, I want to thank everyone involved, I will resist the temptation to be critical of the commonwealth, I will work cooperatively with them every chance I get to get ahead of us. Martin Foley on that topic: Let’s be clear, this is not a particularly unique Victorian set of circumstances, this is a national system that applies across all of the commonwealth. People may recall in the early outbreak back in NSW and Sydney, some of the issues that our NSW friends ran into – common private residential aged care, some of those settings. The challenges they have in responding to that framework. The Victorian public residential aged care system attached to our healthcare network, that is what the tricky government regulates under arrangements. ...We all bring our separate roles and responsibilities to this national pandemic, this global pandemic. When it comes to residential aged care, for the last time, this pandemic has been raging across the country. Public residential aged care is the responsibility of the states. Private residential aged care is the responsibility of the commonwealth. It doesn’t really matter, to the families and communities and the workforce, which is why we have established the Victorian Aged Care Response Centre model so as to co-ordinate that effort. As part that coordination of effort we have continually shared issues and priorities with our friends from the commonwealth and I thank them for their partnership. As part of that partnership, we are now seeing the commonwealth bring forward vaccination programs in some of these private residential aged care centres for staff and workforce. We welcome that. Why did the Victorian government not stop the federal government from allowing aged care workers to move to different centres in private facilities? James Merlino: The answer is, public aged care is the responsibility of state government. Private aged care is the responsibility of the federal government. Can the state step in to stop it? I might ask the minister for health to add to the comments I have made, it’s a very simple proposition. Public sector aged care, state responsibility – we have clear policies in place that has made sure workers don’t work across sites. Private sector aged care is a federal government responsibility. These are absolutely relevant questions everyone is asking – they should be put to the federal government. Acting premier James Merlino is asked about workers in private aged care centres (for which the federal government has oversight) and why they are still able to work across multiple sites, when in the state facilities that is not happening. Merlino: In terms of aged care, the minister for health might supplement my answer. In terms of our workforce, through our policy settings and the financial support for the public sector, we have been able to have 100% of aged care workers in metropolitan Melbourne who are not working across multiple sites. And that’s for a reason. These are high-risk venues. In terms of the settings the federal government do not have, in fact up until I think as recently as last Friday, it was the ability for workers and federal aged care, private sector aged care, to work across sites. That’s a question [for the federal government]. Will the city be separated from regional Victoria again? Brett Sutton: It will be determined as we go through a review of the situation day-by-day. It is not out of the question. Victorian authorities still have a missing link with their earlier cases, which they continue to look for. More on where private aged care staff can work: Victoria’s COVID-19 testing commander Jeroen Weimar has outlined the new exposure sites authorities are particularly concerned about, because they’re tier-one stores and markets. These include: JMDGrocers &amp; Sweets Indian supermarket in Epping Healthy India grocery in Reservoir Inday Filipino Asian Store in Footscray market Thai Huy Butcher in Footscray market You can find the times of concern and the full list of exposure sites here. Weimar said: These and of course a number of the other tier-one exposure sites we have out on our website are really important to us. “We really want to establish who’s been to these locations, capture as many people as possible and make sure we get them tested and isolated as swiftly as we can.” Jeroen Weimer says it is not just the number of cases, but the number of exposure sites - which are still increasing - which is a concern. These exposure sites are ... a major concern for us. The slightly discouraging picture over the last 24 hours in the new cases we have seen overnight is a much shorter period and one associated with the aged care worker. Because she got tested immediately [after her] symptoms onset on Friday, her primary close contacts were also very short into their infectious period. So it reduced the number of exposure sites and that gives us obviously a much better chance of getting a hold of this and putting it down. The more than 4000 people who have been identified as a close or secondary contact of a confirmed case and who are meant to be isolating are being monitored, Brett Sutton says. Six hundred doorknocks are planned for today, and the Australian Defence Force is helping with that. What factors are being considered, in terms of whether or not the lockdown needs to be extended? Brett Sutton: The real measure is not to have more cases but, if cases occur, to make sure that they are quarantining. We have seen increasingly the new cases we identify are already quarantining and that is a good sign. There will be people who – for essential work purposes, for caring compassionate reasons – are still moving about and so some new exposure sites will occur by virtue of that. We need to reflect on how many people are exposed in those settings and the sensitivity of those settings in terms of vulnerable people. Should the federal government have stopped workers in the private aged care sector from working across multiple facilities? (As Mel has pointed out, the guidelines say don’t do it, but they are not enforced. Aged care workers often need to work across multiple sites in order to make a living - another symptom of a casualised workforce, and paying essential workers such low rates.) Brett Sutton: It is a question for the commonwealth, it is a commonwealth workforce. As has been stated, the minister has said that in the public sector, the Victorian public sector, aged care, there has been both financial support and a policy setting that has effectively prohibited work across multiple aged care sites. That is entirely appropriate. It is massively risky to move across different settings ... It is a risk wherever it occurs, it doesn’t matter if it is public or private, but the question as to how it is effectively enforced, supported financially or otherwise in terms of policy, is a question for the commonwealth. Does Brett Sutton believe the state should take over the vaccination rollout for private aged care homes? Sutton: We will work with the commonwealth with whatever assistance they may desire of the states. The minister has made that clear. We are ready and willing to assist with whatever request might come through. The reality is we have been open to vaccinate private aged care workforce for the last three weeks. That continues to be available and if I could say anything to the aged care workforce, practically speaking, the greatest protection you can give to those under your charge, under your care, and I know you care for them, is to get vaccinated, to be fully vaccinated. That would be the greatest protection you could provide to those you are caring for, in whatever setting. And I know that not all of you have been vaccinated to date and there are multiple reasons for that but if it is a matter of tossing up whether or not the vaccine provides protection for you, and by virtue of that to those you care for, please come forward to get tested now. Brett Sutton speaks a little more on the prospect that the lockdown could be extended: We have to prepare for anything. We don’t know what will unfold over coming days. We have said that all the way through. We interrogate the data very deeply on a day-by-day basis. We could get very reassuring news over the rest of today but we have had staff come to us in the last 48 hours. It is very concerning and we need to bear that in mind. Victoria’s chief health officer, professor Brett Sutton, is also implying the seven-day “circuit breaker’’ lock down could be extended. Nothing is confirmed - but the comments so far are not promising. It’s a day-by-day prospect but, as the acting premier said, they are concerning numbers and concerning settings. We’ve gone from a single case at the beginning of the month to 4200 primary close contacts. It has been a rapidly moving virus and the transmission that has occurred in those high-risk settings has been very substantial. So we have to take it as a day-by-day prospect. With more numbers today coming through and those really concerning settings, especially in aged care, we are neck-and-neck with this virus and it is an absolute beast. Jeroen Weimer reminds people to make sure they are well before going out to get vaccinated. If you are feeling unwell, get tested and isolate until you receive your results. The person in charge of Victoria’s testing regime, Jeroen Weimar, is also at this press conference: Over the last seven days of this outbreak we have seen 275,000 Victorians come forward for testing. Over that same period we have delivered 95,600 vaccinations through our state clinics, making a total of 476,000 vaccinations delivered since the start of the vaccination program through our state clinics, part of the 1.1 million doses allocated to Victorians in the last few months. My thanks go to those working in the vaccination stations over a very busy seven-day cycle, the GPs across the state [are] a critical part of the vaccination effort. As the acting premier has said, over the last seven days we have identified 4200 primary close contacts. We continue to see an encouraging set of negative results come back, 77% of those identified have already returned a negative test result. With the huge numbers of tests going through the system, we see that number go up. We have now 279 exposure sites. Martin Foley: The fact this outbreak has crept into a number of private residential aged care facilities is obviously a very great concern to the Victorian government. It’s a very great concern to all Victorians and the commonwealth government. In Victoria, we are very grateful for the support that has been put in place, be that from the Victorian aged care response sector, a joint partnership between the state and the commonwealth; we are grateful for the western public health unit, that has taken the lead in a number of response measures; and we are grateful to the commonwealth and others working in partnership with us to respond to the outbreaks in private residential aged care. Since the start of the pandemic, in 2020, we have put in place additional rigourous measures, to protect our residential aged care facilities – our staff and, most importantly, the residents. While of course the commonwealth is responsible for the regulation of private residential aged care in Victoria, Victoria has sought to assist that sector wherever we possibly can. Including through the extensive on-ground support provided by our healthcare workers, who have now completed more than 5000 shifts, of the state system assisting those private residential aged care services, which are indeed on the ground as we speak. Health minister Martin Foley steps up: Unfortunately, three of today’s cases relate to emerging outbreaks in our private residential aged care sector. One is the son of the initial case – you recall the first case in Maidstone Arcare – he doesn’t work at the facility but is linked. One is a staff member at that same Arcare Maidstone who worked alongside that initial case. She was not vaccinated. She also worked at another aged care facility, the Blue Cross ACG Sunshine facility, on 26 and 27 and 28 of May. That has therefore triggered a strong public health response at the Blue Cross facility, similar to what was activated to contain measures at the Maidstone Arcare facility. And the third, additional case linked to the Arcare outbreak is unfortunately a resident. A woman in her 90s, within the Arcare Maidstone workplace where the initial case worked. She is asymptomatic and has been transferred to a separate hospital that we have established precisely for this risk. Our thoughts are clearly with the resident, with the workforce and communities and families they are all a part of ... indeed, our thoughts are with everyone who is impacted by this virus. This does not sound promising, in terms of the lockdown ending as scheduled. James Merlino: In the past 24 hours we identified many more points of concern. In addition to the very worrying cases in private aged car, we are very concerned about the number of other high-risk exposure sites. We are seeing a small number of cases infecting a large number of contacts. There is no doubt, the situation is incredibly serious. The next few days remain critical. I want to be very clear with everyone, this outbreak may well get worse before it gets better. I’m asking every single Victorian, if you have any symptoms whatsoever, please go and get tested. Check the exposure sites regularly and please keep following the rules to keep you, your family or community and everyone in Victoria safe. This is not over and we need to keep going. I’m just leaving Scott Morrison’s opening remarks from New Zealand, as acting Victorian premier James Merlino has stepped up to update us on the Victorian situation. Merlino: There are currently 54 active cases of coronavirus in Victoria. I can also advise there are a further six locally acquired cases that came through after the late-night cut-off, and a public health teams are urgently investigating and interviewing these cases. Of the cases formally reported today, two relate to the city of Whittlesea outbreak, one is a contact of a previous case linked to the Star car wash and one source of acquisition is under investigation. We are managing 4200 primary close contacts across all of our exposure sites. This is indeed very sad news. Prime ministers Scott Morrison and Jacinda Ardern are holding their press conference following the bilateral talks in New Zealand. We will bring you some of this but will have to return to it later as we’re prioritising the Victorian press conferenceg, which is due to start very soon. Ardern: We have shared our learnings, information and work collaboratively as we navigate COVID-19. The COVID challenge that we all face is writ large at the moment and I did want to acknowledge the people of Victoria and just say that everyone in New Zealand is thinking of you at this time. We have had our fair share of challenges and we understand what it is like when you reach another hurdle, but we have absolute faith it is a hurdle you will come out on the other side of and we look forward to welcoming you back on our shores again soon. Here was Michael McCormack on why the federal government doesn’t need to step in and help Victorian workers through this lockdown: We have already provided $40bn, 40,000 million dollars for Victoria to help their economy, to support their businesses. We provided that, we have done it to make sure that we Victorian businesses going, to keep their employees engaged with those businesses. A week in the scheme of things is not a long time in the whole scheme of things, in an 18-month [period]. Funny - I don’t think landlords and utility companies feel quite the same way about “a week not being a long time in the whole scheme of things’’. Anyone who has lived week-to-week - or day-to-day - with their finances knows EXACTLY how long a deal a week is, in the scheme of things. I don’t know what it would be like to be going through a fourth lockdown, particularly after what Victorians went through last year. But to see the virus back in aged care homes, after everything we saw happen, all the families left heartbroken - it is just devastating. We are all hoping the virus does not spread, and that those who have been diagnosed recover, and swiftly. I am so, so sorry people are going through this again. So that is three aged care workers who have been diagnosed with Covid in Victoria, and one resident (in this latest outbreak). Vulnerable Australians were meant to be vaccinated by Easter. This was reported on Melbourne radio this morning and has been confirmed. Victoria will hold its press conference at 12.15pm. So we’ll dip out of the prime minister’s to bring you that. With Covid cases having now emerged in Victoria’s aged care system, we’ve had readers questioning who some of those staff appear to have been working across multiple facilities. Staff in casual or insecure work who needed to work across multiple facilities to make ends meet were a key factor in Victoria’s second wave last year, which resulted in almost 700 people dying in aged care. As a result, the federal government changed its guidelines for the aged care homes it manages (the majority of aged care homes are federally run). According to the federal government guidelines: Workers who have more than one aged care employer will choose a primary employer – which must be the employer they work most hours per week with, if they are to access Australian government assistance – and that facility will employ them for at least their total normal hours by providing additional hours equal to or greater than the hours they were working elsewhere.’’ But here’s the catch; the guidelines are not mandatory. I’ve contacted the office of the federal aged care minister Richard Colbeck to ask if this policy has changed recently, and whether staff ideally are still required to work at just one facility. Both BlueCross and Arcare in Victoria, where staff have been infected in the current outbreak, are federally funded homes. We are seeking to confirm the BlueCross case, and Arcare issued a statement earlier confirming its cases. An Arcare statement issued on Sunday said there was “limited” staff movement between facilities. My colleague Nino Bucci is trying to confirm with the facility exactly what limited movement means. Meanwhile the Victorian government has a policy for its homes that: “Where practicable, care facility workers should be limited to working at one facility.” So again, not mandatory. We’ll hear from prime minister Scott Morrison at midday (AEST). He’s speaking in New Zealand following his meetings with his counterpart Jacinda Ardern. Michael Daley is back in contention for leadership of the NSW Labor party. You may remember he was forced to apologise after this video surfaced just ahead of the NSW election (which Labor lost) in 2019. Understandably, many Asian-Australian members of the Labor party have a bit to say about the situation and have released this statement: So what we know so far: There are now two workers at the Arcare Maidstone aged care home who have tested positive for Covid One resident at the centre has also tested positive, and has been taken to hospital as a precaution. There is a possible third aged care worker who has tested positive for Covid at another aged care home – Blue Cross Western Gardens. Callers to Melbourne radio stations this morning were talking about that, but we are still waiting for confirmation from Victoria Health. I contacted Victoria’s Department of Health to find out whether the staff member who tested positive for Covid who works at Blue Cross Western Gardens at Sunshine is the same staff member who tested positive at Arcare Maidstone, or whether they are two different separate cases. Staff are still working across different facilities, so it could be that one case is being counted as a positive staff member at both facilities. A spokeswoman from the Department of Health didn’t answer the question, telling me: Please watch out for the press conference later this morning. She did not say what time that would be. This follows Bill Shorten’s interview this morning, where he said he had been informed there were additional cases at the Arcare Maidstone aged care home – the operators have confirmed a second staff member and a resident have tested positive for Covid. Scott Morrison’s office have released the remarks (to the media) he made at the meeting he had with Jacinda Ardern in New Zealand: People often ask us, is this a partnership, it’s far more than a partnership. It is a family relationship between Australia and New Zealand. We have some very serious times that we’re dealing with, not just from the health point of view but obviously from a regional security point of view and Australia and New Zealand take a very prominent role in the Pacific, and I thank you for the relationship we’ve had working on particularly those issues in the Pacific. It is true that Australia and New Zealand has done very well in the course of Covid. But as you can see in Victoria now, those challenges persist. And equally in Fiji, they are dealing with the challenges, and Papua New Guinea, they are dealing with challenges. We’re supporting all of our Pacific family through our vaccine dose delivery into those regions and supporting them in their vaccinations. But the broader issue of the Indo-Pacific and a free and open Indo-Pacific is something Australia and New Zealand feels very strongly about. And working with our like-minded partners all around the world, the United States and the United Kingdom, and as we’re discussing across Europe, Japan and India, all of us have a big stake in ensuring a world that favours freedom and a free and open Indo-Pacific. And so we greatly appreciate the partnership we have to achieve those outcomes. So with those issues all on the table today, we should, we should move on and get on with it. I really appreciate the direct personal relationship and dialogue we’ve had and, and that will only continue because we have common challenges, there are common threats, and that has always I think eclipsed everything when it comes to the strength of the working family relationship. NSW Health has also updated its vaccination numbers NSW has recorded no locally acquired cases in the last 24 hours. Two people in hotel quarantine have tested positive for the virus. Last week I wrote about how overcrowding in Victoria’s healthcare system is a “bigger public health emergency than Covid”, according to a leading emergency physician who says the state’s doctors and nurses were exhausted even before the latest outbreak. The Australasian College for Emergency Medicine Victoria faculty chair, Dr Mya Cubitt, said on Friday that doctors and nurses in public hospitals had been dreading such a situation because they were still recovering from Victoria’s second wave in 2020. She added that the overcrowding issue was occuring Australia-wide. Since the article was published I’ve had emergency healthcare workers contact me sharing their stories, including an emergency department registrar in an inner-city Melbourne hospital. She told me: I would definitely agree that staff are burnt out; our waiting rooms are almost always full now and our patient populations are, generally speaking, older and multi-morbid. The incidence and acuity of people presenting with mental ill health in terms of substance and alcohol misuse, dementia and depression, self-harm and suicidality is certainly higher, which is especially difficult to manage and discharge safely in acuity in the ED, as well as often being emotionally charged and challenging for staff to deal with. The gaping chasm of ill health between either end of socioeconomic spectrum is more evident than ever too; homelessness and the health risk conferred by housing instability is especially challenging this winter following a financially difficult year for so many. A lot of analogies continue to be drawn about how this pandemic is a marathon rather than a sprint, but at least we know a marathon definitely ends after 42km and I think not knowing definitively when normality may resume in our personal and professional lives compounded by widespread discourse and reluctance around vaccinations (like anti-vaxx posters stuck on lamp posts outside the hospital!) exacerbates the challenge.” The registrar said she worked in a London emergency department last year until December, before returning to her family in Melbourne. She has an academic interest in social determinants of health. She told me the sentiment among her Melbourne peers “is that we are all working flat out but especially with young mental health patients the system is so strained and there’s a bubbling consensus that we don’t often feel as though we are really ‘fixing’ someone anymore”. I think in the UK/Europe the legacy of the pandemic will be the deaths and hospitalisations and morbidity from the virus itself which is predominantly an older demographic, whereas here the knock-on effects from lockdown, financial hardship, worsening family violence and social isolation as drivers of significant mental ill-health amongst young people will likely be an issue for a long time to come. I’m not sure what the answer or an alternative would have been though and Australia’s response to avoid a situation like Europe’s at all cost is wholly appropriate – many people, including those now presenting to ED disgruntled with vaccine side effects and sharing their negative experiences, don’t often realise how lucky they are as had they contracted the virus itself they would have likely died.” We are still waiting to hear when the Victorian press conference will be held. There are reports of positive Covid cases in two different aged care homes – but we are still waiting on official confirmation. Given we are still deporting people who were born in New Zealand but came to Australia as babies/small children and lived their entire lives here, if they are convicted of a crime, this is probably not something Scott Morrison will be embracing: Trying to get yourself “cancelled” (something that doesn’t exist) by claiming you have been “cancelled” (refer to previous parentheses) in a little-seen social media post to try and further your political career is sadly not a new tactic. Pauline Hanson is still in the Senate. We are still waiting on the press conference when this will all be confirmed. Uptake of the seasonal flu vaccine in children has risen as a result of increased funding and awareness, according to a paper published today in the Medical Journal of Australia. In 2020, the proportion of flu-vaccinated children aged between six to 59 months rose to 43.9%, representing “a significant improvement from past low vaccination rates”. The annual influenza vaccine is recommended for all Australians aged six months and older, with free vaccines for high-risk groups provided by the national immunisation program. The highest annual hospitalisation rates for the seasonal flu are in infants aged less than six months, followed by children aged between six and 23 months. Until recently, funding for the flu vaccine in children was limited, the report’s authors said. In 2020, the vaccine was added to the national immunisation program for all children aged six to 59 months. The number of influenza vaccine doses available for all Australians has also increased, from 8.3m doses distributed in 2017 to 18m doses in 2020. “Australia needs strategies to improve and sustain high coverage,” the authors wrote. “These could include personalised vaccination reminders and provision of greater access to influenza vaccination services.” Also happening today: Townsville will find out if it will host the State of Origin opener if the lockdown forces the game to be moved from Melbourne. This is an actual federal government announcement for aged care workers. Take a look at the advice for under-50s (who are recommended to have the Pfizer vaccine). You can get a dose, where doses are available. And then hope you can get a second dose, if there are doses left over. If not, kindly work it out. This is the program the federal government is running. In case anyone was wondering, Scott Morrison is still in New Zealand. Australia’s IPL cricket players have completed their quarantine in Sydney and have been released. It has only been 28 days since Michael Slater tweeted this. There are still Australians trying to get home from India (and around the world). We will hear a breakdown of the cases – and whether they are all linked – very soon. These numbers are incredible though – 16,752 vaccines administered and 43,874 tests. Thank you Victoria. You have shouldered such a huge, isolating burden during the past 18 months – and you keep showing up. I can’t pretend to know what it has been like, but I thank you. The numbers have just come in We are at the refreshing of the Victorian Health site stage of the morning while we wait for today’s numbers. So far we have not received confirmation on Bill Shorten’s information that one, possibly two, other people at the Arcare Maidstone aged care home have tested positive for Covid. Everyone is waiting for today’s announcement. Jim Chalmers, who in the last couple of weeks has been labelled a “shadow of a shadow minister” by Josh Frydenberg, who likes to repeat things he finds very clever – but should probably be tested outside the mirror before making their public debut – is doing all he can not to scream “vindication” over the hard stop on jobkeeper in these comments (but not quite getting there). Victorians wouldn’t be in this position if the prime minister had got the vaccination rollout and the quarantine build right from the beginning. I think it’s entirely reasonable that the Victorian people are frustrated, and anxious, and possibly angry. I say to the prime minister that all they expected of Scott Morrison was some competence when it comes to the vaccine rollout and the quarantine bill, and some compassion when it comes to economic support. They’re getting neither competence, nor compassion, from this prime minister. The Victorian business community is being strangled by the prime minister’s failures on vaccinations and quarantine. It didn’t take long for this prime minister and this treasurer to go from “we’re all in this together” to now all of a sudden Victorians are all on their own. This is a treasurer who likes to parade his Victorian credentials when it suits him, when there’s a photo op in it for him, but when Victorians really need this treasurer he’s gone missing once again. Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg are leaving Victorians high and dry in their hour of need. What we want to see is the state government and the federal government working together to provide the necessary support to ensure the Victorians can get through a really difficult period. Jim Chalmers held a doorstop interview this morning to discuss the need for federal financial assistance for workers during Victoria’s lockdown: We have seen the state government come to the table with a support package the federal government should, too. Ideally, there would be some kind of income support, whether it is jobkeeper or perhaps they have got a better way of doing it. We have said all along that economic support should be tailored to the economic conditions. We are worried that this government is very quick to pull economic support, but very slow to roll out the vaccines and take responsibility for quarantine. The other issue bubbling alongside Victoria’s fourth lockdown – sparked by a hotel quarantine breach in Adelaide – is who will support workers who have just lost a week’s worth of pay. Dan Tehan said people could go to Centrelink and apply for a payment – but that is only for people who have been ordered to isolate, or quarantine – not for people in lockdown, who can still leave the house for one of the five essential reasons. (Always better to check these things before saying them on national television.) Josh Frydenberg hasn’t said there will be no assistance – just none right now. This was his response on Facebook yesterday, following criticism from the Victorian government about the Morrison government going MIA: Since the end of jobkeeper Victoria is the third state to introduce a short lockdown. Greater Brisbane was subject to stay-at-home orders from 29 March to 1 April, the Perth metropolitan and Peel region was under stay-at-home orders from 24 to 27 April and Victoria is currently under stay-at-home orders from 28 May to 3 June. In both the Queensland and Western Australian lockdowns further federal support was not required. In the case of Victoria, the Morrison government has provided and continues to provide an unprecedented level of direct economic support. Over $45bn has already flowed to Victorian families and businesses during Covid, with more direct federal economic support per capita going to Victoria than to any other state. The amount of federal government direct economic support delivered to Victoria is around three times what has been delivered by the state government. The federal government continues to provide support to Victorian families and businesses through this pandemic. The pandemic leave disaster payment of $1,500 is available as is the national health emergency crisis payment. For businesses that experience losses, the loss carry-back measure is available to boost cash flow at the end of the financial year. The economic impact of the Victorian outbreak is not insignificant but the budget just over two weeks ago did anticipate further outbreaks would occur. Our budget measures were calibrated accordingly, with the budget providing an additional $41bn of Covid-related economic support. Should extended lockdowns be avoided and outbreaks contained the national economy can continue its strong recovery. The Morrison government will continue to work with the Victorian government and closely monitor the situation. I’m not sure what good it is telling people they received a higher share of financial help previously is, when they need help now. And it is possible other Australian jurisdictions will be in the same spot. The last sentence is the interesting one there – “closely monitor the situation” is usually code for, “if this gets worse, we’ll have to do something”. Which is cold comfort for people who have seen all their shifts disappear, with no warning, just as they were starting to get back on their feet. There are now 268 exposure sites on the Victorian Health website Former Labor MP Emma Husar, who was forced to resign from the federal parliament after “slut-shaming” allegations were reported against her (an investigation into the allegations later found no basis for the salacious claims against her and Husar subsequently won a defamation action against Buzzfeed) wants an apology from Anthony Albanese (as leader) and damages from the Labor party. Bill Shorten was leader at the time, and is asked whether Husar deserves an apology from the Labor party: I do think that Emma – she was on the receiving end of some poor treatment, too. So I have spoken to her in the past. I regret the way she was treated. I don’t say that covers all of the matters, but, yes, I think there were some people in New South Wales Labor who didn’t treat her well. Emma and I have had our own conversations on this matter. I do, in part, feel for her. I don’t think she was all in the wrong here. So is that a yes or no? Listen, Anthony wasn’t the leader then. I am not going the get into that. Certainly for my own view, I think she received some pretty unfair treatment and I am happy to say that. Somehow, the government has managed to get stuck on the word “race” – as in being in competition with something, in this case, a highly contagious virus – and whether Australia is in one when it comes to a vaccine program. Scott Morrison has said on multiple occasions in regards to a vaccine rollout that we are “not in a race” or “this isn’t a race”. The lack of urgency from the government is one reason people are citing for delaying receiving their vaccine if they are eligible. With Victoria in lockdown, the whole country has had a reminder of why we are actually in a fairly urgent situation, because Covid can shut down whole communities and economies at any moment. Shorten was asked by the ABC whether or not Australia was “in a race” when it came to the vaccine this morning: Well, it is now. I think there has been a degree of complacency, not just by the government, but perhaps amongst Australians – if there is no outbreak of Covid then the urge to get the vaccine doesn’t seem as great. We have seen people in Melbourne who are switched on to these matters, the vaccination rates have increased and the queues have got longer because now there is an outbreak. I would suggest to my fellow Australians, once there is an outbreak, queuing up to get the vaccination seems to be too slow, to me. Perhaps we need to get up from our kitchen tables and lounge chairs and I would say to people in states and towns which haven’t had to go through the lockdown that my hometown of Melbourne is going through, don’t wait until the lockdown to get vaccinated. Simple common sense says if there is Covid anywhere it could affect any of us at any time. Bill Shorten is on ABC News Breakfast saying he understands one resident or “possibly two” at the Arcare Maidstone aged care home have tested positive for Covid – as well as an aged care worker. This is not confirmed by Victorian health authorities as yet. Shorten: Worryingly both the staff member who recorded positive but one resident, possibly two, but one resident who appears to have contracted Covid were both vaccinated in the first round, so it just emphasises to me and I think to everyone listening that two vaccinations is what we need and when I heard the federal government saying one vaccination somehow is a goal, well, as I understand it, it is only secondhand reports from the facility, but the people who are sick actually had had a vaccination, so you need two. One is not enough. We should receive the Victorian numbers very soon. Yesterday, there were five locally acquired cases. It’s the mystery case which has authorities worried – cases which can’t be linked to a previous infection tend to be the ones which extend lockdowns. Hopefully we will find out very soon what the state of play is. And the Oz has reported the LNP has blocked Queensland MP George Christensen’s bid for the $105,600 “resettlement” allowance after he announced his decision to quit the federal parliament at the next election. The allowance is open to MPs who are disendorsed or lose their seat – anyone who “retires involuntarily”. Christensen announced his own retirement. Meanwhile, Sarah Martin has an Andrew Laming update: The controversial Liberal MP Andrew Laming, who returned to parliament earlier this month after undergoing empathy training, has defended another $15,000 in grants that went to organisations run by a local LNP branch president, Guardian Australia can reveal. In the latest round of the Stronger Communities grant program in Laming’s electorate, two grants were awarded to Redlands Salad Bowl and Community Connections Redlands Coast, both of which were co-founded by the president of the Liberal National party’s Redlands branch, Craig Luxton. The secretary of both organisations is Laming’s own electorate officer, Stephanie Eaton. Australia is still waiting to learn who its ambassador from the US will be under the Biden administration – Axios has reported it could be a Kennedy. The US media network reports that Caroline Kennedy, who served as a second ambassador to Japan during the Obama administration, is in line for Canberra. AAP has the latest on the mystery Covid case in a Melbourne aged care home: A Melbourne aged care worker’s “mystery case” has authorities worried, as fellow staff members and residents prepare for more COVID-19 testing and vaccinations. Arcare Maidstone residents were locked down and placed into self-isolation on Sunday after a female healthcare worker at the facility tested positive. The Altona woman worked at the site in the city’s northwest on Wednesday and Thursday and may have been infectious at the time. Arcare chief executive Colin Singh said no other staff members or residents had returned positive results but further testing was planned for Tuesday. “We know this is an anxious time, but we ask that you please do not call asking for the results,” Mr Singh wrote in a letter. The Altona woman, one of five local cases reported on Sunday, tested positive despite receiving her first coronavirus jab on May 12. Only a third of Arcare Maidstone’s 110 staff and 53 of 76 residents have been vaccinated so far, and the federal government has brought forward scheduled vaccinations to Monday. Happy Monday, everyone. Welcome back to Guardian Australia – you have a hybrid blog today. Parliament isn’t sitting as it’s Reconciliation Day in the ACT and therefore a public holiday, but all the MPs are still in town, which means you get a dose of politics. But of course, most attention is on Victoria and the fourth lockdown, particularly as authorities try to work out the link to a mystery Covid cases – a person who worked in an aged care facility. People who are vulnerable to Covid were meant to have been vaccinated by Easter. At the end of May, we still have aged care homes where no doses of the vaccine have been administered. What we did get this weekend though, was the deputy prime minister, and senior ministers, argue about whether it should be a “race” or not to vaccinate Australians against a virus which has caused a worldwide pandemic. We’ll cover everything that’s happening in Canberra, Victoria and anywhere else you need to know about. You’ve got Amy Remeikis with you for most of the day, along with the Guardian brains trust. It’s a chilly day in Canberra so it’s already a two-coffee and a tea situation – hope you’re warm and ready to get into it.","charCount":"56741","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/amy-remeikis\">Amy Remeikis</a>"},{"headline":"Caroline Kennedy reportedly in line to be next US ambassador to Australia","standfirst":"<p>Daughter of former president John F Kennedy was US ambassador to Japan during Obama administration</p>","trailText":"Daughter of former president John F Kennedy was US ambassador to Japan during Obama administration","byline":"Guardian staff","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aa92bfa97ea42b28fca5902e5b9b15a231747cd0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa92bfa97ea42b28fca5902e5b9b15a231747cd0/0_0_2736_1642/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Caroline Kennedy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Website Axios<em> </em>has<em> </em>reported Caroline Kennedy is in line to be next US ambassador to Australia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charles Krupa/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Caroline Kennedy, the only surviving child of President John F Kennedy, is reportedly in line to be announced as the next US ambassador to Australia.</p> <p>US-based news website Axios<em>,</em> citing “people familiar with the matter” reported: “Caroline Kennedy is in line to be US ambassador to Australia”, while the AP said the US president, Joe Biden, was “giving serious consideration” to nominating Kennedy to a high-profile ambassadorial role in Asia.</p> <p>Kennedy was formerly the US ambassador to Japan during the Obama administration.</p> <p>The White House declined to comment.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/aug/23/the-big-picture-a-tender-family-moment-with-jfk\">The big picture: a tender family moment with JFK</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kennedy, a scion of one of America’s most high-profile political families, threw her support behind Biden relatively early in the crowded 2020 Democratic primary process.</p> <p>Along with her uncle, senator Ted Kennedy, she also offered a critical early endorsement to Obama in his 2008 run for the White House.</p> <p>Caroline, born in 1957, is the only surviving child of the former president Kennedy and his wife Jacqueline.

US-based news website Axios, citing “people familiar with the matter” reported: “Caroline Kennedy is in line to be US ambassador to Australia”, while the AP said the US president, Joe Biden, was “giving serious consideration” to nominating Kennedy to a high-profile ambassadorial role in Asia. Kennedy was formerly the US ambassador to Japan during the Obama administration. The White House declined to comment. Kennedy, a scion of one of America’s most high-profile political families, threw her support behind Biden relatively early in the crowded 2020 Democratic primary process. Along with her uncle, senator Ted Kennedy, she also offered a critical early endorsement to Obama in his 2008 run for the White House. Caroline, born in 1957, is the only surviving child of the former president Kennedy and his wife Jacqueline. She was only five when her father was assassinated in Dallas in November 1963. It was the first of a series of tragedies for the privileged but ill-fated US family. A brother, Patrick, died in infancy in 1963. Her uncle Robert Kennedy was assassinated in 1968, and another brother, John, died in a plane crash in 1999. Axios has reported that Biden was considering another Kennedy, Ted Kennedy’s widow, Vicki, for an ambassadorial posting in western Europe. Australia’s previous ambassador to Australia, Arthur Culvahouse Jr, finished his appointment with the end of the Trump presidency in January this year. Before his appointment, the post was vacant for nearly two and a half years after Obama appointee John Berry departed. The US mission to Australia is currently headed by chargé d’affaires Michael Goldman. Biden is expected to soon announce his first major tranche of political ambassadorial nominations, according to White House officials. The AP has previously reported he is expected to nominate former senior state department official Nicholas Burns to serve in China, Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti in India, former Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel in Japan, and former deputy secretary of state Tom Nides to Israel. Ken Salazar, a former colleague of Biden’s in the Senate and Obama-era interior department secretary, is a candidate for the Mexico ambassadorship. Cindy McCain, the widow of Republican senator John McCain and a longtime friend of the president and first lady, Jill Biden, is under consideration for an ambassadorial position, including leading the UN World Food Program.

I celebrated at a favourite burger joint, slurping a milkshake as big as my head and dancing around the table to Daft Punk, even as news broke that an outbreak in my home state of Victoria foreshadowed another lockdown. Even as my needled arm began to gently throb. Missing a childhood measles vaccine almost killed me; it’s now unlikely coronavirus will have that chance. I woke up the next day with a warned-of hazy brain, a little nausea and a strong feeling I may need to gnaw my aching arm from a bear trap. Mostly, however, I felt relieved – as if the one decision I made to try my luck with eligibility, book an appointment and hop to the pop-up clinic at my local Mercure has negated a lifetime of more – ahem – questionable self-care choices. As an Australian, I’m lucky that I got my jab. I’m also confounded why luck had to come into it. Australia is a prosperous western nation with a cohesive public healthcare system, but the Morrison Liberal government has spectacularly mismanaged the vaccine rollout, blaming supply shortages and relying on a “hermit kingdom” shut-border containment policy. Now the virus is spreading again and a local firewall of vaccinations that may limit spread of this devastating “Indian strain” isn’t built. So the political rhetoric has switched and citizens are now copping the blame for under-vaccination, government MPs deployed to fault us for our own “vaccine hesitancy”. “Vaccine hesitancy” is a term the World Health Organization uses to describe why people don’t get vaccinations when vaccines are available. In Australia, we sometimes hear about it as a potential effect of aggressive anti-vaccination campaigns. The idea is that the problematising of vaccination dissuades other people from participating in it. Vaccine hesitancy, though, is complex and context-specific. Dropping a term with strong anti-vaxx associations into the discourse around Australia’s low coronavirus vaccination rate is a sly bait-and-switch that demonises victims of the vaccination rollout failure in lieu of addressing it. Yes, pandemic-related distress has certainly seduced increasing numbers of Australians into conspiracist beliefs – like anti-vaxxism – but these beliefs still remain marginal to the majority. Yes, there have been aggressive attempts from hard-right agitators to insist coronavirus is a hoax (it isn’t) and that vaccines are a scam (they aren’t) and something-something-government-overreach-don’t-tread-on-me (whatever). A couple of hundred people marching against lockdowns in Melbourne last week is still only a couple of hundred people in a city of 5 million and numbers are not growing from last year. If you’re still seeing anti-vaxx material online, it’s not because of a mass movement behind it. It might just be the online Russian-influence operations which have been sprung pushing such messages in the past. The reality is that Australians are overwhelmingly predisposed to embracing public health measures without complaint. Dr Aaron Martin from the University of Melbourne describes mainstream Australia more accurately as a “pragmatic” community, not bound to historical rebellious individualism that dogs American attitudes. Monash’s Prof Graeme Davison also argues that Australians habitually and consistently appreciate collective measures for public safety. His evidence? Seatbelts, breathalysers … oh, and our recently demonstrated mass compliance with mask mandates and lockdown directives. There’s further proof: 6,000 Victorians got vaccinated two weeks ago, but in the wake of the new outbreak, 15,000 Victorians were jabbed in a single day. That doesn’t sound like “hesitancy”. It sounds like they may have had the pure good luck that I did to hear Victoria’s acting premier James Merlino announce there’s “no problem” with the state’s vaccine supply. Alas, within the Morrison government’s relentless vaccination mess lies a staggering confusion of messages, despite a whopping $40m spent on an ad campaign. Significant numbers of vaccine-eligible Australians don’t know they’re eligible or that the vaccines are now in plentiful supply.

Into this information morass stumbled the government’s hopeless PR mishandling of a scare campaign about a six-in-a-million blood clot risk from the AstraZeneca vaccine that overshadowed the coronavirus’s 20,000-in-a-million fatality rate. Is Australia really in the grip of “vaccine hesitancy” or is the national affliction “government vaccine failure, leading to total confusion”?

When the coach calls the players in, the goalers will almost always try to sink one last shot before joining the group. It was this unremarkable ritual that helped Melbourne Vixens debutant Rahni Samason stun the netball world over the weekend.</p> <p>Samason – who was not even a Super Netball training partner a week ago – starred in her first outing at the elite level on Saturday, when the 23-year-old sunk the winning super shot after the siren to secure a 66-64 win over the Firebirds.</p> <p>It was the reigning premiers’ first victory this season, on the court where they claimed the title last year, and with the same final score. In those pre-training sessions, Samason said she plays out her netballing fantasies in her head.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/may/17/netballs-not-a-tough-sport-players-let-game-do-talking-in-brutal-riposte\">Netball’s not a tough sport?

The MVP performance also made Samason an overnight star, with her name trending on Twitter on Saturday.</p> <p>At goal shooter, where she has played virtually all her netball, and goal attack, Samason finished the Indigenous Round match with 27/29 at 93% accuracy, missing only two super shots. She had five centre pass receives, 16 feeds – 11 which led to attempts on goal by Kumwenda, who finished with 29/32 – and she took an intercept.</p> <p>She also employed a clever, but rarely seen throw-in tactic, where a shooter bounces the ball off the post, gets back on court, collects it and then shoots.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6c3f1d91a85ae21357cc3959271fce145e8944e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c3f1d91a85ae21357cc3959271fce145e8944e1/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rahni Samason of the Vixens\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rahni Samason sinks the match-winning goal top cap a sensational debut over the weekend.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason O’Brien/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Samason filled a gaping hole left by Caitlin Thwaites and Tegan Philip, who retired last year, and which new Vixens Kaylia Stanton and Ruby Barkmeyer have failed to plug.</p> <p>After a phone call just a few days earlier asking her to become a training partner, as she was in 2018, Samason was told on Wednesday she was in the squad for Brisbane and flew out of Victoria that night. A few hours before the match, in Vixens kit for the first time, she was told she would start.</p> <p>Standing in the circle before the first whistle, Samason was able to take a breath. “Standing at the back end of the court, you look at everything, you take it all in,” she said. “At that moment it was like ‘oh god, do I even know how to run? How do I catch and pass?’.</p> <p>“But as soon as I got the ball in my hand, I thought, ‘OK, I’ve done this millions of times before. It’s nothing different, now I’ve got more eyes on me’.”</p> <p>Samason’s debut was the stuff of dreams, especially given she has played only five games of competitive netball in nearly three years. In 2018, playing for the Victorian Fury in the now-defunct Australian Netball League, Samason won league MVP, but suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury post-season.</p> <p>It saw her miss the entire 2019 season as she rehabilitated at the Victorian Institute of Sport – serendipitously alongside Kumwenda, who was also coming back from an ACL. And although she was ready, she did not take to the court in 2020, as minor Victorian leagues were shelved due to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> <p>Returning in the Victorian Netball League for Melbourne-based Ariels in late April, Samason picked up where she left off in 2018, dominating and shooting at about 90% accuracy in the first five matches. Her form was irresistible to Vixens coach Simone McKinnis, who pre-game focused her young charge’s mind on what she could bring, and nothing else.</p> <p>“There wasn’t talk about outside stuff; pressure, the Vixens not having won a game, family in Melbourne, Covid, nothing.

When the coach calls the players in, the goalers will almost always try to sink one last shot before joining the group. It was this unremarkable ritual that helped Melbourne Vixens debutant Rahni Samason stun the netball world over the weekend. Samason – who was not even a Super Netball training partner a week ago – starred in her first outing at the elite level on Saturday, when the 23-year-old sunk the winning super shot after the siren to secure a 66-64 win over the Firebirds. It was the reigning premiers’ first victory this season, on the court where they claimed the title last year, and with the same final score. In those pre-training sessions, Samason said she plays out her netballing fantasies in her head. “You say to yourself, ‘there’s one second left on the clock, quickly shoot it’ or ‘you’ve just received a long bomb from Liz Watson, you’ve got to turn and deliver’,” she said. Deliver she did, calming knocking down her eighth super shot of the game in front of a stunned crowd at Brisbane’s Nissan Arena, after a last-gasp intercept by Kadie-Ann Dehaney and penalty by Firebird Rudi Ellis on Mwai Kumwenda, who left the ball for her junior partner. The cool-as-ice shot – that Samason was a “little annoyed wasn’t a swish” – put a full stop on what has been described as the best debut in Australian netball history. The MVP performance also made Samason an overnight star, with her name trending on Twitter on Saturday. At goal shooter, where she has played virtually all her netball, and goal attack, Samason finished the Indigenous Round match with 27/29 at 93% accuracy, missing only two super shots. She had five centre pass receives, 16 feeds – 11 which led to attempts on goal by Kumwenda, who finished with 29/32 – and she took an intercept. She also employed a clever, but rarely seen throw-in tactic, where a shooter bounces the ball off the post, gets back on court, collects it and then shoots. Samason filled a gaping hole left by Caitlin Thwaites and Tegan Philip, who retired last year, and which new Vixens Kaylia Stanton and Ruby Barkmeyer have failed to plug. After a phone call just a few days earlier asking her to become a training partner, as she was in 2018, Samason was told on Wednesday she was in the squad for Brisbane and flew out of Victoria that night. A few hours before the match, in Vixens kit for the first time, she was told she would start. Standing in the circle before the first whistle, Samason was able to take a breath. “Standing at the back end of the court, you look at everything, you take it all in,” she said. “At that moment it was like ‘oh god, do I even know how to run? How do I catch and pass?’. “But as soon as I got the ball in my hand, I thought, ‘OK, I’ve done this millions of times before. It’s nothing different, now I’ve got more eyes on me’.” Samason’s debut was the stuff of dreams, especially given she has played only five games of competitive netball in nearly three years. In 2018, playing for the Victorian Fury in the now-defunct Australian Netball League, Samason won league MVP, but suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury post-season. It saw her miss the entire 2019 season as she rehabilitated at the Victorian Institute of Sport – serendipitously alongside Kumwenda, who was also coming back from an ACL. And although she was ready, she did not take to the court in 2020, as minor Victorian leagues were shelved due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Returning in the Victorian Netball League for Melbourne-based Ariels in late April, Samason picked up where she left off in 2018, dominating and shooting at about 90% accuracy in the first five matches. Her form was irresistible to Vixens coach Simone McKinnis, who pre-game focused her young charge’s mind on what she could bring, and nothing else. “There wasn’t talk about outside stuff; pressure, the Vixens not having won a game, family in Melbourne, Covid, nothing. It was, ‘this is the game right now and this is what we’re going to do’, which was great for me, because I like to focus on the present.” After such an eye-popping entrée, it’s easy to see why Vixens – and perhaps even Australian Diamonds – fans are thinking further ahead. Given injured Emily Mannix, who she replaced this round, remains unavailable, Samason is surely a lock for the Vixens’ round six clash with the Thunderbirds, which was meant to be played in Melbourne. Under contracting rules, it is also possible for Samason to be added to the Vixens’ squad of 10, although that would require someone else dropping out. She may be used as a training partner and elevated when needed. And despite being eligible for a New Zealand passport through her father Tai, who was born in the Cook Islands, Samason has no plans to defect. “There’s no risk of me running away, no.” What she does want to do is “develop and get better” after what she describes as a “good” start. And that’s a mouth-watering prospect for all netball fans.","charCount":"5045","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/erin-delahunty\">Erin Delahunty</a>"},{"headline":"‘They tortured me,’ Australian Yang Hengjun says as he awaits verdict after trial in China","standfirst":"<p>Australian writer says he fears hidden cameras captured forced confessions during interrogations</p>","trailText":"Australian writer says he fears hidden cameras captured forced confessions during interrogations","byline":"Ben Doherty","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4ff284d1e9630b519c45599168bd410408cb9801\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ff284d1e9630b519c45599168bd410408cb9801/164_245_1807_1085/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yang Hengjun with his wife Yuan Xiaoliang\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yang Hengjun with his wife Yuan Xiaoliang.

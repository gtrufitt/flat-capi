Last night, estimates heard there had been 21 breaches of hotel quarantine. It was a hotel quarantine breach in Adelaide which sparked the most recent Victorian lockdown. Jane Halton, who (among many, many other reviews) was handed the job of reviewing Australia’s hotel quarantine system, was asked on ABC radio RN this morning how she thought quarantine was going. She was fairly plain spoken: Well, I’m disappointed that it certainly appears that we don’t have continual adoption of best practice right across the system. One of the things I talked about in October last year is the need to make sure best practice is adopted. And as we’ve discussed before, this virus is not staying still waiting for us to catch up with it and get in front of it, the virus continues to change. That means our systems need to continue to adapt. And certainly, as it’s been reported, some of the breaches we have seen recently are a direct reflection of an absence of best practice in some of these systems. So to say that I’m disappointed about that I think is the minimum, I would say. Halton said while she welcomed the expansion of the Howard Springs dedicated quarantine facility, she also found it “a bit perplexing that it’s taken us this long”. Halton had recommended national quarantine facilities, purpose built to handle the job. She doesn’t care where they are - as long as they are built to purpose. I’m not wedded to one particular location over another. I think the style of quarantine that we’re talking about here is what’s important. And having that as a significant component of our quarantine program is certainly desirable. And that’s what I talked about. The interview finished with this: Hamish Macdonald: I know you’re someone who in Canberra has been known to be frank. Would your frank and fearless advice to government now be, ‘Alright, pull your socks up, get on with this’? Halton: Certainly, that is my advice. That we should be getting on with this as a priority. Definitely. The numbers are in. These six new cases bring the total number associated with this outbreak to 60. More than 51,000 tests though, and 20,500 vaccinations. That’s incredible, Victoria. In defending the federal government for not vaccinating aged care workers (in June), a group of people who were meant to be in the priority 1A group, Queensland senator Matt Canavan attacked the Queensland Labor government for not immediately vaccinating health care workers months ago. (The Queensland government, like Victoria, is launching its own vaccination blitz to speed up the vaccination roll out for aged and disability care workers) Canavan told the Nine Network: This is from the government only a few months ago had failed to vaccinate their frontline workers and partly led to the Brisbane outbreak. It’s a bit hypocritical for them to be throwing mud about aged care centres when they didn’t do the same in their own hospitals just a few months ago. Queensland is also the state with the lowest utilisation rate of the vaccines. They’ve never properly explained why they’ve only used 64% of their vaccines when Victoria and NSW are 80%. Maybe Queensland will finally start using its vaccines, that will be a positive. For reasons unknown to anyone, members of the federal government continue to argue over whether or not the vaccine roll out is “a race”. Here was Dan Tehan on the Seven Network this morning: If it was a race, how would you handicap at? Let’s get serious about this. It is a rollout, I can tell you I’ll be having my second vaccination this week and I say to all Australians listening to the show, go up, get vaccinated. That’s the best thing all of us can do. Labor has announced a new ‘youth engagement’ model: If elected, an Albanese Labor government will:- Establish a framework to directly and formally engage with young Australians on an ongoing basis. Establish an Office for Youth so that, rather than youth engagement being an afterthought or duplicating functions across departments, there is a dedicated unit within government to feed in the contribution from young people and advocates, improve and harmonise policy across government, and ensure government is communicating effectively with young people. Commit to a Minister for Youth to improve and facilitate a holistic response across portfolios on issues affecting young Australians. The ABC has reported the crew member who tested positive to Covid and was removed from a freight ship docked in WA has now tested negative. He is thought to be a historical case. We are all still waiting on official confirmation of today’s results (as well as official word on the lockdown being extended) but this is hopefully some good news. It being June means Mathias Cormann is officially the OECD head. As part of his maiden speech Cormann, apparently a huge fan of the Paris agreement now, said: Across the OECD’s diverse membership, different countries and regions around the world have different opportunities to make the strongest possible contribution to our collective emissions reduction outcomes and the net-zero emissions target locked into the Paris Agreement. We all face similar transition challenges and can all agree that effective global action on climate change is a must and we must get to zero net emissions as soon as possible. Climate policy responses will increasingly need to factor into long-term planning. Economic recovery efforts to Covid-19 are a key opportunity to target support towards investments that drive the development and commercialisation of new technologies. Through the OECD, we can come together to share ideas about our collective green recovery effort on our journey towards a low emissions future. As Secretary-General I will strive to make the OECD a place that inspires collaboration and action in support of a sustainable future. We start today with NSW authorities worried about potential for Covid to have spread, after a Melbourne traveller was potentially infectious while on holiday. The reason for the worry is because of the highly contagious nature of this variant of Covid. Victorian authorities have spoken about how they are seeing more stranger to stranger transmission with this variant. It’s not just spending time with people which can spread the virus, it could be passing them in a small store. Hence the worry. We’ll be keeping an eye on that today, and will bring you all the Victorian news as we wait to see whether or not the lockdown will be lifted. Unfortunately, it’s not looking overly positive at the moment, with all signs pointing to the lockdown being extended beyond Thursday. There are still a lot of primary and secondary contacts in isolation and the list of exposure sites sits at more than 500. We’ll bring you the news as soon as we know for sure. Parliament and estimates continues today as well. Richard Colbeck, the aged care minister, didn’t have the best day yesterday, as he struggled to answer simple questions like ‘who is responsible for vaccinating aged care workers’. Then there was some friendly fire, with Amanda Stoker, a Liberal senator, questioning James McGrath, also a Liberal senator, over what questions he was allowing as chair of the committee. McGrath beat Stoker to the number one spot on the Queensland ticket, leaving Stoker at number three (winnable, but not guaranteed). We’ll bring you all the day’s events. You have Mike Bowers with you as always, taking you into the parliament, with Katharine Murphy, Paul Karp, Daniel Hurst and Sarah Martin keeping you updated on what’s happening around parliament. It being a sitting day, you’ll have Amy Remeikis on the blog for most of the day. I just had chocolate cake for breakfast so it’s going to be great.

One of its solutions has been to stress the importance of funding digital methods for tracking immigrants rather than physically imprisoning them. The digital alternatives program has been growing in recent years, with funding increasing from $28m in 2006 to $440m in 2021.</p> \n  <p>The “alternatives to detention” program tracks 96,574 individuals, but the Biden administration’s 2022 budget request calls to increase that number by approximately 45,000 to 140,000.</p> \n  <p>These <a href=\"https://joebiden.com/immigration/\">alternatives</a> “support migrants as they navigate their legal obligations”, the Biden administration has said, and are meant to be less-harmful alternatives to physical detention.

Since then, more than 380 bills have been introduced across the country that would make it harder for Americans to vote,” she said. These bills seek to restrict the options that make voting more convenient and accessible, including early voting and vote by mail.”</p> \n  <p>Harris and Joe Biden have long endorsed the Democrats’ two major voting rights bills – which face a steep road ahead. In the Senate, Republicans and some moderate Democrats like Joe Manchin of West Virginia have opposed the For the People Act. Manchin called it “too darn broad” and partisan. He, Arizona’s Kyrsten Sinema and other Democrats have also resisted their colleague’s efforts to pass the bill by gutting the filibuster, a procedural obstacle that prevents most bills that don’t have the support of at least 60 senators from ever getting a vote. </p> \n  <p>It’s unclear what, if anything, Harris could do to change these realities. Having served in the Senate for four years, she has some ties in the chamber. But Biden, who served in the chamber for nine times has long, is thought to have much deeper relationships with Senators – and has been unable to win them over. </p> \n  <p>“I will work with voting rights organizations, community organizations, and the private sector to help strengthen and uplift efforts on voting rights nationwide,” Harris said. “And we will also work with members of Congress to help advance these bills.”</p> \n  <p>Harris has also been tasked with diplomatic efforts in the Northern Triangle, leading the efforts to expand broadband internet and other issues. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-06-01T22:24:02.893Z\">at 11.24pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-60b6aab88f08b9889b365f4a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/joannawalters\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-01T21:54:29.785Z\">10.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Biden closed out his speech in Oklahoma this afternoon by comparing white supremacist atrocities in the past, such as the Tulsa massacre, to extremist threats today.</strong></p> \n  <p>“We must address what remains the stain on the soul of America.

A new report called Ice Digital Prisons, authored by the Latinx organizing group Mijente and immigration legal rights group Just Futures Law, highlights how Ice uses apps, GPS-tracking ankle monitors and facial recognition software to monitor people – saying these tactics “do more harm and inhibit any true progress in providing the social and economic tools for immigrants to thrive in their communities”. The report says that the use of such technologies further criminalizes immigrants and affects their social and economic wellbeing. The Biden administration is under growing pressure to right the wrongs of the Trump administration’s immigration policies and keep families out of detention facilities. One of its solutions has been to stress the importance of funding digital methods for tracking immigrants rather than physically imprisoning them. The digital alternatives program has been growing in recent years, with funding increasing from $28m in 2006 to $440m in 2021. The “alternatives to detention” program tracks 96,574 individuals, but the Biden administration’s 2022 budget request calls to increase that number by approximately 45,000 to 140,000. These alternatives “support migrants as they navigate their legal obligations”, the Biden administration has said, and are meant to be less-harmful alternatives to physical detention. But Julie Mao, an immigration attorney with Just Futures Law and an editor on the report, said that is not the case. Read more: A proposal to be tabled by the US president, Joe Biden, at the upcoming G7 meeting for a 15% global corporate tax rate could reap the EU €50bn (£43bn) a year, and earn the UK nearly €200m extra alone from the British multinational BP, according to research. Should the tax rate be set higher at 25%, the lowest current rate within the seven largest world economies, the EU would earn nearly €170bn extra a year – more than 50% of current corporate tax revenue and 12% of total health spending in the bloc. Among multinationals headquartered in the UK, it is claimed that BP’s corporate tax bill would increase at that rate by €484.9m, Barclays by €911m a year and HSBC’s by €4.2bn. The estimates will be published on Tuesday by a new independent research organisation, the EU Tax Observatory, which models the “tax deficit” of multinationals, defined as the difference between current tax payments and the sums due if global profits were subject to the same rate wherever they are booked. Under Biden’s proposal, multinational corporations would be prevented from shifting profits across borders to exploit the most attractive low-tax locations as their profits would be taxed at a minimum global corporation tax rate either where they are booked or headquartered. The Biden administration initially proposed a rate of 21% but last week revised the target down, saying it should be “at least” 15%, although this is regarded by the White House as a “floor” and that discussions should continue to push that rate higher. The UK chancellor, Rushi Sunak, is understood to be skeptical about higher levels mooted for a minimum corporate tax rate while expressing support for the principle. The Treasury has said they have concerns that the policy could lead to economic activity in the UK being taxed elsewhere. The UK has the lowest corporate tax rate in the G7 at 19% although it will rise to 25% by April 2023. Kamala Harris, who was tapped today to lead the administration’s efforts to protect voting rights, has released a statement endorsing the Democrats’ The For the People Act and John Lewis Voting Rights Act. “In the last election, more people voted than ever before. Since then, more than 380 bills have been introduced across the country that would make it harder for Americans to vote,” she said. These bills seek to restrict the options that make voting more convenient and accessible, including early voting and vote by mail.” Harris and Joe Biden have long endorsed the Democrats’ two major voting rights bills – which face a steep road ahead. In the Senate, Republicans and some moderate Democrats like Joe Manchin of West Virginia have opposed the For the People Act. Manchin called it “too darn broad” and partisan. He, Arizona’s Kyrsten Sinema and other Democrats have also resisted their colleague’s efforts to pass the bill by gutting the filibuster, a procedural obstacle that prevents most bills that don’t have the support of at least 60 senators from ever getting a vote. It’s unclear what, if anything, Harris could do to change these realities. Having served in the Senate for four years, she has some ties in the chamber. But Biden, who served in the chamber for nine times has long, is thought to have much deeper relationships with Senators – and has been unable to win them over. “I will work with voting rights organizations, community organizations, and the private sector to help strengthen and uplift efforts on voting rights nationwide,” Harris said. “And we will also work with members of Congress to help advance these bills.” Harris has also been tasked with diplomatic efforts in the Northern Triangle, leading the efforts to expand broadband internet and other issues. Biden closed out his speech in Oklahoma this afternoon by comparing white supremacist atrocities in the past, such as the Tulsa massacre, to extremist threats today. “We must address what remains the stain on the soul of America. What happened in Greenwood was an act of hate and an act of domestic terrorism, with a through-line that exists today, still,” he said. “Remember what you saw in Charlottesville four years ago, on television, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, the KKK [Ku Klux Klan], coming out of those fields at night in Virginia, their lighted torches, the veins bulging as they were screaming.” “Well, [massacre survivor] Mother Fletcher said that when she saw the insurrection at the Capitol on January 6, it broke her heart,” he continued: “A mob of violent white extremists, thugs, said it reminded her of what happened here, 100 years ago, in Greenwood. Look around at the various hate crimes against Asian Americans and Jewish Americans, hate that never goes away.” Someone from the audience called out “that’s true”. Biden went on: “And given a little bit of oxygen by its leaders it comes out from under the rock like it was happening again, as if it never went away.” “We can’t give hate a safe harbor. According to the intelligence community, terrorism from white supremacy is the most lethal threat to the homeland today,” he said. The Biden administration has suspended oil and gas leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge that were issued in the final days of Donald Trump’s presidency. Just two weeks before Biden was inaugurated, the Trump administration had actioned the right to drill in the expansive, delicate tundra that is home to migrating waterfowl, denning polar bears and herds of Porcupine caribou. The move drew fierce opposition from Alaska Native activists and environmental groups – who lobbied Biden to quickly claw back the 1.5m acre of the refuge that has been opened up to fossil fuel production. Here’s more background on the Trump administration’s move: Joe Biden’s speech in Tulsa has now concluded, and that’s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here’s where the day stands so far: Biden delivered remarks in Tulsa to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the city’s race massacre. The president emphasized the importance of acknowledging the lives and livelihoods lost in the massacre, which resulted in the death of at least 300 African Americans and the destruction of 35 blocks of Black real estate. “For much too long, the history of what took place here was told in silence, cloaked in darkness,” Biden said. “My fellow Americans, this was not a riot, this was a massacre.” Biden met with the three living survivors of the massacre before delivering his speech. All three survivors – Viola “Mother” Fletcher, Hughes “Uncle Red” Van Ellis and Lessie “Mother Randle” Benningfield Randle – are over 100 years old. Biden acknowledged them in his remarks, saying, “Now your story will be known in full view.” Ahead of the trip, the Biden administration announced a series of initiatives aimed at narrowing the country’s racial wealth gap. The administration pledged to take action to address racial housing discrimination and use its purchasing power to direct an additional $100bn to small disadvantaged business owners. Biden will meet tomorrow with Republican Senator Shelley Moore Capito to discuss a potential compromise on infrastructure. The meeting comes a week after Republicans outlined their latest offer, which called for spending $928bn on infrastructure over the next eight years, far less than what Biden has proposed. Biden issued a proclamation to mark the start of LGBTQ+ Pride Month. “This Pride Month, we recognize the valuable contributions of LGBTQ+ individuals across America, and we reaffirm our commitment to standing in solidarity with LGBTQ+ Americans in their ongoing struggle against discrimination and injustice,” the president said in his proclamation. Maanvi will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Joe Biden has just announced that he will tap Kamala Harris to lead the administration’s efforts to strengthen national voting rights. Biden described the recent Republican efforts in dozens of states to limit access to the ballot box as “un-American”. The president pledged he would “fight like heck with every tool at my disposal” to pass the For the People Act, Democrats’ expansive election reform bill, and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. Biden also appeared to criticize two moderate Senate Democrats, Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, referencing “two members of the Senate who vote more with my Republican friends”. Manchin has said he opposes the For the People Act. Joe Biden underscored the importance of recognizing the devastating impact that the Tulsa race massacre had on Black lives and livelihoods. At least 300 African Americans were killed in the 1921 massacre, and about 35 blocks of Black real estate in the Greenwood neighborhood were destroyed. “For much too long, the history of what took place here was told in silence, cloaked in darkness,” Biden said. “But just because history is silent it doesn’t mean that it did not take place. While darkness can hide much, it erases nothing.” The president added, “My fellow Americans, this was not a riot, this was a massacre.” Joe Biden noted that he is the first US president to ever visit Tulsa to commemorate the anniversary of the 1921 race massacre that killed at least three hundred African Americans. “The events we speak of today took place 100 years ago – and yet I’m the first president in 100 years ever to come to Tulsa,” Biden said, emphasizing the need to “acknowledge the truth of what took place here”. The president specifically acknowledged the three living massacre survivors with whom he met today – Viola “Mother” Fletcher, Hughes “Uncle Red” Van Ellis and Lessie “Mother Randle” Benningfield Randle. “You are the three known remaining survivors of a story seen in the mirror dimly – but no longer,” Biden said. “Now your story will be known in full view.” Joe Biden is now delivering remarks on the 100th anniversary of the 1921 race massacre in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Before launching into his prepared remarks, the president walked into the audience to speak to two young girls sitting toward the front of the crowd. Returning to the mic, Biden explained, “I just had to make sure the two girls got ice cream when this is over.” Joe Biden will soon deliver remarks at the Greenwood Cultural Center in Tulsa, Oklahoma, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the city’s race massacre. According to a White House pool report, there are about 200 people in attendance for Biden’s speech, including civil rights leaders Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton. The speech comes immediately after Biden met with the three living survivors of the massacre – Viola “Mother” Fletcher, Hughes “Uncle Red” Van Ellis and Lessie “Mother Randle” Benningfield Randle – all of whom are over 100 years old. Joe Biden is now meeting with the three living survivors of the Tulsa race massacre, according to the latest White House pool report. Those survivors are Viola “Mother” Fletcher, Hughes “Uncle Red” Van Ellis and Lessie “Mother Randle” Benningfield Randle. They are all between the ages of 101 and 107. The three survivors testified two weeks ago at a House subcommittee hearing on the need to financially compensate massacre survivors and their descendants. “I will never forget the violence of the white mob when we left our home,” Fletcher told House members. “I still see Black men being shot, Black bodies lying in the street. I still smell smoke and see fire. I still see Black businesses being burned. I still hear airplanes flying overhead. I hear the screams. I have lived through the massacre every day.” It is one of the extraordinary elements of the 1921 catastrophe that survivors are still alive. Three individuals are active today who as children experienced the horror of white sadism perpetrated on that day. The oldest of the trio, Mother Viola Fletcher, just turned 107. At a recent event in Tulsa, she walked unassisted to the podium and recalled what happened to her as a seven-year-old girl. “I still remember all the shooting and running,” she said. “People being killed. Crawling and seeing smoke. Seeing airplanes flying, and a messenger going through the neighbourhood telling all the Black people to leave town.” Then Fletcher stopped speaking. Even after 100 years, the memories of that day still have the power to overwhelm her. Joe Biden is now touring an exhibit on the 1921 race massacre at the Greenwood Cultural Center in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The president will soon deliver remarks at the center to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the massacre, which killed at least 300 African Americans. In his remarks in Tulsa this afternoon, Joe Biden is expected to formally unveil a new set of initiatives aimed at narrowing the racial wealth gap in America. But the policies, which the White House announced this morning, are already attracting some criticism from the NAACP. The Washington Post reports: Biden’s proposals drew immediate criticism from the nation’s most prominent civil rights group, the NAACP, whose leader said the president’s plan omitted canceling student debt, one of the most effective ways to shrink the wealth gap, according to some researchers. ‘Components of the plan are encouraging, but it fails to address the student loan debt crisis that disproportionately affects African Americans,’ said Derrick Johnson, president of the NAACP. ‘You cannot begin to address the racial wealth gap without addressing the student loan debt crisis.’ Although he applauded Biden’s focus on homeownership as a way to build wealth, Johnson pointed out that many African Americans simply won’t qualify for needed loans because of a high debt-to-income ratio. That’s particularly true, he said, among government workers. ‘That must be addressed if there is going to be a question of dealing with the racial wealth gap,’ Johnson said. He supports cutting as much as $50,000 per person in student debt but said it is not a ‘magic number.’ Joe Biden has arrived in Tulsa, Oklahoma, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the city’s race massacre. The president is accompanied on the trip by housing and urban development secretary Marcia Fudge, domestic policy adviser Susan Rice and senior adviser Cedric Richmond. The president will first tour the Greenwood Cultural Center, which is dedicated to honoring the hundreds of African Americans who died in the massacre. Biden will later deliver remarks on the massacre, and he is expected to formally unveil a series of new initiatives that his administration is launching to narrow the racial wealth gap in the country. The White House has also said Biden will meet with survivors of the massacre, three of whom testified before Congress two weeks ago. Florida Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried has officially filed paperwork to run for governor next year. The filing follows months of speculation that Fried, currently the only Florida Democrat serving in a statewide office, would jump into the race to unseat Republican incumbent Ron DeSantis. “I’m here to break the rigged system in Florida,” Fried said in a video announcing her candidacy. “It’s corrupt, it’s anti-democratic, and it’s time for something new.” Fried will have some competition for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, as congressman Charlie Crist has already announced his campaign. Democratic state Senator Annette Taddeo is also considering launching a bid. Whoever wins the Democratic primary race will have to run against DeSantis, who has positioned himself as a potential successor to Donald Trump in the Republican party. Fried has repeatedly criticized DeSantis over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and has called for an FBI investigation into allegations that the governor gave early vaccine access to some of his donors. In case you missed it this morning: Joe Biden issued a proclamation to mark the beginning of LGBTQ+ Pride Month. “This Pride Month, we recognize the valuable contributions of LGBTQ+ individuals across America, and we reaffirm our commitment to standing in solidarity with LGBTQ+ Americans in their ongoing struggle against discrimination and injustice,” the president said in his proclamation. Biden touted the level of LGBTQ+ representation in his administration, saying, “Nearly 14 percent of my 1,500 agency appointees identify as LGBTQ+, and I am particularly honored by the service of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, the first openly LGBTQ+ person to serve in the Cabinet, and Assistant Health Secretary Dr. Rachel Levine, the first openly transgender person to be confirmed by the Senate.” The president noted the LGBTQ+ community has achieved “remarkable progress” since the Stonewall Inn riots of June 1969, but he also emphasized that much work still needs to be done to ensure equal rights for LGBTQ+ Americans. He specifically mentioned the recent wave of state bills aimed at restricting trans students’ participating in school athletics. “During LGBTQ+ Pride Month, we recognize the resilience and determination of the many individuals who are fighting to live freely and authentically. In doing so, they are opening hearts and minds, and laying the foundation for a more just and equitable America,” Biden said. “This Pride Month, we affirm our obligation to uphold the dignity of all people, and dedicate ourselves to protecting the most vulnerable among us.” Joe Biden will soon become the first sitting US president to visit the site of the white supremacist race massacre in Tulsa 100 years ago. There’s been a press huddle aboard Air Force One en route to Oklahoma, where Biden plans to meet with the last survivors of the massacre and announce new investment in Greenwood, the area of Tulsa that was razed by a white mob in 1921, and communities like it where majority-Black populations endure entrenched disadvantage in business, work and housing as a result of racial discrimination. Reuters reports: “What these survivors have endured is tragic and devastating,” White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on the flight to Oklahoma on Tuesday. He plans to listen, learn and portray his heartfelt gratitude to them for sharing their stories, she said. The president will address the U.S. legacy of racist violence, and the challenges to unity ahead, an administration official said. Biden cannot fulfill his promise to restore the “soul” of the nation without recognizing the complexity of U.S. history, the official said. In a proclamation on Monday, Biden asked all Americans to “reflect on the deep roots of racial terror in our Nation and recommit to the work of rooting out systemic racism across our country.” His visit comes during a racial reckoning in the United States as the country’s white majority shrinks, threats increase from white supremacist groups and the country re-examines its treatment of African Americans after last year’s murder of George Floyd, a Black man, by a white Minneapolis police officer, which sparked nationwide protests. Biden, who won the presidency on the strength of Black voter support, made fighting racial inequality a key platform of his 2020 campaign and has done the same during his short tenure in the White House. The Republican governor of Florida, Ron DsSantis, has fired off another shot in the culture war by signing a bill banning transgender females from girls’ sports in schools. “In Florida, girls are going to play girls sports and boys are going to play boys sports,” DeSantis said, signing the bill into law at a Christian academy in Jacksonville on Tuesday. “We’re going to make sure that that’s the reality.” As the AP reports: The new law inflames an already contentious discussion as Republican-controlled states move to limit the rights of LGBTQ people. It also could impose severe financial consequences on Florida. The NCAA, which oversees college athletics, has threatened to relocate key games from states that discriminate against athletes. When the Florida legislature was considering the measure in April, the NCAA said it would commit championship games to “locations where hosts can commit to providing an environment that is safe, healthy and free of discrimination”. The measure approved by the GOP-led legislature takes effect 1 July. Human Rights Campaign president Alphonso David said: “All Floridians will have to face the consequences of this anti-transgender legislation - including economic harm, expensive taxpayer-funded legal battles and a tarnished reputation.” Democrats and LGBTQ advocates said the law will be challenged in court. “This is yet another hate-driven attack from the governor and Republican legislators, and it’s insulting that they’ve staged this morning’s photo-op on the first day of Pride Month,” said state senator Shevrin Jones. “At the end of the day, transgender kids are just kids.” The Florida law mirrors an Idaho law, the first of its kind when enacted last year, that is now mired in legal challenges. Republican governors in Arkansas, Mississippi and Tennessee recently signed similar measures. Here’s where the day stands so far: Joe Biden is en route to Tulsa, Oklahoma, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the city’s race massacre. The president will deliver remarks to honor the victims of the massacre and meet with survivors of the violence, which killed at least 300 African Americans in 1921. Ahead of the trip, the Biden administration announced a series of initiatives aimed at narrowing the country’s racial wealth gap. The administration pledged to take action to address racial housing discrimination and use its purchasing power to direct an additional $100 billion to small disadvantaged business owners. Biden will meet tomorrow with Republican Senator Shelley Moore Capito to discuss a potential compromise on infrastructure. The meeting comes a week after Republicans outlined their latest offer, which called for spending $928 billion on infrastructure over the next eight years, far less than what Biden has proposed. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. The Fox News host Sean Hannity was criticised for appearing at a Donald Trump rally in 2018 but according to a new book he was involved again with Trump’s campaign in 2020, helping write an ad that aired on his primetime show. Frankly, We Did Win This Election: The Inside Story of How Trump Lost, by Mike Bender, senior White House reporter for the Wall Street Journal, will be published in August. News of its contents, including “some amazingly hilarious revelations” about Mike Pence, Rudy Giuliani, Roger Stone, Tucker Carlson, Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump “and the rest of the Trump posse”, was reported by Punchbowl News. According to the news site, the ad known to Trump insiders as “the Hannity ad” and “the one Hannity wrote” ran only during Hannity’s show. An anonymous Trump aide is reported as saying “Hannity said this is our best spot yet” but Bender reports: “Inside the campaign, the spot was mocked mercilessly – mostly because of the dramatic, over-the-top language and a message that seemed to value quantity over quality. “Donald Trump himself, in a post-election interview with Bender, did not dispute that Hannity wrote the ad, which called [Joe] Biden a ‘47-year swamp creature’ who had ‘accomplished nothing’ and supported a ‘radical, socialist Green New Deal’.” Hannity denied writing the ad, telling Bender: “The world knows that Sean Hannity supports Donald Trump. But my involvement specifically in the campaign – no. I was not involved that much. Anybody who said that is full of shit.” Joe Biden is now en route to Tulsa, Oklahoma, where he will commemorate the 100th anniversary of the city’s race massacre. The president did not stop to take questions from reporters as he boarded Air Force One for the trip to Tulsa, where he will meet with massacre survivors and deliver remarks to honor the victims of the violence. The Washington Post has obtained more than 800 pages of emails to and from Anthony Fauci, the senior US health official who is now chief medical adviser to President Joe Biden, during the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic last year. The paper reports that the emails offer a window into the chaos, panic and confusion of the time, and of the considerable difficulties Fauci faced as a prominent figure in a Covid task force serving Donald Trump. As Fauci recently told the Post, “I was getting every single kind of question, mostly people who were a little bit confused about the mixed messages that were coming out of the White House and wanted to know what’s the real scoop. “I have a reputation that I respond to people when they ask for help, even if it takes a long time. And it’s very time consuming, but I do.” The Post obtained the emails through the Freedom of Information Act. Some exchanges are with George Gao, a top Chinese health official. “Lets work together to get the virus out of the earth,” Gao says in one message. “We will get through this together,” Fauci replies. US-China tensions have been high throughout the pandemic but the US is now investigating whether the virus, discovered in Wuhan province, came from animals, as has been the scientific community’s position for some time, or whether there is truth to the theory that the virus was being studied in a laboratory and escaped. In a column for the Guardian on Tuesday, the author Thomas Frank said that if true, the laboratory leak theory “is the kind of thing that could obliterate the faith of millions” of Americans who have followed government advice throughout the pandemic. In another exchange between Fauci and Gao, the Chinese official refers to “some news (hope it is fake) that [you] are being attacked by some people. Hope you are well under such [an] irrational situation”. “Thank you for your kind note,” Fauci replies. “All is well despite some crazy people in this world.” Fauci was often at odds with Trump and others who sought to play down the severity of the threat to US public health. The scientist ended up having to hire security. Here’s our own interview with Fauci, published yesterday: Joe Biden is “finishing the job” begun by Barack Obama, the former president told the New York Times in an interview released on Tuesday. “I think that what we’re seeing now, is Joe and the administration are essentially finishing the job,” Obama said. “And I think it’ll be an interesting test. “Ninety per cent of the folks who were there in my administration, they are continuing and building on the policies we talked about, whether it’s the Affordable Care Act or our climate change agenda and the Paris [climate deal], and figuring out how do we improve the ladders to mobility through things like community colleges.” Obama also mused about Biden’s much-discussed ability to reach voters, particularly in post-industrial midwestern states, who voted Obama then switched to Donald Trump. “By virtue of biography and generationally,” Obama said, his vice-president, who is 78 and was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, “can still reach some of those folks”. “People knew I was left on issues like race, or gender equality, and LGBTQ issues and so forth,” Obama said. “But I think maybe the reason I was successful campaigning in downstate Illinois, or Iowa, or places like that is they never felt as if I was condemning them for not having gotten to the politically correct answer quick enough, or that somehow they were morally suspect because they had grown up with and believed more traditional values.” In fact Obama famously stirred controversy in 2008 when he said such voters “get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren’t like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations”. The New York Times interviewer did not raise those remarks. Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell once again defended Republicans’ decision to block the bill to create a bipartisan commission to study the January 6 insurrection. “I don’t think anybody’s going to get away with anything,” the Republican leader said in Kentucky today. “I think we’ll know everything we need to know. We were all witnesses, we were right there when it happened. And I simply think the commission is not necessary.” McConnell’s comments come four days after Senate Republicans blocked the commission bill from being taken up for debate, killing the legislation for now. Six Republicans joined their Democratic colleagues in voting to advance the bill, but Democrats needed 10 Republican votes to overcome a filibuster of the legislation. Alexandra Villareal reports for the Guardian: Republicans in Texas are already plotting to resurrect their fight for sweeping voting restrictions after Democratic lawmakers walked out of the state capitol and blocked an 11th-hour attempt to ram through legislation that would have made it harder to cast a ballot. The Texas governor, Greg Abbott – who leads the state’s domineering Republican majority – has announced he will include the high-stakes issue on his agenda when he reconvenes the legislature for a rapid-fire special session. He called the failure of the bill “deeply disappointing”. Abbott, who says “election integrity” remains an emergency in Texas, wields control over what is essentially legislative overtime, where lawmakers consider issues on a sped-up timeline. When the session will begin remains unclear. But advocates are still painting last night’s historic show of force as an inflection point for the Texas legislature and America, when Democrats shirked business as usual for aggressive tactics that matched the urgency of a teetering democracy. “The fight you saw last night is the fight that will remain and continue,” state representative Trey Martinez Fischer, a Democrat representing San Antonio, told the Guardian. “That’s our commitment.” Joe Biden’s visit to Tulsa comes almost exactly one year after Donald Trump traveled to the city to hold his first campaign rally since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, an event that sparked intense criticism and attracted protests. The AP notes: After suspending his campaign rallies because of the coronavirus pandemic, Trump, a Republican, chose Tulsa as the place to mark his return. But his decision to schedule the rally on June 19, the holiday known as Juneteenth that commemorates the end of slavery in the United States, was met with such fierce criticism that he postponed the event by a day. The rally was still marked by protests outside and empty seats inside an arena downtown. Trump arrived in Tulsa during a highly charged moment, days after he had ordered the forcible clearing of Lafayette Square across from the White House, with federal officers pushing out those peacefully protesting [George] Floyd’s death. Trump reflexively embraced law enforcement throughout his presidency and was frequently accused of using racist rhetoric when painting apocalyptic — and inaccurate — scenes of American cities. While in Oklahoma today, Joe Biden will meet with survivors of the Tulsa race massacre and visit the Greenwood Cultural Center. The center describes itself as “the keeper of the flame for the Black Wall Street era, the events known as the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, and the astounding resurgence of the Greenwood District in the months and years following the tragedy”. The Guardian’s Sam Levine reports: Conservative activists across America are pushing efforts to review the 2020 vote more than six months after the election, a move experts say is a dangerous attempt to continue to sow doubt about the results of the 2020 election that strikes at the heart of America’s democratic process. Encouraged by an ongoing haphazard review of 2.1m ballots in Arizona, activists are pushing to review votes or voting equipment in California, Georgia, Michigan, and New Hampshire. Meanwhile, in Wisconsin, the powerful speaker of the state house of representatives recently hired ex-law enforcement officers, including one with a history of supporting Republicans, to spend the next three months investigating claims of fraud. At least one of the officers hired has a history of supporting GOP claims. The announcement also came after state officials announced they found just 27 cases of potential fraud in 2020 out of 3.3m votes cast. The reviews are not going to change the 2020 election results or find widespread fraud, which is exceedingly rare. Nonetheless, the conservative activists behind the effort – many of whom have little election experience – have championed the reviews as an attempt to assuage concerns the 2020 election was stolen. If the probes don’t turn up anything, they will only serve to increase confidence in elections, proponents say. Joe Biden also released a statement yesterday to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Tulsa race massacre, calling on Americans to “recommit” to efforts to address systemic racism in the US. “On this solemn centennial of the Tulsa Race Massacre, I call on the American people to reflect on the deep roots of racial terror in our nation and recommit to the work of rooting out systemic racism across our country,” Biden said in the statement. The president noted that the federal government “must reckon with and acknowledge the role that it has played in stripping wealth and opportunity from Black communities”. The Biden administration announced today a series of initiatives aimed at narrowing the racial wealth gap in the US, including efforts to support affordable housing and minority-owned small businesses. Reflecting on the lives and businesses lost in Tulsa in 1921, Biden said yesterday, “We honor the legacy of the Greenwood community, and of Black Wall Street, by reaffirming our commitment to advance racial justice through the whole of our government, and working to root out systemic racism from our laws, our policies, and our hearts.” The full-page advert in a special Black History edition of USA Today presents a technicolor vision of modern-day Tulsa, with sparkling images of public parks and brightly-painted murals celebrating the local Black community under the banner headline: “Tulsa Triumphs”. “Tulsa is leading America’s journey to racial healing,” the text says, inviting visitors from across the US to sample the delights of Oklahoma’s second-largest city. The enticements include “an emotional opportunity for learning and reflection” and a “space for reconciliation… Tulsa triumphs, and you can be a part of this pilgrimage.” The advert is a brazen attempt to turn Tulsa’s grim distinction as the setting of one of the most grotesque mass lynchings in US history into a tourist draw. It is the work of the Tulsa Race Massacre Centennial Commission, a body of prominent state and city politicians and other local notables who have put together the city’s established version of the 100th anniversary of a very special day. On that day, 31 May 1921, white Tulsans ran amok, shooting any Black person in sight, dropping incendiary devices from the air onto their homes and burning to the ground one of the most flourishing Black business districts in the country, known as “Black Wall Street”. Some 35 blocks of Black real estate in the Greenwood neighbourhood were destroyed. At least 300 men, women and children were murdered. Over 24 hours, Tulsa witnessed what is thought to be the worst single event of white supremacist violence against African Americans in the nation’s history. From the terror of 31 May 1921 to the “triumph” of 31 May 2021 – it makes for a powerful attraction for visitors. The only hitch with this depiction of Tulsa rising from the ashes is that from the perspective of the Black survivors and many of the descendants of the massacre, it has no bearing in reality. Ahead of Joe Biden’s Tulsa trip, his administration also outlined how his American Jobs Plan will directly benefit communities of color. The president’s proposal includes a $10 billion community revitalization fund that will help fund community-led infrastructure projects and a $15 billion grant program to bolster transportation infrastructure. Biden has also called for the creation of a Neighborhood Homes Tax Credit to support the development of affordable housing and a $5 billion grant program to expand housing options for Americans with low or moderate incomes. Finally, the president has indicated he would like to invest $31 billion to expand efforts to support minority-owned small businesses. However, it is very unclear if any of these initiatives will make it into the final version of the infrastructure bill. Senate Republicans have proposed a $257 billion bill, much smaller than the $1.7 trillion infrastructure package that Biden is pushing, and it’s possible that proposals like those above may end up getting cut from the legislation. The White House has just confirmed Biden will meet with Republican Senator Shelley Moore Capito to discuss her team’s latest offer. That meeting will likely offer insight into the size and scope of the final bill. Greetings from Washington, live blog readers. Joe Biden will travel today to Tulsa, Oklahoma, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the city’s race massacre, which targeted affluent African Americans and their businesses. Ahead of the president’s trip, the White House announced this morning a series of new initiatives aimed at narrowing the country’s racial wealth gap. The administration pledged to take action to address racial housing discrimination and use its purchasing power to direct an additional $100 Billion to small disadvantaged business owners. The trip and the administration’s announcement come two weeks after three living survivors of the massacre -- Viola Fletcher, Hughes Van Ellis and Lessie Evelyn Benningfield Randle -- testified to Congress about the need to compensate massacre survivors and their descendants. “I am here seeking justice,” Fletcher said at the House subcommittee hearing. “I am here asking my country to acknowledge what happened in Tulsa in 1921.” The blog will have more details on the trip coming up, so stay tuned.","charCount":"39724","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/maanvi-singh\">Maanvi Singh</a> (now) and <a href=\"profile/joan-greve\">Joan E Greve</a> (earlier)"},{"headline":"‘No political story allowed’: Hong Kong broadcaster falls silent on sensitive subjects","standfirst":"<p>Employees at public broadcaster RTHK voice fears for future amid gradual erosion of media freedoms </p>","trailText":"Employees at public broadcaster RTHK voice fears for future amid gradual erosion of media freedoms ","byline":"Helen Davidson in Taipei","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1d139a81f5cff143203af5c791de23e5ea5cd19a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d139a81f5cff143203af5c791de23e5ea5cd19a/0_332_5000_3001/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People gather at Hong Kong’s Victoria Park in 2020 to mark the Tiananmen Square protests.

Beyond a 1.5C rise, many species will face increasing problems finding food or surviving, according to a report from WWF on the effects of climate breakdown on 12 key species across the world. In the UK, puffins are facing increasing threats from warming seas. Sandeels form a large part of the seabird’s diet, and the sandeels depend on crustaceans called copepods. Now, however, warming seas mean copepods are blooming before the sandeels hatch. As the sandeels miss out on their meals, there are fewer for puffins to catch, and entire colonies can fail as a result. WWF found that between 2000 and 2016, copepods were blooming nearly 20 days earlier than sandeel larvae were hatching, a mismatch likely to widen at higher temperatures. The report found that the effects of global heating, which has already reached more than 1C above pre-industrial levels, could already be seen in the UK. For instance, mountain hares in the Highlands of Scotland grow white coats for camouflage in winter, but the snow is melting earlier, before their coats have returned to brown, leaving them exposed to predators. While warming of 0.5C above current levels may seem small, the report found the effects would be harmful to a wide variety of species, including snow leopards, hippos, monkeys and frogs, sea turtles and coral. Leatherback turtles are sensitive to even slight changes in temperature, as the sex of the turtle is determined while the egg incubates in the sand – hotter sand means more females and not enough males, and can mean eggs fail to hatch at all. The report also examined the fate of the black-headed squirrel monkey of the Amazon, which lives in a flood plain, so a single large flooding event – of the kind forecast to become more frequent at 1.5C – could wipe out the whole population. Commercial interests around the world will also be threatened if temperatures rise above 1.5C, with coffee plantations vulnerable to rising temperatures – nearly 90% of arabica coffee plantations in South America could become unsuitable for the crop by 2050. Mike Barrett, the executive director of science and conservation at WWF, said the climate crisis was adding to a huge loss of wildlife: global wildlife populations have already plummeted by 68% since 1970. “Nature is our life support system, and its continued destruction is not only devastating local wildlife and communities, but creating a hotter, less stable planet, putting our very survival at risk,” he said. “This isn’t a far-off threat: the impacts of climate change are already being felt and if we don’t act now to keep global warming to 1.5C we will slider faster and faster towards catastrophe.” WWF also found that protecting vital habitats would be essential to stop warming exceeding 1.5C. The more landscapes are denuded of vegetation and their complex ecologies, the faster the climate crisis is likely to take hold.

The Home Office said the call for evidence would help to better understand the scale of the problem, the criminal justice system’s response to it and the impact that such incidents have on the industry. The National Action Plan for the Safety of Journalists in the UK was formed after the government received reports of journalists facing abuse and attacks while going about their daily work – including being “punched, threatened with knives, forcibly detained, and subjected to rape and death threats” – and hopes to implement measures to tackle the problem. The Home Office has pledged more training for police officers and said it would seek commitments from social media companies and prosecutors to take tougher action against perpetrators. The national action plan held its first meeting last July and has representatives from government, journalism, policing, prosecution services and civil society, including the minister for safeguarding, Victoria Atkins. She said: “Journalists play a vital role in our democracy and should be free to do their jobs without fear of abuse, violence and intimidation. “Threats, including via social media, can have a devastating impact on mental and physical health and affect a journalist’s ability to report important stories for us all. “This is unacceptable and I encourage members of the media to come forward and report their experiences so we can better understand the scale of the problem and protect them from harm.” The consultation comes after a spate of incidents in which reporters have been subjected to abuse. Last week a man was given a hospital order after telling a camera crew he would “shoot everyone at the BBC” because they were “linked to satanic child abuse”. Russell Rawlingson, 52, verbally abused journalist Sima Kotecha and her colleagues in May last year shortly before she was due to broadcast live from Leicester city centre. He was sent to a medium secure hospital under section 37 of the Mental Health Act for harassing the journalist, as well as separate matters of having a bladed article in a public place, assaulting an emergency worker and using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intent to cause fear or provoke violence. Leicester crown court heard Rawlingson has bipolar affective disorder which requires daily medication. In March, Tommy Robinson was handed a temporary stalking prevention order against the Independent’s home affairs correspondent, Lizzie Dearden, and her boyfriend, Samuel Partridge. The English Defence League founder threatened to falsely accuse Partridge of being a paedophile in a bid to squash a negative story about him, a court heard. The court also heard Robinson went to their home in south-east London on 17 January, days after a request for comment through his solicitors’ firm about a story alleging he misused money donated by his supporters. Media minister John Whittingdale said: “Every time a journalist is abused, either online or offline, it is an attack not just on the individual but also on our society, which needs reliable and fact-based reporting more than ever. “We want to hear from any member of the media who has ever felt unsafe doing their job so we can give those who play such a vital role in democracy the respect and protection they deserve.” Evidence can be submitted from 12.15am on Wednesday.","charCount":"3514","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/nadeembadshah\">Nadeem Badshah</a>"},{"headline":"Pupils to be offered 100m hours of tuition in Covid catch-up plan","standfirst":"<p>Government’s £1.4bn programme of tutoring courses won’t be enough, warns its education recovery tsar</p>","trailText":"Government’s £1.4bn programme of tutoring courses won’t be enough, warns its education recovery tsar","byline":"Peter Walker and Rachel Hall","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"56d4fb84fe65aebaae83e26c12216685dfc0be2c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/56d4fb84fe65aebaae83e26c12216685dfc0be2c/0_167_5128_3078/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Teenage student with tutor.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The money will be spent on 6m sets of tutoring courses for disadvantaged pupils and an expansion of help for 16- to 19-year-olds.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Parker Lee/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p><strong><br></strong>Pupils will be offered an extra 100m hours of tuition under post-pandemic catch-up plans unveiled today – but the government faced immediate criticism of the £1.4bn programme, with its own tsar warning “more will be needed”.</p> <p>After months of unprecedented school closures, £1.4bn will be spent on up to 6m sets of 15-hour tutoring courses for disadvantaged pupils as well as an expansion of an existing fund for helping 16- to 19-year-olds with subjects such as English and maths, the Department for Education (DfE) said.</p> <p>There is also provision for extra training and support for teachers, and funding to allow some year-13 students to repeat their final year if it was badly affected by the pandemic.</p> <p>It gave no immediate verdict on mooted plans to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/jun/01/school-day-in-england-could-be-extended-in-covid-catch-up-proposals\">extend schools days</a> by 30 minutes.

After months of unprecedented school closures, £1.4bn will be spent on up to 6m sets of 15-hour tutoring courses for disadvantaged pupils as well as an expansion of an existing fund for helping 16- to 19-year-olds with subjects such as English and maths, the Department for Education (DfE) said. There is also provision for extra training and support for teachers, and funding to allow some year-13 students to repeat their final year if it was badly affected by the pandemic. It gave no immediate verdict on mooted plans to extend schools days by 30 minutes. This idea, criticised as misplaced by some teaching unions, will be the subject of a separate review due to report later in the year. On the new spending plans there was virtual unanimity from unions that the sums committed were insufficient, with the National Education Union calling them “inadequate and incomplete”. Perhaps even more damaging for ministers, the announced spend is about a tenth of the £15bn total understood to have been recommended by Sir Kevan Collins, who was appointed in February by Downing Street as the education recovery commissioner tasked with leading efforts to make up for the damage done by the coronavirus pandemic, particularly to pupils from more deprived backgrounds. The official announcement of the new plan carried laudatory quotes from Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, and Boris Johnson, the prime minister, who said it “should give parents confidence” – but the quote released from Collins was more circumspect. Ensuring all pupils would catch up “will require a sustained and comprehensive programme of support”, Collins said, and while the latest announcement would help many children and teachers, “more will be needed to meet the scale of the challenge”. Government sources stress that the total announced for all catch-up work over the past 12 months is now closer to £3bn and that ministers have pledged to implement a long-term plan for the process. Mary Bousted, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “Rarely has so much been promised and so little delivered.” The amount promised showed that the government “does not understand, nor does it appreciate, the essential foundation laid by education for the nation’s economic recovery”, she added. The National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) called the investment “paltry” when compared with plans in other countries and with the amount spent on supporting businesses. “After weeks of talking big and building expectation for education recovery, this announcement only confirms the government’s lack of ambition for education. It’s a damp squib,” said Paul Whiteman, the NAHT’s general secretary. “Education recovery cannot be done on the cheap.” The Association of School and College Leaders condemned what it called “a hugely disappointing announcement which lets down the nation’s children and schools at a time when the government needed to step up and demonstrate its commitment to education”.Ideas for extending the school day could prove controversial if implemented, as reportedly recommended in Collins’s report to ministers. Polling has shown it is not hugely popular with parents, while unions have warned about the impact on family time and out-of-school activities. Of the government’s tutoring plans, an extra £218m will go towards the national tutoring programme, which provides external support, with £222m for tutoring for those aged 16 to 19. The biggest chunk, £579m, will be for “local tutoring” – in-school services using new or existing staff. This will cover about 75% of the total costs, with schools contributing the rest. In the coming academic years, the proportion paid by schools will rise so that they eventually meet most of the tutoring costs, the DfE statement said. Labour at the same time unveiled its party plan for educational recovery, pledging an extra £14.7bn over the next two years to ensure pupils catch up and to reduce extra attainment gaps created by the disruption. Particularly focused on the wellbeing of students following the pandemic, the money would be spent on areas including additional breakfast clubs and activities for children, giving them more time to socialise and better mental health support. The Labour plan would commit to small-group tutoring for any child requiring it, more support for teachers, an “education recovery premium” to guarantee more spending on children who have faced the greatest disruption, and free school meals extended across all holidays. The shadow education secretary, Kate Green, contrasted what she called Labour’s “bold plan” with the commitments made by the government. Speaking of the government’s plan, Green said: “This announcement makes a mockery of the prime minister’s claim that education is a priority. His own education recovery commissioner has all but said this plan is insufficient. Sir Kevan Collins told ministers that 10 times this level of investment was needed to help children recover.” In a statement released with the plans, Johnson said: “Young people have sacrificed so much over the last year and as we build back from the pandemic, we must make sure that no child is left behind. “This next step in our long-term catch-up plan should give parents confidence that we will do everything we can to support children who have fallen behind and that every child will have the skills and knowledge they need to fulfil their potential.”","charCount":"5673","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/peterwalker\">Peter Walker</a> and <a href=\"profile/rachel-hall\">Rachel Hall</a>"},{"headline":"Australian coal burnt overseas creates nearly twice the nation’s domestic emissions","standfirst":"<p>New data comes amid warning that world’s growing awareness of coal exports’ impact risks further damaging Australia’s reputation on climate</p>","trailText":"New data comes amid warning that world’s growing awareness of coal exports’ impact risks further damaging Australia’s reputation on climate","byline":"Graham Readfearn","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7e9a93fa3079499a7f0031990f54483f047c07a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e9a93fa3079499a7f0031990f54483f047c07a9/0_82_4000_2402/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Coal stockpiled in Newcastle\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Coal stockpiled in Newcastle, NSW, the world’s largest coal export port.

Australia and Indonesia were the biggest exporters of coal for making steel and burning in power stations, together accounting for 59% of the world’s seaborne coal market. When countries report their national emissions to the United Nations, only fossil fuels burned domestically are counted. But the impacts of the CO2 on the climate are the same, whether they are burned in Australia or overseas. Earlier this week the government’s latest emissions data showed greenhouse gas emissions had dropped to a 30-year low of 499Mt of CO2e, thanks mostly to the Covid-19 pandemic and increasing amounts of renewable energy replacing coal. But the new data, compiled by the UK-based pro-renewables thinktank Ember, says emissions from Australian coal burned overseas released 895Mt of CO2 into the atmosphere, with 460Mt of that coming from coal used in power stations. Australia has been coming under increasing international and domestic pressure to announce more ambitious climate targets ahead of the next major climate talks in Glasgow in November. At the same time, state governments continue to release and promote more fossil fuel extraction despite an International Energy Agency report warning that new projects need to halt if the world is to have a chance to keep global heating to 1.5C Ember analyst Nicolas Fulghum said that while profits from coal exports flowed to exporting countries, “the environmental impact is shipped overseas”. Eight out of the 10 largest coal ports by volume were in either Australia and Indonesia. Newcastle remains the world’s largest coal export port, with 155Mt – or 12% of all the world’s seaborne coal – coming from the New South Wales hub. Hay Point in Queensland is the second-largest coal port, exporting 100Mt of coal in 2020. Australia’s top three customers for thermal coal in 2020 were Japan (67Mt), China (29Mt) and Korea (28Mt), according to the data. All three countries have pledged to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions – Japan and Korea by 2050 and China by 2060. Bill Hare, the chief executive and senior scientist with Climate Analytics and a veteran of international climate negotiations, told the Guardian the new data was in line with his own consultancy’s research on export emissions. He said the data showed Australia was “highly exposed” to the impacts of planned CO2 cuts in countries currently buying the coal. “That’s an economic risk and a strong signal.” He said that as more people around the world started to understand the impact of Australia’s exports on the global climate, this risked further damaging the country’s already poor reputation on climate action. “This is going to translate into some fundamental questions about Australia’s economy. If we’re so exposed to carbon and the global markets, that’s going to feed into a broader view of Australia’s economy as being underpinned by a reliance on fossil fuels.” He said historically Australia’s fossil fuel export industry was largely ignored during international negotiations because there were many countries that profited from fossil fuels. But he had noticed a shift at the most recent talks in Madrid in 2019 when some national delegates had started to “point fingers” in frustration at major fossil fuel exporters, including Australia. “These sorts of numbers won’t help Australia’s position at all” at the coming talks scheduled for Glasgow, Hare said. Australia has promised to release a long-term greenhouse gas emissions strategy before those talks. Morrison told an April climate summit hosted by the US president, Joe Biden, that future generations would “thank us not for what we have promised but what we deliver”. Morrison has said Australia wants to reach net-zero “as soon as we possibly can” but has resisted pressure to promise a mid-century target. The government has said it is concentrating on a technology-led response to cutting emissions, but has also pushed for a “gas-led recovery” from the economic impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic. Australia’s coal and gas industry has complained to an ongoing parliamentary inquiry that it is finding it harder to gain financial backing and insurance for projects.","charCount":"4329","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/graham-readfearn\">Graham Readfearn</a>"},{"headline":"Coronavirus live

A key quality is that they resist change: they attempt to fix for us an abiding sense of what exactly has happened. They can be many things: columns, tombs, plaques, cenotaphs, village halls, even housing. But who are they for? The people who suffered, their families, the wider public or future generations?</p> <p>At some point, inevitably, there will be an official, national memorial of the pandemic in the UK (as well as many more, surely, at local and international levels). What, then, should it look like? It will have to contend with how messy the past year has been – the death, the sorrow, the fear, but also the ensuing political and social division. Perhaps through all of that, memorialisation can play a therapeutic role.</p> <p>Memorials naturally remove some of the complexity of the past, replacing it with something smoother, better suited to a broad audience: the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/from-the-archive-blog/2020/nov/10/the-funeral-of-the-unknown-warrior-november-920\">tomb of the Unknown Warrior</a> doesn’t address one specific loss, so it can talk of all loss. Because of this universal ambition it is vital public memorials hit the right tone – being both honest and broadly interpretable, tending to avoid friction. As a result, though, memorials can feel as if they don’t talk to you directly or seem too vague. But at a time when narratives are brutally contested, it seems unlikely that a pandemic memorial will avoid controversy, no matter how skilful the architect.</p> <p><strong>Read more here: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/01/what-should-britains-memorial-covid-pandemic-look-like\">Eddie Blake – What should Britain’s memorial to the Covid pandemic look like?</a></strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/01/what-should-britains-memorial-covid-pandemic-look-like\">What should Britain’s memorial to the Covid pandemic look like? | Eddie Blake</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60b5d8288f088d8c3178f3a9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-01T06:49:42.786Z\">7.49am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Prof Adam Finn, from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, is a second expert in the UK on the airwaves today warning against further easing of domestic restrictions on 21 June.

it from the UK blog team, thanks for following our coverage. Victoria in Australia has imposed a seven-day “circuit-breaker lockdown” in response to a growing Covid cluster in Melbourne’s northern suburbs. From 11.59pm Thursday, 27 May until 11.59pm Thursday 3 June, the following rules apply to the entire state of Victoria, not just Melbourne. Authorities in Australia have released a list of public exposure sites in New South Wales visited by a confirmed case of Covid-19. Here are the current coronavirus hotspots, Covid exposure sites, venues and case location alerts and what to do if you’ve visited them. Israel’s health ministry said it found a small number of heart inflammation cases observed mainly in young men who received Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine in Israel that were likely linked to their vaccination, Reuters reports. Pfizer has said it has not observed a higher rate of the condition, known as myocarditis, than would normally be expected in the general population. In Israel, 275 cases of myocarditis were reported between December 2020 and May 2021 among more than 5 million vaccinated people, the ministry said, in disclosing the findings of a study it commissioned to examine the matter. Most patients who experienced heart inflammation spent no more than four days in hospital and 95% of the cases were classified as mild, according to the study, which the ministry said was conducted by three teams of experts. The study found “there is a probable link between receiving the second dose (of Pfizer) vaccine and the appearance of myocarditis among men aged 16 to 30,” it said in a statement. Ecuador this week launched a plan to vaccinate 9 million people against coronavirus in 100 days, part of recently installed President Guillermo Lasso’s plan to revive the economy by battling the pandemic, Reuters reports. Lasso said the government was in talks with Russia over the purchase of some 18 million doses of the Sputnik V vaccine. “All of our logistical effort will be successful once we have vaccines,” Lasso said. “It is urgent, and we depend on the provision of vaccines from abroad.” Ecuador began its inoculation campaign in January, but former President Lenin Moreno’s administration advanced slowly due to logistical issues, allegations of nepotism in the allocation of shots, and frequent changes of top health officials. Brazil registered 2,408 Covid-19 deaths and 78,926 additional cases, according to data released by the country’s health ministry. The South American country has now registered 465,199 total coronavirus deaths and 16,624,480 total confirmed cases, Reuters reports. As Anthony Fauci, the US’s leading infectious diseases official, grappled with the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic last spring, he was pulled in many directions. Donald Trump’s White House, which was downplaying the dangers, was demanding he portray the outbreak on their terms; the media was hungry for answers; and Fauci’s email inbox was constantly full with officials, the public and celebrities offering advice and seeking information about the world’s deadliest health crisis for a century. The US administered 296,404,240 doses of Covid-19 vaccines in the country as of Tuesday morning and distributed 366,317,045 doses, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Those figures are up from the 294,928,850 vaccine doses the CDC said had gone into arms by May 30 out of 366,316,945 doses delivered. The agency said 168,489,729 people had received at least one dose while 135,867,425 people are fully vaccinated. Moderna Inc said it has entered into an agreement with Thermo Fisher Scientific for manufacturing and packaging its Covid-19 vaccine, as the US vaccine maker looks to scale up production, Reuters reports. Under the terms, Moderna said Thermo Fisher’s commercial manufacturing site in Greenville, North Carolina will be used to provide fill/finish manufacturing services and supply packaging for hundreds of millions of doses of the vaccine. “The addition of Thermo Fisher to our network will support our efforts to scale up our manufacturing ability,” Moderna’s chief technical operations and quality officer, Juan Andres, said in a statement. Earlier on Tuesday, Moderna filed for full U.S. approval of its COVID-19 vaccine for adults The UK has reported no deaths from Covid in a day, for the first time in 10 months, raising optimism in Downing Street that England could forge ahead with the final stage of the roadmap despite scientists warning that extra restrictions might be needed to control a third wave. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, hailed the statistic as proof that vaccines were breaking the link between infection and severe illness, though scientists warned against reading too much into the numbers following a bank holiday weekend. India said it is aiming to triple capacity to 10 million jabs per day by July to avert another wave of Covid-19 infections as deadly as the outbreak suffered since April. A Brazilian Supreme Court judge has given president Jair Bolsonaro five days to submit information regarding the government’s decision to host the Copa America football tournament despite the nation’s ongoing struggles with Covid-19. A decrease in local Covid-19 vaccine production has slowed the pace of Brazil’s inoculation drive and contributed to a growing number of people not taking their second doses, according to the latest data from the Fiocruz biomedical institute. Heathrow airport in London has begun processing arrivals from red list countries in a dedicated terminal following concerns about them mixing with other passengers. Travellers arriving from red list nations on direct flights are being taken to Terminal 3. Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa called on faster delivery of vaccines to poorer countries, including by waiving patents on vaccine development. Peru has revised its official Covid-19 death toll to 180,764, nearly triple the previous official figure of 69,342, following a government review that shows the severity of the outbreak in the country. The World Health Organisation has recommended a new set of names for the coronavirus “variants of concern”, which will be known by letters of the Greek alphabet. Alpha is the new name for UK/Kent (B.1.1.7), Beta for South Africa (B.1.351), Gamma for Brazil (P.1) and Delta for the variant first detected in India (B.1.617.2). Malaysia has begun a tough nationwide lockdown to battle a worsening coronavirus outbreak. Of almost 2,800 deaths from Covid-19 recorded in the country of 32 million since the start of the pandemic, over 40 percent were in May alone. Israel announced it will begin phasing out coronavirus-related payments to the unemployed and Ireland announced similar steps later this year while maintaining other income and business supports as the economy fully reopens. The Coachella music festival will return to the US in April 2022 after being repeatedly delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic, organisers have announced. Scotland is entering a “third wave” of coronavirus, according to the national clinical director, as Nicola Sturgeon paused plans to ease Covid restrictions in much of the country. The First Minister insisted the country was still at a “delicate and fragile point” in the battle with the virus, in an announcement on restrictions which she described as a “mixed bag”. Jason Leitch warned the Indian variant “is causing us some challenge and is spreading quicker than we hoped”. When asked by BBC Radio Scotland’s Drivetime if the country was at the start of a third wave he replied: “Yes, I think we are. “The question is how big that third wave is - everybody, every modelling higher education institution... they all said, if you open you will get more cases. “Now I’m not sure I needed a university to tell me that, I think people in the street would have told me that. “The question is, whether you control that to a level that doesn’t cause enough severe disease to fill hospitals, and enough severe disease to cause misery and death to families. “That’s the balance we’re now trying to strike and the advice we’ve given and the decisions the First Minister and the Cabinet have made today.” As part of those decisions the First Minister confirmed Glasgow, which had been under the strictest restrictions in Scotland, will see these relaxed, with the city moving to Level 2 from Saturday, PA reports. On that date, many island communities will move to Level 0 - the lowest level there is under Scotland’s five tier system - while 15 council areas will step down to Level 1. But 13 local authority areas, including Edinburgh, Dundee and Stirling, will remain in Level 2 for the time being. A decrease in local Covid-19 vaccine production has slowed the pace of Brazil’s inoculation drive and contributed to a growing number of people not taking their second doses, according to the latest data from the Fiocruz biomedical institute. Reuters reports: Brazil administered 21 million COVID-19 shots in May, down 14.2% from the 24.5 million vaccines injected in April, according to data compiled by the federally funded Fiocruz and state Health Departments. More than 10.5 million second doses were given in April, compared with 6.6 million last month, the data show. Experts said a lack of shots, coupled with misinformation about vaccines, had led millions of Brazilians to only take one dose so far. A lack of chemical ingredients, mainly delivered from China, has caused Brazil’s two main vaccine production hubs, Fiocruz and the Butantan institute in Sao Paulo, to temporarily pause production of their respective shots. Fiocruz is making the AstraZeneca PLC vaccine, while Butantan is manufacturing a shot developed by China’s Sinovac Biotech Ltd. Carlos Lula, president of the National Council of Health Secretaries (Conass), said about 5 million people had so far not shown up to take their second dose. “Conass is talking to the Health Ministry and seeing what we can do to speed up vaccinations,” he told Reuters. The Coachella music festival will return to the US in April 2022, organisers have announced. The 2020 event was scheduled for April of that year before being pushed to October. It was then moved to April 2021 before again being cancelled due to the health crisis. However promoter Goldenvoice has now confirmed Coachella will return over two weekends next year in California - April 15-17 and April 22-24. Advance ticket sales begin on Friday, organisers added. The Stagecoach music festival, a country music event scheduled for April on the same site as Coachella, is also making its return. It is scheduled to take place over April 29-May 1. New infection control guidance to help keep NHS workers safe from Covid-19 “falls short”, leading nurses in the UK said. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) said that the updated official Covid-19 infection prevention and control guidance “focuses too much on aerosol generating procedures as the main risk”. But doctors have welcomed the new guidance as a “step in the right direction”, PA reports. Concerns were raised early on in the pandemic that medics were not able to get access to appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) amid a worldwide shortage. The guidance, issued jointly by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) as well as public health agencies across the UK’s four nations and NHS England, has been updated to “strengthen existing messaging”, it states. But “no changes to the recommendations, including PPE, have been made in response to the new variant strains at this stage”, the guidance adds, though this is under constant review. The World Health Organization (WHO) has voiced concerns at the Covid-19 situation in South America, warning that outbreaks in the already hard-hit region were once again worsening. The WHO’s emergencies chief Michael Ryan said eight of the 10 countries reporting the coronavirus highest mortality rates in the last week were in the Americas, AFP reports. “The situation in South America right now remains of very high concern,” he told reporters. “South America was really in a difficult situation only a couple of months ago, and that situation again is starting to turn in the wrong direction.” “The disease transmission is intense, community transmission is widespread and healthcare systems remain under pressure,” he said stressing that those factors were being “reflected in mortality rates.” A Brazilian Supreme Court judge has given president Jair Bolsonaro five days to submit information regarding the government’s decision to host the Copa America football tournament despite the nation’s ongoing struggles with Covid-19. Reuters reports: The demand by Ricardo Lewandowski came in response to a suit filed by the opposition Workers’ Party, which objected to hosting the tournament given the current public health situation in Brazil and plunged the fate of Latin America’s biggest sporting event into uncertainty once more. Bolsonaro said earlier on Tuesday his government was on board with hosting the Copa America which starts on June 13, after planned host Argentina pulled out due to a dramatic worsening of the coronavirus pandemic there. It comes as Brazil struggles to cope with the ravages of a virus that has killed 462,791 people, according to government figures, the second-highest tally in the world. “Considering the importance of the matter and the public health emergency resulting from the coronavirus pandemic, as well as the urgency that the case requires, information from the president of the Republic is being requested within the legal deadline,” wrote Lewandowski in an order seen by Reuters. Speaking to supporters in Brasilia, Bolsonaro said he consulted with Health Minister Marcelo Queiroga and they had agreed the four-week long tournament played by 10 South American nations could take place. “As far as it is up to me, and all the ministers, including the health minister, it is all decided,” Bolsonaro said. India said it is aiming to triple capacity to 10 million jabs per day by July to avert another wave of Covid-19 infections as deadly as the outbreak suffered since April. Brazil’s President Jair Bolsinaro has come under fire for agreeing to host the Copa America football tournament in two weeks, despite his country potentially facing a third wave of infections. Heathrow airport in London has begun processing arrivals from red list countries in a dedicated terminal following concerns about them mixing with other passengers. Travellers arriving from red list nations on direct flights are being taken to Terminal 3. Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa called on faster delivery of vaccines to poorer countries, including by waiving patents on vaccine development. Peru has revised its official Covid-19 death toll to 180,764, nearly triple the previous official figure of 69,342, following a government review that shows the severity of the outbreak in the country. The World Health Organisation has recommended a new set of names for the coronavirus “variants of concern”, which will be known by letters of the Greek alphabet. Alpha is the new name for UK/Kent (B.1.1.7), Beta for South Africa (B.1.351), Gamma for Brazil (P.1) and Delta for the variant first detected in India (B.1.617.2). Malaysia has begun a tough nationwide lockdown to battle a worsening coronavirus outbreak. Of almost 2,800 deaths from Covid-19 recorded in the country of 32 million since the start of the pandemic, over 40 percent were in May alone. Israel announced it will begin phasing out coronavirus-related payments to the unemployed and Ireland announced similar steps later this year while maintaining other income and business supports as the economy fully reopens. South Africa and India’s push for a patent waiver on coronavirus vaccines was backed by other major emerging economies on Tuesday, who together called for quicker delivery of vaccines. Brazil, Russia and China echoed the call for a temporary waiver of intellectual property rights by the World Trade Organization, which they said would help poorer countries secure vaccine doses. The five countries also said there needed to be more transparency on pricing, transfer of technology, more local production and sharing of vaccines. The heads of the World Bank, International Monetary Fund, WTO and World Health Organization published a joint op-ed in a dozen newspapers across the world on Tuesday calling for greater vaccine equality. They said the World Bank’s $12 billion in financing to help buy and transport vaccines should soon support 50 countries but also warned that ensuring equal vaccine access needed solid commitments from richer nations. “It calls for upfront financing, upfront vaccine donations, and upfront precautionary investments and planning – rather than commitments that may be slow to materialize,” they said. After making $3 billion (£2.1 billion) selling Covid-19 tests last year, American company Abbott Laboratories has forecast its revenues to fall sharply, largely due to increased vaccination. Reuters reports the company’s shares dropped 6% after its announcement on Tuesday, in major contrast to the more than 20% rise over the course of 2020. The company said reduced demand for its tests has also been down to fewer cases in richer countries and US guidance that fully vaccinated people do not need to be tested to travel. It had previously forecast revenues of up to $7 million but revised the figure to $4 billion to $4.5 billion. France reported 127 new coronavirus deaths in hospitals on Tuesday, compared to 126 on Monday, and the number of Covid-19 patients remained on the decline, Reuters reports. The number of people in hospital with the virus fell by 508 to 16,088 and the number of people in intensive care units with Covid-19 fell by 120 to 2,825 people. Both numbers have been falling steadily for weeks. Italy reported 93 coronavirus-related deaths on Tuesday against 82 the day before, the health ministry said, while the daily tally of new infections rose to 2,483 from 1,820, Reuters reports. Italy has registered 126,221 deaths linked to COVID-19 since its outbreak emerged in February last year, the second-highest toll in Europe after Britain and the eight-highest in the world. The country has reported 4.22 million cases to date. The International Monetary Fund will provide grant financing for £25 billion of a proposed £35 billion project aimed at ramping up global vaccinations against the coronavirus, Reuters reports. IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva said at a joint news conference with the World Health Organization, the World Bank and the World Trade Organization: “We are creating a breeding ground for variants unless we act decisively to end the pandemic everywhere.” Meanwhile the World Bank announced that it has £8.5 billion in Covid-19 vaccine financing available and will have approved vaccination financing operations in over 50 countries by the end of June. The development lender’s president, David Malpass, said it was “vital that we speed up the supply chain for vaccine distribution,” including shortening the manufacturing time, approvals and allocations of doses that have already been produced. The Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, has sparked outrage after approving plans to hold South America’s answer to the European championship in his Covid-stricken country despite warnings Brazil is steaming into a potentially calamitous third wave of infections, Tom Philips reports. Full story here: Rachel Hall here taking over from Kaamil Ahmed. Do send over anything we’ve missed to rachel.hall@theguardian.com After vaccinating large sections of the population and exiting lockdowns, several countries are evaluating the health of their economies and support packages they have had in place. In Israel, where the economy has fully opened, the finance ministry announced Tuesday that it would be scaling down support for the unemployed, starting with under-28s without families, after complaints about businesses struggling to find workers. Ireland, where 385,000 people were receiving unemployment support in April, according to AFP, has announced a €4bn package to rectify the “enormous damage” caused by the pandemic. “Our core objective is to restore, and then go beyond pre-pandemic employment levels,” said Prime minister Micheal Martin. Italy’s economy grew faster in the first quarter of this year than previously estimated, according to new data. Both Gross Domestic Product and unemployment grew 0.1 percent compared to the previous quarter. “Italy is strong, alive and is yearning to restart. The pandemic months have been very tough, for workers and businesses,” Prime Minister Mario Draghi said during a visit in the northern Emilia Romagna region. “But thanks to sacrifices made by Italians and the strong acceleration of the vaccination campaign, we are facing a new phase.” The World Health Organization has approved the Chinese Sinovac vaccine for emergency use, it said in a statement. The second Chinese vaccine against Covid-19 to be approved as safe by the WHO, it said the vaccine would be allowed to delivered under Covax, the global vaccine-sharing programme. India wants to more than triple its supply of coronavirus vaccines to 10 million per day by July as it scales up a campaign seen as keen to avoiding another outbreak as disastrous as April’s, Reuters reports. “We don’t doubt that we will be able to increase the pace of vaccinations, once supply is ramped up,” government advisor V K Paul told reporters on Tuesday. Vaccine manufacturers such as Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech are scrambling to boost supplies, with the country is also in talks with major foreign vaccine producers such as Pfizer Inc, officials have said. The health ministry said nearly 45 million people had been fully vaccinated - 4.7% of the country’s 950 million adult population. India administered nearly 2.8 million doses on Monday, according to data from its official vaccine portal. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has drawn criticism for a slow vaccine rollout even though India is one of the world’s biggest manufacturers of doses, including AstraZeneca’s shot. Healthcare workers in Huthi-held territory in Yemen will be given vaccinations from next week, a World Health Organization official told Reuters. Adham Abdel-Moneim, the WHO’s representative in Yemen, said 10,000 doses arrived in the capital Sanaa yesterday and were put in cold storage. The WHO will run the campaign. Human Rights Watch on Tuesday accused the Huthi rebels of concealing the number of Covid-19 cases in areas it controls and blocking the delivery of vaccines, despite the country receiving 360,000 doses on 31 March. Vaccinations began almost two months ago in parts of Yemen controlled by the Saudi-backed government. Doctors marched throughout India to protest a popular guru who claimed yoga can defeat Covid-19, AFP reports. The doctors denounced and called for the arrest for Baba Ramdev, who claimed modern drugs were “stupid and failed science”. The doctors’ association at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), one of Delhi’s biggest government hospitals, called Ramdev’s comments “disgraceful”. Ramdev, a keen supporter of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, retracted his comments after an appeal by India’s health minister and the guru said he had been merely reading out other people’s WhatsApp messages. But he then caused further outcry by saying that he did not need a coronavirus vaccine because he was protected by yoga and traditional medicine, or Ayurveda. Moderna has followed Pfizer by filing for full approval of its coronavirus vaccine in the US, which is currently authorised for emergency use, Reuters reports. The company said it will be submitting data to the US Food and Drug Administration over coming weeks as it seeks priority approval for the vaccine. Scarce supplies of coronavirus vaccines are endangering refugees in Asia as their host countries experience surges in Covid-19 cases, the UN’s refugee agency, UNHCR, has warned. It urged manufacturers and countries with surplus vaccines to give more vaccines to Covax. Low supplies to the global vaccine-sharing initiative has meant delayed deliveries to countries relying on it. “These countries host the vast majority of more than 80 million forcibly displaced people in the world. Yet so far, they have benefited from only a fraction of the world’s Covid-19 vaccines,” UNHCR said on Tuesday. Not a single vaccine has been delivered in the Rohingya refugees camps in Bangladesh, where the total number of cases identified more than doubled in May alone. There were also increased among refugee populations in Nepal, Pakistan, Thailand, Malaysia, Iran and Indonesia, UNHCR said. Reuters are reporting that Poland will offer Covid-19 vaccinations to children aged 12-15 from 7 June. Michal Dworczyk, the minister in charge of the country’s vaccination programme, announced the move this morning. The European Commission on Friday authorized the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine for use in children as young as 12. The Italian government has allocated €50m to help treat the estimated 164,000 people suffering from serious health problems associated with ‘long Covid’. The money will be used for regular check-ups, including of the heart, lungs and kidneys, of patients until the end of 2023 as part of a strategy also aimed at allowing medics to research the long-term impact of the virus. More than a third of Italians suffering from serious symptoms of long-Covid are from Lombardy, the region hardest-hit by the pandemic. Antonio Pisani, a neurologist at the Mondino research centre, told Il Sole 24 Ore that the risk of neurological disorders is high. Among the most common symptoms he sees among patients are ongoing fatigue, dizziness and difficulty concentrating. He said there were also signs that the virus could predispose people to diseases including Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s. “I had two patients who, before March 2020, had never visited a neurologis … a month ago one was diagnosed with Parkinson’s and the other Alzheimer’s. Therefore it’s as if Covid was an accelerator for a disease that was already there but had not yet presented itself.” Delivery to the Philippines of the first batches of a promised 17m doses of AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine made in Thailand has been delayed by several weeks, a Philippine presidential adviser has said. The delay raises questions about AstraZeneca’s vaccine distribution plan in Southeast Asia, which depend on 200m doses made by Siam Bioscience, a company owned by Thailand’s king that is making vaccines for the first time. Joey Concepcion, a presidential adviser who has been coordinating vaccine procurement with the Philippine government and private sector, told Reuters that AstraZeneca had informed him delivery of the first batch of 1.3m doses would have to be pushed back from the third week of June to mid-July and also reduced to 1.17m doses. Concepcion said he was in touch daily with AstraZeneca and was told there were delays in Thai production. “It is a new plant they are running … that is how it is when you start a new plant,” he said. AstraZeneca has faced legal action in Europe over a failure to deliver supplies as promised. Yemen’s Huthi rebels, who control most of the country’s north including the capital Sanaa, have been blocking international efforts to supply Covid vaccines, Human Rights Watch said. The New York-based group accused Huthi leaders of suppressing information about both the dangers of Covid and the prevalence of the disease in territory under their control. “The deliberate decision of the Huthi authorities to keep the real number of cases of Covid-19 under wraps and their opposition to vaccines are putting Yemeni lives at risk,” said HRW’s deputy Middle East director Michael Page. “Pretending Covid-19 does not exist is not a mitigation strategy and will only lead to mass suffering. “Given the weakened healthcare system in Yemen, Huthi authorities should at least ensure transparency so that civilians living in their areas can understand the scale of the pandemic and facilitate an international vaccination plan that meets the needs on the ground.” AFP report that Yemen received 360,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine on 31 March, the first of 1.9 million doses to be delivered this year through the Covax programme for poorer countries. However, the rebels’ failure to cooperate with the World Health Organization and the Yemeni government has prevented any vaccines from reaching the north, HRW said citing a medical source with “direct knowledge of the circumstances”. As a result, vaccinations have only been occurring in the government-held south. HRW quoted Huthi officials as dismissing Covid-19 as a “conspiracy”. “America bears the primary responsibility for the Covid-19 epidemic,” it quoted rebel leader Abdul Malik al-Huthi, as saying in a televised speech last year. Heathrow airport in London has begun processing arrivals from red list countries in a dedicated terminal following concerns about them mixing with other passengers. Travellers arriving from red list nations on direct flights are being taken to Terminal 3. Russia has announced the resumption of air travel with Britain and a number of other countries – Austria, Hungary, Lebanon, Luxembourg, Croatia, Mauritius, and Morocco – which had been suspended due to coronavirus restrictions. Peru has revised its official Covid-19 death toll to 180,764, nearly triple the previous official figure of 69,342, following a government review that shows the severity of the outbreak in the country. The World Health Organisation has recommended a new set of names for the coronavirus “variants of concern”, which will be known by letters of the Greek alphabet. Alpha is the new name for UK/Kent (B.1.1.7), Beta for South Africa (B.1.351), Gamma for Brazil (P.1) and Delta for the variant first detected in India (B.1.617.2). Chinese authorities in Guangdong province have cancelled flights and locked down communities in response to what is believed to be the first community outbreak of the “Delta” or Indian variant in China. Malaysia has begun a tough nationwide lockdown to battle a worsening coronavirus outbreak. Of almost 2,800 deaths from Covid-19 recorded in the country of 32 million since the start of the pandemic, over 40 percent were in May alone. Taiwan has reported 13 new deaths from Covid-19, and 262 new cases. In a sign that authorities are also clearing the backlog of test results which had seen hundreds added to previous daily totals and caused difficulties in analysing any trends, there were just 65 new positive cases announced today. Germany’s Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious disease is to reduce the coronavirus risk level for the country to “high” from “very high”, health minister Jens Spahn said. A leading scientific adviser to the UK government has repeated calls to delay the 21 June lifting of restrictions by “a few weeks”, warning the coronavirus’s ability to adapt in the face of vaccines has still left the UK in a vulnerable position. Ireland will begin to gradually phase out temporary coronavirus-related jobless payments later this year while maintaining other income and business supports as the economy fully reopens, public expenditure minister Michael McGrath. Australians who have been vaccinated against Covid would be able to leave the country and return with less strict quarantine requirements under a plan that could be trialled within six weeks. Our community team are interested to hear about your experiences of travelling through Heathrow, now that London’s airport has opened up a terminal specifically to deal with arrivals from the so-called “red list” countries. If you’ve travelled and want to get in touch with them, you can find all the details here… Australians who have been vaccinated against Covid would be able to leave the country and return with less strict quarantine requirements under a plan that could be trialled within six weeks. The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, revealed the proposal in the Coalition party room on Tuesday following a question from Liberal MP Jason Falinski, who had asked whether vaccination could see people exempted from outbound and inbound travel restrictions. Australia shut its borders in March 2020 in response to the coronavirus pandemic imposing two weeks hotel quarantine on those arriving into the country. Outbound travel is also banned – which was upheld by the full federal court on Tuesday – although more than 140,000 Australian citizens and residents have travelled overseas for critical business, on compassionate grounds or for other exempted reasons. With Australia struggling to vaccinate its population by the end of 2021, there is pressure on the federal government to provide incentives to get the jab and to ease the travel ban that has separated families. About 40,000 Australians remain stranded overseas due to flight caps imposed as a result of limited hotel quarantine beds.

These are the four you need to know: Alpha - UK/Kent (B.1.1.7) Beta - South Africa (B.1.351) Gamma - Brazil (P.1) Delta - India (B.1.617.2) For ease of use to start with, I’ll try to make sure I am using all three ways of naming each variant until we all get more acquainted with the new terminology. There’s fuller details here: Covid-19 variants to be given Greek alphabet names to avoid stigma The proposed Copa América this summer is in some disarray, with reports that Brazil will replace hosts Argentina, just 13 days before it is due to start. “The Copa América 2021 will be played in Brazil,” an official Conmebol statement said. “Tournament start and end dates are confirmed. The venues and the fixtures will be announced by Conmebol in the next few hours.” The tournament, featuring 10 South American nations, had been due to be held in Argentina and Colombia with joint hosts for the first time in its 105-year history. Colombia was removed as a co-host on 20 May after a wave of protests demanding social and economic change spread across the country, and Argentina has followed. Now Reuters report that Chilean national soccer star Arturo Vidal has been diagnosed with Covid-19 and is in hospital in what appears to be a an isolated case as the squad readies itself for World Cup qualifying match against Argentina on 3 June. “He was diagnosed positive for Covid in the daily preventive exam performed today,” the team said in a statement late yesterday. The team plan to travel to Argentina for the game today. A quick Reuters snap here that Germany’s Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious disease is to reduce the coronavirus risk level for the country to “high” from “very high” as the situation improves, health minister Jens Spahn said on Tuesday. “We have grounds for optimism,” said Spahn at a news conference with the head of the RKI, Lothar Wieler, who said developments were improving but the pandemic was not yet over. Ireland will begin to gradually phase out temporary coronavirus-related jobless payments later this year while maintaining other income and business supports as the economy fully reopens, public expenditure minister Michael McGrath said today. Ireland is emerging from its third and longest lockdown having had one the strictest regimes in Europe for the last 15 months, leaving more than 300,000 people who lost their jobs claiming the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP). Local media reported that the PUP, which is paid out at a higher rate than regular jobless benefits, would be reduced from September and withdrawn by February 2022. “There won’t be a cliff edge in July, we will be looking at an extension of the PUP but also laying out a pathway towards the normalisation of our social welfare code and ultimately unwinding a payment that is pandemic related,” McGrath told national broadcaster RTE. “The changes will be gradual.” The number of people temporarily or permanently unemployed in Ireland stood at 22.4% at the end April, with around three in four on the PUP. McGrath said he expected that cohort to fall very significantly over coming weeks as the economy reopens. He added that additional supports for businesses reopening would be announced later today. Padraic Halpin reminds us for Reuters that the government allowed all shops to open for the first time this year two weeks ago with the hospitality sector to follow with limited capacity in coming days. Nicola Slawson has launched our UK live blog for the day, with the leads line being the warning that the country is in a “perilous moment”. Join her for the latest UK Covid news as it comes in today. I’ll be continuing here with the latest coronavirus news from around the world. Taiwan has reported 13 new deaths from Covid-19, and 262 new cases. In a sign that authorities are also clearing the backlog of test results which had seen hundreds added to previous daily totals and caused difficulties in analysing any trends, there were just 65 new positive cases announced today. The majority of the new cases remained in the north, with 166 in New Taipei city, 87 in Taipei city, and 23 in Taoyuan. Health and welfare minister Chen Shih-Chung said reinfection rates had declined thanks to the measures introduced over the past two weeks - and the community’s cooperation with them - but said it was still not time to relax. Chen the backlog of cases was expected to be cleared in the next day or two. The daily number of vaccinations has increased, but Taiwan still remains far behind other countries, with less than 2% of its population having received a shot. Taiwan’s problems with a Covid-19 vaccination drive are complicated, and involved accusations of geopolitical interference as well as of government bungling, but the important news from recent days is that the government is now allowing private companies, religious groups and local governments to arrange imports. Tech giant Foxconn and its billionaire founder Terry Gou have sought permission to buy 5 million vaccines from Germany’s BioNTech, to distribute among the general population. Gou said on Saturday they hope to airlift the shots from Germany to Taiwan without going via any middlemen. This has received a lukewarm reaction from the government. Chen expressed his gratitude to Gou and said the government was reviewing the application, adding that while it welcomes help in obtaining vaccines from companies and religious groups, Taiwan’s government has stipulated that only it can distribute the shots. Russia has announced the resumption of air travel with Britain and a number of other countries which had been suspended due to coronavirus restrictions. “Given the improvement of the epidemiological situation in the United Kingdom, a decision has been taken to resume regular air travel between Moscow and London from 2 June,” Russian health authorities said in a statement on Monday. Russia will also resume air travel with Austria, Hungary, Lebanon, Luxembourg, Croatia, Mauritius, and Morocco from 10 June, it said. Flights to Turkey, a major tourist destination for Russians, will remain suspended until at least 21 June. AFP note that since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, Russia’s borders have remained largely closed to foreigners. Heathrow has begun processing arrivals from red list countries in a dedicated terminal following concerns about them mixing with other passengers. Travellers arriving from red list nations on direct flights are being taken to Terminal 3. Passengers travelling to the UK on connecting flights from red list locations continue to transit through the airport alongside those from green and amber countries. The red list currently consists of 43 nations from which arrivals are deemed to present a high risk of importing coronavirus. Red list countries from where direct flights to the UK are permitted include India, the Philippines, Pakistan, Kenya and Bangladesh. Passengers arriving in the UK after being in one of those destinations during the previous 10 days must spend 11 nights in a quarantine hotel, costing 1,750 for solo travellers. The decision to separate arrivals on direct flights from red list destinations was welcomed by the GMB union, which had previously warned that “bottlenecks” are putting passengers and staff at risk. Heathrow insisted there were “several layers of protection to keep passengers and colleagues safe”, such as mandatory testing for all arrivals, segregation and ventilation. PA Media notes that an airport executive said in April that passengers are being forced to queue for up to six hours to be processed through immigration halls. It is the first time Terminal 3 has been used since April 2020, when it was closed to save costs amid the collapse in demand for travel. Heathrow plans to move its new facility for processing red list arrivals to Terminal 4 “as soon as operationally possible”. The pressure to get England’s Covid restrictions dropped on 21 June is coming from several quarters, not least those sectors of the hospitality industry that are still unable to open their doors. CEO of the Night Time Industries Association, Michael Kill, has been pushing for earlier clarification of when reopening might happen. He told Sky News: Nine out of 10 late-night businesses feel that veering off the roadmap would threaten their survival. Ninety-five per cent of businesses have already made financial commitments in terms of stock, staff and entertainment. So this is a key time, and the government really needs to step up and make it very clear exactly what their intentions are. The UK’s small businesses minister Paul Scully has been on LBC this morning reiterating the message from the government that people in the UK should use “caution” in the face of the growing number of cases of the “Delta” variant of coronavirus – the B.1.617.2 variant first detected in India. He stressed again that no decision would be taken until 14 June, saying: I know for some people that won’t be quick enough, but we’ve got to make sure that we are working with the latest data, accurate data. Scientists have to be able to go through this with a fine tooth comb, because it’s a really really important decision that affects so many people. Pressed about whether the country was in fact seeing increased hospitalisations and what the threat to the NHS currently was, he said: We’ve just got to make sure that we are looking forward to see what happens in the next few weeks and months in terms of that modelling, based on the data. Because what we do know is that when case rates go up, hospitalisations to date have also gone up. But the vaccination progress is still continuing with 63 million vaccinations and that is what is going to help us win this race. Eddie Blake writes for us this morning, asking what should Britain’s memorial to the Covid pandemic look like? Memorials aim to be an eloquent last word on an event. A key quality is that they resist change: they attempt to fix for us an abiding sense of what exactly has happened. They can be many things: columns, tombs, plaques, cenotaphs, village halls, even housing. But who are they for? The people who suffered, their families, the wider public or future generations? At some point, inevitably, there will be an official, national memorial of the pandemic in the UK (as well as many more, surely, at local and international levels). What, then, should it look like? It will have to contend with how messy the past year has been – the death, the sorrow, the fear, but also the ensuing political and social division. Perhaps through all of that, memorialisation can play a therapeutic role. Memorials naturally remove some of the complexity of the past, replacing it with something smoother, better suited to a broad audience: the tomb of the Unknown Warrior doesn’t address one specific loss, so it can talk of all loss. Because of this universal ambition it is vital public memorials hit the right tone – being both honest and broadly interpretable, tending to avoid friction. As a result, though, memorials can feel as if they don’t talk to you directly or seem too vague. But at a time when narratives are brutally contested, it seems unlikely that a pandemic memorial will avoid controversy, no matter how skilful the architect. Read more here: Eddie Blake – What should Britain’s memorial to the Covid pandemic look like? Prof Adam Finn, from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, is a second expert in the UK on the airwaves today warning against further easing of domestic restrictions on 21 June. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “There’s vulnerability across the country. The idea that somehow the job is done, is wrong. “We’ve still got a lot of people out there who’ve neither had this virus … nor yet been immunised, and that’s why we’re in a vulnerable position right now.” PA Media reports Finn added: “There are a lot of people who are very fed up about the idea of us even worrying about this. Since I’ve been saying in the last 24 hours that we should be cautious I’ve been getting lots of messages from people telling me to shut up basically. “But the truth is that a more infectious virus, which is what it looks like we’ve got, will reach people who are vulnerable – those who did not make a good response to the vaccine, those who have not yet had their doses – and that will be a problem for everyone because in the end it will be worse economically as well as for public health if we end up having to shut down again.” Chinese authorities in Guangdong province have cancelled flights and locked down communities in response to what is believed to be the first community outbreak of the “Delta” or Indian variant in China. Guangdong province had been reporting daily single figures of local cases, including asymptomatic cases, for more than a week, until the case load suddenly jumped to 23 on Monday, including three asymptomatic cases, and 11 on Tuesday. Most of Guandong’s cases are in the city of Guangzhou, with some in nearby Foshan, which has a population of 7.2 million. Authorities said all cases were found to be the strain commonly known as the Indian variant of the virus, now renamed by the WHO as the “Delta” variant. “In this race against the virus, we must run a bit ahead and run faster than before in order to block the spread of the virus and cut off the infection chain in time,” said Huang Guanglie, director of the Guangzhou municipal health commission. Guangzhou deputy mayor, Li Ming, said the strain had a short incubation period, a high viral load, and spread quickly. However she said that the trajectory was “under control”. In response hundreds of flights at the busy Guangdong Baiyun international airport have been cancelled, and authorities ordered some streets in the Liwan neighbourhood of Guangzhou city to isolate at home, with only one person per household allowed out to buy daily necessities. On Sunday, all 15.3 million Guangzhou residents were barred from leaving via bus, air or train without a green code on the health management app and a negative Covid test taken in the preceding 72 hours. Read more of Helen Davidson’s report here: China locks down part of Guangzhou amid outbreak of Indian Covid variant Malaysia has begun a tough nationwide lockdown to battle a worsening coronavirus outbreak, AFP reports, as countries across Southeast Asia struggle with a resurgence in cases driven by infectious variants. It writes, Much of the region escaped the pandemic’s first wave last year relatively unscathed by rapidly closing borders and introducing curbs. But countries from Thailand to Vietnam are being hammered by fresh surges, with efforts to quell outbreaks hampered by slow vaccine rollouts and populations weary of restrictions. Malaysia is among the worst hit. Of almost 2,800 deaths from Covid-19 recorded in the country of 32 million since the start of the pandemic, over 40 percent were in May alone. More than 570,000 infections have been reported, with a string of new daily records last week. As well as variants, the outbreak has been fanned by gatherings in the Muslim-majority country during the holy month of Ramadan and the Eid al-Fitr holiday, often in defiance of coronavirus rules. Under what authorities have termed a “total lockdown” in force from Tuesday, only essential businesses - such as supermarkets and medical clinics - can operate, people can only go outside for necessities, and most schools are closed. Travel between most parts of the country had already been banned for months. Just following up on Prof Ravi Gupta’s words there with a quick check on the UK government’s own coronavirus dashboard, and we can see that with data in from 31 May now, that the rolling seven-day averages of cases, deaths and hospitalisations are all up – all admittedly from a baseline much lower than was in the earlier peak of the second wave of the virus. You can have look for yourself here. A leading scientific adviser to the UK government has repeated calls to delay the 21 June lifting of restrictions by “a few weeks”, warning the coronavirus’s ability to adapt in the face of vaccines has still left the UK in a vulnerable position. Prof Ravi Gupta, a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), said the increased socialisation which has followed last month’s phase of restriction lifting could be expected to lead to “quite a lot” of hospital admissions. PA Media reports that he told ITV’s Good Morning Britain that while the nation had performed “amazingly well” in its vaccination programme, it was still too early “to put the vaccine straight up against the virus”. Gupta said a delay of a few weeks to the 21 June target could have a significant impact on Britain’s battle against the pandemic, and recommended it should be made clear to the public that it would be a temporary measure based on recent events, chiefly the emergence of the newly-designated “Delta variant”, which we had previously been calling the B.1.617.2 strain of the virus or the variant that was first detected in India. “Even a month delay could have a big impact on the eventual outcome of this,” said Prof Gupta. He continued: “As long as it’s clear to people this is not an unlimited extension of the lockdown but actually just a reassessment, that would be realistic. “Because we didn’t plan for the 617.2 variant when the initial roadmap was made, and actually things have gone really well except for the fact that we have this new variant to complicate things. “We must remember this is a virus that does adapt, and faced with vaccines it will eventually start to make mutations to avoid them even further, and then we could be in an even more precarious situation after that.” Vietnam is seeking to buy Covid-19 vaccine production technology and wants to build a plant to supply the Covax programme, Reuters reports, as the country tries to step up vaccinations to stem a new outbreak of infections. India and South Africa are among developing countries that have been pushing for an intellectual property waiver for Covid-19 vaccines. But even with a surprise US shift last month to support a waiver World Trade Organization talks on the issue on Monday failed to achieve a breakthrough. “Vietnam would build the plant and would like to receive the patent so it could supply vaccines to Covax, to other countries as well as to Vietnam,” the health ministry said in a statement, following a meeting with Covax representatives overnight. India has reported its lowest daily rise in new coronavirus infections since 8 April at 127,510 cases over the past 24 hours, while deaths rose by 2,795, Reuters reports. The South Asian nation’s tally of infections now stands at 28.2 million, while the death toll has reached 331,895, health ministry data showed. That’s it from me, Helen Livingstone, for today. I’m handing over to my colleague Martin Belam in London. Here’s a quick roundup of what’s been happening so far: Peru has revised its official Covid-19 death toll to 180,764, nearly triple the previous official figure of 69,342, following a government review that shows the severity of the outbreak in the country. As new coronavirus variants continue to be discovered, the World Health Organization has revealed new names, after the letters of the Greek alphabet, to simplify the discussion around the variants and avoid stigma. Australia’s drug regulator says it may refer anti-vaccination Facebook posts to federal police after anti-vaccine campaigners targeted an MP who posted about getting the jab. Australia’s federal court has rejected a bid by a rightwing thinktank to overturn the country’s ban on outbound travel. US gun sales spiked during the pandemic and continue to rise, with first-time buyers making up more than a fifth of those who purchased guns Germany has pledged to crack down on fraud in coronavirus test centres, after evidence that some have been claiming for more tests than they have carried out. Scientists are urging the government to speed up second doses of Covid vaccines and delay a decision on easing lockdown restrictions in England on 21 June in an effort to tackle the creeping spread of new cases. France has opened up vaccines to all adults a week before Germany, as Europe rushed to avoid another wave of infections caused by new virus variants. Vietnam has announced the suspension of incoming international flights to its capital and tightened restrictions in its biggest city. The inbound flight suspension to Hanoi will apply from 1-7 June. Travellers from the UK will have to provide “compelling reasons” to enter France from Monday, as French authorities tighten curbs to halt the spread of the Indian Covid variant. The European Commission has proposed that all EU countries gradually ease travel measures over the summer. School closures in England during the Covid lockdown badly damaged the mental health of mothers but had no impact on fathers’ wellbeing, research has found. Here’s a sobering, but important, feature by Guardian contributor V on the ways in which the pandemic has erased women’s rights and left them vulnerable to violence. She writes, All over the world, patriarchy has taken full advantage of the virus to reclaim power – on the one hand, escalating the danger and violence to women, and on the other, stepping in as their supposed controller and protector. And in more Australia-related Covid news, the country’s drug regulator is considering referring Covid vaccine misinformation posts to the federal police, after anti-vaccine campaigners targeted an MP who posted about getting the jab. In response to a viral post of Labor backbencher Julian Hill receiving his vaccine, numerous users posted false material purportedly from the Therapeutic Goods Administration wrongly claiming Covid-19 vaccines have caused more than 200 deaths. The figure they used was in fact the number of people who have died after receiving the vaccine, but apart from one case, none have been linked by the TGA to the vaccine. The TGA told Guardian Australia the alleged posting of the death counter was “particularly concerning” and it would consider referring it to the federal police. Australia’s federal court has rejected a bid by a rightwing thinktank to overturn the country’s ban on outbound travel. Libertyworks had argued that the health minister, Greg Hunt, has no power to impose a blanket rule stopping citizens from leaving the country. But Justices Anna Katzmann, Michael Wigney and Thomas Thawley dismissed the application and ordered Libertyworks to pay the commonwealth’s costs. The federal government had argued that, if successful, the case would have “driven a truck” through Hunt’s powers under the Biosecurity Act to impose measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19 during the global pandemic.

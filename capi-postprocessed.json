They provide agony and ecstasy, to use the most popular clich√©, but also drama, controversy, desperation and occasionally the highest farce. Most of all, they give us brilliant, sometimes legendary stories. And in today‚Äôs League One play-off final at Wembley, we are guaranteed a feelgood belter of a tale.</p> <p>In the black corner, we have Lincoln City. If they are promoted, they will play in the second tier for the first time since 1961, and continue the spectacular rise of a club that was in the National League as recently as 2017. In the tangerine corner, we have Blackpool FC. They are recovering from 32 years of ever increasing misery under the revolting ownership of Owen Oyston. He was finally removed a cojple of years ago, and Blackpool‚Äôs storming run into the play-offs - they were 15th at the end of January - has enhanced the feeling of a club reborn. </p> <p>There‚Äôs plenty of neutral goodwill towards both clubs and their impressive young coaches, Neil Critchley at Blackpool and Michael Appleton at Lincoln. The only shame is that they can‚Äôt both be promoted.</p> <p><strong>Kick off </strong>3pm</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-05-30T12:56:09.325Z\">at 1.56pm BST</time></p>  </div>","wordcount":"1983","firstPublicationDate":"2021-05-30T12:45:02Z","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2021-05-30T15:15:06Z","liveBloggingNow":"true","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/p/htzd3","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc5ef7bf1c947e0272cd7db3c39a4ffeb98a009b/0_96_2700_1620/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","isLive":"true","bodyText":"57 min I think I‚Äôm right in saying that, before today, Kenny Dougall had scored two goals in his three seasons in English football. Both his goals were beautifully struck, one with each foot. Mitchell‚Äôs cross from the right took a slight deflection and ran through to Yates, 12 yards out with his back to goal. He thought about a shot, realised it wasn‚Äôt on and played a slow, inviting pass to Dougall on the edge of the D. This time he went with his right foot, drilling a daisy-cutter into the bottom-left corner. That was so sweetly struck. Kenny Dougall scores another superb goal! 50 min Embleton plays a slick one-two with Turton and wins a corner. It‚Äôs curled under the bar and punched away a little desperately by Palmer. Moments later, Stewart cracks a bouncing ball over the bar from distance. 48 min Ballard is booked for a foul on Rogers. 47 min The goalscorer Dougall slides a through ball towards Yates, but Walsh comes across to intercept. 46 min Peep peep! Blackpool begin the second half. Peep peep! It‚Äôs level at Wembley after a fascinating first half. Lincoln went ahead after 47 seconds through an own goal from Ollie Turton, but they became passive thereafter and allowed Blackpool into the game. They accepted the invitation with a fine equaliser from Kenny Dougall, though there was an unpunished handball by Elliot Embleton in the build up. Jorge Grant, who was at fault for the Blackpool goal, had earlier hit the crossbar with a fine effort. At the other end Blackpool had a number of shots on target, though all bar Dougall‚Äôs were straight at the keeper Palmer. 45 min Blackpool continue to press for a second goal. Neil Critchley will be thrilled with their calm, authoritative response to that abysmal start. 41 min Lincoln may need another half-time brollocking from Michael Appleton. They are hanging on a little bit now, and Palmer has to make another save when Mitchell meets Garbutt‚Äôs cross with a decent header. 40 min Embleton, who is looking increasingly dangerous, shoots straight at Palmer from 22 yards. 39 min Palmer will be annoyed that he was beaten at his near post, but it was a very clean strike from Dougall with his left foot. I think Palmer saw it late as well. He did get a hand on it but couldn‚Äôt keep it out. 37 min A Lincoln free-kick is half cleared to Edun, who sprays over from 25 yards. 36 min Lincoln had been asking for trouble, playing too passively after the first 10 minutes. I suppose it‚Äôs human nature to do that when you go ahead so early in such a vital game, but it‚Äôs not always the best policy. 35 min There‚Äôs no VAR in the play-offs. I think the goal would have been disallowed if VAR was in use, though it‚Äôs not certain. You could argue there was enough time between the accidental handball and Dougall‚Äôs goal to invalidate the offence. Yates stole the ball off Grant in the centre circle, moved forward and found Embleton on the edge of the area. He ran into trouble and lost the ball, but then Walsh‚Äôs clearance hit him on the hand and dropped at his feet, 20 yards from goal. He squared it to Dougall, who whistled a superb low past Palmer at the near post. Kenny Dougall equalises for Blackpool - and Lincoln are furious! 32 min ‚ÄúAfternoon Rob,‚Äù says Lee Smith. ‚ÄúPerhaps a confirmed Lancastrian such as Phil Sawyer (5th minute) should remain focused on the Roses drubbing currently being handed out to the White Rose fraternity. Either that or enjoy Brennan Johnson before he heads back to Nottingham!‚Äù Nottingham via Azerbaijan and Italy, I hope. 31 min Brennan Johnson, who has been quiet since that flying start, has started to see more of the ball in the last few minutes. I can‚Äôt wait to see him in the Championship with Forest next season. 27 min: Good save from Palmer! The ball ricochets kindly into the path of Yates on the left side of the area. His clever cutback just evades Husband and runs on to Mitchell, who sweeps a first-time shot towards goal with his left foot. It‚Äôs sweetly struck but too close to Palmer, who beats it away. 26 min At the other end, Embleton‚Äôs looping cross is headed over by the backpedalling Mitchell. It wasn‚Äôt much of a chance. 25 min: Grant hits the bar! Lincoln come so close to making it 2-0. Rogers zips infield from the left and plays a crisp pass into Grant, unmarked 20 yards from goal. He has time to turn and hit an extravagant curling shot that beats Maxwell and clatters off the top of the bar. 23 min Blackpool have had 88 per cent of the possession in the last five minutes. Most of it has been harmless, but it‚Äôs another sign that they have cleared their heads from the shock of that first-minute own-goal. 22 min ‚ÄúAny comments on the booing clearly heard on TV,‚Äù says Dave Stevens. ‚ÄúTV commentators ignored it.‚Äù When the players took a knee? I was typing something about it when Turton scored the own goal, and I got lost in that. But yes, it was audible. It‚Äôs hard to know what to say really. 21 min Free-kick to Blackpool, 25 yards from goal. Garbutt strikes it well but straight at Palmer. 18 min This is a good spell for Blackpool, who have pinned Lincoln back for the last five or six minutes. 16 min Ballard, in his own half, booms a long angled pass to Yates on the left side of the area. He feeds the underlapping Garbutt, whose cross is put behind for a corner by Johnson. This time Walsh heads clear. 15 min And now their first shot on target. Mitchell makes a promising run infield from the right but hits a weak effort straight at Palmer. 13 min Blackpool win their first corner, another sign they are getting into the game after that desperate. Garbutt swings it in, Hopper heads clear. 11 min Blackpool enjoy their first extended spell of possession. Eventually Husband drives a long pass towards Yates, who is just beaten to the ball by the alert keeper Alex Palmer. 9 min The resulting free-kick is curled to the near post, where Walsh heads over from six yards. That was a fairly decent chance; he couldn‚Äôt quite get over the ball. 9 min Garbutt is booked for clattering Johnson, the Welsh winger who has made a sensational start to the game. 6 min Brennan Johnson has made a superb start on the right wing. His low cross is put behind for Lincoln‚Äôs first corner. It‚Äôs curled towards the penalty spot and headed away by Husband. Never mind clearing with the head; Blackpool urgently need to clear their heads. 5 min ‚ÄúAfternoon, Rob,‚Äù says Phil Sawyer. ‚ÄúAs The Only Blackpool Lad In Lincoln, I‚Äôm keeping my head down this afternoon. I‚Äôm stocked up on tangerines should a baying mob storm Sawyer Towers post-match, hungry for blood. If you never hear from me again, know that I fought to the last squirt of citric acid and stick of rock. Seasiders!‚Äù 3 min What a nightmare for Ollie Turton. His brain and body just weren‚Äôt in sync. He must have been distracted by Hopper and the keeper Maxwell missing the ball at the near post, because he was a bit slow to adjust his body position and that‚Äôs why the ball went into his own net rather than behind for a corner. Michael Appleton said his team had to come out of the traps, and by heaven they have. Johnson charged at the left-back Garbutt and fizzed a low cross into the six-yard box. It was missed by Hopper at the near post and turned into his own net by Ollie Turton! Lincoln are ahead after 47 seconds! 1 min Peep peep! Lincoln, in their black away strip, kick off from right to left. Blackpool are wearing tangerine. It‚Äôs a gorgeous day at Wembley, and the 10,000 fans in attendance are making a rousing noise. The players line up for the national anthem, and what a timeless cracker it is. With ten minutes to go until kick off, here‚Äôs a reminder of the teams. Blackpool (4-2-3-1) Maxwell; Turton, Ballard, Husband, Garbutt; Dougall, Stewart; Mitchell, Embleton, Anderson; Yates. Substitutes: Moore, Gabriel, Ekpiteta, Thornley, Ward, Hamilton, Madine. Lincoln (4-1-4-1) Palmer; Poole, Eyoma, Walsh, Edun; Bridcutt; Johnson, McGrandles, Grant, Rogers; Hopper. Substitutes: Long, Montsma, Sanders, Scully, Bramall, Morton, Anderson. Referee Tony Harrington. And here‚Äôs the Lincoln manager Michael Appleton ‚Äú[On their delayed arrival] Hopefully it won‚Äôt affect us too much. These things can happen with London traffic - I think there was a big accident and one of the roads was shut. Listen, the lads will be ready by 3 o‚Äôclock. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got to come out of the traps - we know Blackpool will start fast and we need to compete with them. The longer the game goes on and stays close, that‚Äôs when we start to back ourselves. We always tend to finish strongly. But we know Blackpool are very organised, efficient and hard to beat.‚Äù The thoughts of Blackpool manager Neil Critchley ‚ÄúI really feel for the kid [Ellis Simms]. It was basically the last kick of the training session yesterday - he took a penalty and felt something go. It‚Äôs heartbreaking. He was going to start today, so for that to be taken away in such cruel circumstances is a body blow for us and even more so for him. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had key players out all season. We‚Äôre adaptable and flexible in our thinking, and we‚Äôre ready - we‚Äôre good to go. We‚Äôve had a good rest since the semi-final. Other than the heat [it‚Äôs around 20 degrees], we‚Äôll be fine!‚Äù Lincoln didn‚Äôt arrive at Wembley until 2.15pm, according to David Prutton on Sky Sports. I can‚Äôt speak for the Lincoln players but I would hate that. I panic if I‚Äôm not in the MBM dungeon an hour before kick-off, so I‚Äôd be all over the show if I was a player. Blackpool had a fairly comfortable passage to Wembley, beating Oxford 6-3 on aggregate in their semi-final. Lincoln‚Äôs progress was much more dramatic. They recovered from a desperate first half at the Stadium of Light last Saturday to eliminate Sunderland in memorable style. Pre-match reading A blow for Blackpool: the in-form Ellis Simms, on loan from Everton, picked up a knock in training and doesn‚Äôt even make the bench. Conor McGrandles, an influential substitute in Lincoln‚Äôs semi-final win over Sunderland, starts in place of Anthony Scully. There are umpteen things that make the play-offs so compelling, even for the neutral. They provide agony and ecstasy, to use the most popular clich√©, but also drama, controversy, desperation and occasionally the highest farce. Most of all, they give us brilliant, sometimes legendary stories. And in today‚Äôs League One play-off final at Wembley, we are guaranteed a feelgood belter of a tale. In the black corner, we have Lincoln City. If they are promoted, they will play in the second tier for the first time since 1961, and continue the spectacular rise of a club that was in the National League as recently as 2017. In the tangerine corner, we have Blackpool FC. They are recovering from 32 years of ever increasing misery under the revolting ownership of Owen Oyston. He was finally removed a cojple of years ago, and Blackpool‚Äôs storming run into the play-offs - they were 15th at the end of January - has enhanced the feeling of a club reborn. There‚Äôs plenty of neutral goodwill towards both clubs and their impressive young coaches, Neil Critchley at Blackpool and Michael Appleton at Lincoln. The only shame is that they can‚Äôt both be promoted.

Elsewhere, Dimitrov is nearly there, 4-1 up on Giron in set three, while while Nishikori has won set three and now leads Giannessi 2-1. Yeah, Andujar is nervous and quickly faces break-back point ... so carts an ace down the T! That is superb behaviour! Thiem then goes long with a return and Andujar has another set point! He‚Äôll need to do it with a second serve too, and Thiem looks primed ... to cloud an inside-out forehand wide! We‚Äôve go waselves a decider! Andujar 4-6 5-7 6-3 6-4 Thiem How are your nerves, Pablo Andujar? When his first serve goes in he‚Äôs winning 60 percent of points and he finds one first up, but soon has to claw his way back to 30-all. Then Thiem sends a return long and it‚Äôs set point ... but Andujar, behind in the next rally, tries a lob, which Thiem punishes. Deuce it is.... Thiem rinses through a hold, forcing Andujar to serve for it. Hang on, mates! Andujar 4-6 5-7 6-3 5-4 Thiem Andujar gets himself to 40-0 but then Thiem manages to get to within a point and tries a drop ... Andujar reads and takes control of the rally, then a shot later, a leaping backhand, flicked along the net, gives him 5-3! I wonder where we‚Äôll go from here. The tournament organisers asked her to reconsider and tried to check on her well-being, but no conversation happened. Thiem is back into this, yanking back a break then saving a break point before holding; he‚Äôs within a game of Andujar, and it feels like momentum is switching. It‚Äôs 4-3 in the third now, with Thiem leading by two sets to one. A quick once-over the other courts shows me that Nishikori is a break up on Gianessi, who levelled the match at 1-1 just a bit ago, whie Dimitrov leads Giron 6-2 6-4. I‚Äôd love to see old Grigzy do something, but at 30 his time to win a major has probably gone. In fairness, it must be pretty nauseating to still have the players you were meant to succeed winning stuff. ‚ÄúAndujar is indeed playing well,‚Äù says Jacques Derek Charlwood, ‚Äúbut puffing his cheeks with every point. One wonders if as you get older ( he is 35 versus Thiem‚Äôs 24) you regulate your first serves to save energy.‚Äù I‚Äôm sure you do lots to keep yourself fresh, but I‚Äôd wager that there‚Äôs nothing better for that than the game flowing with you - as it is now for Andujar. Andujar, who looks not unlike Mikel Arteta, is really piecing Thiem up here, covering his angles and picking his drops. In this latest game, he reads a forehand to this backhand corner, skids after it and carts a winner cross-court! Eventually, we get to deuce and Andujar raises break point; Thiem really needs a first serve, can‚Äôt find one, and then from the backhand corner, looks down the line and slashes wide! It looks a lot like we‚Äôll get a deciderhere, and the number four seed is in shtuck! Andujar 4-6 5-7 6-3 4-1 Thiem Three games in row for Andujar, who‚Äôs seeing it very nicely right about now. He carts a forehand pass cross-court, and that‚Äôs 3-1 to him, Thiem by two sets to one. ‚ÄúDropping our Hs would give us Enman and Ewitt, Enin, Ingiss and Antuchova,‚Äù notes Andrew Benton. ‚ÄúEven with their Hs restored, they‚Äôre all azbeens. Are there no H‚Äôs playing at top table these days?‚Äù I guess not, though I do laugh every time I hear someone call Hazza Kane or Maguire ‚ÄúHaitch.‚Äù I guess there‚Äôs this lad though. On court 14, Gianessi has won a breaker to four, levelling his match with Nishikori at one set all; on court seven, Dimitrov took the first set against Giron and we‚Äôre 3-3 in the second. So what‚Äôs going on on Chatrier?! Thiem swipes a forehand wide and Andujar, who‚Äôs playing really well now, is a break up in set four! Elsewhere, Fucsovics is serving for the match against Simon and Dimitrov is a set up on Giron. That was a really enjoyable match, and you‚Äôve got to admire Kecmanovic‚Äôs role in it. It‚Äôs been a tricky few years for him, but he was a very good junior and at 21 still has time to grow. But now it‚Äôs over! Kecmanovic reads a second serve and punches back a winner, then Evans goes long on a desperate and high forehand volley! Kecmanovic plays Moutet or Djere next; Evans, meanwhile, is imropving but has now gone out in round 1 in three of the last four majors. Good Evans. Again, his serve is dicey and from in front, he finds himself facing match point at 30-40; a gigantic forehand elicits an error, then an ace takes advantage to give him advantage. Kecmanovic, though, plays a terrific point ‚Äì in fairness, both players do ‚Äì swapping forehands and gets before a drop-shot brings us back to deuce. This is great stuff. Why have they changed the service marker on the telly scoreboard from a dot to a new paragraph mark? Kecmanovic has tightened, and flings a forehand long to give Evans 30-all before netting a backhand! And when Evans finds a deep return, he goes long! That‚Äôs four straight points for the British number 1, and he‚Äôs still in this! Kecmanovic 1-6 6-3 6-3 5-4 Evans Kecmanovic will now serve for the match, a circumstance that did not look likely when he lost the first set 6-1. Now then! Andujar struggles back and holds to take the third set! Thiem was a bit lax there, and as punishment he‚Äôll have to charge about for a bit longer. Andujar 4-6 5-7 6-3 Thiem Kecmanovic has only won nine matches so far this season, but he‚Äôs found his form now and a comfortable enough consolidation means that Evans will now serve to stay in the match at 2-5 in the fourth. Now then. Andujar breaks Thiem to love and is now serving for the third set ... and is 0-30 down. It takes a while, but Kecmanovic wins his third game in a row and now needs only two more for the win. Evans had loads of chances to level the set but couldn‚Äôt strong two points together once he‚Äôd won three to come back from 0-40. Kecmanovic 1-6 6-3 6-3 4-2 Evans She plays Vesnina or Govortsova next. Superb from Evans, roaring back from 0-40 to win three straight points, the last of them an ace ‚Äì his first of the set. He then hands Kecmanovic a chance by cracking into the net-cord, but the consequent pass is no good and we recline into a round of deuces. Brutal. Credit to Andujar, he‚Äôs not going away. He leads 3-2 in set three while, back in the women‚Äôs competition, Kvitova has bolted and leads Minnen 4-0 in the decider. Ach! Evans played his better stuff for a while but Kecmanovic is coming again, breaking back before speeding through a love hold! We‚Äôre back on serve in set four. Kecmanovic 1-6 6-3 6-3 3-2 Evans As such, here‚Äôs a piece on the unique joy of Murray, and here he is in Joy of Six: cool sports stats. Email! ‚ÄúI know it shouldn‚Äôt matter,‚Äù writes Simon McMahon, ‚Äúbut for me tennis just hasn‚Äôt been the same without Andy Murray. I know Evans, Edmund, Konta and Norrie are still carrying the flag for GB tennis, and it seems Dan is channeling his inner Andy today, but my wish is that we can see Andy himself win a few more matches at Grand Slams before retirement, maybe making the second week at Wimbledon with a signature Murray performance, battling back from two sets down, having to beat himself as much as his opponent, full of fist pumps, emotion, drama and of course some sublime shot-making. He‚Äôs earned the right to go out on his own terms I think. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve ever taken him for granted, but it could be a long time before we see his like again. Scotland‚Äôs greatest ever sportsperson? I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs in the top one.‚Äù I feel you ‚Äì I can‚Äôt think of many individual sportsfolk I‚Äôve loved as much as Murray, who is one of the most obviously top blokes I‚Äôve never met. I can‚Äôt think of many Scots anywhere near him ‚Äì Alan Wells is one, Law, Dalglish and Rose Reilly others. I‚Äôve got a personal soft spot for Jojo Calderwood, but yeah, I‚Äôd have Muzz, for the martchplaying but also for the man. Evans is breathing hard - it‚Äôs warm out there - as he works his arse off for the second break. He gets a chance too, but Kecmanovic finds a first serve-forehand combo that removes the opportunity, and following a further succession of deuces, closes out the game to get on the board in set three. Kecmanovic 1-6 6-3 6-3 0-2 Evans On Lenglen, Kvitova has taken the breaker so she and Minnen ‚Äì a Belgian qualifier ‚Äì will play a decider. Minnen 7-6(3) (5)5-7 Kvitova Evans shanks a return that gives Kecmanovic deuce and naturally abuses the court with some choice Anglo-Saxon; quite right too. He‚Äôs struggling to get free points on his serve here, but he‚Äôs fighting like Chelsea and Man City fans in Oporto. Eventually, it pays off too, a second serve out wide cleaned up with a ferocious forehand. This is a really fun match now. Kecmanovic 1-6 6-3 6-3 0-2 Evans Elsewhere, Minnen leads Kvitova, the number 11 seed, 7-6; they‚Äôre playing a breaker in set two. Fucsovics, meanwhile, leads Simon 6-4 6-1 and Pella is sorting Galan 6-3 7-6(4). Thiem closes out the second set, and now leads Andujar 6-4 7-5. Evans changes from blue to green, which should sort things ... and, for now, it has! He glides a backhand return cross-court and when Kecmanovic‚Äôs riposte clips the net cord, he shovels a winner into the corner. If these two can hit a vein at the same time, the conclusion of this match could be great. Kecmanovic 1-6 6-3 6-3 0-1 Evans Less surprising is what happens on Chatrier, Thiem turning it up to break to love. He‚Äôll now serve for the set (again). This is superb from Kecmanovic! Just as Evans thinks he found himself again, he‚Äôs broken again, and that‚Äôs 2-1 to the Serb! Kecmanovic 1-6 6-3 6-3 Evans Well who saw that coming? From 30-0 up, Thiem allows Andujar back into the game and it costs him a break! We‚Äôre back on serve in set two! Andujar 4-6 5-5 Thiem Excellent from Evans, coming in behind a telling forehand to despatch a high backhand volley at the net; that gives him two break points, and a wild, swiped backhand keeps the set alive. Kecmanovic 1-6 6-3 5-3 Evans Meanwhile, on Chatrier, Thiem is serving for 2-0; Andujar has never won a match from 0-2 down. He gets there in the end! Kecmanovic is splattering Evans‚Äô serve at the moment, and after change of ends, he‚Äôll rely on his own to go 2-1 in front. Kecmanovic 1-6 6-3 5-2 Evans Thanks John. Evans and Kecmanovic are wrestling through a brutal game that Evans must win; the longer it goes, the more that is so. Kecmanovic has the latest of various advantages ... and Evans saves break point number seven with a large forehand and put-away. And with that, it‚Äôs back to Daniel with Evans v Kecmanovic so finely poised. It‚Äôs a tad windy in Paris, and Evans continues to put up a fight against Kecmanovic‚Äôs serve. He has a break point at deuce but crashes his shot into the net. Then he lands another with a smash. He can‚Äôt keep the ball in on the next one so back to deuce it goes. Then comes another, and Evans continues to chat to himself. Then comes a huge rally, and Evans slowly moves his opponent around the court to break back to 2-4. Now he must serve this one out. Kecmanovic breaks straight back, unaffected by Evans‚Äô mini-revival, he‚Äôs 4-1 on up on the Brit and looks assured of the third set. Evans is still living, and he breaks back, charging from the back of the court to leather a winner. It‚Äôs still 1-3 in the third but he has hope. His problem is that he is having to do most of his playing from the very back of the court. Going with serve between Thiem and Andujar on Philippe Chatrier. It‚Äôs a most even contest. There‚Äôs a Serbian contingent roaring on Kecmanovic, but nobody roaring on Dan Evans the plucky Brit. He‚Äôs still doing plenty of talking to himself. And more rude words. He‚Äôs down 3-0 and in deep trouble. Kecmanovic serves out to get 2-0 up and now Evans is swearing at the umpire, complaining that people are being let into the court while he is serving. He used the f-word. Naughty boy, and he‚Äôs getting a spanking here. Dan Evans throwing a wobbler? He is interrupted by a voice from outside the court as he goes to serve, catches the ball. ‚ÄúAstonishing, mate, astonishing,‚Äù he shouts at persons unknown. And Kecmanovic has a run on him, breaking in the very first game of the third set. Some big names playing in tonight‚Äôs inaugural evening session. Thiem serves out, and wins the first set 6-4, walloping a forehand winner. Kecmanovic lands himself three set points with some excellent play, and eventually serves to love. 1-6 6-3 now, and Evans has trouble on his hands. Kecmanovic, at 5-2 up, attempts to break Evans but the Englishman forces him to serve to level the sets. Evans double faults and leads 40-30, only to win the game with a great forehand. Thiem has control of the first set against Andujar as he goes 5-3 up. His opponent seems flustered; his good play is going unrewarded. He holds the next one and lands his first ace in the process. Thiem will serve out the set. Some resistance from Evans, real speed around the court as he tries to stop Kecmanovic breaking again, and he holds to take it back 2-4 in the second set. A Tim Henman-style punch of the air, but without the blowing on the fingers. Some actualit√©. It goes 4-1 to Kecmanovic with a good hold of serve. Evans needs to start picking things back up or he will be in trouble in the third set, too. Hello there, here for the next hour. Andujar just saved six break points from Thiem, and it‚Äôs 2-3 to the Frenchman. Evans just got one back, so it‚Äôs 1-3 in the second set with Kecmanovic. Right, I‚Äôm away for some fress. John Brewin with narrate you through the next little bit. Kecmanovic is reading Evans now, chasing down his drops and generally dominating ‚Äì this is boiling up nicely. Kecmanovic 1-6 3-0 Evans Thiem is such a beautiful mover, and already Andujar is puffing out his cheeks in resignation. But 1-3 and break point down, he runs around a forehand to drive a winner down the line; this game has been going nearly six minutes now, the majority of it Andujar saving break points, and we‚Äôve now been going 11 minutes. Andujar 1-3 Thiem Superb from Kecmanovic, who holds then reads an Evans drop for 0-30 before, on break point, swiping a backhand winner cross-court! Do we got ourselves a ball-game? Kecmanovic 1-6 2-0 Evans Kecmanovic is making a game of the games now, but he‚Äôs still getting absolutely served; Evans, who beat Djokovic at Monte Carlo last month, is looking lovely and takes the first set in short order. Kecmanovic 1-6 Evans Back on Chatrier, Andujar had a break-back point against Thiem but failed to convert; he‚Äôs on the baord, though, 2-1 down in set one. Kecmanovic fights hard in the sixth game of the match and he‚Äôs in it now, a banging forehand down the line resolving a succession of deuces. Kecmanovic 1-5 Evans On court seven, Roberto Bautista Agut ‚Äì the number 11 seed ‚Äì is underway. If he‚Äôd played in the 80s or 90s he might‚Äôve won one of these in the way that Muster, Bruguera, Gomez, Moya and Kafelnikov all did. But here we are. He trials Vilella Martinez 4-3 on serve. Meanwhile, on Chatrier, a dominant first game from Thiem sees him break Andujar. Evans has got into stride quickly here and looks to have Kecmanovic‚Äôs number. There‚Äôs not much pop on the Serb‚Äôs serve which is allowing yerman to climb right into points, and this first set is almost over. Kecmanovic 0-4 Evans Fognini has beaten Barrera 4,1 and 4. The number 27 seed plays Simon or, more likely, Fucsovics next. Those two tussle on Mathieu presently; Kovinivic has done for Burel 6-3 7-6(8) and must now contemplate Osaka. Anyhow, while I was busy wondering what my girlfriend wife would say if I publicly challenged her ability to have it, Evans was busy holding and breaking. Kecmanovic 0-2 Evans Just last week, Thiem noted that living in a bubble has helped Evans, given he‚Äôs previously struggled with the demands of the professional athlete‚Äôs lifestyle; Evans was having none of it, retorting that he‚Äôd sorted himself well before the pandemic started. ‚ÄúI must be out partying a lot, yeah,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve done all right outside of the bubble as well. I must have improved a lot inside it for him to say that. I travel with my girlfriend every week. It‚Äôs not like you can go out partying with your girlfriend every week. It‚Äôs not that I was on my own and single and going nuts when there weren‚Äôt bubbles. It‚Äôs a strange comment, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù Evans and Kecmanovic are knocking up.... Next on Chatrier: the number four seed and defeated finalist in 2018 and 2019, Dominic Thiem, begins his next assault on the trophy. He meets Pablo Andujar. A couple more results: in the men‚Äôs competition, Carreno Busta has rinsed Gombos 3,4, and 3, whole in the women‚Äôs, Tomljanovic has sorted Kozlova 2 and 4. Osaka hasn‚Äôt played a lot lately but she looked pretty good today. I don‚Äôt think her footwork is good enough to win here ‚Äì yet ‚Äì but her ball-striking was on-point and the relative closeness of the match is down to how well Tig played. Osaka meets Bogdan next. Osaka hollers a come on as she makes 4-2 in the breaker ‚Äì the ball makes such a lush thump off the middle of her forehand. An error from Tig quickly gives her 5-2 ... but consecutive unforced errors and we‚Äôre back on serve. Briefly. Here ceom two more match points.... Next on court six, we‚Äôve got Dan Evans, the British number one, against Minomir Kecmanovic. She meets Burel or Kovinivic next; Kovinivic won the first set 6-3 and it‚Äôs 2-2 in the second. Tig is competing hard here, but with a point for a breaker clips over another second serve of questionable power and Osaka quickly punishes. She may well regret that ... but no! A forehand clattered down the line saves the match point that follows, and a fine kicker helps her raise advantage, ceded when an inside-out forehand drops marginally wide ... but what a lob she finds when in front the next time! Tig 4-6 6-6 Osaka Fognini has taken that second set against Barrere to lead 6-4 6-1 1-0 (with a break). On court six, Badosa and Davis are playing a breaker in a topsy-turvy second set; Badosa won the first. But look at Kalinina! She reels off two points in short order and it turns out you can‚Äôt loz the first five games of a set and expect to win. She meets Collins or Wang next; Wang has just levelled the match at one set all. ...and Kerber saves it with a glorious backhand slice drop-shot! Egalit√©! Osaka is whacking it hard now, but Tig is just about sticking with her, while Kalinina finds a devastating forehand to give herself 30-0 against Kerber; she‚Äôs nearly there. Back to Chatrier, Tig misses a huge chance with a half-court volley that would‚Äôve got her 15-30; seconds later, the game has gone and Osaka, 5-4 up in the second, needs just one more. Kerber, meanwhile, soon makes 30-all; Kalinina steps on the spot to try and shake her tightness, then serves a double. Eesh. She makes deuce though, then hits through the ball beautifully to raise match point... Fognini is bolting; the number 27 seed came from behind to take the first set of Barrere, but now leads 4-1 in the second. A monstrous forehand down the line breaks Kalinina to 15; it‚Äôs taken a while but Kerber is motoring. Still, the qualifier will have one more chance to eject her before we‚Äôre back on serve ‚Äì but first, Kerber must hold. Kalinina 6-2 5-3 Kerber Tig is hanging in there well, but Osaka holds for 3-2, while Kerber has won a second game and Kalinina will now serve for the match a second time. At change of ends, she puts a towel over her head to get into the correct frame of mind. Pablo Carreno Busta, the number 12 seed and a clay-court specialist, has taken set two against Norbert Gombos; he now leads 6-3 6-4 0-1. Kerber has won a game! Kalinina now leads 6-2 5-1. Some reading on Edberg. Goodness me, Tig just dispensed the weakest second serve I‚Äôve ever seen, short, skipping up off the clay, and duly marmalised by Osaka. In commentary, they reckon Sampras had the best second-serve in men‚Äôs history ‚Äì shout from me for Edberg‚Äôs kicker ‚Äì and Durie mentions Barty in the women‚Äôs game. Anyhow, Tig survives a break point to hold. Tig 4-6 2-2 It took a while, but Fognini has fought back to take the first set from Barrere, 6-4; Kalinina now leads Kerber ‚Äì who‚Äôs won every major but this one ‚Äì 6-2 4-0. Tossing those opportunities has not not gone down well with Osaka, who powers through a break to love, seizing the first set and sealing it with a colossal forehand racing forward. Tig 4-6 Osaka Updates from the women‚Äôs side: Kozlova 2-6 Tomljanovic, Cocciaretto 1-6 2-3 Bogdan, Collins 6-2 1-1 Wang Have a look! Kalinina breaks Kerber in the first game of the second set and quickly consolidates, while a double fault helps Tig earn a break-back point; Osaka impatiently whips a forehand long, and we‚Äôre back on serve! Tig 4-5 Osaka Tig saves three set points, forcing Osaka to serve for the first set, while Badosa has taken hers against Davis, 6-2. When they‚Äôre done on court six, Dan Evans will have a go; he plays the Serb, Miomir Kecmanoviƒá. Kerber couldn‚Äôt do enough, and after a succession of deuces during which she saved a set point with a net cord, Kalinina comes through 6-2. Carreno Busta, the number 12 seed, has rinsed through the first set against Gombos 6-3 and now trails 0-1 in the second, on serve; I‚Äôm not quite sure how they‚Äôve managed 10 games so quickly, but they have. By way of comparison, Barrere leads Fognini 3-2, still with the break he took early doors. Osaka isn‚Äôt a natural mover on clay but she‚Äôs hitting it very nicely indeed, especially with feet planted. She‚Äôs won 15 out of 16 on serve, and her second straight love-game leaves her close to the first set. Tig 2-5 Osaka Yeah, time‚Äôs up. Kerber has roused herself to claw back a break. It might not save this set for her, but if she maintains her current level, she‚Äôll be reet. Kalinina 5-2 Kerber Out of the corner of my eye, I‚Äôm also watching Paula Badosa, the number 33 seed, playing Lauren Davis; Badosa is a Manhattan-born Spaniard and won the girls‚Äô singles in 2015. She‚Äôs looking good out there, leading 4-2. Elsewhere, Bogdan has taken the first set against Cocciaretto, 6-1; Fognini is a break down to Barrere; and Tomljanovic leads Kozlova 3-0. It‚Äôs all going wrong for Kerber, who now trails Kalinina 5-0. Under an umbrella ‚Äì what a lovely sight that is ‚Äì she takes some deep breaths while having a serious word with herself. Yeah, Osaka is grooving, greeting a decent first serve with a belter of a cross-court return to raise break point. But Tig yanks her in and Osaka stutter-slides in to botch a slice of her own ... but no matter. She‚Äôs piecing Tig up here, and a booming forehand nails her fourth advantage. Tig 0-2 Osaka I‚Äôm also watching Angelique Kerber, who‚Äôs not a great clay artist and is 0-2 down to Anhelina Kalinina, the qualifer. Meanwhile, on Chatrier, Jo Durie discusses how brilliant the current standard of women‚Äôs tennis is, and she‚Äôs right. I suppose I might slightly disagree, she‚Äôll be devo‚Äôd to learn, because there‚Äôs no dominant champion at the peak of their powers. Perhaps Osaka will be become that, but otherwise there are so many who are so good, and when you stick on a match you‚Äôve not a clue what‚Äôs going to happen, and that‚Äôs a beautiful thing. I‚Äôm really looking forward to seeing the improvements Osaka has made on clay, and she saves a break point in the opening game of the match. Tig 0-1 Osaka. On Chatrier, Naomi Osaka will be underway in une minute. Here‚Äôs Tumaini Carayol on her big call. Well, on the show courts - there‚Äôs plenty else besides. Chatrier Tig v Osaka [2] Andujar v Thiem [4] Azarenka [15] v Kuznetsova Tsitsipas [5] v Chardy Lenglen Fognini [27] v Barrere Minnen [Q] v Kvitova [11] Konjuh [Q] v Sabalneka [3] Zverev [6] v Otte [Q] Mathieu Burel v Kovinivic Fucsovics v Simon Moutet v Djere Dodin v Keys [23] It‚Äôs been an enervating, affirming winter slog, but we made it, and with the first ball tossed this morning, the summer of sport ‚Äì the ridiculous summer of sport ‚Äì is upon us. And you can be absolutely certain that we‚Äôll take it. Most importantly, each of the show courts will house up to 1000 fans a day for each of the first 10 days ‚Äì and hopefully more thereafter. They, like the rest of us, will be wondering whether this, finally, is the year that Rafael Nadal finally runs out of road; Novak Djokovic, Dominic Thiem, Stefanos Tsitsipas and Daniil Medvedev will be hoping so, but it will only be a hope. Meanwhile and as has become the fashion ‚Äì sorry, le mode ‚Äì no one has a clue what‚Äôll happen in the women‚Äôs side. Iga Swiatek is the defending champion and if she hits a vein she‚Äôll be hard to stop, but there are just so many others who might do likewise that anyone who thinks they know is lying.

Out it fizzed, and Adam Lyth guided the ball off his hip and into the waiting hands of Luke Wells at leg slip. The first ‚ÄúOh Lanky Lanky‚Äù since 2019 trilled over Old Trafford as Lyth stalked towards the dressing room.</p> <p>Seven overs later, the penultimate of the day, Saqib Mahmood hurtled in off his long, long run and pinned Tom Kohler-Cadmore in front of the stumps. Mahmood punched the air while Kohler-Cadmore slumped back off, followed shortly afterwards by a clatter that sounded very much like a bat being thumped repeatedly against a wall.</p> <p>Their frustration was understandable: Kohler-Cadmore and Lyth had batted for 38 of the 47 overs <strong>Yorkshire </strong>had to survive in the day, risking sending the masses into a stupor with their dedication and application to the task at hand: batting for the rest of Saturday and the whole of Sunday. They so nearly did it.</p> <p>It was Josh Bohannon, with the help of Danny Lamb, who had set Lancashire up for the kill, moving to the second Championship century of his career and his first Roses hundred slow-quick-slow ‚Äì which was just what was needed. Wickets came as Lancashire upped the ante before the declaration, but by then the lead was 350.</p> <p>Yorkshire‚Äôs woes won‚Äôt have been helped by <strong>Northamptonshire</strong>‚Äôs progress down at Hove. With a win in touching distance, they will leapfrog Yorkshire to second place in Division Two. Despite a game second innings by <strong>Sussex</strong>, which included a hundred by Tom Haines and 95 for Ben Brown as well as five wickets for Simon Kerrigan, Northants were set just 218 to win. By stumps, they needed only 87 more with eight wickets in hand.</p> <p><strong>Essex</strong> beat <strong>Durham</strong> by 195 runs in an lbw-fest at The Riverside after Peter Siddle and Jamie Porter made mincemeat of their middle and late order. Durham lost five for 38 as the sun slipped down the sky, Alex Lees working hard for his 48. When Jack Burnham became the 19th player to be given out lbw, it was a record in an English first-class match.</p> <p>Daniel Moriarty took his fourth five-wicket haul of his short first-class career, bowling <strong>Gloucestershire</strong> into a hole at The Oval. The <strong>Surrey</strong> bowler took six for 60, and Amar Virdi three for 46, in the first innings, as Gloucestershire were bundled out for 158, with only Miles Hammond in a four-hour 77 providing any bulk to the batting.</p> <p>Following on, meanwhile, Hammond found himself at the crease sooner than he might have hoped and was unbeaten again on 38 at the close, but Gloucester are still 191 behind with just five wickets left.</p> <p>Career-best bowling from Dillon Pennington gave <strong>Worcestershire</strong> the upper hand at New Road. Pennington snaffled four for 44 in the first innings then three for 25 in the next as <strong>Derbyshire</strong> were invited to follow on and crumbled.</p> <p><strong>Leicestershire</strong> need an unlikely 303 to win against <strong>Middlesex</strong> on a turning pitch. Chris Wright had whistled through Middlesex earlier with six for 48.</p> <p>An intriguing final last day lies in wait at Edgbaston as <strong>Warwickshire</strong> and <strong>Nottinghamshire </strong>went nose to nose. Fifties for Michael Burgess and Will Rhodes inched Warwickshire to a lead of 245 by stumps.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60b348698f088d8c3178d773\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-05-30T09:22:53.974Z\">10.22am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>A most beautiful May morning, </strong>the sky milky-eyed blue, the air full of blossom and Paul Allot in his shorts.

Well played Yorkshire. Scores to follow. One over left till tea at Old Trafford. Notts are still five down at Edgbaston, James 18, Moores 21. Another 187 needed if they dare. While Leicestershire are down to a two-figure target. Harris 164, Ackermann 79, the target 99. Luke Wells has a go from the James Anderson end, all long legs and gangly arms. Can he befuddle them with his off-beat leg-breaks as tea approaches? A mini epic at Old Trafford: Bess and Duke v Livingstone and Parkinson. Yorkshire careful, ever so careful. Duke got off the mark to his 39th ball after 49 minutes on 0, during which he seemed completely unbothered by the score. He and Bess patiently press forward. And again. And again. 40 overs left. Harry Duke playing a bravado 28-ball 0. The Foxes are sprinting towards the finish line. Harris has moved to 152, Acermann to 67 and neither Bamber nor Helm nor Andersson nor Walallawita not Hollman nor Gubbins can find an answer. The third-wickset partnership 177. I thought Notts had forgotten how to Notts-up. Seems I was wrong. Mullaney swings to square leg and Rob Yates accepts gratefully. Notts 94-5, James and Moores the men in. A drop! Livingstone at first slip lets Bess through his fingers. Yorkshire 186-6. Forty-four and a half overs left. Some justifiable Surrey crowing. A leg-side stumping! Clarke done by Hannon-Dalby and Burgess for 20. Notts 80-4, need 229 for win. The see-saw has swung.... as it has here! Parkinson sprints over to Livingstone for a hug as Brook props forward and is hit full on the boot. The finger rises. Yorkshire 180-6. Took the chance for a little sun worship in the stands at lunchtime and was struck suddenly by the theatricality of it all when the players came back out. First the umpires marched in unison onto the field in matching black trousers and wide-brimmed hats. Then the Lancashire fielders, rag-tag, fresh from an upper east side rumble; then finally the two Yorkshire batsmen, down the shaded metal staircase into the bright sunlight. It‚Äôs just something you don‚Äôt normally see from the press box. Parkinson takes a turn from the Brian Statham End. What I enjoy most at the end of his bowling action is the little shuffle of expectation, hands a-cock, like a tap-dancer mid-shuffle. And that‚Äôs fifty for Harry Brook, 104 balls, five fours. Well played! If he can be there at the end, he‚Äôll have made his name in a county career that hasn‚Äôt yet quite flowered. A century for Marcus Harris, his second for Leicestershire, and 55 for Colin Ackermann defies the sceptics. At 198-2, they are more than half way there: 180 to win. Notts lose Duckett and Slater within an over. My spider senses are a-tingling. Notts 57-3, wickets for Bresnan, Norwell and Briggs. Tom Bailey takes the new ball and - hey presto - three balls later George Hill‚Äôs off stump takes a turn for the worse. Worse yet, Saqib Mahmood takes over from Parkinson at the James Anderson end. Yorkshire 152-5. Surrey 473 beat Gloucestershire 158 and 268 Tattersall left high and dry on 86! Moriarty takes his second wicket of the innings, and eighth of the match. Virdi finishes with six in the match. Gloucestershire lose their unbeaten record and Surrey win the second game! Gloucestershire remain top of Group 2 with 107, Somerset on their tails 104, Surrey third 101 (but having played one extra game). Group One Riverside: ESSEX 182 and 301 BEAT DURHAM 99 and 189 by 195 runs Edgbaston: Warwickshire 341 and 264 v Nottinghamshire 297 and 34-1 New Road: Worcestershire 421 beat Derbyshire 270 and 128 by an innings and 23 runs. Group Two Grace Road: Leicestershire 136 and 167-2 Middlesex 295 and 218 all out Leicestershire need 211 to win The Oval: Surrey 473 all out v Gloucestershire 158 and 260-9* Group Three Old Trafford: Lancashire 509-9dec v Yorkshire 159 and 144-4 Hove: Northants 256 and 218-7 BEAT Sussex 175 and 298 by seven wicket *still playing A quietly impressive 50 stand between Brook and Hill, as Hill pushes through the off side. That‚Äôs lunch! Fabulous bowling by Mahmood but well batted Yorkies. Lancashire are just three overs away from taking the new ball. Some thoughts around that the press box that the ball might not be spinning as much because the pitch is so abrasive that the ball has gone soft. Or maybe it‚Äôs the weather. Or maybe something quite else. To be honest, it is all still a mystery. The Yorkshire Post points out that Tattersall was dropped by Yorkshire for not scoring enough runs... Oh bother, Hass is out for two. Notts 16-1. One last fizz for Parkinson before lunch here at OT, four men close enough to examine Hill‚Äôs ear. Virdi has taken one more at The Oval, Tattersall STILL there, 69 not out, but Gloucestershire on the crumble of the cliff. And well done Leicestershire! Harris and Ackermann still there, 157-2. Ah! While I was gazing at the summer fixtures and pondering July, Warwickshire were all out. Notts set 309 to win with England-bound Haseeb Hameed at the crease. Currently 6-0. In days of yore (April) I‚Äôd have said Notts had not a chance, but now.... they‚Äôll do it by tea! Four wickets for Fletcher; Burgess 80, Briggs 50. A bowling change at Old Trafford, where the Yorkies had started to look unseasonably comfortable. Liam Livingstone replaces Parkinson after a brief but fruitless flurry from the BS end; and Luke Wood replaces Danny Lamb at the JA end. At The Oval, Amar Virdi snags his third wicket, Matt Taylor for 12. Jonny Tattersall holding out for his adopted team, 51 not out. Northants 256 and 218-7 beat Sussex 175 and 298 This makes it very tasty! More runs for Saif Zaib, 47; Rob Keogh, 60. Northants confirmed in third place in Group 3 with 97 points. Northants trilling merrily on their way - just 19 needed now; while Warwickshire bat on - 250-7 - a lead of 294. Bat on till 2.30 before the declaration? Worcestershire 421 beat Derbyshire 270 and 128 by an innings and 23 runs. Pennington finishes with five - and nine in the match. Only three batsmen in double figures for Derbyshire in a sorry second innings. Just the ticket. Parky replaces Tom Bailey at the Brian Statham End. Meanwhile, Gloucestershire are crumbling, losing their glue, Hammond, to Moriarty for 45 before Smith bowled by Joverton for one. At 148-7, they need 167 to make Surrey bat again. A forlorn hope. Should they lose, Lancashire will be the only team in the Championship with an unbeaten record. The off stump The middle stump... Another for Mahmood! This time it moves away, away and ping the off stump flies! Beautifull. Yorkshire 92-4. A beauty from Saqib Mahmood! A fast inswinger that plucks Fraine‚Äôs middle stump and sends it flying. Fraine turns his bat the wrong way round and plods off, the second time in the match he‚Äôs had an unplayable ball from Mahmood. Yorkshire 87-3. That man Pennington again! Fourth of the innings, eighth of the match. Derbyshire 188-8, still 33 behind Leicestershire lose their first wicket of the day and it is Sam Evans, who gives John Simpsom some catching practise. Tom Helm pockets his first of the innings and Leics are 85-2. A wicket too soon. A fizzing opening ball from Mahmood which Fraine leaves with an eye-brow raising boldness. The players are out, Patterson pressing forward, forward, forward with his bat as he walks. Mahmood has the ball from the James Anderson end. It has just been pointed out to me that Northants will NOT leap on top of Yorkshire if they win... apologies. If Yorks lose today they will have 99 points; and if Northants win they will have 97. We know Jimmy Anderson would have preferred to take his 1000th wicket at the Roses match, but needs must. Vic over a morning coffee: heaven. Group One Riverside: ESSEX 182 and 301 BEAT DURHAM 99 and 189 by 195 runs Edgbaston: Warwickshire 341 all out and 201-6 v Nottinghamshire 297 New Road: Worcestershire 421 all out v Derbyshire 270 and 112-6 Group Two Grace Road: Leicestershire 136 and 75-1 Middlesex 295 and 218 all out Leicestershire need 303 to win The Oval: Surrey 473 all out v Gloucestershire 158 and 124-5 Group Three Old Trafford: Lancashire 509-9dec v Yorkshire 159 and 85-2 Hove: Sussex 175 and 298 v Northants 256 and 131-2 Northants need 87 to win His shadow lolling out to the right, a white flannel tucked into the waistband of his trousers and his cropped hair gleaming in the sun, Lancashire‚Äôs Matt Parkinson ripped a ball into the rough. Out it fizzed, and Adam Lyth guided the ball off his hip and into the waiting hands of Luke Wells at leg slip. The first ‚ÄúOh Lanky Lanky‚Äù since 2019 trilled over Old Trafford as Lyth stalked towards the dressing room. Seven overs later, the penultimate of the day, Saqib Mahmood hurtled in off his long, long run and pinned Tom Kohler-Cadmore in front of the stumps. Mahmood punched the air while Kohler-Cadmore slumped back off, followed shortly afterwards by a clatter that sounded very much like a bat being thumped repeatedly against a wall. Their frustration was understandable: Kohler-Cadmore and Lyth had batted for 38 of the 47 overs Yorkshire had to survive in the day, risking sending the masses into a stupor with their dedication and application to the task at hand: batting for the rest of Saturday and the whole of Sunday. They so nearly did it. It was Josh Bohannon, with the help of Danny Lamb, who had set Lancashire up for the kill, moving to the second Championship century of his career and his first Roses hundred slow-quick-slow ‚Äì which was just what was needed. Wickets came as Lancashire upped the ante before the declaration, but by then the lead was 350. Yorkshire‚Äôs woes won‚Äôt have been helped by Northamptonshire‚Äôs progress down at Hove. With a win in touching distance, they will leapfrog Yorkshire to second place in Division Two. Despite a game second innings by Sussex, which included a hundred by Tom Haines and 95 for Ben Brown as well as five wickets for Simon Kerrigan, Northants were set just 218 to win. By stumps, they needed only 87 more with eight wickets in hand. Essex beat Durham by 195 runs in an lbw-fest at The Riverside after Peter Siddle and Jamie Porter made mincemeat of their middle and late order. Durham lost five for 38 as the sun slipped down the sky, Alex Lees working hard for his 48. When Jack Burnham became the 19th player to be given out lbw, it was a record in an English first-class match. Daniel Moriarty took his fourth five-wicket haul of his short first-class career, bowling Gloucestershire into a hole at The Oval. The Surrey bowler took six for 60, and Amar Virdi three for 46, in the first innings, as Gloucestershire were bundled out for 158, with only Miles Hammond in a four-hour 77 providing any bulk to the batting. Following on, meanwhile, Hammond found himself at the crease sooner than he might have hoped and was unbeaten again on 38 at the close, but Gloucester are still 191 behind with just five wickets left. Career-best bowling from Dillon Pennington gave Worcestershire the upper hand at New Road. Pennington snaffled four for 44 in the first innings then three for 25 in the next as Derbyshire were invited to follow on and crumbled. Leicestershire need an unlikely 303 to win against Middlesex on a turning pitch. Chris Wright had whistled through Middlesex earlier with six for 48. An intriguing final last day lies in wait at Edgbaston as Warwickshire and Nottinghamshire went nose to nose. Fifties for Michael Burgess and Will Rhodes inched Warwickshire to a lead of 245 by stumps. A most beautiful May morning, the sky milky-eyed blue, the air full of blossom and Paul Allot in his shorts. Here at Old Trafford, a thriller awaits as Yorkshire attempt to bat out the day and Lancashire, with Parky whirling and Mahmood charging, press for the kill. Elsewhere, Northants should knock off the runs this morning; Leicester have to defy the might of Middlesex; at The Oval Miles Hammond lies between Surrey and victory; Worcestershire are on course to roll-over Derbyshire and a close match awaits at Edgbaston.","charCount":"12668","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/tanyaaldred\">Tanya Aldred</a> at Old Trafford"},{"headline":"Work is where your laptop is: meet the globetrotting digital nomads ","standfirst":"<p>Worldwide shift to flexible and home working in pandemic has led to rise of new kind of backpacker</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/may/30/home-working-drives-demand-shoffice-space-uk-gardens-shed-office\">Home working drives demand for ‚Äòshoffice‚Äô space in UK gardens</a></li></ul>","trailText":"Worldwide shift to flexible and home working in pandemic has led to rise of new kind of backpacker","byline":"Julia Kollewe","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"76add6d6a1317fc4d03b419b432bfe198a6f63ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76add6d6a1317fc4d03b419b432bfe198a6f63ff/803_299_1929_1159/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jason Melton and Chanin Kaye from Seattle, six months into a seven-year Latin American trip.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jason Melton and Chanin Kaye from Seattle, six months into a seven-year Latin American trip.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Melton</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Samantha Scott does not miss her daily commutes in London, particularly ‚Äúthe dread of having to wake up and get on the tube, and heading into work sweaty and flustered.

After more than a year working from kitchen tables, sofas or spare bedrooms, many Britons are looking to carve out a quiet workspace in the loft or in their garden. Jules Carluccio, who works in local government, is one of the millions of workers who has not been back to her usual workplace since last spring. In anticipation of permanent home working she decided to splash out on a ‚Äúshoffice‚Äù. The new workspace in her Bedfordshire garden is much more than a humble garden shed. At more than 8 sq metres, the wood, metal and glass structure comes complete with a canopied seating area and mains electricity. It did not come cheap at ¬£17,500. ‚ÄúIt was a big [financial] commitment, but I weighed it up,‚Äù Carluccio said. ‚ÄúI looked at how long I would be staying at the property, how long I would be in my job, and also the kinds of uses I wanted from it.‚Äù More than a third (38%) of UK workers worked from home in mid-May, accordingto data from the Office for National Statistics. Few office-based staff expect to go back to their desk for five days a week. Earlier this month, the accountancy firm EY became the latest company to tell employees they will be expected to work from home for at least two days a week, even after coronavirus restrictions are lifted. Its 17,000 staff will move to a ‚Äúhybrid working model‚Äù, combining home working with the office, as well as client visits. Many other large office occupiers plan to adopt hybrid working, to cut office costs as much as pleasing staff. These staff need somewhere to work on the days when they are not required to be at their desk. The booming demand for home offices pushed the company Smart Garden Rooms, Offices &amp; Studios to its best-ever month in April, when it notched up ¬£750,000 of sales, more than double its monthly average. Since reopening last May, the Suffolk-based firm has scarcely been able to build its garden offices quickly enough to keep up with demand, despite taking on a third more staff. Its managing director, Matt Moss, said: ‚ÄúPeople don‚Äôt spend ¬£20,000 on a garden room on a whim, thinking I might be able to work from home going forward.

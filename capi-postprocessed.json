I have reservations – boxes in the middle of the two tiers, sending the upper deck further from the action, less sun for those so inclined – but the view from the bottom looks so much better. Ultimately, you’ve got to credit the MCC in that every single ground improvement has been an absolute belter, on its own and as part of the whole. One minor tragedy, though, is the loss of the greatest toilets in the world – those were in the Warner, and featured a window which afforded members a view of the middle. It’s still raining, but that’s sort of good news. It means we should have play through all five days – and, as per the below, prospect of cricket is better than no cricket – on top of which, for those that can it’s worth investigating tickets for Sunday because there may be some. Tim Southee had a chat with Sky, discussing the inswinger he’s found and with which he dismissed Zak Crawley yesterday. It’s incredible really – how good he’s been without one – and how watching James Anderson can leave one taking such behaviour for granted “If the first hour is crucial, yet is lost to rain, does that hour remain crucial or does the next one take on that role?” wonders Phil Withall. “Does time lose its meaning if nothing happens during it or does it become more valuable for that reason?

Their crimes can make uncomfortable reading, and rightly so. We meet Tony, a serial killer who decapitated his first victim; Gabriel, who stabbed a complete stranger in a north London cafe; Zahra, who enjoyed setting fire to herself (and other people) and Ian, who sexually abused his two young sons. If this book were a tabloid article, these deeds would serve only as the lurid headlines; words intended to draw us in, to play on our endless, quiet fascination with the murderous and the macabre. Perhaps this fascination stems from an increasing desensitisation, or perhaps it’s a strange sense of collective responsibility for the dark fruit of our landscape, and the headlines provide us with a checkpoint of accountability. But beyond the headlines, and within these pages, lies the true narrative of the patients and alongside them, the calming presence of Adshead herself. “Some things I will ask you to look at will be hard to unsee,” she writes. “But I know from my own experience that gaining insight … is transformative, and I will be by your side.” It is this constant and reassuring voice, a voice not hesitant to admit to its own occasional missteps and misjudgments, that makes the book so valuable and absorbing.</p> <p>Self-doubt is perhaps the most essential medical qualification of all and, as a clinician, Adshead questions her own prejudice at several points during the stories, challenging her readers to do the same. The templates from which we often work – the dutiful compliance of an Asian daughter, the moral standing of a blustering, golf-playing GP, what a child sex offender looks like – all provide a rich and dangerous harvest. Even more worryingly, these prejudices can travel beyond our subconscious and into misdiagnoses, sentencing and resources. Several of Adshead’s stories, for example, illustrate society’s preference to explain away female violence as a result of trauma (despite the vast majority of the very many female victims of trauma never becoming violent) and that assumption might lead to different care plans or the absence of certain therapies being offered.. The book also recalls an occasion when a female patient became so enraged at her male therapist that she began shouting and growling, and taking chunks out of his office door with a sharp object. Adshead, a witness to this fury and “with a speed fuelled by cowardice”, leapt into a hall cupboard and locked herself inside. She questioned, afterwards, whether she would have been more likely to intervene if the patient had been male. Having gone through an identical experience with a laundry cupboard on a high dependency unit, I now question myself too. Perhaps the idea of female violence is so distasteful to us as a society that it is easier just to look away.</p> <p>In contrast, images of motherhood, from the Virgin Mary to the Hindu goddess Lakshmi, are threaded throughout our consciousness, and they also appear throughout the book as the respective mothers of Adshead’s subjects are lost to them in different, equally painful, circumstances. The order in which these stories are told is far from coincidental, and towards the end of our journey we meet a patient who challenges our definition of what a good mother should or should not be. Perhaps, though, the most moving account of maternal loss is found in Gabriel’s story. Originally from Eritrea, Gabriel arrived in the UK as a young asylum-seeker, fleeing the violence and conflict of his homeland, but becoming separated from his family in the process. With his narrative, and with other chapters, Adshead is keen to convey that while people of colour make up 13% of the UK’s general population, they represent around 25% of the populations within prisons and secure hospitals, a ratio reflected within the book itself. Statistics such as these, along with the work of theorists and historians, are peppered throughout the pages. But this is not an academic text, and though there is a gentle invitation in the notes to explore these issues further, at no point did I feel I had returned to a lecture theatre. The background and context we are given throughout the stories only add to their breadth and texture, and huge credit must be given here to Adshead’s co-author, the writer and dramatist Eileen Horne, who has collaborated with Adshead in this “joint exercise in empathy”.

Equity Forward produces investigative research on human rights, gender equity and sexual and reproductive health and justice.</p> <p>These 10 states funneled the money through “Alternatives to Abortion” programs, part of state budgets established by conservative legislatures and often run through state health departments. They not only send millions in federal welfare funds, but also state taxpayer dollars to such centers.</p> <p>Clinton-era welfare reforms caused, “a fundamental shift in how cash assistance to families with children with little or no income was funded”, said Ife Floyd, a senior policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.</p> <p>“States have control over those dollars in a way they didn’t necessarily have before,” Floyd added.</p> <p>The result has been increasingly dramatic variation in how states spent the federal dollars. States, especially in the south, have imposed harsh eligibility requirements in debates <a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/blog/family-cash-assistance-programs-marked-by-historical-racism-especially-in-south\">marred by racism</a>, and pushed people off benefits even in times of economic turmoil, such as the Great Recession and the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> <p>As the 2001 book <a href=\"http://www.yorku.ca/crsp/issue51/issue51-14.pdf\">Welfare Racism</a> described it, legislators developed a “preoccupation with controlling the alleged sexual immorality and supposed preference of welfare over work of one group: African-American females”.</p> <p>Missouri is one such example of how welfare has withered. In 2015, the state passed <a href=\"https://www.senate.mo.gov/15info/BTS_Web/Bill.aspx?SessionType=R&amp;BillID=153\">draconian welfare reforms</a> that imposed a 45-month lifetime limit for cash assistance, <a href=\"https://cssp.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Racist-Roots-of-Work-Requirements-CSSP-1.pdf\">work requirements</a> and sanctions for people who did not comply.</p> <p>“We’ve created a new class of Missourians,” Glenn Koenen, a hunger adviser with the left-leaning group Empower Missouri, <a href=\"https://themissouritimes.com/welfare-reform-bill-force-30000-off-food-stamps/\">said at the time the reforms were passed</a>. “We now have legislated that some of our neighbors are too poor to get help from anti-poverty programs.”</p> <p>Between 1 January 2016, when the reform went into effect, and April 2021, more than 71% of beneficiaries dropped off Missouri’s program.

These overwhelmingly Republican-led states used money from the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program (Tanf), better known as welfare or direct cash aid, to fund the activities of anti-abortion clinics associated with the evangelical right. The clinics work to dissuade women from obtaining abortions. In all cases, the states used these funds even as Covid-19 caused the worst economic upheaval in nearly a century, left one in four families without enough to eat, and resulted in mass layoffs that had a disproportionate effect on low-income and racial minority Americans. “They’re not a replacement for Tanf, by any stretch of the imagination,” said Andrea Swartzendruber, an associate professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Georgia College of Public Health, whose research has focused on how crisis pregnancy centers operate. Indiana, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Texas have all used federal Tanf funds to support anti-abortion clinics. The revelation is to be published in a report by the accountability group Equity Forward, which was provided exclusively to the Guardian. Equity Forward produces investigative research on human rights, gender equity and sexual and reproductive health and justice. These 10 states funneled the money through “Alternatives to Abortion” programs, part of state budgets established by conservative legislatures and often run through state health departments. They not only send millions in federal welfare funds, but also state taxpayer dollars to such centers. Clinton-era welfare reforms caused, “a fundamental shift in how cash assistance to families with children with little or no income was funded”, said Ife Floyd, a senior policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. “States have control over those dollars in a way they didn’t necessarily have before,” Floyd added. The result has been increasingly dramatic variation in how states spent the federal dollars. States, especially in the south, have imposed harsh eligibility requirements in debates marred by racism, and pushed people off benefits even in times of economic turmoil, such as the Great Recession and the Covid-19 pandemic. As the 2001 book Welfare Racism described it, legislators developed a “preoccupation with controlling the alleged sexual immorality and supposed preference of welfare over work of one group: African-American females”. Missouri is one such example of how welfare has withered. In 2015, the state passed draconian welfare reforms that imposed a 45-month lifetime limit for cash assistance, work requirements and sanctions for people who did not comply. “We’ve created a new class of Missourians,” Glenn Koenen, a hunger adviser with the left-leaning group Empower Missouri, said at the time the reforms were passed. “We now have legislated that some of our neighbors are too poor to get help from anti-poverty programs.” Between 1 January 2016, when the reform went into effect, and April 2021, more than 71% of beneficiaries dropped off Missouri’s program. That included 28,643 children and 16,942 families. Missouri then spent funds not paid to families on other programs, among them the Alternatives to Abortion program. Since 2017, it has sent $26m to anti-abortion clinics, according to state budgets. The average monthly benefit for a Missouri family is $256. The program gained traction after it was pioneered in 2001 by the former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum, who also helped craft the 1990s welfare reforms that made such state spending possible. That year, Pennsylvania became the first state to divert Tanf funds to anti-abortion clinics, and sent $1m to its Alternatives to Abortion program. The program was then popularized with help from the Pennsylvania-based anti-abortion clinic Real Alternatives, whose representatives went on to “educate” other anti-abortion organizations about how to obtain state funding. Conservative states then replicated the program as welfare reform passed out of the public spotlight, abortion restrictions proved a winning strategy for Republicans, and anti-abortion clinics lobbied for more funds. Ohio Right to Life, for example, said it “pursued” federal welfare funds for three years in a row. While there is no public accounting of all the federal funds anti-abortion clinics have received in the last two decades, Texas’s large program sheds light on the sheer volume of cash. Since 2006, Texas has sent $45m in federal welfare funds to crisis pregnancy centers. Texas has extraordinarily strict income limits for its welfare program – a family of four can earn no more than $231 per month to be eligible. Conservative lawmakers have argued anti-abortion clinics provide assistance to the needy by helping women who unexpectedly find themselves pregnant or in “crisis”.

But those figures don’t tell the whole story, as they are dramatically skewed in states hostile to abortion rights. In some states, the balance is one abortion provider to 15 anti-abortion clinics. In Missouri, that balance is one to 74, as the state has worked aggressively to shut down its only remaining abortion clinic, a Planned Parenthood in St Louis. Many states have chosen to divert these funds amid chronic budget shortfalls, shield centers from public scrutiny and allow contractors to conduct their own oversight. In 2017, Oklahoma ranked number one in cuts to education and female incarceration. Nevertheless, the state chose to continue to divert Tanf funds to crisis pregnancy centers even amid chronic budget deficits. Advocates have also been blocked in their attempts to understand how crisis pregnancy centers work with state agencies. Missouri has attempted to charge Equity Forward $26,219 for an open records request for emails. Often, crisis pregnancy centers used federal welfare funds and state taxpayer dollars with little oversight. In North Dakota and Oklahoma, the only oversight provision in contracts states crisis pregnancy centers must be “outcome-driven with positive results”.

To do this, they are placing their hopes on an unassuming, poisonous plant called milkweed. Monarch butterflies, known for their distinctive orange and black pattern, once flocked to California in the millions, spending the winter clumped on trees as they migrated to and from the state’s central coast. But the population has sharply declined from 4.5 million in the 1980s, dropping to nearly 200,000 in recent decades before taking a precipitous dive in 2018.

It’s great to see people rallying to save these animals.”","charCount":"5479","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/erin-mccormick\">Erin McCormick</a> in Berkeley"},{"headline":"California sheriff warns officers not to join far-right extremist groups, records reveal","standfirst":"<p>Training documents reviewed by the Guardian show the Orange county department is also warning about the ‘extreme left’ and Black Panthers, raising concerns about false equivalency<br></p>","trailText":"Training documents reviewed by the Guardian show the Orange county department is also warning about the ‘extreme left’ and Black Panthers, raising concerns about false equivalency<br>","byline":"Sam Levin in Los Angeles","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dd3fefa3769adbfa46373aa123a0fd534c11ee71\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd3fefa3769adbfa46373aa123a0fd534c11ee71/0_22_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Orange county deputies during a protest in Yorba Linda, California.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Orange county deputies during a protest in Yorba Linda, California.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mindy Schauer/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>The sheriff’s department in Orange county, California, advised its officers earlier this year not to affiliate with far-right extremist groups and warned them against engaging with white supremacist websites, according to internal documents reviewed by the Guardian.</p> <p>The Orange county sheriff’s department’s “extremism awareness” training document from February instructed officers not to share disinformation and to avoid associating with militias, QAnon, rightwing platforms like Gab and 4chan, as well as second-amendment groups or law enforcement “clubs” that could be “avenues for exploitation”.</p> <p>The 66-page PowerPoint presentation for staff also included a lengthy section on “the extreme left”, warning officers about “Karl Marx’s influence”; the history of the Black Panther party; anti-fascist groups’ vandalism and “improvised weapons”; and animal rights and anti-war protesters.</p> <p>The training is notable, experts said, because it suggests that sheriff’s officials were acknowledging that their own officers could be drawn to far-right groups and were concerned about the risks of them posting racist or extremist content.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4856b828ca054f169c6a52de00e00611fe95f40d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4856b828ca054f169c6a52de00e00611fe95f40d/0_0_841_462/500.jpg\" alt=\"A slide from the OCSD training.\" width=\"500\" height=\"275\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A slide from the OCSD training.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Orange county sheriff’s department</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Experts said it was unusual to see this kind of training from local police.

The Orange county sheriff’s department’s “extremism awareness” training document from February instructed officers not to share disinformation and to avoid associating with militias, QAnon, rightwing platforms like Gab and 4chan, as well as second-amendment groups or law enforcement “clubs” that could be “avenues for exploitation”. The 66-page PowerPoint presentation for staff also included a lengthy section on “the extreme left”, warning officers about “Karl Marx’s influence”; the history of the Black Panther party; anti-fascist groups’ vandalism and “improvised weapons”; and animal rights and anti-war protesters. The training is notable, experts said, because it suggests that sheriff’s officials were acknowledging that their own officers could be drawn to far-right groups and were concerned about the risks of them posting racist or extremist content. Experts said it was unusual to see this kind of training from local police. But they also criticized the training for falsely presenting the far right and the “extreme left” as equivalent threats, when data shows that white supremacists perpetuated the large majority of recent domestic terror attacks. The files – obtained through records requests by Property of the People, a not-for-profit transparency group – come from a California region with a long history of far-right violence. That includes a recent Ku Klux Klan rally, a 2018 killing of a gay teenager by a member of a neo-Nazi group, and several local activists participating in the 6 January insurrection at the US Capitol, two of them now facing charges. And it comes amid growing concern over the infiltration of US law enforcement by far-right groups, and the participation of former and current members of police departments and the military in the 6 January Capitol riot. The OC sheriff’s department has its own recent history of scandals. A deputy was caught last year wearing insignia of far-right militia groups while monitoring a protest for George Floyd, and the department has been repeatedly accused of abuse and discrimination in the local jail and in its use of force. A special officer with the department was also recently suspended after she joined the crowd at the Capitol on 6 January, leading the FBI to search her home. ‘Your personal life can’t interfere with your job’ OCSD’s training was created last year after the OC deputy “wore an unauthorized patch on his uniform while on-duty at a protest”, Carrie Braun, a department spokesperson, told the Guardian.

The head of the Wellcome Trust, Sir Jeremy Farrar, and the executive director of Unicef UK, Steven Waugh, have published an open letter to Boris Johnson appealing for the UK to set an example ahead of the G7 summit in Cornwall, which begins in a week’s time. UK science played a core part in “breathtaking advances” that have enabled vaccines to be developed, which is the way out of the pandemic, they say in their letter. They write: At home, the UK vaccination rollout has been a phenomenal success and has already saved countless lives. Yet, globally too many countries still lack doses to protect healthcare workers and the most vulnerable. As president of the G7, the UK has the opportunity to set the standard for global action on sharing doses. Three months ago, you proudly pledged that the UK would share vaccines with the world. Now we ask that you turn this pledge into reality. Read the full story here: Prevalence of self-reported long Covid was greatest in people aged 35 to 69 years, females, those living in the most deprived areas, those working in health or social care and those with another activity-limiting health condition or disability, the ONS found. There is no universally agreed definition of long Covid but it covers a broad range of symptoms such as fatigue, muscle pain and difficulty concentrating, PA Media reports. Fatigue (weakness or tiredness) was the most common symptom reported as part of individuals’ experience of long Covid up until 2 May (547,000 out of 1 million people), followed by shortness of breath (405,000), muscle ache (313,000) and difficulty concentrating (285,000). The Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, said he had wanted the UK to wait longer before its original decision to put Portugal on the green list because coronavirus figures showed it was only “marginally” qualified for that status. Drakeford told PA Media: The figures showed that while Portugal was in a position to be put on the green list, it was only marginally so. I would have waited a bit longer to see whether that position was strengthening so that you can be confident that it would be on the green list, or whether because it was so close to the margin things could have moved against it being on the green list. Now things have deteriorated in Portugal and I know that will be a very significant challenge now for people who are already on holiday there to face quarantining when they return. An estimated 1 million people in private households in the UK reported experiencing “long Covid” in the four weeks to 2 May, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Of these people, an estimated 869,000 first had Covid-19 – or suspected they had Covid-19 – at least 12 weeks previously, while 376,000 first had the virus or suspected they had the virus at least one year ago, PA Media reports. Long Covid was estimated to be adversely affecting the day-to-day activities of 650,000 people, with 192,000 reporting that their ability to undertake day-to-day activities had been limited a lot. Cristóvão Norte, Portuguese MP for the Algarve, said he is “perplexed” by the British government’s decision to remove Portugal from the green list. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: We were not expecting the decision because there haven’t been major changes in Portugal, just a spike in the Lisbon area. But we have 66 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. Our rate of transmission is more or less the UK rate, so we weren’t expecting this decision from the English government. We wear masks, we obey the rules, we maintain social distancing, vaccination is growing steadily. So I’m a little bit perplexed. Norte added: I have to respect the decision. We would like to know sooner. This causes great uncertainty. He said it is “a huge blow” on the economy, adding that the country heavily depends on British tourism. Julia Lo Bue-Said, chief executive of travel agent group Advantage Travel Partnership, said the decision in relation to Portugal was “an absolute devastating blow” for consumers and the industry, PA Media reports. She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: It now throws confidence completely out of the window. It puts the industry in a really difficult position and consumers in a difficult position in order to be able to plan effectively. Tim Hawkins, chief strategy officer at Manchester Airports Group, which owns Manchester, Stansted and East Midlands airports, claimed the government “isn’t willing to take any risk at all”, and urged ministers to “trust in the traffic light system”. He told Times Radio: For people coming back from green countries you have to take a pre-departure test, you have to take a test when you come back. There is not a free flow of people coming back from those countries. There are safeguards, there are measures in place to control those kinds of things, but the government seems to have ignored those. Portugal is not the only country that has moved on the traffic light rating system. Afghanistan, Bahrain, Costa Rica, Sudan, and Trinidad and Tobago have also been placed on the red list, meaning people arriving in the UK from those nations must stay in a quarantine hotel for 11 nights. The changes come into effect at 4am on Tuesday. The Delta variant of coronavirus, first discovered in India, is anywhere between 30% to 100% more transmissible than the previously dominant Alpha (or Kent) variant, according to Prof Neil Ferguson, whose Covid modelling was key to the UK’s first lockdown. Ferguson is a leading epidemiologist at Imperial College London who advised the government at the beginning of the pandemic. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “We’re certainly getting more data. Unfortunately, the news is not as positive as I would like in any respect about the Delta variant. The best estimate at the moment is this variant may be 60% more transmissible than the Alpha [Kent] variant. “There’s some uncertainty around that depending on assumption and how you analyse the data, between about 30% and maybe even up to 100% more transmissible.” It comes as the date of lifting lockdown approaches, with 21 June the proposed time when the government will remove “all legal limits on social contact”, although some social distancing and mask-wearing rules will remain. Read the full story here: Here’s a clip of Prof Neil Ferguson talking about the potential easing of restrictions on 21 June. He says the Delta variant may be 60% more transmissible than the variant first identified in Kent and it is doubling across the country “about every nine days”. Robert Jenrick said there was still “nothing at the moment that suggests that we won’t be able to move forward” with the next stage of lifting restrictions on 21 June. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: We’ve got a further 10 days until we are going to make that decision on or around June 14, so during that period we’ll see where are we with hospitalisations, with deaths, where are we with the vaccine rollout – we’re doing everything we possibly can to expedite that – and then at that point, we’ll make our final decision. Asked whether measures such as wearing masks and working from home could continue after 21 June, Jenrick told the Today programme: Well, there are options that are clearly available to the government. We set out within the road map what would be expected to happen at the next stage and we want to try to stick to that if we possibly can. All of us are moving everything we can to achieve that. But of course, we keep these things under review and we’re also asking people to continue to exercise caution in their daily lives. Communities secretary Robert Jenrick insisted a watchlist, where countries at risk of moving from the green to amber list are placed, is still an option. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: The watchlist system remains, if it’s possible to do that. If you’re seeing that cases are gradually rising, that positivity is increasing, then one may be able to use that and if you can, obviously it’s preferable to do so because you want to give people and the industry that forward guidance. But if you’re seeing new variants or versions of variants emerging, you may need to act more swiftly, and I think that is the right thing to do. First minister Mark Drakeford has said he believes Wales is “right to be concerned” about the Delta variant of Covid-19. “It is spreading very quickly in the north-west of England, right on our border,” Drakeford told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. We know it’s more transmissible. There is some evidence that it is driving more people into hospitals. Drakeford said the country’s chief medical officer had advised on Thursday that Wales should “phase in” its move to alert level one over the next three weeks. He said a cluster of cases of the Delta variant in Llandudno was believed to be “under the control” of public health teams in the area but 300 people were self-isolating as a result of it. He said: We’ve had examples in schools and in workplaces in that part of Wales and our caution is grounded in what the science is saying to us about the potential impact of that new variant more widely in Wales. Dame Irene Hays, owner of travel agent Hays Travel, said she was “surprised and obviously disappointed” to hear of Portugal’s move off the green list for travel from the UK. She told Sky News: [I’m] disappointed for our customers, disappointed for the travel industry and really disappointed for Portugal, because they’ve tried so hard and their infection rates are so low. I know they’re rising in Lisbon, but it’s quite a way from the Algarve, which is where most of the tourists are. Asked if she felt that nuance had not been taken into consideration, Hays said: It would be nice if it was a nuanced approach, but we are where we are. It is “difficult” and “very frustrating” for holidaymakers, particularly those who had just started their trips, she added. While some people are still booking holidays for the summer, Hays said the “vast majority” are instead booking for autumn or 2022. Moving Portugal off the UK’s green list is “an overreaction”, an epidemiologist in the popular holiday destination has said. Prof Henrique Barros, the president of Portugal’s National Health Council, said the overall situation in the country is “relatively stable”. The communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, said positive cases had doubled in the last three weeks in Portugal. Barros told Sky News: We didn’t reach such an increase, except as I said in a specific area around Lisbon. The overall picture in the country, we didn’t reach such figures. Asked about Portugal being moved to the amber list for travel, he said: I think it’s an overreaction. But of course you know that people moving from one country to the other, it’s obviously a risk for both countries, of course. We know that we should pay attention to the situation. He said it is mainly people aged under 40 and 30 where a rise in infections is being seen, and that with people over 50 “we have a very, very low incidence of cases”. The health chief said hospital admissions at the present time are “very low”, at less than 25 people per million, while those in intensive care are at less than five people per million. Barros stressed that officials in the country “pay a lot of attention” to monitoring the virus. Robert Jenrick said he did not know how many cases there were of the new Nepal variant of the coronavirus. Speaking to the Today programme, the communities secretary said it appeared to be a “further mutation of the Indian variant”. When asked how the Nepal variant could be used as a reason to remove Portugal from the green list if he did not know how many cases there were, Jenrick said: We have seen that there are cases of it, they are picking this up, and we took the decision that it was better to be cautious whilst we learn about this new mutation of the variant. Jenrick said he was not aware of any cases of the Nepal variant in the UK. He said Portuguese scientists had detected the variant, but said: What we don’t yet know is how prevalent it is in Portugal – but more importantly than that, whether this really is a significant problem. You could, of course, wait whilst we do that research and then, God forbid, we learn that it is very virulent, that it does compromise our vaccines, or we can take a safety-first approach. He was also on BBC Breakfast defending the decision to add Portugal to the amber list, saying “it’s right to be careful”. The communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, said the decision not to move Portugal off the green list until Tuesday meant people could travel home in an “orderly” manner. He told BBC Breakfast: We think it’s sensible to give people a period of time to return home to the UK. As I say, they’ve got until Tuesday to do so, that’s designed to help people to come back in an orderly manner, to not see scenes at airports where people are crowded together. There are risks involved in creating that sort of situation. We have taken a cautious approach by taking Portugal off the green list, putting it back onto the amber list, and I think that’s the right thing to do to protect the public. Prof Neil Ferguson said most people in hospital with the virus have not had a vaccine. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today Programme: It’s important to say that most people being hospitalised at the moment with this variant, and with any Covid variant, are unvaccinated. So, it’s clear that the vaccines are still having a substantial effect, though it may be slightly compromised. He said they are still waiting for data on how much the Delta variant can evade the immunity which protects people against being admitted to hospital. He said: The data being reported relates to unvaccinated people, so if you haven’t been vaccinated there appears to be, both from Public Health England data and from Public Health Scotland data independently, about a twofold increased risk of hospitalisation. Professor Neil Ferguson said he thinks the data is “pointing this week in a more negative direction than it was last week” and that it would be a “very difficult judgment call” when asked about whether the 21 June lifting of restrictions needs to be delayed. The epidemiologist and former government adviser told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: First of all, it’s not my job to make that decision, thankfully. I think the data is pointing this week in a more negative direction than it was last week, so it points towards the direction of being cautious. I think balancing, clearly, people’s desire – and there clearly is a built-up desire to get back to normal – against the potential risk is a very difficult judgment call. Welcome to today’s liveblog.

In the interim we’ve seen an aged care worker who worked, as I understand it, at the Arcare facility in Maidstone, working in another facility, potentially exposing residents at the second facility. </p> <p>The government needs to explain why they thought the risk had receded to such a degree that it was able to lift the ban that was in place last year. </p> <p>We know again through bitter tragic experience that about 84% of exposures in the Victorian aged care system last year, which resulted in 655 deaths, were a product of contact through aged care workers or aged care staff.</p> <p> So this is a very important issue.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"83a434e2200d0a208a3f2424e90c22a858507b91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83a434e2200d0a208a3f2424e90c22a858507b91/176_117_5392_3595/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shadow Minister for Health Mark Butler at a press conference at Parliament House in Canberra, Monday, May 31, 2021.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shadow Minister for Health Mark Butler at a press conference at Parliament House in Canberra, Monday, May 31, 2021.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mick Tsikas/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-05-31T04:17:37.556Z\">at 5.17am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-60b45cd28f086d71cc15fb26\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-05-31T03:59:16.154Z\">4.59am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This is, as<strong> Mel Davey</strong> has reported, after the federal government has already admitted that its “guidelines’’ CAN’T be enforced.</p> <p>So in Victoria, workers in state-run aged care facilities cannot work across multiple sites, and pay and policy settings have been updated to reflect that.</p> <p>But staff in private aged care facilities - for which the federal government has oversight - CAN work across multiple facilities.</p> <p>Workers in many cases are forced to do this in order to earn a liveable wage. It is one of the reasons the aged care royal commission wants to see aged care workers paid more. Labor has committed to that - not through a levy, as suggested, but by ensuring more federal funds go to wages.</p> <p>But despite the lessons of the pandemic there have been no changes for aged care in federally funded, private aged care facilities.</p> <p>There are now three aged care workers who have tested positive to Covid in private, federally funded Victorian aged care centres, and one resident, across two facilities. One staff member had worked alongside the initial worker who tested positive at the Arcare Maidstone centre - and then went to a different facility for another shift.</p> <p>Again, this is not the fault of the workers.

We have some very serious times that we’re dealing with, not just from the health point of view but obviously from a regional security point of view and Australia and New Zealand take a very prominent role in the Pacific, and I thank you for the relationship we’ve had working on particularly those issues in the Pacific.</p> <p> It is true that Australia and New Zealand has done very well in the course of Covid. But as you can see in Victoria now, those challenges persist. And equally in Fiji, they are dealing with the challenges, and Papua New Guinea, they are dealing with challenges. We’re supporting all of our Pacific family through our vaccine dose delivery into those regions and supporting them in their vaccinations.</p> <p> But the broader issue of the Indo-Pacific and a free and open Indo-Pacific is something Australia and New Zealand feels very strongly about. And working with our like-minded partners all around the world, the United States and the United Kingdom, and as we’re discussing across Europe, Japan and India, all of us have a big stake in ensuring a world that favours freedom and a free and open Indo-Pacific. And so we greatly appreciate the partnership we have to achieve those outcomes.</p> <p> So with those issues all on the table today, we should, we should move on and get on with it. I really appreciate the direct personal relationship and dialogue we’ve had and, and that will only continue because we have common challenges, there are common threats, and that has always I think eclipsed everything when it comes to the strength of the working family relationship.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"31491fbfd2663eb7c8525686f3d2003381a73307\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31491fbfd2663eb7c8525686f3d2003381a73307/0_0_4111_2741/1000.jpg\" alt=\"New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern (L) poses for a photo with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison ahead of their annual talks on Monday, May 31, 2021 in Queenstown, New Zealand.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern (L) poses for a photo with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison ahead of their annual talks on Monday, May 31, 2021 in Queenstown, New Zealand.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Allison/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-05-31T01:23:35.983Z\">at 2.23am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-60b4366a8f088d8c3178e13f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-05-31T01:06:01.284Z\">2.06am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>NSW Health has also updated its vaccination numbers</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NSWHealth/status/1399168940278829058\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The total number of vaccines administered in NSW is now 1,287,975 with 418,996 doses administered by NSW Health to 8pm last night and 868,979 administered by  the GP network and other providers, to 11:59pm on Friday 28 May 2021.</p>&mdash; NSW Health (@NSWHealth) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NSWHealth/status/1399168940278829058?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 31, 2021</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60b435738f088d8c3178e136\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-05-31T01:02:09.106Z\">2.02am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">NSW records no local Covid cases</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>NSW has recorded no locally acquired cases in the last 24 hours.</p> <p>Two people in hotel quarantine have tested positive for the virus.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-05-31T01:05:37.780Z\">at 2.05am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-60b433ab8f08d486a7717fa0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/melissa-davey\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-05-31T00:59:31.415Z\">1.59am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/may/28/overcrowding-in-victorian-hospitals-bigger-emergency-than-covid-expert-warns\">I wrote about how overcrowding in Victoria’s healthcare system is a “bigger public health emergency than Covid”</a>, according to a leading emergency physician who says the state’s doctors and nurses were exhausted even before the latest outbreak.<br><br>The Australasian College for Emergency Medicine Victoria faculty chair, <strong>Dr Mya Cubitt, </strong>said on Friday that doctors and nurses in public hospitals had been dreading such a situation because they were still recovering from Victoria’s second wave in 2020.

(Always better to check these things before saying them on national television.)</p> <p><strong>Josh Frydenberg </strong>hasn’t said there will be no assistance – just none right now. This was his response on Facebook yesterday, following criticism from the Victorian government about the Morrison government going MIA:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Since the end of jobkeeper Victoria is the third state to introduce a short lockdown. Greater Brisbane was subject to stay-at-home orders from 29 March to 1 April, the Perth metropolitan and Peel region was under stay-at-home orders from 24 to 27 April and Victoria is currently under stay-at-home orders from 28 May to 3 June.</p> <p>In both the Queensland and Western Australian lockdowns further federal support was not required. In the case of Victoria, the Morrison government has provided and continues to provide an unprecedented level of direct economic support. Over $45bn has already flowed to Victorian families and businesses during Covid, with more direct federal economic support per capita going to Victoria than to any other state. </p> <p>The amount of federal government direct economic support delivered to Victoria is around three times what has been delivered by the state government. The federal government continues to provide support to Victorian families and businesses through this pandemic. </p> <p>The pandemic leave disaster payment of $1,500 is available as is the national health emergency crisis payment. For businesses that experience losses, the loss carry-back measure is available to boost cash flow at the end of the financial year. </p> <p>The economic impact of the Victorian outbreak is not insignificant but the budget just over two weeks ago did anticipate further outbreaks would occur. Our budget measures were calibrated accordingly, with the budget providing an additional $41bn of Covid-related economic support. Should extended lockdowns be avoided and outbreaks contained the national economy can continue its strong recovery.</p> <p>The Morrison government will continue to work with the Victorian government<strong> and closely monitor the situation.</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>I’m not sure what good it is telling people they received a higher share of financial help previously is, when they need help now. And it is possible other Australian jurisdictions will be in the same spot. The last sentence is the interesting one there – “closely monitor the situation” is usually code for, “if this gets worse, we’ll have to do something”. Which is cold comfort for people who have seen all their shifts disappear, with no warning, just as they were starting to get back on their feet.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-05-30T23:08:32.642Z\">at 12.08am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-60b416078f088d8c3178e037\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-05-30T22:47:56.487Z\">11.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There are now <a href=\"https://www.coronavirus.vic.gov.au/exposure-site\">268 exposure sites on the Victorian Health website</a></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60b413048f086d71cc15f876\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-05-30T22:42:03.166Z\">11.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Former Labor MP <strong>Emma Husar, </strong>who was forced to resign from the federal parliament after “slut-shaming” allegations were reported against her (an investigation into the allegations later found no basis for the salacious claims against her and Husar subsequently won a defamation action against Buzzfeed) wants an apology from <strong>Anthony Albanese</strong> (as leader) and damages from the Labor party.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/emma_husar/status/1398892095687979012\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Who would have thought women needed protection from their own party? <br>Sexual harassment isn’t new, women in Canberra deserve better, the ALP needs to take responsibility for their conduct in this, own their failings &amp; BE sorry <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/auspol?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#auspol</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/hFbDgkQS9e\">https://t.co/hFbDgkQS9e</a></p>&mdash; Emma Husar (@emma_husar) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/emma_husar/status/1398892095687979012?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 30, 2021</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p><strong>Bill Shorten</strong> was leader at the time, and is asked whether Husar deserves an apology from the Labor party:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I do think that Emma – she was on the receiving end of some poor treatment, too. </p> <p>So I have spoken to her in the past.

Via AAP: Repatriated Australians in the Northern Territory who’ve been in interstate hotel quarantine will now have to be re-tested for COVID-19 after they leave the facility. It comes amid fears the new Indian variant of the virus could be spread by returned travellers who’ve completed their mandatory 14-day quarantine period. The tests will be required three days after they leave hotel quarantine or on day 17 if they come to the NT, Chief Minister Michael Gunner told reporters Monday. “This is a direction that reduces the risk to Territorians from interstate hotel quarantine,” he said. “I acknowledge it will be an inconvenience but we’ve always said we’ll do whatever it takes to keep Territorians safe.” People who arrive in the NT after day 17 but before the 28th day since they entered quarantine will still be required to have a test. “This new direction will give us protection against the exact scenario that we’ve seen send Melbourne into lockdown again, he said. “That outbreak started from a returned international traveller who completed their 14 days quarantine in South Australia then returned a negative test.” Acting Chief Medical Officer Charles Pain urged Territorians to get vaccinated to protect themselves and the community. “This is critical now, we will continue to be faced with the fear that these outbreaks will spread in our community,” he said. “Vaccination is absolutely vital to protect us.” Meanwhile, two sisters have allegedly escaped an Alice Springs quarantine facility by abseiling from their room. The pair, aged 19 and 22, then jumped the perimeter fence into a waiting vehicle, Police Commissioner Jamie Chalker said. “I can say they were up on the first floor. They managed to abseil down and work through that, and then up and over a fence to head off,” he said. “That’s something that’s very deeply concerning, again noting this is not a prison.” The women were driven to their mother’s home and she later reported them to police. The women returned to quarantine, accompanied by their mother and one of their boyfriends, a police spokeswoman said. One of the women was uncooperative when told she’d have to go back to the Todd Facility but eventually complied. Both the mother and boyfriend have also been directed into mandatory supervised quarantine. Infringements notices have been issued to both women. The NT penalty for failing to abide by the CHO’s directions is $5056 for an individual and $25,280 for a business. We are still waiting to hear from Christian Porter. The 2021 State of Origin opener will be played in Townsville after the Covid-19 outbreak in Melbourne forced the match to be moved from the MCG. Queensland Country Bank stadium will host the game on 9 June with Victoria in lockdown following the recent emergence of coronavirus cases in the state. The Australian Rugby League Commission and the Victorian government on Monday approved the relocation of the game, nine days out from the series opener. The NRL’s CEO, Andrew Abdo, said: We’re operating in a pandemic and our absolute priority is ensuring the continuity of the competition and our major events. Townsville has the lowest risk of a Covid outbreak impacting the game and the least financial fallout of the available venues. Townsville is also a new, state of the art venue, with the capabilities to host an event with a global audience like Origin, placing it ahead of alternate regional locations. It means Queensland will host two of this year’s three games, with game two scheduled for Brisbane’s Suncorp stadium, before the final match is played at Sydney’s Stadium Australia. Melbourne will now host games in 2024 and 2026. Abdo said: I understand some fans will have wanted a neutral venue but the reality is we are working within a pandemic and we have to make decisions that ensure Origin proceeds as scheduled and with the lowest financial impact on the game. We’re very disappointed that we can’t open the series at the MCG. We really wanted to bring a major event to Melbourne after everything Victorians have been through over the last year. Public safety is our absolute priority and given the current outbreak, it remains uncertain whether we could host a mass gathering in Melbourne next week. Townsville will host the first State of Origin game next week. It was meant to be played in Melbourne but the lockdown, and the worry over the cases and exposure sites, means it needed to be moved. For Townsville, this is HUGE news. You don’t get much more NRL mad than Cowboy country. On aged care vaccinations Louise Milligan has responded Back to Greg Hunt for a moment -here he is explaining why the federal government has not done anything to ensure aged care workers in federally funded facilities don’t have to work across multiple sites. It is, he says, something the states could do, despite private aged care homes being regulated and funded by the federal government. In relation to single site workforce, the important thing here is that has been triggered, in non- outbreak times, ...is the need to make sure there are adequate staff resources for resident safety, that means for example, it is critical that we can have testing staff move between sites, vaccinated staff move between sites, clinical first responders exactly as we are now, the need to cover those that are ill and the need for search workforce, all of those things show the need for flexibility. Having said that the advice in the greater Melbourne region it is approximately 4.7% of staff who have worked across different sites, so it is a situation, which is very much in the absolute minority of staff, but the safety of residents, including as I say vaccination testing, clinical first responder, coverage for those ill and the capacity for search workforce, is the reason why the authorities had previously not made a change, it is very much something that could be done under public-health orders at the state level. And here is Hunt on mandatory vaccinations for aged care staff: In relation to mandating for aged care workers, that had been previously looked at by the Chief Health Officer is of the states, along with the Commonwealth, the Prime Minister and myself have asked the medical expert panel to review that decision, that was not recommended at the time, we have asked the medical expert panel to review precisely that question. We haven’t heard from Christian Porter as yet – just the ABC – but we will update you. The ABC has just sent out the following statement: Christian Porter has decided to discontinue his defamation action against the ABC and Louise Milligan. All parties have agreed to not pursue the matter any further. No damages will be paid. The ABC stands by the importance of the article, which reported on matters of significant public interest, and the article remains online. It has been updated with this Editor’s Note: ‘On 26 February 2021, the ABC published an article by Louise Milligan.That article was about a letter to the Prime Minister containing allegations against a senior cabinet minister. Although he was not named, the article was about the Attorney-General Christian Porter. The ABC did not intend to suggest that Mr Porter had committed the criminal offences alleged. The ABC did not contend that the serious accusations could be substantiated to the applicable legal standard – criminal or civil. However, both parties accept that some readers misinterpreted the article as an accusation of guilt against Mr Porter. That reading, which was not intended by the ABC, is regretted.’ The ABC stands by our investigative and public interest journalism, which is always pursued in the interests of the Australian community. The ABC stands by Louise Milligan, one of Australia’s foremost and most awarded investigative journalists, and all our journalists in their independent and brave reporting on matters about which Australians have a right to be informed. Greg Hunt says four million doses have now been administered under Australia’s Covid vaccine program - that was a target we were supposed to hit in March. AAP has kindly put together a summary of the Victorian press conference: There are 11 new coronavirus cases, including six since midnight on Monday (the six new cases will appear in tomorrow’s figures); Including Monday’s six infections, the number of active cases is 60 (including hotel quarantine); There were 43,874 Covid tests done in the 24 hours to Monday morning, along with 16,752 vaccine doses; More than 4200 primary close contacts have been identified - 77 per cent of those have returned negative test results. AGED CARE CASES There are three new cases linked to the Arcare Maidstone aged care facility: One of those is the son of the Altona worker who tested positive on Sunday; The second is an unvaccinated colleague who also worked at the Blue Cross Western Gardens facility in Sunshine from Wednesday to Friday; The third is a resident, a woman in her 90s, who has been moved to hospital. Four aged care facilities are now in lockdown. With vaccine hesitancy in Australia on the rise and misinformation swirling, how do you convince friends and family who are fearful or sceptical that they should get the jab? We want to hear from our readers about successful conversations you’ve had with those who are hesitant to get a vaccine. How did you manage to change their mind about the vaccine? What worked and what didn’t? Share your experience in the comments on this piece here - not in the comments on the blog - and we will highlight some of the most useful contributions. Four days into the (hopefully) week-long Melbourne lockdown, there is still a healthy, if not overwhelming, line outside the Royal Exhibition Building mass-vaccination hub in Melbourne. About 30 people were waiting out the front, safely socially distanced, and all eager to get inside. (It’s unclear if this was out of excitement to be vaccinated or a wish to simply be out of the Melbourne cold.) “My view is, well, you are either part of the problem or part of the solution,” said Alana, lining up with her partner, Randall, their two young kids in tow. “There seem to be a lot of people who were eligible that weren’t taking up the offer. So when our age category [40-49]came up, we jumped on it.” Amelia, who asked for her last name not to be included, said she was excited to finally get the vaccine. She has a preexisting medical condition but had been made to wait for Pfizer to become available. “Obviously with us going back into lockdown again I think it’s prompted a lot of people to come out but, yeah, yeah I guess I feel lucky that I qualify,” she said. “My husband isn’t eligible, a lot of my friends aren’t eligible. So, you know ... I think, take advantage of it if you can. I do feel bad for a lot of people that don’t quite meet the requirements at the moment.” Chris Minns has officially, officially entered the contest for the NSW Labor leadership (much like relationships aren’t offical until they are debuted on social media, political ambitions aren’t official until there is a press conference) Minns: I want to pay tribute to Jodi McKay in the work she did in incredibly difficult circumstances and I will say from the outset I think she has a big role to play in the future of the Labor Party. I want to be leader of the Labor Party, I believe it is time for change. We are in the 10th year of the O’Farrell- Berejiklian - Baird government. ...I believe it is time for Labor to be the party of the future. I believe it is time for Labor to be focusing on ideas that solve problems and I think it is time for Labor to to start the long march to regain the trust of the people of this state. I did not get involved in politics and I don’t believe any of my colleagues got involved in politics just to put out negative press releases on a daily basis attacking the Berejiklian government. Mark Butler has responded to the aged care multiple-sites “guidelines’’ from the federal government: Well, I think it’s been known for some time it is very difficult to make a living wage working particularly in private residential aged care. The shifts are usually short. It’s very hard, very rare to pull together a full-time job. The hourly wages are quite low. So there is I guess a financial incentive for people to work across aged care facilities. That’s why when the results of that became apparent, particularly during the Victorian wave, but also to a degree in New South Wales last year, it was clear the federal government had to step in and provide some support if aged care workers were going to be prevented from working two different jobs in the aged care sector. It’s not clear to me the basis on which the government decided that was no longer necessary in November. And I think the government will have to give an explanation as to why that was the case ... The ban was reintroduced. That’s a good thing. In the interim we’ve seen an aged care worker who worked, as I understand it, at the Arcare facility in Maidstone, working in another facility, potentially exposing residents at the second facility. The government needs to explain why they thought the risk had receded to such a degree that it was able to lift the ban that was in place last year. We know again through bitter tragic experience that about 84% of exposures in the Victorian aged care system last year, which resulted in 655 deaths, were a product of contact through aged care workers or aged care staff. So this is a very important issue. This is, as Mel Davey has reported, after the federal government has already admitted that its “guidelines’’ CAN’T be enforced. So in Victoria, workers in state-run aged care facilities cannot work across multiple sites, and pay and policy settings have been updated to reflect that. But staff in private aged care facilities - for which the federal government has oversight - CAN work across multiple facilities. Workers in many cases are forced to do this in order to earn a liveable wage. It is one of the reasons the aged care royal commission wants to see aged care workers paid more. Labor has committed to that - not through a levy, as suggested, but by ensuring more federal funds go to wages. But despite the lessons of the pandemic there have been no changes for aged care in federally funded, private aged care facilities. There are now three aged care workers who have tested positive to Covid in private, federally funded Victorian aged care centres, and one resident, across two facilities. One staff member had worked alongside the initial worker who tested positive at the Arcare Maidstone centre - and then went to a different facility for another shift. Again, this is not the fault of the workers. It’s the system. The federal Covid update will be delivered at 3pm today. Daniel Andrews won’t be returning to work tomorrow (June 1) but still hopes to be back at some point in June. Here is Martin Foley when asked again why Victoria can’t stop private aged care workers from working at multiple facilities. Private aged care is a federal government responsibility. Foley: I think you’re inviting me to do two things. One is to be critical of the commonwealth, which I’m not going to do. I’m going to work cooperatively with the commonwealth to address a real problem. And you’re inviting me to, on the run, reframe the regulatory framework that’s applied for Covid responses right across the commonwealth in private residential aged care for some 14 months. Clearly the Victorian government, and all the state governments and territory government’s powers when it comes to pandemic responses are broad and significant. But they also try to be as consistent as possible and in line with the national direction set by national cabinet. In this regard, without doubt, the chief health officer’s powers are very broad. But they also need to be appropriately reflected against the national consistent policies wherever that applies. That is in the case of private residential aged care. Jacinda Ardern was asked about the Christchurch terrorist, and whether there are any discussions about him serving out the rest of his life sentence in Australia. She said that “future decisions” on the issue need “to come from the guidance of the community”. We haven’t undergone any formal consultation on future imprisonment and where he should see out the end of his days in prison. But certainly some of the informal feedback has been [that] he should stay in New Zealand.” That was out of a desire for assurance that the sentence be served, Ardern said. Scott Morrison said it was a “deeply sensitive” issue and Australia shared that view. Australia was “open to those dialogues” but “at this point that is not the plan”, he said. The first question at the Scott Morrison and Jacinda Ardern press conference is to the Australian prime minister, asking about earlier comments that Australia is unwilling to sell its sovereignty. Does he think New Zealand has sold its sovereignty to China? Morrison replies “no” - and says that although Australia and New Zealand are trading nations “neither of us will trade our sovereignty or trade away our values”. So we’ve avoided a diplomatic incident there. In answer to a later question, Ardern said she doesn’t detect any difference between Australia and New Zealand on questions of human rights in China. Morrison then agrees. Ardern says New Zealand’s membership of the Five Eyes network is “not in question and not in doubt”. She rejects the suggestion New Zealand is “cosying up” to China. Asked about the travel bubble, Ardern takes a cautious approach: Both of us share enthusiasm, where it is safe to do so, to expand the trans-Tasman bubble. We want to maintain the freedoms we have, which means maintaining the very high bar we’ve set. Given vaccination is not yet widespread we would need to satisfy ourselves there was no risk Covid could enter. There are some Pacific countries where that would be an option - our Pacific neighbours.” Morrison is taken to a specific example of a deportation from Australia to New Zealand - a highly controversial issue in the alliance. He reiterates that Australia’s laws allow it to cancel the visa of anyone convicted of a criminal offence. Ardern does not repeat her most strident criticism of the policy but said she reiterates New Zealand’s views on citizenship and deportation. Morrison is “very clear on New Zealand’s view”, she said. This is something to pay attention to: We’ll leave the Victorian press conference there for a moment and check in with some of the other news that happened in that hour and a bit. I asked the office of the federal aged care services minister Richard Colbeck whether the guidelines that aged care staff should, where possible, only work at one main facility had been relaxed or changed at all before the most recent outbreak. Colbeck did not answer the question, but said single-site funding support for Covid-19 impacted areas of Victoria was triggered for providers across Greater Melbourne on Thursday, 27 May. He said: “This will support residential aged care providers to implement single-site workforce arrangements. The grant funding will be available for out-of-pocket costs incurred during an initial two-week period, from 27 May 2021 to 10 June 2021. If the hotspot declaration is extended, these arrangements will also be extended. Providers are asked to adjust their rosters and ensure staff are only working at one residential aged care facility during this time. A reminder that employers should ensure their workers are not financially disadvantaged during this period and that they continue to receive the income they may have received from other residential aged care providers. Where this results in additional out-of-pocket costs for the primary employer, reimbursement can be sought through the grant application process.” Guardian Australia understands the federal government can’t actually restrict casual staff from supplementing their income by working across sites, despite their guidelines. They can only do so during outbreaks when this funding support is triggered. Ahhh, the art of the subtle burn: Q: Has the COVIDSafe app (the federal government app that was meant to be like ‘‘sunscreen’’) been used at all during the outbreak? Has it identified any areas? Martin Foley: No. Not to my knowledge and I’m sure in such a rare event it would have been brought to my attention. Who has been vaccinated when it comes to Victoria’s frontline workers? Jeroen Weimar So hotel quarantine workers is 100% - there’s a requirement and it’s part of their conditions of service within the system. Within the wider health service, we had critical healthcare workers who were part of the original rollout, going back to February. All of them have been delivered. And recognising people come into roles and move out of roles, wider healthcare service I can give you numbers but over 85% of wider healthcare workers, hundreds of thousands of people across the state have been vaccinated, and [that] includes our public sector residential aged care workforce. Just to highlight that, we started our public sector residential aged care vaccination program back in February. We completed the first round on April 19. We continue to update it as we go through our second-dose cycle. Part of the reason for this lockdown - and the concern - is that this variant of the virus, B.1.617, is more virulent than previous strains. It’s been one of the reasons there are so many primary and secondary contacts, and so many exposure sites. How long can Victorian businesses go without a wage subsidy or some help? James Merlino: Well, this is a devastating time for businesses. And we absolutely acknowledge that. That’s why we delivered a bigger and broader business support package than we delivered in February. And we’ll deliver it as quickly as we can. Businesses are able to provide an expression of interest in terms of it. There will be applications open no later than Wednesday of this week. And businesses, the first payments will start by the end of this week. So we know how tough businesses are doing and that’s why we have provided a quarter of a billion dollars of support. And we feel that the federal government should also support Victorian businesses. Does James Merlino believe the federal government is not providing financial support because it is does not want to encourage “heavy handed lockdowns’’? Merlino: That’s entirely speculative. You’d have to put those questions to the federal treasurer. The treasurer and myself outlined Victoria’s position very, very clearly yesterday. And I’ve got nothing to add to those comments. If the lockdown was smaller, does Merlino believe there would have been support? That’s a question you should put to the federal government. I don’t know their thinking in refusing to provide the support that we’re asking for, that businesses across the state are asking for. That’s a question you’d need to put to the federal government. What does Victoria want from the federal government? We put it to them that there needs to be support for Victorian businesses, wage subsidy is a responsibility of the federal government. We’re in a circuit-breaker lockdown. Businesses are doing it tough. We don’t have JobKeeper. So it was appropriate, we thought, we’re putting a quarter of a billion dollars, bigger and broader than the circuit-breaker lockdown’s business support back in February. We think it’s appropriate that the federal government provide support as well. In terms of why and in terms of their thinking, those are questions you would need to put to them. James Merlino is asked why Victoria is going through this again - why is Victoria “the capital for outbreaks and lockdowns’’? Merlino: Well, I think that is an unfair question. What we have seen right across the nation are breaches in hotel quarantine. Let’s remember that this outbreak that we are dealing with right now originated from a hotel quarantine breach in South Australia. That’s a fact. All the genomic testing points to the outbreak in hotel quarantine in South Australia. Now, I’ve said we would not be in this position, we would be in a very different world, if we had a successful rollout of the commonwealth’s vaccination program. It would be a very different world if we had alongside hotel quarantine alternative quarantine arrangements for our highest-risk cohorts that travel in from overseas. But we don’t have that. What we have had is a breach after 86 days, after 86 days without community transmission in Victoria, we had a breach in South Australia that has led to this outbreak that we are dealing with right now ... I understand the question but every outbreak is different. Everyone who is positive with COVID-19, many do not transmit. Some transmit and are highly infectious. That is the nature of this global pandemic. We’ve had an outbreak from South Australia, [it] travelled to Victoria, and now we are dealing with this outbreak. What people want to see are the actions we are taking to get in front of this outbreak as quickly as we can. What has the lockdown achieved so far? James Merlino: I just want to be honest with people. Every step of the way we are talking to the broader Victorian community about where we are right now. And where we are today is those additional cases that we’ve gone through, a high number of primary close contacts, a high number of exposure sites, very concerning number of very high-risk settings. I want to be clear with people: the next few days are going to be so critically important and that includes the possibility that this outbreak will get worse before it gets better. That’s the situation that we’re in right now and I want to be upfront with people to let them know that’s the case. Have the lessons from last year, in terms of aged care, been learned? Martin Foley: We’re learning more about this virus and how it acts every day and in different settings every day. What we are also learning about is how people respond to that virus every day, in different settings, in different ways. And we’re also learning that the best way in which we can respond to that in a particularly Australian context is to secure our borders through dedicated specific high-risk quarantine facilities being built separate to hotel quarantine. And to avoid the kind of leakage that we’ve seen from the South Australian hotel quarantine breach that is at the heart of this outbreak. And on the other hand we’ve also seen ... how we respond through matching high-risk settings, getting vaccinated, getting tested. It’s up to all of us - doesn’t matter public, private, what the setting is - we all have a shared sense of responsibility to do the right thing here and overcome this breach and overcome this particular high-risk setting in our private residential aged care sector. Can Victoria regulate the private aged care sector? Martin Foley: We just had a royal commission into our aged care sector. It is beyond dispute this sector is regulated, funded and overwhelmingly guided by the commonwealth. In the course of a global pandemic, through the cooperative Victorian Aged Care Response Centre framework, where we all get together with a shared purpose of beating this virus, we share our issues in a cooperative approach in that regard. So I don’t think it’s right to say that this is a sector that is unregulated. It’s where the regulatory power lies. James Merlino says it is “too early to speculate” whether or not the lockdown will be lifted at the end of the seven days. So if you are planning to get married this weekend, or have any other plans (or are a parent of a school-aged child), I am sorry, we can’t give you any concrete answer as to what will happen at the end of the week. Martin Foley is asked whether Covid is back in Victoria’s aged care system and says: Covid-19 cases are back in our residential private aged care system and that is not a good thing, it is a very serious thing that Professor Sutton has indicated, these are a high-risk setting. I don’t have to remind people in Victoria and Australia, the disproportionate impact Covid-19 has on fatalities and private potential, in residential aged care settings. That is why we have prioritised these people in the 1A and IB groups, these high-risk settings. Governments have been very keen on [making] sure we work hand in glove with the commonwealth to deliver support for our sectors, and their sectors, and increasingly, [the] responsibility of getting it done regardless of what sector you are in. Is he frustrated with the federal government, given what happened last year in Victoria’s aged care homes? Foley: You are inviting me to be critical of the commonwealth government in the space. I’m the minister for health, I know how the virus reacts and it does [not] make a distinction between commonwealth and state facilities. My job is to keep Victorians safe, especially in those high-risk settings. There are multiple challenges to that every day, as we see. Public health team responses have been for the past week extraordinary, for the past year. We are keeping up with this, I want to thank everyone involved, I will resist the temptation to be critical of the commonwealth, I will work cooperatively with them every chance I get to get ahead of us. Martin Foley on that topic: Let’s be clear, this is not a particularly unique Victorian set of circumstances, this is a national system that applies across all of the commonwealth. People may recall in the early outbreak back in NSW and Sydney, some of the issues that our NSW friends ran into – common private residential aged care, some of those settings. The challenges they have in responding to that framework. The Victorian public residential aged care system attached to our healthcare network, that is what the tricky government regulates under arrangements. ...We all bring our separate roles and responsibilities to this national pandemic, this global pandemic. When it comes to residential aged care, for the last time, this pandemic has been raging across the country. Public residential aged care is the responsibility of the states. Private residential aged care is the responsibility of the commonwealth. It doesn’t really matter, to the families and communities and the workforce, which is why we have established the Victorian Aged Care Response Centre model so as to co-ordinate that effort. As part that coordination of effort we have continually shared issues and priorities with our friends from the commonwealth and I thank them for their partnership. As part of that partnership, we are now seeing the commonwealth bring forward vaccination programs in some of these private residential aged care centres for staff and workforce. We welcome that. Why did the Victorian government not stop the federal government from allowing aged care workers to move to different centres in private facilities? James Merlino: The answer is, public aged care is the responsibility of state government. Private aged care is the responsibility of the federal government. Can the state step in to stop it? I might ask the minister for health to add to the comments I have made, it’s a very simple proposition. Public sector aged care, state responsibility – we have clear policies in place that has made sure workers don’t work across sites. Private sector aged care is a federal government responsibility. These are absolutely relevant questions everyone is asking – they should be put to the federal government. Acting premier James Merlino is asked about workers in private aged care centres (for which the federal government has oversight) and why they are still able to work across multiple sites, when in the state facilities that is not happening. Merlino: In terms of aged care, the minister for health might supplement my answer. In terms of our workforce, through our policy settings and the financial support for the public sector, we have been able to have 100% of aged care workers in metropolitan Melbourne who are not working across multiple sites. And that’s for a reason. These are high-risk venues. In terms of the settings the federal government do not have, in fact up until I think as recently as last Friday, it was the ability for workers and federal aged care, private sector aged care, to work across sites. That’s a question [for the federal government]. Will the city be separated from regional Victoria again? Brett Sutton: It will be determined as we go through a review of the situation day-by-day. It is not out of the question. Victorian authorities still have a missing link with their earlier cases, which they continue to look for. More on where private aged care staff can work: Victoria’s COVID-19 testing commander Jeroen Weimar has outlined the new exposure sites authorities are particularly concerned about, because they’re tier-one stores and markets. These include: JMDGrocers &amp; Sweets Indian supermarket in Epping Healthy India grocery in Reservoir Inday Filipino Asian Store in Footscray market Thai Huy Butcher in Footscray market You can find the times of concern and the full list of exposure sites here. Weimar said: These and of course a number of the other tier-one exposure sites we have out on our website are really important to us. “We really want to establish who’s been to these locations, capture as many people as possible and make sure we get them tested and isolated as swiftly as we can.” Jeroen Weimer says it is not just the number of cases, but the number of exposure sites - which are still increasing - which is a concern. These exposure sites are ... a major concern for us. The slightly discouraging picture over the last 24 hours in the new cases we have seen overnight is a much shorter period and one associated with the aged care worker. Because she got tested immediately [after her] symptoms onset on Friday, her primary close contacts were also very short into their infectious period. So it reduced the number of exposure sites and that gives us obviously a much better chance of getting a hold of this and putting it down. The more than 4000 people who have been identified as a close or secondary contact of a confirmed case and who are meant to be isolating are being monitored, Brett Sutton says. Six hundred doorknocks are planned for today, and the Australian Defence Force is helping with that. What factors are being considered, in terms of whether or not the lockdown needs to be extended? Brett Sutton: The real measure is not to have more cases but, if cases occur, to make sure that they are quarantining. We have seen increasingly the new cases we identify are already quarantining and that is a good sign. There will be people who – for essential work purposes, for caring compassionate reasons – are still moving about and so some new exposure sites will occur by virtue of that. We need to reflect on how many people are exposed in those settings and the sensitivity of those settings in terms of vulnerable people. Should the federal government have stopped workers in the private aged care sector from working across multiple facilities? (As Mel has pointed out, the guidelines say don’t do it, but they are not enforced. Aged care workers often need to work across multiple sites in order to make a living - another symptom of a casualised workforce, and paying essential workers such low rates.) Brett Sutton: It is a question for the commonwealth, it is a commonwealth workforce. As has been stated, the minister has said that in the public sector, the Victorian public sector, aged care, there has been both financial support and a policy setting that has effectively prohibited work across multiple aged care sites. That is entirely appropriate. It is massively risky to move across different settings ... It is a risk wherever it occurs, it doesn’t matter if it is public or private, but the question as to how it is effectively enforced, supported financially or otherwise in terms of policy, is a question for the commonwealth. Does Brett Sutton believe the state should take over the vaccination rollout for private aged care homes? Sutton: We will work with the commonwealth with whatever assistance they may desire of the states. The minister has made that clear. We are ready and willing to assist with whatever request might come through. The reality is we have been open to vaccinate private aged care workforce for the last three weeks. That continues to be available and if I could say anything to the aged care workforce, practically speaking, the greatest protection you can give to those under your charge, under your care, and I know you care for them, is to get vaccinated, to be fully vaccinated. That would be the greatest protection you could provide to those you are caring for, in whatever setting. And I know that not all of you have been vaccinated to date and there are multiple reasons for that but if it is a matter of tossing up whether or not the vaccine provides protection for you, and by virtue of that to those you care for, please come forward to get tested now. Brett Sutton speaks a little more on the prospect that the lockdown could be extended: We have to prepare for anything. We don’t know what will unfold over coming days. We have said that all the way through. We interrogate the data very deeply on a day-by-day basis. We could get very reassuring news over the rest of today but we have had staff come to us in the last 48 hours. It is very concerning and we need to bear that in mind. Victoria’s chief health officer, professor Brett Sutton, is also implying the seven-day “circuit breaker’’ lock down could be extended. Nothing is confirmed - but the comments so far are not promising. It’s a day-by-day prospect but, as the acting premier said, they are concerning numbers and concerning settings. We’ve gone from a single case at the beginning of the month to 4200 primary close contacts. It has been a rapidly moving virus and the transmission that has occurred in those high-risk settings has been very substantial. So we have to take it as a day-by-day prospect. With more numbers today coming through and those really concerning settings, especially in aged care, we are neck-and-neck with this virus and it is an absolute beast. Jeroen Weimer reminds people to make sure they are well before going out to get vaccinated. If you are feeling unwell, get tested and isolate until you receive your results. The person in charge of Victoria’s testing regime, Jeroen Weimar, is also at this press conference: Over the last seven days of this outbreak we have seen 275,000 Victorians come forward for testing. Over that same period we have delivered 95,600 vaccinations through our state clinics, making a total of 476,000 vaccinations delivered since the start of the vaccination program through our state clinics, part of the 1.1 million doses allocated to Victorians in the last few months. My thanks go to those working in the vaccination stations over a very busy seven-day cycle, the GPs across the state [are] a critical part of the vaccination effort. As the acting premier has said, over the last seven days we have identified 4200 primary close contacts. We continue to see an encouraging set of negative results come back, 77% of those identified have already returned a negative test result. With the huge numbers of tests going through the system, we see that number go up. We have now 279 exposure sites. Martin Foley: The fact this outbreak has crept into a number of private residential aged care facilities is obviously a very great concern to the Victorian government. It’s a very great concern to all Victorians and the commonwealth government. In Victoria, we are very grateful for the support that has been put in place, be that from the Victorian aged care response sector, a joint partnership between the state and the commonwealth; we are grateful for the western public health unit, that has taken the lead in a number of response measures; and we are grateful to the commonwealth and others working in partnership with us to respond to the outbreaks in private residential aged care. Since the start of the pandemic, in 2020, we have put in place additional rigourous measures, to protect our residential aged care facilities – our staff and, most importantly, the residents. While of course the commonwealth is responsible for the regulation of private residential aged care in Victoria, Victoria has sought to assist that sector wherever we possibly can. Including through the extensive on-ground support provided by our healthcare workers, who have now completed more than 5000 shifts, of the state system assisting those private residential aged care services, which are indeed on the ground as we speak. Health minister Martin Foley steps up: Unfortunately, three of today’s cases relate to emerging outbreaks in our private residential aged care sector. One is the son of the initial case – you recall the first case in Maidstone Arcare – he doesn’t work at the facility but is linked. One is a staff member at that same Arcare Maidstone who worked alongside that initial case. She was not vaccinated. She also worked at another aged care facility, the Blue Cross ACG Sunshine facility, on 26 and 27 and 28 of May. That has therefore triggered a strong public health response at the Blue Cross facility, similar to what was activated to contain measures at the Maidstone Arcare facility. And the third, additional case linked to the Arcare outbreak is unfortunately a resident. A woman in her 90s, within the Arcare Maidstone workplace where the initial case worked. She is asymptomatic and has been transferred to a separate hospital that we have established precisely for this risk. Our thoughts are clearly with the resident, with the workforce and communities and families they are all a part of ... indeed, our thoughts are with everyone who is impacted by this virus. This does not sound promising, in terms of the lockdown ending as scheduled. James Merlino: In the past 24 hours we identified many more points of concern. In addition to the very worrying cases in private aged car, we are very concerned about the number of other high-risk exposure sites. We are seeing a small number of cases infecting a large number of contacts. There is no doubt, the situation is incredibly serious. The next few days remain critical. I want to be very clear with everyone, this outbreak may well get worse before it gets better. I’m asking every single Victorian, if you have any symptoms whatsoever, please go and get tested. Check the exposure sites regularly and please keep following the rules to keep you, your family or community and everyone in Victoria safe. This is not over and we need to keep going. I’m just leaving Scott Morrison’s opening remarks from New Zealand, as acting Victorian premier James Merlino has stepped up to update us on the Victorian situation. Merlino: There are currently 54 active cases of coronavirus in Victoria. I can also advise there are a further six locally acquired cases that came through after the late-night cut-off, and a public health teams are urgently investigating and interviewing these cases. Of the cases formally reported today, two relate to the city of Whittlesea outbreak, one is a contact of a previous case linked to the Star car wash and one source of acquisition is under investigation. We are managing 4200 primary close contacts across all of our exposure sites. This is indeed very sad news. Prime ministers Scott Morrison and Jacinda Ardern are holding their press conference following the bilateral talks in New Zealand. We will bring you some of this but will have to return to it later as we’re prioritising the Victorian press conferenceg, which is due to start very soon. Ardern: We have shared our learnings, information and work collaboratively as we navigate COVID-19. The COVID challenge that we all face is writ large at the moment and I did want to acknowledge the people of Victoria and just say that everyone in New Zealand is thinking of you at this time. We have had our fair share of challenges and we understand what it is like when you reach another hurdle, but we have absolute faith it is a hurdle you will come out on the other side of and we look forward to welcoming you back on our shores again soon. Here was Michael McCormack on why the federal government doesn’t need to step in and help Victorian workers through this lockdown: We have already provided $40bn, 40,000 million dollars for Victoria to help their economy, to support their businesses. We provided that, we have done it to make sure that we Victorian businesses going, to keep their employees engaged with those businesses. A week in the scheme of things is not a long time in the whole scheme of things, in an 18-month [period]. Funny - I don’t think landlords and utility companies feel quite the same way about “a week not being a long time in the whole scheme of things’’. Anyone who has lived week-to-week - or day-to-day - with their finances knows EXACTLY how long a deal a week is, in the scheme of things. I don’t know what it would be like to be going through a fourth lockdown, particularly after what Victorians went through last year. But to see the virus back in aged care homes, after everything we saw happen, all the families left heartbroken - it is just devastating. We are all hoping the virus does not spread, and that those who have been diagnosed recover, and swiftly. I am so, so sorry people are going through this again. So that is three aged care workers who have been diagnosed with Covid in Victoria, and one resident (in this latest outbreak). Vulnerable Australians were meant to be vaccinated by Easter. This was reported on Melbourne radio this morning and has been confirmed. Victoria will hold its press conference at 12.15pm. So we’ll dip out of the prime minister’s to bring you that. With Covid cases having now emerged in Victoria’s aged care system, we’ve had readers questioning who some of those staff appear to have been working across multiple facilities. Staff in casual or insecure work who needed to work across multiple facilities to make ends meet were a key factor in Victoria’s second wave last year, which resulted in almost 700 people dying in aged care. As a result, the federal government changed its guidelines for the aged care homes it manages (the majority of aged care homes are federally run). According to the federal government guidelines: Workers who have more than one aged care employer will choose a primary employer – which must be the employer they work most hours per week with, if they are to access Australian government assistance – and that facility will employ them for at least their total normal hours by providing additional hours equal to or greater than the hours they were working elsewhere.’’ But here’s the catch; the guidelines are not mandatory. I’ve contacted the office of the federal aged care minister Richard Colbeck to ask if this policy has changed recently, and whether staff ideally are still required to work at just one facility. Both BlueCross and Arcare in Victoria, where staff have been infected in the current outbreak, are federally funded homes. We are seeking to confirm the BlueCross case, and Arcare issued a statement earlier confirming its cases. An Arcare statement issued on Sunday said there was “limited” staff movement between facilities. My colleague Nino Bucci is trying to confirm with the facility exactly what limited movement means. Meanwhile the Victorian government has a policy for its homes that: “Where practicable, care facility workers should be limited to working at one facility.” So again, not mandatory. We’ll hear from prime minister Scott Morrison at midday (AEST). He’s speaking in New Zealand following his meetings with his counterpart Jacinda Ardern. Michael Daley is back in contention for leadership of the NSW Labor party. You may remember he was forced to apologise after this video surfaced just ahead of the NSW election (which Labor lost) in 2019. Understandably, many Asian-Australian members of the Labor party have a bit to say about the situation and have released this statement: So what we know so far: There are now two workers at the Arcare Maidstone aged care home who have tested positive for Covid One resident at the centre has also tested positive, and has been taken to hospital as a precaution. There is a possible third aged care worker who has tested positive for Covid at another aged care home – Blue Cross Western Gardens. Callers to Melbourne radio stations this morning were talking about that, but we are still waiting for confirmation from Victoria Health. I contacted Victoria’s Department of Health to find out whether the staff member who tested positive for Covid who works at Blue Cross Western Gardens at Sunshine is the same staff member who tested positive at Arcare Maidstone, or whether they are two different separate cases. Staff are still working across different facilities, so it could be that one case is being counted as a positive staff member at both facilities. A spokeswoman from the Department of Health didn’t answer the question, telling me: Please watch out for the press conference later this morning. She did not say what time that would be. This follows Bill Shorten’s interview this morning, where he said he had been informed there were additional cases at the Arcare Maidstone aged care home – the operators have confirmed a second staff member and a resident have tested positive for Covid. Scott Morrison’s office have released the remarks (to the media) he made at the meeting he had with Jacinda Ardern in New Zealand: People often ask us, is this a partnership, it’s far more than a partnership. It is a family relationship between Australia and New Zealand. We have some very serious times that we’re dealing with, not just from the health point of view but obviously from a regional security point of view and Australia and New Zealand take a very prominent role in the Pacific, and I thank you for the relationship we’ve had working on particularly those issues in the Pacific. It is true that Australia and New Zealand has done very well in the course of Covid. But as you can see in Victoria now, those challenges persist. And equally in Fiji, they are dealing with the challenges, and Papua New Guinea, they are dealing with challenges. We’re supporting all of our Pacific family through our vaccine dose delivery into those regions and supporting them in their vaccinations. But the broader issue of the Indo-Pacific and a free and open Indo-Pacific is something Australia and New Zealand feels very strongly about. And working with our like-minded partners all around the world, the United States and the United Kingdom, and as we’re discussing across Europe, Japan and India, all of us have a big stake in ensuring a world that favours freedom and a free and open Indo-Pacific. And so we greatly appreciate the partnership we have to achieve those outcomes. So with those issues all on the table today, we should, we should move on and get on with it. I really appreciate the direct personal relationship and dialogue we’ve had and, and that will only continue because we have common challenges, there are common threats, and that has always I think eclipsed everything when it comes to the strength of the working family relationship. NSW Health has also updated its vaccination numbers NSW has recorded no locally acquired cases in the last 24 hours. Two people in hotel quarantine have tested positive for the virus. Last week I wrote about how overcrowding in Victoria’s healthcare system is a “bigger public health emergency than Covid”, according to a leading emergency physician who says the state’s doctors and nurses were exhausted even before the latest outbreak. The Australasian College for Emergency Medicine Victoria faculty chair, Dr Mya Cubitt, said on Friday that doctors and nurses in public hospitals had been dreading such a situation because they were still recovering from Victoria’s second wave in 2020. She added that the overcrowding issue was occuring Australia-wide. Since the article was published I’ve had emergency healthcare workers contact me sharing their stories, including an emergency department registrar in an inner-city Melbourne hospital. She told me: I would definitely agree that staff are burnt out; our waiting rooms are almost always full now and our patient populations are, generally speaking, older and multi-morbid. The incidence and acuity of people presenting with mental ill health in terms of substance and alcohol misuse, dementia and depression, self-harm and suicidality is certainly higher, which is especially difficult to manage and discharge safely in acuity in the ED, as well as often being emotionally charged and challenging for staff to deal with. The gaping chasm of ill health between either end of socioeconomic spectrum is more evident than ever too; homelessness and the health risk conferred by housing instability is especially challenging this winter following a financially difficult year for so many. A lot of analogies continue to be drawn about how this pandemic is a marathon rather than a sprint, but at least we know a marathon definitely ends after 42km and I think not knowing definitively when normality may resume in our personal and professional lives compounded by widespread discourse and reluctance around vaccinations (like anti-vaxx posters stuck on lamp posts outside the hospital!) exacerbates the challenge.” The registrar said she worked in a London emergency department last year until December, before returning to her family in Melbourne. She has an academic interest in social determinants of health. She told me the sentiment among her Melbourne peers “is that we are all working flat out but especially with young mental health patients the system is so strained and there’s a bubbling consensus that we don’t often feel as though we are really ‘fixing’ someone anymore”. I think in the UK/Europe the legacy of the pandemic will be the deaths and hospitalisations and morbidity from the virus itself which is predominantly an older demographic, whereas here the knock-on effects from lockdown, financial hardship, worsening family violence and social isolation as drivers of significant mental ill-health amongst young people will likely be an issue for a long time to come. I’m not sure what the answer or an alternative would have been though and Australia’s response to avoid a situation like Europe’s at all cost is wholly appropriate – many people, including those now presenting to ED disgruntled with vaccine side effects and sharing their negative experiences, don’t often realise how lucky they are as had they contracted the virus itself they would have likely died.” We are still waiting to hear when the Victorian press conference will be held. There are reports of positive Covid cases in two different aged care homes – but we are still waiting on official confirmation. Given we are still deporting people who were born in New Zealand but came to Australia as babies/small children and lived their entire lives here, if they are convicted of a crime, this is probably not something Scott Morrison will be embracing: Trying to get yourself “cancelled” (something that doesn’t exist) by claiming you have been “cancelled” (refer to previous parentheses) in a little-seen social media post to try and further your political career is sadly not a new tactic. Pauline Hanson is still in the Senate. We are still waiting on the press conference when this will all be confirmed. Uptake of the seasonal flu vaccine in children has risen as a result of increased funding and awareness, according to a paper published today in the Medical Journal of Australia. In 2020, the proportion of flu-vaccinated children aged between six to 59 months rose to 43.9%, representing “a significant improvement from past low vaccination rates”. The annual influenza vaccine is recommended for all Australians aged six months and older, with free vaccines for high-risk groups provided by the national immunisation program. The highest annual hospitalisation rates for the seasonal flu are in infants aged less than six months, followed by children aged between six and 23 months. Until recently, funding for the flu vaccine in children was limited, the report’s authors said. In 2020, the vaccine was added to the national immunisation program for all children aged six to 59 months. The number of influenza vaccine doses available for all Australians has also increased, from 8.3m doses distributed in 2017 to 18m doses in 2020. “Australia needs strategies to improve and sustain high coverage,” the authors wrote. “These could include personalised vaccination reminders and provision of greater access to influenza vaccination services.” Also happening today: Townsville will find out if it will host the State of Origin opener if the lockdown forces the game to be moved from Melbourne. This is an actual federal government announcement for aged care workers. Take a look at the advice for under-50s (who are recommended to have the Pfizer vaccine). You can get a dose, where doses are available. And then hope you can get a second dose, if there are doses left over. If not, kindly work it out. This is the program the federal government is running. In case anyone was wondering, Scott Morrison is still in New Zealand. Australia’s IPL cricket players have completed their quarantine in Sydney and have been released. It has only been 28 days since Michael Slater tweeted this. There are still Australians trying to get home from India (and around the world). We will hear a breakdown of the cases – and whether they are all linked – very soon. These numbers are incredible though – 16,752 vaccines administered and 43,874 tests. Thank you Victoria. You have shouldered such a huge, isolating burden during the past 18 months – and you keep showing up. I can’t pretend to know what it has been like, but I thank you. The numbers have just come in We are at the refreshing of the Victorian Health site stage of the morning while we wait for today’s numbers. So far we have not received confirmation on Bill Shorten’s information that one, possibly two, other people at the Arcare Maidstone aged care home have tested positive for Covid. Everyone is waiting for today’s announcement. Jim Chalmers, who in the last couple of weeks has been labelled a “shadow of a shadow minister” by Josh Frydenberg, who likes to repeat things he finds very clever – but should probably be tested outside the mirror before making their public debut – is doing all he can not to scream “vindication” over the hard stop on jobkeeper in these comments (but not quite getting there). Victorians wouldn’t be in this position if the prime minister had got the vaccination rollout and the quarantine build right from the beginning. I think it’s entirely reasonable that the Victorian people are frustrated, and anxious, and possibly angry. I say to the prime minister that all they expected of Scott Morrison was some competence when it comes to the vaccine rollout and the quarantine bill, and some compassion when it comes to economic support. They’re getting neither competence, nor compassion, from this prime minister. The Victorian business community is being strangled by the prime minister’s failures on vaccinations and quarantine. It didn’t take long for this prime minister and this treasurer to go from “we’re all in this together” to now all of a sudden Victorians are all on their own. This is a treasurer who likes to parade his Victorian credentials when it suits him, when there’s a photo op in it for him, but when Victorians really need this treasurer he’s gone missing once again. Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg are leaving Victorians high and dry in their hour of need. What we want to see is the state government and the federal government working together to provide the necessary support to ensure the Victorians can get through a really difficult period. Jim Chalmers held a doorstop interview this morning to discuss the need for federal financial assistance for workers during Victoria’s lockdown: We have seen the state government come to the table with a support package the federal government should, too. Ideally, there would be some kind of income support, whether it is jobkeeper or perhaps they have got a better way of doing it. We have said all along that economic support should be tailored to the economic conditions. We are worried that this government is very quick to pull economic support, but very slow to roll out the vaccines and take responsibility for quarantine. The other issue bubbling alongside Victoria’s fourth lockdown – sparked by a hotel quarantine breach in Adelaide – is who will support workers who have just lost a week’s worth of pay. Dan Tehan said people could go to Centrelink and apply for a payment – but that is only for people who have been ordered to isolate, or quarantine – not for people in lockdown, who can still leave the house for one of the five essential reasons. (Always better to check these things before saying them on national television.) Josh Frydenberg hasn’t said there will be no assistance – just none right now. This was his response on Facebook yesterday, following criticism from the Victorian government about the Morrison government going MIA: Since the end of jobkeeper Victoria is the third state to introduce a short lockdown. Greater Brisbane was subject to stay-at-home orders from 29 March to 1 April, the Perth metropolitan and Peel region was under stay-at-home orders from 24 to 27 April and Victoria is currently under stay-at-home orders from 28 May to 3 June. In both the Queensland and Western Australian lockdowns further federal support was not required. In the case of Victoria, the Morrison government has provided and continues to provide an unprecedented level of direct economic support. Over $45bn has already flowed to Victorian families and businesses during Covid, with more direct federal economic support per capita going to Victoria than to any other state. The amount of federal government direct economic support delivered to Victoria is around three times what has been delivered by the state government. The federal government continues to provide support to Victorian families and businesses through this pandemic. The pandemic leave disaster payment of $1,500 is available as is the national health emergency crisis payment. For businesses that experience losses, the loss carry-back measure is available to boost cash flow at the end of the financial year. The economic impact of the Victorian outbreak is not insignificant but the budget just over two weeks ago did anticipate further outbreaks would occur. Our budget measures were calibrated accordingly, with the budget providing an additional $41bn of Covid-related economic support. Should extended lockdowns be avoided and outbreaks contained the national economy can continue its strong recovery. The Morrison government will continue to work with the Victorian government and closely monitor the situation. I’m not sure what good it is telling people they received a higher share of financial help previously is, when they need help now. And it is possible other Australian jurisdictions will be in the same spot. The last sentence is the interesting one there – “closely monitor the situation” is usually code for, “if this gets worse, we’ll have to do something”. Which is cold comfort for people who have seen all their shifts disappear, with no warning, just as they were starting to get back on their feet. There are now 268 exposure sites on the Victorian Health website Former Labor MP Emma Husar, who was forced to resign from the federal parliament after “slut-shaming” allegations were reported against her (an investigation into the allegations later found no basis for the salacious claims against her and Husar subsequently won a defamation action against Buzzfeed) wants an apology from Anthony Albanese (as leader) and damages from the Labor party. Bill Shorten was leader at the time, and is asked whether Husar deserves an apology from the Labor party: I do think that Emma – she was on the receiving end of some poor treatment, too. So I have spoken to her in the past. I regret the way she was treated. I don’t say that covers all of the matters, but, yes, I think there were some people in New South Wales Labor who didn’t treat her well. Emma and I have had our own conversations on this matter. I do, in part, feel for her. I don’t think she was all in the wrong here. So is that a yes or no? Listen, Anthony wasn’t the leader then. I am not going the get into that. Certainly for my own view, I think she received some pretty unfair treatment and I am happy to say that. Somehow, the government has managed to get stuck on the word “race” – as in being in competition with something, in this case, a highly contagious virus – and whether Australia is in one when it comes to a vaccine program. Scott Morrison has said on multiple occasions in regards to a vaccine rollout that we are “not in a race” or “this isn’t a race”. The lack of urgency from the government is one reason people are citing for delaying receiving their vaccine if they are eligible. With Victoria in lockdown, the whole country has had a reminder of why we are actually in a fairly urgent situation, because Covid can shut down whole communities and economies at any moment. Shorten was asked by the ABC whether or not Australia was “in a race” when it came to the vaccine this morning: Well, it is now. I think there has been a degree of complacency, not just by the government, but perhaps amongst Australians – if there is no outbreak of Covid then the urge to get the vaccine doesn’t seem as great. We have seen people in Melbourne who are switched on to these matters, the vaccination rates have increased and the queues have got longer because now there is an outbreak. I would suggest to my fellow Australians, once there is an outbreak, queuing up to get the vaccination seems to be too slow, to me. Perhaps we need to get up from our kitchen tables and lounge chairs and I would say to people in states and towns which haven’t had to go through the lockdown that my hometown of Melbourne is going through, don’t wait until the lockdown to get vaccinated. Simple common sense says if there is Covid anywhere it could affect any of us at any time. Bill Shorten is on ABC News Breakfast saying he understands one resident or “possibly two” at the Arcare Maidstone aged care home have tested positive for Covid – as well as an aged care worker. This is not confirmed by Victorian health authorities as yet. Shorten: Worryingly both the staff member who recorded positive but one resident, possibly two, but one resident who appears to have contracted Covid were both vaccinated in the first round, so it just emphasises to me and I think to everyone listening that two vaccinations is what we need and when I heard the federal government saying one vaccination somehow is a goal, well, as I understand it, it is only secondhand reports from the facility, but the people who are sick actually had had a vaccination, so you need two. One is not enough. We should receive the Victorian numbers very soon. Yesterday, there were five locally acquired cases. It’s the mystery case which has authorities worried – cases which can’t be linked to a previous infection tend to be the ones which extend lockdowns. Hopefully we will find out very soon what the state of play is. And the Oz has reported the LNP has blocked Queensland MP George Christensen’s bid for the $105,600 “resettlement” allowance after he announced his decision to quit the federal parliament at the next election. The allowance is open to MPs who are disendorsed or lose their seat – anyone who “retires involuntarily”. Christensen announced his own retirement. Meanwhile, Sarah Martin has an Andrew Laming update: The controversial Liberal MP Andrew Laming, who returned to parliament earlier this month after undergoing empathy training, has defended another $15,000 in grants that went to organisations run by a local LNP branch president, Guardian Australia can reveal. In the latest round of the Stronger Communities grant program in Laming’s electorate, two grants were awarded to Redlands Salad Bowl and Community Connections Redlands Coast, both of which were co-founded by the president of the Liberal National party’s Redlands branch, Craig Luxton. The secretary of both organisations is Laming’s own electorate officer, Stephanie Eaton. Australia is still waiting to learn who its ambassador from the US will be under the Biden administration – Axios has reported it could be a Kennedy. The US media network reports that Caroline Kennedy, who served as a second ambassador to Japan during the Obama administration, is in line for Canberra. AAP has the latest on the mystery Covid case in a Melbourne aged care home: A Melbourne aged care worker’s “mystery case” has authorities worried, as fellow staff members and residents prepare for more COVID-19 testing and vaccinations. Arcare Maidstone residents were locked down and placed into self-isolation on Sunday after a female healthcare worker at the facility tested positive. The Altona woman worked at the site in the city’s northwest on Wednesday and Thursday and may have been infectious at the time. Arcare chief executive Colin Singh said no other staff members or residents had returned positive results but further testing was planned for Tuesday. “We know this is an anxious time, but we ask that you please do not call asking for the results,” Mr Singh wrote in a letter. The Altona woman, one of five local cases reported on Sunday, tested positive despite receiving her first coronavirus jab on May 12. Only a third of Arcare Maidstone’s 110 staff and 53 of 76 residents have been vaccinated so far, and the federal government has brought forward scheduled vaccinations to Monday. Happy Monday, everyone. Welcome back to Guardian Australia – you have a hybrid blog today. Parliament isn’t sitting as it’s Reconciliation Day in the ACT and therefore a public holiday, but all the MPs are still in town, which means you get a dose of politics. But of course, most attention is on Victoria and the fourth lockdown, particularly as authorities try to work out the link to a mystery Covid cases – a person who worked in an aged care facility. People who are vulnerable to Covid were meant to have been vaccinated by Easter. At the end of May, we still have aged care homes where no doses of the vaccine have been administered. What we did get this weekend though, was the deputy prime minister, and senior ministers, argue about whether it should be a “race” or not to vaccinate Australians against a virus which has caused a worldwide pandemic.

Scientists have warned ministers that a third wave of coronavirus may have begun in Britain, casting doubt on plans in England to lift all lockdown restrictions on 21 June, three weeks away. The vaccines minister, Nadhim Zahawi, has refused to deny that some restrictions such as mask wearing and working from home might remain in place to reduce the spread of the virus. Senior scientific advisers believe that, where possible, working from home makes sense beyond June. The number of age discrimination claims taken to employment tribunals has increased dramatically in England and Wales since the Covid lockdown, according to analysis. Redundancies among over-50s have hit an all-time high and more than a million over-50s remain on furlough, leading to fears their jobs may also be at risk. Stuart Lewis, founder of Rest Less, a jobs site for older people, said: “We know that once made redundant, older workers are more likely to drift into long-term unemployment than their younger counterparts. Age is a legally protected characteristic … [but] we know that age is often the last unspoken and accepted form of discrimination in the workplace.” Almost two million private renters fear they will be unable to find another property if they lose their home after the eviction ban is lifted this week, ministers are being warned, with a potential “cliff edge” of homelessness looming in the months ahead. And as the hospitality sector throws its doors back open, pubs, bars, nightclubs and the like are grappling with a shortage of workers, with up to 50% of staff in some businesses not returning to their jobs because they have gone on to something else. Settle in at our live blog for more Covid developments. * * * Bank on some sunshine – Today could be the hottest day of the year so far, with temperatures predicted to soar past 25C on this bank holiday Monday. According to the Met Office, most parts of the country will experience a bright and sunny morning and the sunshine looks likely to continue into the afternoon. Clear skies are set to remain overnight for much of England and Wales. Northern Ireland and parts of Scotland will see some thicker cloud build but remain largely dry. The sunny end to this month is a marked contrast from the rest of May, which has been much wetter and colder than usual. April was unusually dry and cold. * * * Netanyahu on way out? The far-right Israeli politician Naftali Bennett and opposition leader Yair Lapid have agreed to forge a coalition government that would oust the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, after 12 straight years in power during which he has survived repeated attempts to end his career. Bennett wants to annex most of the occupied West Bank, while Lapid is a former TV news anchor and self-proclaimed centrist popular with the country’s secular middle class. If Lapid can bring in other parties in the next three days, he could inform the president, Reuven Rivlin, that he believes he can form a government and go to parliament, the Knesset, for a vote. Netanyahu has called the deal the “scam of the century” – Bennett was his former ally and senior aide. If Lapid ends up failing to announce a government, a fifth Israeli election later this year is a possible outcome. * * * Fire risk cladding still going up – More than 70 schools have been fitted out with combustible plastic foam insulation since it was banned on high-rise apartment blocks after the Grenfell disaster. A study by the insulation manufacturer Rockwool also found about 25 recently built hospitals, care homes and sheltered housing complexes were likely to have been constructed with combustible insulation. Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said it was “major cause for concern”. The Department for Education has unveiled new fire safety proposals for schools that would continue to allow combustible cladding on structures below 18 metres in height. * * * Hunt for Dordogne gunman – Police in France have continued their search for a heavily armed former soldier who allegedly opened fire when officers went to a domestic violence dispute. The man, who had an electronic tag because of a prior domestic violence conviction, was still at large in woodland. “He is athletic and moving quickly,” said Francine Bourra, the mayor of Le Lardin-Saint-Lazare village in the Dordogne region. “Each time there was contact with him, he’s opened fire.” Police told village residents to remain indoors. * * * Alarming news – The BBC has been having problems with Bluetooth proximity sensors that are meant to help with social distancing. A source said that “one started smoking” and they had to be withdrawn from use. “If they can’t handle daily use and start setting on fire or overheating, then they shouldn’t be here.” Others complained they kept going off and were so noisy they disrupted recordings. Said a BBC spokesperson: “We are surprised that a problem with a single electronic device is a news story …” Now there’s a bit of ironic peevishness for you. Today in Focus podcast: Avoiding Trump 2.0 The former Obama adviser Ben Rhodes has travelled the world looking for clues to how the US came to elect Donald Trump and he found parallels everywhere. But is there a way of stopping it from happening again? Lunchtime read: ‘My job shouldn’t have to exist’ The Trussell Trust gave hungry Britons 2.5m food parcels in the last year. A million were for children. Its CEO, Emma Revie, talks about the failure of the benefits system, the strains of the pandemic – and her awe at the people who step up to help. Sport Thomas Tuchel is planning a move for Romelu Lukaku as he considers how to build a dynasty at Chelsea and mould a side capable of challenging for the Premier League title next season after winning the Champions League on Saturday night. Naomi Osaka has been fined $15,000 (£10,570) for her refusal to “honour her contractual media obligations” following victory in her first-round match at the French Open. Dominic Thiem became the first big name to fall at Roland Garros after throwing away a two-set lead to lose in five sets to Pablo Andújar in the first round of the men’s tournament. Jimmy Anderson approaches the latest milestones of his record-breaking career with an acknowledgment of his good fortune regarding injury and an insistence that his preference has always been to do it the hard way. After the disruption of 2020, the first Grand Tour of the cycling season marked a return to something approaching business as usual as Egan Bernal secured the Giro d’Italia title by a margin of 1m 29s after the closing time trial in Milan. Hal Robson-Kanu will not repeat his heroics at the European Championship this summer after being left out of the 26-man Wales squad for this summer’s tournament. Roared on by the first home fans to populate Sandy Park for five months, the rampant Exeter Chiefs proved far too much for Newcastle in a 74-3 Premiership demolition. Harlequins clinched their first Premier 15s title to erase memories of two defeats against a Saracens side that had beaten them in the last two finals. And the Moto3 rider Jason Dupasquier has died as a result of injuries sustained in an accident during qualifying on Saturday, MotoGP has announced. Business Major Asia-Pacific stock markets have fallen after Japan reported weaker-than-expected growth in factory output and Chinese manufacturing growth was flat. Benchmarks in Shanghai, Tokyo and Hong Kong retreated while Seoul swung between small gains and losses. It’s bank holiday Monday in London, of course. The pound is worth $1.419 and €1.163.

A hastily scheduled hearing in the federal court was initially due to go ahead on Monday, but was scrapped after intense backroom negotiations between the two parties. The settlement comes just a day before the court was due to hear a strike-out application over the public broadcaster’s defence. In a statement, the ABC said Porter had “decided to discontinue his defamation action against the ABC and Louise Milligan” and that it “stands by the importance of the article, which reported on matters of significant public interest”. While it said no damages would be paid, the Four Corners article has been amended to include an editor’s note admitting the article was about Porter but that it did “not intend to suggest that Mr Porter had committed the criminal offences alleged”. “On 26 February 2021, the ABC published an article by Louise Milligan.

Porter announced he would sue the public broadcaster and journalist Louise Milligan in March, over an article alleging an unnamed cabinet minister had been accused of rape in January 1988 in a dossier sent to Scott Morrison and three other MPs.

He takes us on the road with him in this series, opening in New Zealand, where he visits the farm of the Jurassic Park actor Sam Neill and tries diving into the sea using the “manu bomb” manoeuvre.

As I left her home in Mexico City, she stood waving on the doorstep. Today, I’m back for the first time – to see Leonora’s house recreated as a visitor attraction. It feels surreal, but the surreal has become the everyday since I set off to find Leonora in 2006, almost 70 years after she checked out of our family and Britain. She travelled first to Paris to be with her lover, the German artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/aug/31/max-ernst-anti-traditionalist-1961\">Max Ernst</a>, before moving on to Mexico with a diplomat she met after she and Ernst were separated by the second world war.</p> <p>This house, 194 Calle Chihuahua, is where she was anchored for more than 60 years. Here, she painted some of her best-known works, including <a href=\"http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2015/latin-america-modern-art-n09428/lot.10.html\">The Juggler</a>, which sold at auction in 2005 for £436,000; <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/collection/works/393384\">And Then We Saw the Daughter of the Minotaur</a>, now at MoMA in New York; and her mural The Magical World of the Mayans, now at the National Anthropological Museum in Mexico City. </p> <p>As well as being a pivotal figure in the surrealist movement, Leonora was a sculptor, textile artist and writer – it was in this house, too, that she wrote The Hearing Trumpet, deemed by the Guardian to be one of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/series/1000novels\">1,000 novels to read before you die</a>. And it was here that she raised her children, two sons, by the man she married in Mexico, a Hungarian photographer called Chiki Weisz.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"317657eb9288bbfebe8081ba36827b36f82ff782\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/317657eb9288bbfebe8081ba36827b36f82ff782/0_278_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘Her worlds were beautiful, scary, profound’\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Her worlds were beautiful, scary, profound’ … the house is full of Carrington’s sculpture.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Claudio Cruz/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The house is still filled with her sculpture: weird and wacky pieces, including a maquette of How Doth the Little Crocodile, named after the Lewis Carroll poem. Leonora held court at this address, the most exotic of the 1940s artist-émigrés who Frida Kahlo, the incumbent queen of Mexican art, dismissed as “those European bitches”. </p> <p>The £3m restoration, by the Metropolitan Autonomous University of Mexico (UAM), is now almost complete and I’ve been invited here to work on various connected projects before its opening later this year. (Virtual visits are already possible.) It feels very strange, being back here without Leonora. In the kitchen – the engine room of her world, where we spent so many hours sitting chatting – her teacup, glasses and some letters are on the table in front of her empty chair. There’s a cigarette in the ashtray. I’m half expecting her to come in, sit down, relight her cigarette and say: “So, what’s the news today?”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"232a20bdc06c0e1496cfacc5e445bc665b617e07\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/232a20bdc06c0e1496cfacc5e445bc665b617e07/1026_0_2266_2832/800.jpg\" alt=\"The most exotic of the 1940s artist-émigrés … Carrington’s courtyard, featuring her sculpture Woman with Pigeon.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The most exotic of the 1940s artist-émigrés … Carrington’s courtyard, featuring her sculpture Woman with Pigeon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Claudio Cruz/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Leonora was 94 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/may/27/leonora-carrington-surrealist-dies#:~:text=She%20was%20awarded%20an%20OBE,and%20the%20arts%20in%20Mexico.\">when she died</a>, but her curiosity never wavered. She was far more interested in talking about politics – or world events, or the newspaper vendor down the street, or her dog Yeti’s latest escapades – than she was about Ernst or Picasso or Dalí or Duchamp, all of whom she had known in Paris. Every day with her was an adventure: she lived absolutely in the moment, always on the lookout for glimpses of ridiculousness or oddness or fun.</p> <p>On the kitchen shelves, her jars of spices, with her handwritten labels, still stand. Taped to the cupboard doors, just as they always were, are a selection of postcards including some of the royal family, one of them doctored so Prince Charles – who gave Leonora her OBE on a visit to Mexico in 2000 – is sporting a balaclava. People used to ask if they were they ironic. Perhaps so, but part of Leonora missed her homeland. Indeed, in The Hearing Trumpet, her alter ego-protagonist Marian Leatherby, 92, dreams of escaping to Europe from the Spanish-speaking country she was transported to many years before.</p> <p>You’ll have a sense of how 194 Chihuahua feels if you’ve seen Roma, Alfonso Cuarón’s Oscar-winning film from 2018. It is set in a house a few streets away: both have the same Bauhaus-style architecture, the same leaded windows, the same internal courtyard, the same open staircase to the rooftop world where the washing is done, and hung in the blazing sunshine to dry. In Leonora’s time, the roof terrace was the realm of Yolanda, her housekeeper. Today, it’s a spacious paved area where Leonora’s sculptures stands guard.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"97645a044d27e08c363fa26e82bd85a0940abc04\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97645a044d27e08c363fa26e82bd85a0940abc04/0_323_4208_2525/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Foliage and a four-legged friend … another courtyard.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Foliage and four-legged friends … another courtyard.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Casa Estudio Leonora Carrington UAM</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The most intimate view into Leonora’s world comes when you step into her first-floor bedroom, off a narrow, tiled, external corridor. Nowhere is the natural frugality of her approach to life better displayed than in this simple room, with its single bed, a few chairs, table and cabinet. Her husband Chiki, by the end, slept next door; he died in 2007. The only item of abundance in Leonora’s bedroom is books: they cover the shelves along the far wall, just as they cover the walls of her sitting room and the study where the typewriter, on which she wrote The Hearing Trumpet, sits on a table.</p> <p>The books are perhaps the best insight the house offers into her mind: they range from the contemporary novels she loved (Ian McEwan, Doris Lessing and Margaret Atwood were all favourites) to the books that informed her art: tomes on the occult, gnosticism, kabbalah, tarot, herbalism and shamanism; titles on Renaissance art and various movements; as well as the work of her friends, including the photographers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/mar/28/the-big-picture-lee-miller-self-portrait-with-sphinxes-vogue-blitz-second-world-war\">Lee Miller</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/jun/18/surrealist-muses-who-roared-mexico\">Kati Horna</a>, the painter Remedios Varo, and the Nobel prizewinning Octavio Paz. Birds with Human Faces and Birds with Human Souls share shelf space with The Book of Owls and Expert Obedience Training for Dogs.

I actually knew more about her writing than her paintings.” The house was bought by UAM complete with more than 8,600 objects, ranging from clothes to phonebooks, from half-finished artworks to diaries that recorded her dreams. Combing through the minutiae of Leonora’s life has given Alejandra insights into the life of someone she never met, but now thinks about every day. </p> <p>“I feel very connected to her,” she says. “She was a very congruent person: what she believed, she lived. Because of the themes of her art – the occult and so on – people sometimes think she was complicated. But I don’t think she was. She was instinctive: she believed in feelings and following them.”</p> <p>Excitingly for the increasing number of art historians and academics interested in Leonora’s work, the Casa Estudio Leonora Carrington, as 194 is now known, includes a study centre on that surprisingly spacious roof terrace.

As I left her home in Mexico City, she stood waving on the doorstep. Today, I’m back for the first time – to see Leonora’s house recreated as a visitor attraction. It feels surreal, but the surreal has become the everyday since I set off to find Leonora in 2006, almost 70 years after she checked out of our family and Britain. She travelled first to Paris to be with her lover, the German artist Max Ernst, before moving on to Mexico with a diplomat she met after she and Ernst were separated by the second world war. This house, 194 Calle Chihuahua, is where she was anchored for more than 60 years. Here, she painted some of her best-known works, including The Juggler, which sold at auction in 2005 for £436,000; And Then We Saw the Daughter of the Minotaur, now at MoMA in New York; and her mural The Magical World of the Mayans, now at the National Anthropological Museum in Mexico City. As well as being a pivotal figure in the surrealist movement, Leonora was a sculptor, textile artist and writer – it was in this house, too, that she wrote The Hearing Trumpet, deemed by the Guardian to be one of the 1,000 novels to read before you die. And it was here that she raised her children, two sons, by the man she married in Mexico, a Hungarian photographer called Chiki Weisz. The house is still filled with her sculpture: weird and wacky pieces, including a maquette of How Doth the Little Crocodile, named after the Lewis Carroll poem. Leonora held court at this address, the most exotic of the 1940s artist-émigrés who Frida Kahlo, the incumbent queen of Mexican art, dismissed as “those European bitches”. The £3m restoration, by the Metropolitan Autonomous University of Mexico (UAM), is now almost complete and I’ve been invited here to work on various connected projects before its opening later this year. (Virtual visits are already possible.) It feels very strange, being back here without Leonora. In the kitchen – the engine room of her world, where we spent so many hours sitting chatting – her teacup, glasses and some letters are on the table in front of her empty chair. There’s a cigarette in the ashtray. I’m half expecting her to come in, sit down, relight her cigarette and say: “So, what’s the news today?” Leonora was 94 when she died, but her curiosity never wavered. She was far more interested in talking about politics – or world events, or the newspaper vendor down the street, or her dog Yeti’s latest escapades – than she was about Ernst or Picasso or Dalí or Duchamp, all of whom she had known in Paris. Every day with her was an adventure: she lived absolutely in the moment, always on the lookout for glimpses of ridiculousness or oddness or fun. On the kitchen shelves, her jars of spices, with her handwritten labels, still stand. Taped to the cupboard doors, just as they always were, are a selection of postcards including some of the royal family, one of them doctored so Prince Charles – who gave Leonora her OBE on a visit to Mexico in 2000 – is sporting a balaclava. People used to ask if they were they ironic. Perhaps so, but part of Leonora missed her homeland. Indeed, in The Hearing Trumpet, her alter ego-protagonist Marian Leatherby, 92, dreams of escaping to Europe from the Spanish-speaking country she was transported to many years before. You’ll have a sense of how 194 Chihuahua feels if you’ve seen Roma, Alfonso Cuarón’s Oscar-winning film from 2018. It is set in a house a few streets away: both have the same Bauhaus-style architecture, the same leaded windows, the same internal courtyard, the same open staircase to the rooftop world where the washing is done, and hung in the blazing sunshine to dry. In Leonora’s time, the roof terrace was the realm of Yolanda, her housekeeper. Today, it’s a spacious paved area where Leonora’s sculptures stands guard. The most intimate view into Leonora’s world comes when you step into her first-floor bedroom, off a narrow, tiled, external corridor. Nowhere is the natural frugality of her approach to life better displayed than in this simple room, with its single bed, a few chairs, table and cabinet. Her husband Chiki, by the end, slept next door; he died in 2007. The only item of abundance in Leonora’s bedroom is books: they cover the shelves along the far wall, just as they cover the walls of her sitting room and the study where the typewriter, on which she wrote The Hearing Trumpet, sits on a table. The books are perhaps the best insight the house offers into her mind: they range from the contemporary novels she loved (Ian McEwan, Doris Lessing and Margaret Atwood were all favourites) to the books that informed her art: tomes on the occult, gnosticism, kabbalah, tarot, herbalism and shamanism; titles on Renaissance art and various movements; as well as the work of her friends, including the photographers Lee Miller and Kati Horna, the painter Remedios Varo, and the Nobel prizewinning Octavio Paz. Birds with Human Faces and Birds with Human Souls share shelf space with The Book of Owls and Expert Obedience Training for Dogs. (I’m not sure that one was deployed to best effect on Yeti.) “I knew she was a surrealist,” says Dr Alejandra Osorio, director of the project. “And that was about it. I actually knew more about her writing than her paintings.” The house was bought by UAM complete with more than 8,600 objects, ranging from clothes to phonebooks, from half-finished artworks to diaries that recorded her dreams. Combing through the minutiae of Leonora’s life has given Alejandra insights into the life of someone she never met, but now thinks about every day. “I feel very connected to her,” she says. “She was a very congruent person: what she believed, she lived. Because of the themes of her art – the occult and so on – people sometimes think she was complicated. But I don’t think she was. She was instinctive: she believed in feelings and following them.” Excitingly for the increasing number of art historians and academics interested in Leonora’s work, the Casa Estudio Leonora Carrington, as 194 is now known, includes a study centre on that surprisingly spacious roof terrace. Alejandra thinks one especially fertile area of research could be searching through Leonora’s annotated books to find links with her paintings. That makes me laugh, because Leonora famously refused to discuss what her paintings meant. Death may yet reveal her in a way she refused to be revealed in her lifetime. My instinct is that she wouldn’t have minded: she always told me she wasn’t interested in dwelling on what would happen after she’d gone.

The concert hall was known until 1916 as Bechstein Hall, after the German piano manufacturer whose showrooms were next door and which had built the hall. Bechstein was forced to cease trading in Britain during the first world war and the venue was sold and renamed Wigmore Hall and opened under the new title in 1917. In these past 120 years it has become established as one of the world’s great recital venues. Stephen Hough, 1 June 2020 “Great buildings catch the eye but great concert halls must catch the ear, too … A fine acoustic does not just make the music created on stage sound better: it is part of the creative process itself.” So opens Stephen Hough’s 2019 book, Rough Ideas. Here is Stephen reading that first chapter and, above, a link to his own arrangement of Bach/Gounod’s Ave Maria performed from an empty hall – in a concert that was the first live performance on BBC Radio 3 since Britain’s initial March 2020 lockdown. It thus marked an end to the national musical silence. It was a glimmer of hope for the industry and a profoundly moving experience. Adair Concerts, 1921-28 The Adair concerts were a series of Sunday entertainments for first world war veterans who who had physical and psychological wounds, what is now called PTSD. The programmes included magicians, impersonators, ventriloquists, bell ringers, singers and ensembles. Free cigarettes were distributed, probably Woodbines. One of the charms of this flyer is the important notice that smokers are urgently requested not to drop ash on the upholstery or carpets. The all-important raffle guaranteed a full house. The concerts were organised by the entertainer Basil Leakey, known as Alan Adair. We hope to organise future concerts and outreach work for 21st-century veterans. Lotte Lehmann, 1957 and 1959 Celebrated German soprano Lotte Lehmann gave masterclasses in 1957 and 1959, which were hugely popular with students and audiences. A young soprano (later a mezzo-soprano), Grace Bumbry, was a participant in the first, and here is pictured with Lehmann. Bumbry became a trailblazer for a generation of African American singers and went on to perform in leading opera houses across the world. In 1959, a 25-year-old Janet Baker took part in Lehmann’s masterclass. The British-born mezzo – now Dame Janet – recently celebrated her 85th birthday with this remarkably candid interview at the Wigmore Hall, in conversation with the actor Simon Callow. Amadeus String Quartet, 10 January 1948 Arguably one of the greatest string quartets of the 20th century, the Amadeus’s members included three Jewish refugees who had been driven out of Vienna after Hitler’s Anschluss of 1938. Norbert Brainin, Siegmund Nissel, Peter Schidlof and Martin Lovett made more than 200 celebrated recordings covering repertoire by Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert as well as 20th-century greats Bartók and Britten, who wrote his last string quartet for them, which premiered directly after his death in 1976. By coincidence, Britten is buried alongside conductor and composer Imogen Holst, who underwrote the costs of the debut recital of the Amadeus Quartet given here at the Wigmore Hall in 1948. Samuel Coleridge-Taylor, 1902-10 Samuel Coleridge-Taylor, known as the African Mahler, was a frequent visitor to the hall in its first decade, often appearing in performances of his own works; his song collections and his works for violin were extremely popular. He wrote his remarkable Nonet in F minor for oboe, clarinet, bassoon, horn, violin, viola, cello, double bass and piano in 1893 when he was only 18 years old. Here – above - is a sparking account of the Nonet, recorded in an empty hall on 1 August 2020 with Wigmore Hall associate ensemble, the Kaleidoscope Chamber Collective. David Bowie, 22 May 1969 A 23-year-old experimental musician and artist appeared in the final number of a concert given by folk musician Tim Hollier and singer Amory Kane. His name was David Bowie, and he was only a few months away from releasing his groundbreaking single Space Oddity. Perhaps an unexpected figure in the hall’s history, it was not his first appearance because, the previous year, he had performed here with his multi-media folk and mime trio, Feathers. His 1969 appearance saw him take to the stage not as a musician, but as a dancer. As Hollier, Kane, guitarist Rick Cuff and drummer Clem Cattini played the evening’s final song, Evolution, Bowie donned a space suit to perform a contemporary, balletic dance which may have represented a journey towards rebirth, removing pieces of his costume as the piece progressed. Marian Anderson, 15 June 1928 Described by the conductor Arturo Toscanini as possessing a voice “..heard once in a hundred years”, the American contralto Marian Anderson gave her Wigmore Hall debut on 15 June 1928 was a regular visitor here thereafter and a key figure in the struggle of African American artists against racism in the US during the mid 20th-century. She was once refused permission to sing to an integrated audience on Washington’s Constitution Hall, she went on to become the first black soloist to sing at the Metropolitan Opera in New York. In this debut programme she performed African American spirituals alongside Purcell, Schubert, Schumann, Debussy and music by British composer Roger Quilter, with the composer himself at the piano. The World League for Sexual Reform Congress, 1929 This Berlin-based World League for Sexual Reform coordinated a policy for greater openness around sexual equality, led by Magnus Hirschfeld, the German physician and sexologist. He presided over the league’s third international congress in London, attended by many leading British feminists. Other London venues did refuse the congress, and the Wigmore’s management was hesitant before agreeing to take the booking. Lasting several days, presentations were given by physicians and school principals as well as eminent writers including George Bernard Shaw and Bertrand Russell, while HG Wells, Hugh Walpole and Aldous Huxley sent in their endorsements. The congress concluded that it was against all kinds of censorship on sex subjects in literature, scientific publications, picture and other representations. It also declared that no campaign for sexual emancipation was possible without sexual education of young people, and that education should not only enlighten the young as to scientific facts, but also awaken in each individual a sense of personal responsibility in regard to his or her sexual life and social relations. Many of the league’s books and records were destroyed at its headquarters during a Nazi raid in 1933, and the league was abolished in 1935. Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, 2 May 1948 One of the foremost lieder singers of her time, and celebrated in Viennese operetta and operas of Mozart, Wagner and Richard Strauss, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf was a huge champion of the Austrian composer Hugo Wolf (1860-1903). This signed photograph of her is in the Wigmore archives along with this charming, undated, handwritten account of her debut recital. I gave my first London recital in this Wigmore Hall a long time ago – 2 May 1948. It was presented by the Philharmonia Concert Society; in that same series Dinu Lipatti played his first and only London recital. It is pleasant to return to places where one has been happy, particularly to a hall where the acoustics are so good. This programme may at first glance seem strange for you.

English Poetry of Many Ages, 14 May 1946 This is one of my favourite programmes in the archive, for an event arranged by the Society of Authors, and given by a company of poets and actors. Readers included John Gielgud and Edith Evans alongside TS Eliot, Dylan Thomas and Louis MacNeice reading their own work. The Times critic noted: “If the second part of the programme, that was devoted to contemporary work, declined in splendour, it was more the fault of the poets than the poetry. Mr C Day Lewis, Mr Louis MacNeice and Mr Dylan Thomas came off much better in reading their own work than Mr Walter De La Mare, Mr TS Eliot, and Miss Edith Sitwell.” The Queen, and the young princesses, Elizabeth and Margaret, were present for this remarkable event.

Genomic sequencing links all these cases to a man who was infected while staying in an Adelaide quarantine hotel.</p> \n  <p>As Melbourne moves into a second week of lockdown, it’s worth asking why we’re back in this all too familiar situation. Two issues that loom the largest in explaining how we got here are a hotel quarantine system that clearly doesn’t work as well as it could, and a more concerning virus variant that seems to have taken full advantage of the time it circulated undetected from the Wollert man to case number five – the key piece of rotten luck in this outbreak.

The WHO said the emergency use listing gives countries, funders, procuring agencies and communities assurance that the vaccine has met international standards. Last month Sinopharm became the first Chinese vaccine to be approved by the WHO. The GAVI vaccine alliance is in talks with Sinovac to expand the Covax dose-sharing portfolio available to poor countries following the WHO approval. India has reported 132,788 new cases over the past 24 hours, and an additional 3,207 deaths. China has reported 24 new cases, including 10 domestic cases all in Guangdong province where authorities have imposed localised lockdown measures to control an outbreak. International flights to Vietnam’s two biggest cities are to resume, reversing a short-lived ban imposed over fears of a new coronavirus wave. AstraZeneca has said it would soon provide Thailand with 1.8m doses of locally manufactured Covid-19 vaccine, the first of multiple batches this month, just days out from the launch of its mass vaccination drive. Germany’s top diplomat in Taipei has said his government has been helping in talks between Taiwan and drugmaker BioNTech to supply Covid-19 vaccines, after Taiwan said a deal fell apart earlier this year due to Chinese “intervention”. Taiwan announced 372 new cases and 12 deaths in its latest daily update. Poland will raise the limit for the number of guests at large gatherings such as weddings to 150 from 50 from 6 June. People who have been vaccinated against the coronavirus will not be counted as part of this limit Russia’s single-dose Sputnik Light vaccine has been approved for use in Mauritius. Russia’s third vaccine, CoviVac, is more than 80% effective, according to preliminary data. Mexico has revised its death count, adding 4,272 fatalities. The clinical review of past deaths, by a team of doctors and nurses, is largely a record-keeping exercise. The Victorian government in Australia will now require people to check in at retail stores and supermarkets regardless of the length of time they spend in the store, as new data reveals a huge increase in check-ins to the Service Victoria app once the state forced businesses to begin using it. The Victorian government in Australia will now require people to check in at retail stores and supermarkets regardless of the length of time they spend in the store, as new data reveals a huge increase in check-ins to the Service Victoria app once the state forced businesses to begin using it. As part of the extension of the lockdown in Melbourne, the acting premier, James Merlino, announced on Wednesday that supermarkets and retailers would be required to make everyone check in when they entered into the store. Previously it was only a recommendation. After the state recorded a number of Covid-19 transmissions at retail stores where the contacts had “fleeting” contact, Victoria’s chief health officer, Prof Brett Sutton, said the change was to ensure records of everyone at potential exposure sites were complete. “We are in a position now where the Victorian community is motivated to do the right thing and they understand the importance of contact tracing in this space,” he said. “And even though we have been doing really well in identifying people at all exposure sites, I think everyone recognises that we have to do absolutely everything in our power to be able to chase down every single person who may be exposed because it is that one person who is not found who may be the one who spreads it.” The Victorian government launched its Covid QR-code check-in app, Service Victoria, at the end of November 2020 but continued to allow hospitality venues to to use their own QR-code systems to record people visiting. Read more of Josh Taylor’s report here: Victoria makes Covid check-in mandatory at shops after transmissions from ‘fleeting’ visits Drugmaker AstraZeneca has said it would soon provide Thailand with 1.8m doses of locally manufactured Covid-19 vaccine, the first of multiple batches this month, just days out from the launch of its mass vaccination drive. The announcement in a joint statement by AstraZeneca and Siam Bioscience, a firm owned by Thailand’s king, comes amid public anxiety about vaccine supplies, as the country suffers its most severe outbreak so far. The statement did not say whether the Thai plant would make all 6m doses that Thailand’s government has promised would be available this month. Reuters report that the government’s immunisation drive starts on Monday and relies almost entirely on its reserved 61m doses of AstraZeneca vaccine, the majority of which it said would come from Siam Bioscience, which is making vaccines for the first time. Questions about Siam Bioscience meeting production targets are sensitive because King Maha Vajiralongkorn is its sole owner. Insulting Thailand’s monarchy is a crime punishable by up to 15 years in prison. Thai health minister Anutin Charnvirakul said on Wednesday the promised 6m doses would come this month “as planned”, but did not specify delivery dates or how many would be sourced locally. “We will get AstraZeneca vaccine. It may come from wherever, but all AstraZeneca just the same. It could be made in Thailand or imported from overseas. It depends on AstraZeneca’s supply chain,” Anutin told reporters. A one-liner from Reuters here that Russia’s single-dose Sputnik Light vaccine against Covid-19 has been approved for use in Mauritius, Russia’s RDIF sovereign wealth fund, which markets the shot internationally, said today. Germany’s top diplomat in Taipei has said his government has been helping in talks between Taiwan and drugmaker BioNTech to supply Covid-19 vaccines, after Taiwan said a deal fell apart earlier this year due to Chinese “intervention”. China denied that accusation. But a war of words escalated after Taiwan rejected Beijing’s offer to supply it with shots made by Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group, which holds a contract to sell them in Greater China. In a Facebook post in Chinese on Wednesday, Thomas Prinz, Germany’s de facto ambassador to Taiwan, said they had “noticed the recent controversy regarding vaccine acquisition”. “Please believe that the German government, especially federal economy minister Altmaier himself, have made great efforts in the continuous communication and coordination between Taiwan and BioNTech,” he said, adding that whether a contract is eventually signed would depend on the two parties, report Reuters. “If the parties to the contract can reach a consensus, the federal government is naturally happy to see it happen.” Nicola Slawson has opened up our UK live blog for the day, which is immediately leading with the debate over the government’s plan for post-pandemic “catch-up” education provision in England. You can follow that with her here: I’ll be continuing here with the latest coronavirus developments from around the world. My colleague Frances Ryan writes for us this morning about how transformational being able to work from home has been life-changing for disabled people, and says don’t take it away now: At the start of the first lockdown, I reported that society was opening up to millions of disabled and chronically ill people as “virtual living” became the norm – from Zoom job interviews and streamed gigs and theatre to NHS phone appointments. But just as it took the non-disabled public to experience a dose of what disabled people have for years before access was improved, the fear is that any gains made during the pandemic will be discarded now that the wider public no longer need them themselves. Take work for example. The shift to working at home over the past year brought new opportunities to those previously excluded from the workforce. As one woman with agoraphobia told me: “Lockdown has opened my world” – it allowed her to get a job from her front room. But as ministers and some employers push for a return to the office, many disabled workers are worried their hard-won progress will go backwards. A research scientist with endometriosis and IBS told me her employer has already stopped letting her work from home full-time, even though her job can be done remotely. “The office is ‘going back to normal’ and they don’t want us at home even though I can do a better job [here],” she said. The Zoom pub quiz became a cliche of lockdown, but what many of us did informally with friends was also replicated by companies, with art exhibitions streaming online or bars running virtual club nights. As venues open back up, I’m hearing from scores of disabled people losing out.

The main Covid focus in England today hasn’t been the pandemic itself, but government proposals to help pupils “catch-up” on learning they may have missed. The package has been roundly criticised, as Haroon Siddique reports: The £1.4bn announced for the post-pandemic catch-up programme for pupils in England is “pitiful” and a fraction of that committed by other countries to help children’s education, a school leaders’ union has said. Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), hit out at the government on Wednesday as it faced scrutiny over why the money is about a 10th of the £15bn total understood to have been recommended by the education recovery commissioner, Sir Kevan Collins. Barton said the government package was “dispiriting” and accused the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, of having lower ambitions for children than those of his union’s members. “It’s pretty pitiful, only yesterday we were hearing stories about extending the school day and even if some people disagreed with it, at least there was a sense of ‘let’s do something radical, let’s do something different’,” he told Sky News. “Today’s announcement essentially equates to £50 per head, you compare that with the USA which is putting £1,600 per head, per young person, or the Netherlands, £2,500 per head. So what is it about those children in the Netherlands or the USA that makes them worth more than our government seems to say? It’s time to stop the rhetoric I think and start the action on behalf of children and young people.” During a series of interviews of Wednesday, Williamson struggled to explain the discrepancy between the announced government spending and that recommended by Collins, who was appointed in February by Downing Street to lead efforts to make up for the damage done by the coronavirus pandemic, particularly to pupils from more deprived backgrounds.

People who have been vaccinated against the coronavirus will not be counted as part of this limit, Reuters report that Adam Niedzielski told a news conference. Many countries in the world have been looking on enviously at the very small number of cases in Australia over recent months, but a new cluster has left people asking questions about the country’s approach. Michael Toole writes for us this morning: Just two weeks ago, Australians were living in a Covid-19-free environment that was unthinkable this time last year. Even in Melbourne, people were once again meeting family and friends at cafes, pubs and cinemas. Football games were played in front of packed stadiums. But that came to an abrupt halt when a new cluster of cases was identified in Melbourne early last week. This outbreak has now grown to 60 known cases across the greater metropolitan area, including several aged care workers and two residents. Genomic sequencing links all these cases to a man who was infected while staying in an Adelaide quarantine hotel. As Melbourne moves into a second week of lockdown, it’s worth asking why we’re back in this all too familiar situation. Two issues that loom the largest in explaining how we got here are a hotel quarantine system that clearly doesn’t work as well as it could, and a more concerning virus variant that seems to have taken full advantage of the time it circulated undetected from the Wollert man to case number five – the key piece of rotten luck in this outbreak. Add to that a painfully slow rollout of vaccines and, deeply worryingly, the related lack of attention to the safety of aged care home residents and staff. Read more here: Michael Toole – Australia is in a race against Covid-19. I’m waiting to hear the starting gun International flights to Vietnam’s two biggest cities are to resume, AFP reports, reversing a short-lived ban imposed over fears of a new coronavirus wave. The Civil Aviation Administration of Vietnam on Monday announced a temporary suspension for international passenger arrivals at Hanoi’s Noi Bai airport from 1-7 June. A similar decision was in force for the airport in commercial capital Ho Chi Minh City until 14 June, as the country struggles to contain a virus outbreak in more than half of its territories. But today the aviation authority told airports and airlines that it had reversed the suspension, without mentioning a timeframe or giving an explanation. Vietnam has managed to keep infection rates low, but cases have more than doubled in the past month and now stand at more than 7,500, with 48 deaths. With less than two months left until the start of the Tokyo Olympic Games, Japan’s Asahi Breweries still doesn’t know whether fans will be allowed into stadiums to buy its beer. Japan has scaled back its Olympic plans amid the pandemic and a slow national vaccine rollout. Foreign spectators won’t be allowed in the country and organisers have yet to decide how many domestic spectators, if any, can attend. More than 60 Japanese companies together paid a record of more than $3bn to sponsor the Tokyo Games, an event most Japanese want cancelled or delayed again. Sponsors paid another $200m to extend contracts after the Games were delayed last year. Many are uncertain how to proceed with advertising campaigns or marketing events, according to 12 officials and sources at companies directly involved in sponsorship who spoke to Reuters. Asahi has the exclusive rights to sell beer, wine and non-alcoholic beer at the stadiums, but even if spectators are allowed, the Tokyo government has no plans to allow alcohol at its public viewing sites outside venues, a representative said. Sponsors have grown frustrated with what they see as slow decision-making and have complained to the organisers, Eimi Yamamitsu and Maki Shiraki report. “There are so many different scenarios that we can’t prepare,” said the source. Some domestic firms, worried about opposition to the Games, have called off plans for commercials featuring Olympic athletes or supporting Japanese national teams, said a person with direct knowledge of the matter. “I’m worried that by airing Olympic ads, it could be negative for the company,” said a source at a domestic sponsor. “At this point, no amount of publicity we could get would make up for what we paid.” Some top-tier global sponsors, whose contracts run until 2024, are scaling down Tokyo promotions and deferring budgets for Beijing in 2022 or Paris in 2024, said a second person with direct knowledge of the matter, and the employee of the sponsor company who was briefed on the issue. But domestic sponsors don’t have another Olympics. “That’s why we can’t simply quit,” said the source at the domestic sponsor. Bit of a reporting chain here, but Reuters is quoting Interfax saying that Russia’s third vaccine against Covid-19, CoviVac, is more than 80% effective according to preliminary data. The Chumakov Centre could produce six times more than the previously planned 10m doses of the vaccine a year, Interfax added. Australia’s Covid vaccination programme has lacked urgency at every stage, with the government forced to revise its own targets and never seeming to meet its own goals. Victoria’s latest outbreak has exposed Scott Morrison government’s failure to successfully get the vaccine out to even the most vulnerable in the community. The outbreak has hit unvaccinated aged care workers, despite federal promises they would be vaccinated by March. Along with mixed messages about the urgency of getting Australia vaccinated, the Morrison government became mired in a debate about whether Australia’s coronavirus vaccination rollout is or is not a race. Our multimedia team has put together this video report: Taiwan has announced 372 new cases of Covid-19 and 12 deaths in its latest daily update. The CECC also announced 177 cases across the preceding five days from the backlog of test results. The number is a significant increase from yesterday, when 262 new cases were reported, with just 65 from the backlog. The backlog is clearing, authorities have assured, but in the meantime it has continued to cause problems in analysis of trends and response measures. Health and welfare minister Chen Shih-Chung said it wasn’t clear if today’s rise was due to an increase in cases or faster reporting times, local media said. Chen also gave some updates about Taiwan’s vaccination process – a complicated issue, which involves accusations of geopolitical interference as well as of government bungling. The government has procured around 1m doses so far for 23.5 million people, and has ordered tens of millions more – a significant proportion of which are domestically produced vaccine candidates in trial stage. Chen told the media he hopes that once they have enough supply, they will be able to administer 1m doses per week, through Taiwan’s 300 hospitals, 800 clinics and 200 other locations. According to local media he said any businesses with more than 1,000 employees can host a vaccination stop. Chen said the government hopes to have 60% of the population receive at least one dose by October. It’s potentially a tall order, requiring about 14m doses. Currently Taiwan has received 850,000 doses, a mix of AstraZeneca and Moderna. It has ordered about 4.5m more from Moderna, 9.2m from Astrazeneca, and 4.7m via Covax, but the imminent arrival of any of these is far from confirmed given the aforementioned complications and global shortages. Another 10m have been ordered via two Taiwan producers, but these vaccines are still in trial stage. Producers have said they intend to apply for emergency use this month – international approval likely a long way after that. In the UK, Labour’s opposition spokesperson on education, Kate Green, has called for more support for extra-curricular activities in schools as part of the Covid catch-up package being proposed by the government. She told BBC Breakfast: “What we’re proposing is that there should be a range of measures in a package of support for children and young people. “Yes more time for small group tutoring and catching up on lost learning, but children can’t learn well if they’re worried, if they’re anxious, if they’re not having time to play and develop. “So we’re also suggesting support for extra-curricular activities, play, drama, art and so on, and of course in putting in mental health support in schools.” PA Media reports she added: “Children need some time to relax and enjoy life, over the summer and into the new school year we think the important thing is to make sure the fabulous facilities that schools have, the sports fields, the art rooms, the music rooms and so on, can be used for out-of-school activities too. “So we’re talking about school being open for longer but not for lots of extra formal learning, we don’t want children doing maths at five and six in the evening when they’re really tired.” Somewhere, someone in the UK government wrote “education” on their media grid for today, and so education minister Gavin Williamson has been sent out on the airwaves with details of plans to help pupils in the UK catch-up with schooling they may have missed during the pandemic. He has endured quite a torrid time in a somewhat bad-tempered appearance on Sky News, where at one point he was told that the presenter hates doing shouty, repetitive interviews, but that the minister just wasn’t answering the questions. In particular, he was pressed over the discrepancy between the money offered – £1.4bn – and the amount that catch-up tsar Sir Kevan Collins has said is needed to increase education opportunities – £15bn. PA Media quotes Williams as saying: “It is a lot of money and it builds on £1.7bn that we’ve already committed in terms of actually delivering for children – it is an extra 100m hours of tutoring. “It is making sure that children who need that help, who need that support, that we’re delivering that tutoring revolution to help them get it. “But we recognise it is part of a process. Over the past 12 months, we have already announced a previous £1.7bn worth of additional funding and we are looking at a whole raft of additional ideas for how we can continue to support our children, making sure none of them are left behind. “We have been working very closely with Sir Kevan Collins and actually the interventions around tutoring, driving up teaching quality, these are very much built on the work we’ve been doing together, recognising how incredibly important it is that we take on these interventions in order to help children.” There’s more detail on the government plans here from my colleagues Peter Walker and Rachel Hall, who write that: Pupils will be offered an extra 100m hours of tuition under post-pandemic catch-up plans unveiled today – but the government faced immediate criticism of the £1.4bn programme, with its own tsar warning “more will be needed”. After months of unprecedented school closures, £1.4bn will be spent on up to 6m sets of 15-hour tutoring courses for disadvantaged pupils as well as an expansion of an existing fund for helping 16- to 19-year-olds with subjects such as English and maths, the Department for Education (DfE) said. There is also provision for extra training and support for teachers, and funding to allow some year-13 students to repeat their final year if it was badly affected by the pandemic. It gave no immediate verdict on mooted plans to extend schools days by 30 minutes. This idea, criticised as misplaced by some teaching unions, will be the subject of a separate review due to report later in the year. Today’s WorldView email from the Washington Post by Ishaan Tharoor makes for quite bleak reading. He writes that while in the US, life is returning to normal, the pandemic is getting worse, even when it seems like it’s getting better: The pandemic is hardly in retreat elsewhere. The emergence of more virulent variants and the slowness of vaccination efforts in many places outside the West have contributed to deadly new waves. Coronavirus case counts worldwide are already higher in 2021 than they were in 2020. Southeast Asia, once a bastion of resistance to the virus, is in the grip of a harrowing spike in infections. Cases in Thailand and Vietnam rose dramatically over the past month. Malaysia is now registering more new infections per million people than any medium- or large-size country in Asia, surpassing India. In Africa, concerns are growing over the possible arrival of a new wave powered by a more transmissible variant of the virus, with the health systems in many countries at risk of being quickly subsumed by a surge of infections. A recent study found that the continent has the world’s highest death rate of patients critically ill with covid-19, thanks to limited intensive care facilities and reserves of vital medical supplies like oxygen. In parts of Latin America, the virus rages on, largely unabated. Peru, according to its own government-adjusted data, now has the worst covid-19 mortality rate per capita in the world. Even in East Asia, where a handful of nations set the gold standard in preventing community spread, the virus is on the march. Taiwan has seen an explosion of cases over the past month. In Japan, which still intends to host the Summer Olympics, numerous areas including Tokyo remain under a state of emergency. Read more here: Washington Post – The pandemic is getting worse, even when it seems like it’s getting better Neil Lancefield, PA Media’s transport correspondent, has some quotes from Tom Bartosak-Harlow from the Confederation of Passenger Transport (CPT) this morning. He’s worried that if face coverings and social distancing requirements continue on public transport in England after they have been dropped in other settings, it will stigmatise the use of buses and trains. He said: We need to see public transport moving at the same pace as the rest of the country. If you no longer have to wear a face covering in certain situations such as hospitality and retail but you do on public transport, we think that would undermine confidence in public transport. If people have this view that going on a bus or a coach carries a greater risk of catching Covid, in the longer term that will encourage people to use their car. Good morning, it is Martin Belam here taking over in London, where this morning the mayor Sadiq Khan has been warning fans of Scottish football not to travel if they don’t have tickets when England and Scotland face each other at Wembley on 18 June. Khan joins the Scottish government and Scottish Football Association (SFA) to ask fans not to travel to the city unless they have a ticket, or a safe place to watch the match. He said: “I am so excited for Euro 2020 and one of the games that I am looking forward to the most is England’s match with Scotland at Wembley. “I have some amazing memories of England v Scotland games in the past and I love the atmosphere that Scottish fans always bring to major football tournaments. “However, I am today urging all fans to only come to London if you have a ticket for the match or if you have arranged a safe place to watch it from, in compliance with Covid-19 guidelines.” He added: “I want to be completely clear that Scottish fans will not be able to access their traditional Trafalgar Square base, as it will be used as a socially-distanced fan zone for key workers who are helping our city through the pandemic. “Due to Covid regulations there are no alternative sites for fans to gather in large numbers in central London.” Here’s how UK media reported the great news on Tuesday of zero Covid-related deaths in the country for the first day since the pandemic began. Many papers suggest that the first day without a single Covid death for 10 months means the complete easing of lockdown restrictions will go ahead in England as planned on 21 June. Mexico has revised its death count, adding 4,272 fatalities. The clinical review of past deaths, by a team of doctors and nurses, is largely a record-keeping exercise, AP reports. Mexico’s government has long acknowledged that the true death toll from the pandemic is far higher than the current total of 227,840, due to low testing capabilities. Many Mexicans have died at home, or never been tested. As well as the medical team-led reviews, another process also provides adjusted figures. The computerised search of death certificates for Covid-related symptoms has suggested more than 350,000 have died, which would give Mexico one of the highest per-capita fatality rates in the world. Reuters: A shipment of coronavirus vaccines to North Korea via the global Covax sharing programme that was expected for late May has been delayed again amid protracted consultations, South Korea’s unification ministry said on Tuesday. Covax, which secures vaccines for poor countries, has said it will provide nearly 2 million doses of AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine to North Korea. “Countries that want Covax support are required to hold various consultations and submit some documents including an inoculation plan,” a ministry official said. “But in North Korea’s case, such consultations have been prolonged and it appears that the shipment will be made later than initially planned.” Insular and secretive North Korea has not commented on any consultations on vaccines. It has not officially confirmed any Covid-19 infections, although Seoul officials have said an outbreak there cannot be ruled out as the North had trade and people-to-people exchanges with China before closing its border early last year. The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) alliance, which co-leads Covax with the World Health Organization (WHO), said work is ongoing and discussions continue with North Korea, but no shipment date was finalised. GAVI said last month that shipments have not been made to North Korea due to its lack of “technical preparedness” and global supply shortages but could be expected later this year. In a statement last week to the ongoing WHO annual assembly, North Korea accused unspecified countries of dominating vaccine supplies and causing a global “bottleneck” due to “national egoism.” “Some countries are procuring and storing the vaccines more than their needs ... when other countries can’t even procure it,” it said. In the last few hours a few countries have reported updated daily case numbers. India has reported 132,788 new cases over the past 24 hours, and an additional 3,207 deaths. Health ministry data says the country’s infection tally is about 28.3 million, with more than 335,000 deaths. In Germany, the Robert Koch Institute has said 4,917 new cases has brought the country’s total to 3,687,828, and an additional 179 fatalities has raised the death toll to 88,774. China has reported 24 new cases, including 10 domestic cases all in Guangdong province where authorities have imposed localised lockdown measures to control an outbreak. It also reported seven asymptomatic cases in Guangdong, which are counted separately. Via AFP: The World Health Organization has approved the Sinovac Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use – the second Chinese vaccine to receive the WHO’s green light. The UN health agency signed off on CoronaVac, a two-dose vaccine developed by the Beijing-based firm which is already being deployed in several countries around the world. The WHO said the emergency use listing (EUL) gives countries, funders, procuring agencies and communities assurance that the vaccine has met international standards. Last month Sinopharm became the first Chinese vaccine to be approved by the WHO. The organisation has also given EUL status to vaccines being made by Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and the AstraZeneca jab being produced in India, South Korea and the EU, which it counts separately. WHO’s listing paves the way for countries worldwide to approve and import a vaccine for distribution quickly, especially those states without an international-standard regulator of their own. It also opens the door for the jabs to enter the Covax global vaccine-sharing facility, which aims to provide equitable access to doses around the world, particularly in poorer countries. Currently only AstraZeneca and some Pfizer jabs are flowing through the scheme. Read more here: Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s continuing rolling coverage of the pandemic. You can catch up on the previous live blog here, or see below for a quick roundup of the past 24 hours. The Australian state of Victoria has extended its lockdown for another seven days as it works to control an outbreak in Melbourne. The UK has enjoyed a day without a single reported Covid death for the first time since the pandemic began. India said it is aiming to triple capacity to 10 million jabs per day by July to avert another wave of Covid-19 infections as deadly as the outbreak suffered since April. A Brazilian Supreme Court judge has given president Jair Bolsonaro five days to submit information regarding the government’s decision to host the Copa America football tournament despite the nation’s ongoing struggles with Covid-19. A decrease in local Covid-19 vaccine production has slowed the pace of Brazil’s inoculation drive and contributed to a growing number of people not taking their second doses, according to the latest data from the Fiocruz biomedical institute. Heathrow airport in London has begun processing arrivals from red list countries in a dedicated terminal following concerns about them mixing with other passengers. Travellers arriving from red list nations on direct flights are being taken to Terminal 3. Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa called on faster delivery of vaccines to poorer countries, including by waiving patents on vaccine development. Peru has revised its official Covid-19 death toll to 180,764, nearly triple the previous official figure of 69,342, following a government review that shows the severity of the outbreak in the country. The World Health Organisation has recommended a new set of names for the coronavirus “variants of concern”, which will be known by letters of the Greek alphabet. Alpha is the new name for UK/Kent (B.1.1.7), Beta for South Africa (B.1.351), Gamma for Brazil (P.1) and Delta for the variant first detected in India (B.1.617.2). Malaysia has begun a tough nationwide lockdown to battle a worsening coronavirus outbreak. Of almost 2,800 deaths from Covid-19 recorded in the country of 32 million since the start of the pandemic, over 40 percent were in May alone. Israel announced it will begin phasing out coronavirus-related payments to the unemployed and Ireland announced similar steps later this year while maintaining other income and business supports as the economy fully reopens. The Coachella music festival will return to the US in April 2022 after being repeatedly delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic, organisers have announced.","charCount":"34543","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a> (now) and <a href=\"profile/helen-davidson\">Helen Davidson</a> (earlier)"},{"headline":"Stressed-out Amazon workers can now access ‘mindfulness’ training.

The highest number of deaths to occur on a single day was 1,477 on January 19, PA news reports. During the first wave of the virus, the daily death toll peaked at 1,461 deaths on April 8 2020. Hundreds of workers at the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency have launched fresh industrial action in a long-running dispute over Covid-related safety. Members of the Public and Commercial Services union at the DVLA site in Swansea went on strike on Wednesday until Saturday, PA Media reports. The union warned it was entering a new phase of “sustained and targeted” industrial unrest for months to come. The latest strike is the third time staff have walked out over demands for more safety measures. The DVLA insists it has done everything possible to keep workers safe and has followed official guidelines. The PCS general secretary, Mark Serwotka, said a deal was all but agreed to end the dispute, claiming it was suddenly withdrawn at the 11th hour without any explanation. He said: Through painstaking negotiation, our union and DVLA senior management were on the verge of agreeing a deal only for it to be scuppered at the last minute. We strongly suspect senior ministers at the Department for Transport have interfered with the progress we were making and want to make some kind of ideological stand against PCS. They have grossly underestimated the resolve of our members in DVLA and have only emboldened them to take targeted and sustained action in the months ahead until they win. PCS is fully prepared for months of strike action, and we urge the government to rethink its position. A DVLA spokesman said: It’s disappointing to see the Public and Commercial Services union not only choose to continue with industrial action when there are zero Covid cases at DVLA, but they are also specifically targeting areas of the organisation that will have the greatest negative impact on the public, including some of the more vulnerable people in society, just as restrictions are starting to ease. The DVLA has worked closely with Public Health Wales along with Swansea environmental health and the Health and Safety Executive who have conducted regular site visits and inspections and have repeatedly confirmed a high level of compliance with control measures. Millions of people right across the UK are relying on essential DVLA services and PCS’s demands will cause significant and unnecessary disruption to families and businesses, all at a time when they are most needed. During a series of interviews on Wednesday, Gavin Williamson struggled to explain the discrepancy between the announced government spending and that recommended by the education recovery commissioner, Sir Kevan Collins, who was appointed in February by Downing Street to lead efforts to make up for the damage done by the coronavirus pandemic, particularly to pupils from more deprived backgrounds. The education secretary was asked multiple times on Sky News about either the difference in the two sums or about the discussions with the Treasury about funding, and he declined to give a direct answer. The proportion of deaths involving coronavirus in England and Wales is at its lowest level for more than eight months, figures show. There were 9,860 deaths from all causes registered in the week ending 21 May, according to the Office for National Statistics. Of these, 1.1% (107 deaths) had “novel coronavirus” mentioned on the death certificate, PA news reports. The last time the proportion was so low was in the week ending 11 September, when the virus accounted for 1% of deaths. At the peak of the second wave, in the week ending 29 January, Covid-19 accounted for 45.7% of registered deaths. The latest figure is the lowest number of deaths involving coronavirus since the week ending 11 September, and a fall of 29% from the previous week. The prospect of care home workers being required to get vaccinated against Covid-19 has moved a step closer, with a crucial endorsement from the UK’s human rights watchdog. Ministers are considering changing the law to make vaccination a condition of deployment for people in some professions that come into regular close contact with elderly and vulnerable people at high risk from the coronavirus. In a report to the government seen by the Guardian, the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) said making vaccines compulsory for care home staff would be a “significant departure from current public health policy”. But it judged that ministers were “right to prioritise protection of the right to life for residents and staff” and said it would be reasonable for care home workers to need a jab “in order to work directly with older and disabled people, subject to some important safeguards”. The EHRC is also likely to make a similar recommendation about healthcare workers, after the vaccines minister, Nadhim Zahawi, suggested over the weekend that NHS staff could face mandatory jabs, too, as some patients were “being infected in hospital”. Zahawi said no decisions had been made yet, and stressed there was a precedent: surgeons were required to be vaccinated against hepatitis B. He added: It would be incumbent on any responsible government to have the debate, to do the thinking about how we go about protecting the most vulnerable by making sure that those who look after them are vaccinated. A government source said: “We think it would save lives.” Read the full story here: The shadow education secretary, Kate Green, has called for more support for extra-curricular activities in schools. Green told BBC Breakfast: What we’re proposing is that there should be a range of measures in a package of support for children and young people. Yes more time for small group tutoring and catching up on lost learning, but children can’t learn well if they’re worried, if they’re anxious, if they’re not having time to play and develop. So we’re also suggesting support for extra-curricular activities, play, drama, art and so on, and of course in putting in mental health support in schools. She added: Children need some time to relax and enjoy life, over the summer and into the new school year we think the important thing is to make sure the fabulous facilities that schools have, the sports fields, the art rooms, the music rooms and so on, can be used for out-of-school activities too. So we’re talking about school being open for longer but not for lots of extra formal learning, we don’t want children doing maths at five and six in the evening when they’re really tired. Pupils will be offered an extra 100m hours of tuition under post-pandemic catch-up plans unveiled today – but the government faced immediate criticism of the £1.4bn programme, with its own tsar warning “more will be needed”. After months of unprecedented school closures, £1.4bn will be spent on up to 6m sets of 15-hour tutoring courses for disadvantaged pupils as well as an expansion of an existing fund for helping 16- to 19-year-olds with subjects such as English and maths, the Department for Education said. There is also provision for extra training and support for teachers, and funding to allow some year 13 students to repeat their final year if it was badly affected by the pandemic. It gave no immediate verdict on mooted plans to extend school days by 30 minutes. This idea, criticised as misplaced by some teaching unions, will be the subject of a separate review due to report later in the year. On the new spending plans there was virtual unanimity from unions that the sums committed were insufficient, with the National Education Union calling them “inadequate and incomplete”. Perhaps even more damaging for ministers, the announced spend is about a 10th of the £15bn total understood to have been recommended by Sir Kevan Collins, who was appointed in February by Downing Street as the education recovery commissioner tasked with leading efforts to make up for the damage done by the coronavirus pandemic, particularly to pupils from more deprived backgrounds. Read the full story by my colleagues Peter Walker and Rachel Hall here: The £1.4bn announced for the catch-up programme for pupils in England is “pitiful”, a school leaders’ union has said. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), told Sky News: It’s pretty dispiriting, here I am as somebody who is leading a trade union, and for all my colleagues it feels this morning as if we have got higher ambitions for the nation’s children and young people than the education secretary. It’s pretty pitiful, only yesterday we were hearing stories about extending the school day and even if some people disagreed with it, at least there was a sense of ‘let’s do something radical, let’s do something different’. Today’s announcement essentially equates to 50 per head, you compare that with the USA which is putting 1,600 per head, per young person, or the Netherlands, 2,500 per head. So what is it about those children in the Netherlands or the USA that makes them worth more than our government seems to say? It’s time to stop the rhetoric I think and start the action on behalf of children and young people. A total of 107 deaths registered in England and Wales in the week ending 21 May mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate, according to the Office for National Statistics – the lowest number since the week ending September 11 2020. The figure is down 29% on the previous week. Around one in 91 (1.1%) deaths registered in the week to 21 May mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate. Education secretary Gavin Williamson said recording zero deaths from coronavirus on Tuesday was “promising” but urged the public not to be complacent. Speaking to LBC radio, he said: “It shows that the enormous sacrifices of the British people are starting to really deliver.” He said: The fact that the British people have gone out there with verve and gusto and actually got vaccinated when so many other nations have not had that same level of take-up is a real credit. It is promising what we’ve seen in terms of zero deaths but we can’t be complacent. We continue to be careful and we’ve got to make sure we continue to get vaccinated. Williamson added there was a sense in government that there had been “really promising progress” towards scrapping all restrictions on 21 June, adding: You’re right to say it is about data, not dates, but the vaccines are having an impact in terms of actually reducing transmission, reducing the number of people in hospital and it is these factors that are going to guide the decision. Cabinet minister Gavin Williamson suggested more money will be “required” as the government tackles lost pupil learning during the pandemic. Put to him that an extra £1.4bn amounted to £50 per pupil in England, the education secretary told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: It is quite unprecedented to be getting this quantum of money outside of a spending review. But what we decided we needed to do was deliver interventions and support and invest in children immediately – that’s why we’ve ... over the last few months announced a total of over £3bn in terms of targeted help for children. Asked whether the Department for Education had not announced longer learning hours – with catch-up tsar Sir Kevan Collins reportedly pushing for an additional 100 hours per pupil – due to a lack of extra funding, Williamson said: “I have no doubt that in order to deliver everything we have ambitions for, for our children, there will be more that is required.” The education secretary said he was “absolutely delighted with £1.4bn”, when asked whether he had wanted more financial investment from the Treasury for the coronavirus catch-up plans. Pressed further on LBC radio on whether he had requested an additional “£5-6bn”, Williamson said: It is incredibly tempting to get involved in divulging to you private conversations with the chancellor and the prime minister, but I’m going to possibly sidestep this one, if that’s OK?

They come over for two or three Tests, are unintentionally patronised whenever they win or lose, and then leave before the main event. This year, they are more like the complimentary bar snack you receive when your table is late. Their two-Test series against England isn’t even on the menu, also known in some cultures as <a href=\"https://www.icc-cricket.com/media-releases/742353\">the Future Tours Programme</a>; nor is it part of the next World Test Championship. And though this is 3rd v 2nd in the Test rankings, it is seen by most as a glorified warm-up for more important matches against the No1 side, India. New Zealand play them in the World Test Championship final later this month; England’s five-Test series kicks off in August.</p> <p>Test cricket may not yet have a second division, but it has multiple tiers. For a variety of reasons – the schedule, the FTP, the WTC, the IPL, the OCG – some games are bigger than others. England’s five Test series in 2021 could probably be split into three levels.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Tier 1</strong> Australia (A)</li> <li><strong>Tier 2</strong> India (A), India (H)</li> <li><strong>Tier 3</strong> Sri Lanka (A), New Zealand (H)</li> </ul> <p>There is a lot of sincere admiration for world cricket’s great overachievers (see, I’ve done it! I’ve patronised them without realising!) within English cricket. But there’s also a subconscious voice that will forever say, ‘<a href=\"https://talksport.com/football/415659/former-manchester-united-manager-sir-alex-fergusons-pre-match-team-talk-for-spurs-at-old-trafford-lads-its-tottenham/\">Lads, it’s New Zealand</a>’. On the face of it, this is another example of England telling New Zealand how great they are while simultaneously belitting them. But as Grady Tripp would say, it’s a little more <em>com</em>plicated than that. New Zealand will be back next summer for a more ostensibly meaningful series, albeit still as the warm-up act. These two Tests, added to the schedule at the last minute, are essentially a goodwill gesture to broadcasters.</p> <p>Money is the main motivation, there’s no point saying otherwise, but there is a bit more to it than that. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/may/26/england-second-test-against-new-zealand-to-have-18000-fans-edgbaston-cricket\">With the return of crowds at Lord’s and Edgbaston</a>, this series feels like a modern take on <a href=\"https://wisden.com/stories/how-the-1945-victory-tests-rekindled-crickets-competitive-spark\">the Victory Tests of 1945</a>. Let’s hope somebody catches the mood and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2004/oct/12/cricket\">plays like Keith Miller did then</a>. </p> <p>There are a few contenders, from Joe Root to the exciting debutant Devon Conway (<a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/player/devon-conway-379140\">check out these numbers</a>). For all the talk of England’s rotation, the standard of the cricket, especially the fast bowling, will be high. And this is not, as some have suggested, as England A team. They are missing only Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler and Jofra Archer from their best XI, if such a thing exists anymore, and Stokes and Archer are injured anyway. </p> <p>New Zealand are without Trent Boult because of his post-IPL isolation, yet they still have a brainy, brawny seam attack* of Tim Southee, Neil Wagner and the fascinating Kyle Jamieson. As bar snacks go, this is definitely more Hawksmoor than Jefferson Davis Wetherspoons.</p> <p><em>* Is that patronising as well?

He starts round the wicket to Latham, the angle that has brought him so much success against David Warner in particular. When he strays onto the pads, Latham puts him away behind square for a couple. A single off the last ball means the debutant Conway will have to wait a little longer to face his first ball in Test cricket. “Tremendous to hear that England are planning seven straight wins before the Ashes,” says Pete Salmon. “Is anyone running a book on when that will be put to one side. I’m going with tea on day two tomorrow. Prove me wrong Engurland!” 1st over: New Zealand 1-0 (Latham 1, Conway 0) James Anderson, the man with 614 Test wickets, takes the first over.

New Zealand Latham, Conway, Williamson (c), Taylor, Nicholls, Watling (wk), de Grandhomme, Santner, Jamieson, Southee, Wagner. Joe Root says England would have batted as well, though he doesn’t seem too disappointed - there’s a decent amount of grass on the pitch so England have the chance to do some damage this morning. Kane Williamson says it looks a good pitch. They are playing a spinner, Mitch Santner, so bowling last in these conditions could be a decent advantage. There are plenty of interesting subplots in this game. Two, in particular, stand out. The six England batsmen not called Joe Root are battling for four places against India, and New Zealand want to improve their away record. Just playing away from home helps - this is only their third series since 2016. James Bracey and Ollie Robinson will make their Test debuts. It looks like England have omitted Jack Leach, which is a bit of a gamble given the glorious weather in north London. I’m really excited to see Robinson in particular. His record since the start of the 2018 season is outrageous: 195 wickets at 17.29. And he can bat. New Zealand are usually the hors d’oeuvre of the English summer. They come over for two or three Tests, are unintentionally patronised whenever they win or lose, and then leave before the main event. This year, they are more like the complimentary bar snack you receive when your table is late. Their two-Test series against England isn’t even on the menu, also known in some cultures as the Future Tours Programme; nor is it part of the next World Test Championship. And though this is 3rd v 2nd in the Test rankings, it is seen by most as a glorified warm-up for more important matches against the No1 side, India. New Zealand play them in the World Test Championship final later this month; England’s five-Test series kicks off in August. Test cricket may not yet have a second division, but it has multiple tiers. For a variety of reasons – the schedule, the FTP, the WTC, the IPL, the OCG – some games are bigger than others. England’s five Test series in 2021 could probably be split into three levels. Tier 1 Australia (A) Tier 2 India (A), India (H) Tier 3 Sri Lanka (A), New Zealand (H) There is a lot of sincere admiration for world cricket’s great overachievers (see, I’ve done it! I’ve patronised them without realising!) within English cricket. But there’s also a subconscious voice that will forever say, ‘Lads, it’s New Zealand’. On the face of it, this is another example of England telling New Zealand how great they are while simultaneously belitting them. But as Grady Tripp would say, it’s a little more complicated than that. New Zealand will be back next summer for a more ostensibly meaningful series, albeit still as the warm-up act. These two Tests, added to the schedule at the last minute, are essentially a goodwill gesture to broadcasters. Money is the main motivation, there’s no point saying otherwise, but there is a bit more to it than that. With the return of crowds at Lord’s and Edgbaston, this series feels like a modern take on the Victory Tests of 1945. Let’s hope somebody catches the mood and plays like Keith Miller did then. There are a few contenders, from Joe Root to the exciting debutant Devon Conway (check out these numbers). For all the talk of England’s rotation, the standard of the cricket, especially the fast bowling, will be high. And this is not, as some have suggested, as England A team. They are missing only Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler and Jofra Archer from their best XI, if such a thing exists anymore, and Stokes and Archer are injured anyway. New Zealand are without Trent Boult because of his post-IPL isolation, yet they still have a brainy, brawny seam attack* of Tim Southee, Neil Wagner and the fascinating Kyle Jamieson. As bar snacks go, this is definitely more Hawksmoor than Jefferson Davis Wetherspoons. * Is that patronising as well?

The company said people had “rediscovered the joy of reading” during the coronavirus pandemic, pushing its sales 14% higher to £185m in the 12 months to the end of February. Bloomsbury performed significantly better than the wider UK publishing market, which recorded a 2% rise in sales during 2020, according to data from the Publishers Association. The company said fantasy, escapism, social inclusion and cookery all sold well during the pandemic. New bestsellers included two books by the American fantasy author Sarah J Maas about female warriors, including A Court of Silver Flames, as well as the fantasy novel Piranesi by the British author Susanna Clarke. Other bestsellers included Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People About Race by Reni Eddo-Lodge, and Humankind by Rutger Bregman. The Harry Potter books by JK Rowling continue to attract new readers, almost a quarter of a century after their first publication. Bloomsbury said sales of the series about the boy wizard rose 7% during the past year. Here’s the full story: Here’s trade expert David Henig of the European Centre For International Political Economy on CPTPP: The Institute for Government have a very useful guide to the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership on their website, which was updated in February after the UK applied to join. It explains that membership shouldn’t significantly clash with the UK’s Brexit trade deal (as many CPTPP members already have their own agreements with the EU). But is also warned that the benefits of membership are unlikely in any significant way to make up for the economic losses of Brexit. That’s partly because the UK has already rolled over its free trade agreements (FTAs) with some members. It signed a free trade deal with Japan last year, and will probably have signed bilateral deals with Australia and New Zealand well before joining CPTPP. [On Australia, some UK farmers fear a zero-tariff and zero-quota trade deal would drive them out of business, if it leads to a surge of Australian beef imports]. Plus, there’s concern that negotiators may agree to controversial secret courts where businesses could seek compensation if their profits are hit by government policies] So, the Institute for Government argued, the benefits of the UK joining CPTPP could be limited to: FTAs with Malaysia and Brunei more ambitious text than is found in some of the rolled-over FTAs on issues such as digital services and data flows the ability to operate under a single set of rules of origin. It added: While these benefits are not negligible, they are unlikely in any significant way to make up for the economic losses arising from the UK leaving the EU. The single set of rules of origin would mean that a product could contain parts from any CPTPP country and still qualify for preferential treatment. EG, cars made in the UK could use more Pacific nation car parts, such as Japanese batteries. If a good has to have at least 70% ‘CPTPP content’ to qualify for preferential tariffs, for instance, that 70% can come from any combination of CPTPP countries. The Institute for Government explainer also outlines how the rights and obligations under the CPTPP fall into two categories: Rules: for example, on how countries should make new food safety regulations or whether they can ban the transfer of data to other CPTPP members. These are the same for all CPTPP parties (including any new members that may join). Market access: how far each CPTPP member will cut its tariffs, open up its services markets, liberalise visa conditions for business travellers, and so on. Each member has its own schedules of commitments. In some cases the commitments are offered to all other members, while in others they are restricted to specific negotiating partners. And on tariffs, they added: The CPTPP provides for almost complete liberalisation of tariffs among the participants. Tariffs are retained in only a few highly sensitive areas – for example, Japan keeps tariffs on rice, while Canada’s dairy industry is also protected. The full explainer is here: Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) The trade benefits for the UK joining CPTPP will be ‘small’, warns Robert Ward of The International Institute for Strategic Studies. Instead, he thinks the important point is CPTPP’s statement that UK membership would send “a strong signal” to other countries of the importance of free, fair, open, effective, inclusive and rules-based trade (see opening post). Trade tensions have been heightened in recent years, particularly with the bitter US-China trade war. Relations between Canberra and Beijing have also deteriorated, with China imposing tariffs and restricting imports of Australian products such as barley, wine and beef in a deepening row over alleged dumping. New Zealand’s trade and export growth minister, Damien O’Connor, says an Accession Working Group will be set up to begin the accession process with the UK. This group will examine how the UK will comply with the existing CPTPP rules and will negotiate the UK’s market access commitments. Under CPTPP accession procedures, candidates are expected to deliver the highest standard of market access commitments, including on goods, services and temporary entry for business people, O’Connor explains in a statement welcoming the move. “We look forward to working with our CPTPP partners and the UK to establish how the UK will meet the high standards required in the CPTPP, including those relating to market access. “It will be particularly important that this first accession process sets a strong precedent, both in regard to the substantive commitments expected of the UK, as well as in the adoption of a thorough and robust process.” The UK government have welcomed the invitation to begin negotiations to join CPTPP. International Trade Secretary Liz Truss said: CPTTP membership is a huge opportunity for Britain. It will help shift our economic centre of gravity away from Europe towards faster-growing parts of the world, and deepen our access to massive consumer markets in the Asia Pacific. We would get all the benefits of joining a high standards free trade area, but without having to cede control of our borders, money or laws. The Department for International Trade adds that CPTPP countries made up £110bn of UK trade in 2019 and its rules remove tariffs on 95% of goods traded between members. But as this map shows, its Pacific Rim members are rather a long way from the UK, rather than the geographical proximity of the EU.... Secretary of State for International Trade Liz Truss says it’s “excellent news” that negotiations to join CPTPP can begin. The government will present its plans to Parliament “in the coming weeks” before negotiations start, she adds. Australia’s trade minister Dan Tehan has tweeted a picture of today’s virtual meeting where the CPTPP agreed to start accession talks with the UK. He adds that “the economic and strategic heft” of the partnership would be strengthened by “high quality, high ambition economies” joining. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The UK has moved a step closer to joining a major Pacific regional trade bloc as it tries to forge closer trade links with the Asia-Pacific region after its exit from the European Union. Earlier today, the 11 members of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, or CPTPP, agreed to start negotiations for Britain’s entry into the regional free trade agreement. Yasutoshi Nishimura, Japan’s minister in charge of TPP negotiations, told reporters that a virtual meeting of the TPP Commission agreed to allow the U.K. to begin the process to join. Bloomberg calls it a “potential boost for the country’s trade following Brexit”, adding: Yasutoshi Nishimura said the move would strengthen economic ties between the U.K. and Japan, as well as making the zone covered by the deal equal to the EU in terms of economic size. He spoke to reporters after hosting an online meeting of ministers and officials from the 11 countries who make up the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership. “The commencement of an accession process with the United Kingdom and the potential expansion of the CPTPP will send a strong signal to our trading partners around the world of our commitment to support a free, fair, open, effective, inclusive and rules-based trading system,” the ministers said in a joint statement. CPTPP consists of Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam -- and was created after president Donald Trump withdrew the US from the Trans-Pacific partnership. Britain filed a request to join CPTPP at the start of February, saying it hoped to build deeper ties with emerging economies in the Pacific. At the time, International Trade Secretary Liz Truss said membership would mean lower tariffs for car manufacturers and whisky producers, and better access for services providers, boosting employment and prosperity. As the UK’s trade in goods with EU countries fell by 23 per cent in the first quarter of the year, compared with pre-pandemic levels, there is pressure to strike trade deals elsewhere. The CPTPP removes 95% of tariffs between its members, but does not create a single market or a customs union, and it does not seek wider political integration. Becoming a member would accelerate the U.K.’s growth in export trade with faster-expanding Asian economies, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Mike Dennis. The U.K. recorded a trade surplus with CPTPP countries in the first quarter of 2021, he added. But while joining CPTPP would mean lower tariffs, concerns have been raised about the move. Back in April, the UK Labour party warned that it could end up being a trade deal with China “by the back door”, as Beijing has signalled that it is seriously considering an application, which the UK might not be able to veto if it joined. Shadow international trade secretary Emily Thornberry also warned that the UK could end up “as a rule-taker in the CPTPP rather than a rule-maker,” as New Zealand recently launched a public consultation on new accessions to the CPTPP, which said that new members will need to comply with the existing agreement. More here: Liz Truss urged to reconsider trans-Pacific free trade pact The moves comes as the global economy tries to recover from the shock of the pandemic, with world manufacturing growth hitting an 11-year high last month. That lifted recovery hopes, lifting world and European stock markets to record highs yesterday. The UK’s FTSE 100 reached a three-week high, led by commodity stocks.

The Melbourne-based Magpies have been granted a special exemption to travel to South Australia for Saturday’s twilight clash with the Crows at Adelaide Oval, which has been operating with full-capacity crowds since early May. South Australia’s chief public health officer, Prof Nicola Spurrier, on Wednesday defended the decision to allow the team to visit despite the border being closed to Victoria amid the state’s growing Covid-19 cluster. Spurrier described the exemption as a “special situation”, saying the risk was “negligible” because the team was already in quarantine at home in Melbourne along with their families or housemates. Only essential staff and players will fly into South Australia on game day, travel to Adelaide Oval on a health department bus and fly out straight after the match. “They will not be making contact with anyone in SA except the players in the Crows team,” Spurrier said. “That is the only group in SA that will be exposed.” But Spurrier went on to surprise media at her press conference by revealing that discussions with stadium staff included not only a bid to reduce contact opportunities between fans and players – but also between fans and the ball. “We’re looking at the seating at the moment and, of course, we’re looking at the ball,” she said. “Because sometimes the ball, not that I’ve been to many football games, but I have noticed occasionally it does get kicked into the crowd.

As part of the extension of the lockdown in Melbourne, the acting premier, James Merlino, announced on Wednesday that supermarkets and retailers would be required to make everyone check in when they entered into the store. Previously it was only a recommendation. After the state recorded a number of Covid-19 transmissions at retail stores where the contacts had “fleeting” contact, Victoria’s chief health officer, Prof Brett Sutton, said the change was to ensure records of everyone at potential exposure sites were complete. “We are in a position now where the Victorian community is motivated to do the right thing and they understand the importance of contact tracing in this space,” he said. “And even though we have been doing really well in identifying people at all exposure sites, I think everyone recognises that we have to do absolutely everything in our power to be able to chase down every single person who may be exposed because it is that one person who is not found who may be the one who spreads it.” The Victorian government launched its Covid QR-code check-in app, Service Victoria, at the end of November 2020 but continued to allow hospitality venues to to use their own QR-code systems to record people visiting. However, since the end of March, third-party app providers have been required to use the government application programming interface, meaning all the check-in data across the state goes to the one government-held database when contact tracers need it, regardless of which app is used. The Service Victoria app then became mandatory for all businesses to use from Friday 28 May – coincidentally the first day Victoria entered a one-week lockdown due to a Covid-19 outbreak. Data obtained by Guardian Australia reveals a significant increase in check-ins to the Service Victoria app in May as businesses began to transition to the single app. The state had 18m check-ins between 13 and 31 May, out of 39m in total since the app was launched at the end of November 2020. Victoria’s app still has recorded far fewer check-ins than its counterpart in New South Wales, where the Service NSW app has been mandatory since 1 January. NSW reported 50.6m for the month of May alone – a 2.3m increase on check-ins over April, which had 48.3m. But that latest figure is still significantly lower than the peak of 66m check-ins when the state made the Service NSW app mandatory in January. Queensland’s Check In Qld app has recorded 45m check-ins since it was launched on 28 February. The app became mandatory for hospitality venues at the start of May, and a spokesperson for the Queensland Department of Communities said there had been significant growth in the number of check-ins at venues, recording a 17% increase in the week to 28 May and a 20% increase the week before. The ACT, which has an estimated population of just over 460,000, has recorded close to 13m check-ins since the start of this year. For a broader comparison, Guardian Australia sought a breakdown of total check-ins from all apps into the Victorian government’s server since it became mandatory to feed into the one system, but the Department of Health only provided data from the Service Victoria app. There has been concern that enforcement of Covid-19 check-ins has not been as strong in Victoria as in other states where it is mandatory. Early last month contact tracers had to find dozens of people who dined at the same restaurant as the Wollert man who is at the centre of the current Covid-19 outbreak but did not check in. In a three-week blitz on Victorian businesses in April, authorised officers found 37% of the more than 4,000 businesses visited were non-compliant with QR-code check-in rules. There were 165 enforcement notices issued and 300 verbal warnings given for the range of Covid rules not being enforced. Police can fine individuals up to $1,652 and businesses $9,913 for failing to comply with Covid-19 rules in the public health directions. Victoria’s health minister, Martin Foley, said last week that QR codes gave contact tracers “the certainty they need” and people should check in at venues where they spent 15 minutes or longer. The QR-code check-in system has become the dominant method for contact tracers to find potential close contacts during outbreaks.

The Victorian acting premier, James Merlino, announced the extension of the lockdown on Wednesday. It came as the Victorian government put another proposal to the federal government to reinstate jobkeeper-style payments to Victorian workers for the duration of the lockdown – a proposal Merlino says the state will take to national cabinet if the federal treasurer, Victoria-based Josh Frydenberg, does not accede. Merlino announced a further $209m in support for Victorian businesses on top of $250m announced on Sunday. Melbourne businesses will be able to apply for grants of up to $5,000 – double the $2,500 offered for just one week of lockdown. “The [state] treasurer is calling, has been calling Josh Frydenberg this morning to put that request, and I will be speaking to the prime minister later today and I do hope that the commonwealth will swiftly confirm that they will step up and provide that support,” Merlino said. “If they do not, I will be raising this directly at national cabinet on Friday.” Frydenberg has signalled since Sunday he was monitoring the situation in Victoria. The Morrison government has been reluctant to step in because it is wary about providing incentives that encourage statewide lockdowns. But the federal government has not ruled out providing additional support configured on a national basis. Scott Morrison was due to speak with Merlino on Wednesday night and there was a separate conversation between Frydenberg and the Victorian treasurer, Tim Pallas, during the afternoon. Frydenberg told reporters in Canberra that he and Pallas had a “constructive” relationship despite his state counterpart’s criticism of him in recent days, “which we all have a sense of humour about”. Frydenberg said the jobkeeper payment had ended and the federal government would approach any additional support it “on a national basis”. “It is not about Victoria, or individual cases, it is about on a national basis, and we will stick to our principles – namely, our approaches will continue to be national, sustainable.” The seven-day lockdown was due to lift at midnight on Thursday but will instead be extended for people living in Melbourne until midnight on 10 June. In regional Victoria, the lockdown will lift this Thursday, with limits placed on gatherings and restaurant capacity and a new requirement for business owners to check the identification of patrons to make sure they have not travelled from Melbourne. “We have also seen previous examples of people who left Melbourne, broke the rules and took the virus with them,” the acting premier said. “We don’t want to see that happen again.” Merlino said authorities had “no choice” but to extend the lockdown in Melbourne. “If we let this thing run its course, it will explode. We’ve got to run this to ground because if we don’t, people will die.” The rules will be eased slightly to allow people to travel 10km for essential shopping or their daily two hours of exercise, to allow students in years 11 and 12 to return to school, and to allow some outdoor work activities – such as landscaping and installing solar panels – to operate. “At the end of another seven days, we do expect to be in a position to carefully ease restrictions in Melbourne, but there will continue to be differences between the settings in Melbourne compared to regional Victoria,” Merlino said. “So I want to be upfront with people that even if all goes well, we won’t be able to have people from Melbourne travelling to regional Victoria during the Queen’s birthday long weekend. The risk of exporting this virus is just too high.” Another resident at the Arcare Maidstone nursing home in Melbourne’s west has tested positive for Covid-19, the facility confirmed on Wednesday afternoon. In an email to the families of residents, the facility said the positive case would be transported to hospital. They are the second resident to test positive at the centre. Two workers also have Covid. “We are saddened to report that we have one additional client who has tested positive. This client will be transferred to hospital for public health reasons,” the Arcare chief executive, Colin Singh, said. The virus appears to have already spread to some regional areas. There have been detections of the virus in wastewater in Bendigo and on the Mornington Peninsula and exposure sites listed overnight on Tuesday include busy petrol stations on the Hume Freeway. Victoria’s chief health officer, Prof Brett Sutton, said 10% of the cases connected to the new outbreak had been the result of casual contacts, prompting health authorities to consider reclassifying tier two and three exposure sites to require people at those places to isolate. Sutton said he could not guarantee the lockdown would not be extended beyond next Thursday, and that it would depend on case numbers and also whether those new cases were in isolation or had caught the virus in a casual-contact setting. “We can’t have one or two cases out there and open back up to the kind of settings we had before,” he said. “That’s what led one case from South Australia to lead to 60 cases and thousands of primary close contacts within a month.” There were six new cases reported on Wednesday: a family of four from Victoria who tested positive after travelling to Jervis Bay in New South Wales; a close contact of the Stratton Finance case who had been in isolation for the whole infectious period; and a person who was dining at the Brighton Beach hotel, an outdoor dining venue, at the same time as a positive case. Health authorities are still trying to determine which of the Jervis Bay family first caught the virus, and where they caught it. Sutton said there was no clear crossover with any exposure sites. There are currently 5,200 people in Victoria in isolation as close contacts of known cases, of which 78% have returned a negative result. Meanwhile, South Australia’s chief public health officer defended the decision to allow Collingwood into the state for the weekend’s AFL clash against the Adelaide Crows. Prof Nicola Spurrier described the exemption as a “special situation” and said there was a “negligible risk” because the team was already quarantining at home and would have multiple tests as part of the process.","charCount":"6478","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/calla-wahlquist\">Calla Wahlquist</a>"}]

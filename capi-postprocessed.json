We have gone for a little bit of height, Timo and Kai have a good feeling for each other.

For your future reference, I think a much better and more idiomatic translation into Portuguese would be ‘Temos jogo!’ (We’ve got a game!).”</p> <p>Meanwhile your memories of the 1986 Full Members’ Cup final have been flooding in, in their twos. “I was there!” writes Matthew Holt. “Pat Nevin put in about four unplayable crosses for our goals, then in the last five mins City started scoring and were only stopped by the final whistle. A repeat today please, with the ghost of Wee Pat putting in a few for Werner to finish off!”</p> <p>Our resident Fife, Angus and Perth &amp; Kinross correspondent Simon McMahon adds: “Five Scots in the Chelsea team for that Full Members’ Cup Final, including of course Johnny Marr lookalike Pat Nevin, whose autobiography, The Accidental Footballer, is excellent by the way. Billy McNeill managing City too. Billy Gilmour, the only Scottish representative on the bench for Chelsea tonight, could have a Champions League winners medal at age 19. Doubt Nevin would swap his Full Members gong though.”</p> <p>Johnny Marr is a City fan, of course.

That’s a brave call, as he’ll have to field a fair few questions should this go wrong. Ilkay Gundogan is fit after limping out of training yesterday, Raheem Sterling starts, Oleksandr Zinchenko gets the nod at left-back, and if Sergio Aguero is to be the epochal hero again, he’ll need to come on and do it as a sub. Another 94th-minute winner, anyone? </p> <p><strong>Chelsea’s selection is comparatively understated. </strong>N’Golo Kante and Edouard Mendy are fit to play.

A shame in one respect, given the other-worldly Ataturk would have been a fitting venue for the denouement of an unearthly season … but a day on the Douro is one heck of a Plan B. Está ligado!</p> <p><strong>Manchester City are playing in their first European Cup final.</strong> It’s the end of a journey they began in 1968, when Malcolm Allison promised his and Joe Mercer’s English champions would set about Europe “as they have not been attacked since the days of the old Real Madrid … I think a lot of these European people are cowards.” Sure enough, having talked the big talk, they fell at the first hurdle against Fenerbahce. That brilliant Lee-Bell-Summerbee side brought home some European silverware in the end, winning the 1970 Cup Winners’ Cup, but that night <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2020/mar/21/chelsea-v-leeds-united-1970-fa-cup-final-replay-live\">everyone was watching the FA Cup final replay live in glorious technicolor on BBC1</a>, City’s 2-1 win over Gornik Zabrze relegated to late-night black-and-white highlights over on 2. Hapless happenstance always used to befall City back in the day.</p> <p><strong>Times change, though, and millions will be watching this evening as magisterial City finally look to make good on Allison’s words.</strong> City have scored 60 goals in their last 25 Champions League games. They’ve scored 25 in this campaign, letting in just four en route to the final. All this without a designated striker! They’re favourites tonight to win their second European bauble and their first European Cup.</p> <p><strong>Chelsea, playing in their third European Cup final, will have something to say about that.</strong> The Pensioners should have won the trophy in 2008, only for John Terry to freeze in the moment against Manchester United; they did lift it in 2012, Didier Drogba the imperious hero of the hour against Bayern Munich. Their run to the final this year has been the impressive equal of City, seeing off the new Spanish champions Atletico Madrid without too much fuss, while only profligate finishing prevented them from running up a cricket score against the famous Real Madrid. If they make it tonight, it’ll be their second European Cup and their sixth major European trophy in total, having won a couple of Europa Leagues (2013, 2019) and Cup Winners Cups (1971, 1998) in the past.</p> <p><strong>Chelsea go into this match having lost three of their last four matches, including a painful defeat in the FA Cup final, and a loss at Aston Villa which could have cost them a top-four place. </strong>Another reason City are favourites, then … until you consider their recent form against Pep Guardiola’s side: a 1-0 win in the FA Cup semi, and a 2-1 victory in the league at the Etihad.</p> <p><strong>It’s easy to make a case for either side, then, which is exactly as it should be ahead of the European Cup final.</strong> Team news and assorted blether to follow. Kick off is at 8pm (local and BST). It’s on! </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-05-29T14:21:54.573Z\">at 3.21pm BST</time></p>  </div>","wordcount":"2293","firstPublicationDate":"2021-05-29T16:30:29Z","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2021-05-29T19:05:42Z","liveBloggingNow":"true","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/p/htggg","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ab548d7d3ef645fe7490b1f1811caac16ba4b33/0_0_3500_2100/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","isLive":"true","bodyText":"4 min: More space for Werner down the right.

Should City win, Carson will beat the 14-year gap between brief goalkeeping appearances made by Jimmy Rimmer, who was reserve keeper for Manchester United against Benfica in 1968, then played the first nine minutes for Aston Villa against Bayern Munich in 1982 before his shoulder gave way, young Nigel Spink coming on to become the unlikely hero. If we see third-choice Carson in action tonight, it’ll be one hell of a story, one way or the other. The pre-match thoughts of a slightly pensive Pep Guardiola ... “To have a chance to win the game, you have to attack. Of course you have to defend, we need everyone. I am sure the second half will be very different than the beginning. Chelsea play five in the back, we need specific players in that area.” ... and a relaxed, smiling Thomas Tuchel, both men talking to BT Sport. “We had some final words, but everything is said now. We have to do it, they know it, and it’s good that they know it, because it’s their quality, their team effort that can decide this match on our side. We have gone for a little bit of height, Timo and Kai have a good feeling for each other. It is a tough choice to leave Christian Pulisic out, but we need 15 or 16 today to finish this game, hopefully in a positive way. I hope we can start strong, but finish even stronger. It’s a huge opponent, a big game in Europe, and we are up for it.” A peek inside the Chelsea dressing room. City are the designated home side, but both teams will be able to play in their first-choice colours. As in the Premier League, it’s been decided there’s no clash between the sky blue of City and Chelsea’s royal hue. Petr Cech, Chelsea’s technical advisor and hero of 2012, talks to BT Sport, and appears up for this. “The last step is usually the hardest one. There is a big chance the game will go to penalties. I hope the team is ready and confident that we will win it. Manchester City are a tough team to beat. It will be an entertaining game, even though you expect it to be a tactical game.” A dip into the pre-match postbag. We’ll get to tonight’s match in good time, but first thing’s first. “As an English translator, resident in Lisbon for many years, I feel I must help with your translation of ‘It’s on’,” begins John Elliott, who may or may not have twigged that I don’t speak a word of Portuguese and was wholly reliant on Google Translate. “‘Ligado’ is ‘on’ in the sense of ‘electrically’ on or off. For your future reference, I think a much better and more idiomatic translation into Portuguese would be ‘Temos jogo!’ (We’ve got a game!).” Meanwhile your memories of the 1986 Full Members’ Cup final have been flooding in, in their twos. “I was there!” writes Matthew Holt. “Pat Nevin put in about four unplayable crosses for our goals, then in the last five mins City started scoring and were only stopped by the final whistle. A repeat today please, with the ghost of Wee Pat putting in a few for Werner to finish off!” Our resident Fife, Angus and Perth &amp; Kinross correspondent Simon McMahon adds: “Five Scots in the Chelsea team for that Full Members’ Cup Final, including of course Johnny Marr lookalike Pat Nevin, whose autobiography, The Accidental Footballer, is excellent by the way. Billy McNeill managing City too. Billy Gilmour, the only Scottish representative on the bench for Chelsea tonight, could have a Champions League winners medal at age 19. Doubt Nevin would swap his Full Members gong though.” Johnny Marr is a City fan, of course. I am The Weaver. Everyone thought Pep had given up tinkering, which hasn’t always been a successful pastime for him in this competition, but there’s a big surprise: a very attacking line-up with no holding player. Neither Fernandinho nor Rodri starts, which suggests Pep is expecting his side to enjoy the lion’s share of possession. That’s a brave call, as he’ll have to field a fair few questions should this go wrong. Ilkay Gundogan is fit after limping out of training yesterday, Raheem Sterling starts, Oleksandr Zinchenko gets the nod at left-back, and if Sergio Aguero is to be the epochal hero again, he’ll need to come on and do it as a sub. Another 94th-minute winner, anyone? Chelsea’s selection is comparatively understated. N’Golo Kante and Edouard Mendy are fit to play. Ben Chilwell is picked ahead of Marcos Alonso, while Timo Werner and Kai Havertz are the ones stationed up front alongside Mason Mount. Manchester City: Ederson, Walker, Dias, Stones, Zinchenko, Gundogan, De Bruyne, Bernardo, Mahrez, Sterling, Foden. Subs: Steffen, Carson, Ake, Jesus, Aguero, Laporte, Rodrigo, Torres, Mendy, Fernandinho, Cancelo, Garcia. Chelsea: Mendy, James, Thiago Silva, Rudiger, Azpilicueta, Kante, Jorginho, Chilwell, Mount, Havertz, Werner. Subs: Arrizabalaga, Alonso, Christensen, Pulisic, Caballero, Zouma, Kovacic, Giroud, Hudson-Odoi, Ziyech, Gilmour, Emerson Palmieri. Referee: Antonio Miguel Mateu Lahoz (Valencia). Manchester City and Chelsea have previously met in two other finals. There was the absurdity of the 2019 League Cup final, which City won on penalties but is already only remembered for the preposterous row between Maurizio Sarri and Kepa, who refused to come off. But never mind that. The big one was the 1986 Full Members’ Cup final, a nine-goal thriller that may never be topped in the eyes of a certain generation. Chelsea and City have come a long way since, but some things remain golden, no matter what. As for the managers themselves ... well, we all remember Thomas Tuchel sitting on the PSG icebox last year, his leg all bound up like the farmer in Withnail &amp; I. He’s zero for one, though by making it back immediately with Chelsea, he becomes the first man to take different clubs to the final in successive seasons. Pep Guardiola meanwhile is making his third appearance as a boss at the final, having won the thing with Barcelona in 2009 and 2011. If he makes it a hat-trick of wins today, he’ll become only the sixth coach in history to win the European Cup with two different clubs, getting his name on an elite list that so far includes Ernst Happel (Feyenoord 1970, Hamburg 1983), Ottmar Hitzfeld (Borussia Dortmund 1997, Bayern Munich 2001), José Mourinho (Porto 2004, Internazionale 2010), Jupp Heynckes (Real Madrid 1998, Bayern 2013) and Carlo Ancelotti (AC Milan 2003 and 2007, Real Madrid 2014). Throw in a couple of appearances as a player, winning in 1992 and losing in 1994 with Barca, and that’s quite the relationship with Europe’s showpiece event. This is virgin territory for nearly everyone involved (if you ignore the managers, that is). Only one member of each squad has previously played in a Champions League final, and neither has particularly happy memories. İlkay Gündoğan turned out for Borussia Dortmund in 2013, scoring from the penalty spot in their 2-1 defeat by Bayern Munich. Thiago Silva meanwhile was captain of the Paris Saint-Germain team that lost to the very same Bavarian party-poopers last year. Mateo Kovačić was there for Real Madrid in 2017 and 2018, but only looking on as an unused substitute. Chelsea fans are also enjoying their big day out. Here’s one getting the top of his head coloured in. We’re assuming, given the ITV ident craze sweeping Porto, he asked for the LWT ribbon, only to be told the artist had no orange paint. No matter: Stamford the Lion will offer plenty of protection from those harmful UV rays, because it’s been a lovely warm and gloriously sunny day in Porto. Perfect conditions for the biggest game on the calendar. Fans of both teams have been out on the Super Bock. Here’s the best-dressed one. Apt, too. Granada were prime movers in the popularisation of the European Cup, their cameras on hand to transmit the exploits of the Busby Babes, Old Trafford being just down the road. The second leg of the 1957 semi between United and Real Madrid was the first to be transmitted live in its entirety on the all-new ITV, though only in the Granada region. The first four minutes were missed; well, there were ads still to show, and the ref wasn’t in the mood to delay kick-off, a decision that would have necessitated standing around in the cold. Welcome to our live MBM coverage of the 29th Champions League final … or if we’re doing things properly, paying proper heed to history and romance, the 66th European Cup final. Had things gone smoothly, we’d be at the Ataturk in Istanbul for the latest edition of the biggest and most glamorous club match in world football, but coronavirus has put paid to that, and so everyone’s made it to the easier-to-access Estádio do Dragão in Porto instead. A shame in one respect, given the other-worldly Ataturk would have been a fitting venue for the denouement of an unearthly season … but a day on the Douro is one heck of a Plan B. Está ligado! Manchester City are playing in their first European Cup final. It’s the end of a journey they began in 1968, when Malcolm Allison promised his and Joe Mercer’s English champions would set about Europe “as they have not been attacked since the days of the old Real Madrid … I think a lot of these European people are cowards.” Sure enough, having talked the big talk, they fell at the first hurdle against Fenerbahce. That brilliant Lee-Bell-Summerbee side brought home some European silverware in the end, winning the 1970 Cup Winners’ Cup, but that night everyone was watching the FA Cup final replay live in glorious technicolor on BBC1, City’s 2-1 win over Gornik Zabrze relegated to late-night black-and-white highlights over on 2. Hapless happenstance always used to befall City back in the day. Times change, though, and millions will be watching this evening as magisterial City finally look to make good on Allison’s words. City have scored 60 goals in their last 25 Champions League games. They’ve scored 25 in this campaign, letting in just four en route to the final. All this without a designated striker! They’re favourites tonight to win their second European bauble and their first European Cup. Chelsea, playing in their third European Cup final, will have something to say about that. The Pensioners should have won the trophy in 2008, only for John Terry to freeze in the moment against Manchester United; they did lift it in 2012, Didier Drogba the imperious hero of the hour against Bayern Munich. Their run to the final this year has been the impressive equal of City, seeing off the new Spanish champions Atletico Madrid without too much fuss, while only profligate finishing prevented them from running up a cricket score against the famous Real Madrid. If they make it tonight, it’ll be their second European Cup and their sixth major European trophy in total, having won a couple of Europa Leagues (2013, 2019) and Cup Winners Cups (1971, 1998) in the past. Chelsea go into this match having lost three of their last four matches, including a painful defeat in the FA Cup final, and a loss at Aston Villa which could have cost them a top-four place. Another reason City are favourites, then … until you consider their recent form against Pep Guardiola’s side: a 1-0 win in the FA Cup semi, and a 2-1 victory in the league at the Etihad. It’s easy to make a case for either side, then, which is exactly as it should be ahead of the European Cup final. Team news and assorted blether to follow. Kick off is at 8pm (local and BST).

companies, the testing centres do not have to furnish any documents to prove how many people they’ve tested when filing for government compensation and several have been inflating the figures. </p> <p>“They just have to send the number of tests [carried out], without any proof, and they are wired the money soon after,” according to a joint investigation by NDR and WDR public television and Suddeutsche Zeitung. </p> <p>As part of the effort, journalists counted the number of people who had come into the testing centres and then compared these numbers to what the establishments submitted to the government to get reimbursed. </p> <p>According to the investigation, one centre declared 422 tests, when only around 100 people had come in. Another filed for reimbursement of 1,743 tests done in a single day, when only 550 people had come in. </p> <p>The number of places offering free Covid-19 tests have mushroomed since the government introduced the free scheme - in the <strong>North Rhine-Westphalia</strong> region there are currently nearly 8,000 and the capital <strong>Berlin</strong> has at least 1,200. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-05-29T14:44:15.248Z\">at 3.44pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-60b24aac8f086d71cc15e759\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-05-29T14:09:42.105Z\">3.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Spain</strong> will allow cruise ships to dock in its ports from 7 June, the transport ministry said on Saturday, hoping to salvage the country’s battered tourism sector in time for the summer season. <br></p> <p>Reuters reports:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Spain’s maritime authorities approved the reopening because of falling Covid-19 incidence rates and an increase in vaccinations, according to an order in Spain’s state gazette published on Saturday. <br></p> <p>Spain banned cruise ships from docking in its ports in June 2020 as the pandemic ripped through Europe.

30s in <strong>England</strong> have received a coronavirus vaccine dose in a period of little over two weeks, new figures reveal. <br></p> <p>NHS England said that, since it began opening up the vaccine rollout to this age group on 13 May, about 53% of those aged 30 to 39 have been given at least one dose. <br></p> <p>Overall, more than 32 million people have been vaccinated with a first dose in England, almost three-quarters of the total adult population, while more than 20 million people have had both doses.</p> <p>People aged 30 to 31 were from Wednesday invited to get their jab, with more than 5m appointments made through the national booking service within 72 hours. <br></p> <p>The data comes as the NHS is asking people aged 50 and over, as well as those who are clinically vulnerable, to bring forward their second Covid-19 vaccination to help combat the spread of the B1.617.2 variant first identified in India. <br></p> <p>It follows the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) recommending earlier this month that the second dose interval be shortened from 12 weeks to eight for people in priority cohorts. <br></p> <p>NHS England said so far 600,000 people have been invited to rearrange their second jab through the national booking service, with around a quarter moving their appointment earlier. <br></p> <p>NHS England chief executive, <strong>Sir Simon Stevens,</strong> said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is remarkable that, in little over two weeks since people in their 30s began getting their invites, more than half have now had their first dose. <br></p> <p>This success is no happy accident but the result of months of careful planning and the sheer hard work and dedication of NHS staff. <br></p> <p>The Covid-19 vaccine is our most effective weapon against coronavirus and the best way of protecting yourself and loved ones, so, if you do one thing this bank holiday weekend, book your lifesaving jab and, crucially, if you’re contacted by the NHS to do so, bring forward your second dose of vital protection.</p> </blockquote> <p> Health secretary, <strong>Matt Hancock,</strong> said he was “absolutely thrilled” at the progress in the 30s age group and thanked those coming forward “to do their bit to defeat the virus”. <br></p> <p>He said: <br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As we enjoy the reopening of pubs and restaurants again, vaccines will play a crucial role in protecting us and those around us. <br></p> <p>Vaccines are the best way out of this pandemic and I urge everybody to take up the offer when eligible. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-05-29T12:51:42.032Z\">at 1.51pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div

There were tussles with police who tried to block access through one entrance to the shopping centre at about 6pm, before protesters quickly realised that another door just yards away was unguarded. Hundreds made it into the shopping centre where they stayed for about half an hour before the were cleared by police. The Westfield invasion came after a mass march snaking about 12 miles through London, starting in Parliament Square and reaching as far west as Hammersmith. At its height there appeared to be hundreds of thousands of people taking part. One protester, who would give his name only as Paul, from Bedfordshire, said he was taking part because he was scared about where the unprecedented crackdown on civil liberties under the pretext of fighting the pandemic would lead. “I’m frightened about our liberties. Or choice about whether we want to be vaccinated or not. Lots of people legitimately don’t have any faith in it at all.” Tens of thousands of protesters have poured on to the streets of Brazil’s largest cities to demand the impeachment of President Jair Bolsonaro over his catastrophic response to a coronavirus pandemic that has claimed nearly half a million Brazilian lives. The demonstrators turned out in more than 200 cities and towns for what is the biggest anti-Bolsonaro mobilisation since Brazil’s Covid outbreak began. Osvaldo Bazani da Silva, a 48-year-old hairdresser who lost his younger brother to Covid-19, said: “We can’t lose any more Brazilian lives. We need to hit the streets every single day until this government falls.” In Rio many marchers carried homemade placards remembering loved ones they have lost to an epidemic that has killed nearly 460,000 Brazilians, the world’s second largest official death toll after the US. “I’m here in his memory,” said Luiz Dantas, 18, clutching a photograph of his grandfather, Sebastião, who died in February aged 75. Lebanon vaccinated more than 10,000 people on Saturday as part of a day-long vaccine “marathon” organised by the health ministry to ramp up inoculation rates in the crisis-hit country. The ministry said that by 6.30pm (15.30 GMT), 10,452 people over the age of 30 received jabs of the AstraZeneca vaccine at different facilities across the country. They were allowed to enter vaccination centres on a walk-in basis from early Saturday morning in what health authorities have dubbed a vaccine “marathon”. The capital Beirut and some other parts of the country were excluded from the initiative, but outgoing health minister Hamad Hassan said there were plans for a second such event that would cover more areas, AFP reports. Hundreds of maskless protesters demonstrated against coronavirus restrictions in front of EU buildings in Brussels on Saturday, with many yelling “Freedom” and claiming Covid-19 was no worse than the flu. The protest started in a major city park and marched towards a square where EU offices, including the European Commission building, are located, AFP reports. Belgian police blocked access to the square with barbed wire and a line of 40 officers in riot gear prevented demonstrators moving closer. A water cannon idled nearby, but was not used, and the protest dispersed after around four hours. A fundraiser to create a memorial in St Paul’s Cathedral for those who have died in the Covid-19 pandemic has reached its £2.3m goal in under a month. An online book of remembrance will be installed in a portico structure within the London cathedral. St Paul’s set up the Remember Me project, an online book of remembrance for Covid-19 victims, in May 2020. More than 9,400 names have been added to the book so far, along with photographs and tributes. On its fundraising page, the cathedral said that it “hopes to create a memorial that people can go through into a tranquil space, draw breath and take a moment to remember the many individuals, loved and cherished, who have died as a result of the pandemic”. France reported the number of people in intensive care units with Covid-19 fell by 76 to 3,028 on Saturday, while the overall number of people in hospital with the disease fell by 425 to 16,847. Both numbers have been on a downward trend in recent weeks. The health ministry also reported 68 new coronavirus deaths in hospitals, bringing the total to 82,946. Thousands of people, masked and tested for the coronavirus, packed inside a Paris arena for a concert Saturday as part of a public health experiment to prepare France to host large scale events. Associated Press reports: The show at AccorHotels Arena in eastern Paris features 1980s French rock band Indochine and DJ Etienne de Crecy. But the attention was mostly on the concert-goers. The Paris public hospital authority helped organize the event to determine whether it’s safe to allow 5,000 masked people to dance together in the open pit of an indoor concert arena without social distancing. The attendees are seeing the show for free but were required to take three virus tests, two before and one after the concert. To further reduce risk, organisers only allowed people 18-45 years old without underlying health conditions to participate, according to the hospital authority. France has not allowed such music concerts since early 2020. Cultural venues were shut for most of the past 14 months as authorities tried to contain persistent surges of virus infections that filled hospitals and were linked to more than 109,000 deaths. My colleague Damien Gayle is covering the protest through London in opposition to vaccine passports and coronavirus lockdowns. The anti-lockdown march is the latest in a series of large protests against the UK government’s coronavirus measures. Large crowds of football fans took over Porto’s riverside area on Saturday ahead of the Champions League final between Chelsea and Manchester City. Some 16,500 fans will be allowed into the stadium when the match kicks off at 8 p.m. but many others travelled to support their teams from the sidelines. Dozens of packed planes touched down at the city’s airport on Saturday morning. The fans from England were largely maskless and did not socially distance, to the annoyance of some locals, Reuters reports. In Portugal, masks are still mandatory outside if people cannot observe social distancing. Ines Andrade, a 19-year-old student from Porto, was visibly upset as she watched the scenes from nearby, saying it was “revolting” to see how fans were behaving, just four months after Portugal faced its toughest battle against Covid-19. “For us, Portuguese, is it very disturbing to see these people come here and ruin everything we have tried to achieve over the last months and year.” Fans had to present a negative Covid-19 test on arrival at the airport. But there has been concern in Portugal that the event could fuel a spike in cases after authorities decided to relax coronavirus rules for the match. Portugal is on the British government’s “green” list allowing tourists to visit the country without quarantining on their return. An update from the UK’s health secretary. Germany will introduce stricter controls on the administering of coronavirus tests, health minister Jens Spahn said on Saturday, after local media reports accused some centres of accounting fraud. “There will be more random checks,” Spahn said on Twitter. “Pragmatism is necessary these days. Those who exploit that must not be allowed to get away with it.” Germany offers its citizens at least one free coronavirus test per week, with several federal states providing one free test a day. The state pays €18 (£15.46) per test. Many private test centres have been set up in recent weeks, Reuters reports. Some coronavirus test centres have been charging for more tests than they have carried out, daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung and broadcaster ARD reported this week. Prosecutors in the city of Bochum opened an investigation into one centre following the reports. Carmakers in the Indian automobile hub of Chennai, in Tamil Nadu, will be allowed to keep operating, the state government said, amid protests by workers who fear catching Covid-19 in one of the country’s hardest-hit states. Tamil Nadu authorities extended a near-total lockdown on Friday as coronavirus infections and deaths rise in the southern state, where average cases run at more than 30,000 a day, official figures show, Reuters reports. But a government order issued on Saturday said so-called continuous process industries, which include auto factories, would be allowed to function in accordance with measures such as social distancing to stem the virus’s spread. It also urged vehicle manufacturers to initiate immediate action to vaccinate all their employees within a month. Italy reported 83 coronavirus-related deaths on Saturday compared with 126 the day before, the health ministry said. The daily tally of new infections fell to 3,351 from 3,738, Reuters reports. Italy has registered 126,002 deaths linked to Covid-19 since its outbreak in February last year, the second-highest toll in Europe after Britain and the seventh-highest in the world. The country has reported 4.213 million cases to date. The number of patients in hospital with Covid-19 – not including those in intensive care – stood at 6,800 on Saturday, down from 7,192 a day earlier. The UK government said a further seven people had died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19 as of Saturday, bringing the UK total to 127,775. Separate figures published by the Office for National Statistics show there have been 153,000 deaths registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate. The government also said that, as of 9am on Saturday, there had been a further 3,398 lab-confirmed cases in the UK. It brings the total to 4,480,945. Vietnam’s health minister Nguyen Thanh Long said on Saturday the country had detected a new variant of the coronavirus, which is a mix of the India and UK variants and spreads quickly by air, the online newspaper VnExpress reported. The World Health Organization has not yet responded to the finding. India has recorded the lowest number of new daily infections in 45 days, the Times of India reports, although a further 173,790 fresh cases were logged in the country on Saturday. Malaysia reported 9,020 new coronavirus cases on Saturday, the highest daily rise since the start of the pandemic. More than half of people in their 30s in England have received a coronavirus vaccine dose in a little over two weeks. Infections in Germany continue to fall, with the country’s seven-day incidence now at 37.5 nationwide, down from 39.8 on Friday and 66.8 in the previous week. Victoria state in Australia has recorded five new locally acquired cases of coronavirus – with four linked to a food distribution delivery driver – as the state enters its second day of its fourth lockdown. The southern Chinese city of Guangzhou shut down a neighbourhood and ordered its residents to stay at home on Saturday for door-to-door coronavirus testing following a fast rise in infections. Launching a Covid immunisation programme for children should be considered only in special circumstances, leading health experts have warned. A coronavirus surge sweeping through Thailand’s prisons has thrown the spotlight on the kingdom’s overcrowded penal system, where some inmates have less space to sleep than the inside of a coffin. Scotland’s health secretary, Humza Yousaf, said there was “significant community transmission” of coronavirus in hotspots in the city of Glasgow. Lebanon’s health authorities have launched a Covid-19 vaccination “marathon” to speed up inoculations around the country, including areas where turnout has been low. Spain will allow cruise ships to dock in its ports from 7 June, the transport ministry said on Saturday. That’s it from me, my colleague Nadeem Badshah will be taking over shortly. Prosecutors in several German regions have launched investigations of companies offering free Covid-19 tests after news reports said that some were padding their numbers to claim more money from the government. Prosecutors raided a company in the northwestern city of Bochum on Friday, according to the Suddeutsche Zeitung newspaper, while farther north in Luebeck, prosecutors have opened a fraud probe, the WirtschaftsWoche weekly said. In Cologne, authorities carried out a surprise control of a testing centre, and the city of Munster has revoked the license of a company that operates around 50 testing centres. In an effort to boost Covid-19 testing, the German government made testing free several weeks ago, reimbursing companies up to €18 ($22) for each test conducted. But according to a joint investigation by several media companies, the testing centres do not have to furnish any documents to prove how many people they’ve tested when filing for government compensation and several have been inflating the figures. “They just have to send the number of tests [carried out], without any proof, and they are wired the money soon after,” according to a joint investigation by NDR and WDR public television and Suddeutsche Zeitung. As part of the effort, journalists counted the number of people who had come into the testing centres and then compared these numbers to what the establishments submitted to the government to get reimbursed. According to the investigation, one centre declared 422 tests, when only around 100 people had come in. Another filed for reimbursement of 1,743 tests done in a single day, when only 550 people had come in. The number of places offering free Covid-19 tests have mushroomed since the government introduced the free scheme - in the North Rhine-Westphalia region there are currently nearly 8,000 and the capital Berlin has at least 1,200. Spain will allow cruise ships to dock in its ports from 7 June, the transport ministry said on Saturday, hoping to salvage the country’s battered tourism sector in time for the summer season. Reuters reports: Spain’s maritime authorities approved the reopening because of falling Covid-19 incidence rates and an increase in vaccinations, according to an order in Spain’s state gazette published on Saturday. Spain banned cruise ships from docking in its ports in June 2020 as the pandemic ripped through Europe. A number of high-profile spreader events were linked to cruise liners around the world. “Shipping companies will have to comply with measures established by the health ministry [...] to guarantee total security, both for cruise passengers and for the cities where they land,” the transport ministry tweeted on Saturday. It added that before the pandemic, Spain was the second most popular destination for international cruises in Europe. Spain, which was also the second most visited country in the world before the health crisis, was one of Europe’s worst-hit nations, recording over 79,000 coronavirus deaths and 3.7 million cases. Foreign tourism plunged 80% last year as a raft of restrictions brought the industry to a standstill. But with infection rates falling, vaccinations progressing, and most regions able to scrap curfews, Spain is looking towards reopening its vital tourism industry this summer. Last week Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez announced Spain would allow people from anywhere in the world to enter the country from 7 Jun, provided they were vaccinated. Tens of thousands of protesters have begun marching through central London in opposition to vaccine passports and coronavirus lockdowns. The anti-lockdown march, the latest in a series of large protests against the government’s coronavirus measures, began at 1pm in Parliament Square and made its way north to Oxford Street. Protesters chanted “freedom” and sang along to Bob Marley’s Three Little Birds as the they waved placards proclaiming slogans such as “we know where the rabbit hole ends”. The route of the march was not disclosed before it began. Activists at the front were directing the crowd via a series of coloured smoke signals. Louise Creffield, the founder of Save Our Rights UK, one of the groups behind the protest, told the Guardian the focus was on medical freedom. She said: We’re very concerned about the track and trace being turned into vaccine passports and the increase in mandated testing. We’re campaigning for a medical freedom bill which would prevent any coercion and any discrimination for not partaking in a medical procedure, because where there’s that there can’t be fair and informed consent. Once we lose our medical freedom there is no saying if and when we will get it back and where this slippery slope could take us. We’ve seen a huge amount of mission creep this year, so there’s no telling where it could go. In a Telegram post published the day before the protest, Save Our Rights UK said they planned to take the march on a different route to those in previous weeks. The post said: “This won’t be a scenic walk, we will be taking our message to community areas that we haven’t hit before and WE WILL BE STAYING AT THE END LOCATION AS LONG AS POSSIBLE.” Lebanon’s health authorities have launched a Covid-19 vaccination “marathon” to speed up inoculations around the country, including areas where turnout has so far been low. The Associated Press reports: The daylong campaign offered AstraZeneca vaccines at 30 different centers around the country without prior appointment to encourage people over age 30 to show up. The capital Beirut was not included in the campaign. A vaccination program that started in February targeted older age groups, primarily through registration on a government-operated platform and appointments. As of Saturday afternoon, 7,700 people had been vaccinated in the push. Pictures of lines outside centers north of Beirut showed turnout was high, particularly among foreign workers, many of whom had been reluctant or unable to register on the government-operated digital platform. There were also lines in towns and villages in the east and mountains, where turnout has so far been fickle. Lebanon has managed to curb the number of new virus cases since the start of the year. The small country, reeling from a crippling economic crisis that predated the pandemic, is eager to restore economic activities. Officials want to open up businesses and tourist attractions ahead of the summer season to draw in much needed foreign currency. So far, over 700,000 people have been vaccinated in the country of 6 million. More than 530,000 have been infected with over 7,700 deaths since February 2020. Restrictions in place since the start of 2021 have eased over the last few weeks, allowing restaurants, bars and malls to reopen and receive customers until late. “We are living many crises and our way to revive our economic life and restore some Lebanese social and culture norms forces us to think of greater ways for immunization in shorter periods,” Lebanon’s health minister Hamad Hassan told a local TV station. Launching a Covid immunisation programme for children should be considered only in special circumstances, leading health experts have warned. They say UK medical authorities, who are currently studying how vaccines for adolescents might be administered, should move with great care over the implementation of such a programme. They acknowledge it could help reduce outbreaks and the spread of Covid but also warn it could also raise important practical and ethical problems. Doctors would be giving vaccines for which there was limited information about possible side-effects to children who have nothing to gain from such a move, said Prof Adam Finn of Bristol University. “Children transmit Covid to some extent, although they rarely suffer badly from the disease themselves. If you offer them vaccines, then you put them at risk of possible side-effects – so there really needs to be some significant, tangible benefit to them, not just the indirect protection of adults from Covid-19.” The preparation of plans to give Covid vaccines to UK children comes in the wake of the US decision to launch such a programme and at a time when Germany has indicated it is planning a similar move. Canada and Switzerland have also approved plans, while the European Medicines Agency (EMA) last week agreed to extend approval for the use of the Pfizer vaccine on 12- to 15-year-olds. But the move to vaccinate children has been criticised by global health leaders, including the head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who earlier this month said that although he understood why some countries wanted to vaccinate children and adolescents, he urged them to reconsider. My colleague Robin McKie reports. More than half of people in their 30s in England have received a coronavirus vaccine dose in a period of little over two weeks, new figures reveal. NHS England said that, since it began opening up the vaccine rollout to this age group on 13 May, about 53% of those aged 30 to 39 have been given at least one dose. Overall, more than 32 million people have been vaccinated with a first dose in England, almost three-quarters of the total adult population, while more than 20 million people have had both doses. People aged 30 to 31 were from Wednesday invited to get their jab, with more than 5m appointments made through the national booking service within 72 hours. The data comes as the NHS is asking people aged 50 and over, as well as those who are clinically vulnerable, to bring forward their second Covid-19 vaccination to help combat the spread of the B1.617.2 variant first identified in India. It follows the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) recommending earlier this month that the second dose interval be shortened from 12 weeks to eight for people in priority cohorts. NHS England said so far 600,000 people have been invited to rearrange their second jab through the national booking service, with around a quarter moving their appointment earlier. NHS England chief executive, Sir Simon Stevens, said: It is remarkable that, in little over two weeks since people in their 30s began getting their invites, more than half have now had their first dose. This success is no happy accident but the result of months of careful planning and the sheer hard work and dedication of NHS staff. The Covid-19 vaccine is our most effective weapon against coronavirus and the best way of protecting yourself and loved ones, so, if you do one thing this bank holiday weekend, book your lifesaving jab and, crucially, if you’re contacted by the NHS to do so, bring forward your second dose of vital protection. Health secretary, Matt Hancock, said he was “absolutely thrilled” at the progress in the 30s age group and thanked those coming forward “to do their bit to defeat the virus”. He said: As we enjoy the reopening of pubs and restaurants again, vaccines will play a crucial role in protecting us and those around us. Vaccines are the best way out of this pandemic and I urge everybody to take up the offer when eligible. The Duchess of Cambridge has been given her first dose of a coronavirus vaccine. A message from the 39-year-old on the Kensington Palace Twitter account said: “Yesterday I received my first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine at London’s Science Museum. “I’m hugely grateful to everyone who is playing a part in the rollout – thank you for everything you are doing.” I’m Jedidajah Otte and will be taking back over now for the next few hours. If you have anything you’d like to flag you can reach me on Twitter @JedySays. Launching a programme of Covid-19 immunisations for children should be considered only in special circumstances, leading health experts have warned. Offering vaccines to children – who “rarely suffer badly from the disease themselves” – could raise important practical and ethical problems, they said. Meanwhile, the head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also urged countries to reconsider vaccinating children when lower-income countries do not have enough doses to immunise vulnerable populations. In contrast, Klaus Okkenhaug, professor of immunology in the department of pathology at the University of Cambridge, said this morning that “it would of course help for children to be vaccinated because it also reduces their opportunities to transmit this virus to their teachers”. He added that although it was “a little bit of a fine balance because they are so unlikely to be affected by the virus”, he believes there’s “a good argument” for vaccinating over-12s, given the “phenomenal safety records” of some available vaccines. The organiser of the Edinburgh Fringe has said the world’s largest arts festival is “in danger” if the Scottish government does not ease social distancing rules for venues within a fortnight. Shona McCarthy, chief executive of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe Society, called on ministers to replace the current two-metre rule with the one-metre rule used in hospitality in order to help secure the future of the 75-year-old festival. McCarthy told the Times Scotland: “Within another two weeks, it’s going to be impossible for any [Edinburgh promoter] to put on anything. “There’s a real danger for the future of the Fringe. One year of no festival was manageable, and we were able to keep it in hearts and minds and everybody still held that space in their calendar, as that annual moment for reconnection and getting together. At two years, you jeopardise the solid space the Fringe has held for 75 years.” She urged the government to “have that leap of faith” and trust venues to deliver services safely in the same way as the hospitality sector. The UK government appears to have abandoned its “data not dates” principle, an expert advising its coronavirus response has warned, adding that its reluctance to delay unlocking was leading to “contradictory” messaging. Prof Stephen Reicher, a psychologist on the Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours (Spi-B), joined scientists warning against the final lifting of restrictions on 21 June as cases passed 4,000 for the first time since late March on Friday. Reicher said the government had invested “so much political capital” in particular dates that it has become difficult to diverge from them if the data suggests it is necessary. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I think we are in a pickle of the government’s own making at the moment. I think the reason for that is it has departed from its own mantra of ‘data not dates’. Very quickly ‘data not dates’ became ‘dates not data’.” Hello, this is Clea Skopeliti taking over the blog for the next hour while Jedidajah has a break. You can message me on Twitter if you’d like to draw my attention to a story. Thanks! Indonesia will introduce a “Work From Bali” programme for civil servants aimed at helping to revive the island’s battered economy. Bloomberg reports: The coordinating ministry for maritime and investment affairs will start with a pilot project in Nusa Dua, once a prime location for major conferences including the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in 2013, to encourage more meetings and outbound activities on the island. “We hope that with the arrival of government and state-owned company employees, the gears of Bali’s economy will start moving,” Hermin Esti Setyowati, an assistant deputy at the ministry, said in a statement on Saturday. Tourism-reliant Bali has been among the country’s hardest-hit provinces as borders remain shut, leaving its hotels and beaches empty. Its GDP shrank 9.9% in the first quarter from a year ago, following a 9.3% contraction for all of 2020. The island welcomed just 25 foreigners from January to March, compared with 1.1 million in the same period last year. The local government plans to accelerate its vaccination program with a goal of reaching herd immunity against Covid-19 by July, which could allow the island to reopen to international tourists. There is a “good argument” for vaccinating older children against Covid-19 given the safety records of some Covid vaccines, an expert has said. Klaus Okkenhaug, professor of immunology in the department of pathology at the University of Cambridge, told Times Radio that the decision on whether to give children coronavirus jabs was a “difficult question” that requires balancing wider benefits against the direct ones for children. He said: I think for a whole population it would of course help for children to be vaccinated because it also reduces their opportunities to transmit this virus to their teachers. Prof Okkenhaug said that when considering the “direct benefits to the children” it was “a little bit of a fine balance because they are so unlikely to be affected by the virus”. He added: But I think given the phenomenal safety records of some of the vaccines out there, there’s a good argument for going ahead at least with older children, say 12 and above. A coronavirus surge sweeping through Thailand’s prisons has thrown the spotlight on the kingdom’s overcrowded penal system, where some inmates have less space to sleep than the inside of a coffin. AFP reports: More than 22,000 people have tested positive inside jails, where inmates living cheek by jowl have been encouraged to keep wearing their masks even while they sleep. Authorities have floated plans to give early releases to prisoners with underlying medical conditions and have announced funding for more testing and medical care in recent days. But those behind bars say they have been kept in the dark about the seriousness of the outbreak. “Prisoners don’t have the knowledge to protect themselves,” said Somyot Prueksakasemsuk, a high-profile activist facing charges under Thailand’s harsh royal defamation law. Somyot was bailed last month and told AFP that he had not been tested for Covid-19 once during his 10-week stint in custody. He was not worried about contracting the disease while in jail because he had no idea about the level of risk. “But after this I’m so scared [for everyone still inside] ... if you are inside the prison you are at risk, it’s unavoidable,” he said. Thailand’s prison outbreak has skyrocketed from just 10 publicly announced cases a month ago and sparked growing public concern after a handful of prominent activists contracted the illness. Among them was student leader Panusaya “Rung” Sithijirawattanakul, who helped lead a series of rallies last year demanding political reforms in the kingdom, and who tested positive after she was released on bail. The Thai prison population stood at around 311,000 earlier this year, the International Federation for Human Rights said – more than two and a half times the system’s official capacity. Four inmates in every five are serving time for drug charges because of harsh anti-narcotics laws that can see offenders jailed for a decade for possessing just a few methamphetamine pills. Many cells are so packed with bodies that some inmates only have half a metre (less than 2ft) of space. “That is less room for a body than the inside of a coffin,” justice minister Somsak Thepsutin told local media in February. Officials have tested more than 36,000 inmates in recent weeks and begun delivering Covid vaccines to inmates and prison staff. Somsak said he was examining ways to give early releases to prisoners with underlying medical conditions, possibly through a royal pardon. Even if the plan goes ahead, prisoners will still have to complete a quarantine before returning home. India has recorded the lowest number of new daily infections in 45 days, the Times of India reports, although a further 173,790 fresh cases were logged in the country on Saturday. The official death toll climbed to 322,512 as a further 3,617 Covid fatalities recorded on Saturday, according to health ministry data. Daily recoveries continue to outnumber the daily new cases for the 16th consecutive day. A total of 2,080,048 samples were tested in the last 24 hours, according to the Indian Council of Medical Research. The governing civic body of Mumbai on Friday allowed walk-in vaccination for students who have been accepted for university courses abroad and require immunisation to travel. France’s budget deficit for 2021 will stand at €220bn, some €47bn higher than previously estimated, Olivier Dussopt, the public accounts minister, told AFP on Saturday. The increase is “a result of supporting measures that we’re continuing to take to support the recovery” from the devastating effects that Covid-19 shutdowns wreaked on the eurozone’s second-largest economy, he said. It is not yet clear how the revised numbers will affect the budget deficit when expressed as percentage of GDP, which was previously forecast to hit 9% this year, a postwar record. Public debt was previously forecast to reach 118% of GDP. The Covid-19 pandemic is expected to cost the French state nearly half a trillion euros over three years - €158bn in 2020, an expected €171bn in 2021 and a forecast €96bn in 2022, Dussopt said in April. France has borrowed heavily to try to keep the economy afloat through three nationwide lockdowns, including money spent on supporting salaries of people furloughed and aid for companies struggling to stay afloat during the crisis. The southern Chinese city of Guangzhou shut down a neighborhood and ordered its residents to stay home on Saturday for door-to-door coronavirus testing following an upsurge in infections. Guangzhou, a business and industrial centre of 15 million people north of Hong Hong, has reported 20 new infections over the past week. The number is small compared with India’s thousands of daily cases but has alarmed Chinese authorities who believed they had the virus under control. The spread of infections was “fast and strong,” the Global Times newspaper cited health authorities as saying. Saturday’s order to stay home applied to residents of five streets in Liwan district in the city centre. Outdoor markets, childcare centres and entertainment venues were closed. Indoor restaurant dining was prohibited, while grade schools were told to stop in-person tuition. People in parts of four nearby districts were ordered to limit outdoor activity. The city government earlier ordered testing of hundreds of thousands of residents following the initial infections. The government said some 700,000 people had been tested by Wednesday. China reports a handful of new cases every day but says almost all are believed to be people who were infected abroad, the Associated Press reports. The mainland’s official death toll stands at 4,636 out of 91,061 confirmed cases. On Saturday, the National Health Commission reported two new locally transmitted cases in Guangzhou and 14 in other parts of the country that it said came from abroad. Most of the latest infections in Guangzhou are believed to be linked to a 75-year-old woman who was found on 21 May to have the variant first identified in India, state media say. Most of the others attended a dinner with her or live together. That infection spread to the nearby city of Nanshan, where one new confirmed case and two asymptomatic cases were reported Saturday after people from Guangzhou were tested, according to the Global Times. Infections in Germany continue on a downward trend, according to the country’s Robert Koch Institute (RKI), with health authorities having reported 5,426 new cases within one day to the institute, down from 6,419 a week earlier. The seven-day incidence on Saturday morning stood at 37.5 nationwide, down from 39.8 on Friday and 66.8 in the previous week. Public holidays have, however, resulted in fewer people seeing a doctor, which means fewer samples are taken and fewer laboratory tests. Therefore, fewer new infections are reported. According to the RKI, 163 new deaths were recorded across Germany within 24 hours. A week ago 170 deaths from the virus were logged. The RKI has counted 3,675,296 Covid-19 infections since the beginning of the pandemic, but the actual total number is likely significantly higher, since many infections are not detected. The Philippines said on Saturday people were allowed to again go to work in Saudi Arabia, reversing a brief deployment ban after the kingdom said they would not be charged for Covid-19 tests and quarantine upon arrival. Reuters reports: “Our Saudi-bound workers will no longer be disadvantaged,” said labour secretary, Silvestre Bello. Flag carrier Philippine Airlines said it would accept Filipino workers on flights to Dammam and Riyadh, waiving rebooking fees for passengers who had been unable to board because of the deployment ban. Bello apologised for the “inconvenience and momentary anguish” caused by his Thursday ban, saying: “I understand that the suspension order drew confusion and irritation among our affected departing overseas Filipino workers.” More than a million Filipinos work in Saudi Arabia, the most preferred destination of overseas Filipino workers in 2019, government data shows. Many Filipinos are hired as construction workers, domestic helpers or nurses. In 2020, Filipinos in Saudi Arabia sent home $1.8bn in remittances, a key support for the consumption-led economy. With more than 1.2 million cases and 20,722 deaths, the Philippines has the second-highest Covid-19 infections and casualties in south-east Asia, behind Indonesia. People should be “very concerned” about the spread of the Indian variant of coronavirus, but “reassured” by the scale of the vaccine rollout, an expert has said. Professor Anthony Harnden, deputy chair of the UK’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), told BBC Breakfast that the variant was “clearly more transmissible”. He said: We need to be reassured that we’re in a very different position now in that we’ve got a highly vaccinated population and we just need to continue moving at speed. We do know that with this particular variant you do need two doses to offer complete protection, and so we’re very, very keen to make sure that all those, particularly higher risk groups, that’s the over-50s and those with underlying illness, receive their second vaccination as soon as feasible. The unlocking of society in England will be a “gradual process” that requires a “cautious” approach even if the government’s target date for removing all legal limits on social contact in the country on 21 June remains in place, he added, emphasising the need to “look very carefully” at what happens with the India variant in the next one or two weeks. He said: I think we need to look at that data very carefully before we completely un-lockdown. He suggested it was “better” to be on “the cautious side”, adding: Even if we do un-lockdown, if you are in a vulnerable position, particularly if you’ve not been vaccinated, you do need to carry on being cautious, even if the 21 June date goes ahead. So I think we’ve all got used to living within boundaries at the moment and I think it’s not an all or none, I think it will be a gradual process even if the 21 June date goes ahead. Scotland’s health secretary Humza Yousaf said there was “significant community transmission” of coronavirus in hotspots in the city of Glasgow. The city will remain under level 3 of Scotland’s restrictions until at least 5 June and Yousaf said urgent work was being carried out to understand the outbreak in south Glasgow and how the India variant arrived. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today: In a few concentrated hotspots ... we are seeing significant community transmission. The levels and the numbers of cases are continuing to rise. In other parts of the country “local health teams tell us they are relatively contained outbreaks” linked to either schools or domestic clusters, but that was not the case in Glasgow. What we are seeing is it’s coming in in areas where there is a large, diverse community so therefore there is a probability the variant has come in from international travel. Therefore we are trying to get to the bottom of how it managed to get in. Victoria state in Australia has recorded five new locally acquired cases of coronavirus, with four linked to a food distribution delivery driver, as the state enters its second day of its fourth lockdown. The update brings the total number of cases from the latest outbreak in Melbourne to 35. A record 56,624 tests were conducted in the 24 hours to Saturday morning, surpassing the previous day’s record of 47,462 tests. On Saturday, the state’s Covid testing commander, Jeroen Weimar, said four of the new cases were linked to a person who tested positive on Friday. The Victorian health minister, Martin Foley, said the person was a food distribution delivery driver who visited “multiple stores and grocery sites across metropolitan Melbourne on 18 and 19 May”. There are now more than 150 exposure sites and more than 15,000 primary and secondary contacts who must self-isolate after coming into potential contact with a person with Covid-19. Foley said the individual “worked during their infectious period” but they “showed no signs of Covid symptoms themselves”. He also thanked the food distribution company and customers for working with contact tracers. Weimar said four of the new cases announced on Saturday were household contacts of the delivery driver, including a student at Mount Ridley college in Craigieburn. He said these four people had only been in isolation for one day. The fifth case was separate, and was an employee of firm Stratton Finance who became infected at a display home in Mickleham. Late on Friday the Victorian health department announced new tier 1 exposure sites – where people are most at risk of catching and spreading the virus. A full list of exposure sites can be found here. Foley announced what he called a “hat-trick of records”, as the state administered a record number of tests and vaccinations over the past three days. Taiwan reported 486 new domestic Covid-19 cases on Saturday, including 166 cases added to the totals for recent days as it continues to readjust its infection numbers following delays in reporting positive tests. After successfully keeping coronavirus at bay, Taiwan is currently in the grip of its first serious outbreak. The island is desperately seeking vaccines to protect its people, and Taiwan’s neighbour China has offered to help, the BBC reported. Up until the mid-May, the country had logged only around 1,500 infections and 12 deaths, before cases began to rise sharply. On Tuesday, health minister Chen Shih-chung announced 2m vaccine doses would arrive in Taiwan in June, and 10m by the end of August. Russia reported 9,289 new Covid-19 cases on Saturday, including 3,241 in Moscow, taking the official national tally since the pandemic began to 5,053,748. The government coronavirus task force said 401 people had died of coronavirus-linked causes in the past 24 hours, pushing the national death toll to 120,807. The federal statistics agency has kept a separate count and has said Russia recorded around 250,000 deaths related to Covid-19 from April 2020 to March 2021. Malaysia reported 9,020 new coronavirus cases on Saturday, the highest daily toll since the start of the pandemic. This is the fifth straight day of record new infections, bringing the total number of cases in the country to 558,534. The country’s prime minister, Muhyiddin Yassin, has announced a nationwide “total lockdown” from 1 to 14 June that will apply to all social and economic areas, with only essential services and economic sectors listed by the national security council remaining in operation, ABC reports. “With the latest rise in daily cases showing a drastically upward trend, hospital capacity across the country to treat Covid-19 patients are becoming limited,” Muhyiddin said in a statement. Prof Stephen Reicher, a psychologist on the UK’s Sage sub-committee advising the government on behavioural science, said “confusion” over the government’s approach was undermining efforts to control the pandemic. Ahead of the planned 21 June easing of restrictions in England, he said the government was in a “pickle” because it appeared to have abandoned the “data, not dates” principle. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today: The data we are seeing at the moment suggests we have a problem. We don’t know how big the problem is - it might be bad, it might be very bad, we will learn in the next week or two. But the problem for the government is: on the one hand it can’t delay what it has been promising for so long, but on the other hand it is aware of the dangers of so doing. And so you see that in the fact that they are beginning to act in a rather contradictory way. They’re saying to us, for instance on travel: ‘you can travel internationally but please don’t’. They say of social contact ‘you can hug, but please don’t hug’. They say of restrictions, ‘no restrictions but please don’t go in and out of the hotspots’. That contradiction, that sense of confusion, I think is undermining the response. Hello and welcome to our global coronavirus live blog. Vietnam health minister Nguyen Thanh Long said on Saturday the country has detected a new variant of the coronavirus, which is a mix of the India and UK Covid-19 variants and spreads quickly by air, online newspaper VnExpress reported. Vietnam’s latest coronavirus wave, which began about a month ago, has seen 3,595 local Covid-19 cases so far in 33 cities and provinces. He said the coronavirus responsible for the new wave is much more transmissible, especially in the air. Viral cultures in the laboratory revealed that the virus replicated itself very quickly, he added, explaining why there are so many new cases in different locations in a shorter time frame. So far, Vietnam has recorded the presence of seven coronavirus variants, including ones from the UK, India and South Africa.

Caution is needed in determining whether England’s coronavirus restrictions can be lifted next month or “things will get bad very, very quickly”, a professor whose argument against herd immunity helped trigger the first lockdown has warned. Sir Tim Gowers, a professor of mathematics at the University of Cambridge, told the Guardian the downside of being “a bit more cautious” was a lot smaller than the downside of getting it wrong, as UK Covid cases rose by 4,184 on Friday – the highest increase since 1 April. Asked about the next step in lockdown easing in England, due on June 21, Prof Gowers said he did not believe the plans were necessarily at risk, but urged caution. He said: Because Boris Johnson has made a big thing about all the steps being irreversible, I think he’s put himself in a position where once he takes a step, he’ll be extremely reluctant to reverse because that would be a big U-turn, an embarrassing climbdown. So I think if that’s the way you’re going to play things, then you should be very, very cautious about every step you take ... And maybe everything [will] be OK, maybe the number of people who are vaccinated will be just enough ... ‘R’ will broadly speaking stay below one even with Indian variants. But if it’s not OK, we know, because of mathematics, that things will get bad very, very quickly. Or at least, maybe it won’t look that quick to start with, but it’ll grow exponentially. So it’ll pick up speed and become a big problem. Read my colleague Ben Quinn’s full story here. Prof Christina Pagel, a member of Independent Sage from University College London, said reopening should be delayed a few more months.","charCount":"47849","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/nadeembadshah\">Nadeem Badshah</a> (now), and <a href=\"profile/jedidajah-otte\">Jedidajah Otte</a> and <a href=\"profile/clea-skopeliti\">Clea Skopeliti</a> (earlier)"},{"headline":"We faced an unprecedented crisis, but tens of thousands of second wave Covid deaths were avoidable – and unforgivable","standfirst":"<p>Boris Johnson has shown a reluctance to take difficult decisions, with deadly consequences, the Labour leader writes</p><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/may/29/keir-starmer-boris-johnsons-botches-could-hit-june-plan-to-lift-lockdown\">Keir Starmer: Johnson’s botches could hit lockdown lifting</a></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus – latest updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul>","trailText":"Boris Johnson is accused of a reluctance to take difficult decisions, which cost lives, the Labour leader writes","byline":"Keir Starmer","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"23c3e558d921394db6af59e26593ff917827aa7b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23c3e558d921394db6af59e26593ff917827aa7b/0_76_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A coronavirus patient\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A coronavirus patient receiving treatment; 127,775 people have died in the UK with the virus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Giddens/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Behind the allegations and the noise this week are some simple truths.

In his strongest attack for months on the prime minister’s handling of the pandemic, Starmer says that the huge death toll in the second wave of cases from last autumn, in which more than 80,000 lives were lost, was “avoidable and unforgivable” and the result of a failure to learn lessons from the early stages of the crisis. Writing in the Observer after a week in which the PM’s former adviser, Dominic Cummings, said Johnson was unfit to lead the country and had delayed lockdowns with fatal results last year, Starmer argues that the inability to fix the contact tracing and self-isolation support systems, and lack of adequate border controls to prevent the spread of the India variant, all amounted to serious, inexcusable personal failures of leadership. As scientists warn today about the dangers of easing locking too early, Starmer says the level of incompetence and infighting within government raises doubts about whether the 21 June “big bang” release from lockdown will happen. “In the first wave we faced an unprecedented crisis. Decision making was undoubtedly difficult. Mistakes were inevitable. And the British public understand that,” he writes. “But by the summer, we knew much more about the virus. The prime minister was warned to prepare for a second wave. He did not do so. And over twice as many people died in the second wave than in the first. That was avoidable and unforgivable. “The failure to fix contact tracing and self-isolation support? Avoidable. The weak border policy which re-imported the virus? Avoidable. The delays to lockdown – not once, not twice, but three times? Avoidable. “That was a failure of leadership. A failure to take the tough decisions needed to keep people safe. That failure lies with the prime minister. It goes to the heart of his character and fitness for office. As the second wave grew, his refusal to take advice or recognise past mistakes had devastating consequences.” He adds: “We all want to unlock on 21 June but the single biggest threat to that is the government’s incompetence. With variant cases doubling in a week and scientists raising concerns, Johnson and his ministers should be relentlessly focused on reducing infections. Instead, they are distracted yet again by melodrama, civil war and covering their own backs.” On Friday, Britain recorded more than 4,000 coronavirus cases for the first time since the end of March, as the weekly total rose by 24%. Almost three-quarters of new cases were the variant first detected in India. Ministers are now examining options for a more limited reopening as they await more data and try to accelerate the vaccine programme. Professor Mark Woolhouse of Edinburgh University said: “It is clear we are in the foothills of an increase in cases. The question is how steep is the slope and how high will be its peak? In other words, will it threaten the NHS? We don’t know yet but we should learn the answer in a week or so.” Professor Adam Finn of Bristol University said that if at the end of next week there were 6,000 Covid cases and a week after that there were 12,000, then alarm bells would start to ring. “We will have to think twice about lifting restrictions because it will be clear we will be on the back of a very rapidly rising wave of infections,” said Finn. However, scientists says Britain’s successful vaccine programme could prevent rapidly rising numbers of cases being translated into large numbers of hospitalisations. “The vaccine rollout is going very well,” added Woolhouse. “However, it is now imperative that we go even faster.” Finn added: “21 June is only three weeks away, and if we find hospitalisations shooting up we will have to think very fast – or face another lockdown this summer.” An Opinium poll for the Observer found that 43% of people now support postponing of the 21 June lockdown easing, which many Tory MPs are desperate to maintain. This compares with 34% who think the easing should go ahead as planned. One in 10 back bringing the date forward. Overall, two-thirds (66%) of the public believe the government acted too slowly in responding to Covid, compared with 28% who think it did act fast enough. Opinion differs at different stages of the crisis. Some 69% think ministers did not act quickly enough with the first lockdown last March, 62% believe they were too slow with the second lockdown in the autumn, while 67% thought actions were too slow around Christmas. Despite the concerns about the June unlocking, there is still huge support for the government’s handling of the vaccine programme, with 71% of the public still approving of the supply and provision of the vaccine, compared with just 9% who disapprove. After Cummings gave evidence to MPs last week, the Conservative lead over Labour has fallen to six points from 13 a week earlier, according to Opinium. The Conservatives are on 42% (down two points) while Labour is up five at 36%.","charCount":"5114","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/tobyhelm\">Toby Helm</a>, <a href=\"profile/robinmckie\">Robin McKie</a>, <a href=\"profile/michael-savage\">Michael Savage</a>"},{"headline":"Yorkshire on back foot in Roses match, Essex beat Durham: county cricket – as it happened","standfirst":"<p>The champions Essex thrashed Durham by 195 runs in a match that included a record 19 LBWs</p>","trailText":"The champions Essex thrashed Durham by 195 runs in a match that included a record 19 LBWs","byline":"Tanya Aldred at Old Trafford","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"191966b618b1ac896cc3a02bc97e542d7d7c1621\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/191966b618b1ac896cc3a02bc97e542d7d7c1621/0_233_4260_2557/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Everything going flying for Cameron Bancroft as he is bowled by Essex’s Jamie Porter.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Everything going flying for Cameron Bancroft as he is bowled by Essex’s Jamie Porter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stu Forster/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<div id=\"block-60b28e028f086d71cc15ea3c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-05-29T18:57:15.365Z\">7.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Tanya Aldred's roundup</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>His shadow lolling out to the right, a white flannel tucked into the waistband of his trousers and his cropped hair gleaming in the sun, <strong>Lancashire</strong>’s Matt Parkinson ripped a ball into the rough. Out it fizzed, and Adam Lyth guided the ball off his hip and into the waiting hands of Luke Wells at leg slip. The first “Oh Lanky Lanky” since 2019 trilled over Old Trafford as Lyth stalked towards the dressing room.</p> <p>Seven overs later, the penultimate of the day, Saqib Mahmood hurtled in off his long, long run and pinned Tom Kohler-Cadmore in front of the stumps. Mahmood punched the air while Kohler-Cadmore slumped back off, followed shortly afterwards by a clatter that sounded very much like a bat being thumped repeatedly against a wall.</p> <p>Their frustration was understandable: Kohler-Cadmore and Lyth had batted for 38 of the 47 overs <strong>Yorkshire </strong>had to survive in the day, risking sending the masses into a stupor with their dedication and application to the task at hand: batting for the rest of Saturday and the whole of Sunday. They so nearly did it. </p> <p>It was Josh Bohannon, with the help of Danny Lamb, who had set Lancashire up for the kill, moving to the second Championship century of his career and his first Roses hundred slow-quick-slow – which was just what was needed. Wickets came as Lancashire upped the ante before the declaration, but by then the lead was 350. </p> <p>Yorkshire’s woes won’t have been helped by <strong>Northamptonshire</strong>’s progress down at Hove. With a win in touching distance, they will leapfrog Yorkshire to second place in Division Two. Despite a game second innings by <strong>Sussex</strong>, which included a hundred by Tom Haines and 95 for Ben Brown as well as five wickets for Simon Kerrigan, Northants were set just 218 to win. By stumps, they needed only 87 more with eight wickets in hand. </p> <p><strong>Essex</strong> beat <strong>Durham</strong> by 195 runs in an lbw-fest at The Riverside after Peter Siddle and Jamie Porter made mincemeat of their middle and late order. Durham lost five for 38 as the sun slipped down the sky, Alex Lees working hard for his 48. When Jack Burnham became the 19th player to be given out lbw, it was a record in an English first-class match.</p> <p>Daniel Moriarty took his fourth five-wicket haul of his short first-class career, bowling <strong>Gloucestershire</strong> into a hole at The Oval. The <strong>Surrey</strong> bowler took six for 60, and Amar Virdi three for 46, in the first innings, as Gloucestershire were bundled out for 158, with only Miles Hammond in a four-hour 77 providing any bulk to the batting. </p> <p>Following on, meanwhile, Hammond found himself at the crease sooner than he might have hoped and was unbeaten again on 38 at the close, but Gloucester are still 191 behind with just five wickets left. </p> <p>Career-best bowling from Dillon Pennington gave <strong>Worcestershire</strong> the upper hand at New Road. Pennington snaffled four for 44 in the first innings then three for 25 in the next as <strong>Derbyshire</strong> were invited to follow on and crumbled. </p> <p><strong>Leicestershire</strong> need an unlikely 303 to win against <strong>Middlesex</strong> on a turning pitch. Chris Wright had whistled through Middlesex earlier with six for 48. </p> <p>An intriguing final last day lies in wait at Edgbaston as <strong>Warwickshire</strong> and <strong>Nottinghamshire </strong>went nose to nose. Fifties for Michael Burgess and Will Rhodes inched Warwickshire to a lead of 245 by stumps.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60b286c88f088d8c3178d160\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-05-29T18:28:35.869Z\">7.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>What a final last hour that was at Old Trafford! </strong>I felt for the Yorkies, they’d battled so hard, shown such restraint - but Parky and Mahmood proved irresistible.

After a couple of years in the wilderness, this season he has rediscovered both touch and brio.

One became three as Wells, then Livingstone followed. But on Lancashire went. For a while it seemed they would try for maximum batting bonus points as Dane Vilas straight drove Steven Patterson for four, then dropped to one knee and pulled him behind square, and Bess was biffed for straight sixes, with Josh Bohannon reaching the scorers’ box high in the media centre.

Out it fizzed, and Adam Lyth guided the ball off his hip and into the waiting hands of Luke Wells at leg slip. The first “Oh Lanky Lanky” since 2019 trilled over Old Trafford as Lyth stalked towards the dressing room. Seven overs later, the penultimate of the day, Saqib Mahmood hurtled in off his long, long run and pinned Tom Kohler-Cadmore in front of the stumps. Mahmood punched the air while Kohler-Cadmore slumped back off, followed shortly afterwards by a clatter that sounded very much like a bat being thumped repeatedly against a wall. Their frustration was understandable: Kohler-Cadmore and Lyth had batted for 38 of the 47 overs Yorkshire had to survive in the day, risking sending the masses into a stupor with their dedication and application to the task at hand: batting for the rest of Saturday and the whole of Sunday. They so nearly did it. It was Josh Bohannon, with the help of Danny Lamb, who had set Lancashire up for the kill, moving to the second Championship century of his career and his first Roses hundred slow-quick-slow – which was just what was needed. Wickets came as Lancashire upped the ante before the declaration, but by then the lead was 350. Yorkshire’s woes won’t have been helped by Northamptonshire’s progress down at Hove. With a win in touching distance, they will leapfrog Yorkshire to second place in Division Two. Despite a game second innings by Sussex, which included a hundred by Tom Haines and 95 for Ben Brown as well as five wickets for Simon Kerrigan, Northants were set just 218 to win. By stumps, they needed only 87 more with eight wickets in hand. Essex beat Durham by 195 runs in an lbw-fest at The Riverside after Peter Siddle and Jamie Porter made mincemeat of their middle and late order. Durham lost five for 38 as the sun slipped down the sky, Alex Lees working hard for his 48. When Jack Burnham became the 19th player to be given out lbw, it was a record in an English first-class match. Daniel Moriarty took his fourth five-wicket haul of his short first-class career, bowling Gloucestershire into a hole at The Oval. The Surrey bowler took six for 60, and Amar Virdi three for 46, in the first innings, as Gloucestershire were bundled out for 158, with only Miles Hammond in a four-hour 77 providing any bulk to the batting. Following on, meanwhile, Hammond found himself at the crease sooner than he might have hoped and was unbeaten again on 38 at the close, but Gloucester are still 191 behind with just five wickets left. Career-best bowling from Dillon Pennington gave Worcestershire the upper hand at New Road. Pennington snaffled four for 44 in the first innings then three for 25 in the next as Derbyshire were invited to follow on and crumbled. Leicestershire need an unlikely 303 to win against Middlesex on a turning pitch. Chris Wright had whistled through Middlesex earlier with six for 48. An intriguing final last day lies in wait at Edgbaston as Warwickshire and Nottinghamshire went nose to nose. Fifties for Michael Burgess and Will Rhodes inched Warwickshire to a lead of 245 by stumps. What a final last hour that was at Old Trafford! I felt for the Yorkies, they’d battled so hard, shown such restraint - but Parky and Mahmood proved irresistible. Cracking days elsewhere, and a great win for Essex in the lbw-party at The Riverside. I’m bushed, time for a nice glass of something cold. Till tomorrow, goodnight! Essex 182 and 301 beat Durham 99 and 189 A record breaking 19 lbws in the match! And as I press send.... Parky does his trick. Third ball from the Brian Statham end, Lyth guides the ball off his hip straight into the hands of the flexible Luke Wells. The first Oh Lanky-Lanky trills across Old Trafford. Yorkshire 72-1. And another one down: Jack Burnham sticks his leg in front of Peter Siddle’s wobbler (the 19th lbw of the match) and the umpire raises a finger. Durham 155-5, the 230 required for a win gurgling down the plughole. Parky comes on at the Brian Statham End with the crowd in a stupor: time for me to write the round-up! Oh, and Warwickshire are subsiding, three wickets tumbling for 21, Chappell picking up three. At 116-4, they need to chivvy up another 100 or so runs - the current lead over Warwicks 160. Lancashire think they’ve got Lyth on 27, but the ball sprung off the pad. Gloucestershire have lost a third at The Oval, Lace for a duck. Northants are keeping their head against Sussex, though they have lost the run-chase King Vasconcelos for 38. Currently 86-2 needing another 133 to win. At The Riverside, Sam Cook has just collected another lbw - Miichael Jones for 35 - and Durham’s slipper starts to slide. 137-4, need another 248 to win. Leicestershire, set an impossible task by Middlesex, have lost Azad for 1 - 366 or a day and a bit’s batting needed. And from the Brian Statham End, Liam Livingstone just turned one square. Gloucestershire lose two wickets in six balls, a cursed breakthrough by Surrey in their second dig, Brathwaite caught and bowled by Jamie Overton for 28; Dent LBW to Abbott for 14. And Hammond finds himself back at the crease again. And at OT, Parky has taken his rightful place at the James Anderson End, a hanky hanging out of his waistband. There have been four singles in the last 91 balls.... Fantastic generosity from Lancashire, the scoreboard has given Yorkshire six points. Sun out, short shadows, Lyth 16, KC 15. “Hi Tanya. “Hello Richard Hirst “The teatime scores show close to symmetry between the Oval and Old Trafford. As a Surrey supporter from Yorkshire stock (and therefore anti-Yorkshire for cricket purposes) I’m delighted by both scores.” I wonder if symmetry in numbers appeals to everyone in the same way as symmetry in the face? Yes, the scoreboard is working at Old Trafford, its just that Yorkshire have retreated into their spiky shells. Vilas has reverted to pace with Lamb and Wood and Lyth and Kohler-Cadmore defend. Fatly pleased to see Dillon Pennington’s 4-44 in Derbyshire’s first-innings, followed by the first wicket of Derbys’s second innings. Have been waiting for him to have a breakthrough match ever since watching him against Surrey at New Road in September 2018. Group One Riverside: Durham 99 all out and 126-3 v Essex 182 all out and 301 Durham need 259 to win Edgbaston: Warwickshire 341 all out and 95-1 v Nottinghamshire 297 New Road: Worcestershire 421 all out v Derbyshire 270 and 16-1 Group Two Grace Road: Leicestershire 136 v Middlesex 295 and 204-8 The Oval: Surrey 473 all out v Gloucestershire 158 and 28-0 Group Three Old Trafford: Lancashire 509-9dec v Yorkshire 159 and 28-0. Hove: Sussex 175 and 298 v Northants 256 and 35-1 Northants need 183 to win Ah. Vilas has plumped for a bit of Livingstone for the last over before tea. Will it be the spin twins twirling and gurning throughout the final session? Lyth and Kohler-Cadmore have negotiated this first part of their second innings with aplomb. Yorkshire 28-0, Lyth 15; KC 12. Tea scores to follow. Derby following on at Worcester; Gloucestershire following on at The Oval. And Northants need another 194 to win at Hove, they’ve already lost Ben Curran for 10. Poor Curran, averaging 14 this season in his seven games. Not a bad record. By the way, Parky is on. Middlesex suffering a scuttle of wickets, losing three for five, including Handscomb for 36. Chris Wright 5-43. And Gloucestershire too are in deep trouble. Daniel Moriarty 5-56; Amar Virdi 3-46. Gloucestershire 158-9, no, make that 158 all out. Miles Hammond last man out for 77. They must gear up again, following-on, 315 behind. Durham lose a third wicket - 104-3 - a much better effort than the first innings, but too many wickets gone, too early in the day. The bowler, ten Doeschate, the batsman Lees. 281 more needed to win. Oh, Ben Brown! Sussex now 298-9, with him 95 not out - NO - make that 95 OUT! Sussex 298, five wickets for Simon Kerrigan (horray!). Northants need 217 to win. Would it be rude to suggest that laid-back Yorkshire look in no trouble at all? A fantastic rear-guard display by Sussex led by a century from Tom Haines and a nearly-ton from Ben Brown, who is 95 not out. Sussex 298-8, a lead of 216. Saqib Mahmood does a series of bouncy tuck jumps at the top of his long, long, run. That’s just showing off. OOoof, Lyth cuts, past a diving Danny Lamb at gully. A slightly risky air to that shot. Tom Bailey stands tall at the top of his run, quick and smooth. After one over, Yorkshire are 1-0 and everything suddenly has urgency and energy. This is the fourth time Lancashire have passed 500 in Roses matches and, remarkably, their second 509-9 declared . The first, I know you’ll want to know, came in 1926. 47 overs of the day left. Mahmood is run out for 0 and Lancs declare. A lovely gesture by Patterson, who shakes Bohannon’s hand and then signals to his players to let Bohannon walk back first, 127 not out, and they all clap him off. The groundsman drapes the crease in a black cloth, a funereal spectre of things to come. They’re back on at Edgbaston, Warwickshire pocketing a 44-run first-innings lead. And they’re stepping on it, at OT. Declaration not far away. Tom Bailey slams Hill into the empty seats of the party stand... oh, ... and he’s been bowled trying to whallop a repeat shot. Lancashire 506-8 Dom Bess gets a consolation wicket, Lamb for 61, but the Lancashire declaration doesn’t come. We’re not sure what they’re waiting for - 500? Another Chester-le-Street lbw - this time Scott Borthwick to Sam Cook for 29. Durham 53-2 and the pitch misbehaving. Notts all out at Edgbaston, but they’ve done well to pull themselves to within 44 of Warwickshire’s first innings. . Derbyshire have lost Hudson-Prentice for 25, Critchley hanging on for 61. Hammond still there at The Oval, on 61, but Gloucestershire are in rather a hole, now 129-7, 343 behind. And that’s the hundred! A first Roses hundred, the second first-class ton of his career, off 260 balls, ten fours and a six. He punches the air, whips off his helmet and raises his bat to his whooping teammates and, round the ground, to the clapping crowd. A cracking innings, slow, quick, quick, slow, which has taken Lancashire to an utterly dominant position. Nervous 99s for Bohannon.... And a great preview of the New Zealand series, which starts on Wednesday! No jacket required at lunch at Old Trafford. On my turn of the ground I saw a couple of 99’s gingerly making their way back to their seats, a man in an MCC blazer and matching face mask, and a good handful of children. Here are the Grahams, enjoying a family outing at OT for the first time post lockdown (though Peter has been here every day the match). Happy Birthday for Monday Kian and Zavi! Seat banging and mucho applause as Danny Lamb reaches his fifty with a single off Danny Brook. Off a 142 balls in a vital seventh-wicket partnership as Yorkshire just wait for the trials ahead. An email pops up from Andrew Benton: “Every time I see your name I connect in my head to a film called Ptang Yang Kipperbang, which was on Channel 4 soon after it started broadcasting (40-odd years ago now). I saw it then, as a lad, then forgot about it. Finally I checked it out and am reminded it’s about cricket (!) and more, with John Arlott providing a commentary on the adolescent protagonists life. Perhaps recommended viewing for non-match days (or the Hundred, if that flops!)“ Thank you Andrew! A lovely interview by Kevin Howells with Vic Marks on the radio now. Group One Riverside: Durham 99 all out and 47-1 v Essex 182 all out and 301 Edgbaston: Warwickshire 341 all out v Nottinghamshire 274-8 New Road: Worcestershire 421 all out v Derbyshire 193-5 Group Two Grace Road: Leicestershire 136 v Middlesex 295 and 125-4 The Oval: Surrey 473 all out v Gloucestershire 113-6 Group Three Old Trafford: Lancashire 439-6 v Yorkshire 159 all out Hove: Sussex 175 all out and 241-7 v Northants 256 all out And that is lunch, as a weary Yorkshire dawdle off the field. The Lancashire lead, 280. Scores to follow. Emma Lamb has reached her hundred, 107 not out, against Western Storm; Peter Handsomb and John Simpson at the crease for Middlesex, who have lost three this morning, but have a healthy padding of 284 over Leicestershire With an over to go, Bohannon needs another eight for his century, Danny Lamb ten for his fifty. Lancs 439-6. A third wicket to Simon Kerrigan at Hove- Tom Haines out for a marvellous 103. And Gloucestershire in deep trouble at The Oval! Brathwaited 38, Hammond 44 not out, but a sorry tale otherwise of noughts and ones as the spinners weave their web : three for Virdi, two for Moriarty. Hammond not out 44 and Tattersall, on loan from Yorkshire, one. And, according to the commentators, the pitch isn’t even spinning yet. If anyone is interested, these were the thoughts of Steven Patterson yesterday. Incidentally, we think that if Derbyshire make 200, Yorkshire will have the lowest number of batting points in the country. “It was an horrendous start for us (with the bat). But fair play to them, they’ve played good cricket throughout and have not let us back in the game. We now find ourselves right up against it. “I thought Keaton Jennings and Luke Wells showed us, in a sense, how to bat on a good surface. When you get the opportunity, make it count. “They didn’t score at a particularly quick rate at any stage, but they made it hard work for us and ground us down. “I can’t question the lads character and effort today. It’s a good surface and hard to get wickets on. “To go at two and a half an over for the first 120 overs is a good effort and a testament to the bowlers skills. But, at the end of the day, we can’t keep expecting the bowlers to pull us out of trouble.” Happy to see Barnard and Pennington in the wickets at New Road - Derby in a bit of pickle at 148-5. Not to worry Yorkshire, but Dom Bess is just starting to find a bit of a twist on the pitch. Notts continuing to bleed wickets, now 237-7, but Sussex are on a roll. Tom Haines 94 not out, Ben Brown 54 not out. A partnership of 96 which has given Sussex a sniff of a chance of fighting for a place in Division One. Their lead over Northants, 114. Thanks to Romeo for pointing out that I’d filed some absolute gibberish about live streams (he was a lot more polite!). I’ll try again: Some amazing live stream data: on day one of the Roses match, Lancashire picked up 159,000 hits via facebook and youtube, and 153,000 on day two. This is compared with an average of 150,000 over a four day match. Plus more watching on Sky. The Roses, it seems, still captures the imagination. Durham, I’m afraid to report, have lost their first wicket on their quest to make large number of runs to win. Cameron Bancroft bowled by Jamie Porter for four. Durham 9-1. Tim Bresnan pockets Joe Clarke for 61 as Nottinghamshire reach 218-5. Danny Lamb (23 not out) is not the only member of his family batting today, his sister Emma is 55 not out for Thunder against Western Storm. Essex’s innings has disintegrated with a familiar flow: another bowled and another lbw, both to Ben Raine, who finishes with 5-64. Durham need 385 to win, with five and a half sessions to get them. Aha. Some amazing live stream data: on day one of the Roses match, Lancashire picked up 159,000 hits, and 153,000 on day two. This is compared with an average of 150,000 over a four day match. Plus more watching on Sky. The Roses, it seems, still captures the imagination. And a gorgeous straight drive from Bohannon off Olivier, pushes Lancashire towards 400. Bohannon’s fifty came at last - 149 balls, seven fours, 1 six - he’s a real block or biff it boy. And I should probably mention, for those of you not watching the live streams, that the players are still taking regular sanitisation breaks. Notts have just lost their first wicket,Lyndon James for four, and Joe Clarke has passed his fourth fifty of the season. Notts 202-4. Here, we’re still waiting for Josh Bohannon to get the two runs to reach his fifty. Voices in the press box saying: “Bohannon for England!” A slow start here, a bit of prodding and poking with a fair scattering of members on an almost humid day. Some cracking reads in the paper today: and one that I KNOW will appeal to County Blog readers: Good morning! It’s the last Saturday in May and county cricket is in bloom everywhere. Some tight games today, results could flourish at Hove and Chester-le-Street ,while Lancashire, Surrey and Middlesex will tighten the screw. Keep an eye too on the Rachael Heyhoe Flint Trophy, which starts today. This year, its second, consists of eight-teams (Central Sparks, South East Stars, Northern Diamonds, Western Storm, Sunrisers , Thunder, Southern Vipers and Loughborough Lightening) playing in a 50-over competition. Lastly, apologies for the slight delay to the blog - the dog rolled in something disgusting. Group One Riverside: Durham 99 all out v Essex 182 all out and 263-8 Edgbaston: Warwickshire 341 all out v Nottinghamshire 173-3 New Road: Worcestershire 421 all out v Derbyshire 91-3 Group Two Grace Road: Leicestershire 136 v Middlesex 295 and 57-1 The Oval: Surrey 473 all out v Gloucestershire 45-1 Group Three Old Trafford: Lancashire 350-6 v Yorkshire 159 all out Hove: Sussex 175 all out and 142-4 v Northants 256 all out On a traditionally overcast Roses Friday, the day meandered towards a crushing Lancashire lead. Keaton Jennings was the master builder, crafting his first red-ball century since he made 146 not out for England against Sri Lanka in November 2018. After a couple of years in the wilderness, this season he has rediscovered both touch and brio. Away he chugged, putting on 19 runs in the first 45 minutes with Luke Wells, but there were occasional boulders as well as bricks, as skimming cover drives and gleaming late cuts were plucked from the level. Yorkshire plugged away, throwing on Dom Bess, his baggy trousers and shaggy hair a sharp contrast to Jennings’ ironed creases and buttoned cuffs. Yorkshire eventually got their hands on the new ball they had been after all day, and it tookonly five overs to make a breakthrough as Jennings was caught at first slip after a partnership of 175 with Wells. One became three as Wells, then Livingstone followed. But on Lancashire went. For a while it seemed they would try for maximum batting bonus points as Dane Vilas straight drove Steven Patterson for four, then dropped to one knee and pulled him behind square, and Bess was biffed for straight sixes, with Josh Bohannon reaching the scorers’ box high in the media centre. But sense soon prevailed and the grind, grind, grind returned. A sixth wicket stand of 125 between Ryan ten Doeschate (55) and Adam Wheater (81) rescued Essex from an unbecoming 53 for five to finish the day with a towering lead at Chester-le-Street. Durham were earlier bowled out for 99; such was the haste of their demise that Simon Harmer didn’t even get to wrap his bowling fingers around the ball. Saif Zaib’s 64 helped Northants to a handy first-innings lead at Hove. After a post-tea wobble, Tom Haines and Ben Brown inched Sussex ahead. Lewis Hill and Callum Parkinson were the only players to make their mark on Leicestershire’s first innings of 136. Martin Andersson was too much for their middle order, picking up four for 27, his best figures for Middlesex. Hashim Amla continued to scatter his munificence at The Oval, finishing with 173, and Surrey 473, thanks to a bit of hurry-up from Rikki Clarke and Sean Abbott. Gloucestershire must now bat out two days on a turning pitch, with Amar Virdi already in the wickets shortly before rain stopped play. A last wicket can-can of 52 for Warwickshire between Liam Norwell and Oliver Hannon-Dalby proved a morning irritation to Nottinghamshire on a day interrupted by showers.

But as they took their break – and tried to gather their thoughts – both knew that time limits on Cummings in this mood were no longer realistic, or in anyone’s interest. Before going off to their respective Commons offices for a quick sandwich – and as Johnson was being given last-minute briefings for prime minister’s questions by officials on what Cummings had said – Clark and Hunt had a short chat and agreed to let the Cummings show roll … and roll.</p> \n<p>“There was a discussion, and a decision was made that this was just too gripping, and that we had to let it run,” said a committee source. “It seemed wrong to hurry it along. It was too important.”</p> \n<p>In all, the Cummings evidence would last seven hours, until late afternoon. Throughout, with his head propped on his hands, he dropped bombshell after bombshell with dizzying regularity. Strikingly, however – for someone who had denied having done anything wrong last summer when he drove to County Durham with his wife and child when suffering Covid symptoms – Cummings opened with a very personal apology, and later even ridiculed himself as unfit to have been a prime ministerial adviser. “In any sensible, rational government, it is completely crazy that I should have been in such a senior position, in my personal opinion,” he said. “I’m not smart. I’ve not built great things in the world. It is completely crackers that someone like me should have been in there, just like it’s crackers that Boris Johnson is in there.”</p> \n<p>He also took his share of responsibility for Covid deaths that he said could have been avoided. “I would like to say to all the families of those who died unnecessarily how sorry I am for the mistake that we made and for my own mistakes.”</p> \n<p>As Cummings will have known full well, however, and as his friends pointed out in private afterwards, his mea culpas served a tactical purpose, giving his entire performance a credibility and impact it might otherwise have lacked. Without his own admissions as defences, he would have left himself wide open to ridicule, and accusations that he was merely bitter and out for revenge. “As it was, by sharing culpability he could twist in the knife with more lethal effect. He sounded fairer, more balanced,” said one Tory source who has worked with Cummings.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f0f6cf2d383201c4b98943b53f4324227ccd992b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0f6cf2d383201c4b98943b53f4324227ccd992b/0_0_2207_1324/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matt Hancock wearing a union jack face mask\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Covid patriot?

Except – and this was widely noticed in Westminster – he left his old friend Michael Gove out of the line of fire (despite describing his department as “terrifyingly shit”) and had only praise for Johnson’s likely successor, Rishi Sunak, the chancellor.</p> \n<p>Cummings’s depiction of the prime minister was, by contrast, that of a walking disaster who grossly underestimated Covid in the early part of last year, until he contracted it himself and ended up in intensive care last April.</p> \n<p>“In February, the prime minister regarded this as just a scare story, he described it as the new swine flu,” Cummings told the committee. Johnson, he said, was an awful leader in a crisis, one who blundered from one wrong decision to another, guided more by media pressure than evidence or serious thought.</p> \n<p>As a result, lockdowns were delayed in spring and autumn with fatal effects. “No one could find a way around the problem of the prime minister [being] just like a shopping trolley smashing from one side of the aisle to the other,” was the analogy Cummings planted in people’s minds.</p> \n<p>Johnson had also fired off several typically unguarded, insensitive remarks, Cummings said, such as that the virus was only killing people over 80, that he would rather “let the bodies pile high” than impose another lockdown last autumn, and that he should have acted like the mayor in the film <em>Jaws</em> and kept things open rather than shut them down.</p> \n<p>But it was Hancock – who tried all last week to combat Cummings’s assaults by casting himself as a great Covid patriot (he wore an England football shirt when out running and a union jack mask when hounded by the press) – who Cummings seemed most determined to bully and ultimately destroy. “I think the secretary of state for health should’ve been fired for at least 15, 20 things, including lying to everybody on multiple occasions in meeting after meeting in the cabinet room and publicly,” he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"d603fa85-cfa4-4218-b5ce-0f1358b50db2\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/84zgreARFpY?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The most incendiary allegation, denied by Hancock, was that the health secretary had told the prime minister and others that people would be tested for Covid-19 before leaving hospitals and moved to care homes, early on in the pandemic.</p> \n<p>“Hancock told us in the cabinet room that people were going to be tested before they went back to care homes. What the hell happened?” Cummings said, before adding: “We were told categorically in March that people would be tested before they went back to care homes. We only subsequently found out that that had not happened. Now, all the government rhetoric was ‘we have put a shield around care homes’ and blah, blah, blah. It was complete nonsense. Quite the opposite of putting a shield around them, we sent people with Covid back to the care homes.”</p> \n<p>The next day, as Hancock was summoned to parliament to answer an urgent question from Labour on the Cummings accusations, MPs seemed disoriented. Several noted the way attitudes to Cummings had changed overnight on their own sides – both Tory and Labour. They had become inverted. Suddenly Conservatives who had gone out of their way to defend him over his trips to Durham and Barnard Castle last year now had an interest in portraying him as a bitter and twisted liar. At the same time, Labour MPs who had painted him as the ultimate hypocrite less than 12 months ago were using his word as gospel.</p> \n<p>The ironies were highlighted by the Tory MP William Wragg in a mischievous question to Hancock. “It must be personally difficult for him and others who needlessly defended someone so willing to throw them into the road – presumably a road full of those behind the wheel testing their eyesight. But is not the greater irony the strange epiphany in many who have gone from regarding the prime minister’s former adviser as a latter-day King Herod whose words and deeds could not be trusted, to regarding him as a prophet who, fresh from the wilderness, brings with him supposed truths written on tablets of stone? Irony of ironies, all is irony.”</p> \n<p>Hancock, meanwhile, opted for the Churchillian approach, not even mentioning Cummings once by name from the dispatch box and giving the deliberate impression that the day before had never happened. “I am proud of everyone in my department,” he said. “Whether it is the science, the NHS or the people queueing for vaccines in their droves, Britain is rising to this challenge. We have come together as one nation, and we will overcome.”</p> \n<p>Four days on from Cummings’s appearance, one question MPs are asking is what difference, if any, his blitzkrieg on the government and prime minister he used to serve will make. Labour senses a chance. Labour leader Keir Starmer, writing in the <em>Observer</em>, says the government’s incompetence and failure to learn the lessons from its previous mistakes is the “single biggest threat” to plans to end most restrictions on 21 June.</p> \n<p>The Conservatives’ sense of invincibility after the local elections on 6 May has been punctured. As one former Tory minister put it, Cummings has created real and immediate problems for Johnson.</p> \n<p>“Cummings has left Boris with a real dilemma now over unlocking on 21 June. If he does and we have another spike in cases, it will suggest he has blundered again. If he delays, he will be in huge trouble with our MPs. There will also be big questions about whether we should bring forward the public inquiry after what Cummings said. The pressure is very much on us again.”</p> \n<p>Of all the excoriating claims made by Cummings, it was the one about Hancock claiming hospital patients would be tested before they were returned to care homes that could be most serious.</p> \n<p>Hancock has already conceded that some residents were returned to homes without tests, but says he never stated that all would be tested. He says that he promised tests for all residents discharged from hospital as soon as testing capacity allowed.</p> \n<p>The second big question MPs are asking is what more Cummings has in his locker: what, if any, killer evidence he might produce. Hunt and Clark are writing to Cummings in the next few days to demand that he produce what evidence he has to back his claims, and they want to see it before Hancock appears before the committee in 11 days’ time. At the same time, they will insist that Hancock agrees to an open-ended sitting, staying for as long as MPs have questions, as happened with Cummings.</p> \n<p>Allies of Cummings have previously suggested he has contemporaneous notes and even recordings of some key meetings. A lot also hangs on the truth about a key meeting in May last year, when the prime minister is said to have quizzed Hancock about his response to care homes and testing. Hancock’s allies have said they do not recognise reports of such a meeting.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/may/29/we-faced-an-unprecedented-crisis-but-tens-of-thousands-of-second-wave-covid-deaths-were-avoidable-and-unforgivable\">We faced an unprecedented crisis, but tens of thousands of second wave Covid deaths were avoidable – and unforgivable</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Major care home providers are now demanding to know the truth.

The ironies were highlighted by the Tory MP William Wragg in a mischievous question to Hancock. “It must be personally difficult for him and others who needlessly defended someone so willing to throw them into the road – presumably a road full of those behind the wheel testing their eyesight. But is not the greater irony the strange epiphany in many who have gone from regarding the prime minister’s former adviser as a latter-day King Herod whose words and deeds could not be trusted, to regarding him as a prophet who, fresh from the wilderness, brings with him supposed truths written on tablets of stone? Irony of ironies, all is irony.” Hancock, meanwhile, opted for the Churchillian approach, not even mentioning Cummings once by name from the dispatch box and giving the deliberate impression that the day before had never happened. “I am proud of everyone in my department,” he said. “Whether it is the science, the NHS or the people queueing for vaccines in their droves, Britain is rising to this challenge. We have come together as one nation, and we will overcome.” Four days on from Cummings’s appearance, one question MPs are asking is what difference, if any, his blitzkrieg on the government and prime minister he used to serve will make. Labour senses a chance. Labour leader Keir Starmer, writing in the Observer, says the government’s incompetence and failure to learn the lessons from its previous mistakes is the “single biggest threat” to plans to end most restrictions on 21 June. The Conservatives’ sense of invincibility after the local elections on 6 May has been punctured. As one former Tory minister put it, Cummings has created real and immediate problems for Johnson. “Cummings has left Boris with a real dilemma now over unlocking on 21 June. If he does and we have another spike in cases, it will suggest he has blundered again. If he delays, he will be in huge trouble with our MPs. There will also be big questions about whether we should bring forward the public inquiry after what Cummings said. The pressure is very much on us again.” Of all the excoriating claims made by Cummings, it was the one about Hancock claiming hospital patients would be tested before they were returned to care homes that could be most serious. Hancock has already conceded that some residents were returned to homes without tests, but says he never stated that all would be tested. He says that he promised tests for all residents discharged from hospital as soon as testing capacity allowed. The second big question MPs are asking is what more Cummings has in his locker: what, if any, killer evidence he might produce. Hunt and Clark are writing to Cummings in the next few days to demand that he produce what evidence he has to back his claims, and they want to see it before Hancock appears before the committee in 11 days’ time. At the same time, they will insist that Hancock agrees to an open-ended sitting, staying for as long as MPs have questions, as happened with Cummings. Allies of Cummings have previously suggested he has contemporaneous notes and even recordings of some key meetings. A lot also hangs on the truth about a key meeting in May last year, when the prime minister is said to have quizzed Hancock about his response to care homes and testing. Hancock’s allies have said they do not recognise reports of such a meeting. Major care home providers are now demanding to know the truth. The Observer has been told that they met Department of Health officials on 12 March and warned them that no untested transfers should be made from hospital. By 2 April, the official advice was that untested transfers could still go ahead. This weekend, many Tory MPs are still bemused, uncertain what the repercussions will be for Johnson, Hancock, the government and their party. Most believe Hancock is damaged but on the other hand they know it will now be more difficult for the prime minister to move him or sack him soon, as if he does it would appear to vindicate the Cummings view. As for Johnson, the man who did more than any other unelected figure to deliver Brexit for him and then won him a general election and an 80-plus Commons majority has served notice, in seven hours of evidence, that he is after him. “Boris knows more than anyone that Cummings is a winner,” said a former Tory minister who knows Johnson and Cummings well. “That is why he took him on and that is what will frighten him now. What will Cummings do next? We don’t know. That is what is so terrifying.”","charCount":"12083","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/tobyhelm\">Toby Helm</a> and <a href=\"profile/michael-savage\">Michael Savage</a>"},{"headline":"Thomas Frank hopes Brentford’s promotion helps other clubs to dream","standfirst":"<ul><li>Frank says club’s journey ‘is absolutely unbelievable’</li><li>Swansea manager Cooper says defeat can galvanise club</li></ul>","trailText":"Thomas Frank said Brentford’s journey to the Premier League ‘is absolutely unbelievable’ while Swansea’s manager Steve Cooper says defeat can galvanise the club","byline":"Ben Fisher at Wembley","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f72680319b781ce17ff419370f768091dedf41ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f72680319b781ce17ff419370f768091dedf41ae/0_165_5041_3023/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thomas Frank says of Brentford’s 2-0 victory over Swansea at Wembley: ‘There was pressure on us to do well.’\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomas Frank says of Brentford’s 2-0 victory over Swansea at Wembley: ‘There was pressure on us to do well.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Marsh/BPI/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Thomas Frank said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/may/29/brentford-promoted-to-premier-league-after-stinging-swansea-championship-play-off-final-report\" title=\"\">Brentford’s fairytale promotion to the Premier League</a> should encourage clubs across the world to dare to dream, after they returned to the top flight for the first time in 74 years.

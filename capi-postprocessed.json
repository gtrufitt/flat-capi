Oh dear. He then nets again, but fights back well for 30-all ... before Medvedev nails a forehand down the line ... and Garin does likewise with a backhand. That takes us to a succession of deuces, during which we even see Medvedev at the net – he can’t return Garin’s pass – and after which we see Medevev nail two monstrous forehand winners down the line and on the run when sent to chase wide ones. Wow! They give him the break, and after a sit-down he’ll serve for the match. Garin is playing much better now, and with Medvedev serving at 4-5 he works his to 30-all. So Medvedev sends down a service winner followed by an ace, as you do, and lumps the pressure back on his opponent. I’d not be surprised to see him break next game. Thanks John and hi again. Looking at the draw, I see that the winner of this match plays Tsitsipas next; that’a a strange seed 2 v seed 5 unwinding of the draw; Nadal, seeded 3, will play Schwartzman, seeded 10, if both win their last 16 matches. Ok, Daniel will resume duties with Garin leading 4-3 in the third set, two sets down to Medvedev. We are back at 3-3 as Medvedev recovers himself, and now to try and break Garin’s serve. The Russian looks fluid and confident once more, having had a slight wobble. Powerful serving, and then some crashing ground strokes get the job done. That was hugely impressive against an opponent who threw everything at it. There’s more life in the other men’s game, with Garin 3-1 up on Medvedev in the the third set. Tsitsipas holds for 5-5, claiming the game with an ace. And so it’s Carreno Busta who enters sudden death mode. Tsitsipas goes to 30-15 up, and then an error from the Spaniard grants him two break points. Then another, and it’s 6-5, and he will serve for the match. Here’s the latest on Roger Federer. Tsitsipas fails to break, and will have to serve to stay in the third set. It’s 5-4 to Carreno Busta. It’s at 4-4 between Stefanos Tsitsipas and Pablo Carreño Busta. This could be done in three sets, with the momentum very much with Tsitsipas. Needless to say, Medvedev took the second set 6-1 on Garin. He’s cruising through, and not the lack of effort from his opponent. Carreno Busta was 4-1 up and a break up, but Tsitsipas hits back and it goes to 3-4, with the Greek to serve. Here’s the reasons for Federer’s withdrawal. Hopefully he will be OK for another shot at SW19. “After discussions with my team, I’ve decided I will need to pull out of the French Open today. After two knee surgeries and over a year of rehabilitation it’s important that I listen to my body and make sure I don’t push myself too quickly on my road to recovery. I am thrilled to have gotten 3 matches under my belt. There is no greater feeling than being back on court”, said Federer. Tournament Director, Guy Forget said: “The Roland-Garros tournament is sorry about the withdrawal of Roger Federer, who put up an incredible fight last night. We were all delighted to see Roger back in Paris, where he played three high-level matches. We wish him all the best for the rest of the season.” He’s won three matches but his knee was troubling him. Wimbledon and Tokyo are the aim for this year after all. Medvedev in full control, and 5-0 up on Garin, who has put on a white cap, as if to give himself luck, and it seems to work. He’s still 5-1 down, and Medvedev can serve for the second set. Medvedev seems well in charge on Garin though is meeting resistance at 3-0 up in the second set. He has two break points, and Garin is being sent all round the court. Still, he saves them but then Medvedev’s power brings it back to deuce. Then the Russian goes long on a service return, and then a skidding pass follows a Garin drop shot. A superb shot leaves the Chilean swinging at fresh air. Garin though pulls off the drop shot this time around, with added slice. Then a winning shot goes wide of the line, and the umpire is out of his seat to show how far he was out - it wasn’t by much. This is a monstrously long game. Garin desperate to hold his serve but he is being put through the wringer. And finally he succumbs - it’s 4-0 in the second set and Medvedev looking confident. Carreno Busta grabs a break, and he’s 2-0 up in the third on Tsitsipas. Game on! Good afternoon, everyone. Carreno Busta is still fighting hard despite his deficit, but Tsitsipas takes him to deuce on his opening service game. Some good play at the net, two crashing smashes means he holds. And with that, I’m off for some dinner; John Brewin will guide you through the next hour. Well, Carreno Busta gets himself 30-40 with Tsitsipas serving for the set and looks well in the rally, until a forehand out wide followed by one down the line to the other corner facilitate the simple put-away. I’ve not seen many players who you see behind in a rally but know will find a way to turn it around – Tsitsipas just has so many weapons, and when Carreno Busta can only bump a serve out wide over the net, he’s already on his way back to his seat when it’s knocked into the open court. Tsitsipas 6-3 6-2 Carreno Busta Two huge backhands cross-court – Garin expected the second to be up the middle or down the line - raises set point for Medvedev, and a double fault hands it to him. He’s played pretty well, and looks in total control. Garin 2-6 Medvedev This must be really painful for Carreno Busta: everything he does well, Tsitsipas does better, and everything he does badly, Tsitsipas does well. But he does really well to win his first game in seven, a fine drop and a fine get the highlights. It’s now 4-1 Tsitsipas in set two, while on Lenglen, Medvedev has consolidated for 4-2. Successive booming forehands give Medvedev the first break point of the match, and when one of Garin’s loops wide of close to the frame, that’s enough to convert it. He leads 3-1 while Carreno Busta just can’t find a way past Tistsipas, who’s now won four games straight and leads 3-0 in the second, two breaks to the good. Meanwhile, Medvedev holds well for 2-1 against Garin; they’re getting warm. Goodness me, break point-down, Carreno Busta hammers a serve that forces Tsitsipas out wide ... so he simply uses the angle to fetch a wondrous forehand return cross-court. He is a player. Tsitsipas slices an ace down the T to win a first set that yielded just one break but which made clear his superiority. Tsitsipas 6-3 Carreno Busta Carreno Busta holds for 3-5 but he’s shown no signs of breaking; Tsitsipas is just too good for him. Meantime, Medvedev finds an ace on deuce then closes out for 1-0. If he didn’t know it before, he now knows he’s in a match. Garin and Medvedev are away, and this should be a decent little go-around, Garin the better clay-court player but Medvedev the better player. I think the number two seed will have enough, but if he’s off it he’ll lose. I can’t think of many players who blend touch, power, athleticism and cool with the natural ease of Tsitsipas – if he can start winning majors, he could be the star that tennis needs as the older generation move over the top (but not yet). Carreno Busta survives a near break to make 4-2, while Garin and Medvedev are out warming up. It’s easy to pigeon-hole Carreno Busta as the archetypal Spanish clay-courter, but it wasn’t until he moved to Barcelona aged 15 that he really played on the surface, and his best performances have been on hard. At the moment, he’s not got loads for Tsitsipas – who’s just produced a lush backhand pick-up winner – and trails 1-4. Tsitsipas has broken Carreno Busta at the first time of asking to lead 2-0 in their first set. Badosa loves playing on clay and tells the crowd she likes Paris and France. More news as I get it. Next on Chatrier: Garin [22] v Medvedev [2] What a brilliant win that is! She clamps a hand over her mouth in amazement despite playing like it was her right, and an eminently winnable match against Zidansek is her reward. But she’s more than ready for the last eight, raising two match points! Tell you what: based on what I’ve seen over the last eight days, Iga Swiatek looks a very good bet to retain her title – unless Serena has one of her days, it’s really hard to see who beats her. Badosa, for example, is third-favourite, but though she’s a talent – she now needs just one more hold to progress – she doesn’t look ready. Tsitsipas and Carreno Busta are underway.... Vondrousova struggles through a hold, via various deuces, for 4-2. Badosa remains two holds away from the quarters, but a lot of tightness could come between them and her. On Chatrier, Tsitsipas and Carreno Busta are walking out for what should be a decent match: the superstar quality of the former versus the clay-court specialism of the latter. This time Badosa consolidates – and comfortably. She’s looking good for the last eight. Ah, it’s like that, is it? In no time at all, Badosa has three break points and only needs one, Vondrousova banging a forehand cross-court wide. Vondrousova 4-6 6-3 1-3 Badosa Vondrousova gives Badosa plenty as she looks to consolidate, earning deuce with a colossal forehand then, on advantage, down comes a double. That’s the first time we’ve seen the Spaniard wilt under pressure, and we’re back on serve in the decider. Badosa forces a break point but Vondrousova is equal to it, clumping a forehand winner down the line. Next time, though, she can only muster a double, and Badosa leads the decider 2-0. Next on Chatrier: Tsitsipas [5] v Carreno Busta [12] Azarenka didn’t play all that well but that’s still a great win for Pavlyuchenkova, who equals her best-ever Slam performance. She meets Serena or Rybakina next. This has accelerated quickly; Pavlyuchenkova now has three match points... Suddenly Pavlyuchenkova is nearly there! She plays a terrific game to break again, a cross-court forehand winner sealing the deal, and in 90 seconds she’ll serve for the last eight. Angry Azarenka is best Azarenka and she quickly raises a break-back point only to miss her backhand return – a significant oversight – and one compounded by one into the net that hands Pavlyuchenkova advantage. A squeal follows, and seconds later the gap is two games at 4-2 while, on Lenglen, Vondrousova has taken the second set. Now then. Azarenkafinds herself with a break point which she tamely spurns, then minutes later is facing two and pulls a forehand into the net. Pavlyuchenkova leads the decider 3-2 with a breakl, while Vondrousova has consolidated to 5-2 in set two. Badosa is so good under pressure, which is to say that on those occasions, she does pretty much what she always does. She saved a couple of break pints in her previous service game and powers through three more here ... but you can only outrun opportunity for so long, and Vondrousova’s forehand gives her 4-2 in set two. I really like the look of Badosa, who has weapons and moxie; she trusts her forehand to extricate her from a break point-down situation, then unfurls a lovely backhand for advantage and quickly closes out. Girl can play. We’re on serve in both our matches currently, Badosa leading VondRoursova 6-4 1-2 with Azarenka and Pavlyuchenkova 1-1 in their decider. Dearie me; Azarenka fights back from 40-0 to 40-30, steps in to face a second serve, then well in the rally whacks a backhand long. But that works nicely for us because we now get to enjoy a decider. Azarenka 7-5 3-6 Pavlyuchenkova Badosa, meanwhile, saves two break-back points in fine style – she runs onto the ball beautifully and addresses it with power before clinching the set with a lob. Excellent work from her – she looks comfortably the superior player now. Azarenka plays a miserable game to hand Pavlyuchenkova three break points and she saves two really well ... but a very tight double ruins her good work; Pavlyuchenkova will now serve for the second set. Azarenka gets to 30-all in Pavlyuchenkova’s next service game but a pair of decent first serves snuff her out. Meanwhile, Badosa is well on top now, and at 15-40 Vondrousova hauls a forehand wide so that she’ll now serve for the first set at at 5-4. “After last night’s match, Federer said he wasn’t sure if he would play his fourth round match against Berrettini,” emails James Ferguson, “citing the fact that there is not a week off in between the French Open and Halle, where he has committed to playing. Following his lead, do you reckon I can get away with emailing my Swiss boss for a week off before our next big meeting?” I’m not sure a week is sufficient to ensure adequate preparation. Badosa is getting the measure of Vondrousova now, picking her drops and such – they’re at 3-3 – while Azarenka has recorded the fourth straight break in her match with Pavlyuchenkova so now trails 2-3 having won set one. And the Azerbaijan land of fire GP: Also going on: the final day of England v New Zealand which might just yield a positive result. Badosa breaks back immediately with the help of a double fault, while Pavlyuchenkova has broken Azarenka again to nudge in front in set two. Vondrousova’s composure is working better than Badosa’s power, and she’s just broken for 3-1. Excellent from Pavlyuchenkova, who breaks immediately in set two ... then finds herself playing deuce as she tries to consolidate. A banging forehand down the line gives Azarenka a chance to resolve things, and a really tame backhand hands her the game. Azarenka 7-5 1-2 Pavlyuchenkova A lot of people are high on Badosa, and I can’t wait to see how she does against the wily lefty behaviour of Vondrousova. Vondrousova 1-0 Badosa Azarenka is struggling here, Pavlyuchenkova sticking away at backhand at the net for a break-back point ... only to net a backhand return. But she quickly arranges another opportunity ... then spurns it, and Azarenka punishes her, upping the aggression to clinch the set principally via forehand. Azarenka 7-5 Pavlyuchenkova And there it is: Paylyuchenkova spurns various game points then tamely nets a backhand, giving Azarenka a third break of the set. She’ll serve for it in 90 while, on Lenglen, Vondrousova and Badosa are out for what should be a decent tear-up. Great news. I absolutely love Halep, and can’t wait to see her play again – we’ve missed her here. Azarenka holds easily for 5-5, and I’d not be surprised to see her break in the next game. Pavlyuchenkova started this match playing pretty much as well as she can and will be perturbed to have nothing to show for it. Still, though Azarenka has improved since then, she’ll now serve to stay in the set. Azarenka 4-5 Pavlyuchenkova Wikipedia informs me that Badosa’s favorite shot is the serve. Lovely stuff. On Chatrier, they’ve swapped breaks again; Azarenka is serving at 3-4 down. Next on Lenglen, it’s that match I mentioned below; will power and aggression of Badosa be too much for the canny, skilful Vondrousova? That’s a brilliant win and performance from Zidansek, who reaches her first Grand Slam quarter. She hung tough when she need to, then opened her shoulders at the key moments; if she keeps it up, she’ll have plenty for whichever of Vondrousova [20] or Badosa [33] she meets next. Zidansek goes wide with a forehand down the line, handing Cirstea a point to claw back one of her two breaks; again, she finds a really good serve that allows her to make deuce, and seconds later she has her first match point.... Azarenka breaks back and is starting to hum; behold Pavlyuchenkova’s behind-ear tatt. On Lenglen, Cirstea has struggled through a hold, forcing Zidansek to serve for it at 5-1. Pavlyuchenkova now leads Azarenka by a break, 3-1, while Zidansek powers through a hold that includes her first ace of a match that doesn’t have long left. At 0-5, Cirstea will now serve to stay in the competition. Zidansek has hit a vein at precisely the right time, and from 40-15 she works a point for a double break, thanks in part to a double on deuce; she takes it, and suddenly this match is nearly over. Zidansek 7-6(5) 4-0 Cirstea On Chatrier, Azarenka and Pavlyuchenkova have swapped breaks in their first two games while back on Lenglen, Zidansek does indeed get her break; she arranges three opportunities and takes the second, a lovely backhand down the line sealing the deal. Cirstea is in trouble. Zidansek 7-6(5) 2-0 Cirstea A loopy forehand drops long and suddenly, from 30-0, Zidansek is 30-40 – a terrific serve out wide quickly draws her level again, but Cirstea unloads some vicious forehands to earn a second break point; Zidansek saves it and then another before closing out. She’s played the big points well and that’s why she’s in front; I’d not be surprised to see her break in the next game. Zidansek 7-6(5) 1-0 Cirstea Again it’s Zidansek with the mini-break and at 3-5, Cirstea doesn’t have long to resolve it ... and she has even less time now, racing to the net, but when the ball’s banged at her she can only deflect it wide. Three set points it is, and though Cirstea saves the first with yet another winner, she then sends a forehand wide. That’s a tough set to lose because she was the better player; other hand, she’ll feel confident she’s got the game to win form here. Zidansek 7-6(5) Cirstea Cirstea seems to be hitting it a bit harder than Zidansek, on a regular and on special occasions, a barrage of blows – the last of them a sensational forehand cross-court on the run – putting her in front. Before the match I fancied Zidansek, but that power differential is significant – for as long as Cirstea’s radar is operational. And there we go – she bangs a forehand down the line but catches the ball a little late, wiping it just wide. But she retrieves the mini-break immediately with some lovely hands and balance at the net. Zidansek 6(3)-(3)6 Cirstea Cirstea gets 0-15 and will be vexed that she then nets a forehand return that drops into the slot. But she makes Zidansek play a low backhand right on the baseline that falls long, and the aroma of opportunity will be wafting through her nostrils. Zidansek, though, is having no such thing, her lateral movement on-point and facilitating a forehand winner punished down the line for 40-30. She can’t close out though, and Cirstea saves a succession of game-points on advantage before another backhand winner - there’ve been a few – raises her first set-point. Zidansek, though, delivers a gorgeous, nerveless forehand winner down the line – then another – and this is developing into a really good tussle. A big service winner down the middle, and we’ve got that breaker. Zidansek 6-6 Cirstea Excellent from Zidansek, rattling through an easy hold, but then Cirstea does likewise and we might be just moving to that elusive point of both players playing well at the same time; if Zidansek can muster one more hold, we’ll get to examine that premise in a breaker. Zidansek 5-6 Cirstea Cirstea holds to 30 – Zidansek is getting closer – but in 90 seconds she’ll serve under pressure, and who knows how that’ll pan out? Zidansek 4-5 Cirstea Looking down the rest of the day’s play, Tsitsipas v Carreno Busta stands out – as does any match featuring the Greek musketeer – but Azarenka v Pavlyuchenvoka and Serena v Rybakina could also be good. Zidansek and Cirstea are at different stages of their careers, the former 23 and the latter 31. But they’re a really good match for each other based on what we’ve seen so far, with Cirstea looking to have settled faster – she’s hitting beautifully from the back and showing decent enterprise at the net. Zidansek 3-4 Cirstea Chatrier Azarenka [15] v Pavlyuchenkova [31] Tsitsipas [5] v Carreno Busta [12] Williams S v Rybakina [21] Zverev [6] v Nishikori (night match) ** Lenglen Zidansek v Cirstea Vondrousova [20] v Badosa Garin [22] v Medvedev [2] Davidovich Fokina v Delbonnis Tamara Zidansek and Sorana Cirstea – both unseeded – swapped breaks in the first two games of their fourth-round match before Cirstea held.

We’re back, though draws hang heavy in the air. An end of term feel to the press box, time to discuss the sprightliness of Bob Appleyard well into his nineties and whether it is possible to remove the chocolate off a Leibniz biscuit in one bite. Chelmsford: Essex 210 DRAW WITH Nottinghamshire 293 and 44-2 Taunton: Somerset 360 and 409-7 v Hampshire 311 and 88-2 Canterbury: Kent 330-5dec v Northants 392 and 155-8 Headingley: Yorkshire 558 v Sussex 313 and 164-4 The new ball doth blow, and Travis Head drives to Tom Kohler-Cadmore at first slip who clings to a quick ‘un. Is there life in the old dog yet? Sussex 164-4. “Dear Tanya,” writes DaddyPig “Someone behind us just offered the opinion that “it’s not great to watch, is it ?”. After a year of not being here to watch it, and two sides giving their all, on a pitch that’s batter-friendly as long as you concentrate like fury... I think it is good to watch. Especially as I’ve a pork pie for the tea interval.” I think it is one of those games you have to utterly relax into. If you start thinking about that pin-board you should be putting up at home, you will find yourself dancing with very itchy feet. Particularly if you haven’t a pork pie (or equivalent). The new ball swishes along to the boundary after one-legged hop- drive by Thomason off Coad. A last throw of the dice here at Headingley - and Ben Coad takes the new ball, with 39 overs left. Notts 293 and 44-2 draw with Essex 210. Essex 11 points, Notts 12. Bad light and rain meant it is officially curtains at Chelmsford. The top four in Group one are separated by only nine points, with Essex in trouble because they have played an extra game. It is raining at Chelmsford, with Notts 44-2. Hampshire plough on, 80-2, Alsop and Northeast holding off Lewis Gregory et al. Northants are seven down now, Taylor caught of Gilchrist for 12, Rossington still there on 31. The lead is 201, which Kent will consider tasty. My favourite part of this absolute cock-up is Steven’s little jig of delight at the end: Wicket-tastic! just after we were discussing how Orr had played barely a false-shot, he is bowled by Dom Bess. A smashing innings, beautifully poised, resolute in defence but prepared to whack the short ball. Even more importantly, he used up 216 balls. Travis Head strides out, which for most of this season has had an unhappy outcome. He is greeted with a ball from Bess that spittles past the bat. Well, well. Sussex 125-3 with 49 overs left. While at Canterbury, Daniel Bell-Drummond runs out Procter. Northants 128-6. Rossington and Procter are speeding things up a little at Canterbury, but at 124-5, Northants only have a lead of 186. Unlike Lancashire’s long-legged slips cordon, Harry Duke and Adam Lyth (second slip) cut diminutive figures, lorded over by Tom Kohler-Cadmore at first slip. The two current bowlers, Thompson, hair held back with a headband, and David Willey, are both proud owners of a Darren-Gough approved bowler’s backside. Sussex 117-2. Defence ahoy. Another wicket at Chelmsford, as Ben Duckett’s stumps are rearranged by Shane Snater for 16. Notts 41-2, Harmer has bowled ten empty overs. This CANNOT be 27 years ago. From the Headingley trenches, a message arrives, “Hello Tanya from my son and me in the North East Lower. Much as I admire Kane Williamson’s flighty declaration at Lords, it isn’t as if there’s anything important at stake, like a top two place in a County Championship group. Meanwhile, I think there’s life in the game here, with a second new ball due before tea.” Tim, if this happens, or doesn’t happen, the jinx lies with you. Forgive me. Ian Holland’s stumps are arranged by Lewis Gregory for 9. Hampshire 39-2. It was Lewis Gregory who got the pre-prandial wicket at Taunton: Steel lbw for 14. Holland and Alsop the batsmen in possession. I can’t help think Somerset delayed their declaration a little too long - without Coverton and Leach their bowling doesn’t have such a here-we-go-on-a-roll feel to it. Hampshire 38-1 Over in the RHF trophy, Thunder are chasing 260 against Lightning for consecutive wins. Someone has ripped up the Northants script. Zaib wafts and is caught behind for six. Northants 73-5. Sainsbury’s sandwich section was dominated by cricket fans, who picked over the selection with surprising disdain. The sun pops her head through the clouds and out come the players. Very sporting and surprisingly bold. England need 273 in 75 overs Time for a dawdle down the Headingley streets to buy some lunch. Back in 40 minutes to see if Somerset and Yorkshire can whistle up a win, Essex can find the magic formula at Chelmsford and Kent and Northants can contrive something out of nothing. Chelmsford: Essex 210 v Nottinghamshire 293 and 23-1 Taunton: Somerset 360 and 409-7 v Hampshire 311 and 30-1 Canterbury: Kent 330-5dec v Northants 393 and 70-4 Headingley: Yorkshire 558 v Sussex 313 and 105-2 And at 12.58, Steve Patterson persuades the umpires to change the ball and they swap it for another, 53 overs new. Does anyone know how it works - the umpires can’t possibly have a ball for every eventuality. They can’t have 79 balls in their store-cupboard? Northants, Northants! Currently 60-4, with two for Stevens, one for Gilchrist and one for Cummins. A lead of just 123 over Kent, but Saif Zaib, who has had a smashing little season, at the crease. I didn’t realise prawn cocktail was back in vogue! My mum’s go-to starter for a 1980s dinner party. The rain forces an early lunch at Lord’s. The clouds remain high above Headingley and Sussex reach their hundred, with just two wickets lost this morning. Sussex will be quietly pleased with their morning’s work, with ten minutes till lunch. A breakthrough at Chelmsford! It be Peter Siddle, with Compton gone for 8. And an email whisks through the air from Romeo: “Hampshire need 459 to win. I wonder what the highest chase total set has been in CC history?” A quick google seems to suggest that the record remains with Middlesex, who chased 472 to beat Yorkshire by seven wickets in May 2014, with Chris Rogers unbeaten on 241. At last! Bartlett gets his hundred, Somerset pass 400 and Hampshire have a challenge. Hampshire need 459 to win. Here, 20 year old Ali Orr nestles to his fifty! With a pull down to fine leg , another Sussex half century on debut Paul Edwards tells me that since August 1 last year, Sussex have given first-class debuts to nine players in 13 games. To compare, in the BWT, Lancashire gave first-class debuts to six players. Siddle and Sam Cook with the new ball at Chelmsford; Compton and Slater just have to bat it out for some plump points for a draw. Michael Duggan asks the question: “Really don’t understand why Somerset haven’t declared – over 400 ahead on the final day. Any thoughts? Might be waiting for Bartlett to get 100 but seems very strange to jeopardise your chance of winning the match.” We were just mulling that over in the Headingley press box. Equally puzzled. They must really rate the Hampshire batting line-up, I guess. Some great livestream stats for the RHF trophy. Add the 589,000 youtube and facebook views for the Roses match last week, and a lot of people are watching a lot of cricket. Now then. So Essex are all out for 210, trailing Notts by 293. If this was last year, you’d put money on Harmer to bowl Notts out for under 100. But in 2021, the Notts-up has become something of an endangered species, and Harmer has lost his cloak of invincibility. And another! With the third ball of his morning spell, Van Zyl feathers Thompson through to Duke and has to trudge, eyes firmly on the grass back to the dressing-room. A golden duck. Sussex 60-2. A top edge! A bit of extra bounce from Bess and Tom Haines sends the ball up and into the paws of Adam Lyth. The end of a partnership of 60 between the openers, Sussex 60-1. A wicket at Chelmsford! Shane Snater is lbw to Brett Hutton for his 200th first-class wicket. Essex 195-9. Sussex pottering along much untroubled here at Headingley, which will please Lancashire no end. Ben Stokes will make his boom-back at Chester-le-Street on Friday in the T20 game against Yorkshire. Did Darren Stevens read the memo? Darren Stevens doing Darren Stevens things, pincering Emilio Gay lbw for 8, Northants 14-1. Adam Lyth gets just the one over before Dom Bess is thrown the ball. A real opportunity for the scruffy scamp today, though on a pitch that didn’t much spin yesterday. Jack Carlson, who has just been given a contract extension by Sussex, did manage to extract some turn and bounce with the wickets of Malan and Ballance. What is this sorcery? Kent have declared on their overnight 330-5: which gives Northamptonshire a second innings lead of 62 runs. Some old-fashioned declaration bowling hangs in the air. Adam Lyth bowls the first ball of the day, from the Emerald Stand end. A Sunday sprinkling of spectators, Orr and Haines the men charged with steadfast blocking. Dawid Malan , who I’m reliably informed played a perfectly-judged innings yesterday, driving particularly well before being out for 199, spoke engagingly last night: “ I’ve tried to learn from my failures at Test cricket and put that into practice in four-day cricket. “Since 2019, I think my record speaks for itself in just having that fearless approach in four-day cricket and backing my technique and way of playing. Possible Test return? “I wouldn’t be here playing four-day cricket if I didn’t want to play Test cricket again. I still feel like I’ve got a hell of a lot to give. Whether I’m good enough, that’s not my decision. I just have to keep scoring runs. “Since I got dropped in the middle of 2018, I’ve gone away and done what I was told, which is score runs. Hopefully, if I keep getting big scores like this, I can put pressure on the people who make decisions. “I think I played well in that Ashes series (2017/18). That was as well as I could have played at the time. “I feel I now know my game better. Being back in the T20s and the odd ODI, I’ve learnt what I need to do to perform at that level. That’s really important. “You’re playing against bowlers you play against all the time, but Test cricket is a different mentality and there’s more scrutiny. In my last five Tests, I probably didn’t handle that as well as I could have. Hopefully I’d be in a better position now.” Chelmsford: Essex 180-7 v Nottinghamshire 293 Taunton: Somerset 360 and 323-6 v Hampshire 311 Canterbury: Kent 330-5 v Northants 393 Headingley: Yorkshire 558 v Sussex 313 and 38-0 Marnus Labuschagne’s highest score of a difficult summer, an unbeaten 63, ended county cricket’s only remaining unbeaten record as Glamorgan chased 188 to beat Lancashire by six wickets at Sophia Gardens shortly before 12.30pm on day three. The much-vaunted Australian had not previously posted a fifty in seven Championship innings in 2021. However, his eighth delivered the goods – a high tempo 72-ball knock navigating reverse swing from seamers including Saqib Mahmood. Labuschagne has been a shadow of the player who dominated county attacks in early 2019, yet here navigated a pitch Lancashire’s Alex Davies described as “substandard” at the close on Friday. He also posted 44 in the first innings. The Queenslander said: “It was nice to be out there for the winning runs. To do it the fourth innings when the ball has gone reverse, which is exciting to play against because it is something we don’t get much of in Australia in domestic cricket, was very satisfying.” Glamorgan’s second win came as they advanced from 137 for three overnight, chasing the fixture’s highest score. However, they still have an uphill task to claim a top two finish in Group Three ahead of Lancashire, Yorkshire and the other contenders, Northamptonshire. Lancashire, the leaders, had hoped to take a significant step towards the top group, but they may be only four points clear of Yorkshire at the end of this round with two still to play and Scarborough to visit next month. Dawid Malan showed his rounded class with a serene 199 for Yorkshire as they seek victory over Sussex at Headingley. They claimed a first-innings lead of 245 midway through the evening before Sussex closed on a sturdy 38 without loss. In his first four-day appearance since last August, when he scored 219 in a Bob Willis Trophy draw against Derbyshire here, the left‑hander punished an inexperienced attack to move from 103 overnight before being bowled by off-spinner Jack Carson after lunch for the second 199 of his career. Malan, who played the last of his 15 Tests in August 2018, missed out on becoming the first Yorkshire player to score double hundreds in two consecutive innings. Warwickshire went top of Group One with a 191-run win at Derbyshire, who were bowled out for 121 in their second innings. Oliver Hannon-Dalby took four for 24 to secure a fourth win. Gloucestershire’s strong position at the Group Two summit has been eroded with back-to-back defeats, this latest against Leicestershire at Grace Road. The home side won by an innings and 93 as the left-arm spinner Callum Parkinson returned career-best match figures of 10 for 108. Somerset will hope to leapfrog Gloucester with a home win over Hampshire. Half-centuries in the second innings for Steve Davies, Tom Abell and George Bartlett secured a lead of 372 and counting. Essex and Nottinghamshire, two contenders at the top of Group One, look likely to play out a draw at Chelmsford, while Durham are far from out of the equation having won at Worcestershire chasing 86. Kent, for whom Ollie Robinson scored 120, are playing out a rainy high-scoring game with Northamptonshire at Canterbury in Group Three. That is on course for a draw assuming there is no final day contrivance. Hello! It’s a sweet June morning at Headingley, though the gateman warned that there is rain in Wakefield and it is a-heading this way.

Today, all things being equal, England will draw their third consecutive Test at home for the first time since the late eighties. And though that’s mainly down to the weather, it also reflects a different approach and a greater resilience under Chris Silverwood. The Bayliss-era England might have thrown the towel in when they slipped to 140 for six; instead, Rory Burns and Ollie Robinson (with bat and ball) stalled New Zealand’s momentum to such an extent that they finished the day crawling along at two an over.</p> <p>New Zealand will resume on 62 for two, a lead of 165. With a maximum of 98 overs to bowl, they could still force victory on a pitch is becoming more uneven. But with a forecast for showers – of the meteorological rather than the middle-order kind – that looks unlikely. Madame de Stael said that one must choose in life between boredom and suffering. England politely request a boring last day.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-06-06T10:24:03.480Z\">at 11.24am BST</time></p>  </div>","wordcount":"6274","firstPublicationDate":"2021-06-06T09:04:15Z","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2021-06-06T15:19:04Z","liveBloggingNow":"true","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/p/hy2q7","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd12857fd86274c8340db029b32f5a1b30171b81/0_95_3500_2101/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","isLive":"true","bodyText":"33rd over: England 58-2 (Sibley 19, Root 2) Root gets off the mark first ball after tea, with a neat dab past third slip. That was more purposeful. The sun comes out, tentatively, like a shy kid who’s heard someone laughing in the next room. It’s going to be Tim Southee, the man most likely to move the game along. “Hey Jim on Twitter,” says Adam Roberts. “I’ll see your Brearley and Boycott and raise you a Gavaskar 1975 (36 years ago tomorrow).” Yes, stupendous stuff – though I make it 46. 32nd over: England 56-2 (Sibley 19, Root 0) Wagner runs back to his mark to try and squeeze in another over, but to no avail. And that’s tea, with the draw the hot favourite. The crowd will have more fun in the queue for a cuppa than they’ve had watching this session. In a perfect world, they would start singing “Are you a general anaesthetic in disguise?” “Give this another couple of hours,” says Geoffrey Smith, “and you’ll all be grateful for Sibley’s 54 not out at stumps.” Speak for yourself! “In addition to the sides’ aims (29th over),” says John Starbuck, “individual players are hoping to make their mark to survive the next week. Anyone from England whose name ends in a Y is at risk and getting desperate.” Ha. 31st over: England 56-2 (Sibley 19, Root 0) Now we have a contest: not just NZ v the draw, but Southee v Root. His opening ganbit is an inswinger, full length, which almost gets through Root’s defences as he shuffles across. That’s a wicket maiden and, for once, the dots don’t feel like a drag. Cometh the hour, cometh the Tim. Southee returns and instantly removes Crawley, playing the same loose drive that Sibley got away with a few minutes ago. Nicholls at gully takes the catch in front of his nose, and the New Zealanders have a sniff. 30th over: England 56-1 (Sibley 19, Crawley 2) Crawley gets a single off a leading edge, thanks to a misfield. Crap cricket all round! Please will someone take this game by the scruff of the neck. “Hell’s teeth,” says Jim on Twitter, “this is worse than watching Brearley and Boycott ‘chase’ the West Indies in the 1979 World Cup final. Smaller target, more overs, worse strike rate. Sitting at Lord’s almost hoping they’ll shake hands at 5.30 and put us all out of our misery.” 29th over: England 55-1 (Sibley 19, Crawley 1) Crawley shows his class for the first time with a flowing off drive, but a diving half-stop restricts him to a single. “I do declare,” says David Mel, promisingly, “that a series of unfortunate negatives – a day’s play lost to precipitation, dismal over rates, Burns being bashed on the head, precipitating two concussion breaks, poor England batting performance – have all conspired to showcase Test match appeal. From the embers (not Ashes) of despair and disappointment rises an enchanting and intriguing Red Ball cricket spectacle. Not harnessing Test Championship points gives Williamson a reason to chase for victory.” At the time of the declaration I’d have agreed with you, but the conspiracy is now between both sides, settling for a stalemate. 28th over: England 54-1 (Sibley 19, Crawley 0) We have a boundary! The first for an hour and a half, and it’s off the edge as Sibley chases a wide one from Wagner. If there’d been a third slip, it would have been a sitter. Wagner is trying to win this match, but I’m not sure that Williamson is. Michael Holding, meanwhile, has taken out his moral compass, applied it to the government’s Covid tests for people flying in, as he did the other day, and established that they are a scam. “Someone’s making a lot of money.” 27th over: England 50-1 (Sibley 15, Crawley 0) Sibley shovels Jamieson off his hip to bring up England’s fifty, which is greeted with ironic cheers – quite reasonably. Somewhere in Durham, Ben Stokes must be tearing his hair out. 26th over: England 49-1 (Sibley 14, Crawley 0) Wagner draws an inside edge from Crawley, which brings some oohs and aahs but no clink of timber. “Tim,” says Andrew Benton, “this is a battle pitting don’t-mess this-one-up-for-once England against batting-collapse-as-usual England. New Zealand are just a side order. Would be good if Bracey could get a reasonable score, he’s been rather in the shadows on his first England adventure.” Would be good if he could get a bat. I’m with you on the analysis of England’s mental state, but don’t we need to get away from taking New Zealand lightly? They’re a top team. 25th over: England 49-1 (Sibley 14, Crawley 0) Santner is taken off and Kyle Jamieson comes back. Williamson evidently wasn’t watching England in the winter when Crawley struggled to get going against slow left-armers – he likes the ball coming onto him. That’s a maiden from Jamieson: you can probably guess who was facing. 24th over: England 49-1 (Sibley 14, Crawley 0) Wagner, not for the first time, makes something happen. And in comes Crawley, on a pair, like about 36 per cent of England’s batsmen. “Gotta say that I agree with John Price (16th over),” says James Evans. “This was not a risky declaration from NZ. England’s lineup is inexperienced and under pressure, and the required run rate was higher than all three prior innings in the match. I think people are being swayed by Williamson-love. Had England been in this position, the narrative would be ‘could’ve declared half an hour earlier if we hadn’t scored so slowly yesterday’. (Not that I think NZ batted too slowly - England bowled very well and they couldn’t risk losing quick wickets.)” Wagner beats Burns outside off, then bowls the same ball, six inches to the left, and reaps his reward as Southee takes a crisp low catch at second slip. That’s good for New Zealand, and probably for England too. Burns goes off with a sore hand and 157 runs in the match. He had ten different partners and only looked in form when batting with the weakest of them, Jimmy Anderson. 23rd over: England 49-0 (Burns 25, Sibley 14) Sibley takes a run! Off Santner, with the tuck to square leg, which is Sibley’s signature stroke. Burns then gets in a tangle or two, and would be gone if Williamson had had a backward short leg. At this rate, if Zak Crawley ever comes in, he may well be greeted with a standing ovation. 22nd over: England 47-0 (Burns 24, Sibley 13) Southee takes a rare break as Neil Wagner comes on. He’s a man of two modes: one nasty, brutish and short, the other full and swinging. He goes full to Burns and finds that swing, but it’s from the hand so not hard to handle. That’s a maiden, so another bit of life drains from this contest. “I’ll see your exciting declaration,” says Adm Roberts, “and I’ll ... well, I’ll ignore it actually.” 21st over: England 47-0 (Burns 24, Sibley 13) Santner continues in his role as the only spinner in the village. And Sibley continues to block for England – he now has 13 from 59 balls. Joe Root may need to send someone out with a fresh pair of gloves and a note saying “Dom, don’t want to spoil your fun, but you do realise this is a run chase?”. Thanks Rob and afternoon everyone. This game was looking delicious when Kane Williamson declared, but Burns and Sibley have done their best to remove the flavour. Come on England, lose a wicket! 20th over: England 46-0 (Burns 23, Sibley 13) Another ball from Southee explodes at Burns, who gloves it fractionally short at Latham at second slip. That’s two vicious deliveries in as many overs, both of which could have dismissed Burns or broken his hand. On the subject of cricket charities, here’s Tom Levesley. “Cricket Without Boundaries does great work using cricket to work on issues like sexual health and promoting the game.” Right, I’m going to hand over to Tim for the rest of the day - you can email him on tim.delisle.casual@theguardian.com or tweet @TimdeLisle. Thanks for your company and emails throughout the game. Bye! 19th over: England 45-0 (Burns 22, Sibley 13) The left-arm spinner Mitchell Santner comes into the attack. He almost picks up a wicket with his first ball, a legside full toss that Burns lobs just short of mid-on. Had that gone to hand, it would have been the second most shambolic Test wicket on this ground: Rogers LBW b Swann in 2013 will never be beaten. “I love Kane’s aggressive declaration,” says Alistair Connor, “but bear in mind, NZ have two practice matches to work out how to win the World Test Championship in English conditions. If they lose one or both, they won’t give a toss (in fact, a toss in the final would be much more important to win).” 18th over: England 40-0 (Burns 21, Sibley 10) Burns is going to continue. That delivery from Southee, though not as extreme, brought to mind that famous delivery from David Saker back in the day. Meanwhile, Sibley survives a big LBW shout when he walks across his stumps to Southee. Williamson decides to review, though I’m pretty sure this is missing leg. Yep, it would only just have hit a fourth stump. 17.4 overs: England 35-0 (Burns 20, Sibley 10) Out of nothing, a delivery from Southee bursts from a fullish length to hit Burns on the glove. The ball lands safely on the off side, but there’s a break in play while Burns receives some treatment. That looked really nasty and he may struggle to grip the bat. 17th over: England 33-0 (Burns 20, Sibley 9) de Grandhomme has a huge shout for LBW against Sibley turned down by Richard Kettleborough. It looked too high, and Kane Williamson decides against a review. Another maiden from de Grandhomme, the seventh of the innings. It looks like the match is meandering to a draw. 16th over: England 33-0 (Burns 20, Sibley 9) Southee changes ends to replace Jamieson. He gets some prodigious inswing to Burns, who walks across and flicks to fine leg for four. In one game, he has jumped from third-choice opener to first choice. “Very little risk involved in the declaration,” says John Price. “Far too little experience in England’s batting line up to make a win a possibility. If Stokes, Woakes and Buttler had been playing, NZ might still be batting.” I know what you mean, though Crawley, Root, Pope and Lawrence in particular can score very quickly. I’d say it was riskier than most declarations. 15th over: England 29-0 (Burns 16, Sibley 9) Sibley plays a loose stroke and is beaten by de Grandhomme. A maiden. England are a fifth of the way to safety: 15 overs down, a maximum (realistically) of 60 to go. “Hiya Rob,” says Rob Little. “Re: the 13th over, does defleated = defeated + deflated? Excellent new verbiage if so.” You know you’re in trouble when typos are your best bits. 14th over: England 29-0 (Burns 16, Sibley 9) After all those maidens at the start of the innings, Jamieson is now going round the park. He concedes FIVE runs from his seventh over, which gives him figures of 7-5-6-0. “Well done to NZ for keeping this game alive and going for the win while risking a loss but I would add that this is the second time in 2021 that a team has adopted this tactic,” says Deepak. “I refer to the Gabba Test where India went for the win when a draw was all that was needed to retain the B-G Trophy. Test cricket is stronger as a result!” That’s true, although the circumstances were slightly different as India were batting last and Australia had more reason to take a risk with their declaration than New Zealand today. But I do agree that there is a new generation of players - hello Rishabh - who see opportunities rather than risks. 13th over: England 24-0 (Burns 15, Sibley 5) Burns softens his hands to steer de Grandhomme to the third-man boundary. New Zealand could use the impetus of a wicket; they’re starting to look a little defleated. 12th over: England 20-0 (Burns 11, Sibley 5) Jamieson spears an errant delivery past first slip for four byes. As with Robinson earlier in the day, I’m surprised that wasn’t called wide. With the batters looking more comfortable, Jamieson tries something different by moving round the wicket to Burns, and hits him high on the back leg with an excellent delivery. Burns tucks the last ball off the pads for a single, which ends Jamieson’s run of maidens. Instead he has the lamentable figures of 6-5-1-0. 11th over: England 15-0 (Burns 10, Sibley 5) Colin de Grandhomme replaces Southee, and Sibley survives a run-out referral from his first ball after being sent back by Burns. It was pretty tight, and he had to dive, but he made it. “It was Kane and NZ’s acceptance of the World Cup final result that saved the day from being poisoned and a now unpleasant memory,” says Jon Salisbury. “Certain other teams would still be in denial.” 10th over: England 14-0 (Burns 9, Sibley 5) After a torrid start, Sibley is starting to look more comfortable at the crease. He plays out another maiden from Jamieson without alarm. Jamieson has figures of 5-5-0-0, coincidentally my go-to formation for the big European away games on Championship Manager 01-02. “Afternoon Rob,” says Simon McMahon. “To return to the theme you started the Test with on Wednesday, New Zealand surely must be the most likeable team in world cricket, maybe even all sports. Their reaction to defeat in the World Cup final at Lord’s two years ago still to this day makes me proud to share the planet with people like them. I’m sure it will be no different whatever happens against India in the final of the World Test Championship. I think that’s enough patronising for one email?” It’s really bloomin’ hard not to unintentionally patronise them, isn’t it. 9th over: England 14-0 (Burns 9, Sibley 5) England’s path to an unlikely victory is probably to bat in a bubble until tea and then assess whether it’s worth risking defeat in an attempt to win. Surprisingly, the bookies have England at 8/1 and New Zealand at 7/1, with the draw 1/5. I think New Zealand have a much better chance than that, though the draw is favourite. “Dear Rob,” says Neil Clarke. “I wonder if you or your readers can suggest a cricket charity to commemorate the passing on Friday, of my good (and quirky) friend Pete N-H? The more unusual and niche, the better! He was an active and enthusiastic club cricketer until his recent illness along with being a committed Warwickshire fan.” I’m really sorry to hear that. I’m sure the readers will have a few ideas but the Lord’s Taverners is always a good option. 8th over: England 13-0 (Burns 9, Sibley 4) In New Zealand’s last Test on this ground, a classic in 2015, they were bowled out in 67.3 overs on the last day. Five of their XI played in that match, so they know it can be done, although they had already lost three wickets by this stage of their innings. Jamieson bowls his fourth consecutive maiden, though it wasn’t as good as the previous three - Burns was able to leave most of the deliveries. “A declaration with the word’s other meaning from NZ, a declaration of their sporting intent,” says Garry Sharp. “ I guess we are so used to Root dragging things out over the last few years (‘when will he declare?!’ ‘Why is he exposing his fast bowlers to injury with the bat when he should declare’, etc) that this approach to the game comes as a lovely surprise.” I’m not a great fan of Root’s captaincy but in his defence, most Test captains are pretty cautious when it comes to declarations. 7th over: England 13-0 (Burns 9, Sibley 4) Sibley drives Southee to mid-off and considers a Red Bull single before rightly deciding better of it. Southee beats him with a gorgeous outswinger, and then Sibley finally gets off the mark - and a pair - by working his 20th delivery to the square-leg boundary. Good shot. “I wonder if Kane Williamson actually realises what a top guy he is,” says Brian Withington. “I’m still amazed at how graciously he accepted the World Cup final ‘defeat’.” I suppose if he realised he was a top guy, he wouldn’t be one. 6th over: England 9-0 (Burns 9, Sibley 0) Jamieson has Burns in his sights for the first time, and beats him with a beauty. It’s another maiden, the third in a row for Jamieson. If it doesn’t rain, England could have a job on to save this match. “Well done to Kane Williamson for giving England the chance to win, or lose!” says Jim Hornby. “In my opinion draws are a stain on the sport of cricket, and something English mentality particularly suffers from. Better to draw than to lose? Too often that means taking away any risk or excitement. To win should mean that either the batting or bowling side excels in their role. To draw should be a consequence of both excelling equally, not as a planned outcome for fear of losing.” You are the great-grandson of Keith Miller and I claim my five pounds. 5th over: England 9-0 (Burns 9, Sibley 0) That ball from Jamieson actually hit Sibley just below the elbow, not on the glove. That really is nobody’s idea of a good time, especially when the bowler is 6ft 8ins. Sibley is fine to continue, though not yet to get off a pair. He has 0 from 15 balls. 4th over: England 8-0 (Burns 8, Sibley 0) Sibley, still on a pair, skims a drive along the floor to gully. Jamieson is probing relentlessly outside off stump and beats Sibley with a lovely delivery that bursts off the seam. The last ball of a majestic over goes the other way and raps Sibley on the glove. 3rd over: England 8-0 (Burns 8, Sibley 0) Southee moves round the wicket to Burns, with two slips and two men in the gully. Burns gets his second boundary with a sweetly timed push-drive through mid-on. “Afternoon Rob,” says Theo. “All four results eh? Someone’s gunning for a tie. I was thinking how close we’ve come to someone carrying the bat in this game, not once but twice. Has it ever happened multiple times in a game? And will it be Dom or Rory who takes us through today?” I’m pretty sure it has happened in first-class cricket, but not in an international game. 2nd over: England 4-0 (Burns 4, Sibley 0) A nervous moment for Dom Sibley, who is on a pair and edges Kyle Jamieson on the bounce to first slip. His hands were soft enough to ensure it didn’t carry. It’s an excellent first over from Jamieson, with every delivery challenging Sibley’s judgement of whether to play or leave. “Love the declaration,” says Neill Brown. “I wonder how much Williamson was influenced by Stokes’ absence? I suppose Ollie Robinson could play the Stokes role and become a national hero in the process?” Not just Stokes but Buttler too. It’s an awkward pitch and I’ll be surprised if England get anywhere near the target. 1st over: England 4-0 (Burns 4, Sibley 0) Immediate swing for Southee, which is just what New Zealand wanted, and Burns has a moment of fortune when a leading edge flies along the ground for four. I don’t know about you, but I feel energised by that declaration. All four results are back on, with a New Zealand win looking much more likely than it did this morning. Blimey, I didn’t expect this. It’s an adventurous decision from Kane Williamson, and means England need 273 in 75 overs. It’s on! So, what do we think for the declaration? Five more overs at run a ball would allow them to set a target of 306 in 68 overs, which should give them immunity against defeat. Play will resume at 1.26pm, it says here. 52.3 overs: New Zealand 169-6 (Watling 15, de Grandhomme 9) de Grandhomme pulls Anderson up and over for four. With New Zealand in one-day mode, I’m surprised England aren’t using their only white-ball bowler, Mark Wood. Not that it matters for now because the rain is getting heavier and the umpires have decided to take an early lunch. New Zealand have a handy lead of 272, and there are a maximum of 75.3 overs remaining (minus two for the change of innings). They could still win this. 52nd over: New Zealand 162-6 (Watling 15, de Grandhomme 2) The new batter Colin de Grandhomme gets off a pair by whapping a full toss for a single. New Zealand lead by 265. “Good morning Rob,” says Adam Roberts. “Your mention of Stuart B on Courtney Walsh’s knee immediately put me in mind of one of my favourite photos. My very young daughter, all golden curls and cherubic features, sitting on Michael Holding’s knee - completely oblivious to who he is - attacking him with a giant foam finger. “Which ties in nicely with today. Unexpectedly awake from 4am. I made the most of it by switching on the cricket at 5. First up is the mellifluous voice of Mikey H, explaining his late arrival at the Test because of the problems of getting out of Cayman to the UK (he had to fly through the States) - something my family is currently struggling with.” Henry Nicholls walks. He missed a reverse sweep at Root and gloved the ball into the off side, where Burns ran forward from slip and swooped to take a fine low catch. 51st over: New Zealand 159-5 (Nicholls 23, Watling 14) Some light rain is falling at Lord’s. Play continues for now, though the umpires could decide to take an early lunch. “Is it just me,” says Mark Steward, “or does Ollie Robinson look like the secret lovechild of Freddie Flintoff and Steve Harmison?” He reminds me more of Harmison when he bats, though he’s obviously more accomplished. I suppose there are many worse lovechildren to resemble. 50th over: New Zealand 157-5 (Nicholls 22, Watling 13) Root hurries through another over, and why not. 49th over: New Zealand 156-5 (Nicholls 22, Watling 12) Watling edges Anderson for four, which takes New Zealand’s lead to 259. There are still a maximum of 79 overs remaining; I’d imagine they will given England a target of around 310 in 67 overs. 48th over: New Zealand 151-5 (Nicholls 22, Watling 7) Root continues. Nicholls swipes him over mid-on for four and then misses a huge slog-sweep. Had he connected with that, no outdoor brunch on St John’s Wood High Street would have been safe. New Zealand lead by 254, and I’m starting to wonder whether England are sleepwalking into a horror movie. 47th over: New Zealand 144-5 (Nicholls 16, Watling 6) Or maybe Root came on so that Anderson can change ends, which is what he has just done. One from the over. “Finding the endless moaning about over rates on telly and radio increasingly irritating,” says Andy Moore. “Why can’t we just accept that in the modern game bowling 15 overs per hour isn’t feasible (what with reviews, drinks breaks etc)? Is there any other sport that places more importance in the time of day than the amount of play to be completed? Looking forward to the Ryder Cup concluding at 6pm sharp with America 1/2 point ahead and Justin Rose 4 up with 5 to play. Really grinds my gears.” I can see both sides of this argument. I find it hard to angry about slow over-rates, but then I haven’t paid however much to get into the ground. Your point is a good one, that there are more natural interruptions nowadays, concussion checks and the like, but equally 12 overs an hour is pushing it. Maybe 14 per hour is a more realistic target, I don’t know. 46th over: New Zealand 142-5 (Nicholls 15, Watling 5) Joe Root replaces Anderson, perhaps with England’s inadequate over-rate in mind. Five from the over. “In cryptic crossword circles, the process which you just have described about de Stael (ie divining the existence of something highbrow from something distinctly lowbrow) is known as ‘Ninja Turtling’,” says Tom Adam. “It stems from, ‘Of course I’ve heard of Donatello. He’s the one with the purple mask.’” That’s a good phrase, I hadn’t heard of that. Also, David Chase would like to discuss your description of the Sopranos as ‘distinctly lowbrow’. It’s okay, he’s in a good mood. 45th over: New Zealand 137-5 (Nicholls 11, Watling 4) I thought they might promote Colin de Grandhomme for some bish-bosh, but BJ Watling is the new batter, and he gets going with an emphatic cut for four. That was a useful cameo from Taylor: 33 from 35 balls with one four, two sixes and a comprehensive range of fresh-air shots. “Kudos to Michael Keane for not venting spleen on anyone else (the pandemic aside) for his mis-ticketing episode,” says Ian Copestake. “I wish him a very tasty lunch.” I hope it’s not egg and bacon. Ross Taylor’s eccentric innings comes to an end. He chases a deliberately wide delivery from Wood and snicks it through to Bracey, who takes a nice low catch to his right. 44th over: New Zealand 132-4 (Taylor 33, Nicholls 10) Jimmy Anderson comes on for Stuart Broad, and Taylor survives a very good-looking LBW shout. The umpire Michael Gough thought there was an inside edge, but the two noises were actually the ball hitting both pads. England have wasted all three of their reviews; had they been able to go upstairs, Taylor would have been out. “Just re-emerging from your Cricinfo link/wormhole in the 34th over,” says Jim Crane. “That 1989 Australia tour itinerary - madon! Six Tests, visits to all the counties, and then casually rounding it off with two bilateral series against Netherlands and Denmark! Imagine rocking up to an ICC board meeting in 2021 with that proposal.” It’s great isn’t it. They played a county game the day after they regained the Ashes, and the stand-in captain Geoff Marsh chose to bat first on a green mamba because, in his words, “the boys are all still pissed”. 43rd over: New Zealand 126-4 (Taylor 30, Nicholls 7) An extraordinary shot from Ross Taylor, who slogs across the line at Wood and top edges the ball high over third man for six. Taylor is so dangerous that, despite middling almost nothing, he has raced to 30 from 31 balls. “Morning Rob,” says Michael Keane. “I’m heading home from Lord’s where, on arrival at the Grace Gate, it transpired that my ticket was for yesterday. Woe is me. As a newly minted member I had thought my days of ticket tragedies were over. But for now even those of us bedecked in egg and bacon need to book a seat. Bloody global pandemic... Looks like it’s the OBO and TMS for me today then. Maybe I’ll make lunch for my better half or something. Feck.” This is mildly heartbreaking, and extremely funny. (I say that as the kind of airhead who does things like this all the time.) 42nd over: New Zealand 118-4 (Taylor 23, Nicholls 6) Nicholls goes into one-day mode, walking down the pitch to slice Broad high over the slips for four. Broad replies with another big inswinger - too big, this time, as it veers away for four leg byes. New Zealand have scored 56 from 12 overs this morning; they lead by 221. “If Friedrich Nietzsche was on comms,” says Ian Copestake, his eyebrows unintentionally betraying the extent of that if, “Zak Crawley’s cover drive would be a cue for his line that, ‘Art is the supreme task and the truly metaphysical activity in this life.’” 41st over: New Zealand 109-4 (Taylor 23, Nicholls 1) Mark Wood replaces Ollie Robinson (14-5-26-3) and beats Taylor with the first and last deliveries of the over. Two runs from it. “The 2000 Code of the Laws of Cricket was the first to use ‘fielder’, instead of ‘fieldsman’,” says Alan Tuffery. That’s interesting; I expected it to be much earlier than that. 40th over: New Zealand 107-4 (Taylor 22, Nicholls 1) That’s Broad’s 518th Test wicket, which puts him one behind Courtney Walsh, the man whose lap Broad used to sit on when he was a kid. Imagine the eight-year-old Broad’s face if you told him they would both end up with 500 Test wickets. After a mildly scandalous amount of misfortune, Stuart Broad finally gets his first wicket of the match in his 38th over. Latham, beaten the ball before, is hit on the back leg by a big inswinger bowled from wider on the crease. Michael Gough gives it out and, though Latham reviews, it’s hitting enough of leg stump for the original decision to stand. 39th over: New Zealand 106-3 (Latham 36, Taylor 22) Taylor misses another disgusting mow across the line at Robinson. But then he finally nails the shot, pinging Robinson over midwicket for a huge six. He is always dangerous, even when his bat seems to have no middle. “Hi Rob,” says Pete Salmon. “Who remembers The Professionals? We’ve been watching Bodie and Doyle at ours as our lockdown treat – just started the final series and already mourning getting to the end. Two very nice moments for OBOers recently. One, Bodie playing club cricket, moving rapidly through the nineties with a series of pull shots, and then getting bowled for 97 after being distracted by a call to duty (followed by getting changed out of his whites in the back of a speeding car, as we’ve all done at some stage). And then in last night’s episode, Doyle having to pretend he’s an intellectual. Bodie: ‘Can you keep the patter up?’ Doyle: ‘Of course, I read the Guardian.’” I’m now desperate to know what Arthur Daley made of our esteemed rag. 38th over: New Zealand 97-3 (Latham 35, Taylor 14) “Excellent Guardianista preamble reference to the French-Swiss Anne Louise Germaine de Staël-Holstein,” says Brian Withington. “She almost invented the Guardian strap line with the phrase ‘Search for the truth is the noblest occupation of man; its publication is a duty’. Apparently she is also quoted as saying, ‘The more I see of man, the more I like dogs’, so something for [redacted] readers, too.” While I’d love to flaunt my education, and perhaps explore what Nietzsche’s philosophy can tell us about Zak Crawley’s cover drive, I only know the Madade de Staël quote because Meadow mentions it in the Sopranos. 37th over: New Zealand 93-3 (Latham 34, Taylor 11) Taylor doesn’t look remotely comfortable against Robinson. He is beaten outside off stump, edges short of the slips and then hacks desperately across the line for a couple of runs. Robinson smiles at Taylor with contempt and then has a big LBW appeal turned down when Taylor misses another smear. England was their last review - it hit him miles outside off stump. That wasn’t great captaincy from Joe Root. But it was a brilliant over from Robinson, which concludes with another play and miss by Taylor 36th over: New Zealand 91-3 (Latham 34, Taylor 8) “The last day of the match will not be so drab if Ross Taylor and Colin de Grandhomme can come in and smash Anderson and co. to make a hundred-odd runs in 90 minutes,” writes Gangesh. “Chasing 300-plus in 70 overs will enthuse England, and their aggression could provide the Kiwi bowlers opportunities. So that’s a possibility Kane Williamson can explore to inject some interest in the game - provided, of course, the notorious English weather stays fine!” A repeat of the last day in 2015 would be all kinds of fun. 35th over: New Zealand 87-3 (Latham 33, Taylor 6) England would love to get Taylor early as he is somebody who can score quickly, as he shows with a cracking extra cover drive for four later. Robinson pulls his length back as a result and rips one past the edge. Lovely response. “Has anyone seen a split screen of Ollie Robinson and Josh Hazlewood bowling?” says Gary Naylor. “The more I see of the Sussex bruiser, the more I think of the Australian err... bruiser.” Hazlewood’s a bit quicker, isn’t he? But otherwise it’s an excellent comparison – forensic accuracy, sharp bounce, seam movement and a hint of malevolence. 34th over: New Zealand 81-3 (Latham 32, Taylor 1) There’s an urgency to New Zealand’s batting that wasn’t evident last night, so perhaps my assumption of a draw was premature. I can think of one precedent in particular. But it’s really not easy to score quickly on this pitch. Broad beats Latham with a stunning delivery and then has him dropped by Crawley at midwicket, a sharp two-handed chance to his right. Broad has had no luck at all in this game. “I can live with batter,” says Adrian Goldman. “What I can’t live with is that in science, sulfate is now the expected spelling, not sulphate. Beyond dismay: pretty much the end of civilisation as we know it.” I’ll see your sulfate and raise you T20 scorecards that have dot balls instead of maidens. It’s cultural vandalism. What the hell is 2-4-12-1 supposed to mean? 33rd over: New Zealand 80-3 (Latham 32, Taylor 0) In the history of Test cricket there have been 3,054 debuts, but none quite look Ollie Robinson’s: 42 runs, seven cheap wickets and a public shaming. He loses his line at the end of the over, spearing a delivery down the leg side for four byes. James Bracey was pretty gutted that it wasn’t called a wide. A third wicket for Ollie Robinson. Wagner, roughed up by a couple of good short balls, top-edged a hook miles in the air and was calmly caught by James Bracey. 32nd over: New Zealand 72-2 (Latham 31, Wagner 10) Stuart Broad gets a chance to bowl at Neil Wagner, who dismissed him yesterday and celebrated with a red-faced flourish. Broad appeals for LBW first ball, but it was going down on the angle. Wagner then cracks two boundaries, a flash up and over the cordon and a majestic flick through midwicket. I’d love to hear Broad’s internal monologue right now. “This fuss comes up regularly,” says John Starbuck. “’Batter’ is, agreed, both an Americanism (by way of the English invention of baseball) and a flour, milk and egg mixture. But think what might happen if we used ‘bowlsman’ as a standard. If we can do it with one essential element of cricket, we can do it with the other. Besides, look at the ambiguities of ‘pitch’ and ‘wicket’, which vary a lot depending on context. Language is meant to be fluid.” Test Match Special overseas link Here you are. 31st over: New Zealand 62-2 (Latham 30, Wagner 2) Ollie Robinson will open the bowling, a reward for his forensic excellence last night. He switches over and round the wicket to Latham, giving him precisely no opportunities to score. Thus, it’s a maiden. “The OED has instances ‘batter’ being used in relation to cricket going back about 200 years, so it’s not like it’s without precedent,” says Andrew Cosgrove. “Also, you don’t talk about a ‘bowlsman’ do you? Anyway, do you think England are capable of batting out two sessions for a draw?” I do, I do. A collapse wouldn’t shock me but I think it’s unlikely, especially as there are likely to be one of two rain interruptions. This is a majestic piece from Andy Bull, with a particularly brilliant intro. “I am becoming more &amp; more dismayed by the use of the term ‘batter’ in cricket,” says Ben Carter. “All the commentators are doing it. The term is BATSMAN. Are you all coordinated by someone who tells you what to say?” Yes, last month Mother Cricket gave her 475 children a collective brollocking for our sexist terminology. Seriously, though, with everything else that’s going on in the world right now, is a change of language designed to increase inclusivity really worthy of dismay? I can understand thinking it’s a bit heavy-handed, not that I’d necessarily agree, but dismay, I can’t have that. The draws are back in town. Today, all things being equal, England will draw their third consecutive Test at home for the first time since the late eighties. And though that’s mainly down to the weather, it also reflects a different approach and a greater resilience under Chris Silverwood. The Bayliss-era England might have thrown the towel in when they slipped to 140 for six; instead, Rory Burns and Ollie Robinson (with bat and ball) stalled New Zealand’s momentum to such an extent that they finished the day crawling along at two an over. New Zealand will resume on 62 for two, a lead of 165. With a maximum of 98 overs to bowl, they could still force victory on a pitch is becoming more uneven. But with a forecast for showers – of the meteorological rather than the middle-order kind – that looks unlikely. Madame de Stael said that one must choose in life between boredom and suffering. England politely request a boring last day.","charCount":"35421","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/timdelisle\">Tim de Lisle</a> (now) and <a href=\"profile/robsmyth\">Rob Smyth</a> (earlier)"},{"headline":"Covid live: UK records 5,341 new cases; eradicating virus not ‘reasonable target’, says WHO official","standfirst":"<p>Latest updates: cases reported since yesterday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2021/jun/06/coronavirus-live-news-tony-blair-greater-freedoms-fully-vaccinated-uk-matt-hancock-covid-latest-updates?page=with:block-60bce4bd8f08b9889b36ab0e#block-60bce4bd8f08b9889b36ab0e\">up by over 2,000 from 3,111 last Sunday</a>; WHO official says<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2021/jun/06/coronavirus-live-news-tony-blair-greater-freedoms-fully-vaccinated-uk-matt-hancock-covid-latest-updates?page=with:block-60bca84c8f082ac930aebd5b#block-60bca84c8f082ac930aebd5b\"> people must learn to live with Covid</a></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/jun/06/mix-and-match-covid-booster-jabs-may-be-offered-in-uk-vaccine-autumn\">Ministers considering ‘mix and match’ booster jabs in UK</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/jun/06/tony-blair-calls-for-new-pass-to-allow-vaccinated-people-more-freedoms\">Tony Blair says fully vaccinated people should get greater freedoms </a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/06/data-on-delta-variant-splits-scientists-on-lifting-final-covid-restrictions\">Data on Delta variant splits scientists on lifting final Covid restrictions</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/jun/05/share-vaccines-or-climate-deal-will-fail-rich-countries-are-told\">Share vaccines or climate deal will fail, rich countries told</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak/all\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a><br></li></ul>","trailText":"Latest updates: cases reported since yesterday up by over 2,000 from 3,111 last Sunday; WHO official says people must learn to live with Covid","byline":"Edna Mohamed (now); Harry Taylor and Jessica Murray (earlier)","main":"<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"05e20bd9-1027-46ca-966c-c3ffaccfa665\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pHwi4YAQp4U?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>","body":"<div id=\"block-60bce5458f08b9889b36ab19\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-06T15:09:59.055Z\">4.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Hi, I’m Edna Mohamed; I’ll be taking over from my colleague <strong>Harry Taylor</strong> for the rest of the afternoon.

If I miss anything, you can message me on Twitter or drop me an email at edna.mohamed.casual@theguardian.com The UK records 5,341 positive coronavirus cases on Sunday and four new deaths, according to government data. This is an increase of 2,230 on last Sunday when 3,111 cases were reported. While daily deaths are down -1% in the last seven days, case numbers are up by 11,022 (49.0%) in the same period. Here’s a round-up of today’s latest coronavirus news from around the world: Eradicating Covid-19 worldwide is not a “reasonable target”, according to a World Health Organization envoy on the virus. Dr David Nabarro said people will have to learn to live with the virus in circulation. Boris Johnson has outlined his ambition to see the planet vaccinated by the end of 2022, ahead of the G7 summit in Cornwall starting on Friday. He will also call for a global watch system to identify new variants. Countries in the Asia-Pacific region are looking to develop their home-grown vaccines as supply shortages threaten efforts to tackle the pandemic. UK health secretary Matt Hancock says it’s “too early” to make a final decision on whether there will be a delay to restrictions being relaxed on 21 June. Former UK prime minister Tony Blair has called for the rules to be relaxed for people who have had both doses of the vaccine, and for Covid-certification for travel. More than 57m doses of Covid-19 vaccines have been given to people in the UK, latest NHS England data shows. Nearly 23.5 million people have had both doses of the vaccine, with 33.7 million having had at least one jab. UK government ministers are considering giving people a different type of Covid vaccine as an autumn booster, after early results from “mix and match” trials appeared to show promise for an enhanced immune response. Russia has reported 9,145 new Covid-19 cases and a further 399 deaths. A total of 5,117,274 people have tested positive and 123,436 have died. Russia’s own statistics service suggests the actual number to die from the virus may be higher. Germany has registered 2,440 new cases in the last 24 hours, and 24.7 cases per 100,000 people, according to the country’s Robert Koch Institute. A further 74 people have died from the virus, meaning the death toll stands at 89,222. No deaths have been reported from Covid in Wales for the tenth day in a row, according to the latest public health statistics. A total of 92 new cases have been confirmed, bringing the number of infections recorded in the country to 213,091. 5,569 people have died. Campaigners have criticised Boris Johnson for his “audacity” in calling for the world’s population to be vaccinated by the end of next year (see 08:31), accusing him of blocking attempts to scale up production. Global Justice Now said the UK is one of the countries, along with Germany, which is stopping an intellectual property waiver on vaccines and treatments at the World Trade Organization. India and South Africa first proposed a waiver eight months ago, but some countries have obstructed it. The US said last month it would support a waiver. The director of the charity, Nick Dearden, said: “The audacity of Boris Johnson preaching about the need to vaccinate the world is staggering. The UK is one of the last remaining countries blocking an intellectual property waiver on Covid-19 vaccines. “Simply setting a deadline is not leadership. If the prime minister wants to achieve global vaccination by 2022, he should follow in Joe Biden’s footsteps and support an intellectual property waiver on Covid-19 vaccines and treatments.” More than 57 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines have now been given to people in the UK, latest NHS England data shows. The total – 57,193,641 jabs – include both first and second jabs. The latest figures show a total of 590,645 people were vaccinated yesterday. Nearly 23.5 million people have had both doses of the vaccine, with 33.7 million having had at least one jab. Ministers are considering giving people a different type of Covid vaccine as an autumn booster, it has emerged, after early results from “mix and match” trials appeared to show promise for an enhanced immune response. Four different coronavirus jabs have been approved for use in the UK, with more under regulatory review. While people are currently offered two doses of the same jab, researchers have been exploring whether offering a second dose of a different Covid vaccine could generate a stronger immune response. It is also expected that people will be offered a third, “booster” injection, potentially in the autumn, in part to protect them against variants with some resistance to existing vaccines. One possibility being looked at is that this third jab could be of a different type to people’s initial two, a government source said. Trials worldwide are exploring the impact of max and match doses. In the UK, the Com-Cov study, launched in February, is investigating the possibility of using the Oxford/AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax vaccines. The Sunday Telegraph reported promising results from separate trials of more than 600 people in Spain and 300 in Germany. Matt Hancock has formally denied the claim from Dominic Cummings that he incorrectly promised people discharged from hospitals to care homes were being tested for Covid at the start of the pandemic, saying: “No, I did not.” The rejection, after lengthy questioning on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, follows the health secretary’s previous refusal to deny explicitly the claim in the Commons and at a Downing Street press conference, a day after Cummings’ explosive claims to MPs. But in an indication of Hancock’s likely approach when he is quizzed by the same parliamentary committee on Thursday, he argued that Cummings had not in fact accused him of wrongly claiming tests were already being done in March last year – only that they would happen when testing capacity was available. Eradicating Covid-19 from the world is not currently a “reasonable target”, a World Health Organization Covid-19 official has said. Dr David Nabarro, a special envoy to the WHO, said people will have to learn to live with the disease, comments which were echoed by Dame Anne Johnson, a professor of infection disease epidemiology at University College London (UCL). Nabarro told Sky News’ Trevor Phillips on Sunday: “Humanity is going to have to learn how to co-exist with this virus, preventing it from spiking and then surging and causing hotspots of disease, and we’re going to have to be able to do this for the foreseeable future. “Eradication is not currently a reasonable target for the world.” He said: “Each time there is a sudden surge, it does stimulate in one’s mind the thought that there might be a new variant appearing. That wouldn’t be surprising.” He said that will be “the pattern for the future”, adding: “This virus isn’t going away any time soon, there will be variants emerging.” A Dublin pub landlord has said the hospitality industry in Ireland faces difficulties replacing staff who left during the pandemic. Kevin Barden, whose family owns the traditional Irish music pub O’Donoghue’s, told PA Media he has been fortunate to welcome back 19 of his 20-strong team after 15 months of closure. Others have struggled to recruit staff and are finding it hard to fill roles ahead of reopening. “We’ve only lost one for the moment and hopefully we’ll get him back by the end of the summer. So we’ve been lucky enough – we’ve retained the majority of the staff here, which has been great.” Like so many workers across Ireland, the staff have received an income through government Covid-19 wage subsidy support. “They’ve obviously had to take a hit and they all have families and mortgages and bills to pay as well,” said Barden. It’s a month tomorrow since Public Health England published a report on the India variant in the UK when there were 509 identified cases. Since then the case numbers in the country have risen 20-fold and case numbers are continuing to rise. This thread from PHE expert Meaghan Kall on where things in England are now is well worth a read: Countries in the Asia-Pacific region are looking to develop their home-grown vaccines as supply shortages threaten efforts to tackle the pandemic. Japan, South Korea, India, Taiwan, Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam are hoping to develop their own jabs after struggling to get vaccines from overseas, according to the South China Morning Post. While locally developed vaccines aren’t likely to affect the pandemic in its current phase, they believe it’s a better long-term approach. Germany has registered 2,440 new cases in the last 24 hours, and 24.7 cases per 100,000 people, according to the country’s Robert Koch Institute. The latest figures show 74 more people have died from the virus, meaning the death toll now stands at 89,222. There has been a total of 3,700,367 positive tests for Covid since the start of the pandemic. The new Delta variant of coronavirus appears to be about 40% more transmissible than the variant it has largely replaced, Matt Hancock has said, making government decisions about whether to ease restrictions in England on 21 June “more difficult”. Saying that under-30s will be called to begin vaccinations from next week, the health secretary confirmed it was still possible the reopening programme could be delayed or some rules kept in place. “We consider all options,” he told Sky News. Away from the UK, Russia has reported 9,145 new Covid-19 cases and a further 399 deaths. A total of 5,117,274 people have tested positive in the country. The death toll in the country now stands at 123,436. Russia’s own state statistics service, Rosstat, keeps its own records and said on Friday that about 270,000 people had died from the virus and related causes as of April. Excess deaths in the county stand at 425,000 from between April 2020 and April 2021. Marr rounds off by asking whether the health secretary regretted using the phrase about a “protective ring” around care homes. “I said that much later about what we were doing for the winter plans, but it’s been interpreted,” he says, but changes the subject on to the return of children to school tomorrow after half-term. “On testing, tomorrow schoolchildren will be going back to school. You must get tests done this evening because right now secondary school-age children getting their tests done tonight is the most important thing that can be done today.” Marr asks whether Hancock will apologise for any failings on his part during the pandemic, as Cummings did. “At that time everybody was working as hard as possible to protect as many lives as possible on the evidence we had at the time,” he says. “This is true of different administrations and across the whole of Europe. “I know those decisions were taken on the best evidence with the best of intentions.” Marr ends by asking whether Hancock’s been honest and transparent during the pandemic after claims made by Dominic Cummings during his select committee appearance last week. He plays a clip of Cummings saying that in March 2020 Hancock said people would be tested before they went back to care homes and there was a protective shield around them. “It’s complete nonsense,” Cummings said. He asks Hancock whether he told Johnson that people would be tested before they went into care homes. He replies: “We know the testing wasn’t available to test everybody. The advice was that very few people would be able to pass on Covid if they didn’t have any symptoms, so we reserved that for people with symptoms. “The situation with regards to care homes, we brought in a policy of wanting to test everybody going into a care home as soon as we had those tests available. Everyone had a challenge around Europe, in Scotland in Wales, some of the most vulnerable to Covid live in care homes, but at the time, you’ll remember we didn’t have the testing capacity and I built that up, put in place the hundreds of thousands targets and then we could put that into place.” On the idea of children being vaccinated, Hancock says the government is following clinical advice. “There’s good advantages, there’s the reduction in transmission from children to parents and grandparents who might be vulnerable. There’s advantages in protecting education, if one child gets one positive test, the whole bubble has to isolate. “We should follow and listen to clinical advice … I don’t want to put pressure on them with their advice. People should be reassured that whatever steps we take they are on a clinically advised basis.” In response to a question about vaccine passports, or certification along the lines mentioned by Tony Blair, Hancock says: “We know some other countries are going to require it. So if you want to go some other countries, you already have to, the EU are talking about it. It’s my job to make sure you can have that. “If you download the NHS app right now and register it will show you your vaccine status, so you can prove it if you want to go to Greece, for example.” He says rules in the UK are down to a certification review and that there is downsides on a mandatory basis. Hancock repeats Sage’s findings that the India variant is 40% more transmissible. In turn Marr quotes a Sage report saying that a variant of that level of transmissibility would cause severe disruption to the roadmap. Hancock says: “We’re watching the case rates and the rate in which that transfers into hospitalisations. Thankfully that link, which was absolutely rock solid over the autumn, is severed but not broken. There are some people in hospital who have been double vaccinated, but very few. The majority in hospital haven’t been. “Critically, those who are double vaccinated, even if they’re in hospital, they appear to be less ill. The vaccine is working and is our way through it, the new variant, which is more transmissible is making that calculation harder.” Matt Hancock’s now appearing on Marr, after his earlier interview on Sky News’ Trevor Phillips on Sunday. He first responds to an earlier interview by Bob Geldof calling for more vaccines to go to developing countries. The health secretary references Boris Johnson’s call to get the planet vaccinated by the end of 2022, and the rollout of the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab at cost to low and middle income countries. The cut to the aid budget, he says, is supposed to be temporary. “We also have this enormous cost there, so we can continue investing in the NHS, which we are doing, but there’s many things we are doing, leadership on climate change and certainly the work that AZ and Oxford University have done that a quarter of the vaccines across the whole world are delivered with UK taxpayers cash, at cost, no charge on intellectual property, and that’s saving lives everywhere.” Nandy backs vaccination for children after the JCVI’s approval of the Pfizer jab for 12-15 year olds. “I think the regulator has been clear that for 12-year-olds and over the Pfizer vaccine is safe and it’s apparent that the rise in transmission rates is being driven by young people. “It’s right to follow the public health officials particularly the ones that are saying ‘this is what we want to do’. “If public health directors are saying ‘we’ve got a problem in our secondary schools and we need to open up the vaccine, not to make it mandatory, offer the chance to get them vaccinated’, then we need to listen. If we’d taken that approach from the start we’d be in a far better place now.” On international travel Nandy says she believes the current Amber list for international travel from the UK should be scrapped. Current rules mean people travelling to the UK from those countries must quarantine at home or the place they are staying for 10 days and take two Covid tests during that period. She adds: “It’s confusing and that confusion is dangerous at the moment and risks unravelling all the progress that we’ve made. “I think we should have robust quarantine measures for people coming back into the country. “We need to be much clearer that at the moment travelling overseas, particularly when you’ve got countries like Vietnam and Thailand on the amber list where new variants are emerging and being imported into the UK, is the wrong thing to do and the government ought to be clear about that.” Labour’s shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy tells Marr says she’s sceptical on a domestic level on vaccine passports. “I think the global case for vaccine passports is clear because other countries are doing it, but at a domestic level for many of the reasons that you’ve highlighted, discriminatory practices, how they would be enforced, I think there are potentially real problems.” Here’s more detail on the proposal put forward by the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change. People who have been vaccinated against Covid-19 should be able to travel abroad using a new digital pass and go to “vaccine-only” venues such as restaurants or sports stadiums, Tony Blair says today. Releasing a report entitled “Less Risk, More Freedom”, by the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, the former prime minister says the time has come “to distinguish for the purposes of freedom from restriction between the vaccinated and unvaccinated”. The report argues that to date, measures intended to reduce the spread of disease have treated populations as largely homogenous groups. As a result, restrictions – such as national lockdowns, regional-tier systems and entire schools closed following outbreaks – have been blunt instruments. Tony Blair’s on BBC One’s Andrew Marr Show. He says he thinks it’s “uncertain” as to whether the UK will carry on with rules being relaxed on 21 June. Marr says that with introducing vaccine passports or certification status, it will end up discriminating against people who have not had the jab. Blair replies: “Discrimination has got a very loaded meaning in the English Language now. Really when it comes to risk management it’s all about discrimination. The reason we vaccinate the elderly first is that they are more at risk. The reason we ensure people are vaccinated is that we reduce the risk of transmission.” In response to a follow-up question, the former prime minister adds that there needs to be exemptions made for certain groups, including the disabled, as it would be “totally inappropriate” to discriminate against them. Taiwan reported 343 new Covid-19 cases on Sunday, down from 511 reported the day before. The US announced on Sunday that it will give it 750,000 vaccine doses. Phillips asks if we could be giving more vaccines to other countries ahead of the G7 summit next week. Hancock says: “My first duty is to protect the UK population, and that’s to reduce transmission. The way we’re helping the rest of the world is giving away at cost the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine and that means of the 2 billion doses delivered across the world, 500m doses are the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. 70% of those doses are in low and middle-income countries. “The reason we’ve been able to do this is is that we’ve made it available at cost, no charge of intellectual property from the start. I’m delighted there’s a debate, around the G7 table on how to vaccinate the world, but this country has done more than any other by ensuring the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is available at cost.” Responding on whether the government will respond to Blair’s call earlier (see 8.19), for global vaccine passports, as well as relaxations domestically for people who have had the jab. Hancock says: “This debate has been going on for months and we’ve been doing the work inside government, and we’ll be coming out with our answers on that soon. “We know it’s going to be needed internationally, on the domestic front, that’s a matter for Michael Gove.” Phillips asks if the government will want to vaccinate all children. The UK regulator, Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, approved the Pfizer jab for use on children aged between 12 and 15 earlier this week. A story in the Sunday Telegraph said that under plans drawn up by Whitehall, they would be offered the jab from mid-August. Hancock doesn’t rule it out, and says: “We’ve got a few weeks until we come out with a plan on how and if we take this forward. “We know the vaccine both protects you and helps stops it transmitting, and I want to protect education as much as anybody does. Making sure we don’t have those whole bubbles going home and the isolation, that has big upsides for education.” Under-30s in England will be invited to get their jabs this week, Hancock adds, as he says the link between infection and serious illness has been “severed but not broken” by the vaccine. Phillips asks whether there will be a modification of the roadmap, such as lifting lockdown but still asking people to work from home. “There are a series of things at the moment that we’ve said will be part of step four, which include the rule of six and the fact there’s still some businesses that are closed. “We have four reviews into international travel and certification and social distancing, and we are concluding those reviews and doing that at the same time.” Hancock urges people to go and get their second dose to try and stop the damage being caused by the India variant, that is 40% more transmissible. “It’s more difficult to manage this virus with the new variant. But after two doses of vaccine we are confident that you get the same protection as you did with the old variant. “The vaccine works just as effectively, and everyone must get their second jab though, as the first on its own isn’t quite as effective.” The health secretary Matt Hancock is on Sky News’ Trevor Phillips on Sunday, as part of a morning broadcast tour. He asks Hancock whether there will be a delay to the relaxing of restrictions on 21 June. “It’s too early to make a final decision on that,” Hancock begins. “The prime minister and the team will be looking over all the data over this week and we’ve said we will be giving people enough time ahead of 21 June when this is pencilled in, this next step.” He says it will depend on the four tests; cases, hospitalisations, the rollout of the vaccine and the impact of new variants. Hancock admits that there has been a significant impact of the Delta variant. Boris Johnson will urge G7 leaders to “defeat Covid” by vaccinating the world by the end of next year. The prime minister will stress the importance of the programme when he meets leaders on Friday in Cornwall for the first face-to-face G7 meeting since the beginning of the pandemic. The US, France, Germany, Italy and Japan have all said how many doses they will donate to the global vaccine programme, Covax. However the UK and Canada are yet to announce how many they will contribute. Johnson will also call for a global watch system to catch new variants before they spread more widely. Johnson said: “I’m calling on my fellow G7 leaders to join us to end this terrible pandemic and pledge will we never allow the devastation wreaked by coronavirus to happen again.” Head of the UK vaccines taskforce Kate Bingham is to be given a damehood, the Telegraph has reported, after getting the UK access to millions of doses of six different jabs. Her expected honour is among a number in next week’s Queen’s Birthday honours dedicated to “heroes” in the pandemic. Bingham was appointed to the role in May last year and left at the end of 2020. People who have had both doses of a Covid-19 vaccine should have restrictions relaxed for them, according to former prime minister Tony Blair. Blair’s thinktank, the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, sets out how the country should remain open if the virus persists in the population. The report, Less Risk, More Freedom, says that the NHS app – which is currently used for contact tracing – should be replaced with a system of global health passes. “The health pass needs to be usable both by national border authorities and other organisations within countries. It should also include the ability to demonstrate time-restricted testing status for those who aren’t able to be vaccinated. “With this ability to securely prove vaccination status, we can move beyond blunt, catch-all tools and align with other countries by removing certain restrictions for the fully vaccinated – thereby enabling us to sustainably reopen the economy,” the report says.

It is understood that Harding, a Conservative peer, is considering formally applying to replace Sir Simon Stevens, who is leaving the job in July after seven years. While Stevens’ whole career has been in healthcare and health management, Harding spent the bulk of her working life in areas such as supermarkets and telecoms, notably as head of the Talk Talk group. Since 2017, she has chaired the board of NHS Improvement, an oversight arm of NHS England. Her first day-to-day management job in health came a year ago when she was appointed to lead the Covid test and trace service in England, with a budget that rose to £37bn. Harding, who is married to the Conservative MP John Penrose, faced regular criticism over the service’s performance and has acknowledged failings in how it has operated, though allies argue she has been unfairly maligned. Test and trace has been blamed by some for failing to better curb the spread of Covid variants, such as the highly transmissible Delta variant first identified in India, which has become dominant in the UK and is threatening plans to drop most lockdown restrictions this month. In August, Harding was also made the interim chair of the new UK Health Security Agency, which integrates the work of test and trace and takes over from Public Health England. Jenny Harries, formerly England’s deputy chief medical officer, has now taken over the role. The next head of NHS England will face the toll of disruption to non-Covid services, with one analysis saying more than 4.5 million people missed out on hospital treatment last year alone. Labour did not comment directly on Harding, but made plain the party was sceptical at the idea of her taking on ultimate responsibility for about 1.3 million NHS staff and an annual budget of more than £115bn. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said NHS patients and workers “will be looking for a new chief executive able to out-manoeuvre [the chancellor] Rishi Sunak” and secure enough funding for the service. He added: “Given the scale of the waiting list backlog including for cancer and mental health care, the NHS needs someone with a proven track record of improving services for patients.” Speaking separately, Justin Madders, the junior shadow health minister, said: “We hope the recruitment process takes candidates’ recent achievements into account, but test and trace’s performance speaks for itself.” Another key Covid-related appointee, Kate Bingham, who led the vaccines taskforce until the end of last year, is set to become a dame in this week’s Queen’s birthday honours, according to a report.

Meanwhile Lewis Hamilton, overtaken in the title race after a middling display in Monaco, has come out swinging in Azerbaijan. He left it late, though, enduring some disastrous practice sessions before screeching into second place in yesterday’s crash-strewn qualifying session, just ahead of Max Verstappen, the man who has overtaken him in the standings. </p> <p><strong>Last week was fast and furious.</strong> Or rather, Verstappen was fast and Mercedes were furious, with the Red Bull driver leapfrogging into the lead in both championships, and a squabble of the use of flexible wings having rumbled on all week. (Christian Horner on Toto Wolff: “If I was Toto with the front wing he’s got on his car, I’d keep my mouth shut.” Wolff on horner: “Christian is a bit of a windbag who wants to be on camera.”)</p> <p><strong>Hamilton’s seventh-place finish in Monaco</strong> coupled with the retirement of Valtteri Bottas mid-race meant Mercedes also surrendered the lead in the constructors’ championship by a single point to Red Bull, and they have a task on their hand to regain first place given that Bottas has only qualified in 10th here.<br></p> <p><strong>Verstappen, flawless in Monaco,</strong> now leads Hamilton by four points – he first time he has led the title race in seven years. Much of that was down to a substandard qualifying session from Hamilton, and history seemed to be repeating itself this week – he was 11th in second practice yesterday – only for the Briton to pull off a remarkable turnaround and roar into an impressive second. It bodes well for the entertainment factor today.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-06-06T11:15:47.014Z\">at 12.15pm BST</time></p>  </div>","wordcount":"2737","firstPublicationDate":"2021-06-06T11:15:30Z","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2021-06-06T14:47:14Z","liveBloggingNow":"false","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/p/hy357","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/05832613d8c89efc19a7eaf3ccbc5a60793a410e/0_234_4645_2787/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","isLive":"true","bodyText":"And lastly, here’s our report from a day of high drama in Baku: And here’s Sebastian Vettel: “[The first ever podium] is a big deal for the team. We had a good start, made some positions and looked after our tyres. We had really good pace at the [first] restart, which was brilliant for me, giving me another two positions. We preserved the tyres well and that was the secret to the pace we had. It was a great day overall. I’m over the moon for myself and for the team, it was great. A podium - we really didn’t expect that.” Sergio Perez speaks: “Normally Baku is pretty crazy. I have to say sorry to Max, it would have been incredible to get that one-two for the team. But at the end, it was a fantastic day for us. We were close to retiring the car but luckily we managed to finish the race. This is definitely a strong boost of confidence for myself.” A helterskelter afternoon ends with Aston Martin getting their first ever F1 podium and Red Bull extending their lead in the constructors’ championship. Mercedes go home without a point. Tsunoda takes the best finish of his career so far, and Vettel enjoys his best race since Mexico 2019. But what happened to Hamilton at the restart? How they finished 1. Sergio Perez, Red Bull 2. Sebastian Vettel, Aston Martin +1.385 3. Pierre Gasly +2.762 4. Charles Leclerc, Ferrari+3.828 5. Lando Norris, McLaren +4.754 6. Fernando Alonso, Alpine +6.382 7. Yuki Tsunoda, AlphaTauri +6.624 8. Carlos Sainz, Ferrari +7.709 9. Daniel Ricciardo, McLaren +8.874 10. Kimi Raikkonen, Alfa Romeo +9.576 11.

Nicholas Latifi, Williams +42.379 2 Perez steams across the finish line as the winner, followed by the majestic Vettel and then Gasly in third. What a race! Lewis Hamilton had taken the lead after the restart when he locked up. He comes in 15th. Verstappen will be breathing a sigh of relief – he remains atop the drivers’ standings. Lap 50: Leclerc passes Gasly, Gasly passes Leclerc. Hamilton is down in 16th. Perez enters the last lap all set to win. Lap 49: Perez, Vettel, Gasly is how the current podium looks. Leclerc and Norris behind. Amazing stuff! Turn one, and Hamilton just ploughs straight on! His breaks – which were smoking on the grid – have locked up and he is out of the race! Vettel is the only driver in the top eight with a new set of tyres. He restarts in third – has he got it in him to pick off Hamilton and Perez…? Another formation lap. Perez leads the 17 drivers out of the pit lane. A minute until the restart. Hamilton has reminded his team that “it’d a marathon, not a sprint”. He’s talking about the championship. This race is very much a sprint. The restart will be a standing start. Lance Stroll is interviewed and seems suitably irked. “It was going well, we were overcutting the field and it looked a good opportunity for something big today, so it’s a shame,” he says through gritted teeth. Arthur Graves writes: “No doubt the irony of being out with a puncture then everyone else having the opportunity to change their tyres will make Verstappen smile.” Indeed. The race will resume at 18:10 local time – in 14 minutes. Leaderboard . Sergio Perez (Red Bull) . Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes) . Sebastian Vettel (Aston Martin) . Pierre Gasly (Alpha Tauri) . Charles Leclerc (Ferrari) . Yuki Tsunoda (Alpha Tauri) . Lando Norris (McLaren) . Carlos Sainz (Ferrari) . Daniel Ricciardo (McLaren) .. Fernando Alonso (Alpine) .. Kimi Raikkonen (Alfa Romeo) .. Antonio Giovinazzi (Alfa Romeo) .. Nicholas Latifi (Williams) .. Valtteri Bottas (Mercedes) .. George Russell (Williams) . Mick Schumacher (Haas) . Nikita Mazepin (Haas) As the drivers get out to stretch their legs, Perez, Hamilton and Vettel are in the podium positions – it would be Aston Martin’s first podium in F1. Meanwhile Latifi is in trouble for not coming into the pits – he was told to “stay out” by his team over the radio So then – the race has been suspended on lap 49 of 51, which leaves us with a two-lap dash for the win. Under red-flag conditions every driver is entitled to a change of tyres, so this will be a short, sharp sprint. “Have that” Incredible drama in Baku. This could alter the course of the championship. Verstappen skulks over to his team, shaking his head non-stop in a state of simmering rage. “I think it’s a tyre issue. A tyre failure,” says Horner. The red flags are out - the race will be suspended while the debris is cleared. Lap 48: Verstappen has been flawless today and will come away without a point. He boots his tyre in frustration, leaving no doubts about what happened – huge questions will be asked of Pirelli after today. This race could finish behind a safety car. Lap 47: Wow! Verstappen, coasting to victory mere seconds ago, is now out of the race, crashing on the main straight after what looks like a failure of his left rear. He clambers out of the cockpit, devastated but unharmed. Perez escapes in the lead and the safety cars is deployed. Lap 46: Five laps to go and the imperious Verstappen leads by a heady 4.4sec, followed by Perez, Hamilton, Vettel (4.5sec behind third) and Gasly. Lap 44: Tsunoda sits in seventh and has had a good race today having crashed in qualifying. Another fastest lap for Hamilton . Lap 43: “Can’t get any closer,” says Hamilton, languishing a second behind Perez in third. This is all set to be a very glorious day indeed for Red Bull. Lap 41: Verstappen has never finished in the top three in Baku, nor even led a lap. He is dominant out in front with 10 laps to go, 4secs ahead of Perez. George Russell, meanwhile, is within 2secs of Valtteri Bottas. Lap 40: “That’s not possible! What the…? squawked Gasly as Vettel went past him. Hamilton sets a new fastest lap. Lap 39: Hamilton has DRS on Perez. He thinks about attacking on the inside but decides against it. Perez stays strong. Lap 38: Bottas, a middling ninth at the restart, has dropped four places to 13th on a miserable afternoon for him. Raikkonen and Alonso have both coasted past him. Lap 35: Perez and Verstappen weave their way to the restart, at which point Verstappen steams away. Vettel attacks the inside of Leclec, who has locked up, then picks off Gasly for fourth! Verstappen has established a 2sec leads on Perez. Lap 34: Pit lane entry is open, and Alonso heads in for some softs. None of the leading cars elect to pit. Lap 33: Stroll’s race is over – he gets a pat on the back from his dad Laurence and seems shaken up but fine. This is will probably be a long safety car period. Lap 32: “Woah, woah, woah, woah,” said Stroll. “Red flag, get me out of this place on the track. Got a puncture.” The medical car picks him up. Lap 32: Big accident. Lance Stroll loses control on the start-finish straight and hits the wall, scattering debris all over the track. The safety car is deployed. Stroll seems OK. Lap 29: Still no joy for Bottas, who is stuck in 10th behind Lando Norris. “If you don’t overtake, we’re going to finish 10th or ninth,” he is told over the radio. Unarguable logic. Lap 27: It’s been plain sailing so far for Verstappen, who clocks up a fastest lap and leads by 6secs. Meanwhile Hamilton is losing more time back in third – he’s 2.5secs behind Perez. Lap 26: Sainz is closing in on his countryman and mentor Fernando Alonso. He’s within a second of the man in 12th place and will surely attack him soon. Lap 24: “Losing ground,” says Hamilton over his team radio – he has dropped back a bit from the two Red Bulls out in front. Lap 24: Bottas comes off the track trying to overtake Norris but he’s back on quickly and the yellow flags go away. Just behind him, Sainz overtakes Giovinazzi for 13th.

Lap 19: Not long, it turns out – he steers into the pits and emerges in a handy seventh, behind Leclerc and ahead of Tsunoda. Verstappen now leads by 3.5secs. Lap 17: As Hamilton sets a new fastest lap, Bottas is still stuck in 10th. Verstappen in second has opened up a 1.9sec advantage over team-mate Perez. Meanwhile Vettel is enjoying himself up in first place, but how long will his tyres last? This from the well-travelled Gary Naylor: Lap 16: Perez means business here: he puts in a new fastest lap on his new tyres. Lap 15: So Sebastian Vettel now leads on the track, albeit without having pitted. Lance Stroll is another who has resisted pitting – he’s just behind Hamilton in fifth. Lap 14: After a blistering start to the race, Perez pits from the lead – but it takes a lengthy 4.3secs, his good work undone. He comes out in second place ahead of Hamilton, Verstappen leading. Hamilton fixes his sights on Perez. Lap 13: Hamilton might regret that, losing at least two seconds in a laboured pit stop: 4.6secs. Verstappen heads into the pits a lap later and Red Bull get it done in 1.9secs, and emerges ahead of his rival Lap 12: Yellow flag in Sector 2. Sainz’s Ferrari has gone into the run-off area. And Hamilton swerves into the pits – Verstappen and Perez stay out. Lap 11: Hamilton isn’t happy with his tyres. “A real struggle with the rear,” he tells his team – and his pace is dropping. Lap 10: Lewis Hamilton is 1.2secs ahead of Verstappen, with Perez another 1.8secs back. And Leclerc, whose good qualifying work was undone so quickly, pits from fourth. Hard tyres go on. Lap 9: Alonso responds to being overtaken by heading into the pits. So does Norris, with both swapping to the hard compound tyre. Lap 8: Perez is up to third – Leclerc drops out of the podium places! – and Bottas is toiling back in 10th. “I think Hamilton is struggling a little bit with balance,” Verstappen is told. Lap 7: Verstappen bides his time, and then pounces, reeling in Leclerc to take second. Sonoda (sixth career race) steams past Alonso (317) going into turn one. Lap 5: Hamilton is just under a second ahead of Leclerc, who is making it difficult for Verstappen to overtake him for second. But Hamilton can’t pull away to escape the DRS threat. Lap 4: Ocon has retired with engine problems – “I lost power, lost power,” he wails. Giovinazzi has also been into the pits, swapping to the hard tyre Lap 3: And Hamilton wastes no time in claiming the lead, using the slipstream to attack Leclerc and roar past him! Norris, meanwhile, has dropped to 13th after a bad start. Lap 2: Giovinazzi has gained five places, Russell has pitted to swap to hard compound tyres. The drivers screech down the 138 meters into turn one – a nerveless Leclerc holds his lead, Hamilton behind him, with Verstappen and then Perez who has jumped two places by the time he’s out of turn three, picking off Sainz and Gasly. Verstappen has been given permission to change his starting tyres – he is still on used softs but they are fresher than those of the two men ahead of him. The drivers head off on the formation lap. The pre-race formalities today include a moment of silence in memory of Ojjeh and Max Mosley. Here’s our obituary of the latter: And how about some pre-race reading? Our report from yesterday’s chaotic qualifying session: How they stand: The drivers 1 Max Verstappen (Red Bull) 2 Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes) 3 Lando Norris (McLaren) 4 Valtteri Bottas (Mercedes) 5 Sergio Perez (Red Bull) 6 Charles Leclerc (Ferrari) 7 Carlos Sainz (Ferrari) 8 Daniel Ricciardo (McLaren) 9 Pierre Gasly (Alphatauri) 10 Esteban Ocon (Renault) The constructors 1 Red Bull 149 2 Mercedes 148 3 McLaren 80 4 Ferrari 78 5 Aston Martin 19 Lando Norris reckons his three-place grid penalty, for failing to pit immediately after a red flag, is unfair. It was reduced from the usual five places because Norris had “a very short time to react” it nonetheless moves him from sixth to ninth. “[I’m] a bit gutted,” he said. “I didn’t feel like I did anything wrong. I felt [it] was the safest thing to do. It’s a bad decision or an unfair penalty.” Sad news from the F1 world: McLaren chief executive Zac Brown says: “Mansour has been etched into the heart and soul of this team for nearly 40 years and was intrinsic to its success. He was a true racer in every sense.” So, after coming seventh and 11th in practice sessions on Friday, what exactly changed for Hamilton’s car in the lead-up to qualifying yesterday? Any suspicions of sandbagging were put to bed by Toto Wolff’s account of “a really thorough engineering programme and we were not shy of trying extreme things, which were as extreme as we [have ever] experienced”. Hamilton elaborated: ““We did some changes overnight which didn’t rectify it. We tried a few different things in P3 and then tried something right at the end and it unlocked the set-up. We hadn’t been able to get the tyres to switch on like the other cars and the difference was all of sudden the tyres started working and we were back in the game. It’s the biggest jump we have been able to make between P3 and quali. It was literally night and day with the car. It’s a bit overwhelming and we are in for a much different race than we anticipated.” There’s nothing like a bit of misery to spur you on to greatness. Charles Leclerc was heartbroken in his home town of Monaco last week, unable to join the grid after taking pole in qualifying – but has responded in Baku with another perfectly judged lap to claim his place at the front of today’s grid. Meanwhile Lewis Hamilton, overtaken in the title race after a middling display in Monaco, has come out swinging in Azerbaijan. He left it late, though, enduring some disastrous practice sessions before screeching into second place in yesterday’s crash-strewn qualifying session, just ahead of Max Verstappen, the man who has overtaken him in the standings. Last week was fast and furious. Or rather, Verstappen was fast and Mercedes were furious, with the Red Bull driver leapfrogging into the lead in both championships, and a squabble of the use of flexible wings having rumbled on all week. (Christian Horner on Toto Wolff: “If I was Toto with the front wing he’s got on his car, I’d keep my mouth shut.” Wolff on horner: “Christian is a bit of a windbag who wants to be on camera.”) Hamilton’s seventh-place finish in Monaco coupled with the retirement of Valtteri Bottas mid-race meant Mercedes also surrendered the lead in the constructors’ championship by a single point to Red Bull, and they have a task on their hand to regain first place given that Bottas has only qualified in 10th here. Verstappen, flawless in Monaco, now leads Hamilton by four points – he first time he has led the title race in seven years. Much of that was down to a substandard qualifying session from Hamilton, and history seemed to be repeating itself this week – he was 11th in second practice yesterday – only for the Briton to pull off a remarkable turnaround and roar into an impressive second. It bodes well for the entertainment factor today.","charCount":"15740","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/alex-hess\">Alex Hess</a>"},{"headline":"Pérez wins dramatic Azerbaijan GP after Verstappen crash and Hamilton blunder","standfirst":"<ul><li>Pérez takes advantage of late restart to take victory</li><li>Hamilton and Verstappen both fail to score a point</li></ul>","trailText":"Sergio Pérez won the Azerbaijan Grand Prix after late drama saw both Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen fail to score a point","byline":"Giles Richards","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c1df608152fc70f933f4f2db0bbb524e55936b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c1df608152fc70f933f4f2db0bbb524e55936b7/0_66_4785_2872/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lewis Hamilton locks up under pressure from Sergio Pérez into the first corner after the restart following a red flag\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lewis Hamilton locks up under pressure from Sergio Pérez into the first corner after the restart following a red flag.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clive Rose/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Sergio Pérez won the Azerbaijan Grand Prix at the Baku City circuit after late drama saw both title protagonists Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen fail to score a point.

Cesar de Melero was DJing in the Ars Studio club in Barcelona when someone told him that the artist Keith Haring was outside but the doorman wouldn’t let him in.</p> <p>“The place was packed, so I put on a record and pushed through the crowd,” De Melero told the Guardian. “And there he was with his saintly, innocent face and I told the doorman to let him in and I said to the boss: ‘Champagne for Keith Haring.’”</p> <p>And so began a brief but intense friendship during which Haring painted a mural inside De Melero’s DJ cabin. The club closed in 1992, since when it has been a billiard hall. The Haring mural remains, unspoilt and half-forgotten, just where he painted it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"05edb47bc25a26c7df00b17b4c08020becb046b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/05edb47bc25a26c7df00b17b4c08020becb046b3/0_0_600_614/489.jpg\" alt=\"A polaroid of Haring painting the mural in the Ars Studio club, Barcelona, in 1989.\" width=\"489\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Polaroid of Haring painting the mural in the Ars Studio club, Barcelona, in 1989.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: César de Melero</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now the owners plan to demolish the building to build a care home for elderly people and the destination of the Haring is up for grabs.</p> <p>“If it wasn’t for me, it would have disappeared under a coat of paint,” said Gabriel Carral, who runs the billiard hall.</p> <p>Carral claims there is a clause in the rental agreement that gives him the right to the art on the walls. He said the Haring has been valued at €80,000 and that the Keith Haring Foundation is willing to pay for the complicated business of removing it. Carral said he hasn’t decided whether to sell or donate it to the foundation.</p> <p>To De Melero, all this talk is unseemly and out of keeping with the spirit of openness and generosity with which the mural was painted. He was a fan of Haring’s work, which was part of the graffiti and acid house music subculture of the time.</p> <p>“I liked him before I met him and even more when I did,” he said. “He was such a normal and likable person, not at all vain.”</p> <p>That night in the club he showed the artist a Frisbee that was allegedly official Haring merchandise but the artist said he’d never authorised it. So he painted it with some of his trademark figures and wrote: “This is a real Keith Haring painted on a fake.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"485c0d74f4facb31512533012c3f46b8f22c952c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/485c0d74f4facb31512533012c3f46b8f22c952c/0_0_4128_3096/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A CD featuring a copy of the artwork that Haring painted on César de Melero’s frisbee.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A CD featuring a copy of the artwork that Haring painted on Cesar de Melero’s Frisbee.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: César de Melero</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Haring was in Barcelona at the behest of Montse Guillén, a chef at the Internacional Tapas Bar &amp; Restaurant in the Tribeca district of Manhattan. The bar was a cool hangout in the 1980s, frequented by artists such as Andy Warhol and Haring, as well as musicians, among them Grace Jones and David Byrne.</p> <p>The morning after that night in the club, De Melero, who is now a top DJ in Ibiza, accompanied Haring to the Plaça Salvador Seguí in el Raval, a known hangout for junkies and prostitutes, where Haring painted a mural on a building that was scheduled for demolition.</p> <p>The mural depicts a snake devouring all before it, under the slogan: “Together we can stop Aids.” Haring died a year later of Aids-related complications.</p> <p>De Melero, who videoed the event, wrote the slogan in Spanish, <em>Todos juntos podemos parar el sida</em>, on a piece of paper for Haring to copy.</p> <p>“The very next day people had drawn penises, graffiti, all sorts of crap on the mural,” De Melero recalls. “No one cared that it was a Keith Haring, people wanted food or drugs or whatever.

Cesar de Melero was DJing in the Ars Studio club in Barcelona when someone told him that the artist Keith Haring was outside but the doorman wouldn’t let him in. “The place was packed, so I put on a record and pushed through the crowd,” De Melero told the Guardian. “And there he was with his saintly, innocent face and I told the doorman to let him in and I said to the boss: ‘Champagne for Keith Haring.’” And so began a brief but intense friendship during which Haring painted a mural inside De Melero’s DJ cabin. The club closed in 1992, since when it has been a billiard hall. The Haring mural remains, unspoilt and half-forgotten, just where he painted it. Now the owners plan to demolish the building to build a care home for elderly people and the destination of the Haring is up for grabs. “If it wasn’t for me, it would have disappeared under a coat of paint,” said Gabriel Carral, who runs the billiard hall. Carral claims there is a clause in the rental agreement that gives him the right to the art on the walls. He said the Haring has been valued at €80,000 and that the Keith Haring Foundation is willing to pay for the complicated business of removing it. Carral said he hasn’t decided whether to sell or donate it to the foundation. To De Melero, all this talk is unseemly and out of keeping with the spirit of openness and generosity with which the mural was painted. He was a fan of Haring’s work, which was part of the graffiti and acid house music subculture of the time. “I liked him before I met him and even more when I did,” he said. “He was such a normal and likable person, not at all vain.” That night in the club he showed the artist a Frisbee that was allegedly official Haring merchandise but the artist said he’d never authorised it. So he painted it with some of his trademark figures and wrote: “This is a real Keith Haring painted on a fake.” Haring was in Barcelona at the behest of Montse Guillén, a chef at the Internacional Tapas Bar &amp; Restaurant in the Tribeca district of Manhattan. The bar was a cool hangout in the 1980s, frequented by artists such as Andy Warhol and Haring, as well as musicians, among them Grace Jones and David Byrne. The morning after that night in the club, De Melero, who is now a top DJ in Ibiza, accompanied Haring to the Plaça Salvador Seguí in el Raval, a known hangout for junkies and prostitutes, where Haring painted a mural on a building that was scheduled for demolition. The mural depicts a snake devouring all before it, under the slogan: “Together we can stop Aids.” Haring died a year later of Aids-related complications. De Melero, who videoed the event, wrote the slogan in Spanish, Todos juntos podemos parar el sida, on a piece of paper for Haring to copy. “The very next day people had drawn penises, graffiti, all sorts of crap on the mural,” De Melero recalls. “No one cared that it was a Keith Haring, people wanted food or drugs or whatever. He knew that when he painted it, that it was all going to be demolished anyway. He didn’t have a problem with that.” A copy of the original has been preserved at MACBA, the city’s contemporary art museum. That night, Haring reappeared at the Ars Studio and asked De Melero to move his records away from the wall because he wanted to paint. With the same red paint with which he painted the mural earlier that day, he depicted a figure apparently vibrating to the music. “The head is a flower, which is a reference to flower power, and the A is for acid house,” De Melero explained. “This painting should stay where it is. First it was in a night club, then a billiard hall, now a care home. Why not?” A spokesperson for Barcelona council said: “We have guaranteed the mural’s protection under the special urban plan and have asked the Generalitat [Catalan regional government] to declare it as part of our cultural heritage.” De Melero disparages talk of the painting’s economic value. “Haring didn’t paint it for money, he did it as a mark of friendship, and out of love for the club and for Barcelona,” he said, adding that no one can claim ownership of the work. As Haring himself once remarked: “Art is for everybody.”","charCount":"4197","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/stephen-burgen\">Stephen Burgen</a> in Barcelona"}]

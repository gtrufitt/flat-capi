The update brings the total number of cases from the latest outbreak in Melbourne to 35. A record 56,624 tests were conducted in the 24 hours to Saturday morning, surpassing the previous day’s record of 47,462 tests. On Saturday, the state’s Covid testing commander, Jeroen Weimar, said four of the new cases were linked to a person who tested positive on Friday. The Victorian health minister, Martin Foley, said the person was a food distribution delivery driver who visited “multiple stores and grocery sites across metropolitan Melbourne on 18 and 19 May”. There are now more than 150 exposure sites and more than 15,000 primary and secondary contacts who must self-isolate after coming into potential contact with a person with Covid-19. Foley said the individual “worked during their infectious period” but they “showed no signs of Covid symptoms themselves”. He also thanked the food distribution company and customers for working with contact tracers. Weimar said four of the new cases announced on Saturday were household contacts of the delivery driver, including a student at Mount Ridley college in Craigieburn. He said these four people had only been in isolation for one day. The fifth case was separate, and was an employee of firm Stratton Finance who became infected at a display home in Mickleham. Late on Friday the Victorian health department announced new tier 1 exposure sites, including the Preston city hall, which is a vaccination centre. The health department said a potentially infectious person visited the hall for a flu vaccination on 22 May between 9.30am and 11am. The new list of tier 1 sites – where people are most at risk of catching and spreading the virus – includes Sabrini Foods in Carrum Downs, Dosa Hut in Craigieburn, Spice Inn Groceries in Dandenong, Bestway supermarket in Dandenong, Marmara Halal Meats in Dandenong and Epping Spices &amp; Nuts Grocery Store at various times between the 19 and 25 May. Other tier 1 sites include the Telstra Shop on Clarendon Street in South Melbourne, Hunky Dory Fish &amp; Chips in South Melbourne, the Clarendon Centre public toilets, the Miss China noodle bar in the Clarendan Centre, a 7-Eleven in Thomastown North, and Erol’s Fruit Shop in Wollert. A JB Hi-Fi and a Good Guys in Maribyrnong and Dan Murphy’s Brunswick East were added as tier 2 exposure sites. A full list of exposure sites can be found here. Foley announced what he called a “hat-trick of records”, as the state administered a record number of tests and vaccinations over the past three days. Of the five new local cases on Saturday, he said four were associated with the city of Whittlesea and one was linked to the Port Melbourne workplace outbreak. Weimar said that so far there was “no evidence of transmission” at the MCG or at Marvel Stadium, which were exposure sites for the Collingwood v Port Adelaide and Essendon v North Melbourne games respectively. He said 70% to 75% of close contacts identified at the MCG and Marvel Stadium had so far tested negative. Weimar said that approximately half of the vaccinations given yesterday were Pfizer and half were AstraZeneca.","charCount":"3317","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/naaman-zhou\">Naaman Zhou</a>"},{"headline":"Taliban threaten Afghan security guards who work for Australian embassy in Kabul","standfirst":"<p>Guards say their work for Australia has made them and their families targets for retribution</p>","trailText":"Guards say their work for Australia has made them and their families targets for retribution","byline":"Ben Doherty","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97df7b12c1b3d9bcec46b5619a73a7d8b7b0a9ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97df7b12c1b3d9bcec46b5619a73a7d8b7b0a9ee/0_210_3900_2341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An Afghan security guard near the Australian embassy in Kabul.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Afghans who work as security guards at Australia’s embassy in Kabul fear for their lives after the Taliban threatened retribution for them working for foreign governments. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wakil Kohsar/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>The Taliban have publicly threatened Afghan security guards who have worked for the soon-to-be-shut Australian embassy, circulating pictures of them online and warning they would be targeted for cooperating with a foreign government.</p> <p>The Australian government announced this week that it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/may/25/australia-to-close-kabul-embassy-this-week-ahead-of-troop-withdrawal-from-afghanistan\">shutting its embassy in Kabul</a>, citing “an increasingly uncertain security environment” and saying its diplomats would not be safe “in light of the imminent international military withdrawal from Afghanistan”.</p> <p>Afghan nationals employed on contract by the Australian government as security guards at the Kabul embassy say their work – highly visible, standing outside the embassy compound – has made them targets for Taliban retribution, and many say they will not be safe inside Afghanistan.</p> <p>The Taliban have openly said anyone who has worked for or alongside foreign governments or military forces is a traitor and an enemy and will be targeted.</p> <p>The US military has said it is working “rapidly” to develop plans to evacuate interpreters and other staff – up to 18,000 – who worked alongside American troops.

The Australian government announced this week that it was shutting its embassy in Kabul, citing “an increasingly uncertain security environment” and saying its diplomats would not be safe “in light of the imminent international military withdrawal from Afghanistan”. Afghan nationals employed on contract by the Australian government as security guards at the Kabul embassy say their work – highly visible, standing outside the embassy compound – has made them targets for Taliban retribution, and many say they will not be safe inside Afghanistan. The Taliban have openly said anyone who has worked for or alongside foreign governments or military forces is a traitor and an enemy and will be targeted. The US military has said it is working “rapidly” to develop plans to evacuate interpreters and other staff – up to 18,000 – who worked alongside American troops. But other allied countries have not made similar announcements. The Guardian has seen several posts online threatening Afghans who have worked at the Australian embassy. One, which has a picture of the guards protesting outside the diplomatic compound this week, carries the message, written in Pashto: “Interpreters and security guards gathered in front of the Australian embassy in Kabul to seek asylum from the Australian government. “They had no idea that one day the doors of the embassy would be closed and they would be held accountable to the people.” One guard said guards at embassies of countries with troops in Afghanistan regularly faced death threats from the Taliban, made against them, their children and families. Previously, security guards employed as “contractors” to provide security for the Australian embassy were not eligible for the Australian government’s locally engaged employee humanitarian resettlement scheme, open to other directly employed staff, such as interpreters. Security guards were told specifically: “The following Afghan nationals will not be eligible for resettlement under this policy: people who worked with Dfat as part of their duties as an employee of a private security company.” However, this week that advice was changed, and correspondence from the foreign affairs and trade department, seen by Guardian Australia, said “contractors and security staff can also apply for the locally engaged staff humanitarian visa”. Guards say they welcome being allowed to apply under the scheme, but with processing times running often beyond five years, they fear it will be too slow. They say the sudden closure of the embassy has left them exposed to insurgent violence, and feeling abandoned by the country they risked their lives for. One guard, who the Guardian has chosen not to name for security reasons, said guards would be targeted and killed by the Taliban when foreign troops leave. “We are not going out from home, the kids have stopped school, all because of threat to our lives,” he said. “We feel good about our work for Australia and we are still proud of Australia. So they won’t turn their back on us.

Dfat did not respond to questions about its proposed resettlement of security and other staff. With US and its coalition forces leaving Afghanistan by September, the prospects for Afghanistan are bleak. A resurgent and emboldened Taliban have control of significant swathes of the country, and threatens much more. “The Taliban is likely to make gains on the battlefield,” and the prospects for a peace deal are “low”, a US intelligence report said. Chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Gen Mark Milley, said this week the US was “rapidly” making plans to evacuate Afghan citizens who had worked for the US military, ahead of September’s troop pullout. Milley said it was important the US “remain faithful to those who had supported the war effort … and that we do what is necessary to ensure their protection and, if necessary, get them out of the country”. “There are plans being developed very, very rapidly here, not just interpreters but a lot of other people that have worked with the United States.” In Kabul, there is a lack of certainty over the immediate future of Australia’s embassy.

Gavin Newsom on Friday announced the pardons for Bounchan Keola, 39, and Kao Saelee, 41, who were both sent to US immigration authorities last year after spending decades in prison for teenage convictions and had battled wildfires as incarcerated firefighters. Both men told their stories to the Guardian from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) jails last fall, prompting national outrage about their potential deportation to Laos, a country their families had fled as refugees decades ago. “I could never have imagined this would happen,” Saelee told the Guardian by phone after learning the news. Saelee, who was two years old when his family left Laos, spent 22 years in prison for a robbery when he was a teen, and after completing his sentence was transferred to Ice for deportation. He was released from an Ice jail last week and came home to his family in the Fresno, California, area, reuniting for the first time in decades. Keola spent more than two decades in prison after he was prosecuted as an adult at age 16 and accepted a plea deal in a second-degree attempted murder case. At the end of his sentence last year, he served on the frontlines of massive wildfires as part of an inmate firefighting program. He was hit by a fallen tree and suffered a near-fatal injury. Instead of returning to his family in the Bay Area after serving his sentence, the prison transferred Keola directly to Ice while he was still recovering from his serious injuries. Newsom called Keola on Friday to deliver the news. “I thought somebody was trying to prank me, but [the governor] said, ‘Thank you for your service as a firefighter and keep up the good work,’” Keola told the Guardian after the call. “This is all I wanted – a second chance to live this American life,” he added. “We came to this country to have a better life.” Keola is of Khmu descent, an ethnic minority, and had escaped the country after the Vietnam war. Saelee is of Mien descent, a minority that also faced persecution after the war. Newsom’s pardons mean both men will no longer face deportation threats, can return to being legal permanent residents, can get work authorization and eventually apply for citizenship, said Anoop Prasad, a staff attorney with the Asian Law Caucus, who has represented both men. “It’s a huge relief, and I’m incredibly happy for Kao and Boun and their families who for the last year have been constantly worried that they would be permanently separated,” Prasad said. “I’m glad Governor Newsom was able to see that they are more than their convictions from when they were teenagers, and I hope he sees the same is true for so many people inside prison,” he added. With the clemency grant, Keola said he was hopeful he could now serve as a licensed firefighter. Advocates have also been pressing Newsom to end his practice of voluntarily transferring people from state prisons to immigration, calling it a form of double punishment. It’s a policy that continues to lead to deportations of refugees under Biden. After Saelee and Keola spoke out, state lawmakers across California called for Newsom to pardon them and pushed for legislation that would end the transfers and protect people from deportation.","charCount":"3390","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/sam-levin\">Sam Levin</a> in Los Angeles"},{"headline":"Senate Republicans block commission to investigate deadly Capitol attack – as it happened","standfirst":"<ul><li>Republicans block creation of 9/11-style January 6 commission</li><li>Democrats fail to win 60 votes needed to break a Senate filibuster</li><li>‘Shame on the Republican party,’ says majority leader Schumer</li></ul>","trailText":"‘Shame on the Republican party,’ says majority leader Chuck Schumer – follow the latest politics news","byline":"Sam Levin in Los Angeles (now) and Joan E Greve in Washington (earlier)","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b576c409f8a21b2cabb62dfaf019d6809c5d6f05\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b576c409f8a21b2cabb62dfaf019d6809c5d6f05/0_150_4500_2701/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The bill would have formed a bipartisan commission to study the Capitol insurrection of 6 January – but the effort is now dead.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The bill would have formed a bipartisan commission to study the Capitol insurrection of 6 January – but the effort is now dead.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Corum/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<div id=\"block-60b17de38f088d8c3178c74e\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-05-29T00:06:18.619Z\">1.06am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>That’s all for today, thanks for following along and have a nice three-day weekend.

Biden has also been forced to limit his infrastructure bill to $1.7tn, down from his originally proposed $2.2tn initiative. So, the chances of getting GOP support for such a budget are slim. </p> <p>Biden’s two-part initiative to revitalize the US economy is rooted in ramping up its flagging infrastructure and broadening its social safety net. These initiatives would cause the US to have yearly deficits of more than $1.3tn over the next 10 years, with debt increasing to 117% of the value of economic output before 2031.</p> <p>Biden’s plan would be funded, in part, by increasing taxes on corporations and the extremely wealthy.

Here are some key links from the day: Biden set out a $6tn budget proposal that, if passed, would fund a sweeping overhaul of US infrastructure and pour money into education and climate action, while driving government spending to its highest sustained levels since the second world war. Senate Republicans blocked the creation of a special commission to study the deadly 6 January attack on the Capitol, dashing hopes for a bipartisan panel amid a Republican push to put the violent insurrection by Trump’s supporters behind them. Sewage sludge that wastewater treatment districts across America package and sell as home fertilizer contain alarming levels of toxic PFAS, also known as “forever chemicals”, a new report has revealed. San Jose residents mourned after the deadliest shooting in the region’s history, saying, “We can’t sweep this under the rug.” A Guardian analysis revealed that at least 70% of people charged in the Capitol riot have been released as they wait for trial. Kamala Harris became the first woman to deliver the Naval Academy commencement address earlier today. For the first time in nearly 30 years, a US president has released a budget that doesn’t ban federal funding for abortion. A judge said on Friday that he will appoint a “special master” to protect attorney-client privilege during a review of materials seized from Rudy Giuliani. Biden released a statement condemning the recent rise in anti-Semitic attacks across the country. A gunman who killed nine of his co-workers at a rail yard in San Jose, California, had stockpiled weapons and ammunition at his home, including 12 guns and 22,000 rounds of ammunition, authorities said on Friday. Investigators found the cache of weapons at the home of Samuel James Cassidy, the Santa Clara county sheriff’s office said in a news release. They also turned up multiple cans of gasoline and suspected molotov cocktails. Authorities have said that Cassidy set his house on fire using a timer or slow-burn device to coincide with his attack. The guns he used to open fire on his co-workers appear to be legal, officials said. They have not said how he obtained them. The nine victims in the worst mass shooting in the region have been identified as: Paul Delacruz Megia, 42; Taptejdeep Singh, 36; Adrian Balleza, 29; Jose Dejesus Hernandez III, 35; Timothy Michael Romo, 49; Michael Joseph Rudometkin, 40; Abdolvahab Alaghmandan, 63, Lars Kepler Lane, 63; and Alex Ward Fritch, 49. The US Post Office announced today that it is increasing the price of a first-class postage stamp – from 55 cents to 58 cents – in an effort to offset declining revenues, Reuters reports. Mail volume has decreased 28% in the last ten years, USPS said in a statement. The rates for international letters and postcards will also increase later this summer. The postmaster general, Louis DeJoy, is working to erase $160bn in projected liabilities over the next decade. More details on the changes here: Joe Biden’s proposed 2022 budget removes a ban on federal funding for most abortions that has been included in government spending bills for decades, Reuters reports. The budget, released today, omits any mention of the Hyde amendment, which was first passed in 1976, and has been included in spending bills since. That change, however, is not likely to get through the Senate: The longstanding amendment restricts abortion coverage for recipients of Medicare, Medicaid, federal employees, service members and Washington DC residents. It could still be added to a later spending bill. Advocates celebrated: The move comes at a time when the anti-abortion movement in the US is emboldened and looking forward to a supreme court case directly challenging the laws underpinning the right to abortion in the US. More here from the Guardian’s health reporter, Jessica Glenza: The Biden administration is working to “dramatically reshape” the way asylum seekers are processed, in an effort to prevent a growing backlog of immigration court cases, BuzzFeed News reported, citing government documents. The changes could cut the waiting period by years for some applicants, according to reporter Hamed Aleaziz. The new policy, which is not finalized yet, would give asylum officers the power to decide cases instead of immigration judges in certain instances. The Trump administration overhauled the asylum process in significant ways, creating more obstacles for migrants seeking protection in the US. From the draft Biden policy cited in the report: If there is any area of agreement on immigration, it is that the system for dealing with asylum claims at the border is ‘overwhelmed’ and in desperate need of repair. A system that takes years to get to a result is not a working system. It is unfair to those who need protection, and it encourages abuse by those undeserving of protection and the smugglers who exploit dysfunction for profit. The aim of this rule is to begin urgently replacing a broken system with a more efficient one, adjudicating asylum claims expeditiously without [compromising] fairness.” The CDC has released new guidelines for children’s summer camps, saying unvaccinated kids generally do not have to wear masks outside, except for activities that involve sustained close contact: “Camp programs should encourage people who are not fully vaccinated and those who might need extra precautions to wear a mask consistently and correctly,” the CDC said, explaining: Indoors. Mask use indoors is strongly encouraged for people who are not fully vaccinated including children. No child under the age of 2 should wear a mask. Outdoors. In general, people do not need to wear masks when outdoors. However, particularly in areas of substantial to high transmission, people who are not fully vaccinated are encouraged to wear a mask in crowded outdoor settings or during activities that involve sustained close contact with other people who are not fully vaccinated. More info here: A federal judge is appointing a “special master” to protect attorney-client privilege during a review of materials seized from Rudy Giuliani and another attorney who has represented Donald Trump, the AP reports: The judge rejected efforts by Giuliani and lawyer Victoria Toensing to force prosecutors to divulge more about why they seized electronic devices on 28 April. Prosecutors made the unusual request for the appointment of a lawyer or “special master” to protect attorney-client privilege the day after the raids, citing the need to make it clear that materials were reviewed appropriately. Prosecutors are examining Giuliani’s interactions with Ukrainian figures and whether he violated a law governing lobbying on behalf of foreign countries or entities. Prosecutors later revealed that the FBI had successfully downloaded 11 devices belonging to Giuliani and returned them to him. My colleague Abené Clayton spent time in San Jose yesterday where families were mourning the sudden losses of their loved ones in the Bay Area’s worst mass shooting. The shooting unfolded on Wednesday when a 57-year-old employee of the Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) walked into a facility and opened fire, killing nine of his co-workers. John Costa, the president of the union that the slain rail workers belonged to, offered words to remember the victims: Paul Delacruz Megia, 42; Taptejdeep Singh, 36; Adrian Balleza, 29; Jose Dejesus Hernandez III, 35; Timothy Michael Romo, 49; Michael Joseph Rudometkin, 40; Abdolvahab Alaghmandan, 63, Lars Kepler Lane, 63; and Alex Ward Fritch, 49. “I want to send a message that we have to honor our brothers today and not forget what happened here,” Costa said. Hi all - Sam Levin in Los Angeles here, continuing our live coverage for the rest of the day. The mother of Brian Sicknick, the Capitol police officer who died after the 6 January insurrection, has spoken out about Senate Republicans blocking the creation of a special commission to study the attack. “I don’t understand it. They are elected for us, the people, and they don’t care about that,” Gladys Sicknick told CNN after meeting with GOP senators on Thursday. “They care about money, I guess, their pocketbooks. So they’ll be in front of the cameras when they feel like it. They just don’t care, and it’s not right.” Her son was sprayed with a chemical during the insurrection, collapsed and later suffered a stroke. “I think you know it’s all talk and no action. Clearly, they’re not backing the blue,” Sandra Garza, the late officer’s girlfriend, told CNN’s Jake Tapper. “It’s just unbelievable to me that they could do nothing about this.” Republicans killed the effort to set up a 9/11-style inquiry into the attack on the Capitol by a pro-Trump mob despite broad popular support for such an investigation and pleas from the family of a Capitol police officer who collapsed and died after the siege and other officers who battled the rioters. That’s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Sam Levin, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here’s where the day stands so far: Senate Republicans blocked the bill to form a bipartisan commission to study the Capitol insurrection. The final vote on whether to start debate on the commission bill was 54-35, with six Republicans joining 48 Democrats in supporting the motion to advance the proposal. Democrats needed 60 votes to take up the bill because Republicans invoked the first official Senate filibuster of Joe Biden’s presidency to defeat the legislation. Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer condemned Republicans for preventing the commission bill from moving forward. “Shame on the Republican party for trying to sweep the horrors of that day under the rug because they’re afraid of Donald Trump,” Schumer said in a floor speech shortly after the vote concluded. Biden released his $6tn budget proposal, calling for massive investments in infrastructure, education and climate action. A president’s budget proposal is largely considered a political document that outlines the White House’s legislative priorities. However, if Biden’s budget were adopted, it would increase US government spending to the highest levels since the second world war. Biden spoke to US troops to thank them for their service ahead of the Memorial Day holiday. Speaking at the military base in Hampton, Virginia, the president expressed appreciation for the sacrifices made by service members and their families. “Simply stated, you are the backbone of the country,” Biden said. Kamala Harris became the first woman to deliver a commencement address at the US Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. The vice-president told the Naval Academy graduates, “The American people are depending on you: the best, the bravest, the most brilliant.” Sam will have more coming up, so stay tuned. The question now is not so much whether the Republican party can be saved any time in the foreseeable future. It is what Joe Biden and the Democrats should do when faced with a party determined to subvert democracy through any means necessary, including violence. On Friday Republicans in the Senate torpedoed an effort to create a bipartisan commission to investigate the deadly insurrection by Donald Trump’s supporters at the US Capitol on 6 January, deploying the procedural move known as the filibuster to stop it even being debated. Fearful perhaps of what such a commission might uncover about their own role as co-conspirators, most brushed aside personal pleas by Gladys Sicknick, the mother of a police officer who was that day sprayed with a chemical, collapsed and later had a stroke and died. “A country that cannot even agree to investigate an assault on its Capitol is in big trouble, indeed,” observed Susan Glasser in the New Yorker magazine. Joe Biden has released a statement condemning the recent rise in anti-Semitic attacks across the country. “These attacks are despicable, unconscionable, un-American, and they must stop,” the president said. “I will not allow our fellow Americans to be intimidated or attacked because of who they are or the faith they practice. “We cannot allow the toxic combination of hatred, dangerous lies, and conspiracy theories to put our fellow Americans at risk.” Biden noted that attorney general Merrick Garland has pledged to deploy all tools available to the justice department to combat hate crimes. “We must all stand together to silence these terrible and terrifying echoes of the worst chapters in world history, and pledge to give hate no safe harbor,” the president said. “Let us all take up that work and create a nation that stands for, and stands up for, the dignity and safety of all of our people.” According to the Anti-Defamation League, reports of anti-Semitic hate incidents increased by 75% during the two weeks of military conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. Over those two weeks, 222 hate incidents were reported, compared to 127 for the two-week period before that. “Many of these incidents appear to have been perpetrated by individuals scapegoating American Jews for the actions of the Israeli government,” the ADL said. Meanwhile, congressional Republicans criticized Joe Biden’s $6 trillion as a wasteful spending spree that would do little to improve Americans’ lives. “President Biden’s proposal would drown American families in debt, deficits, and inflation,” Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement. McConnell noted that Senate Republicans laid out a counteroffer to the president’s infrastructure plan yesterday, calling for investing an additional $257 billion above baseline infrastructure spending over the next eight years. (Biden has called for spending $1.7 trillion above the baseline level on infrastructure.) “If Washington Democrats can move beyond the socialist daydreams and the go-it-alone partisanship, we could get a lot of important work done for our country,” McConnell said. House speaker Nancy Pelosi praised Joe Biden’s newly announced budget as “an unequivocal declaration of the value that Democrats place on America’s workers and middle class families”. “The Biden budget makes historic investments in the American workforce and economy. It does so by seizing a once-in-a-generation opportunity to create millions of good-paying Americans jobs, supercharge America’s global competitiveness and power growth for generations to come,” the Democratic speaker said in a statement. “Congressional Democrats look forward to working with the Biden-Harris Administration to enact this visionary budget, which will pave the path to opportunity and prosperity for our nation.” The release of Biden’s budget comes as the White House continues to negotiate with Senate Republicans over an infrastructure bill, with the hope that the final proposal can attract bipartisan support in Congress. Kamala Harris delivered the commencement address this morning at the US Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. The speech made the vice-president the first woman to address the academy’s graduating class since its founding in 1845. Harris expressed confidence that the Naval Academy graduates are prepared to meet any challenge they may face in a rapidly changing world. “The American people are depending on you: the best, the bravest, the most brilliant,” the vice-president said. “Class of 2021, you are prepared for all of this. You are prepared for any threat. And you are prepared for this new era.” The Guardian’s Dominic Rushe has the latest on Biden’s $6tn budget proposal Friday: Biden’s budget would fund a dramatic overhaul of US infrastructure, and dedicate extensive funds to education and climate action—which would put government spending at its “highest sustained levels since the second world war,” Rushe explains. Importantly, Rushe points out, Biden’s first budget is “largely a political document.” While this proposal makes clear Biden’s hopes for revitalizing the US in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, Republicans are already chaffing against its scale. Indeed, no Republicans voted in favor of Biden’s $1.9tn Covid stimulus bill. Biden has also been forced to limit his infrastructure bill to $1.7tn, down from his originally proposed $2.2tn initiative. So, the chances of getting GOP support for such a budget are slim. Biden’s two-part initiative to revitalize the US economy is rooted in ramping up its flagging infrastructure and broadening its social safety net. These initiatives would cause the US to have yearly deficits of more than $1.3tn over the next 10 years, with debt increasing to 117% of the value of economic output before 2031. Biden’s plan would be funded, in part, by increasing taxes on corporations and the extremely wealthy. He supports increasing corporate taxes to 28%, up from 21%. All Republicans oppose this tax increase plan, as do some Democrats. Joe Manchin has slammed GOP senators who blocked the creation of a bipartisan commission to study the deadly Capitol insurrection on 6 January. “Choosing to put politics and political elections above the health of our Democracy is unconscionable, and the betrayal of the oath we each take is something they will have to live with,” Manchin, a Democrat senator from West Virginia, has said. “This was our chance to have a bipartisan commission that would allow for an impartial investigation into the events of that horrific day, so that we are better able to prevent another attack on our nation,” Manchin also says. Manchin tells viewers that Democratic leadership in the house and Senate accepted Republicans’ proposed changes “because a commission of this nature must be bipartisan to be successful.” He recognizes the “six brave Republicans” who favored establishing the commission, while pointing out that four more were needed to advance this legislation. Manchin, in his address, has also issued a broad apology about the commission’s failure to progress. “You deserve better, and I am sorry that my Republican colleagues and friends, let political fear prevent them from doing what they know in their hearts to be right.” Joe Biden’s remarks to troops at Joint Base Langley-Eustis have now concluded. Here’s where the day stands so far: Senate Republicans blocked consideration of the bill to form a bipartisan commission to study the Capitol insurrection. The final vote on whether to start debate on the commission bill was 54-35, with six Republicans joining 48 Democrats in supporting the motion to advance the proposal. Democrats needed 60 votes to take up the bill because Republicans invoked the first official Senate filibuster of the Biden era to defeat the legislation. Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer condemned Republicans for preventing the commission bill from moving forward. “Shame on the Republican party for trying to sweep the horrors of that day under the rug because they’re afraid of Donald Trump,” Schumer said in a floor speech shortly after the vote concluded. Biden spoke to US troops to thank them for their service ahead of the Memorial Day holiday. Speaking at the military base in Hampton, Virginia, the president expressed appreciation for the sacrifices made by service members and their families. “Simply stated, you are the backbone of the country,” Biden said. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Joe Biden delivered remarks to US troops at Joint Base Langley-Eustis in Hampton, Virginia, ahead of Memorial Day weekend. The president began his speech with an emotional retelling of how his son, Beau, decided to join the military. Beau Biden died of brain cancer in 2015. Biden said the sacrifices that his son made to join the military reminded him of the sacrifices that service members and their families make every day. “Simply stated, you are the backbone of the country,” Biden said. Jill Biden spoke at Joint Base Langley-Eustis before Joe Biden delivered his own remarks to US troops ahead of the Memorial Day holiday. The first lady, who has made supporting military families a primary focus of her work, expressed appreciation for the sacrifices of service members and their loved ones. “Our military is a community bound together by love,” the first lady said. “It’s time that our nation matches that devotion.” The stage is set at Joint Base Langley-Eustis in Hampton, Virginia, where Joe Biden will soon speak to US troops to thank them for their service ahead of Memorial Day weekend. As the Senate voted on the January 6 commission bill, Joe Biden delivered remarks on the country’s fight against coronavirus in Alexandria, Virginia. Appearing alongside Virginia Governor Ralph Northam, the president celebrated the significant progress that the state has made to limit the spread of coronavirus since he took office in January. Virginia has received more than $247 million in federal funding for community vaccination sites, and more than 1,000 pharmacies across the state have participated in the federal vaccination program. As more Virginians have gotten vaccinated, case numbers have consistently fallen in the state, with deaths and hospitalizations having decreased substantially since January. Although this progress is encouraging, Biden emphasized the importance of getting even more Virginians vaccinated in order to get the virus under control by July 4. “If we succeed, we can celebrate our independence from the virus together on the Fourth of July, as we celebrate our independence as a nation,” Biden said. “And the future is only going to get brighter.” The president and the first lady will also soon deliver remarks in Hampton, Virginia, to kick off the start of Memorial Day weekend, so stay tuned. The Guardian’s Sam Levine reports on the upcoming Senate vote on Democrats’ election reform bill: The senate will vote in about a month on sweeping legislation that would dramatically expand access to the ballot box, Chuck Schumer, the senate majority leader, said Friday. The announcement came immediately after senate Republicans blocked the creation of a bipartisan commission to probe the 6 January attack on the US capitol. Republicans used the filibuster, a procedural tactic that prevents legislation from moving ahead in the senate unless it has 60 votes. The comments from Schumer are significant because there is some handwringing over how exactly Democrats plan to get over the filibuster when it comes to passing the sweeping voting rights bill. Those conversations have become more urgent in recent weeks as Republicans have moved aggressively in state legislatures across the country to impose new restrictions. Schumer said the senate would vote on the bill during the last week of the senate’s June work period. A key senator in the vote will be Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat, who continues to back the filibuster, even as it harms his own party. Manchin has also said he wants bipartisan buy-in for the bill. After the Friday filibuster blocking the 6 January commission, Manchin tweaked Republicans for not supporting the panel. House speaker Nancy Pelosi sharply criticized Senate Republicans for blocking consideration of the January 6 commission bill. “Mitch McConnell asked Senate Republicans to do him a ‘personal favor’ and vote against the January 6th Commission,” the Democratic speaker said in a new statement. “In doing so, Mitch McConnell asked them to be complicit in his undermining of the truth of January 6th. In bowing to McConnell’s personal favor request, Republican Senators surrendered to the January 6th mob assault.” Pelosi argued the vote on the commission bill brought “shame” to the Senate and would make the country less safe. She indicated that House committees, which are under Democratic leadership, would continue to investigate the attack. “Honoring our responsibility to the Congress in which we serve and the Country which we love, Democrats will proceed to find the truth,” Pelosi said. Congresswoman Liz Cheney commended the six Republican senators who voted in favor of taking up the January 6 commission bill. “Thank you to Senators Cassidy, Collins, Murkowski, Portman, Sasse, and Romney for voting for truth and defense of our constitution,” the Republican congresswoman said on Twitter. “History will remember those who put country ahead of politics.” Cheney was ousted as House Republican conference chair earlier this month over her criticism of Donald Trump’s lies about the presidential election, which sparked the Capitol attack. Last week, Cheney voted with 34 other House Republicans and every House Democrat in support of the commission bill. Progressives are already pointing to the Republican blockade of the January 6 commission bill as evidence for why Senate Democrats should eliminate the filibuster. Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Twitter, “If Senate Republicans can block an independent commission investigating a deadly armed attack on the Capitol because it might hurt their poll numbers with insurrectionists, then something is badly wrong with the Senate. We must get rid of the filibuster to protect our democracy.” At least two Senate Democrats -- Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema -- have indicated they are still against eliminating the filibuster. Although Manchin expressed severe disappointment about today’s vote, he previously indicated he would not be willing to end the filibuster to make the commission happen. A spokesperson for Republican Senator Pat Toomey told HuffPost that he was not in Washington for the commission bill vote today because of a family obligation. However, the spokesperson said, Toomey would have voted in favor of starting debate on the bill. The Pennsylvania senator also voted to convict Donald Trump for incitement of insurrection shortly after the Capitol attack, and he had expressed openness to the commission proposal. Toomey’s “aye” vote would have made seven Republicans in support of advancing the bill, but that is still short of 10 Republican votes necessary to overcome the filibuster. Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer condemned his Republican colleagues for blocking consideration of the bill to form a bipartisan commission to study the Capitol insurrection. “Shame on the Republican Party for trying to sweep the horrors of that day under the rug because they’re afraid of Donald Trump,” Schumer said in a floor speech moments ago. This marked Senate Republicans’ first official use of the filibuster to defeat a bill, and Schumer said he hoped this was not the beginning of a trend of Republicans blocking “reasonable, common-sense legislation”. Because Republicans invoked the filibuster, Democrats needed 60 votes to take up the commission bill, and they only got 54 by the time the vote was gaveled out. The six Senate Republicans who voted with Democrats in favor of taking up the January 6 commission bill were Susan Collins, Mitt Romney, Bill Cassidy, Lisa Murkowski, Ben Sasse and Rob Portman. Two Republican senators who voted earlier this year to convict Donald Trump for incitement of insurrection, Pat Toomey and Richard Burr, were not present for the vote. Republicans have successfully blocked the Senate from taking up the bill to form a bipartisan commission to study the Capitol insurrection. The final vote was 54-35, with six Republicans joining 48 Democrats in supporting the motion to advance the bill. Eleven senators did not participate in the vote. Democrats needed 10 of their Republican colleagues to join them in order to break the filibuster and take up the commission bill, but they fell short of that. The January 6 commission is dead -- for now, at least. Senator Joe Manchin told reporters that he was “very disappointed” about the likely defeat of the January 6 commission bill. “Politics has trumped - literally and figuratively - the good of the country,” the Democratic senator said, according to a Wall Street Journal reporter. Republicans will likely be able to defeat the commission bill because of the 60-vote threshold needed to overcome a Senate filibuster. But Manchin has continued to defend the filibuster, saying he is unwilling to eliminate it, even if it means the commission will not happen. Rob Portman of Ohio has become the sixth Republican senator to vote in favor of taking up the January 6 commission bill. Portman voted to acquit Donald Trump in his impeachment trial earlier this year, but the senator acknowledged the former president had “encouraged the mob” to attack the Capitol on January 6. Democrats need four more Republicans to join them in order to overcome a filibuster of the commission bill. Two more Republican senators, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Ben Sasse of Nebraska, have voted in favor of taking up the January 6 commission bill. That makes five Republicans total who have voted with Democrats so far, but it remains unlikely that five more Republicans will join them. Because of the Republican filibuster, 60 votes are needed just to start the Senate debate over the January 6 commission bill. Only three Republicans -- Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Susan Collins of Maine and Mitt Romney of Massachusetts -- have voted in favor of advancing the bill so far. It seems very unlikely that seven more Republicans will join Democrats in voting to take up the bill, so the proposal will almost certainly be defeated. Before the vote began, Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer pleaded with his colleagues to support the January 6 commission bill. “This commission is desperately needed,” the Democratic leader said. “If our Republican friends vote against this, I would ask them: what are you afraid of? The truth?” Schumer argued Donald Trump’s lies about widespread fraud in the presidential election had “eroded” American democracy and the commission was necessary to rebut those lies. “This is not a Democratic or Republican obligation. This is an American obligation,” Schumer said. The Senate is now holding a procedural vote on the bill to create a bipartisan commission to study the Capitol insurrection. The bill is not likely to advance, as only a handful of Republicans have indicated they will support the proposal and Democrats need 60 votes to break a filibuster. The Senate has reached an agreement to delay final consideration of the Endless Frontier Act until after the Memorial Day holiday. The upper chamber will now shift focus to a procedural vote on the bill to form a bipartisan commission to study the Capitol insurrection, as well as votes on two of Joe Biden’s nominees. Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer said moments ago that the commission bill vote will occur sometime in the next hour. Republicans are expected to defeat the bill, as Democrats will need 60 votes to overcome a filibuster of the proposal. The Senate vote on the January 6 commission bill may actually happen sooner rather than later, with a potential deal between Democrats and Republicans in the works. According to multiple reports, Republicans are discussing the possibility of delaying final passage of the Endless Frontier Act until after Memorial Day weekend. If Democrats agree to that, then the Senate will vote on the commission bill and two of Joe Biden’s nominations before leaving for the holiday weekend. However, it’s still unclear if Democrats will be on board, as they wanted to wrap up the Endless Frontier Act before going into recess. Stay tuned. Guardian staff and agencies report: The state-backed Russian cyber spies behind the SolarWinds hacking campaign launched a targeted phishing assault on US and foreign government agencies and thinktanks this week using an email marketing account of the US Agency for International Development (USAid), Microsoft has said. The effort targeted about 3,000 email accounts at more than 150 different organisations, at least a quarter of them involved in international development, humanitarian and human rights work, the Microsoft vice-president Tom Burt wrote in a blog post late on Thursday. It did not say what portion of the attempts may have led to successful intrusions. The cybersecurity firm Volexity, which also tracked the campaign but has less visibility into email systems than Microsoft, said in a post that relatively low detection rates of the phishing emails suggested the attacker was “likely having some success in breaching targets”. Microsoft identified the group carrying out the attacks as Nobelium, originating from Russia and the same actor behind the attacks on SolarWinds customers in 2020. Burt said the campaign appeared to be a continuation of efforts by the Russian hackers to “target government agencies involved in foreign policy as part of intelligence-gathering efforts”. He said the targets spanned at least 24 countries. Another issue as the Senate prepares to vote on the January 6 commission bill: about 10 senators have already left town for Memorial Day weekend, according to Fox News reporter Chad Pergram. Even though the Senate may not be at full attendance today, the number of senators required to break the expected Republican filibuster of the commission bill will not change. So even if only 90 senators are present to vote on the bill later today, 60 votes will still be required to advance the legislation past the filibuster. Republicans are expected to defeat the bill because Democrats need 10 of their colleagues from across the aisle to vote with them to break a filibuster, and that seems extremely unlikely to happen. Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell said he hopes the vote on the January 6 commission bill will happen today, but he did not definitively say whether he thought that would happen. According to CNN, reporters asked McConnell as he entered the Senate how long today’s session will take. “You’ll have to ask the folks who feel compelled to speak,” McConnell replied. Asked if the votes on the Endless Frontier Act and the January 6 commission bill will wrap up today, the Republican leader said, “I hope so, but we will see how it goes.” The Senate had expected to give final approval to the Endless Frontier Act yesterday, but some late-night disagreements pushed that to today. Senator Jon Ossoff did not gavel out the Senate until almost 3 am this morning, and the chamber returned from recess about six hours later. Jill Biden will join Joe Biden when he travels to Europe next month, the White House has just announced. The White House said the first lady will accompany her husband as he attends the G-7 summit in Cornwall from June 11 to 13. “This will be the first overseas travel by President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden,” the White House said. “This trip will highlight the President’s commitment to restoring our alliances, showing that democracies can deliver, and working in close cooperation with our allies and multilateral partners.” CNN reported earlier this week that Biden will meet with Queen Elisabeth II during his trip to the UK, but the White House has not yet confirmed that plan. Kamala Harris is making some history this morning: the vice-president will become the first woman to deliver the commencement address at the US Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. The New York Times reports: The vice president’s speech is expected to focus on some of the Biden administration’s most urgent challenges, like the coronavirus pandemic, climate change and a host of increasingly sophisticated cybersecurity threats. ‘The global pandemic has launched us into a new era. It has forever impacted our world,’ Ms. Harris is expected to say, according to prepared remarks shared with The New York Times. ‘If we weren’t clear before, we know now: Our world is interconnected. Our world is interdependent. Our world is fragile.’ The vice president’s speech at the Naval Academy, in Annapolis, Md., will be her first to focus on the military, and it comes as the Biden administration is accelerating its withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, well ahead of the deadline President Biden set in April: Sept. 11. According to a press pool report, Harris stopped at the gravesite of John McCain before her speech to pay her respects to the late senator and lay some flowers on his headstone. The state of Arizona is preparing to kill death row inmates using hydrogen cyanide, the same lethal gas that was deployed at Auschwitz. Documents obtained by the Guardian reveal that Arizona’s department of corrections has spent more than $2,000 in procuring the ingredients to make cyanide gas. The department bought a solid brick of potassium cyanide in December for $1,530. It also purchased sodium hydroxide pellets and sulfuric acid which are intended to be used to generate the deadly gas. The gas chamber itself, built in 1949 and disused for 22 years, has been dusted off and, according to the department, “refurbished”. Over the past few months the Republican-controlled state has moved aggressively to restart its deeply flawed execution system. The death penalty has been in abeyance in Arizona for seven years following the gruesomely botched lethal injection of Joseph Wood in 2014. Last month, the Guardian revealed that Arizona spent a jaw-dropping $1.5m on a batch of pentobarbital in October, a sedative which it now hopes to use as its main lethal injection method. The Senate is now back in session to wrap up votes on the Endless Frontier Act before holding a vote on the January 6 commission bill. The upper chamber stood in recess for a little over six hours. Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff of Georgia gaveled out the Senate at 2:52 am this morning, per a C-SPAN producer. Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer said in a floor speech moments ago that he expects the chamber to pass the Endless Frontier Act later today. “We have every intention of sticking it out until the job is done, and that’s what we’re going to do,” Schumer said. At least 70% of people charged in the Capitol riot have been released as they wait for trial, according to a Guardian analysis. That high pretrial release rate stands in stark contrast with the usual detention rates in the federal system, where only 25% of defendants nationwide are typically released before their trial. Eric Munchel, known as “Zip Tie Guy”, who was allegedly photographed wearing tactical gear and carrying wrist restraints in the Senate chamber, was released in late March, along with his mother, after an appeals court questioned whether he posed any danger outside the specific context of 6 January. Richard Barnett, the Arkansas man photographed with his foot on Nancy Pelosi’s desk, was released in late April, nearly two months after screaming during a court hearing that “it’s not fair” that he was still in custody when “everybody else who did things much worse are already home”. Multiple alleged members of the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers, two groups facing the most serious conspiracy charges related to their alleged plans for violence, have been released before trial, though some prominent leaders in these groups remain in custody. The disparity in pretrial detention rates highlights what legal experts said was a broader development in the 6 January cases: the likelihood that a substantial swathe of the alleged rioters may not serve any prison time at all, even if they are convicted or plead guilty. Greetings from Washington, live blog readers. The Senate is expected to vote later today on whether to advance the bill to form a bipartisan commission to study the Capitol insurrection – for real this time. The Senate was originally planning to hold a procedural vote on the commission bill yesterday, but some late-night disagreements over the Endless Frontier Act pushed the vote to today. Now the vote is expected to take place later this morning or possibly early this afternoon, according to CNN. Senate Republican leaders seem confident that they have the votes to defeat the bill, which they worry could jeopardize their hopes of taking back Congress in next year’s midterm elections. Senator Lisa Murkowski, one of the few Republicans who is expected to support the commission bill, sharply criticized that logic yesterday. “To be making a decision for the short-term political gain at the expense of understanding and acknowledging what was in front of us on January 6, I think we need to look at that critically. Is that really what this is about, one election cycle after another?” Murkowski told reporters. The blog will have more details on the vote as it unfolds, so stay tuned.","charCount":"40446","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/sam-levin\">Sam Levin</a> in Los Angeles (now) and <a href=\"profile/joan-greve\">Joan E Greve</a> in Washington (earlier)"},{"headline":"Dame Quentin Bryce seeks to withdraw from giving  evidence on behalf of Ben Roberts-Smith","standfirst":"<p>It is understood the former governor general no longer wishes to appear as a character referee for the former soldier</p>","trailText":"It is understood the former governor general no longer wishes to appear as a character referee for the former soldier","byline":"Ben Doherty","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"90cab46f09bcd442b59804a3cde134f634135458\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/90cab46f09bcd442b59804a3cde134f634135458/8_310_938_563/500.jpg\" alt=\"Dame Quentin Bryce\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dame Quentin Bryce is understood to be seeking to withdraw as a character reference for Ben Roberts-Smith. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dean Lewins/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Dame Quentin Bryce, the former governor general who pinned Ben Roberts-Smith’s Victoria Cross to his chest, is understood to be seeking to withdraw from giving evidence on his behalf in his upcoming defamation trial.</p> <p>Roberts-Smith’s high-profile action against three newspapers begins in just over a week, and Bryce has been publicly nominated as having agreed to offer character evidence in his defence.</p> <p>Roberts-Smith visited Bryce unannounced at her home in Queensland this week. </p> <p>As recently as late April, his legal team declared in court that Bryce would be called as a reputation witness, having previously written the former soldier a reference.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/may/25/ben-roberts-smith-wiped-laptop-containing-national-security-issues-after-being-asked-not-to-court-hears\">Ben Roberts-Smith wiped laptop containing ‘national security issues’ after being asked not to, court hears</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, the Guardian understands Bryce has been contemplating withdrawing from giving evidence for several weeks.</p> <p>The Guardian approached Roberts-Smith’s legal team late last month seeking confirmation Bryce had indicated she wished to withdraw.

it from the UK blog team, thanks for following our coverage. Immediate action must be taken to save the UK’s music festivals from another “lost summer” due to Covid, a cross-party committee of MPs said. Ministers must create a government-backed insurance scheme for festivals as soon as possible, given their long lead times, a report from the Commons digital, culture, media and sport committee argued, saying even now it would be too late for many events. Another summer without income would not only cause the demise of many smaller festivals, but could threaten the long-term future of the sector as companies in the supply chain also close down and skilled specialist staff move to other jobs. The problems had been exacerbated by a lack of access to the government’s culture recovery fund and by the fact no festivals were included in the series of pilot schemes designed to test the viability of mass events, the committee said. Rule changes in the National Hockey League in the US. A last-minute decision to relax Covid-19 safety rules for Saturday’s Champions League final has angered locals as hundreds of English fans not wearing masks packed Porto’s riverside bars on Friday night. European football’s governing body UEFA moved the final between Manchester City and Chelsea from Istanbul to Porto to allow English fans to travel to the match under Covid-19 restrictions, Reuters reports. Some Porto residents fear a spike in infections because of the highly contagious coronavirus variant spreading in parts of England after first being identified in India. Others are upset that foreign fans can go into the stadium but locals have been banned from attending matches for months. “If they open (the stadiums) for the English, they should open (them) for all,” said Alexandre Magalhaes. Portugal’s government initially said English fans must fly in only on the day of the match, stay in a “bubble” and fly home straight after the game. But on Thursday authorities dropped the requirement for fans to stay in bubbles and lifted restrictions on movement. Masks are no longer required at the three main cinema chains in the US for people who are fully vaccinated against coronavirus, Reuters reports. AMC Entertainment, Cinemark and Regal Cinemas said on their websites that movie goers who are not fully vaccinated will be asked to continue wearing masks, and that other social-distancing measures and cleaning protocols will remain in place. The front page of Saturday’s Guardian in the UK. Brazil registered 49,768 new cases of coronavirus and 2,371 new Covid-19 deaths in the last 24 hours, the health ministry said on Friday. The country has recorded more than 16.3 million cases in total and over 456,000 deaths, Reuters reports. Rwanda’s president, Paul Kagame, has described vaccine distribution in Africa as “scandalously inefficient” and warned against building an “invisible wall” around parts of the world unable to secure jabs. “The fact that Africa is not receiving vaccines, in the end, is not good even for those getting the vaccines,” Kagame told AFP and France Inter. “The backlash will be there, it will come back to them. If we do it equitably, then we have the chance of eradicating it globally. I hope we don’t find ourselves in a situation where it’s like building an invisible wall. Those who have been vaccinated saying ‘we need to remain safe so we need to keep away those who are not vaccinated’.” Kagame said it was essential Africa start manufacturing its own vaccines but pointed to hurdles in the way of investment, intellectual property rights and technology. Victoria has entered its fourth Covid lockdown – but it is the first without jobkeeper and boosted jobseeker payments. Businesses and workers are worried. Here they tell Guardian Australia who they think is to blame and what assistance they require. Mexico’s health ministry on Friday announced 3,006 new confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the country and 411 more fatalities, Reuters reports. It brings the total to 2,408,778 infections and 223,072 deaths. The government has said the real number of cases is likely significantly higher, and separate data published recently suggested the actual death toll is at least 60% above the confirmed figure. Kosovo has agreed to buy 1.2 million Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccines, the first shots bought by the government as it works to speed up inoculations. Kosovo so far has received around 180,000 vaccines, mostly from an EU-funded programme, Reuters reports. “Kosovo has secured 1.2 million vaccines in a deal with Pfizer,” the country’s health minister, Arben Vitia, told a news conference. “We are determined to continue with a much faster process to vaccinate 60% of the population by the end of 2021.” The European Medicines Agency (EMA) backed the use of Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine for children as young as 12, paving the way for a broader rollout in the region after similar clearances in the US and Canada. EMA task force chair Marco Cavaleri said that additional reports of blood clots in people after having the AstraZeneca jab since mid-April shows no change in frequency, but the fatality rate has decreased. World Health Organization experts are preparing a proposal on the next studies to be carried out into the origins of the virus that causes Covid-19, after the last investigating team said a lab leak was “extremely unlikely” and not worthy of further study before the WHO head swiftly said all hypotheses remained under consideration. A single-shot coronavirus vaccine from Johnson &amp; Johnson was approved for use in the UK. The vaccine, developed by Johnson &amp; Johnson’s pharmaceutical arm Janssen, has been shown to be 67% effective overall at preventing moderate to severe Covid-19, with studies suggesting it also offers complete protection from admission to hospital and death. The World Health Organization called for access to patients in the Gaza strip and free passage to evacuate them for medical treatment as health workers struggle to care for the sick and wounded after 11 days of violence. Hotels in Ireland can reopen on 2 June and pubs and restaurants can resume outdoor service on 7 June, the government announced. Ireland will also adopt the European Union’s Covid-19 certificate to help citizens move more freely across the bloc from 19 July and broadly apply the same approach to arrivals from elsewhere including Britain and the US. Indian authorities announced a tentative easing of the lockdown in the capital, Delhi, as coronavirus infections fall in major cities after weeks of restrictions. US secretary of state Antony Blinken said at a meeting with India’s foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, that their two countries were united in tackling the Covid-19 pandemic together, Reuters reports. Fuelling doubts about whether the Olympics can go ahead safely, Japan’s government has, as expected, extended a coronavirus emergency in Tokyo and other parts of the country until just a month before the Games. Lockdown measures in the Netherlands will be eased as of next week, allowing bars and restaurants to serve customers indoors and museums to reopen, the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, said. All Italians aged over 16 will be able to be vaccinated from 3 June onwards, the government’s Covid-19 commissioner has said, with the country also preparing to extend the campaign to 12 to 15-year-olds. The Greek government unveiled the first EU Covid passport, described by the country’s prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, as a “fast lane to facilitate travel”, after a successful dry run of the technology. Beachgoers in the US will be able to get vaccinated against the Covid-19 virus over the Memorial Day weekend, Associated Press reports. Governor Phil Murphy announced the “Shots At The Shore” campaign that will offer free vaccinations Saturday and Sunday at Sandy Hook, Long Branch and Asbury Park in Jersey Shore. The announcement came on the day that New Jersey dropped its indoor mask mandate, which Murphy called “one of the biggest steps we can take to move forward with our recovery.” “We’re going to make it possible for beachgoers to get some sun and at the same time get their first shot,” the governor said. Ireland hopes to permit a staggered return of employees to their offices from August, the government said, with the advice to continue to work from home unless necessary “as strong as ever” until then. Reuters reports: The message is to continue to work from home if at all possible and we anticipate that is going to be the advice until September,” deputy prime minister Leo Varadkar told a news conference. “However we will give consideration, if things continue to improve (in managing Covid-19), to some kind of phased return perhaps in August around people going in on a staggered basis or for training or induction or reasons such as that.” U.S. secretary of state Antony Blinken said at a meeting with India’s foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar that their two countries were united in tackling the Covid-19 pandemic together, Reuters reports. Jaishankar, who has spent the past week in the US seeking help to deal with India’s coronavirus crisis, told reporters while standing with Blinken at the State Department India was grateful to the U.S. administration for strong support and solidarity. Denmark this week began incinerating 4 million mink that had been culled to curb Covid-19 mutations but began to resurface from mass burial sites, prompting renewed health concerns. The government last year decided to cull all of the country’s 17 million mink to curb a coronavirus mutation and because the mammal was considered likely to host future mutations, Reuters reports. Some were buried in pits in a military area in western Denmark under two metres of soil only for some to resurface in less than a month. Contaminants were later found under the graves in an examination carried out on behalf of the Danish Environmental Protection Agency, prompting the government to order the incineration of the the animals. “There’s not supposed to be any virus left, but we burn it at more than 1,000 degrees (Celsius), so if there were any virus left it would definitely disappear,” said Jacob Hartvig Simonsen, the CEO of the ARC waste-management plant. The Taoiseach said the sense of “hope, excitement and relief” is palpable as he confirmed the widespread reopening of Ireland over the summer. Micheal Martin said that while the end of the pandemic is “within our grasp”, he urged the public to “remain vigilant against the terrible virus”, PA reports. As Martin unveiled the government’s plans over June, July and August, he said that the reopening of society and the economy will depend on Irish people following the guidelines in place. Martin confirmed that on June 2, hotels, B&amp;Bs, guesthouses and self-catering accommodation will reopen. On June 7, outdoor services in bars and restaurants will reopen along with cinemas and theatres. On the same date, up to 200 people can attend outdoor events in venues with a minimum capacity of 5000, and up to 100 can attend other outdoor events. In what can only be described as a comedy of errors, an Argentinian TV news channel delivered a stunning, if slightly flawed, scoop when it reported that William Shakespeare, “one of the most important writers in the English language” had died after receiving the Covid vaccine. The mistake of well, Shakespearean, proportions happened on Thursday night after Noelia Novillo, a newsreader on Canal 26 mixed up the Bard with William “Bill” Shakespeare, an 81-year-old Warwickshire man who became the second person in the world to get the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine. William Shakespeare died in 1616, while his namesake – an inpatient in the frailty ward at University hospital, Coventry, at the time of his first vaccination – died this week from a stroke unrelated to the jab. The World Health Organization’s (WHO) top emergency expert Mike Ryan has urged for the separation of the “politics” of the question of the origin of the coronavirus from the science of it, days after US president Joe Biden ordered aides to find answers to the question. “We would like for everyone out there to separate, if they can, the politics of this issue from the science. This whole process is being poisoned by politics,” Ryan said during a press conference, adding further studies are going to be needed to find the origins of the virus. It comes after the last WHO investigating team said a lab leak was “extremely unlikely” and not worthy of further study before the organisation head swiftly said all hypotheses in fact remained under consideration. WHO experts are preparing a proposal on the next studies to be carried out into the origins of the virus that causes Covid-19, The European Medicines Agency (EMA) backed the use of Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine for children as young as 12, paving way for a broader roll-out in the region after similar clearances in the US and Canada. EMA task force chair Marco Cavaleri said that additional reports of blood clots in people after having the AstraZeneca jab since mid-April shows no change in frequency, but the fatality rate has decreased.

A single-shot coronavirus vaccine from Johnson &amp; Johnson was approved for use in the UK. The vaccine, developed by Johnson &amp; Johnson’s pharmaceutical arm Janssen, has been shown to be 67% effective overall at preventing moderate to severe Covid-19, with studies suggesting it also offers complete protection from admission to hospital and death. The World Health Organization called for access to patients in the Gaza strip and free passage to evacuate them for medical treatment as health workers struggle to care for the sick and wounded after 11 days of violence. Indian authorities announced a tentative easing of the lockdown in the capital Delhi as coronavirus infections fall in major cities after weeks of restrictions. Fuelling doubts about whether the Olympics can go ahead safely, Japan’s government has, as expected extended a coronavirus emergency in Tokyo and other parts of the country until just a month before the Games. Lockdown measures in the Netherlands will be eased as of next week, allowing bars and restaurants to serve customers indoors and museums to reopen, Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte said. Hotels in Ireland can reopen on 2 June and pubs and restaurants can resume outdoor service on 7 June, the government announced. All Italians aged over 16 will be able to be vaccinated from 3 June onwards, the government’s Covid-19 commissioner has said, with the country also preparing to extend the campaign to 12 to 15-year-olds. The Greek government unveiled the first EU Covid passport, described by the country’s prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, as a “fast lane to facilitate travel”, after a successful dry run of the technology.

Lockdown measures in the Netherlands will be eased as of next week, allowing bars and restaurants to serve customers indoors and museums to reopen, Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte said. “We are taking another calculated risk”, Rutte said at a news conference. Here’s more on our brief bit earlier, courtesy of Reuters. A total of 316 cases of rare blood clots with low platelets have been recorded in adults who received AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine in the European Economic Area, an executive of the region’s drug regulator said. The figure as of yesterday includes 174 new reports since the European Medicines Agency (EMA) provided an update in April, Georgy Genov, the chief of the watchdog’s safety monitoring operations, said during a briefing today. The EMA has been looking into cases of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) since March and has found a possible link to the vaccine developed with Oxford University, Vaxzevria, and to Johnson &amp; Johnson’s single-dose shot. It has, however, maintained that overall benefits of both the vaccines outweigh any risks posed by them. Genov said a further 19 million people had received the first dose of Vaxzevria in the EEA since the April update, adding that the frequency of TTS has not changed - it is still extremely rare - but the fatality rate following symptoms has decreased. He said the drop in death rates possibly indicated that awareness among those vaccinated and those administering the vaccine and treating patients had gone up, leading to early diagnosis and treatment. France has reported that the number of people in intensive care units with Covid-19 fell by 102 to 3,104 today, while the overall number of people in hospital with the disease fell by 669 to 17,272. Reuters reports that both numbers have been on a strong downward trend in recent weeks. The health ministry also reported 98 new coronavirus deaths in hospitals. Later, it is set to report the death tally for retirement care homes over the past three days as well as data on new cases. The WHO’s European director has warned that the pandemic would not end until at least 70% of people are vaccinated as he criticised Europe’s vaccine rollout as “too slow”. The World Health Organization’s regional director for Europe Hans Kluge said countries and their populations must not become complacent about the pandemic. Don’t think the Covid-19 pandemic is over. The pandemic will be over once we reach 70 percent minimum coverage in vaccination. Our best friend is speed, time is working against us, [and] the vaccination roll-out still goes too slow. We need to accelerate, we need to enlarge the number of vaccines. It is not acceptable that some countries start to vaccinate the younger, healthy part of the population, while other countries in our region still did not cover all the health care workers and the most vulnerable people. In the 53 countries and territories that make up the WHO’s European region, including several in Central Asia, 26% of the population has received a first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine. In the EU, 36.6% of the population has received at least one dose and 16.9% have been fully vaccinated, according to a count by AFP. French president Emmanuel Macron has pledged that his country will invest in boosting the production of Covid-19 vaccines in Africa, to help close a gap in the availability of the shots between African and Western nations. Speaking at a joint news conference with South African president Cyril Ramaphosa in Pretoria, Macron said Africa made up around 20% of the world’s need for vaccines but only 1% of vaccine production. How do we boost the production of vaccines on the African continent? On this, we will this afternoon have an investment strategy to help these industrials produce more, and quite quickly. We need to vaccinate as quickly as possible the maximum number of people ... all over the world. It is our moral duty; it is also in everyone’s interests. He said France already had a partnership with South Africa’s Biovac Institute and would soon launch a project with South African pharmaceutical company Aspen. He reiterated support for waiving intellectual property rights for Covid vaccines, a move also supported by US president Joe Biden but opposed by Germany and the UK among other states. The European Medicines Agency task force chair Marco Cavaleri has said that additional reports of blood clots in people after having the AstraZeneca jab since mid-April shows no change in frequency, but the fatality rate has decreased, according to Reuters. As of yesterday, the EMA had recorded a total of 316 cases of blood clots with low platelets among people who have recently had the AstraZeneca jab in the European Economic Area. Some 17 million people had received at least one dose by 13 April, and since then another 19 million doses have been administered. Hotels in Ireland can reopen on 2 June and pubs and restaurants can resume outdoor service on 7 June, the government has announced. Cinemas and gyms can reopen on 7 June and bars and restaurants can serve customers indoors on 5 July. Non-essential international travel can resume on 19 July in accordance with the EU travel certificate. The announcement heralded a significant easing of one of Europe’s strictest, longest lockdowns. However, Ireland will not restore the Common Travel Area with Britain because of concerns over the Covid-19 variant first identified in India. The government, a coalition comprising Fianna Fail, Fine Gael and the Green party, also approved plans to hold test entertainment and sports events with up to 500 people at outdoor venues. The taoiseach, Micheál Martin, is to outline the plan in a televised address this evening. Everyone arriving in Ireland from abroad, with the exception of Northern Ireland, must complete a passenger locator form and provide evidence of a negative or “not detected” RT-PCR test result. People from countries deemed high-risk – including France and the US – must quarantine in a designated hotel for 14 days. Those from other countries, such as Britain, are advised to self-isolate for 14 days. Travellers going the other way from Ireland to Britain face no such restriction. Ferry companies are urging the Irish government to fully reinstate the Common Travel Area and open a de facto “bubble” with British travellers. The Biden administration is taking “a very close look” at the possibility of vaccine passports for travel into and out of the US, the homeland security secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said today. Like so many other public health measures meant to mitigate Covid-19’s spread, vaccine passports have drawn support and ire. Some welcome the fast pass to normalcy, sick of extended quarantines and tedious testing requirements. Others harbour unsubstantiated concerns that the certificates could chip away at their privacy. Still others worry about vaccine inequality, with the life-saving shots going disproportionately to residents of the world’s wealthiest nations. Vaccine equity campaigners have said it would be “obscene” to allow Johnson &amp; Johnson to put company profits before people’s lives, as their vaccine is approved for use in the UK. Global Justice Now, part of the People’s Vaccine Alliance, is calling on the company to share its vaccine technology and know-how through the World Health Organisation’s Covid-19 technology access pool (C-TAP). The group’s director, who was a trial volunteer for the company’s vaccine, has said he and his fellow volunteers wanted “a people’s vaccine”. Nick Dearden, director of Global Justice Now, said: A single-dose vaccine has huge advantages and could be easier to roll out in low and middle income countries, but we won’t be able to fully utilise this vaccine unless Janssen shares its patents and technological knowhow with the world. NHS staff and trial volunteers like myself poured time and resources into this vaccine. Governments and charities have fronted billions of dollars to make it a reality. The only return we wanted was a vaccine for the world – a people’s vaccine. This is an unprecedented pandemic. Johnson &amp; Johnson is one of the wealthiest companies in the world. We need to put people’s lives before this company’s profits. Anything less would be obscene.” Earlier this month, 450 academics, public health experts, charities, NGOs, unions, MPs, peers, faith leaders, doctors, and patients wrote to Boris Johnson, calling for the UK to support an intellectual property waiver on Covid-19 vaccines and treatments. The UK has today reported 4,182 new cases of Covid-19, up from 3,542 yesterday, and 10 new deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test. The official data showed 38.87 million people had received their first dose of the vaccine, equivalent to 73.8% of the total adult population. The government also said that, as of 9am today, there had been a further 4,182 lab-confirmed cases in the UK. It brings the cumulative total to 4,477,705. That’s it from me, Rhi Storer, for now. I will now hand over the live blog back to Mattha Busby for the rest of the afternoon. Here’s what we know about the European’s Medicines Agency (EMA) approval of the Pfizer vaccine on children: It will be expanded to children ages 12 to 15, a decision that offers younger and less at-risk populations across the continent access to a coronavirus vaccine for the first time during the pandemic. The recommendation follows similar decisions by regulators in Canada and the US last month. The EMA’s recommendation that the vaccine can safely be used on adolescents was based on a study of more than 2,000 adolescents in the U.S. that showed the vaccine was safe and effective. Researchers will continue to monitor the shot’s long-term protection and safety in the children for another two years. Marco Cavaleri, who heads the EMA body, said the European Union regulator had received the necessary data to authorise the vaccine for adolescents and found it to be highly effective against coronavirus. The decision will need to be rubber-stamped by the European Commission and individual national regulators, he said. Breaking news coming in via Reuters, as the European Medicines Agency backs the use of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine for children as young as 12, paving way for a broader roll-out in the region after similar clearances in the US and Canada. The European Medicines Agency’s endorsement comes weeks after it began evaluating extending use of the vaccine, developed with Germany’s BioNTech, to include 12- to 15-year olds. It is already being used in the European Union for those aged 16 and older. This story will be updated as more details emerge. Over in Vietnam, the health ministry is in talks to secure COVID-19 vaccines from Moderna through its distribution partner in Asia, Zuellig Pharma, as the country battles a new outbreak. Health minister Nguyen Thanh Long asked Zuellig Pharma to supply Moderna vaccines to Vietnam as soon as possible so the country can cope with the pandemic effectively, Vietnam’s health ministry said in a statement on Friday. After successfully containing the new coronavirus for most of last year, Vietnam is now battling an outbreak which includes the highly transmissible B.1.1.7 variant and B.1.617.2 variant. The country has placed orders for vaccines from several suppliers and has received around 2.9 million doses from its purchases and via the international COVAX scheme. Vietnam has registered 6,396 coronavirus cases so faf, half of which were recorded in the latest outbreak. At least 1.04 million people in Vietnam have had one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, but only 28,529 have been fully vaccinated, according to official data. A quick news story from Reuters as Russia declines to approve combined AstraZeneca and Sputnik V vaccine trials. The Russian health ministry has declined to approve clinical trials in Russia of a vaccine against COVID-19 combining Russia’s Sputnik V and AstraZeneca’s shots, an AstraZeneca official told Reuters on Friday. Human trials of a COVID-19 vaccine combining a shot from AstraZeneca and Britain’s Oxford University with Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine were approved in Azerbaijan, the United Arab Emirates and Belarus, said Irina Panarina, AstraZeneca general director in Russia and Eurasia. She said AstraZeneca was preparing a response to questions from Russia’s health ministry. Japan has extended its coronavirus state of emergency in Tokyo and other areas for 20 more days, with infections still not slowing as it prepares to host the Olympics. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said: “I am aware that many people are voicing concern about holding the Olympics and Paralympics. “I take them seriously, and I will proceed with preparations for a safe and secure games.” He said the next three weeks are “an extremely important time for us to achieve results” in a two-pronged battle to control infections while expanding vaccinations. The state of emergency, covering Tokyo and eight other metropolitan areas, was expected to end next Monday, but hospitals in some areas are still overflowing with coronavirus patients and serious cases have recently hit new highs. The 20-day extension covers nine areas ranging from Hokkaido in the north to Fukuoka in the south. A 10th area, the southern island prefecture of Okinawa, is already under emergency status through June 20. The Olympics are scheduled to start July 23, after a one-year postponement due to the pandemic. Worries about new variants and Japan’s slow vaccination rollout have triggered calls from the public, medical experts and even a sponsor to cancel the games. Only 2.3% of the population has been fully vaccinated. Japan has reported about 730,000 coronavirus cases and more than 12,700 deaths. Hi there, this is Rhi Storer taking over from Mattha Busby for the next hour. Please send me your contributions to rhi.storer@guardian.co.uk, or alternatively, you can message me on Twitter. All Italians aged over 16 will be able to be vaccinated from 3 June onwards, the government’s Covid-19 commissioner has said, with the country also preparing to extend the campaign to 12 to 15-year-olds. Reuters has more: Prime minister Mario Draghi has so far urged regional health authorities to give priority to the elderly, who are especially vulnerable to the disease. “From 3 June, all regions will be able to open up to all age groups [over 16],” commissioner Francesco Paolo Figliuolo said. Some 11.2 million Italians, or 19% of the population, have completed their vaccination cycle as of Friday, while more than 20 million people have received a first shot. The country has registered more than 125,000 coronavirus deaths so far, the second highest toll in Europe after Britain. With many more vaccinations starting to arrive from the various manufacturers, the government is looking to ramp up its inoculation campaign with the aim of covering the entire adult population by September. Figliuolo said vaccinations might soon be opened up to some 2.3 million Italians aged between 12 and 15 if the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and Italian regulators give the green light. The EMA is expected to approve shots for youngsters later today. “We are ready to vaccinate them,” Figliuolo said. World Health Organization (WHO) experts are preparing a proposal on the next studies to be carried out into the origins of the virus that causes Covid-19, a spokeswoman has said. The US called yesterday for the WHO to carry out a second phase of its investigation into the origins, with independent experts given full access to original data and samples in China. The UK made a similar appeal. WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib told a UN briefing today that experts would prepare a proposal for WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, but that there was no set timeline. Earlier this week WHO’s top emergency expert Mike Ryan said that talks with member states would continue in coming weeks. Illustrating the potential dangers of social media regulation of news content, due to its u-turn, Facebook yesterday lifted a ban on posts claiming Covid-19 was man-made after the Wall Street Journal reported that three staff members at the Wuhan Institute for Virology sought hospital treatment for flu-like symptoms in November 2019. It comes after Adhanom Ghebreyesus in February almost immediately undermined the dismissal by a WHO team that visited Wuhan to investigate the origins of the pandemic of the lab leak theory. The original mission oversaw tens of thousands of tests on animals which did not make any suggestion there was a natural cause to the virus. Prince Charles has suggested that people struggling to return to full health after having the coronavirus should practise yoga. In a video statement to the virtual yoga and healthcare symposium Wellness After Covid, the heir apparent said doctors should work together with “complementary healthcare specialists” to “build a roadmap to hope and healing” after Covid. This pandemic has emphasised the importance of preparedness, resilience and the need for an approach which addresses the health and welfare of the whole person as part of society, and which does not merely focus on the symptoms alone. As part of that approach, therapeutic, evidenced-informed yoga can contribute to health and healing. By its very nature, yoga is an accessible practice which provides practitioners with ways to manage stress, build resilience and promote healing.” The prince said those attending the symposium shared an ambition “to help those for whom the mental anguish and physical challenges of long Covid have been devastating”. He added: “When we work together with a common interest we can build on each other’s ideas and, perhaps, build a roadmap to hope and healing.” Speaking to attendees at the event co-organised by the Yoga In Healthcare Alliance and the Give Back Yoga university, the Prince of Wales also acknowledged his own brush with Covid in March last year, saying: “I seem to have got away with it quite lightly … unfortunately, that is not the case for millions of people in the UK and across the globe.” Travelers coming from Nordic countries will no longer have to show a negative Covid test to enter Sweden from next week, the minister for the interior has said. “We have decided to go ahead with the Nordics first, it’s a priority for us,” the minister, Mikael Damberg, said. Travelers from other countries within the EU will still have to show a negative test until 30 June, Reuters reports. Travelers from outside the EU are still banned. Thirty-two members of parliament in the Democratic Republic of Congo, or about 5% of the total, have died from Covid-19 since the start of the pandemic, the vice-president of the national assembly said. Reuters has the story: Even as Congo, like many other African countries, has officially reported relatively few cases and deaths, the virus has rippled through the corridors of power, killing prominent lawmakers and members of the president’s entourage. “The latest update announced by the government reports 31,248 confirmed cases and 780 deaths, among them 32 members of parliament,” said Jean-Marc Kabund, the first vice president of the lower house of parliament. In December, lawmakers and others in the parliament building flung chairs and buckets at one another during a brawl caused by a rift between president Felix Tshisekedi and his predecessor, Joseph Kabila. Most wore their masks below their chins. Tshisekedi raised eyebrows earlier this month when, during a dinner with supporters in the southeastern city of Kolwezi, he noted jokingly that attendees were violating a curfew imposed in response to the pandemic and said, “Today, you have permission.” Congo’s vaccination campaign has stuttered after it delayed the rollout because of safety concerns about the AstraZeneca shot. As a result, around 75% of the 1.7 million doses it received in March were reallocated the following month to make sure they were used before they expired. Indian authorities have announced a tentative easing of the lockdown in the capital Delhi as coronavirus infections fall in major cities after weeks of restrictions. AFP reports: Rural areas of the country are now seeing the brunt of a surge in cases that has overwhelmed the health care system and killed at least 160,000 people since the start of March. Arvind Kejriwal, Delhi’s chief minister, said that from Monday construction work and factories can resume, “keeping the poorest section of our society, the labourers and daily wage workers, in mind”. “We are starting the process of reopening very, very slowly. We will reassess it after a week based on experts and people’s opinions,” he said. Daily infections reported across India have more than halved from more than 400,000 earlier this month, according to official statistics. Deaths per day have also fallen but by much less, with 3,660 reported on Friday in the previous 24 hours. This is widely seen as a major underestimate. Delhi reported about 1,100 new infections today, down from about 25,000 daily cases when the lockdown was announced six weeks earlier. Even as he announced reopening from Monday, Kejriwal urged people of Delhi to “not step out of your homes unnecessarily”. He said: “This is a very sensitive time and we have to function with full responsibility so that we can together save our Delhi and our country.” A single-shot coronavirus vaccine from Johnson &amp; Johnson has been approved for use in the UK. PA Media reports: The vaccine, developed by Johnson &amp; Johnson’s pharmaceutical arm Janssen, has been shown to be 67% effective overall at preventing moderate to severe Covid-19, with studies suggesting it also offers complete protection from admission to hospital and death. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, welcomed the news. He said: “This is a further boost to the UK’s hugely successful vaccination programme, which has already saved over 13,000 lives, and means that we now have four safe and effective vaccines approved to help protect people from this awful virus. “As Janssen is a single-dose vaccine, it will play an important role in the months to come as we redouble our efforts to encourage everyone to get their jabs and potentially begin a booster programme later this year.” The Danish government has presented its digital coronavirus passport enabling people to travel abroad or, in Denmark, go to the hairdresser, a tattoo parlour, dine inside a restaurant or wherever else it is needed. “The corona passport we present today can be used from 1 July when you can travel within the EU,” said finance minister Nicolai Vammen. AP has the story: Some 20% of Denmark’s population of 6 million have been fully vaccinated, according to the latest figures, he said. During a press conference outside the Copenhagen airport, health minister Magnus Heunicke held up his phone to show the app, which only features a QR code and a green bar if the person has been vaccinated twice or recently tested negative for Covid-19. “What we get now is an app that makes it easier and simpler to use,” Heunicke said. “There is no doubt that we will have to use it over the summer, but it is of course something that needs to be phased out.” People will either have the code scanned or will flash it before entering an airport, a harbor, a train station, a hairdresser or an eatery. In certain cases, a physical document can be sent in the mail to serve the same purpose as the app. However, there have been warnings from across Europe that vaccine certificates could create a form of “medical apartheid”. Last month, more than 1,200 church leaders in the UK said in a letter they are an “unethical form of coercion” and would strengthen the “surveillance state”. This scheme has the potential to bring about the end of liberal democracy as we know it and to create a surveillance state in which the government uses technology to control certain aspects of citizens’ lives. As such, this constitutes one of the most dangerous policy proposals ever to be made in the history of British politics. Holland’s first choice goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen has tested positive for coronavirus and will not travel with the team for a week-long European Championship training camp in Portugal. The Valencia keeper will miss the preparations on the Algarve, which include a friendly international against Scotland on Wednesday. “The medical staff of the Dutch team are monitoring his condition closely and as soon as it is medical responsible, he will be drafted back into the squad,” a statement from the Dutch football association said. Marco Bizot, who was not named in the final 26-man squad by coach Frank de Boer, was already scheduled to travel to the camp in Portugal as a standby keeper, so no replacement is necessary, Reuters reports. Hungary has identified two cases of the coronavirus variant first detected in India, the government official in charge of vaccinations has said. Reuters reports: The central European country has been badly hit by the pandemic, and according to Johns Hopkins University data is the country with the most deaths per 100,000 people. An especially lethal third wave has been easing after an aggressive vaccination campaign. “The Indian variant is present in Hungary, according to experts we cannot exclude the possibility of a new wave of the pandemic,” Istvan Gyorgy, deputy minister and head of the government’s task force on vaccinations, told a news conference. Surgeon General Cecilia Muller added one of the two patients has recovered already. Contact tracing was unable to establish how they were infected. Neither of them spent time abroad recently. The World Health Organization has called for access to patients in the Gaza strip and free passage to evacuate them for medical treatment as health workers struggle to care for the sick and wounded after 11 days of violence. Reuters reports: WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib told a Geneva briefing that around 600 patients, including some with chronic conditions, needed to be referred outside of the Palestinian enclave since the start of the hostilities, but had been unable to due to crossing closures. “It’s very important that we help Palestinians get the care they need, especially helping them get treatment outside the Gaza strip,” she said. WHO has a presence on the ground, Chaib said, but was unable to confirm whether it currently had any access from the outside. Other aid agencies have complained about limited humanitarian access and drug supplies. Dozens of health centres were damaged during Israeli bombings earlier this month, prompting the WHO to warn that facilities risked being overwhelmed. “The capacity of the health system to respond is completely crushed,” Helen Ottens-Patterson, MSF head of mission in Gaza, told journalists earlier this week. In an indication of the challenges ahead, she said that an MSF team had to “wade through rubble and glass” to access a ministry of health compound earlier this week. AFP have this dispatch from Finland as the Scandinavian country opens drive-in voting for local elections on 13 June to manage the risk of Covid transmissions at traditional polling stations. Cars are queued up on an old airport runway on the outskirts of the Finnish capital Helsinki - not for coronavirus tests but for drivers to cast their vote. Outdoor polling stations have sprung up across the Nordic country as authorities try to make voting as socially distanced as possible ahead of the country’s local elections. “Signing in and filling out the ballot paper went brilliantly,” retiree Joukko Salminen tells AFP from inside his white car. “And corona safe too!” Finland’s municipal vote was due to take place in April but was postponed due to the pandemic, after which officials began looking for ways to cast ballots outside during a two-week advance voting period, while protecting the legally protected privacy of voters. “We’ve built screens that stop people being able to see the voting happening,” polling station manager Vesa Kouvonkorpi said. “Because the car is the polling booth, and by law you’re not allowed to see into the polling booth.” Although processing the drive-in votes takes about four times as long as the regular process, the outdoor polling station has proven popular and received 500 voters on its first day, Kouvonkorpi says. Mexico has administered roughly 27.7m doses – about 10.9% of the population – and president Andrés Manuel López Obrador has expressed hopes all adults will have had at least one dose by October. But vaccines have still been denied to many doctors, dentists and medical workers in private medicine – and also some physicians in public institutions. More health workers have died during the pandemic in Mexico than any other country in the hemisphere, according to the Pan-American Health Organisation. Fuelling doubts about whether the Olympics can go ahead safely, Japan’s government has, as expected extended a coronavirus emergency in Tokyo and other parts of the country until just a month before the Games. Organisers said they would now wait to take a decision on whether to allow local fans at the Games until the period ends on 20 June. AFP reports that fans from overseas have already been barred, in an unprecedented decision. Japan has seen a comparatively small virus outbreak, with around 12,500 deaths, and has avoided tough lockdowns. But a fourth wave has prompted the government to put emergency measures in place in 10 regions including the capital. The measures mostly limit the sale of alcohol in bars and restaurants and ask them to close early, while encouraging telework and capping audience numbers at events. “The number of new cases has been declining since the middle of the month but the situation continues to be uncertain,” said prime minister Yoshihide Suga, announcing the extension. Tokyo 2020 chief Seiko Hashimoto told reporters that with the measures being taken “we expect the infection situation to improve.” But she acknowledged that a decision on local fans, originally expected in early June, would now not be taken until the end of the month. “Once the state of emergency is lifted, we will assess how many spectators we can allow in,” she said, adding that there could be different rules for indoor and outdoor venues and the decision would be based on government guidelines. Even under the current state of emergency, sports venues in Japan are allowed to seat 5,000 spectators or 50 percent capacity, whichever is smallest. As pharmaceutical companies face growing pressure to waive patents to allow Covid vaccines to be manufactured quicker to allow more even distribution around the globe, Russia has provided an interesting model on what to do if you would like a certain medicine to be available in your country. Late last year, the Russian government granted Russian drugmaker Pharmasyntez a compulsory licence for one year to manufacture the anti-Covid-19 drug remdesivir under a different name without creator Gilead Science’s permission. Pharmasyntez had asked the Kremlin to allow it to produce a generic version of remdesivir before the decree was issued. Now, Russia’s supreme court has rejected a lawsuit from the US company that challenged the Russian government decision to let the firm develop and market the drug without their consent. Reuters reports that the government said in a decree at the time that the move was in the interests of Russia’s own security. According to the decree, Russia had to pay compensation to the drug’s patent-holder. The amount was not specified. Vikram Punia, its director, said the company had also written to Gilead in July last year to try to obtain their consent in the form of a voluntary licence, but had not heard back. Pharmasyntez produces remdesivir under the name Remdeform. A shipment of the drug was sent by Russia to India on Tuesday as part of a delivery of humanitarian aid. Gilead said in a statement it was disappointed by the ruling and called the issuance of a compulsory licence “unnecessary and counterproductive ... We have stood ready to work with Russia to expand access to Veklury [remdesevir] since [the] mid-2020. Intellectual property is not, and has never been, a significant barrier to access to medicines in Russia.” Its Mattha Busby here taking over the blog from my colleague Martin Belam. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening to everyone reading, do get in touch via Twitter with any thoughts or tips. Stay tuned for updates. Greece has said it is ready to use a Covid-19 travel certificate before its EU-wide launch on 1 July to attract foreign travellers and save its tourism sector from a second summer lost to the coronavirus. Spain’s prime minister Pedro Sanchez also confirmed his country would take part in the trials from 7 June. “This will be decisive in getting the certificate ready before summer begins and is big news for our tourism industry.” The deputy prime minister of Ireland, Leo Varadkar, has said that Irish citizens should be able move more freely across the European Union from mid-July, but cast doubt on whether it would also apply to Britain. South Africa is in a race against time to vaccinate as many people as possible amid signs the virus may be surging again with the approach of winter in the southern hemisphere, when people spend more time indoors, typically allowing for more spread of disease. Japan is expected to extend emergency coronavirus measures in Tokyo and several other regions by about three weeks, according to officials, as the country struggles to rein in a fourth wave of infections less than two months before the Olympics. Japan said it would consider sharing its Covid vaccines with other countries as a ruling party committee urged it to provide a portion of its AstraZeneca vaccine stock to Taiwan. Japan has also today approved the use of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine for those aged 12 and above. Weeks into Taiwan’s worst outbreak since the pandemic began, and 10 days after the island was put on the third highest level of social restrictions, daily totals of new cases are still not decreasing, the health minister has conceded. India reported on Friday 186,364 new coronavirus infections during the previous 24 hours, for its lowest daily rise since April 14, while deaths rose by 3,660. The south Asia region - India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Bhutan, Nepal, Maldives and Sri Lanka – accounts for 18% of global cases and almost 10% of deaths according to analysis by Reuters. The region has exceeded 30 million cases in total. Australia’s government is scrambling to administer first doses of Covid vaccines to unvaccinated aged care homes across Victoria on the first day of a week-long lockdown. Overcrowding in Victoria’s healthcare system is a “bigger public health emergency than Covid”, according to a leading emergency physician who says the state’s doctors and nurses were exhausted even before the latest outbreak in Australia. Czech restaurants will open to indoor diners from Monday. The Czech Republic will also open up to tourists from seven countries – Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia, Croatia, Austria and Germany – under reciprocal agreements. A €2.5bn (£2.15bn) package has been agreed by Germany’s government to help the culture industry get back on its feet as the country slowly emerges from a third wave of the Covid pandemic. The UK business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, has defended health secretary Matt Hancock against criticism that he failed to protect people in care homes at the outset of the Covid pandemic, saying residents “were protected as far as we could”. Professor Christina Pagel, from University College London and a member of Independent Sage, said the India variant was causing concern in England and the road map for reopening the economy should be delayed. Murdo Fraser of the Scottish Conservatives has criticised the continued restrictions in place across Glasgow. He has said if the latest data shows infections are still high then a “more targeted” approach was needed in Scotland. A royal academy chaired by Princess Chulabhorn, the youngest sibling of Thailand’s king, has said it would import 1 million doses of Sinopharm’s Covid-19 vaccine next month, after the Food and Drug Administration authorised its use. The Philippines has suspended the deployment of workers to Saudi Arabia after it received reports that their employers and recruiters were making them pay for Covid-19 testing, quarantine and insurance upon arrival in the kingdom. Russia has registered the world’s first vaccine for animals against Covid, its agricultural regulator said on Wednesday, after tests showed it generated antibodies against the virus in dogs, cats, foxes and mink Health ministers around the world are being urged to sign off on plans to create 6m more nursing jobs by 2030, amid warnings that Covid-19 has exacerbated a global shortage and could spark a “brain drain” from the developing world. That’s it from me, Martin Belam. I will be back on Tuesday. Harry Taylor has our UK live blog, Mattha Busby will be joining you here shortly to carry on bringing you the latest global Covid developments. The Philippines has suspended the deployment of workers to Saudi Arabia after it received reports that their employers and recruiters were making them pay for Covid-19 testing, quarantine and insurance upon arrival in the kingdom. Reuters report that Labour secretary Silvestre Bello said in an order that his department will issue an official statement on resumption of deployment “after this matter has been clarified accordingly”. It was not immediately clear how many Filipinos bound for Saudi Arabia would be directly affected. Saudi Arabia was the most preferred destination of overseas Filipino workers in 2019, government data showed, hosting one out of five Filipinos who landed jobs abroad during that year. The Scott Morrison government in Australia was scrambling to administer first doses of Covid vaccines to unvaccinated aged care homes across Victoria on the first day of a week-long lockdown, as federal ministers rejected criticism of the programme’s rollout. Facilities hurriedly prepared residents for rushed vaccines on Friday as the commonwealth raced to vaccinate neglected populations within the highest priority group it had initially promised to two months ago. The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, had said on Thursday there were 74 residential aged care homes across Australia that had not yet received an initial dose of Covid vaccine, including 16 in Victoria. But he went on a media blitz on Friday morning insisting every aged care home in the state would have received at least one dose by the weekend. The government’s push to vaccinate the remaining aged care homes in Victoria came a day after Hunt announced the recommended two-week interval between flu and Covid shots would be scrapped for aged care settings in Victoria. The operator of one aged care home in Melbourne, who asked not to be identified, told Guardian Australia they were surprised to learn vaccination teams were being sent to their facility on Friday. It presented logistical hurdles to prepare residents at such short notice, they said. Read more here: Federal government scrambles to vaccinate Victorian aged care homes as state enters first day of lockdown My colleague Haroon Siddique has a fuller write-up of those quotes from the UK business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng that we were carrying on this blog earlier: Kwasi Kwarteng defends Hancock over Covid care home claims As a reminder, UK Covid news is now being blogged by Harry Taylor over here: A royal academy chaired by Princess Chulabhorn, the youngest sibling of Thailand’s king, has said it would import 1m doses of Sinopharm’s Covid-19 vaccine next month, after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorised its use. The announcement in the official Royal Gazette surprised some members of the government, which had until now insisted on being the sole importer of Covid-19 vaccines. The FDA on Friday approved the Sinopharm coronavirus vaccine for emergency use, making it the fifth authorised by Thailand after AstraZenaca, Sinovac’s CoronaVac, Johnson &amp; Johnson’s Janssen and Moderna “We want to help plug in the gaps for business, schools, so they can move forward,” Nithi Mahanonda, secretarygeneral of the Chulabhorn Royal Academy told a news briefing. Reuters report that earlier this week, the academy announced it would import “alternative vaccines” to supplement the government campaign. The government says it will have 6m AstraZenaca doses and 3 million Sinovac doses available in June. Just over 1 million of Thailand’s more than 66 million people are fully vaccinated. Nithi said other organisations would be able to buy from the academy’s 1m Sinopharm doses, adding that it did not seek profit. Greece has said it is ready to use a Covid-19 travel certificate before its EU-wide launch on 1 July to attract foreign travellers and save its tourism sector from a second summer lost to the coronavirus. The free certificate will take the form of a QR code on a smartphone or paper, letting authorities determine the status of a visitor based on records in their home EU country. Greece was one of the early advocates of a certificate that would ease European Union travel curbs and help pull the country’s economy from recession by lifting tourism revenues. The European Council and parliament last week reached a deal on the digital green certificate following a rapid pick-up of vaccinations allowing widespread lifting of coronavirus curbs. The European parliament is expected to pass a law in the week from 7 June and more than a dozen EU countries, including France and Spain, have agreed to test the system before a launch on 1 July. The certificate would show if a person had received a vaccine, had a recent negative test or had immunity based on recovery. “It is very, very simple. Essentially, it includes all the information that a member-state would need to welcome a traveller without imposing additional restrictions,” Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said at a presentation of the pass on Friday. Lefteris Papadimas and Angeliki Koutantou report for Reuters that Mitsotakis added: “Greece is ready to launch this digital certificate earlier than 1 July.” He called on EU countries to ensure they stick to the deadlines and facilitate travel over the summer. In a separate event in the northern Spanish city of Soria, Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez also confirmed his country would take part in the trials from 7 June. “This will be decisive in getting the certificate ready before summer begins and is big news for our tourism industry.” South Africa is in a race against time to vaccinate as many people as possible amid signs the virus may be surging again with the approach of winter in the southern hemisphere, when people spend more time indoors, typically allowing for more spread of disease. It is also a critical front in the fight against the virus in Africa, with South Africa recording 40% of the continent’s Covid-19 deaths. Since January, South Africa has vaccinated nearly 500,000 of its 1.2 million healthcare workers and now is adding its older citizens to the campaign. In the past two weeks, nearly 200,000 have received their Pfizer jabs with instructions to come back in six weeks to get their second dose. After a plateau of the disease that lasted a few months, South Africa’s new cases, hospitalisations and deaths are trending up. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases has risen over the past two weeks from 3.33 per 100,000 people on 12 May to 3.97 per 100,000 on Wednesday, according to Johns Hopkins University. The seven-day rolling average of deaths is also on the rise: from 0.10 deaths per 100,000 people to 0.11 per 100,000 over the same period. The increase may seem small, but experts warn it may be the start of a resurgence as the country enters the colder winter months, which start in June. The national coronavirus task force met this week and President Cyril Ramaphosa’s government is pondering the possibility of reimposing restrictions, such as reducing the hours that alcohol can be sold and limiting the number of people at gatherings. “We’re under pressure to reach higher levels of vaccination,” Mosa Moshabela, professor of public health at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, told the Associated Press. “New vaccination centers are opening every day and the numbers being given shots should quickly go from 20,000 elderly per day to 50,000 and then 100,000 per day,” he said. “By June we should reach 200,000 per day. We need to have that kind of volume to get close to vaccinating 5 million elderly by the end of June.” South Africa’s overall goal is to vaccinate 67% of its 60 million people by February. Czech restaurants will open to indoor diners from Monday, health minister Adam Vojtech said this morning, announcing a quicker-than-planned easing of Covid-19 restrictions. Reuters report that the Czech Republic will also open up to tourists from seven countries – Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia, Croatia, Austria and Germany – under reciprocal agreements. Harry Taylor is on our UK live blog duties this morning, and he’s just got that started for the day. If you are after UK news, then you can follow that with him here … I’ll be continuing here with the latest global coronavirus news. The deputy prime minister of Ireland, Leo Varadkar, has said that Irish citizens should be able move more freely across the European Union from mid-July, but cast doubt on whether it would also apply to Britain. “The advice that we have, and we’re accepting this advice, is that there are real concerns about the Indian variant and for that reason, we’re not in a position to restore the common travel area just yet,” Varadkar told national broadcaster RTE. Reuters report he said there would continue to be restrictions for arrivals from Britain, including requirements to have a vaccine or a negative Covid-19 test, even once travel opens up using the EU’s “green certificate”. Very quick snap from Reuters that a Japanese health ministry panel has approved the use of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine for those aged 12 and above. The move, which lowers the threshold from 16, follows approvals in the US and other nations this month for the vaccine to be used for adolescents. On the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, UK business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng was pushed on the issue of people being discharged from hospital to care homes without testing. He was fairly steadfast in repeatedly saying that testing capacity had to be built from scratch, and that is what Matt Hancock and the department did. Weeks into Taiwan’s worst outbreak since the pandemic began, and 10 days after the island was put on the third highest level of social restrictions, daily totals of new cases are still not decreasing, the health minister has conceded. In today’s daily press conference, minister Chen Chih-shung reported 19 new deaths, 297 new cases and an additional 258 cases from a backlog of cases stretching as far as 10 days. He said the trends appeared stable, and were not rising, but the fact they were not visibly decreasing suggested there was still unidentified spread. The 19 deaths is the third consecutive record for daily fatalities. Taiwan is currently on alert level 3, of a four-tier system. Recreation, entertainment and sporting venues have closed, restaurants ordered to do take-away only, and working from home encouraged but not enforced. The backlog of cases has made assessment of trends - and the effectiveness of the response measures - difficult, with up to 95 cases at a time being added to previous daily totals. For the first time in this outbreak, Chen has flagged a possible move to level 4, requiring a lockdown. Until now he has said it would not happen unless there were 14 consecutive days of more than 100 cases (which has happened) and a rate of at least 50% untraced (which has not happened). He said they need to get a clearer picture of the trends, and would have more information early next week. Chen also announced local governments would be allowed to facilitate their own vaccine purchases, with FDA approval, acknowledging the central government’s processes were not procuring fast enough to meet Taiwan’s needs in the context of the current outbreak. About 330,000 people have received at least one vaccine so far, from a population of 24 million. Taiwan’s hospitals have also been told to double their Covid patient capacity by allowing two patients to a room, instead of one. A €2.5bn (£2.15bn) package has been agreed by the German government to help the culture industry get back on its feet as the country slowly emerges from a third wave of the Covid pandemic. The finance minister, Olaf Scholz, has called the package “the biggest cultural subsidy programme” since the end of the second world war. The coronavirus cultural fund is intended to give organisers of events assurances that they will be compensated if performances and concerts are not able to go ahead as planned, as well as making up for the loss of ticket sales due to reduced seating as a result of social distancing regulations. Initially the measures will protect events of up to 500 participants, so that if from 1 July an event has to be cancelled, the organiser will be fully compensated. From the end of August, in anticipation of events being able to increase in size, that will go up to 2,000 participants. The measures, coming as Germany starts to open up after months of tight restrictions, are on top of a multimillion-euro neustart kultur (new start culture) programme announced last year to cover events across the country. “Life is starting again after a long coronavirus winter,” Scholz said. Monika Grütters, the culture minister, said the fund sent a signal to the cultural industry that its “resuscitation deserves the same amount of effort which is being given to other branches”. Read more of Kate Connolly’s report from Berlin: Germany agrees €2.5bn package to help revive Covid-hit culture sector Yesterday UK housing minister Robert Jenrick was touting next spring as a possible starting date for a Covid inquiry. Opposition Labour MP David Lammy has just joined calls to rapidly bring that date forward in the light of the revelations from Dominic Cummings earlier in the week. Meanwhile on LBC, shock-jock Nick Ferrari has been lambasting business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng saying he should be “kicking the door down” of the prime minister, “banging the desk and saying ‘We have got to stick to 21 June, prime minister!’”. Kwarteng replies “You know what Nick, that’s exactly what I’m doing.” The rest of his answer doesn’t make it sound like he is doing that, however, as he reiterates form his earlier media appearances that “What I can’t do is give guarantees on the 28 May” and continues to hold the line that the government will be following the data and there will not be a decision until 14 June. Mario Koran reports for us from Milwaukee that Wisconsin is the ground zero of America’s battle against vaccine hesitancy: Vaccination rates in Wisconsin vary widely between rural and urban areas and political, religious and racial divides – a pattern that mirrors the divide across the nation. In the progressive stronghold of Dane county – home to the University of Wisconsin-Madison – more than 65% of the population has received one dose. In the state’s rural north, Taylor county has vaccinated only 23.5% of the population, state data shows. Vaccine availability once posed the biggest barrier to immunization. But as availability increased, demand plateaued. Now, healthcare professionals are strategizing ways to reach those who haven’t yet been vaccinated but remain open to it. “Most of our rural residents have the information they need about where and when to get vaccinated. So this is no longer primarily an issue about access to the vaccine. It truly is an issue of what is commonly called vaccine hesitancy,” said Tim Size, executive director of the Rural Wisconsin Health Cooperative, a network of 43 rural hospitals. “I’m not talking about those who just say hell will freeze over before they get the vaccine. That’s not where I think any of us probably need to spend our energy because it’s unlikely to get much traction. I’m talking about the number of people who are communicating that they’re not quite ready yet, but with more information and conversation, they may get there.” Read more of Mario Koran’s report from Milwaukee here: Wisconsin: ground zero of America’s battle against vaccine hesitancy Prof Christina Pagel, from University College London and a member of Independent Sage, said the India variant was causing concern and the road map should be delayed. She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “Certainly we have weakened the link significantly between cases and hospitalisations, but we haven’t broken it.” She added: “We now have fewer restrictions in England than we’ve had since the pandemic started, so if enough people get infected, even a really small proportion who need hospital can still end up being quite large absolute numbers.” Asked whether the planned further lockdown easing for 21 June should not go ahead, she said: “So far we’ve kind of been crossing our fingers a little bit, Sage and Public Health England both say it’s a more transmissible variant, we know it has some levels of vaccine escape. “So we’re in a situation where, compared to two months ago, we now have a dominant variant, it transmits faster, and our vaccines are less effective against it.” PA Media reports that asked if it would be “very demoralising” to remain as we are now, she said: “I think what’s demoralising is having a third wave. If we can just delay international travel, delay stage 4 of the road map until we have a much higher proportion of people vaccinated with two doses, we’re in a much, much better position. “We’re only two months away from that, it’s not long to wait. What I don’t want is for us to have new restrictions.” In the UK, business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has become the latest minister to defend health secretary Matt Hancock, saying “Very few people – if anyone – worked as hard as he did.” Hancock had an awkward time in front of parliament yesterday following accusations by former government adviser Dominic Cummings that he had lied to colleagues and the public during the early stages of the pandemic. Kwarteng said: “I think what Matt stressed very carefully yesterday was that he was absolutely focused, right from the start of the pandemic, on saving people’s lives. “He was in a difficult situation as the Health Secretary, in a pandemic, the like of which we hadn’t seen for 100 years. He was under huge pressure. “And as a Cabinet colleague, I know that he worked really hard and very few people - if anyone - worked as hard as he did and he was very committed to saving lives. Now, he said what he said, I fully believe him but we’ll have an inquiry and that will iron out all these facts.” Poulomi Ghosh reports for the Hindustan Times on a vaccine mix-up causing concern: At least 20 people in Uttar Pradesh’s Siddharthnagar district bordering Nepal were administered with different doses of vaccines, in a case of “negligence”. The 20 people who received two different vaccines in two slots are all from Audahi Kalan village and are aged above 45 years. On 1 April, there were given a dose of Covishield, which was their first dose. On 14 May, they were administered the second dose and as the health workers did not check the card to find out which vaccine was administered to them earlier, they were given Covaxin, by mistake. Reports said none of them reported any adverse effect. There are controlled trials ongoing in some countries of mixing vaccines to see if it increases effectiveness. Murdo Fraser of the Scottish Conservatives has criticised the continued restrictions in place across Glasgow. PA Media reports that he has said if the latest data shows infections are still high then a “more targeted” approach was needed. Areas of Glasgow with higher concentrations of coronavirus infections should be targeted with testing and vaccinations rather than the whole city being subject to “blanket” restrictions, the Scottish Conservatives have said. Fraser told the BBC’s Good Morning Scotland: “Our view is the current council-wide lockdown in Glasgow has not been the right approach. “Large parts of Glasgow do not see large numbers of people infected with Covid and yet are affected by these lockdown restrictions. “If the data is still showing a specific problem in Glasgow what we should be doing is isolating that problem … localised surge testing, accelerating vaccinations in those communities and greater support for local businesses who have been really suffering.” Glasgow has been under strict coronavirus restrictions for 270 days and is the only part of the country under tougher Level 3 constraints. An update on restrictions in Scotland’s largest city is expected later today from first minister Nicola Sturgeon. Overcrowding in Victoria’s healthcare system is a “bigger public health emergency than Covid”, according to a leading emergency physician who says the state’s doctors and nurses were exhausted even before the latest outbreak. Victoria is in a seven-day lockdown with 30 cases of community transmission, more than 120 exposure sites, and 15,000 primary and secondary contacts of cases in isolation. The Australasian College for Emergency Medicine Victoria faculty chair, Dr Mya Cubitt, said on Friday that doctors and nurses in public hospitals had been dreading such a situation because they were still recovering from Victoria’s second wave in 2020. At its height, there were more than 700 new cases in a single day. There were 768 deaths overall with hundreds of healthcare workers infected. “We are in the worst crisis that healthcare has faced in many years,” Cubitt said. “You could even say – and I’d love to speak with [chief health officer Prof] Brett Sutton about this – that the access block and overcrowding of the system is the bigger public health emergency at the moment. Whether we have a Covid outbreak or not, emergency clinicians, and all of the many colleagues that we intersect with in the healthcare system, are under extreme pressure.” Read more of Melissa Davey’s report here: Overcrowding in Victorian hospitals ‘bigger emergency than Covid’, expert warns Sky News have just posted a clip of that Kwasi Kwarteng interview on Twitter. Reuters have been looking at the impact of Covid in the South Asia region, and have found that the tally of cases there, according to their figures, passed 30 million today. They report that the south Asia region - India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Bhutan, Nepal, Maldives and Sri Lanka – accounts for 18% of global cases and almost 10% of deaths. But there is growing suspicion that official tallies of infections and deaths are not reflecting the true extent of the problem. India’s decision to halt the export of vaccines until at least October has had a knock-on effect, with other South Asia countries such as Nepal and Bangladesh making diplomatic efforts to secure Covid-19 vaccines to prop up their faltering inoculation drives as their stocks run out. India’s western neighbour Pakistan, with purchases and donations from China and allocations from the World Health Organisation and the GAVI Vaccine Alliance, has now secured more than 18m doses. Pakistan has opened its vaccination campaign to everyone aged 19 or older. As I mentioned, business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has been on Sky News, and he was rather downbeat when asked about the prospects for the roadmap out of lockdown. He said: We don’t want to proceed with the roadmap without considering all the information that we have. I think that the numbers of cases, is a matter of concern. Today’s the 28th of May. It’s impossible for anyone to know what the situation will be like in a week or two weeks time. On the positive side, he said “the other thing that’s very helpful and encouraging, is the fact that the numbers of hospitalizations, and the number of fatalities as well, is considerably lower than it was even just two months ago” Ultimately he keep reiterating that the UK government would be guided by data: There’s lots of facts that we have to consider. I, as business secretary, I’m very committed to try to reopen on 21 June, I can’t guarantee that. And as I’ve said, we’re looking at the data, every day. The UK government dashboard shows that cases, deaths and hospitalisations are all going up, albeit at much lower levels than they were at the height of the pandemic. Kwarteng confirmed that there would be no decision before 14 June. Good morning from London, it is Martin Belam here – you can get in touch with me at martin.belam@theguardian.com. The UK’s business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng looks to have drawn the short straw for media duties this morning – he’ll be on Sky News in a few moments. While we wait for that, here’s Lizzy Davies on calls for 6m more nurses worldwide: Health ministers around the world are being urged to sign off on plans to create 6m more nursing jobs by 2030, amid warnings that Covid-19 has exacerbated a global shortage and could spark a “brain drain” from the developing world. Delegates meeting virtually this week at the World Health Assembly, the key decision-making body of the World Health Organization, are expected to adopt a resolution calling on countries to transform the nursing profession through more investment, support and training. The WHO director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, called on countries to invest in healthcare workers, nearly 50% of whom are nurses and midwives, saying the pandemic had reminded everyone “that these are incredible people doing incredible jobs under incredible circumstances”. “We owe them so much, and yet globally health and care workers often lack the protection, the equipment, the training, the decent pay, the safe working conditions and the respect they deserve,” he said in his opening remarks. “If we have any hope of achieving a healthier, safer, fairer future, every member state must protect and invest in its health and care workforce as a matter of urgency.” Read more here: ‘Protect and invest’: WHO calls for 6m more nurses worldwide That’s it from me, Helen Sullivan, for today. And if, for a break from pandemic news, you’d like to see a praying mantis wearing “tiny homemade 3D glasses”, might I suggest: Russia has registered the world’s first vaccine for animals against Covid, its agricultural regulator said on Wednesday, after tests showed it generated antibodies against the virus in dogs, cats, foxes and mink, Reuters reports. Mass production of the vaccine, called Carnivac-Cov, can start in April, regulator Rosselkhoznadzor said. The World Health Organization has expressed concern over the transmission of the virus between humans and animals. The regulator said the vaccine would be able to protect vulnerable species and thwart viral mutations. Russia has so far only registered two cases of Covid among animals, both in cats. Denmark culled all 17 million mink on its farms last year after concluding that a strain of the virus had passed from humans to mink and that mutated strains of the virus had then turned up among people. Rosselkhoznadzor said Russian fur farms planned to buy the vaccine, along with businesses in Greece, Poland and Austria. Russia’s fur farm industry accounts for around 3% of the global market, down from 30% in the Soviet era, according to the main trade body. Thailand’s food and drug regulator on Friday approved for emergency use the coroanvirus vaccine developed by China’s Sinopharm, Reuters reports, citing a senior official. “The FDA has approved the Sinopharm vaccine,” senior health official Paisan Dankhum told a news conference, making it the fifth Covid-19 vaccine Thailand has approved. Japanese shares jumped on Friday, as investors scooped up stocks after sell-offs due to MSCI’s reshuffle in the previous session, while progress in the country’s vaccination drive lifted risk appetite on prospects of a swift economic recovery, Reuters reports. The Nikkei share average crossed the 29,000 level for the first time since 11 May, jumping 1.95% to 29,106.86, as of 0205 GMT. The index is poised for a weekly gain of 2.8%. Rollouts of Covid vaccines have contributed to positive sentiment as investors hope a steady vaccination drive can help accelerate economic recovery, market participants said. Japan said on Friday it would consider sharing its Covid vaccines with other countries as a ruling party committee urged it to provide a portion of its AstraZeneca Plc vaccine stock to Taiwan, Reuters reports. Taiwan is battling a spike in domestic infections and has vaccinated only about 1% of its population, while Japan has secured more than 400 million doses, double what it needs for its adult population. “We think it’s important to ensure fair access to safe and effective vaccines in every country and region towards achieving universal health coverage,” Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato told a news conference. “We will swiftly consider and look into a concrete course of policy with regard to how we provide other countries and regions with vaccines that exceed the amount for those needed at home. Masahisa Sato, the head of a Japanese ruling party committee on Taiwan relations, said earlier on Friday the government should provide Taiwan with vaccines as soon as possible, adding “when Japan was in need Taiwan sent us 2 million masks.” Kato declined to comment whether Tokyo had received supply requests from specific countries. India reported on Friday 186,364 new coronavirus infections during the previous 24 hours, for its lowest daily rise since April 14, while deaths rose by 3,660. The South Asian nation’s tally of infections now stands at 27.56 million, with the death toll at 318,895, health ministry data show. Japan is expected to extend emergency coronavirus measures in Tokyo and several other regions by about three weeks, according to officials, as the country struggles to rein in a fourth wave of infections less than two months before the Olympics. The state of emergency – the third in the capital since the start of the pandemic – was called in late April and was originally due to end on 11 May, but was extended until the end of this month, as restrictions on businesses failed to make a dent in infections. Media reports said the latest extension could last until 20 June. Infections have fallen in Tokyo in recent days, but the daily caseload is still too high to justify an end to the measures, according to medical experts, while hospitals are contending with a record number of critically ill Covid-19 patients: Hello and welcome to today’s live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic with me, Helen Sullivan. As always, you can get in touch with me on Twitter @helenrsullivan. India reported on Friday 186,364 new coronavirus infections during the previous 24 hours, for its lowest daily rise since April 14, while deaths rose by 3,660. The South Asian nation’s tally of infections now stands at 27.56 million, with the death toll at 318,895, health ministry data show. Meanwhile Japan is expected to extend emergency coronavirus measures in Tokyo and several other regions by about three weeks, according to officials, as the country struggles to rein in a fourth wave of infections less than two months before the Olympics. Here are the key developments from the last few hours: Argentina reported a record one-day number of new Covid-19 cases of 41,080 on Thursday, amid a second wave of infections that has made the country one of the hardest hit in the world, pushing the local health care system to its limit. Africa needs at least 20m doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine within six weeks if those who have had their first shot are to get the second in time, the WHO said on Thursday. Up to three-quarters of new UK Covid cases are thought to be caused by the variant first detected in India, as the reported number more than doubled to almost 7,000, Matt Hancock said on Thursday. The United States called on Thursday for the World Health Organization to carry out a second phase of its investigation into the origins of the coronavirus, with independent experts given full access to original data and samples in China. The US intelligence community acknowledged its agencies had two theories on where Covid-19 originated, with an element embracing a possible laboratory accident as the source of the pandemic. US President Joe Biden said he is likely to release a report detailing the US intelligence community’s findings on the origins of Covid-19 in full. Sweden will go forward with its plan to ease some of its Covid curbs from June 1, prime minister Stefan Lofven said. Germany plans to make enough Covid vaccine doses available to offer a first shot to all children aged 12 and over by the end of August, a draft health ministry document showed.","charCount":"84744","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/nadeembadshah\">Nadeem Badshah</a> (now), <a href=\"profile/mattha-busby\">Mattha Busby</a>,  <a href=\"profile/rhi-storer\">Rhi Storer</a>, <a href=\"profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a> and <a href=\"profile/helen-sullivan\">Helen Sullivan</a> (earlier)"},{"headline":"MPs urge action to save UK music festivals from another ‘lost summer’","standfirst":"<p>Cross-party committee calls on government to create insurance scheme before it is too late</p>","trailText":"Cross-party committee calls on government to create insurance scheme before it is too late","byline":"Peter Walker Political correspondent","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b982df20e7bbcd5c70eb84e0d84e5673de742cd4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b982df20e7bbcd5c70eb84e0d84e5673de742cd4/450_584_2359_1416/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Green Man festival in Brecon, Wales, in 2017\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Festivals such as Green Man in Brecon, Wales, have been ‘treated as the poor relation by the government’, said a Tory MP.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Benge/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Immediate action must be taken to save the UK’s music festivals from another “lost summer” due to Covid, a cross-party committee of MPs has said.</p> <p>Ministers must create a government-backed insurance scheme for festivals as soon as possible, given their long lead times, a report from the Commons digital, culture, media and sport committee argued, saying even now it would be too late for many events.</p> <p>Another summer without income would not only cause the demise of many smaller festivals, but could threaten the long-term future of the sector as companies in the supply chain also close down and skilled specialist staff move to other jobs.</p> <p>The problems had been exacerbated by a lack of access to the government’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/mar/12/uk-arts-rescue-fund-paid-out-just-over-half-money-allocated-covid\">culture recovery fund</a> and by the fact no festivals were included in the series of pilot schemes designed to test the viability of mass events, the committee said.</p> <p>Music festivals had been “treated as the poor relation by the government”, said the committee chair, the Conservative MP Julian Knight, despite the sector – which in a normal year stages nearly 1,000 events – contributing £1.76bn to the UK economy and supporting 85,000 jobs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/may/26/download-pilot-festival-donington-park\">Download festival to return as 10,000-capacity test event – with moshing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“It has been made very clear to us that the vast majority of music festivals do not have the financial resilience to cover the costs of another year of late-notice cancellations,” he said.</p> <p>“If the commercial insurance market won’t step in, ministers must, and urgently: events need to know now whether the government will back them, or they simply won’t take place this year.

Ministers must create a government-backed insurance scheme for festivals as soon as possible, given their long lead times, a report from the Commons digital, culture, media and sport committee argued, saying even now it would be too late for many events. Another summer without income would not only cause the demise of many smaller festivals, but could threaten the long-term future of the sector as companies in the supply chain also close down and skilled specialist staff move to other jobs. The problems had been exacerbated by a lack of access to the government’s culture recovery fund and by the fact no festivals were included in the series of pilot schemes designed to test the viability of mass events, the committee said. Music festivals had been “treated as the poor relation by the government”, said the committee chair, the Conservative MP Julian Knight, despite the sector – which in a normal year stages nearly 1,000 events – contributing £1.76bn to the UK economy and supporting 85,000 jobs. “It has been made very clear to us that the vast majority of music festivals do not have the financial resilience to cover the costs of another year of late-notice cancellations,” he said. “If the commercial insurance market won’t step in, ministers must, and urgently: events need to know now whether the government will back them, or they simply won’t take place this year. There’s still time to get the music playing, but no more room for excuses.” The committee’s report warns that while the government’s plan to exit lockdown includes the prospect of most distancing measures being removed in England on 21 June, it might not be known if this will happen until a week before, which is far too late for festivals to plan. Of events taking place in early July, they will have paid out 40% of their costs by 14 June, and more than a quarter of festivals with a capacity of more than 5,000 have already been cancelled for 2021. The industry has been calling for months for an insurance scheme similar to that offered to the film and TV industries, which allowed production to restart earlier in the pandemic. Despite this, the report says, the government has “refused to take multiple opportunities to address the market failure in the provision of insurance for live events this summer and set the conditions to unlock the significant economic and cultural contribution made by festivals and their supply chains”. One long-term impact could be further consolidation in the sector, the report said, with smaller, independent festivals being replaced or bought up by two big firms, Live Nation and AEG Presents, which already operate nearly a third of events with 5,000-plus attendances. This could in turn affect pricing and diversity, it added. Another knock-on effect of most festivals again being cancelled this year could be what the report called a “permanent skills gap”, with many of the companies that supply services to festivals closing and staff or freelancers changing jobs. A government spokesperson said: “We are continuing to work flat out to support festivals and live events.

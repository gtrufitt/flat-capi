The bowling is looking to be picking up, but when you compare the batting line-up with 2010, it’s not fit to lace the drinks of Strauss, Cook, Trott, KP, Colly, Bell and Prior.

I know we’re lacking Stokes and Buttler, but then again is that a big loss?” Yes! </p> <p>“Buttler seems to have spent his entire Test career built on potential and what he could achieve. But how many times has he turned the game around in Tests? He’s played 50 matches and still trails in Prior’s wake in terms of contributions. In fact, he trails in Bairstow’s wake when you compare their records batting down the order and keeping... Sorry, this message had mutated into a ranting stream of consciousness; I’m going to have a lie down and a gin.” Ha. </p> <p>That’s a rant to relish, but perhaps putting a bit too much weight on the old career average. Not many batsmen have averaged more than 35 in England over the past three years, with the Dukes ball and the seaming surfaces.

Slow, slowish, quick, then quicker still, it all builds to the final act, the shoot-out on the fifth afternoon. Well, not this one. It has marched to the beat of a different drum: super-slow, super-quick, non-existent. Following yesterday’s wash-out, more than half the playing time has already elapsed, and we’ve only had an innings and a bit. The draw is such a hot favourite that if you decide to back it, you’ll have to shell out a tenner for every £3 you stand to win. </p> <p>If you are a betting person, the horse to back is surely New Zealand. Put a fiver on them and you could win £23. The rain, coming on top of Devon Conway’s dream debut, has left Kane Williamson in the driving seat. </p> <p>England, resuming on 111 for 2 and missing all their all-rounders (Stokes, Buttler, Woakes, Curran), could easily be bowled out for 250. That would take about half the day, leaving the other half for the New Zealanders to extend their lead. They could rattle up 200 by noon tomorrow, to hand England a target of about 330 in 80 overs. </p> <p>In a parallel universe, England would race to 450, bowl NZ out for 160, and win by eight wickets. All Joe Root would have to do is make 180 and then grab one of his cheap five-fors. Stranger things have almost happened.</p> <p>Play starts at 11am, as ever – the extra eight overs in the day, if we get them, will be tacked on at the end. See you shortly. <br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-06-05T09:19:36.601Z\">at 10.19am BST</time></p>  </div>","wordcount":"3636","firstPublicationDate":"2021-06-05T09:16:14Z","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2021-06-05T13:17:15Z","liveBloggingNow":"true","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/p/hktcv","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee55e1fde728dee2cd8528e9015e4740c1820746/148_262_3355_2014/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","isLive":"true","bodyText":"78th over: England 183-6 (Burns 77, Robinson 27) A good ball from Santner, drifting in and turning away as Robinson pokes forward at thin air. But Robinson is showing us what a strong character he is – four wickets when Broad took none, 27 runs when several others got none, and most of it achieved under a big black cloud. He’ll probably be banned for the next Test, and rightly so, but he will be back and his grit, along with Jofra Archer’s elbow, could hold the key to the Ashes. Robinson chips Santner over mid-on and runs two, to get England over the line – but not yet out of the woods. 77th over: England 178-6 (Burns 76, Robinson 24) One of the two runs comes along right away, albeit in uncertain fashion, as Robinson flaps at Wagner’s stock ball – the bouncer. Burns plays and misses again, this time with a prod at a length ball that holds its line. One run to save the follow-on. Three overs to the new ball, which explains why we’ve been seeing the supporting cast. 76th over: England 177-6 (Burns 76, Robinson 23) Robinson flicks Santner to leg – and flicks short leg’s trouser leg, but safely, as whoever it is doesn’t have time to get his hands down to his shin. Burns then plays a sweep and misses, outside off. Two needed! 75th over: England 175-6 (Burns 75, Robinson 22) Wagner continues, and even he may be wondering why. There’s heavy cloud cover – get a swinger on. Burns takes a leg-bye and Robinson tries some nice decisive leaves. He’s about halfway to proving that England do have an allrounder after all. “Re Robinson,” says Daniel King, “surely people can see the disconnect between standing in a Moment of Unity with anti-discrimination shirts on, and having to explain remarks which – however long ago – are the absolute antithesis of what the ECB is trying to achieve right now.” 74th over: England 174-6 (Burns 75, Robinson 22) Kane Williamson, who usually knows what he’s doing, seems to be at sea here. He takes de Grandhomme off, which makes sense, but brings Mitch Santner on, rather than Jamieson. Robinson keeps him out. Five still needed to see off the follow-on. 73rd over: England 174-6 (Burns 75, Robinson 22) Wagner to Burns: nothing to report, except a certain amount of dogged inelegance. 72nd over: England 174-6 (Burns 75, Robinson 22) A no-ball and another single off de Grandhomme, who has also prompted a thought from Bill Hargreaves. “Can’t we get a team together with the likes of Colin de Grandhomme, Bryson Dehambeau, Basil D’Oliveira, Phil DeFreitas, et al? It could have been presided over by good old Phil de Greek, except that he’s now passed into the hands of Old Father Time.” Bill, you’re speaking my language. But I suspect we’ll need to let in people called du as well as de, De and D’. Come back, Faf du Plessis, your people need you. 71st over: England 172-6 (Burns 74, Robinson 22) From the Pavilion end it’s Wagner, who hasn’t found his mighty mojo yet. Burns takes yet another single with a prod to leg. Southee is believed to be off the field. “The cricketing world would be a less lively place,” says Abhijato Sensarma, “without the Kiwi bowling attack operating in it. There is something charming yet off-putting about them, isn’t there? Wagner, Southee, even the absentee Boult – they are the kind of killers who go around assassinating batters with a smile on their face. They’re not full-blooded pacers, but it’s nice to see a collective of their kind be charming on the field as well.” 70th over: England 171-6 (Burns 73, Robinson 22) Robinson takes advantage of Williamson’s generosity, cutting for four and again for two, which leaves only eight needed to save the follow-on. Not even England can mess that up, can they? The players are back from lunch, and the ball is in the hands of Colin de Grandhomme, which is a bonus for England. Maybe Southee’s exhausted. “Is it necessary,” asks Richard Horrocks, “to keep talking about Robinson’s tweets? I still have elderly grandparents who grew up in (and probably engaged with) very racist attitudes. Should that be dragged up too? Punishing the lad won’t deter anyone, it will just make it that much harder to connect with hearts and minds. This isn’t about judgement and punishment, but getting people to understand and giving them the chance to learn and grow. How we respond to Robinson now sends a message out to others about how they too will be received. Robinson has owned his mistake. Is that not enough?” Two interesting comments have come in on England’s predicament. “All those counties, all those posh schools and all those academies,” says Gary Naylor on Twitter, “and England end up with this top seven.” We could spend the whole afternoon unpacking that sentence. And here’s Tom van der Gucht. “Root did seem to be getting ahead of himself with his aim to win all this summer’s Tests.” You’re telling me – that was a textbook blunder. “Unfortunately, with the exception of a few players, England are a bit of a middling side at the moment. The bowling is looking to be picking up, but when you compare the batting line-up with 2010, it’s not fit to lace the drinks of Strauss, Cook, Trott, KP, Colly, Bell and Prior. Now, the team is packed with callow rookies. I know we’re lacking Stokes and Buttler, but then again is that a big loss?” Yes! “Buttler seems to have spent his entire Test career built on potential and what he could achieve. But how many times has he turned the game around in Tests? He’s played 50 matches and still trails in Prior’s wake in terms of contributions. In fact, he trails in Bairstow’s wake when you compare their records batting down the order and keeping... Sorry, this message had mutated into a ranting stream of consciousness; I’m going to have a lie down and a gin.” Ha. That’s a rant to relish, but perhaps putting a bit too much weight on the old career average. Not many batsmen have averaged more than 35 in England over the past three years, with the Dukes ball and the seaming surfaces. Stokes has been phenomenal, on and off, and Buttler has been immense lately – when not being rotated. 68th over: England 164-6 (Burns 72, Robinson 16) And that’s luncheon. Robinson has done well to steady the ship, after threatening to scupper it with those terrible tweets. And Burns is still there, albeit so becalmed that he’s being outscored by a bowler making his debut. Like his opposite number Devon Conway, Burns has seen a lot of partners come and go. So England still need 15 to avoid the follow-on. And the morning belongs to Tim Southee, who showed up a gauche middle order with a spell of exemplary swing bowling. See you in half an hour. Meanwhile, why not sign up to The Spin, if you don’t already. And Graham Hardcastle has the latest county news: It was off the pad only, as Robinson had realised. You wait ages for a mistake from Michael Gough, and then he makes two in one morning. Off the spinner, Santner, at short leg. He reviews straight away, so maybe it’s not out... 67th over: England 164-6 (Burns 72, Robinson 16) One more to each batsman as England continue to get ’em in singles. The partnership has crept to 24 and could really do with adding another 15. 66th over: England 162-6 (Burns 71, Robinson 15) Just a single off Jamieson as the cameras find a pair of small boys in T-shirts, with their dad, I presume. They must be about 9 and 11 and are busy with a scorebook, one filling it in, the other keeping a close eye on him. That was me and my brother Charlie when New Zealand came here in 1973. Be warned, lads: you may both become cricket writers, and one of you could end up on the OBO. 65th over: England 161-6 (Burns 70, Robinson 15) Burns nudges a single off Wagner, who is pitching it up rather than bombing him, presumably because the bombs can bring boundaries. “Whiffs of 80s and 90s nostalgia,” says Colum Fordham, “as England embark on a trademark collapse and try admirably to set up a New Zealand victory AGAINST ALL ODDS. Though writing from a surprisingly Lords-like overcast Naples, I just heard from my brother Kit in London who has been down to the graveyard with his young sons to play a bit of cricket (interesting location, I know, but apt). One of my nephews made a six and out. I’m sure he was influenced by England’s callow young middle-order batsmen. My brother has just opened another can of cider to ease the pain.” As emails go, that’s more of a novella. 64th over: England 160-6 (Burns 69, Robinson 15) Robinson gets a touch too confident, wafting at a lifter from Jamieson with the bat dangling at 45 degrees – neither one thing nor the other. He’s then beaten on the inside edge as Jamieson gets the shape back in with which he started the proceedings today. Still 19 needed to avoid the follow-on, and Robinson may have to get most of them – as Mike Atherton points out, Rory Burns has made only 10 this morning, off 60 balls. The wheel is there to be grabbed if he can manage it. 64th over: England 160-6 (Burns 69, Robinson 15) Here is Wagner, whose bowling in this game hasn’t been quite as hot as his batting. Robinson greets him with another good shot, a clip for three. “Can we talk,” says Tom King, “about that terrible Jet advert played between overs? It’s as if they’re trying to find the least crickety sound possible.” I’ll have to take your word for it, Tom. Between overs, I’m so busy stringing a sentence together, I wouldn’t hear a clap of thunder. 63rd over: England 157-6 (Burns 69, Robinson 12) So we do get a bowling change, but instead of Wagner for de Grandhomme, it’s Jamieson for Southee. His extra height induces a wacky shot from Robinson, who steps away and slashes over the slips for four. He thus becomes the fourth Englishman to reach double figures in this innings. To celebrate, he plays a much better stroke, a back-foot glide to cover point that deserves more than a single. Here endeth the masterclass. 62nd over: England 151-6 (Burns 69, Robinson 7) de Grandhomme goes back to joining the dots. Time for a burst of Neil Wagner, surely. 61st over: England 151-6 (Burns 69, Robinson 7) Williamson seems to have decided to bowl Southee all day long. For a change he tries a bouncer, which Burns pulls crisply but only for a single. In the commentary box are Ian Ward and Rob Key, and Ward is scoffing at Key’s ignorance of the fact that the Lord’s floodlights bob up and down (they’re up now, even though the sky is largely blue). Key takes it very genially, so the attempt at one-upmanship rather backfires. 60th over: England 150-6 (Burns 68, Robinson 7) de Grandhomme concedes a few singles, for once, so England make it to a minor milestone. They need another 29 to see off the possibility of the follow-on. Here’s Richard O’Hagan again. “I know that there’s a lot of 90s nostalgia around at the moment – music reviews, Euro 96 reviews and so on – but England being thrashed by NZ was one memory I really didn’t want to revisit.” 59th over: England 147-6 (Burns 67, Robinson 5) Robinson plays his first decent shot, a firm push down the ground off Southee, which is saved by a diving stop from Kane Williamson. If he’d thought about it, Williamson might have let it trickle for four, to give Southee a few more goes at Robinson. Southee could afford to concede the extra run: his spell now stands at 11-6-18-3, and it may have won the match. 58th over: England 143-6 (Burns 66, Robinson 2) Burns needs to get a move on, but de Grandhomme isn’t the bowler you’d choose for that scenario. He keeps it tight apart from a big fat no-ball. Burns has only five from his last 30 balls, so the question now is whether he can take charge. “Just done a team sprint triathlon in Leeds (I know I know, anything to get out of the house),” says Guy Hornsby. “Checked my phone after the finish to a flurry of notifications. I thought ‘it can’t be the cricket’ but... Of COURSE IT CAN. I know we’re keen on a result but.... Oh England.” 57th over: England 142-6 (Burns 66, Robinson 2) One debutant gives way to another as Ollie Robinson comes in. His first Test has been a right old rollercoaster – four wickets and one disgrace, albeit from years ago. And he nearly gets a golden duck, just saving himself from a big LBW shout by getting an inside edge. Robinson can bat, but he hasn’t shown it yet – he gets off the mark with a leaden-footed squirt through the slips. This is riveting. Another duck! Poor Bracey’s first Test innings comes to a miserable end as Southee bends one back up the slope and the bat goes some way down the wrong line. England have lost three for none in 21 balls. It’s a classic English collapse, and they still need 39 to avoid the follow-on. 56th over: England 140-5 (Burns 66, Bracey 0) Time for a bowling change, as Jamieson takes a breather and Colin de Mullet comes on. It’s a maiden from him to Burns, and that’s drinks, with New Zealand well on top. England’s grown-ups have been fine, making 108 runs for once out, while the kids are all wrong – Sibley 0, Crawley 2, Pope 22, Lawrence 0. These ducks and twos won’t do: if you’re going to struggle, at least stick around for half an hour. “You see,” says Richard O’Hagan, “this is why England picked a top-order batter at number 7. It all makes sense now.” 55th over: England 140-5 (Burns 66, Bracey 0) And here comes James Bracey, on debut. Facing the demon Southee, he leaves one that’s a little too close for comfort, then traps a full ball in the crease like a footballer. But he’s survived five balls, which is three more than Lawrence managed. Southee’s spell now: 9-6-11-2, Timmy with a strong whiff of Jimmy. Another one! Southee sends down a piece of sheer temptation, in the form of a full outswinger. And Lawrence takes the bait, giving Colin de Grandhomme, at third slip, a catch so simple that he could have held it in his mullet. 54th over: England 140-4 (Burns 66, Lawrence 0) Dan Lawrence has come in, but has only faced one ball so far. He is England’s sixth specialist batsman, something that hardly ever happened under Ed Smith – who is having rather a good game, as absent friends often do. 53rd over: England 140-4 (Burns 66, Lawrence 0) Great stuff from Southee, whose spell has been impeccable: 8-5-11-1. “I wonder,” says David Reynolds, “if any of your readers might know what ails the overseas TMS feed. To begin with, the Youtube page for Day 4 produced no sound, and now the link for it has disappeared from the BBC Cricket page. In the meantime, this Middlesex man is hoping for oodles of Surrey runs today.” Yes, he’s gone! It was a very plumb plumb, and Southee knew it. Gough is not God after all. And Pope’s promising innings turns out to be a mere cameo. The only reason to think this is not out is that Michael Gough said so, and he is hardly ever wrong. 52nd over: England 140-3 (Burns 66, Pope 22) A glance from Pope, so he gets down the other end, the better to decide who it is that Jamieson really resembles. And finally we have a commanding shot from Burns, clipping for four in front of square. He could do with a hundred here after six consecutive Tests of diddly squat. 51st over: England 135-3 (Burns 62, Pope 21) After that flurry of runs, Southee decides a maiden is required, and Burns obliges. “Jamieson just offered up one cheeky grin too many,” says Robert Cookson, “and I realised that he has more than a passing resemblance to a youthful Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson. I’m done for the day.” Kyle Jamieson thus becomes the first person ever to be likened to both B Johnson and R Redford in the same morning. 50th over: England 135-3 (Burns 62, Pope 21) Burns takes a single off Jamieson, and Pope clips a blameless ball square for four. Isa Guha heard him taking guard and asking for middle-and-off, which enables a shot like that – but if he misses, playing a ball on middle stump with half a bat, he’ll be plumb. Intriguing stuff. 49th over: England 130-3 (Burns 61, Pope 17) Pope, freed from the shackles of Jamieson, spots a half-volley from Southee and creams it to the extra-cover boundary. That’s the shot of the morning, not that the bar is a high one. And then it’s trumped by an on-drive off a pretty good ball, swinging out from middle-and-leg. Pope is moving the game along at a good lick, which is just what it needs. “Jamieson has something of the Tremlett about him, don’t you think?” says Kevin Wilson. “Not super quick, about Anderson or Broad pace, but he just looks huge! A lovely, flowing action too. Broad is the same height more or less but wouldn’t intimidate me half as much as Jamieson would.” Broad, right now, only intimidates coaches and people called Warner. But with a bit of luck he’ll see himself being written off and get 6 for 20 in the second innings. 48th over: England 122-3 (Burns 61, Pope 9) Another four to Pope, another thick edge off Jamieson, but with a bit more control this time. Then we get the first single of the day, as Pope nudges to fine leg. Burns, facing Jamieson for the first time, is turned around and slammed on the back pad. There’s a big appeal but the ump reckons it’s too high. Ooh – umpire’s call. On this evidence Jamieson is much like Ollie Robinson, but even more effective, because taller and that bit more experienced. 47th over: England 117-3 (Burns 61, Pope 4) With the ball moving sideways, Rory Burns – who does plenty of that himself – looks like a wicket waiting to happen. But he’s a fighter and he gets off the mark for the morning with a shovel for two off Southee. 46th over: England 115-3 (Burns 59, Pope 4) We have some runs! Four of them, to Ollie Pope, but off a thick edge – a bit of a grope from Pope. And next ball he plays and misses. How many do England need to avoid the follow-on? Another 60 or so. 45th over: England 111-3 (Burns 59, Pope 0) At the other end – running in from the Pavilion – it’s Tim Southee, and he too is swinging it round corners. Rory Burns does well to keep him out. The England players have a new word emblazoned on their chests: cinch, which is exactly what this isn’t. “Good morning,” says John Starbuck. “At this rate, we might get a man carrying his bat after all, if Burns can retain his poise and do the business.” 44th over: England 111-3 (Burns 59, Pope 0) That’s a wicket maiden and a fabulous start from Jamieson, who is finding big swing as well as steep bounce. And he looks like Robert Redford on stilts. It’s the first ball and ... Joe Root is caught at first slip! Slight doubt over whether the catch was clean, but it was - well held Ross Taylor, and well bowled Kyle Jamieson. The shot was the classic fend, off the back foot, and England have lost their only experienced batsman. The players are out there, and the sun is not – though there’s plenty of blue in the sky. There is a rhythm to a Test match, a classic structure. Slow, slowish, quick, then quicker still, it all builds to the final act, the shoot-out on the fifth afternoon. Well, not this one. It has marched to the beat of a different drum: super-slow, super-quick, non-existent. Following yesterday’s wash-out, more than half the playing time has already elapsed, and we’ve only had an innings and a bit. The draw is such a hot favourite that if you decide to back it, you’ll have to shell out a tenner for every £3 you stand to win. If you are a betting person, the horse to back is surely New Zealand. Put a fiver on them and you could win £23. The rain, coming on top of Devon Conway’s dream debut, has left Kane Williamson in the driving seat. England, resuming on 111 for 2 and missing all their all-rounders (Stokes, Buttler, Woakes, Curran), could easily be bowled out for 250. That would take about half the day, leaving the other half for the New Zealanders to extend their lead. They could rattle up 200 by noon tomorrow, to hand England a target of about 330 in 80 overs. In a parallel universe, England would race to 450, bowl NZ out for 160, and win by eight wickets. All Joe Root would have to do is make 180 and then grab one of his cheap five-fors. Stranger things have almost happened. Play starts at 11am, as ever – the extra eight overs in the day, if we get them, will be tacked on at the end.

Nadal, the 13-times French Open champion, will go into battle later today against Cameron Norrie, the British No 2, while Djokovic takes on Ricardas Berankis of Lithuania and Federer meets the left-handed German Dominik Koepfer. </p> <p>British fans will be fascinated to see how Norrie gets on: he was impressively consistent in his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/jun/03/cameron-norrie-wins-at-french-open-to-set-up-potential-tennis-clash-with-rafael-nadal\">second-round win against Lloyd Harris</a>, but will he have the weapons to trouble the king of clay? We will find out from around 1.15pm.</p> <p>In the women’s competition, a few big names have admittedly fallen early: Naomi Osaka withdrew, sparking a global debate about mental health and media coverage which rumbles on, while Ash Barty, the world No 1, was forced to retire from the tournament with a hip injury. The reigning champion Iga Swiatek of Poland is still very much in contention, however, in ominous form, and is clearly feeling increasingly confident about a second title. Swiatek faces a potentially tricky tie against 30th seed Estonian Anett Kontaveit this afternoon, scheduled on court at 3pm. Barbora Krejcikova will be the opposition for Elina Svitolina (5) on Philippe-Chatrier from 11am, while the fourth seed Sofia Kenin meets her American compatriot Jessica Pegula on Court Suzanne Lenglen. Coco Gauff v Jennifer Brady is another all-American affair from 3.15pm.</p> <p>There is light cloud covering Paris at the moment but no rain is expected, and the sun is scheduled to peep through the clouds later in the day. Let’s get started!</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-06-05T09:15:01.822Z\">at 10.15am BST</time></p>  </div>","wordcount":"3821","firstPublicationDate":"2021-06-05T09:02:52Z","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2021-06-05T13:16:56Z","liveBloggingNow":"true","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/p/hktdb","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/039d52db092c85bf35f894e2879c96d350e344da/0_114_3427_2056/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","isLive":"true","bodyText":"Another man with a two-set lead is Novak Djokovic after he holds his serve to take the second. There was definitely more resistance from Berankis this time around but it was inevitable the Serb would win it. After a second set battle with Carlos Alcaraz, Jan-Lennard Struff wins it on a tie-break to go 2-0. The Spanish teenager, despite being down, looks like a fine player in the making. Berankis wins a service game to love but then Djokovic does the same to make it 5-3. Djokovic just a game away from taking the second set. Djokovic breaks and is now 3-2 up. I doubt he will allow Berankis back into this set. Another Djokovic hold and it’s 2-2. Now, Will Unwin is here to guide you through the next little while, as I go to assess what’s in the fridge. See you soon. In the women’s singles: Kenin (4) and Pegula (28), on Court Suzanne Lenglen, are now locked at one set all (6-4, 6-1) and playing a decider! In the men’s singles, meanwhile, Ymer is battling back against Sinner on Court 14. Sinner took the first set 6-1, now Ymer leads 5-3 in the second. Djokovic punishes himself for a sloppy error by repeatedly bashing the clay off one of his trainers with his racquet. Berankis now holds again, and this now does have the look of a competitive tennis match, rather than an exhibition laid on for the Serbian. Djokovic hits the shot of the match so far, a sumptuous back-handed winner from outside the tramlines which arrows down the line and bounces in the corner. Berankis can only watch, and admire, as it flies past him. And it’s a comfortable hold for the Serb, now 1-1 in the second set. Berankis leads 1-0, second set! That was a very tidy hold of serve by the 30-year-old. Djokovic still has the look of a man indulging in a relaxed Sunday morning hit-out at his local club, though. Djokovic takes the first set, 6-1, coming to the net and cushioning a smart drop volley that Berankis does not have a hope of reaching. The 2016 Roland Garros men’s singles champion is in total control. Berankis raises his level and fashions a couple of game points. Djokovic fires a powerful forehand winner for 40-30, but the Lithuanian volleys a winner on the next point, and he is on the board! It’s 5-1. Much better from Berankis, the world No 93. Djokovic storms into a 5-0 first-set lead against the hapless Ricardas Berankis. Can the Lithuanian find a way to establish himself in this match? He’s serving to try and stay in the set. This, in fact, is Musetti’s first Grand Slam. And he’s into the last 16. Great story, and clearly a very talented youngster: Djokovic crafts a well-judged double-handed backhand winner down the line for 4-0. One-way traffic, and then some ... Djokovic slices a crisp drop shot of his own now against the Lithuanian. Berankis can’t get it back. Break point for Djokovic to make it 4-0. Berankis tries a drop shot. Djokovic runs it down ludicrously easily, and pats it back over the net at an angle, with Berankis just standing on the baseline, watching the action from a distance. That sums up how one-sided it’s been so far ... Berankis winds up a big crosscourt winner during Djokovic’s next service game, but the Serb eventually holds comfortably enough, and creates a 3-0 lead in the first set. Regulation stuff so far. Straight off the bat - or indeed the racquet - Djokovic breaks Berankis, and leads 2-0 in the first set. The women’s champion, Iga Swiatek, is due on court at 3pm today for her match against Anett Kontaveit. Swiatek was in flying form against Rebecca Peterson in the second round, sweeping her opponent aside 6-1, 6-1, but has drawn attention to the fact that she’s already lost to Kontaveit twice, most recently at the Australian Open last year. You feel, however, that if Swiatek can maintain that level from the second round then she will progress. Djokovic holds, and he is on the board against Berankis. Cheeky from Musetti, very cheeky, in that match that just concluded: Straight into Djokovic v Berankis now, which is just starting on Philippe-Chatrier. Musetti is into the last 16 of a grand slam for the first time! Well done, well done. In truth, that final set wasn’t exactly a classic, but what a battle over five sets. Three more match points for Musetti ... Cecchinato holds - and saves three match points in the process! It is 5-3 now, and Lorenzo Musetti can have another bash at serving for the match. Djokovic, who is yet to drop a set in the tournament so far, is about to walk out on to court for his match against Ricardas Berankis. A beautifully sliced volley by Musetti, after he comes to the net, but Cecchinato manages to break and it’s 5-2 in the fifth. Musetti goes 5-1 up against Cecchinato! He will serve for the match, and a place in the last 16. Jannik Sinner is 3-1 up on Mikael Ymer on Court 14 in their first set. Now, over to Court 7, and this all-Italian five-set marathon between Cecchinato (ranked 83) and Musetti (ranked 76). Musetti, the 19-year-old, has just gone 4-1 up in this final set, so is in a commanding position. Krejcikova speaks: “I’m super happy ... I can’t really believe it. I’m so happy I was able to play my tennis, the game plan was working, I think most of my shots they’ve been actually amazing. This was, so far I think, my best match, I’m so happy that I’m here, that I’m enjoying the game, that I’m entertaining the crowd ... thank you so much for coming today. I’m just extremely happy.” Regarding that 21-minute hold of serve in the first set, at 4-3, she adds: “Every game is important ... especially against Elina because she is such a great fighter, it’s so hard to play against her so I think every single point actually counts. That game was for sure very important, I made it to the 5-3 and I was able to break her and take the first set.” Stunning! The world No 6 is out! What an accomplished performance that was by the Czech 25-year-old, who initially made her name as a doubles player. The world No 33 Krejcikova will face Sloane Stephens in the last 16. Two match points for Krejcikova! Svitolina crunches a backhand winner down the line to fight back to 15-15 in this crucial service game. Krejcikova is totally unflustered, though, and finds a lovely forehand winner in the next point after battling to control a baseline rally. Game point for Krejcikova to make it 5-2 vs Svitolina. And BOOM! She wins the game with a massive forehand after an indifferent forehand to the middle of the court by her opponent. Krejcikova is one game away from a resounding victory against the No 5 seed. Svitolina battles back to hold serve and it’s 4-2. The audio from Court 7 (Cecchinato v Musetti) is coming through on Eurosport’s coverage of Krejcikova v Svitolina, for some reason, but we’ll struggle on. We have the audio for the match on telly, too, so we’re doubling up. Krejcikova earns two break points. There is an exchange of slow, looping, high-bouncing shots from the baseline, before Svitolina moves in for the kill and smashes a forehand winner. And another forehand winner, and it’s deuce! Svitolina may be rattled by the form of her opponent but she’s battling on. In the men’s: Cecchinato and Musetti are engaged in a five-set epic now: 6-3, 4-6, 3-6, 6-4, 0-0. Krejcikova holds for 4-1. Can Svitolina find something - anything - to stop Krejcikova’s seemingly relentless progress towards the last 16? Krejcikova just needs to hold serve and she’s through. Another break for Barbora Krejcikova! It’s 3-1 and she is crushing the ball all over the court now - mixing it up with the odd drop shot - and Svitolina seems to have little answer. Svitolina breaks back for 2-1! The Ukrainian isn’t going to go down without a fight. Now, to Court Philippe-Chatrier, where a shock is brewing: Barbora Krejcikova of the Czech Republic is 2-0 up against fifth seed Elina Svitolina in the second set, after winning the first set 6-3. The first set featured a 20-minute service game for Krejcikova which she eventually held. She has hit 30 winners so far. Cédric Pioline, on post-match interview duty, tells the 10th seed Schwartzman that the crowd love him. “It’s a very special place to me,” Schwartzman tells Pioline of his feelings for Roland Garros as the cheers ring out. “I’m very happy to be back, to play my best tennis again, and with a crowd. Last year was my best tournament here, but not many people could come [due to lockdown] and I’m very happy to play with a lot of people here this week. “I was thinking to play every single point, as many shots I can ... he [Kohlschreiber] was not playing a lot of tournaments since last year ... so I was thinking to play a long match ... at the end, he was not running very well. “Now we can have time to walk around Paris this afternoon. I’m very happy, because now I have two days [off] before the second week here in Paris. Everything is perfect right now.” The diminutive Argentinian smokes a forehand down the line, and seals an utterly dominant win against the 37-year-old German. Schwartzman, the Argentinian, is 5-1 up in his third set against Kohlschreiber on Court Suzanne Lenglen. He angles a beautiful cushioned volley across court, and a point later, he has his first match point ... he sends the ball long, though, and it’s back to deuce on Kohlschreiber’s serve. That was a very, very entertaining two hours of tennis. Muchova sends a forehand long and Stephens is through with a top-drawer performance. Can the 2018 runner-up do something special this year? Stephens gives Muchova a smile as they shake hands - and then a big round of applause as the Czech leaves the court. A great spirit between the players - and a fine display of hitting from both of them. Muchova hits a blinding forehand winner. Stephens answers straight back, and has two match points. Stephens speeds to 30-0 and is two points away from the last 16 ... Stephens breaks! 6-5 to the resurgent American now, and she can serve for the match. Schwartzman is now 3-1 up against Kohlschreiber and seemingly easing to a straight-sets win. Stephens v Muchova is a much more interesting spectacle. Lovely variation now from Stephens, who produces a drop shot of her own: Muchova sprints and gets it back, but Stephens clumps a confident volleyed winner back into the open court. She now has three break points! Stephens holds for 5-5. Krejcikova and Svitolina are playing a marathon first set - it’s 4-3 there at the moment, Krejcikova with the second break and serving for 5-3. Whoah! Fantastic forehand winner down the line, on the slide, from Muchova and she creates a sniff of a chance at 40-30 on the Stephens serve. And now she takes it to deuce with another excellently-judged drop shot. Another classy drop shot from Muchova early in this service game from Stephens. But Stephens moves to 40-15 with a tremendous, powerful forehand that Muchova - attacking the net - cannot get back. Muchova digs out the game for 5-4. It’s been excellent from both players, this match. And that is a really gritty and calm effort from Muchova to fight back from 15-40 down and take the game - and, effectively, stay alive in the tournament. Muchova wins a game point, but a fine, deep return from Stephens forces an error and we’re back to deuce. Muchova forces it back to deuce after a long rally! Very, very impressive. Neither player held back there, despite the importance of the point. Stephens eventually sends a forehand wide and Muchova has parity. Now, two break points for Stephens after a couple of errors from Muchova. Muchova saves the first and it’s 30-40. Huge point coming up, can Stephens break again? Krejcikova and Svitolina are level at 3-3 in their first set, both with a break. Now Muchova, showing plenty of fight, forces a break point and she gets it! She’s broken back for 4-4 in the second set, and Stephens has more work to do. Now a break point for Stephens against Muchova! Muchova can’t afford to lose this point. But she does, directing a backhand into the net. Stephens is well set now, a break up once again, 4-3 in the second set, already a set to the good. Schwartzman is two sets up now against Kohlschreiber: 6-4, 6-2. Musetti, meanwhile, has hit back to level at 1-1 in sets against Cecchinato: 6-3, 4-6. If you missed it, here is a news story from yesterday regarding the arrest of the Russian player, Yana Sizikova, over allegations of spot-fixing in last year’s French Open: It’s 3-3! Stephens holds serve to draw level in the second set. Muchova has tightened up her game and is making life much tougher for Stephens now. The American puts a backhand into the net for deuce in the sixth game of the second set. Following a washout at Lord’s yesterday, it’s game on in St John’s Wood this morning in the first England v New Zealand Test match. Tim de Lisle is covering the action here: It’s been extremely high-quality tennis here, so much so, it’s a big surprise when Muchova tamely finds the net with a backhand from the baseline. That makes it 30-30 and it’s a chance for Stephens: but now the American puts a shot of her own into the net from the back of the court for 40-30 to Muchova. Muchova closes out the game and it’s 3-2 to the Czech in the second set. Muchova now advances to the net and produced a lovely angled drop, then smacks a backhanded winner for 30-0. She’s on top right now. Stephens answers back, dispatching a fine backhand winner on a short ball. She’s done it! Stephens chases down a drop shot, opening up the right of the court, and Muchova passes to break back! Great point, and a great game. It’s 2-2 in the second set and Muchova is back in it! Muchova is noticeably timing the ball a lot better in the last few games, really starting to get a feel for it. Muchova gets it wrong again. She’s had four break points so far in this match and converted none of them. Now, here’s a fifth ... can she do it? Now, a chance for Muchova to break back ... she gains advantage on Stephens’ serve, but then inexplicably sends a forehand well wide. But next up, Muchova digs out a stunning volley at the net for another break point! On Court Philippe-Chatrier, the fifth seed Svitolina has started her match against Krejcikova. Schwartzman leads Kohlschreiber 3-1 in their second set (the Argentinian also won the first set, 6-4), while Musetti is 4-3 up on Cecchinato in that second set. A perfectly-judged drop shot from Muchova and she’s on the board in the second set, at 2-1 to Stephens. Stephens has fallen down the rankings of late - according to the commentators, in fact, she won just four matches throughout the whole of 2020 - but this performance has been well above her current ranking of 59 in the world. Muchova hasn’t played badly but Stephens has exerted control with every area of her game. Stephens holds comfortably for 2-0 in the second set. Muchova is very much second best here. Muchova has won just one out of 11 points when she’s come to the net, so she probably needs to rethink that tactic. Muchova sends a forehand long, after another entertaining rally, to seal a Stephens break at the start of the first set! Trouble for Muchova. Schwartzman wins the first set against Kohlschreiber, 6-4. Stephens wins the first set, 6-3! This has been a really interesting and engaging contest: Muchova has been mixing things up with a few clever drop shots, but Stephens has generally been in the ascendancy, taking every advantage with her accomplished forehand and showing ability to dictate the terms of many of the rallies from the baseline. Muchova moves to 40-0 on her serve, including a drop shot that flicks off the net cord (Muchova raising a hand by way of apology), and a lob which Stephens decided not to play but drops just inside the tramlines. Muchova then seals a love hold with another drop shot - and the American Stephens will serve for the first set at 5-3. Schwartzman is really making Kohlschreiber work to hold serve in that first set, but the German finally does it, and it’s 5-4 to the Argentinian who will try to serve it out now. Cecchinato wins his first set against Musetti, 6-3. The Stephens forehand is causing Muchova plenty of issues. The American earns a second advantage - and wins the game when the Czech sends a volley long. The umpire gets out of his seat and jogs to the back of the court to check the mark, raises his finger in confirmation, and it’s 5-2 to Stephens in this very engaging first set. Muchova takes it deuce on Stephens’ serve. Muchova then wins a break point with a fine, powerful forehand into the corner on her opponent’s backhand side. But Stephens then saves the break point with a big forehand of her own which Muchova can only dump in the net. On court, Stephens and Muchova both hold serve, and it’s 4-2 in the first set. Kohlschreiber is serving to stay in the first set against Schwartman at 3-5. Sloane Stephens has had a terribly tough year, having lost two grandparents and an aunt to Covid-19, and has said that she wishes she had attended her grandparents’ funeral instead of being in isolation ahead of the Australian Open: “I should have asked to go to my grandparents’ funeral,” she told the New York Times earlier this week. “I should have made those inquiries and seen if I could get out of the bubble and go home. I didn’t. It’s something that I’ll probably regret for the rest of my life, because I prioritized my tennis over things that were happening in my life. The only thing I can do now is move on and move forward. There’s nothing wrong with having a therapist or two and a grief counselor and all of these things. I have to do what’s best for me and work on myself.” Schwartzman has broken Kohlschreiber, to go 4-2 up, and now Stephens breaks Muchova for 3-1 in the first set! Elsewhere in the men’s singles, Marco Cecchinato is 4-2 up on Lorenzo Musetti on Court 7. Stephens wins a break point with a lovely sliced backhand down the line. Muchova saves it with a delicate (and brave) drop shot - a much better effort than her previous one. Stephens is seeing it - and hitting it - remarkably well. She wrests control of a rally with a booming backhand, crosscourt, and finishes off the point in style. She is dictating the terms more often than not. Schwartzman and Kohlschreiber are under way on Suzanne Lenglen and it’s 2-2 in the first set. Stephens wins four points in a row to hold her second service game, and it’s 2-1 in the American’s favour against Muchova. Muchova finally manages to hold: she had to work for that, and this is shaping up to be a closely-fought - and very entertaining - affair. 1-1. Muchova tries a drop shot for the first time but Stephens runs it down easily and puts away a forehand winner. Back to deuce. Muchova is now having to work to hold her first service game. Stephens takes it to deuce after a marathon rally, both players hitting wonderfully well early in this match. Muchova grabs advantage, but Stephens stays aliver with an excellent forehand on to Muchova’s toes as the Czech comes forward, and she can only direct it into the net. Sloane Stephens holds serve against Karolina Muchova to begin their third-round match. It was an interesting first game, with both players hitting the ball sweetly and powerfully. Muchova produced one brilliant clean backhanded winner on Stephens’ second serve, but Stephens generally had the best of the rallies and she is on the board in solid style. Here is Tumaini Carayol’s report from yesterday, including Serena Williams’ win against Danielle Collins, as well as Aryna Sabalenka’s defeat by Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova: Sloane Stephens v Karolina Muchova (seeded 18) is first up on Court Simonne Mathieu, a match I will focus on to begin with. I’ll bring you live scores from across the other courts, of course. If you have any thoughts on the day’s action, you can drop me an email or tweet @LukeMcLaughlin. As the days tick by at Roland Garros and the field thins out, the big guns are naturally becoming more noticeable in the order of play: the men’s singles today sees Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal take to the clay for their third-round matches. Nadal, the 13-times French Open champion, will go into battle later today against Cameron Norrie, the British No 2, while Djokovic takes on Ricardas Berankis of Lithuania and Federer meets the left-handed German Dominik Koepfer. British fans will be fascinated to see how Norrie gets on: he was impressively consistent in his second-round win against Lloyd Harris, but will he have the weapons to trouble the king of clay? We will find out from around 1.15pm. In the women’s competition, a few big names have admittedly fallen early: Naomi Osaka withdrew, sparking a global debate about mental health and media coverage which rumbles on, while Ash Barty, the world No 1, was forced to retire from the tournament with a hip injury. The reigning champion Iga Swiatek of Poland is still very much in contention, however, in ominous form, and is clearly feeling increasingly confident about a second title. Swiatek faces a potentially tricky tie against 30th seed Estonian Anett Kontaveit this afternoon, scheduled on court at 3pm. Barbora Krejcikova will be the opposition for Elina Svitolina (5) on Philippe-Chatrier from 11am, while the fourth seed Sofia Kenin meets her American compatriot Jessica Pegula on Court Suzanne Lenglen. Coco Gauff v Jennifer Brady is another all-American affair from 3.15pm. There is light cloud covering Paris at the moment but no rain is expected, and the sun is scheduled to peep through the clouds later in the day.

It was dry overnight, though, and the blue skies over the downs are hopefully here for the duration of the day’s racing, which will mean a slow but steady drying of the surface as the afternoon goes on.</p> <p><strong>The Derby itself is at 4.30pm BST</strong>, by which time the track may be riding closer to good than the current good-to-soft, and while Bolshoi Ballet remains a rock-solid favourite at around 11-8, there is some jostling for position immediately behind Aidan O’Brien’s colt in the market.</p> <p>Mac Swiney, who won the Irish 2,000 Guineas on testing ground last time out, was a clear second-favourite at 6-1 after Friday’s rain but is now out to 9-1 as nothing more has arrived overnight. That could be an over-reaction, though, as Bolger told me earlier this week – in a quote that did not make <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/jun/04/jim-bolger-mac-swiney-epsom-derby-horse-racing\">the final cut</a> – that he has no concerns about his runner needing easy ground to be at his best.</p> <p>“The conditions played into his hands because of his stamina,” Bolger said, “but I don’t believe it has anything to do with a liking for soft ground.

The concern for favourite backers is that the Classic was her first attempt at a mile and today’s trip is a little further still, but the drop in class is significant and a repeat of her run to finish a close second in the Fred Darling in April would make her tough to beat. She is not the only runner dropping back from the highest level, however, as Nazuna was last seen finishing 10th of 14 in the Grade One Breeders’ Cup Juvenile Fillies’ Turf in November, having previously run the very useful Isabella Giles to two lengths in the Rockfel at Newmarket. Maamora, the probable pacemaker, could also have quite an easy time of it in front and needs to be considered, while Parent’s Prayer also has snippets of form last year that would give her a chance.

I love this painting of the William Haggas string at Newmarket, and the trainer will be hoping for a winner in the Derby with 9-1 shot Mohaafeth. Frankie Dettori has taken over the mantle of Lester Piggott (whose mount back in the day was labelled in what would now not pass muster the ‘housewives choice’). Everyone wants to know who he’s riding, many want to back him and the pre-Derby run-up usually involves another jockey being “jocked off”, as was the case this year when he switched to today’s ride, John Leeper, after Aidan O’Brien decide to have only one runner. That’s even truer after the jockey’s amazing Oaks victory yesterday. Ladbrokes spokesperson Nicola McGeady reports: “The horse we do not want to win is John Leeper, with Frankie fans praying he lands a Classic double.” You can still find some 10-1 but ‘the Leeper’ is down to 17-2 with SkyBet. A spokesperson from BritishGambler.co.uk stated: “John Leeper in the last 24 hours has taken 19% of bets, which is a fair amount and shows that punters are looking from someone to take on the favourite Bolshoi Ballet. A Frankie win would be any bookmaker’s worst nightmare as payouts will be over and above what they’d expected.” Hurricane Lane is the other attracting cash, now as short as 5-1 with some firms, having been as big as 8-1 on Friday night. Some of you will be having a go at the ITV7 or backing in other races at Epsom. Here are your non-runners with Caspian Prince, who won the race in 2014, 2016 and 2017, a significant absentee in the ‘Dash’ Stakes at 3.45pm due to the going: Epsom non-runners 2.00 4 Camelot Tales (going) 2.35 4 Posted (going), 7 Illykato (going) 3.10 9 Maximal (going), 7 Prince Eiji (going) 3.45 5 Caspian Prince (going), 12 Rose Hip (going) 5.15 1 Lost Eden (going), 6 Koeman (going) 5.50 1 Danzeno (going), 6 Justanotherbottle (temperature), Canagat (going), 12 Open Wide (going), 14 Indian Sounds (going) Tips are always flying around for the biggest day in the Flat racing year and everyone is usually interested in the Amato pub selection at the famous Epsom wishing well. Of course the tipsters at that particular watering hole have a long losing run to overcome ... Not jealous at all ... The British weather has been notoriously changeable this spring and yesterday’s atrocious conditions when Snowfall sluiced through the rain-softened ground to record a record Oaks-winning distance have given way to brilliant sunshine and we seem set fair for a blazing afternoon at Epsom. The official going is good-to-soft now but it could be good by the time of the Derby as Greg, who is there, has pointed out. Greetings from the home of the Derby, where what is sure to be the second-lowest attendance in the Classic’s history – 4,000 spectators – is starting to gather for the 242nd running of the world’s most famous Flat race. And what a splendid day it is after the unexpectedly damp experience that was Oaks day 2021, an afternoon that was immeasurably brightened by Snowfall’s 16-length romp in the fillies’ Classic but which also saw the going change from good, good-to-firm in places to good-to-soft all over after 11.8mm of rain. The forecast was for around 3-4mm, which was particularly unfortunate as Andrew Cooper, the clerk of the course, had been watering the track earlier in the week in case it went the other way. It was dry overnight, though, and the blue skies over the downs are hopefully here for the duration of the day’s racing, which will mean a slow but steady drying of the surface as the afternoon goes on. The Derby itself is at 4.30pm BST, by which time the track may be riding closer to good than the current good-to-soft, and while Bolshoi Ballet remains a rock-solid favourite at around 11-8, there is some jostling for position immediately behind Aidan O’Brien’s colt in the market. Mac Swiney, who won the Irish 2,000 Guineas on testing ground last time out, was a clear second-favourite at 6-1 after Friday’s rain but is now out to 9-1 as nothing more has arrived overnight. That could be an over-reaction, though, as Bolger told me earlier this week – in a quote that did not make the final cut – that he has no concerns about his runner needing easy ground to be at his best. “The conditions played into his hands because of his stamina,” Bolger said, “but I don’t believe it has anything to do with a liking for soft ground. He handles it very well, but before he ever ran we were always regarding him as a good ground horse and nobody was more surprised than I was when we found that he handles soft ground so well.” Hurricane Lane, the unbeaten winner of the Dante Stakes at York last month, has replaced Mac Swiney as second-favourite at a current top price of 6-1, while the lightly-raced “dark” horses Mohaafeth and John Leeper are out to 9-1 and 10-1. There are several potential history-makers connected to runners in the 12-strong field, including Aidan O’Brien, who would become the most successful trainer in the British Classics if Bolshoi Ballet obliges the punters and gives him a 41st success (and ninth in the Derby). Bolger, meanwhile, would be the oldest Derby-winning trainer at 79 years of age (as far as anyone can tell, at any rate, as records are a little sketchy in the race’s earlier years), and Ed Dunlop would become the first trainer to saddle a Derby winner named after his dad if John Leeper puts his name on a list which also includes Shirley Heights (1978) and Erhaab (1994), who were saddled by his namesake. And while it would not be entirely unique, Joseph O’Brien would become the first person to win a Derby as both a trainer and jockey since Harry Wragg in 1961 if the outsider Southern Lights pulls off a shock. His colt was only sixth behind Bolshoi Ballet in the Derrinstown last time but had all sorts of trouble in running there and should not be dismissed out of hand. It is one of the great days in world racing, the crowd is back – well, a bit of a crowd, at least – and the race itself returns to the first Saturday in June after being bounced into July 11 months ago. You can follow all the action here as it unfolds, and back or rule out my picks for the TV races as you please.

Brett Hutton has taken two, including Sir Alastair caught behind for five. And the Northern Diamonds have beaten Sunrisers by nine wickets in the RHF Trophy at Fenner’s chasing only 54. Bit of a thumping that. Sorry, no, a lot of a thumping! Northamptonshire, in a scramble for a fifth batting bonus point, have fallen short of 400 against Kent at Canterbury, losing their last five wickets for 30 to slip from 362-5 to 392 out. Guess who’s taken five? Yep, Darren Stevens. Unbelievable. Marnus Labuschagne talking to the ECB Reporters Network after top-scoring with 63 in the second innings of Glamorgan’s win over Lancashire. Particularly interesting about the reverse swing ... “This morning, it was key for us not to lose back-to-back wickets. I think losing one was alright, but we needed to make sure that we consolidated and built a partnership. We were only two 20 to 30-run partnerships away from winning. It was nice to be out there for the winning runs. To do it the fourth innings when the ball has gone reverse, which is exciting to play against because it is something we don’t get much of in Australia in domestic cricket - to get through that period and to build a partnership with Chris Cooke to get to the end, was very satisfying.” Jeez, he looks a classy player. This is actually the first time Yorkshire fans have seen him in the flesh since he joined from Middlesex in late 2019. He has two 150 plus scores in four four-day matches for the county. 381-4. Play due to start at 1.10pm at Canterbury. Just up the road at Chelmsford, Nottinghamshire have moved to 293-9 in their first innings against Essex in the other game which saw no play due to rain yesterday. At New Road, Worcestershire are 159-5 in their second innings trailing Durham by 91. Jake Libby continues his excellent summer, however, with 78. Dawid Malan is 146 here at Headingley and batting in cruise control. Yorkshire 374-3. I don’t think I ever batted in second gear during a dodgy league career around the north west, never mind cruise control! You have to laugh. The only remaining unbeaten record in county cricket has disappeared. And the result was flashed up on the scoreboard here at Headingley, where cheers and claps rung out. Yorkshire 340-3 in the 92nd over, with Dawid Malan on 123 not out. Labuschagne, by the way, finished 63 not out. Derbyshire are chasing 309 to beat Warwickshire at the County Ground and thus claim their first win of the season at the eighth attempt. They have bowled the visitors out for 155 second time around this morning, with South African seamer Michael Cohen claiming five wickets. Glamorgan need eight to win with six wickets left. Be some collapse to blow it from there! Crikey, must be soggy at Canterbury. Further inspection at 12pm. Glamorgan nearly there – 168-4, needing 20 more. Marnus Labuschagne’s 46 not out represents a season’s best. Nothing for Joe Root and co to worry about this winter, hey! Gloucestershire 23-3 in their second innings at Grace Road, still trailing Leicestershire by 270. And Hampshire are 311 all out at Taunton, trailing by 49. Josh Davey finished with five-for. Plenty of wickets around the traps. Lewis McManus missed out on a hundred at Taunton, where Hampshire are 307-9 in their first innings, trailing by 53. In the Rachael Heyhoe Flint Trophy, Katherine Brunt has struck three times for the Northern Diamonds at Fenner’s. Sunrisers are 16-5. Early wicket at Cardiff. Luke Wood has just got Kiran Carlson caught behind. Glamorgan 153-4, needing 35. There’s also been a wicket at Headingley. Gary Ballance caught behind off the impressive off-spin of Jack Carson for 77. 280-3 in the 79th over. There will be a delayed start at Canterbury due to damp conditions following yesterday’s torrential rain. Thankfully, play is up and running everywhere else, including at Lord’s, where England have lost Joe Root early – 111-3. Initial eyes are focused towards Cardiff. Glamorgan 143-3, needing 45 more. Labuschagne there on 36. His highest score of the season so far is 44. Jonny Bairstow is at Headingley this morning. He has netted and done some running with Yorkshire’s strength and conditioning coach, Pete Sim. Bairstow is due to make a handful of appearances for Yorkshire in the Vitality Blast, which gets under way for them here on Thursday against Birmingham Bears. That game, if selected, will also be Tim Bresnan’s first appearance against Yorkshire since leaving them last summer. It’s shorts weather for the second day running at Headingley, a far cry from the snow which greeted us eight weeks ago today when Yorkshire faced Glamorgan in the season opener. I think I wore three jumpers that day and two coats – sat inside! Tanya, I seem to remember, even went out at lunch and took orders for hot water bottles from the local B&amp;M Bargains or Poundland. Anyway, I apologise for the early digression. Here, yesterday, was a day to long remember as Sussex’s debutant Dan Ibrahim became the youngest player to score a fifty in Championship history, aged 16 and 299 days. He looked the real deal in front of a near-2,000 crowd. His composure really stood out before he struck with his medium pacers as Yorkshire slipped to 95-2 in reply to 313. Unfortunately, things got much harder for the young buck and his mates as Dawid Malan and Gary Ballance shared an unbroken 177 and will resume this morning looking to put a young attack on the ropes from 272-2. Malan (103) brought up a serene century in the final over the day and Ballance has 74. If Yorkshire can complete victory, it is likely to put them back within a handful of points of Group Three leaders Lancashire, who are on course for defeat in a quite remarkable game at Glamorgan. On what Alex Davies has described as a “substandard” pitch, Glamorgan are 137-3 needing 50 more to win with Marnus Labuschagne unbeaten on 32. The only remaining unbeaten record in county cricket this summer looks set to disappear. Mind you, get Marnus out immediately this morning and it could be different. Given the weather up North, I was absolutely staggered to see no play in the Test at Lord’s and also at Canterbury and Chelmsford in the Championship yesterday. When play does resume, Northamptonshire will be 362-5 against Kent in the other Group Three fixture and Notts will be 248-6 against Essex in the Group One top-of-the-table clash. Worcestershire have it all to do in Group One at New Road against an emerging Durham; 151 behind with seven wickets remaining and Jake Libby 51 not out. Likewise for Derbyshire at the County Ground against Warwickshire. The Bears, at 132-7 in their second innings, lead by 285. Derby will have to post the highest score of the match to claim victory. In Group Two at Taunton, it’s relatively even between Somerset (360) and Hampshire (285-7). I’d just rather be Somerset, but Hampshire have Lewis McManus unbeaten on 91 chasing his second career hundred. Gloucestershire’s popular and profitable start to the season is in danger of coming to a juddering halt. Beaten by Surrey last week, they are on course for a second away defeat at Leicestershire. They are 5-1 second time around, trailing by 281 with Leicestershire still to bat again. Elsewhere, there are a trio of Rachael Heyhoe Flint Trophy games taking place. I will have a keen eye on the Northern Diamonds game against Sunrisers at Fenner’s. I covered the Diamonds’ win against Lightning at Kibworth on Monday, a low-scoring thriller.

The emails add to understanding of the evolution of Trump’s “big lie”, that his defeat by Joe Biden was the result of mass electoral fraud, and how it fuelled the deadly assault on Congress on 6 January. The Arizona emails were obtained by American Oversight, a legal watchdog, via a Freedom of Information request. They showed how Trump and his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, pushed officials to act and how a controversial election audit in Arizona’s most populous county came to be set up. Arizona, Pennsylvania and Georgia are prominent among states which produced Biden victories Trump and his supporters insist won by fraud. They were not. Outside the White House in Washington on 6 January, Trump told supporters to “fight like hell” and march on the Capitol, where the election result was being confirmed. A mob stormed the building, some looking for lawmakers including Vice-President Mike Pence to capture and possibly kill. It led to Trump’s second impeachment, in which he was acquitted thanks to Senate Republicans. But perhaps more damagingly to Trump the riot prompted his suspension from major social media platforms – a decision Facebook upheld on Friday. Explaining how Trump might be allowed back, Facebook’s vice-president of global affairs, the former British deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, said the social media giant would “evaluate external factors, including instances of violence, restrictions on peaceful assembly and other markers of civil unrest. “If we determine that there is still a serious risk to public safety, we will extend the restriction for a set period of time and continue to re-evaluate until that risk has receded.” In response, Trump hinted that he might run for the presidency again in 2024 – a year after his Facebook suspension will expire or be renewed. Trump remains overwhelmingly popular with the Republican base. He is also widely reported to have raised with advisers his belief that electoral fraud will be proved and he will be reinstated in the White House by August. He will not. The release of the Arizona emails showed how Trump pursued his claim of fraud after the election was called. Election day was 3 November. Biden was declared the winner four days later. The Democrat won by more than 7m votes and by 306-232 in the electoral college. That was the score by which Trump beat Hillary Clinton in 2016, a result Trump called a landslide. Regardless, Trump went on the offensive with a frantic legal effort to prove fraud, led by Giuliani and almost entirely laughed out of court. In one Arizona email released on Friday, dated 2 December, Karen Fann, the Republican state senate president, told two constituents she had spoken to Giuliani “at least six times over the past two weeks”. Threatened later in the month with being recalled from office by “the new patriot movement of the United States”, Fann wrote that the state senate was “doing everything legally possible to get the forensic audit done”. Republicans in Maricopa county, the most populous county in Arizona, mounted a controversial audit of ballots. Most analysts view the audit as part of a concerted attempt by Republicans in state governments to restrict access to the ballot or produce laws by which results can be overturned. “It is either a witting or unwitting effort to handcuff democratic self-governance,” David Becker, executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, told the Guardian this week. Daniel Ziblatt, a Harvard political scientist and co-author of the book How Democracies Die, said the failure of Trump’s attempts to prove fraud was prompting more extreme measures. “The lesson Republicans have learnt,” he said, “is they don’t really suffer any electoral consequences from their base pursuing this kind of thing. In fact, they’re rewarded for it. That’s very ominous.” In the emails released by American Oversight, Fann told the constituent threatening action against her she had been “in numerous conversations with Rudy Guiliani [sic] over the past weeks trying to get this done”. She added: “I have the full support of him and a personal call from President Trump thanking us for pushing to prove any fraud.” Fann also told a constituent concerned about the use of taxpayers’ money: “Biden won. 45% of all Arizona voters think there is a problem with the election system. The audit is to disprove those theories or find ways to improve the system.” The emails also show the involvement of Christina Bobb. A reporter for One America News Network, a rightwing TV channel praised by Trump, Bobb has raised funds in support of the Maricopa audit. Another fringe rightwing network, Newsmax, has said it will show Trump’s return to public speaking on Saturday evening, an address to the Republican party in North Carolina. Trump, who will be 75 on 14 June, is due to hold events in other battleground states. Jason Miller, a senior adviser, has said Trump will use such events to attack Dr Anthony Fauci, the senior public health official whose emails from the first days of the coronavirus pandemic were also released this week. In a statement, Austin Evers, executive director of American Oversight, said of Republican efforts in Arizona: “The more we learn, the more it becomes clear that this is not an audit, it’s a sham partisan crusade carried out by some of the most cynical actors our democracy has ever known. “With each new email, the paper trail confirms that the true goal of this process is to perpetuate Donald Trump’s big lie of a stolen election and to undermine faith in our democracy.”","charCount":"5876","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/martin-pengelly\">Martin Pengelly</a> in New York"},{"headline":"Coronavirus live news: ‘foolish’ for UK to reopen further, says adviser; India has 120,000 new cases","standfirst":"<p>Prof Stephen Reicher says 21 June reopening ‘major risk’; Hawaii sets vaccine target to drop quarantine requirements</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/04/france-to-allow-uk-tourists-to-enter-if-fully-vaccinated\">France to allow UK tourists to enter if fully vaccinated</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/jun/04/school-leaders-say-pupils-should-vaccinated-as-matter-of-priority\">Prioritise pupils, say UK school leaders</a></li><li> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul>","trailText":"Prof Stephen Reicher says 21 June reopening ‘major risk’; Hawaii sets vaccine target to drop quarantine requirements","byline":"Kevin Rawlinson (now) and Nicola Slawson (earlier)","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"693fbe46dd2ec06d0c6c2cfcde68224cb6b74611\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/693fbe46dd2ec06d0c6c2cfcde68224cb6b74611/0_0_5204_3124/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People maintain social distancing while waiting to get a Covid vaccine dose in Chennai, India\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People maintain social distancing while waiting to get a Covid vaccine dose in Chennai, India.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Arun Sankar/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure>","body":"<div id=\"block-60bb74f68f082e80569f7134\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-05T13:04:01.396Z\">2.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A further 471,939 vaccine doses have been administered in 24 hours in England, according to NHS England data.

That took the total in the country between 8 December 2020 and 4 June 2021 to 56,602,996. NHS England said 150,337 of the new administered shots were first doses, while 321,602 were second doses; taking the respective totals to 33,525,485 and 23,077,511. A record 600,000 vaccine doses were administered in Italy on Friday, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports, citing local authorities. That put the country in second place in Europe for the number of people fully vaccinated. “Yesterday was marked by a record number of injections in 24 hours which touched the 600,000 mark, while the number of doses administered crossed the 37 million mark,” the government body in charge of vaccinations said on Saturday. “Italy is in second place in Europe in terms of the number of people fully vaccinated, just behind Germany and ahead of France and Spain,” it added. According to AFP, it said Friday’s record vaccinations were in part due to an increase in the number of vaccination centres, which now stood at 2,666 against 1,500 at the start of March. About 800 new centres will be opened in the coming weeks. According to official government figures, 37m vaccine doses have been administered and 12.7 million people – or nearly 24% of the population aged older than 12 years – have been vaccinated. The pandemic has claimed 126,415 lives in Italy, where the number of cases and deaths has been falling steadily in recent weeks. The government has been slowly easing Covid restrictions, relaxing a night curfew and opening up indoor dining in restaurants and bars. Progress is being made towards a deal on an intellectual property waiver for Covid-19 vaccines at the World Trade Organization (WTO), the US trade representative Katherine Tai said on Saturday. Backers of a patent waiver for Covid vaccines say it would boost vaccine production and improve delivery to poorer countries. These countries are battling surges in Covid-19 infections and struggling to access vaccine supplies as well as diagnostics, therapeutics and medical devices. Tai pointed to a revised proposal from the original proponents of the waiver, led by India and South Africa, as well as principles the EU has come up with to guide how they would like to negotiate the issues, Reuters reports. In a surprise shift in May, the US moved to supporting a patent waiver, piling pressure on opponents such as the EU and Switzerland, where many drugmakers are based. Tai told reporters before a meeting of trade ministers in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum: We’re actually really encouraged to see more WTO members come forth with proposals on what they can support at the WTO with respect to intellectual property rules at the WTO and how they apply to the Covid vaccines. The latest draft from proponents of the waiver sets a time span for a waiver of at least three years and would allow the WTO’s 164 members to determine when it ends. A huge queue has formed outside a health centre in Harrow, in London, which is offering jabs to people aged 18 and over. Belmont health centre in Stanmore, Harrow, is open on Saturday to over-18s who are still waiting for their first vaccine and who live or work in Harrow. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is being administered all day at the walk-in clinic and people do not need to be registered with the practice to get their vaccine. National eligibility criteria in England states that only those aged 30 and over are invited for their first jab, and it is understood that health officials want to prioritise that cohort in Harrow rather than younger age groups, PA news reports. But the poster advertising the walk-in centre clearly states that people aged 18 and over can come along, and the majority of people waiting appeared to be in their 20s. By mid-morning, a huge queue had formed in the area of the health centre, with the line snaking around a car park and stretching down the street. Among them were 20-year-old students Jamie Lesser and Daniel Simmons who arrived at around 8.15am. Lesser said it will be a relief to get the jab, telling the PA news agency: “If all plans go ahead, clubs are going to open in three weeks’ time and we both have plans to go out.” He said he had clubbing plans for “about five days in a row” if nightclubs open, “making up for the last year and a half”. Lesser said he found out about Saturday’s walk-in through friends in a group chat who had forwarded on information about it. He said: To be honest we weren’t intending to give up the whole of the Saturday. We were going to go to the gym fairly early … Thought we’d get here very early to avoid the queue, which hasn’t been very successful. Simmons said that as soon as he saw the chance to get the jab, he thought he would “jump on it”, adding: “I want to get it as soon as possible really.” Queueing for his jab, Chand Shah, a 25-year-old accountant, said the walk-in centre was “heavily advertised” and he thought it was a “good idea” to get the vaccine before the possible further easing of restrictions on 21 June. Asked if he expected to get his vaccine so soon, he said: “No. I was expecting August to be honest.” Shah added: “I think if you get the vaccine you feel safer.” South Korea’s respect for intellectual property rights makes it an ideal partner for the United States as it seeks to decouple its supply chains from China and forge partnerships to manufacture coronavirus vaccines, a trio of US senators said on Saturday during a visit to Seoul. The Democrat senators Tammy Duckworth and Chris Coons, and the Republican senator Dan Sullivan, were in South Korea as part of their first official overseas trip since the pandemic began. After last month’s summit in Washington between Joe Biden and South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in – who was only the second international leader to be welcomed by Biden as president – the senators said their visit was sign of the importance Washington places on South Korea’s role in countering China and shoring up global supply chains amid the pandemic. Duckworth told a group of reporters: We can trust in the legal system here, and we can trust that our intellectual property rights will be protected. South Korea is a logical partner. This is critical whether it is manufacturing [computer] chips or pharmaceuticals. A day after Biden and Moon met, the US drugmakers Moderna and Novavax entered into a deal with South Korea for its Covid-19 vaccines to be manufactured in the country, which has been seeking to secure more and faster deliveries of US-made vaccines. Here’s a brief summary of the major recent developments: Going ahead with the UK’s planned reopening on 21 June would be “foolish” and a “major risk”, an expert on an advisory group to the UK government warned. Prof Stephen Reicher said there was enough evidence to say that one of the government’s four key tests for its road map out of lockdown has not been met. India recorded 120,529 new cases in 24 hours as its capital, New Delhi, undertook a partial easing of its lockdown. The city was preparing to deal with an infection peak of 37,000 cases a day, its chief minister said. Covid-19 policies risk leaving psychological and socioeconomic scars on millions of young people across Europe, with far-reaching consequences for them and society, a wide-ranging Guardian project has revealed. Taking a snapshot, the Guardian asked five members of Europe’s Generation Z how the worst global pandemic in a century has affected their lives, what they have learned and how they see their future after the pandemic. The boss of Airlines UK has complained about a lack of transparency and consistency in the government’s changes to travel rules. Tim Alderslade, the chief executive of the industry body that represents UK carriers, said ministers had not kept to promises over a “green watchlist” that would have given travellers increased warning about a country potentially coming off the safe list. His comments came after the government decided to move Portugal out of the green list and into the amber travel category. It means people arriving in the UK from Portugal after 4am on Tuesday will need to self-isolate at home for 10 days, a change that has left holidaymakers scrambling for expensive return flights in an attempt to beat the quarantine deadline. Speaking about the “green watchlist” proposal, Alderslade told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: It would be a list of countries that were on the cusp, [where] there was a risk that they would be moving from green to amber, so passengers were aware of that, it was fully transparent and they would be taking that risk when they booked. It was entirely to stop what happened last summer when countries were moving up and down off the corridor list on a weekly basis and we saw people stranded overseas and then desperate to come home again because they couldn’t afford to quarantine. It has caused complete pandemonium because we don’t have that watchlist that we were promised by the government and I think with the taskforce, the transparency is not there, we don’t know what has to happen for countries to move from green to amber, or amber to green for that matter. Everyone aged older than 12 years in specific postcode areas of the English county of Berkshire will be offered PCR testing over the next two weeks from Monday in an effort to tackle the spread of the Delta variant. Meradin Peachey, the director of public health for Berkshire West, said a “real concern” with this variant is that if it keeps circulating there may be more mutations. She told BBC Breakfast: What’s happened in the last couple of weeks, especially in the last week, we’ve noticed that a lot of cases now coming through we can’t link to any travellers, which means we now have community transmission. She said cases are mainly among young people, with “virtually nobody over 60 or anyone who has been vaccinated” affected. She added: If the variant spreads and becomes even more, it may mutate again and the big concern is that vaccines won’t work. We really want to get people tested and isolated if they’ve got the virus, stop the spread so that we can make sure the vaccination programme works. Earlier, Dr Mike Tildesley, a member of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (Spi-M) UK government advisory panel, said ministers had a “difficult call” to make. He told Times Radio: It’s a hard one. I’m going to be annoying and sit a little bit on the fence on this, as I don’t think it’s our role as epidemiologists to call that. I think the difficult thing that we have, the difficult situation the government have, is of course if you delay that then of course you’ll get a smaller subsequent wave. I mean, that’s the case with any control policy – if you leave them in for a longer period of time then it’s going to reduce cases. But, of course, if you delay that we know that negatively impacts businesses, people’s livelihoods, and so forth. So, this is the difficult call that they have to make, and all we can do is put together as much evidence as possible and say this is what we expect to happen if you relax on 21 June, this is what we may expect if you delay that by two weeks for example, or four weeks and so on, so they have all the evidence they can to make the decision. It is clear that it would be “foolish” and a “major risk” to go ahead with the 21 June reopening, an expert on an advisory group to the UK government has said. Prof Stephen Reicher said there was enough evidence to say one of the government’s four key tests for its roadmap out of lockdown had not been met, according to the PA news agency. The member of the Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours (Spi-B), which advises the government, said the criteria about the current assessment of the risks not being fundamentally changed by new variants of concern was “not upheld” due to the spread of the Delta variant. Reicher told the news agency: I think, by the government’s own criteria, it’s quite clear that it would be foolish to proceed on the data that we’ve got at the moment. The risk would be very great indeed. And of course it’s a balance of risks but I think it would be a major risk to go further in opening up. Again, I make the point that it is about data not dates, and if you make it too much about the dates then you box yourself into a corner and I think that’s what the government has done. Marton Aszalos, a Hungarian paramedic, and Eniko Tokacs-Mathe, a vet, had to cancel their wedding twice during the pandemic and are finally getting ready for their big day this summer as restrictions are lifted. Reuters reports that the couple, who met in 2016 at a clinic where Eniko was working and Marton was then a trainee, say the emotional rollercoaster of the past 18 months has been draining but has made their relationship stronger. Eniko told the news agency: Because of the pandemic, we had to replan our wedding for the third time; both its date and the venue. The pandemic has also had a serious mental and physical affect on my fiancé as he is an ambulance officer. Reuters reports that the couple held a civil ceremony a month ago and are preparing for a wedding party with more than 100 guests in the town of Makó, near the Romanian border. Eniko is from Transylvania and many of her relatives will cross to Hungary to attend. They have been rehearsing their waltz for the wedding night, after a photo shoot on a motor boat on the Danube. Eniko said: Before, I thought my main worries would be whether we manage the lift in the dance, whether my makeup and hair would look good. But now, I am just happy and hope that all the guests and relatives can make it in health and we can celebrate together. Many couples are relieved that with 53% of Hungarians vaccinated, they can now go ahead and get married, Reuters reports. Gabor Herendi, a wedding planner, usually handles 30 to 35 weddings a year. But, in 2020, about 70% were postponed to this year. After the long wait, “energies will be multiplied”, he said. Hawaii will drop its quarantine and testing requirements for travellers once 70% of the state’s population has been vaccinated, the Associated Press reports, citing the governor, David Ige. The state will also lift its requirement that people wear masks indoors once that level has been reached. The state health department website said 59% of Hawaii’s population had had at least one dose of a vaccine and 52% had finished their dosing regimen. The AP reports: The state is using its figures, and not those provided by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to calculate thresholds for lifting restrictions. The health department director, Dr Libby Char, said that’s because Hawaii’s numbers are more accurate. She said it appeared the CDC had been counting some of Hawaii’s doses twice. Right now, travellers arriving from out of state must spend 10 days in quarantine or, to bypass that quarantine, they must show proof of a negative test taken before departure for the islands. Once 60% of Hawaii’s population is vaccinated, Ige said, the state will allow travellers to bypass a quarantine requirement as long as they can prove they were vaccinated in the US. Restrictions on travel between the islands will open up before that. Ige said that as of 15 June, people will be able to fly inter-island without taking a test or showing proof of vaccination. Also on that date, those who have been vaccinated in Hawaii may bypass quarantine when returning from a trip out of state. Russia has reported 9,145 new cases, including 2,897 in Moscow, taking the official national tally since the pandemic began to 5,117,274. According to Reuters, the government’s taskforce said 399 people had died in the past 24 hours, pushing the national death toll to 123,436. Taiwan has reported 511 new domestic cases, including 35 cases added to totals for recent days. That is up from the 472 domestic infections reported on Friday, Reuters reports. The agency also reports that Taiwan is in talks with US companies about making their vaccines, following similar talks with European firms, citing the health minister Chen Shih-chung. Taiwan, like much of the world, has been trying to speed up its vaccination programme following a spike in domestic cases, but has been stymied by global supply shortages. Chen told reporters that they previously had talks with European companies he did not name about producing their vaccines under licence. “Only recently have we started to have talks with US companies to see if it’s possible or not to carry out relevant subcontracting work,” he added, without providing details. Taiwan has ordered around 5m shots from the US firm Moderna, of which 150,000 have arrived. It has ordered 10m shots from the British-Swedish firm AstraZeneca. Taiwan, also in talks with BioNTech, blames China – which claims the island as its own territory – for blocking a deal with the German company earlier this year. Johnson &amp; Johnson said on Friday it had been in talks with Taiwan about providing its vaccine since last year. The number of confirmed cases in Germany increased by 2,294 to 3,697,927, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) shows, while the reported death toll has risen by 122 to 89,148. Mexico recorded 206 more deaths on Friday, bringing the total death toll to 228,568, its health ministry has said. Separate government data recently published suggests the real death toll may be at least 60% above the confirmed figure, Reuters has reported. Victoria, Australia’s second most populous state, has reported a small increase in locally acquired cases, as authorities hunt for the source of a new cluster of a highly infectious variant. Reuters reports: Five new local cases were reported, taking Victoria’s total to 70 in the latest outbreak, as the state capital, Melbourne, entered its second weekend of a hard lockdown, due to end on 10 June. Curbs were eased for the rest of the state on Friday. Saturday’s count was up from four new locally acquired cases on Friday. Authorities were alarmed after detecting the highly infectious Delta variant for the first time in Melbourne, sparking concerns cases could surge. There are now seven known cases in the city. The Delta variant, which has been classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as among the four variants of concern due to evidence that it spreads more easily, probably caused the latest devastating outbreak in India. Snap lockdowns, regional border restrictions and strict social distancing rules have helped Australia rein in prior outbreaks and keep its numbers relatively low at just 30,150 cases and 910 deaths. Victoria’s outbreak, which began on 24 May, has spurred people to join long queues for vaccinations following a slow rollout since February. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, said 20% of the adult population had now had a first dose of a vaccine. India’s capital city is preparing to deal with an infection peak of 37,000 cases a day in future, its chief minister has said, as the country as a whole reports 120,529 new cases over the last 24 hours. According to the Reuters agency, New Delhi’s political leader Arvind Kejriwal announced a partial easing of a lockdown, while the city is also preparing for oxygen storage capacity of 420 tons, and will set up genome sequencing labs to study coronavirus variants. Citing the federal health ministry, the agency reported 3,380 more deaths across India in 24 hours and said the tally of infections stood at 28.69 million and the death toll at 344,082.","charCount":"19687","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/kevin-rawlinson\">Kevin Rawlinson</a> (now) and <a href=\"profile/nicola-slawson\">Nicola Slawson</a> (earlier)"},{"headline":"Black Midi review – punk-jazz power is a recipe for success","standfirst":"<p><strong>St John at Hackney, London</strong><br>The London rockers pack a punch with a thunderous recital of their new album.

Every face is an inch or two high on my laptop screen, and trapped inside a rectangle. The rectangles form a wall of faces that builds up brick by brick. As each new face arrives, the wall shifts and rearranges itself. Outside, in the real world, other people’s faces have been frustratingly elusive, half-hidden by masks. Or they have averted their gaze, focused on completing their essential journeys and not wishing to exchange their spittle with mine. But here the faces keep coming, popping up magically from wherever they are in the world, happy to be seen.</p> <p>During lulls in meetings, my eyes scan the virtual room. You can look long and hard at people’s faces online in a way that would be rude in real life. I have never before paid this much attention to how a hairline runs along the top of a forehead, or an eye sits in its socket, or a jawline segues into a neck. I hadn’t noticed how vulnerable faces are – so soft, fleshy and bruisable – and how mercurially they move between moods. The faces look by turns dazed, dogged, sweetly attentive, full of faraway thoughts that no one could guess at, and as if they are trying hard to be bright-eyed and smiley but might suddenly dissolve into tears. It’s been that kind of year.</p> <p>Encountering faces like this feels oddly intimate, but also inadequate. All the intricate topography and chiaroscuro of their features is gone. Some faces are right in front of a window, which bathes them in impenetrable shadow. Others are too near the screen and blanched by its blue-light glow. Others move jumpily, out of sync with their speech, or freeze mid-flow, with eyes closed and mouth open, as if in ecstatic prayer.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Babies just 10 minutes old prefer a picture of a face to other images</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Strangest of all, none of these faces ever returns my gaze. We can’t maintain eye contact because we are looking at our screens, not our webcams. The whites of human eyes are bigger than those of other animals, which allows us to pick up on where they are looking, a vital social cue. Even when those eyes are no bigger than full stops on your screen, you can still tell when they are not looking at you.</p> <p>We are born hungry for other people’s faces. Babies less than 10 minutes old have been shown to prefer a picture of a human face to other images. Our brains are so eager to spot faces that this accounts for the most common form of pareidolia, the human tendency to make meaningful shapes out of random patterns. People can’t resist seeing faces in cloud formations, knobbly tree trunks, house frontages, pieces of toast… All it takes is the barest suggestion of two eyes and a mouth. The brain does the rest.</p> <p>What makes faces so compelling is that each one is both reassuringly familiar and utterly distinctive. The design template hasn’t changed for millennia. The faces of bodies found in bogs, centuries old but preserved by the peat, have chin stubble, furrowed brows, laughter lines and bags under their eyes. Those faces are just like ours, while remaining definitively their own. Every face is made of the standard-issue raw materials of skin, bone, muscle, cartilage and fatty tissue. It has the same roughly oval shape and the same classic arrangement: eyes and ears spaced to allow us to see and hear in stereo; nose above the mouth to reduce the chances of choking; jaw and mouth built for eating, speaking and grinning. And still every face manages to be as original as a fingerprint.</p> <p>The philosopher Emmanuel Levinas believed that looking at other people’s faces was how we learned to be human. Every face we meet, he thought, reminds us that we share the world with people who are fundamentally like us but who are also, like us, irreducibly unique. Levinas was inspired by the Talmud, the book of Jewish laws and teachings, which says that God “coins all people from Adam’s die and not one looks like another”.</p> <p>Recognising other people’s faces is a basic building block of social life. Most of us do it instantly and effortlessly. We can identify someone we know from a childhood photo of them, and someone we haven’t seen for years even though their face is now a saggy, wrinkled version of the one we knew. No one knows exactly how this virtuoso human skill works, but it seems to involve making a rough calculation about how the face knits together as a whole, rather than ticking off all the individual elements. That is why composite faces of criminal suspects are such bad likenesses. An eyewitness tries to recreate a face by choosing from a collection of parts – but we read faces more intuitively and impressionistically than this.</p> <p>The problem with being so good at reading faces is that we over-read them. The neurons in the temporal and frontal lobes of our brains just start firing and making on-the-spot calculations, behind which sit unconscious biases. Multiple studies have pointed to the “attractiveness halo effect” – people with good-looking faces are seen as more competent, cleverer and nicer than the norm. As the internet and the smartphone have made it easy to share images of our faces, these snap judgments have become part of daily life. Social media companies know that other people’s faces are human catnip and they use them to generate clicks. It’s called Facebook for a reason. Showing your face is part of the business model.</p> <p>Out of a mix of shyness and cussedness, I mostly refuse to join in. I have never taken a selfie and hate having my picture taken if it will be posted online. I once persuaded a reluctant publisher that my author photo should be a picture of my hand holding a pen. My Twitter avatar is an image of the animated children’s television character Mr Benn. In a marketised culture that values the free flow of harvestable data, my reluctance to show my face marks me out as eccentric, even suspect. “Please tell us why you don’t want to supply a profile picture,” one social media platform nags me, sounding not so much angry as disappointed. “No professional headshot needed!” says another, breezily. “Just something that represents you.”</p> <p>I am old enough to remember when you had to meet someone to find out what they looked like. I feel like an alien, dropped into this new world of near-obligatory visibility. I still find it puzzling that people will happily upload photos of themselves to dating apps that allow anyone to say “like” or “nope” to their pictures, swiping away rejected matches as if they were brushing away a speck of dust.</p> <p>In Don DeLillo’s novel <em>Mao II</em>, a Salinger-like author emerges from three decades of seclusion by agreeing to have his picture taken. The photographer warns him that people will ‘‘absolutely question your right to look different from your picture’’. I have found this to be true. And I would rather not be reduced to some frozen, two-dimensional simulacrum of my face that countless strangers can see. I prefer it when my actual face interacts with other people’s actual faces. A face is protean. Eyes and lips are part-liquid and glisten with life. Skin changes colour and tone. A baffling variety of muscles works the face’s many movable parts. Our eyebrows convey a whole world of meaning. We make and remake our faces every moment of our lives.</p> <p>The neurologist and writer Oliver Sacks was painfully aware of this fluid, ungraspable quality of faces. He suffered from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/shortcuts/2018/jan/29/one-in-50-of-us-is-face-blind-and-many-dont-even-realise\" title=\"\">prosopagnosia</a>, or face blindness, which affects about 2% of the population. Prosopagnosiacs can’t identify people from their faces. Once, Sacks was grooming his beard while looking at what he thought was his reflection in a window. Slowly it dawned on him that there was another bearded man on the other side of the glass, wondering why this strange person was staring at him and preening himself. Sacks’s face blindness aggravated his already acute shyness. He avoided most social gatherings, knowing they would involve the embarrassment of failing to recognise people he knew well, or greeting strangers as old friends. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/30/oliver-sacks\" title=\"\">Sacks died</a> in 2015. He might have found Zoom, which always attaches a name to a face, a godsend.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I don’t think I will ever take faces for granted again</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>“Face blindness” is a misnomer, really. Prosopagnosiacs are in fact fierce noticers of faces, scanning them carefully for idiosyncratic, telltale details like moles, wonky teeth and monobrows. They just can’t skip over the details to make that simple click of recognition. They look afresh at every new iteration of a face. When that face is lit from an odd angle, or its owner is feeling tired and drained, they might as well be looking at a completely new face – which in a sense they are. The rest of us process faces so quickly that we have stopped looking at them.</p> <p>After this year, though, I don’t think I will ever take faces for granted again. Now the world is reopening and once more filling up with faces – real, contoured, actual-size faces. As I pass people in the street, I hold their gaze for slightly longer than normal, perhaps because eye contact feels like a new-won privilege. I might just be projecting my own feelings on to them, but those faces look sober and chastened to me, aware of how swiftly the world can change and hopes can be dashed. I find myself agreeing with the Mexican priest in Graham Greene’s novel <em>The Power and the Glory</em>, who believes that when you look hard enough at other people’s faces, at the corners of their eyes and the shape of their mouths, you can’t help feeling tenderly towards them. Hate, he thinks, is “just a failure of the imagination”. Or perhaps just a failure to look.</p> <p>People younger than me have a phrase they use when conversing online: “I see you.” It can be used for everything from complimenting a friend on a new haircut to comforting them when they feel rejected or wronged. At heart it means “I have noticed your existence.” Now that we are locking eyes with each other again, I realise how much I have missed being “seen”. The other day I saw a friend outside the supermarket and we stopped to talk, maskless and a few feet apart, like we did in the before times. The face in front of me didn’t blur or pixellate like the ones on my laptop, nor was there any disconcerting time lag in the way it responded to mine. It just picked up where it left off a year ago, noticing my nods and smiles and mirroring them with its own – a wordless message I had almost forgotten how to read. Roughly translated it said: “I see you.”</p> <p><em>If You Should Fail: A Book of Solace by Joe Moran is published by Viking at £14.99.

A face is protean. Eyes and lips are part-liquid and glisten with life. Skin changes colour and tone. A baffling variety of muscles works the face’s many movable parts. Our eyebrows convey a whole world of meaning. We make and remake our faces every moment of our lives. The neurologist and writer Oliver Sacks was painfully aware of this fluid, ungraspable quality of faces. He suffered from prosopagnosia, or face blindness, which affects about 2% of the population. Prosopagnosiacs can’t identify people from their faces. Once, Sacks was grooming his beard while looking at what he thought was his reflection in a window. Slowly it dawned on him that there was another bearded man on the other side of the glass, wondering why this strange person was staring at him and preening himself. Sacks’s face blindness aggravated his already acute shyness. He avoided most social gatherings, knowing they would involve the embarrassment of failing to recognise people he knew well, or greeting strangers as old friends. Sacks died in 2015. He might have found Zoom, which always attaches a name to a face, a godsend. “Face blindness” is a misnomer, really. Prosopagnosiacs are in fact fierce noticers of faces, scanning them carefully for idiosyncratic, telltale details like moles, wonky teeth and monobrows. They just can’t skip over the details to make that simple click of recognition. They look afresh at every new iteration of a face. When that face is lit from an odd angle, or its owner is feeling tired and drained, they might as well be looking at a completely new face – which in a sense they are. The rest of us process faces so quickly that we have stopped looking at them. After this year, though, I don’t think I will ever take faces for granted again. Now the world is reopening and once more filling up with faces – real, contoured, actual-size faces. As I pass people in the street, I hold their gaze for slightly longer than normal, perhaps because eye contact feels like a new-won privilege. I might just be projecting my own feelings on to them, but those faces look sober and chastened to me, aware of how swiftly the world can change and hopes can be dashed. I find myself agreeing with the Mexican priest in Graham Greene’s novel The Power and the Glory, who believes that when you look hard enough at other people’s faces, at the corners of their eyes and the shape of their mouths, you can’t help feeling tenderly towards them. Hate, he thinks, is “just a failure of the imagination”. Or perhaps just a failure to look. People younger than me have a phrase they use when conversing online: “I see you.” It can be used for everything from complimenting a friend on a new haircut to comforting them when they feel rejected or wronged. At heart it means “I have noticed your existence.” Now that we are locking eyes with each other again, I realise how much I have missed being “seen”. The other day I saw a friend outside the supermarket and we stopped to talk, maskless and a few feet apart, like we did in the before times. The face in front of me didn’t blur or pixellate like the ones on my laptop, nor was there any disconcerting time lag in the way it responded to mine. It just picked up where it left off a year ago, noticing my nods and smiles and mirroring them with its own – a wordless message I had almost forgotten how to read. Roughly translated it said: “I see you.” If You Should Fail: A Book of Solace by Joe Moran is published by Viking at £14.99.

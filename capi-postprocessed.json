Frankly, We Did Win This Election: The Inside Story of How Trump Lost, by Mike Bender, senior White House reporter for the Wall Street Journal, will be published in August. News of its contents, including “some amazingly hilarious revelations” about Mike Pence, Rudy Giuliani, Roger Stone, Tucker Carlson, Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump “and the rest of the Trump posse”, was reported by Punchbowl News. According to the news site, the ad known to Trump insiders as “the Hannity ad” and “the one Hannity wrote” ran only during Hannity’s show. An anonymous Trump aide is reported as saying “Hannity said this is our best spot yet” but Bender reports: “Inside the campaign, the spot was mocked mercilessly – mostly because of the dramatic, over-the-top language and a message that seemed to value quantity over quality. “Donald Trump himself, in a post-election interview with Bender, did not dispute that Hannity wrote the ad, which called [Joe] Biden a ‘47-year swamp creature’ who had ‘accomplished nothing’ and supported a ‘radical, socialist Green New Deal’.” Hannity denied writing the ad, telling Bender: “The world knows that Sean Hannity supports Donald Trump. But my involvement specifically in the campaign – no. I was not involved that much. Anybody who said that is full of shit.” Joe Biden is now en route to Tulsa, Oklahoma, where he will commemorate the 100th anniversary of the city’s race massacre. The president did not stop to take questions from reporters as he boarded Air Force One for the trip to Tulsa, where he will meet with massacre survivors and deliver remarks to honor the victims of the violence. The Washington Post has obtained more than 800 pages of emails to and from Anthony Fauci, the senior US health official who is now chief medical adviser to President Joe Biden, during the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic last year. The paper reports that the emails offer a window into the chaos, panic and confusion of the time, and of the considerable difficulties Fauci faced as a prominent figure in a Covid task force serving Donald Trump. As Fauci recently told the Post, “I was getting every single kind of question, mostly people who were a little bit confused about the mixed messages that were coming out of the White House and wanted to know what’s the real scoop. “I have a reputation that I respond to people when they ask for help, even if it takes a long time. And it’s very time consuming, but I do.” The Post obtained the emails through the Freedom of Information Act. Some exchanges are with George Gao, a top Chinese health official. “Lets work together to get the virus out of the earth,” Gao says in one message. “We will get through this together,” Fauci replies. US-China tensions have been high throughout the pandemic but the US is now investigating whether the virus, discovered in Wuhan province, came from animals, as has been the scientific community’s position for some time, or whether there is truth to the theory that the virus was being studied in a laboratory and escaped. In a column for the Guardian on Tuesday, the author Thomas Frank said that if true, the laboratory leak theory “is the kind of thing that could obliterate the faith of millions” of Americans who have followed government advice throughout the pandemic. In another exchange between Fauci and Gao, the Chinese official refers to “some news (hope it is fake) that [you] are being attacked by some people. Hope you are well under such [an] irrational situation”. “Thank you for your kind note,” Fauci replies. “All is well despite some crazy people in this world.” Fauci was often at odds with Trump and others who sought to play down the severity of the threat to US public health. The scientist ended up having to hire security. Here’s our own interview with Fauci, published yesterday: Joe Biden is “finishing the job” begun by Barack Obama, the former president told the New York Times in an interview released on Tuesday. “I think that what we’re seeing now, is Joe and the administration are essentially finishing the job,” Obama said. “And I think it’ll be an interesting test. “Ninety per cent of the folks who were there in my administration, they are continuing and building on the policies we talked about, whether it’s the Affordable Care Act or our climate change agenda and the Paris [climate deal], and figuring out how do we improve the ladders to mobility through things like community colleges.” Obama also mused about Biden’s much-discussed ability to reach voters, particularly in post-industrial midwestern states, who voted Obama then switched to Donald Trump. “By virtue of biography and generationally,” Obama said, his vice-president, who is 78 and was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, “can still reach some of those folks”. “People knew I was left on issues like race, or gender equality, and LGBTQ issues and so forth,” Obama said. “But I think maybe the reason I was successful campaigning in downstate Illinois, or Iowa, or places like that is they never felt as if I was condemning them for not having gotten to the politically correct answer quick enough, or that somehow they were morally suspect because they had grown up with and believed more traditional values.” In fact Obama famously stirred controversy in 2008 when he said such voters “get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren’t like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations”. The New York Times interviewer did not raise those remarks. Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell once again defended Republicans’ decision to block the bill to create a bipartisan commission to study the January 6 insurrection. “I don’t think anybody’s going to get away with anything,” the Republican leader said in Kentucky today. “I think we’ll know everything we need to know. We were all witnesses, we were right there when it happened. And I simply think the commission is not necessary.” McConnell’s comments come four days after Senate Republicans blocked the commission bill from being taken up for debate, killing the legislation for now. Six Republicans joined their Democratic colleagues in voting to advance the bill, but Democrats needed 10 Republican votes to overcome a filibuster of the legislation. Alexandra Villareal reports for the Guardian: Republicans in Texas are already plotting to resurrect their fight for sweeping voting restrictions after Democratic lawmakers walked out of the state capitol and blocked an 11th-hour attempt to ram through legislation that would have made it harder to cast a ballot. The Texas governor, Greg Abbott – who leads the state’s domineering Republican majority – has announced he will include the high-stakes issue on his agenda when he reconvenes the legislature for a rapid-fire special session. He called the failure of the bill “deeply disappointing”. Abbott, who says “election integrity” remains an emergency in Texas, wields control over what is essentially legislative overtime, where lawmakers consider issues on a sped-up timeline. When the session will begin remains unclear. But advocates are still painting last night’s historic show of force as an inflection point for the Texas legislature and America, when Democrats shirked business as usual for aggressive tactics that matched the urgency of a teetering democracy. “The fight you saw last night is the fight that will remain and continue,” state representative Trey Martinez Fischer, a Democrat representing San Antonio, told the Guardian. “That’s our commitment.” Joe Biden’s visit to Tulsa comes almost exactly one year after Donald Trump traveled to the city to hold his first campaign rally since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, an event that sparked intense criticism and attracted protests. The AP notes: After suspending his campaign rallies because of the coronavirus pandemic, Trump, a Republican, chose Tulsa as the place to mark his return. But his decision to schedule the rally on June 19, the holiday known as Juneteenth that commemorates the end of slavery in the United States, was met with such fierce criticism that he postponed the event by a day. The rally was still marked by protests outside and empty seats inside an arena downtown. Trump arrived in Tulsa during a highly charged moment, days after he had ordered the forcible clearing of Lafayette Square across from the White House, with federal officers pushing out those peacefully protesting [George] Floyd’s death. Trump reflexively embraced law enforcement throughout his presidency and was frequently accused of using racist rhetoric when painting apocalyptic — and inaccurate — scenes of American cities. While in Oklahoma today, Joe Biden will meet with survivors of the Tulsa race massacre and visit the Greenwood Cultural Center. The center describes itself as “the keeper of the flame for the Black Wall Street era, the events known as the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, and the astounding resurgence of the Greenwood District in the months and years following the tragedy”. The Guardian’s Sam Levine reports: Conservative activists across America are pushing efforts to review the 2020 vote more than six months after the election, a move experts say is a dangerous attempt to continue to sow doubt about the results of the 2020 election that strikes at the heart of America’s democratic process. Encouraged by an ongoing haphazard review of 2.1m ballots in Arizona, activists are pushing to review votes or voting equipment in California, Georgia, Michigan, and New Hampshire. Meanwhile, in Wisconsin, the powerful speaker of the state house of representatives recently hired ex-law enforcement officers, including one with a history of supporting Republicans, to spend the next three months investigating claims of fraud. At least one of the officers hired has a history of supporting GOP claims. The announcement also came after state officials announced they found just 27 cases of potential fraud in 2020 out of 3.3m votes cast. The reviews are not going to change the 2020 election results or find widespread fraud, which is exceedingly rare. Nonetheless, the conservative activists behind the effort – many of whom have little election experience – have championed the reviews as an attempt to assuage concerns the 2020 election was stolen. If the probes don’t turn up anything, they will only serve to increase confidence in elections, proponents say. Joe Biden also released a statement yesterday to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Tulsa race massacre, calling on Americans to “recommit” to efforts to address systemic racism in the US. “On this solemn centennial of the Tulsa Race Massacre, I call on the American people to reflect on the deep roots of racial terror in our nation and recommit to the work of rooting out systemic racism across our country,” Biden said in the statement. The president noted that the federal government “must reckon with and acknowledge the role that it has played in stripping wealth and opportunity from Black communities”. The Biden administration announced today a series of initiatives aimed at narrowing the racial wealth gap in the US, including efforts to support affordable housing and minority-owned small businesses. Reflecting on the lives and businesses lost in Tulsa in 1921, Biden said yesterday, “We honor the legacy of the Greenwood community, and of Black Wall Street, by reaffirming our commitment to advance racial justice through the whole of our government, and working to root out systemic racism from our laws, our policies, and our hearts.” The full-page advert in a special Black History edition of USA Today presents a technicolor vision of modern-day Tulsa, with sparkling images of public parks and brightly-painted murals celebrating the local Black community under the banner headline: “Tulsa Triumphs”. “Tulsa is leading America’s journey to racial healing,” the text says, inviting visitors from across the US to sample the delights of Oklahoma’s second-largest city. The enticements include “an emotional opportunity for learning and reflection” and a “space for reconciliation… Tulsa triumphs, and you can be a part of this pilgrimage.” The advert is a brazen attempt to turn Tulsa’s grim distinction as the setting of one of the most grotesque mass lynchings in US history into a tourist draw. It is the work of the Tulsa Race Massacre Centennial Commission, a body of prominent state and city politicians and other local notables who have put together the city’s established version of the 100th anniversary of a very special day. On that day, 31 May 1921, white Tulsans ran amok, shooting any Black person in sight, dropping incendiary devices from the air onto their homes and burning to the ground one of the most flourishing Black business districts in the country, known as “Black Wall Street”. Some 35 blocks of Black real estate in the Greenwood neighbourhood were destroyed. At least 300 men, women and children were murdered. Over 24 hours, Tulsa witnessed what is thought to be the worst single event of white supremacist violence against African Americans in the nation’s history. From the terror of 31 May 1921 to the “triumph” of 31 May 2021 – it makes for a powerful attraction for visitors. The only hitch with this depiction of Tulsa rising from the ashes is that from the perspective of the Black survivors and many of the descendants of the massacre, it has no bearing in reality. Ahead of Joe Biden’s Tulsa trip, his administration also outlined how his American Jobs Plan will directly benefit communities of color. The president’s proposal includes a $10 billion community revitalization fund that will help fund community-led infrastructure projects and a $15 billion grant program to bolster transportation infrastructure. Biden has also called for the creation of a Neighborhood Homes Tax Credit to support the development of affordable housing and a $5 billion grant program to expand housing options for Americans with low or moderate incomes. Finally, the president has indicated he would like to invest $31 billion to expand efforts to support minority-owned small businesses. However, it is very unclear if any of these initiatives will make it into the final version of the infrastructure bill. Senate Republicans have proposed a $257 billion bill, much smaller than the $1.7 trillion infrastructure package that Biden is pushing, and it’s possible that proposals like those above may end up getting cut from the legislation.

That meeting will likely offer insight into the size and scope of the final bill. Greetings from Washington, live blog readers. Joe Biden will travel today to Tulsa, Oklahoma, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the city’s race massacre, which targeted affluent African Americans and their businesses. Ahead of the president’s trip, the White House announced this morning a series of new initiatives aimed at narrowing the country’s racial wealth gap. The administration pledged to take action to address racial housing discrimination and use its purchasing power to direct an additional $100 Billion to small disadvantaged business owners. The trip and the administration’s announcement come two weeks after three living survivors of the massacre -- Viola Fletcher, Hughes Van Ellis and Lessie Evelyn Benningfield Randle -- testified to Congress about the need to compensate massacre survivors and their descendants. “I am here seeking justice,” Fletcher said at the House subcommittee hearing. “I am here asking my country to acknowledge what happened in Tulsa in 1921.” The blog will have more details on the trip coming up, so stay tuned.","charCount":"16056","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/joan-greve\">Joan E Greve</a> in Washington"},{"headline":"Trent Alexander-Arnold named in England squad for Euro 2020 – live!","standfirst":"<ul><li>Updates and reaction as 26-man squad is unveiled</li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/jun/01/england-euro-2020-squad-named-alexander-arnold-in-lingard-and-watkins-out-gareth-southgate\">Full story: Lingard and Watkins among those missing out</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2021/jun/01/england-squad-euro-2020-gareth-southgate-final-26-in-pictures\">In pictures: Gareth Southgate’s Euro 2020 squad</a></li><li>And you can <a href=\"mailto:barry.glendenning@theguardian.com\">email Barry</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bglendenning\">tweet him</a> or comment below<br></li></ul>","trailText":"<strong>Live updates: </strong>News and reaction as Gareth Southgate delivers the final cut for England’s assault on the Euros.

Sign up now for our daily teatime email - it’s funny and it’s free. Well, it’s free. The sad six: Those who didn’t make the cut were offered the opportunity to leave the England camp and go home but it is being reported that not a single one have them have taken up the option. It’s the hope that kills you, as they say. On Sky Sports News, Michael Dawson is in the studio as a pundit and is completely baffled by the news that Jessie Lingard is likely to start against Austria tomorrow night. Himself, Jim White and Darren Bent don’t seem to know that the Chelsea, Manchester United and Manchester City contingent have not reported for duty yet. Unless I’m mistaken ... but I’m pretty sure I’m not. England admin: The jungle drums are reporting that, with the exception of the injured Mason Greenwood, the six players who have been cut from the provisional squad will stay in the camp for England’s friendlies against Austria tomorrow and Romania on Sunday. With the players of Manchester United, Manchester City and Chelsea all still on a break, Jessie Lingard is expected to play against Austria. #fourrightbacks isn’t trending on Twitter yet but it’s surely only a matter of time if a cursory glance at my Twitter feed is anything to go by. It’s Ollie Watkins I really feel for but he may well get an opportunity if one of those ahead of him in the pecking order gets injured in the next 10 days. Then I’ll really feel for them. So, the main talking points ... Ollie Watkins will be gutted to miss out, while Gareth Southgate makes the eyebrow-raising decision to bring four right-backs. The omission of Ben Godfrey, Ben White and Aasron Ramsdale is unsurprising and we already knew Jessie Lingard, Mason Greenwood and James Ward-Prowse would not be going. The inclusion of 10 defenders suggests Southgate will be playing a back five. Gareth Southgate will explain himself at 6pm. Goalkeepers: Dean Henderson (Man Utd), Sam Johnstone (West Brom), Jordan Pickford (Everton) Defenders: John Stones (Man City), Luke Shaw (Man Utd), Harry Maguire (Man Utd), Trent Alexander-Arnold (Liverpool), Kyle Walker (Man City), Tyrone Mings (Aston Villa), Reece James (Chelsea), Conor Coady (Wolves), Ben Chilwell (Chelsea), Kieran Trippier (Atletico Madrid) Midfielders: Mason Mount (Chelsea), Declan Rice (West Ham), Jordan Henderson (Liverpool), Jude Bellingham (Borussia Dortmund), Kalvin Phillips (Leeds) Forwards: Harry Kane (Tottenham), Marcus Rashford (Man Utd), Raheem Sterling (Man City), Dominic Calvert-Lewin (Everton), Phil Foden (Man City), Jack Grealish (Aston Villa), Jadon Sancho (Borussia Dortmund), Bukayo Saka (Arsenal) Southgate is bringing four right-backs Harry Maguire is in the squad Bukayo Saka has been selected Ben White and Ben Godfrey are out Jude Bellingham makes the cut Not long now: We’ve less than five minutes to go to a Big Reveal that is becoming increasingly small as a result of leaks and then the mouth-foaming and waving at clouds can begin. It is worth noting that while England have to submit their squad list to Uefa by 11pm, they can change it at any time up to the day before the tournament kicks off. Below the line: I seem to have misread the room. Assorted readers in the comments section are boldly claiming that finishing tenth, losing home and away to Newcastle and winning six out of 19 Premier League games at Goodison Park was in fact a tremendously successful campaign for Everton. More on Everton: The board of directors will meet tonight to discuss possible replacements for the departing Carlo Ancelotti. The names of David Moyes and Nuno Espirito Santo are already being bandied about. Jack Grealish: I had a nagging feeling that the Aston Villa winger might be a high profile omission from the squad; one that was probably misguided. The withdrawal of Mason Greenwood almost certainly means Grealish’s inclusion is guaranteed. My idea of the seven who will not be included: Jessie Lingard, Mason Greenwood, James Ward-Prowse, Ollie Watkins, Ben White, Aaron Ramsdale and Bukayo Sako. England are very lucky to be in a position where they can leave so many good players out. As a Republic of Ireland fan, I’d happily swaddle all seven of them in green. In unrelated news: Carlo Ancelotti is on the verge of leaving Everton for a return to Real Madrid, subject to the agreement of a compensation package between the two clubs. As much of a gentleman as he is, it’s difficult to imagine Everton fans being particularly upset by this bombshell news. They’ve had a very mediocre season despite remaining in contention for a top four spot until the closing weeks. The Champions League winner, Premier League winner and Ballon D’Or nominee will be included in Southgate’s 26-man squad, according to Sky Sports News. There are four right-backs in the provisional squad - does this mean all four will be picked or will one of Kyle Walker, Reece James and Kieran Trippier miss out? One suspects Trippier might be the most vulnerable if one of them is for the chop. All will be revealed at 5pm, unless all is leaked to the media in the next 54 minutes. Breaking the bad news: Different managers have different methods of telling players they’re being left out of the England squad ahead of major tournaments and not all of them go for the soft-soap approach. On TalkSport’s Breakfast Show this morning, Darren Bent revealed that Sven Goran Eriksson told him he wouldn’t be part of England’s squad for the 2006 World Cup squad in a curt phone call that lasted about 14 seconds. To add insult to injury, Bent later learned that the uncapped Theo Walcott had been picked ahead of him. At least Bent got the courtesy of a phone call – Ray Parlour said he found out Glenn Hoddle wouldn’t be taking him to 1998 World Cup on Teletext (kids, ask your parents). He said he took the rejection on the chin because he had extremely stiff competition in the form of David Beckham and Paul Scholes. Harry Maguire: Much of the reasoning behind Southgate’s selection will depend on the fitness of Harry Maguire, who damaged ankle ligaments during Manchester United’s win over Aston Villa three weeks ago. The centre-back may not be fit for the start of England’s Euro campaign but will almost certainly be selected unless his injury is more serious than the England camp have been letting on. Jordan Henderson, who has not played since 20 February, has been participating in recent England training sessions, alongside his fellow midfielder Kalvin Phillips, who gave England fans a fright when he was forced off with what initially looked a serious shoulder injury in the closing seconds of Leeds United’s Premier League campaign. The de-selection of James Ward-Prowse suggests there are no concerns over the fitness of either Henderson or Phillips. From David Hytner, our chief football correspondent: “The uncapped trio of the Sheffield United goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale, the Everton defender Ben Godfrey and the Brighton defender Ben White are not expected to make the cut with the England manager, who has trained without 12 of his provisional squad this week because of their European cup final commitments, regarding their call-ups as valuable experience. The Aston Villa striker Ollie Watkins and Arsenal’s Bukayo Saka could also miss out.” The provisional 33-man squad Tottenham Hotspur utility man Eric Dier, Leicester City midfielder James Maddison and injured Burnley goalkeeper Nick Pope were among the high profile absentees when Southgate named his provisional 33-man squad last week, while Trent Alexander-Arnold earned a recall following his controversial omission from the England squad in March. Brighton defender Ben White, his Everton counterpart and namesake Ben Godfrey were among four uncapped players named in Southgate’s provisional squad, along with goalkeepers Sam Johnstone and Aaron Ramsdale, who were relegated with West Brom and Sheffield United respectively. Goalkeepers: Dean Henderson (Man Utd), Sam Johnstone (West Brom), Jordan Pickford (Everton), Aaron Ramsdale (Sheff Utd) Defenders: John Stones (Man City), Luke Shaw (Man Utd), Harry Maguire (Man Utd), Trent Alexander-Arnold (Liverpool), Kyle Walker (Man City), Tyrone Mings (Aston Villa), Reece James (Chelsea), Conor Coady (Wolves), Ben Chilwell (Chelsea), Ben Godfrey (Everton), Kieran Trippier (Atletico Madrid), Ben White (Brighton) Midfielders: Mason Mount (Chelsea), Declan Rice (West Ham), Jordan Henderson (Liverpool), Jude Bellingham (Borussia Dortmund), Kalvin Phillips (Leeds), Jesse Lingard (Man Utd), James Ward-Prowse (Southampton) Forwards: Harry Kane (Tottenham), Marcus Rashford (Man Utd), Raheem Sterling (Man City), Dominic Calvert-Lewin (Everton), Phil Foden (Man City), Jack Grealish (Aston Villa), Mason Greenwood (Man Utd), Ollie Watkins (Aston Villa), Jadon Sancho (Borussia Dortmund), Bukayo Saka (Arsenal) Today’s the day.

Then Travaglia nets and the Australian is through. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a2d2f59ce9327ac6f54c80d75453cce16b29e66b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a2d2f59ce9327ac6f54c80d75453cce16b29e66b/0_0_4280_2911/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alex de Minaur is through in straight sets.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"680\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alex de Minaur is through in straight sets.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julian Finney/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-06-01T11:46:03.965Z\">at 12.46pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-60b615dc8f082e80569f2c55\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-01T11:13:03.370Z\">12.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>But no, </strong>Travaglia has broken back for 3-3 and it’s back with serve against De Minaur.

He begins his campaign for his 14th (fourteenth) title by meeting the Australian, Alexei Popyrin, on Philippe-Chatrier. </p> <p>Before that, the 2019 women’s champions and number one seed, Ashleigh Barty, takes on Bernarda Pera, the American-Croatian. </p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.rolandgarros.com/en-us/order-of-play?date=2021-06-01\"> Here’s the full order of play. </a></strong></p> </div>   </div>","wordcount":"4320","firstPublicationDate":"2021-06-01T09:00:48Z","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2021-06-01T16:37:44Z","liveBloggingNow":"true","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/p/hjdka","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/609e58a2b0bcd0aaaea4050fbbb6884752ec3982/39_0_3893_2337/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","isLive":"true","bodyText":"Gutsy from Popyrin. Staring down the barrell of another break at 15-40, then two further break points after that, he held his nerve throughout. Sure, there were unforced errors along the way - “like a boa constrictor,” said Jim Courier when it looked like Nadal was squeezing the life out of the 21-year-old - but he won’t back down! Predicably, Nadal swamps Popyrin after those myriad missed opportunities in the previous game, holding to 15. It’s 5-5. NADAL BREAKS BACK! What a wild ride that game was! Popyrin looked to be bottling it at 15-all when missing the most basic volley but bounced straight back to nail the perfect drop shot before slamming home a tough overhead. Set point... double fault! But he gets another - surely this time. A long rally, the Aussie has the Spaniad on the ropes, he only has to finish it with the easy smash but it ends up in the net. “A shot he would make 97 out of 100 times if it is not set point against Nadal,” the assessment of Jim Courier. A wild crosscourt forehand misses next, then the champion converts his break-back point. And after six minutes of chaos and drama we’re back on serve in the third with Nadal next up at 4-5. With Nadal needing to hold serve to stay in the set, he does so to love. And what a winner to go to 40-0, hammering down the line with that famous forehand of his, followed by an even better show to take the game, a half-volley from his toes. Quite superb, the old boy. Over to Popyrin, who will serve to take the third! Popyrin holds and holds easily. He’s serving beautifully. Popyrin breaks! Yes, you’re reading that correctly: Nadal has dropped his serve at Roland Garros. The Australian earned himself two bites of the cherry and got there from 30-40 with Nadal missing by a long way out wide. The chat 20 minutes ago was about how many consolation games the Australian could salvage in this set. Now, if he can hold his serve twice more, he’ll snaffle a set! Fantastic from Popyrin, holding to love with some huge first serves. This set remains on serve (3-2), but the younger of the men has earned himself a chance to pinch it... but he has to break right now. Oh, and another seed has fallen this afternoon. Fair play to the young man, he’s not going to acquiesce. This turns into his most competitive non-service game since the early stages of the opening set, twice getting Nadal to deuce. The experience ultimately shone through, the champ coming out on top of the break point rallies to take the game, but this is entertaining tennis. A pair of aces wins Popyrin a second service game. Bang, bang. A good experience for the 21-year-old against Nadal on his court. Interesting chat about Nadal’s longevity. Jim Courier, citing Carlos Moya (his coach), says that the way to stay in the game longer involves him playing more aggressively in his twilight years to help protect his body early in tournaments. Stands to reason. And it’s what he does here, by the way, holding to love. It’s 1-1 in the third. In the commentary box, they are trying to guess how many further games Popyrin will win - two or three. There’s not even a consideration that he could pinch a set, such is the dominance of Nadal in situations like this. He does hold here though - nicely done. Another seed hits the deck on day two with Ricardas Berankis from Lithuania bouncing Frenchman Ugo Humbert (29) in four sets. We also got a look at Venus Williams during the break, the 40-year-old losing the first set 6-3 to Russian 32-seed Ekaternia Alexandrova. Just 1000 spectators are permitted inside Centre Court, the TV tells me, and what a joy it is watching Nadal work an opponent over close up. Despite some impressive winners from the Australian over the last two games, he’s won the second set in a canter, now up 6-3, 6-2. Popyrin is going down swinging. He might lose the set (he will lose the set) but some of those forehands thundered past Nadal, holding serve to love. “That was some awesome tennis,” says Jim Courier. Too easy. Nadal out wide with an ace to seal his easiest service game of the match so far. Popyrin serving at 1-5 to stay in the set. Some respite for Popyrin, Nadal taking his foot off the pedal for long enough to let the Australian win a game for the first time in half an hour or longer. Still well behind, but he needed to stop the rot. Nadal holds. He’s in cruise control with Popyrin overwhelmed. The TV broadcast promotes Djokovic v Sandgren coming up during the night session - what I’d give to hear their locker room bantz. Delightful from Nadal, looping the forehand winner around the net on the stretch. “He calls that the banana!” roars Jim Courier. It’s the catalyst for a brain explosion from Popyrin, attempting a low percentage drop shot from beyond the baseline, giving the Spaniad three further break points, the third converted. Nadal to serve at 3-0. Ever so close for Popyrin. He got Nadal to deuce, then won a break point but missed the forehand winner down the line. In the long rally that followed, the younger man was worked over before the champ busted out a tidy serve-and-volley to hold. He leads 6-3, 2-0. Here comes Rafa. Breaks Popyrin, holds, wins the set, breaks him again to begin the second - to 15, no less. This could get ugly. An upset on court 14 with the number seven seed in the men’s draw knocked off in five sets by German veteran Jan-Lennard Struff. Nadal wins the first 6-3, the first job complete in 39 minutes. As it it were foretold after breaking Popyrin, the left-hander went boom, boom, boom to earn three set points, converting the second. Nadal earns a break point and goes after it on the return, forcing Popyrin into a forehand that sprays off the top of his racquet. He’ll serve for the set. Meanwhile, I miss Paris in June. Don’t we all? “Taking one set off him is an achievement,” Jim Courier says of Nadal, noting he’s only lost 27 sets in 102 matches at Roland Garros. Wild. He’s through this service game without any fuss, leading 4-3. Popyrin has already nailed four aces. The 21-year-old holds to love. “Hello Adam.” Hello, Andrew Benton. “It’s a pity it has come to this for Naomi Osaka - I saw that the WTA provides supports to players for mental health and they must surely be able to help with dealing with press conferences, which every player of any standing will have to deal with. Feels like a failure on their part. I wonder if Osaka’s US Open press conference in 2018, when Serena Williams had had a tough time on court, might have been a particularly stressful one - I seem to remember the story was more about Williams’ issues, rather than Osaka’s amazing victory.” Geoff Lemon, who has written extensively about depressive illnesses, wrote a couple of tweets about this earlier today. Nadal holds to 15 - more comfortable here. He leads 3-2 in the first. A tour-de-force from Marina Hyde on Osaka’s withdrawal. You do have to admire tennis’s position on health. The women’s No 2 has been pushed into withdrawing from a grand slam for having the temerity to take a small step to protect her own mental equilibrium, while the men’s No 1 has spent the past 14 months continually honking out anti-Covid vaccine messages . Novak Djokovic has not been officially censured for that, nor for the ridiculous super-spreader tournament he hosted across the Balkans last summer against all advice, which saw several players (including him) catch Covid. As for the hierarchy of the sport’s sins, how predictable that it should be “doing press conferences” that united all four slams in a joint condemnatory press release, while they remain utterly silent on world No 6 Alexander Zverev many months after he was accused in great detail of domestic violence and mental abuse by his ex-girlfriend. Zverev issued a denial; and denial in any case remains tennis’s comfort zone. For a major sport it is fundamentally incurious, testing for performance enhancing drugs, according to a 2016 investigation, at the same levels as kayaking or handball. Big backhand, some tidy serve and volley.... nice work, young man. Nadal responds by turning the pressure up and getting to deuce, but Popyrin holds with an ace down the middle and an outstanding crosscourt forehand winner. 2-2 in the first. Entertaining so far. From a couple of points to deuce. Two good non-service games for Popyrin, more than keeping Nadal honest in these early exchanges. Popyrin has a giant serve. We saw that at the Aussie Open in 2019 when he knocked off Dominic Thiem in the third round in front of a massive Saturday TV local TV audience. Two aces; nice start. 1-1. Nadal holds, but Popyrin wins a couple of points. Good for nerves. Nadal v Popyrin. The champion to serve. Go! He does it! WHAT A RESPONSE FROM THE CROWD! Beautiful! Nadal is ready to roll on centre court, but we’ll stick with Monfils. I remember fondly his arrival in Melbourne in 2007 and what excitement he brought with those crazy-brave crosscourt forehands. It was tough to watch him play in February at the same tournament, brought to tears after capitulating in the opening round. Come on! STIRRING STUFF from Gael Monfils! The Paris crowd go WILD for their man as he breaks Ramos-Vinolas, the catalyst one of those sliding forehands we’ve known and loved from the Frenchman over the last 15 years. He’ll now go on to serve for the match. This means so much to Monfils. He’s been so badly out of sorts, not winning a match on tour this year, and the crowd have his back. He repays the faith with a scorching winner - classic Monfils - then wins an error to hold serve. Go you good thing. It’s 4-4 in the fourth. On court 14, Andrey Rublev, the seventh seed from Russia, has pulled level with journeyman Jan-Lennard Struff at two sets each. Back to Monfils v Ramos-Vinolas. It’s the fourth set with the Frenchman serving at 3-4. Well, he was about to after this time out - Monfils is, according to the broadcast, is asking for some salt. He adds to that by pouring a bottle of water over his head. Same, same. Up next on Court Suzanne Philippe-Chatrier... it’s the greatest to ever roam the Parisian surface, the 13-time winner, Rafael Nadal. He’s up against Australian Alexei Popyrin, who has a bit about him. ITV’s main advertiser is using one of the best tracks of the 1980s, which means we get to hear the chorus every ten minutes. You’re welcome. Barty speaks. “This court is very close to my heart. It’s so nice to play here in front of fans, you make it enjoyable for players. Thank you very much.” She is asked about her decision to go on the road during the Covid and stands by it, speaking with family every day. It wasn’t always pretty, but Barty is through. Pera was broken once again to finish, not helped by the No1’s massive backhand return. But she done well, definitely looks like a player on the rise. Barty can see the finish line. Pera, who has done so little wrong until the last five minutes, miscues her forehand again, which is all the number one seed requires to press the advantage. A wild backhand error finishes the game, Pera now serving to stay in the match at 2-5. Barty breaks! Pera’s serve has been in good shape but the 2019 winner hung in there and opened up an opportunity of her own, the American whack a rudimentary forehand into the net. It’s 4-2. Barty is building, holding to love. A handy time for an easy game, built on the back of a fantastic rally at 15-0, followed in with her fourth ace of the match. Big game experience helps her here. It’s 2-2 in the third. Pera bangs a forehand winner down the line, holding from 40-30. Back to you, Ash Barty. A tough hold for Barty, getting through two break points. On both occasions, she was saved by her big serve. Between times, Pera continues to create opportunities with her dynamic backhand, beating the Australan down the line with a beauty. Meanwhile, on Court Suzanne-Lenglen, Monfils has won the the third set 6-4. “Not saying in any way that Barty’s problem wasn’t genuine,” I’m tweeted, “but perhaps they should abolish the medical time out and replace it with a five minute break between sets, which is then fair to both players.” I don’t mind the status quo. All part of the theatre. A game apiece in the third on Court Philippe-Chartier, both Barty and Pera holding from 40-30. On Barty’s injury, it was her left glute being worked on, strapping now visible down her thigh. Boris Becker has weighed in with Osaka, this report via Reuters. “I heard her first response a couple of days ago about this media boycott and that is something to be always taken seriously, especially from such a young woman,” Becker told Eurosport for whom he works as an analyst. “She couldn’t cope with the pressures of facing the media after she loses a match, but that happens frequently and you have to deal with it. “If she can’t cope with the media in Paris, she can’t cope with the media in Wimbledon or the U.S. Open. So I almost feel like her career is in danger due to mental health issues.” That doesn’t strike me as particularly helpful commentary from Boom Boom. On this, Jonathan Liew’s piece is worth a read. Monfils holds; he’s up 5-3 in the third. Barty is back on her feet too, serving in the first game of the third and deciding set. Ash Barty has taken an injury time out. They are working on the top of her thigh between sets. Testing times for the top seed. Around the courts, Gael Monfils, the 14th seed, has pulled level at one set apiece after dropping the first to Albert Ramos-Vinolas. The Frenchman was gutted after losing on the opening day at Melbourne Park - he’ll be desperate to clear that bar at his home Grand Slam. Indeed, he now has a break in the third, serving at 4-3. Going well. Bernarda Pera wins the second set 6-3! Barty is going to have to do it the hard way with the 70th ranked player in the world holding her nerve when it mattered most. She had to get through a break point after missing a backhand volley, but repsonded with a couple of big serves before closing out the set. They’re one set all. Barty holds after giving Pera a set point when swinging wildly at 30-all. The Australian responds with a pair of forehand winners - crosscourt with power then a classy topspin effort - to shift the game back in her favour. Over to Pera, serving for the second set. Afternoon, all. Barty away well in the first, under pressure now. Reminds me of how she was bundled out of the Australian Open January. I was there at the time and, needless to say, it didn’t go over well with the locals. She gets a look at a 15-30 here but her floating forehand is long. Pera responds with a crunching down-the-line winner at 30-all then holds. Barty will serve to stay in the set at 2-5. Ok, time now to hand over to the excellent Adam Collins for the afternoon’s play. À bientôt. Barty not having it so easy, with Pera 4-1 up in the second set, and her second serve not doing its job. She’s back at 2-4 now but needs to find a way through her opponent’s serve. Struff and Rublev is really turning into quite the slugfest, with each man threatening the other’s serve. But no break as yet in the third set, with the Russian in peril. Cheers can be heard across Roland Garros as Monfils takes a second set tie-break 8-6 against Albert Ramos Viñolas to level the sets at 1-1. Some recovery after losing the first 6-1. Barty has taken the first set against Pera 6-4, and has found her groove after those attritional first few games. Rublev, with some vocal support from some Russian-sounding rowdies in the crowd, turns around the tie-break to go 4-3 up. Then it goes to 4-4. Then 5-5, it’s a very tight match. Struff serves a very timely ace and he has set point. Rublev saves that with an ace of his own. Then Rublev rages as his volley gives Struff chance to claim another set point. And Struff booms a wonderful serve to lead the seventh seed 2-0. Rublev v Struff has gone to a tie-break in the second set, with Struff already a set up. And here’s Tumaini Carayol on the Osaka question. Simon Baker, the four-time Olympian walker for Australia, has got in touch on the subject of Naomi Osaka: “Workplace bullying is alive and well in tennis world. Treatment of Ms Osaka highlights hypocrisy of sports run by old male pale bean counters.” And Barty gets the break again, she’s 3-2 up on Pera. Meanwhile, Gaël Monfils, the local lad, is in a bit of trouble, losing the first set 6-1 to Albert Ramos Viñolas. It’s 4-4 in the second set. It’s 2-2 between Barty and Pera. They seem evenly matched at present, with both breaking the other. Andrey Rublev, the seventh men’s seed is having a ding dong with Jan-Lennard Struff but is 5-2 up in the second set, Struff having won the first set 6-3. Pera serves out the first game against Barty, but with some difficulty, as it takes in several deuces. She has trouble with her first serve all game yet wins it with an ace. Ashleigh Barty is imminent on Philippe-Chatrier, taking on Bernarda Pera. Barty did not defend her 2019 title, deciding not to travel in October last year in the wake of Covid-19. The fifth seed is through in the women’s singles, nice and easy for Elina Svitolina against the qualifier, Française Océane Babel. De Minaur delivers a handy service hold to take the third set to a tie-breaker. Travaglia is going down fighting, that’s for sure. De Minaur goes 2-0 up, then it goes to 2-1, then 3-1 when Travaglia crashes into the net. Next, the Italian goes far too long for 4-1. And again for 5-1, his grip ever loosening. Next, De Minaur is sent skidding as it goes to 5-2. When it goes to 5-3 there’s a wobble in the offing. Next comes 5-4. De Minaur has two serves to go through. Then match point is reached when Travaglia wallops one long once again. Then Travaglia nets and the Australian is through. But no, Travaglia has broken back for 3-3 and it’s back with serve against De Minaur. And he serves out to love to go 4-3 up. This ain’t over. De Minaur is now 3-2 up, two sets up and a break up against Travaglia. He’s looking good for the win now. A couple more results from today’s early matches. France’s Fiona Ferro is through, having beaten Liang En-shuo. And Ons Jabeur beat Yulia Putintseva 7-5 6-2. Another result in. Per AP Australian Open runner-up Jennifer Brady breezed past Anastasija Sevastova to reach the second round and match her best performance at the French Open. The 13th-seeded American, who has never reached the third round at Roland Garros, won 6-3, 6-3 after breaking Sevastova at love in the final game. Brady is not a clay specialist. She played only one tournament on the surface last year, losing her opening match at Roland Garros. She achieved her best result on clay earlier this season when she made it to the third round in Madrid in the buildup to the French Open. De Minaur is now two sets up on Travaglia, having won the second 6-4. He’s looking good for the win. Another Australian, Astra Sharma, won in the women’s singles, having beaten Irina Bara 7-6 6-2. Colin Watts gets in touch. As somebody who regularly faces disability-discrimination (rather than mental health) I can understand her plight; particularly when LBGT and racial issues are now (hopefully) becoming socially unacceptable. Much has already been said in the excellent blog by Jonathan Liew; the intolerance shewn by to Ms Osaka in respect of her health and well being beggars belief. Indeed I would suggest the French Tennis Federation’s actions could be tantamount to bullying with the ‘excuse of player contractual obligations’ being morally repugnant. If this was (say) a disability ‘contractual obligations’ would ultimately not be accepted. PS - I note the French Tennis Federation read a prepared statement Osaka their support but declined to accept questions from the media! With a typically crushing shot, Sakkari beats Zavatska 6-4 6-1, having really stepped it up in that second set. Sakkari is cruising into the second round, having twice broken Zavatska, she is serving at 4-0 up in the second set. Carla Suárez Navarro will return to the Roland Garros court today, having been forced to retire because of Hodgkin’s lymphoma, before making her comeback. She plays Sloane Stephens this afternoon. Sakkari has taken the first set against Zavatska 6-4. Liang En-shuo and Fiona Ferro, on Court Suzanne-Lenglen, has gone to a third set, both winning their sets by 6-1. Osaka has been receiving support back in Japan. Per Reuters. “The first thing to be considered is Ms. Osaka’s health. I wish her the earliest possible recovery,” Japan Tennis Association (JTA) Executive Director Toshihisa Tsuchihashi said in a statement. Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato told a news conference that he would “watch over her quietly” and there was concern on the streets of Tokyo for the woman who will be one of the faces of this year’s Olympic Games in the city. “I think she’s under a lot of pressure, more than we can imagine,” kimono dresser Tomomi Noguchi, 67, told Reuters. She got to the top when she was young so I think we can’t really imagine what she’s going through.” Vickie Skorji, who manages a helpline at TELL, a non-profit counselling service in Japan, said society needed to be “more respectful and supportive” of mental health. “Who has asked her how she is doing? She put out a statement and said ‘I need to take care of myself,’ and she’s been punished,” Skorji said. “I think she is courageous and needs support.” And De Minaur takes that first set 6-2, nice and easy so far for him. Japan’s Yasutaka Uchiyama has taken the first set 6-3 against the Italian, Marco Cecchinato. Per Reuters, on Osaka. There was some criticism of Roland Garros organisers for their handling of the matter. French Tennis Federation President Gilles Moretton read a prepared statement on Monday offering Osaka their support but the irony of him not taking questions, given the context of the row, was not lost on some. “So the FFT handled the Ms Osaka mental health concerns without empathy or sensitivity. Then the FFT President refuses to take questions at a presser. An own goal,” wrote former Australian tennis official Richard Ings. Alex de Minaur, the Australian 21st seed, has got himself in a commanding position in the first set against Stefano Travaglia. He’s winning 5-1, and serving well. It does look tres beau. Some big names from across sport have spoken out for Osaka. Martina Navratilova: I am so sad about Naomi Osaka. I truly hope she will be ok. As athletes we are taught to take care of our body, and perhaps the mental and emotional aspect gets short shrift. This is about more than doing or not doing a press conference. Good luck Naomi - we are all pulling for you! Billie-Jean King: It’s incredibly brave that Naomi Osaka has revealed her truth about her struggle with depression. Right now, the important thing is that we give her the space and time she needs. We wish her well. NBA legend Steph Curry: You shouldn’t ever have to make a decision like this - but so damn impressive taking the high road when the powers that be don’t protect their own. Major respect. Which leaves Piers Morgan. Far more to come on Osaka throughout the day, but we begin with some low-key stuff on the courts. Katarina Zavatska has just broken Maria Sakkari, the 17th seed, but is then immediately broken back. A glance at the Eurosport coverage see Babsi Schett, Boris Becker and Mats Wilander skirt the Osaka issue in a very quick intro but it won’t be going away. Serena Williams, after winning her first round match yesterday, had this to say. Of course, the big news at Roland Garros has not yet centred on what has happened on the court. There will be fallout through the day on Naomi Osaka’s withdrawal, and the press conferences will probably revolve around what press conferences are for, and met with sidesteps as neat as anything you see on the clay. Nevertheless, the show must - and will - go on and the return of Nadal to his kingdom will perhaps cool the unfortunate circus that has formed around l’affaire Osaka. He begins his campaign for his 14th (fourteenth) title by meeting the Australian, Alexei Popyrin, on Philippe-Chatrier. Before that, the 2019 women’s champions and number one seed, Ashleigh Barty, takes on Bernarda Pera, the American-Croatian. Here’s the full order of play.","charCount":"24292","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/adam-collins\">Adam Collins</a> (now) and <a href=\"profile/john-brewin\">John Brewin</a> (earlier)"},{"headline":"Joe Root sets England target of seven straight Test wins before Ashes","standfirst":"<ul><li>England play New Zealand twice and India five times</li><li>Stuart Broad promoted to vice-captain in Ben Stokes’ absence</li></ul>","trailText":"England play New Zealand twice and India five times, and Joe Root wants his team to win all seven matches before the winter trip to Australia","byline":"Ali Martin","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0ab38b33a1bc448ca2c069c410432a054c300825\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ab38b33a1bc448ca2c069c410432a054c300825/113_0_5212_3128/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Root (right) catches in the slips during a nets session at Lord’s in preparation for Wednesday’s first test against New Zealand.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Root (right) catches in the slips during a nets session at Lord’s in preparation for Wednesday’s first test against New Zealand.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gareth Copley/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Joe Root has set the lofty target of securing seven successive Test victories this summer, even if the England captain concedes that planning for the winter’s Ashes assault will likely dominate thoughts in the background.<br><br>The first Test against New Zealand at Lord’s, starting on Wednesday, heralds the return of international crowds after a year-long absence, with the two-match series followed by five against India from 4 August.

The first Test against New Zealand at Lord’s, starting on Wednesday, heralds the return of international crowds after a year-long absence, with the two-match series followed by five against India from 4 August. As the two best teams in the world at present – and finalists in the World Test Championship – this dual challenge is a stiff one. However, Root, who confirmed a debut for Gloucestershire’s James Bracey behind the stumps and the appointment of Stuart Broad as vice-captain in the absence of the injured Ben Stokes, remains unapologetic about England’s priority this year being the trip to Australia in November. “There’s going to be constant conversations about Australia throughout this summer,” Root said. “There’s no getting away from that.

Economies are reopening, so the demand for oil is increasing. However, expected oil demand in 2021 is still about five million barrels per day below 2019 levels. During the Covid-19 crisis, OPEC and other major oil producing countries such as Russia absorbed the drop in demand for crude oil by significantly reducing production. This removed 10% of supply from the market.</p> <p>In recent months production has slowly resumed. There are still over nine million barrels per day of spare capacity though. We expect OPEC will opt for a cautious approach to keep the market in balance. Above all it will be afraid of flooding the market with crude oil too soon. We saw confirmation of this earlier in the year when Saudi Arabia offered to unilaterally cut production by an additional one million barrels per day. That being said, in April it decided to increase production by 2.1m barrels per day from May to July in anticipation of a pick-up in global economic growth.</p> <p>It will remain cautious however, thanks to other areas where supply could yet rebound beyond its control.

The Stoxx 600 index of leading European stocks ended 0.75% higher at 450.1 points, with the surge in factory growth last month cheering traders. With oil and commodity prices rising, Energy stocks were the top sector, followed by basic materials (including those FTSE 100 miners), industrial stocks and consumer cyclicals. Ticketing company Trainline was the top Stoxx 600 riser, up 6.6%, having slumped last month after the UK government announced it would run its own ticketing website, as part of rail reform. The Mail on Sunday reported that analysts think Trainline’s overseas arm could be a big growth driver instead. Germany’s DAX gained almost 1% today, with France’s CAC up 0.66%, amid optimism for a strong recovery this year. But....Mihir Kapadia, CEO of Sun Global Investments says investors should be cautious, given concerns about inflation (which rose above target in the eurozone today). However, there are still concerns regarding policymakers, who remain focused on tackling inflation, which could still cap gains for some time. This could be a slow process as we await further economic data but could be crucial in easing expectations and avoiding any unnecessary losses during this period.” Back in London, the FTSE 100 blue-chip index has closed nearly 58 points higher at 7080 points, up 0.8% today. That’s its highest closing level in three weeks, after it hit an intraday three-week high of 7118 points during today’s upbeat session. Miners held their place as the top risers, boosted by stronger commodity prices and hopes of higher demand thanks to the surge in factory activity last month. Anglo American, copper miner Antofagasta and Rio Tinto all gained around 4%, with advertising group WPP up 3.7% and steelmaker Evraz rising 3.3%. The jump in crude oil prices lifted BP (+2.8%) and Royal Dutch Shell (+2%), with Brent at its highest since March and US crude touching the highest since 2018 (although it’s dipped a little since). UK housebuilders also had a good day, with Barratt Development up 2.3% and Persimmon gaining 2.5%. Banking giants HSBC (-2%) and luxury goods maker Burberry (-1.3%) led the fallers, with pharmaceuticals group AstraZeneca (-1.1%), internet security firm Avast (-1%) and online grocery technology firm Ocado (-0.7%) also lower. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, says gains in stock indices have mirrored the sunny UK weather, lifted by the strong factory growth data from China, the eurozone, UK and the US. Growth sectors such as health care and tech stocks continue to struggle compared to the cyclical areas such as mining - where UK commodity prices have driven the gains for the FTSE 100, he says. Investors seem to be largely shrugging off concerns that Covid variants will continue to emerge, or that the UK’s reopening could be delayed, Beauchamp adds: “Fortunately, there is a growing realisation that developed nations must do their part to supply vaccines to others, in a move that would ultimately benefit everyone. “UK reopening plans for 21 June are in doubt thanks to the Delta variant, but for now that does not appear to be hitting risk assets in any significant way even as Scotland revises some of its plans for the lifting of restrictions.” Crunch all today’s factory PMI reports together, and you find that the global manufacturing sector expanded at a robust pace in May. Production rose at one of the fastest rates in a decade, as new order growth accelerated to an 11-year high. The outlook remained positive, with manufacturers forecasting further increases in output over the next 12 months. This pushed the JP Morgan Global Manufacturing PMI to 56.0 in May, up from 55.9 in April, its highest level in over 11 years. Solid improvements in business conditions were seen across the consumer, intermediate and investment goods sectors, with employment up...and price pressures growing as supply chains struggled. Twenty four out of the 30 nations for which May data were available registered better business conditions. Europe was a bright spot in the upturn, with the six top-ranked countries (the Netherlands, Austria, the UK, Germany, Ireland and Italy) located in that region. The US also saw a solid pace of expansion. Subdued growth was registered in Japan, China, Russia and India. The Philippines, Turkey, Thailand, Mexico, Colombia and Myanmar all saw contractions. Wall Street’s early rally is faltering a little, with the S&amp;P 500 now flat and the tech-focused Nasdaq dipping into the red (-0.2%). Transport news: Work to introduce driverless tube trains has been demanded by ministers as part of an emergency funding agreement for Transport for London, with the government injecting just over £1bn to help the capital recover from the pandemic. TfL will be obliged to produce business cases for driverless trains on the Piccadilly and Waterloo and City lines in return for the latest funding, which also comes with a requirement to make £300m of annual cuts and slash pensions. The mayor, Sadiq Khan, said the short-term settlement was a “sticking plaster” and that he had reluctantly agreed to the conditions. However, he promised to fight any further moves to introduce driverless trains, which he said would cost billions of pounds and be a “gross misuse of taxpayers’ money”. Here’s the full story: Labor shortages are now emerging as a key restraint on the US manufacturing sector, says Michael Pearce, senior US economist at Capital Economics: While the headline ISM manufacturing index edged up to 61.2 in May, from 60.7, the main takeaway from the release was that shortages of workers, and not just raw materials, now appear to be playing a key role in holding back production and pushing up prices. Production growth at US factories accelerated last month as client demand increased, two surveys have shown. But firms also reported significant supply chain disruption, backlogs of work, and problems hiring staff. IHS Markit’s US manufacturing PMI has come in at 62.1 in May, up from 60.5 in April, and above the earlier ‘flash’ estimate of 61.5. That shows rapid growth – as we’ve seen in the UK and eurozone already today. The PMI survey found that: Output expanded at faster rate as growth in new order inflows strengthens Supply chain disruption lead to soaring cost pressures Backlogs of work rose at quickest pace on record New orders increased at the fastest pace since the survey began in 2007, lifted by both domestic and foreign client demand. This upturn was often linked to the loosening of Covid-19 restrictions and successful vaccine rollouts, which led to stronger demand conditions. But cost pressures surged, leading manufacturers to lift their own prices at the fastest rate in the survey’s 14-year history. The rate of job creation slowed to the softest since December 2020, with some companies reporting problems finding suitable staff to fill vacancies. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said: US manufacturers are enjoying a bumper second quarter, with the PMI hitting a new high for the second month running in May. Inflows of new orders are surging at a rate unsurpassed in 14 years of survey history, buoyed by reviving domestic demand and record export sales as economies reopen from Covid-19 restrictions. However, elevated levels of other survey indicators are less welcome: prices charged by manufacturers are also rising at an unprecedented rate, linked to soaring input costs and unparalleled capacity constraints. Not only is operating capacity being curbed by record supply chain delays so far in the second quarter, but firms have also been increasingly unable to hire sufficient staff. Hence backlogs of work are building up at an unprecedented rate, as firms struggle to meet demand. The Institute of Supply Management’s manufacturing PMI survey tells a very similar picture. It jumped to 61.2 in May, from April’s 60.7 - again showing rapid growth, but with work backlogs rising and firms struggling to find staff. The key points are: New Orders, Production &amp; Employment Growing; Supplier Deliveries Slowing at Faster Rate; Backlog Growing (continuing at a record high) Raw Materials Inventories Growing; Customers’ Inventories Too Low (at an all-time low) Prices Increasing; Exports and Imports Growing ISM’s Employment Index expanded for the sixth straight month, but panelists continue to note significant difficulties in attracting and retaining staff, at their own companies and at suppliers. In New York, stocks have begun June on the front foot. The main indices are all higher as trading resumes after yesterday’s Memorial Day holiday, pushing the S&amp;P 500 index near to record levels. Dow: up 150 points or 0.44% at 34,680 S&amp;P 500: up 15 points or 0.35% at 4,219 Nasdaq Composite: up 53 points or 0.4% at 13,802 Oil stocks are sharply higher, following the jump in crude prices today. Devon Energy (+12.2%) and Marathon Oil (+11%) are leading the S&amp;P 500 risers. On the Dow, the oil producer Chevron (+2.8%) is the top riser, followed by the aerospace manufacturer Boeing (2.8%), the investment bank Goldman Sachs (+1.6%) the and financial services firm American Express (+1.6%). Corrections corner: I mangled Olaf van den Heuvel’s job title in the Brent crude oil entry earlier. To clarify, he’s CIO Aegon AM NL. Now fixed. Apologies. The jump in crude oil is likely to mean higher energy and transport bills for consumers and businesses, putting upward pressure on inflation. But the good news today, for small firms and organisations, is that they shouldn’t be ripped off by unscrupulous energy brokers. Ofgem, the energy regulator, is forcing brokers to reveal their hidden commission fees, to protect more than a million microbusinesses from being overcharged. My colleague Jillian Ambrose explains: All energy brokers will need to disclose how much commission they stand to earn from their services after some rogue brokers conned charities, church groups and care homes by locking them into long-term bad-value gas and electricity contracts. Ofgem hopes to root out these “poor practices” by forcing brokers to disclose their full commission fees upfront, and by offering microbusiness customers a 14-day cooling-off period after signing a new energy deal. The regulator is setting out the measures almost 18 months after it was made aware that some energy brokers may have overcharged ultra-small companies by up to £2bn by hiding their commission fees. Canada’s economy grew slower than expected in the first quarter of this year, and appears to have contracted in April. Canadian GDP increased by 1.4% during the January-March period, new data shows, down from the 2.2% growth seen in October-December 2020 The economy picked up in March, growing 1.1% after 0.4% growth in February, but is still around 1% smaller than before the pandemic. Statistics Canada says March’s expansion was the 11th consecutive monthly increase, after the steepest drops in Canadian economic activity on record in March and April 2020. But it also estimates that GDP fell in April, by around 0.8%, due to restrictions introduced to restrict the Covid-19 virus. Declines in retail trade and accommodation and food services reflect in part additional public health measures in some parts of the country. There are also notable declines in manufacturing, real estate and rental and leasing, and educational services. US crude price are rallying too, hitting their highest levels since October 2018. Predictions that the oil market is tightening this summer are driving crude prices up, Bloomberg says: US crude futures climbed to the highest in more than two-and-a-half years after the OPEC+ alliance forecast a tightening global market, while international efforts to revive a nuclear deal with Iran were yet to reach a breakthrough. West Texas Intermediate rose as much as 3.2% from Friday’s close to $68.42 a barrel, while global benchmark Brent topped $70, a level it has failed to hold for a sustained period since 2019. The oil glut built up during the coronavirus pandemic has almost gone and stockpiles will slide rapidly in the second half of the year, according to an assessment of the market from an OPEC+ committee. A ministerial group is gathering in Vienna, before a full meeting that is expected to ratify a scheduled output increase for July. Brent crude has hit its highest level in almost three months, as oil ministers from Opec countries and their allies prepare to decide whether to lift production. Brent is up over 2% today, hitting $71 per barrel for the first time since early March. The Opec+ group, led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, are expected to stick to their plan of gradually relaxing supply curbs, as they await to see whether Iran’s production increases (if a nuclear deal with the US is agreed). Factory data from China earlier today, showing the fastest growth this year, is also positive for oil demand, as are the record manufacturing PMI readings from the eurozone and UK this morning. Olaf van den Heuvel, CIO at Aegon AM NL, expects OPEC will attempt to stabilise oil prices as spare capacity responds to rising demand, rather than boost supply too fast and risk another price war. Commodity prices are in the spotlight because of rising inflation. Economies are reopening, so the demand for oil is increasing. However, expected oil demand in 2021 is still about five million barrels per day below 2019 levels. During the Covid-19 crisis, OPEC and other major oil producing countries such as Russia absorbed the drop in demand for crude oil by significantly reducing production. This removed 10% of supply from the market. In recent months production has slowly resumed. There are still over nine million barrels per day of spare capacity though. We expect OPEC will opt for a cautious approach to keep the market in balance. Above all it will be afraid of flooding the market with crude oil too soon. We saw confirmation of this earlier in the year when Saudi Arabia offered to unilaterally cut production by an additional one million barrels per day. That being said, in April it decided to increase production by 2.1m barrels per day from May to July in anticipation of a pick-up in global economic growth. It will remain cautious however, thanks to other areas where supply could yet rebound beyond its control. This includes Iran, which is currently producing two million barrels of oil per day but could reach toward 6.5m if a new nuclear deal is agreed with the US. The US itself could also up its capacity as prices rise and shale oil producers come back into play. OPEC will be wary of restarting a price war with those producers that ended so badly for them in 2014 and 2015. The pound has now dropped back from its three-year high against the US dollar. Having hit $1.4250 early this morning, sterling has now dipped to $1.4175, down a third of a cent. Reuters attributes this dip to profit-taking, and some concerns that the UK’s reopening plans could be disrupted by the latest Covid-19 strain, now known as the Delta variant. We saw some profit taking appear this morning as the market looked to monetise the gains made overnight,” said Stuart Cole, head macro economist at Equiti Capital. Cole added that fears that a Covid variant, first found in India, could delay the next phase of the reopening on June 21 also capped sterling’s gains. Inflation fears kept the overnight optimism in check after Bank of England Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden said the central bank is carefully monitoring Britain’s booming housing market. The government’s former chief scientific adviser, Prof Sir Mark Walport, warned today that the UK is facing a “quite perilous moment” as the Delta coronavirus variant becomes more dominant, accounting for three-quarters of cases. Back in UK manufacturing, the firm behind Jammie Dodgers, Wagon Wheels and Maryland Cookies has been sold. Burton’s Biscuits is being acquired by the Ferrero Group (whose Ferrero Rocher adverts at the ambassador’s reception are still fondly remembered here). Burton’s employs around 2,000 people at six production facilities at Blackpool, Dorset, Edinburgh, Livingston, Llantarnam and Isle of Arran, and dates back to 1935. Headquartered in St Albans, is being sold by the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board after eight years. Ferrero, which also makes Nutella and Kinder chocolates, says the deal will expand its sweet biscuits offering, having previously acquired Biscuits Delacre, Kelsen Group and Fox’s. Nick Jansa, senior managing director at Ontario Teachers’, says Burton’s is ‘well positioned’ for success: We’re proud to have supported Burton’s and overseen the significant growth of this leading UK biscuit manufacturer. Since our investment, Burton’s has implemented key organic growth initiatives and completed a number of strategic acquisitions to further strengthen its portfolio and manufacturing capability. Eurozone inflation is now (just) above target for the first time since October 2018. Charles Hepworth, investment director at GAM Investments, says the European Central Bank should welcome this move (it’s been trying stimulate prices and ward of deflation). Consumers probably won’t share this feeling, but Hepworth doesn’t think higher inflation will be permanent. The resurgent demand coming about from partial reopening of the bloc’s economy highlights the ongoing supply constraints in some parts of the economy. The ECB however will be more than pleased that inflation is at its implied target level, although how long it persists is open to huge debate, as witnessed in volatility seen across markets since the spectre of higher inflation emerged this year. Higher input costs will inevitably lead to a modest inflation overshoot in the short term but the continuation of monetary largesse, which doesn’t seem to be looking to be withdrawn any time soon, is arguably the deciding factor on the medium-term inflation rate. We see higher inflation as being a transient one-off supply led issue and not something that should spook investors in the medium term. Inflation across the eurozone has accelerated above the European Central Bank’s target, as rising prices hit consumers. The annual eurozone consumer prices index rose by 2% in May, flash data shows, up from 1.6% in April. Energy prices were the biggest factor, surging by 13.1% over the last year (as crude prices recover from their slump early in the pandemic). Service sector firms also raised their prices, with annual services inflation rising to 1.1% from 0.9% in April, while non-energy industrial goods rose 0.7% and food, alcohol &amp; tobacco were 0.6% higher than a year ago. This takes inflation above the ECB’s inflation target of ‘close to, but below 2%’, and could intensify pressure from more hawkish policymakers to slow its pandemic bond-buying stimulus programme. Eurostat has also reported that unemployment across the eurozone fell in April, to 8.0% from 8.1% in March. However, that’s still higher than a year ago (it was 7.3% in April 2020), due to the heavy job losses caused by Covid-19. That shows that the economic damage of the pandemic has yet to heal (especially with the eurozone falling into recession last quarter). It adds: Eurostat estimates that 15.380 million men and women in the EU, of whom 13.030 million in the euro area, were unemployed in April 2021. Compared with March 2021, the number of persons unemployed decreased by 165 000 in the EU and by 134 000 in the euro area. Compared with April 2020, unemployment rose by 1.406 million in the EU and by 1.275 million in the euro area. UK factories might growing even faster if they weren’t constrained by supply chain problems, says Mike Thornton, partner and head of manufacturing at accountancy giant RSM. He says supply shortages are now biting, as firms consume stocks built up ahead of the Brexit deadline at the end of 2020. It’s great to see another increase in the latest CIPS Manufacturing PMI to a record high of 65.6 from 60.9; and reinforces the important role that UK manufacturing will play in the economic recovery this year. It also demonstrates the resilience of manufacturers in a chaotic market; but supply chain disruption is really starting to bite now. Not only is there a shortage of certain components which is stalling production, but the cost of shipping certain products or materials is through the roof. This extra expense is the last thing manufacturers need as they try to trade out of unprecedented times. Brexit stockpiling has cushioned the blow for many manufacturers at the start of the year; but as stocks dwindle and supply chain disruption remains, we could see further pressure on input costs and production – pushing prices up even further for consumers. It’s such a shame that post-Brexit and pandemic supply chain disruption could curb economic growth at a time when manufacturers are looking to maximise the opportunity of pent up consumer spend.’ The Office for National Statistics has reported that the number of companies citing Brexit as their main challenge rose at the start of the year – replacing Covid-19 as the biggest problem for the largest proportion of firms. Here’s a good snap summary of the purchasing manager survey, from EY Item Club’s Howard Archer: By surging to 65.6 in May, the UK manufacturing PMI has burst above July 1994’s previous record high of 61.0, as well as April’s reading of 60.9. It’s now signalled an improvement in the factory sector for the last 12 months, following the first lockdown in April and May 2020. A surge of new orders has helped Britain’s factory sector to post a record increase in activity last month, as the easing of lockdown restrictions boosted demand. The UK Manufacturing PMI jumped to 65.6 in May, up from 60.9 in April, and the highest since the survey began in 1992 (any reading over 50 shows growth). IHS Markit, which compiles the survey, reports that conditions in the manufacturing sector improved at an unprecedented rate in May. Output growth strengthened, and new orders rose at the quickest pace on record. Markit says: Companies linked new order growth to rising business confidence, the further re-opening of the UK economy and reduced issues relating to Covid-19. New export orders also rose at a survey-record pace in May, amid reports of stronger demand from the EU, the US and China. But while large companies saw record gains in new export work, small firms only saw a smaller rise. Employment jumped at a record pace, with manufacturers taking on staff to handle high levels of pent-up demand. Supply disruption was a growing problem too, with companies reporting shortages of electronics, plastics and metals, transport delays and higher demand for raw materials. This drove up input costs at a record pace, leading to an unprecedented rise in output prices too, in a further sign that inflationary pressures are building. Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, said UK factories benefited from the easing of lockdown restrictions, as vaccine rollouts help economies unlock. But he also warns that consumers will see higher prices, as the jump in input costs is passed on. The UK PMI surged to an unprecedented high in May, as record growth of new orders and employment supported one of the steepest increases in production volumes in the near 30-year survey history. Growth is being boosted by the unlocking of economies from Covid restrictions and ongoing vaccination programs. This is being felt across the globe, as highlighted by a record rise in new export business during the latest survey month. The corollaries of this strong upsurge in industrial activity are increased strain on supply chains and a build-up of price pressures. Supplies of inputs into manufacturers and finished goods on to clients are both being severely disrupted by raw material shortages, port issues, Covid restrictions, post-Brexit difficulties and market forces as demand outstrips supply. Suppliers’ delivery times subsequently lengthened to one of the greatest extents on record, while input costs and selling prices both rose at unprecedented rates. With little sign of supply pressures receding, these price rises will become more visible to consumers. Back on the housing market boom ... the Resolution Foundation flags up that prices are rising fastest in the less populated parts of the UK, confirming that the ‘race for space’ is happening. Resolution’s research, released last month, found that house prices in the least-densely populated areas of the UK have risen almost twice as much as those in the most-densely populated areas over the past year. Demand for rural properties, or those with a garden, have jumped during the lockdown and the move to more home working. Domino’s Pizza is aiming to hire 5,000 chefs and delivery drivers, as consumers’ appetite for takeaways remains strong, at a time when the hospitality industry is battling staff shortages. Britain’s biggest pizza delivery chain said it had recruited just over 8,000 people in 2020 to meet demand, including hairdressers, taxi drivers and event managers who were not able to work as usual during lockdown. However, as Covid restrictions ease, some of Domino’s pandemic recruits are returning to their previous roles. As a result, the chain needs more staff for its 1,100 UK branches, most of which are run by franchisees. The firm has previously announced plans to open a further 200 outlets. Domino’s search for new employees comes amid warnings from the hospitality industry that it is facing a staffing crisis, with businesses trying to fill thousands of vacancies. Domino’s was “overwhelmed by the response from people of all walks of life” during last year’s recruitment drive, said Nicola Frampton, operations director at Domino’s UK. Frampton added. I’m proud we were able to play a part by offering people the opportunity to continue working and earning when times were tough. But as people start to reunite, customer demand is showing no signs of slowing and so we’re now looking for 5,000 new recruits. Here’s the full story: The UK sub-prime lender Amigo is facing insolvency after the high court rejected a controversial rescue plan last week. Amigo told the City this morning that it will not appeal against the court’s ruling, which concluded that its proposal to cut compensation payouts to customers for mis-selling loans was unfair. Amigo added that its board are considering all options, including insolvency, saying: The Board of Amigo continues to consider all options, which includes insolvency, and whether it might be possible and appropriate, given the cost of a scheme, to promote another scheme of arrangement to avoid insolvency. The UK’s financial watchdog, the FCA, opposed the original scheme of arrangement proposed by Amigo, which charges 49.9% interest and requires borrowers to provide a friend or family member to act as a guarantor for a loan. Under the plan, the compensation pool for those missold loans was capped while directors could earn £7m in long-term bonuses. Gary Jennison, chief executive officer of Amigo, said today: Without a scheme, Amigo faces insolvency as it will be unable to satisfy its customer compensation claims as well as meeting the legally binding funding obligations owed to its secured creditors. The Board is committed to finding the best solution it can for Amigo’s customers and other stakeholders and will be working with its stakeholders, including the FCA, to achieve that solution as quickly as it can. Amigo shares are down 8% this morning at around 7.6p, near to its record lows, having halved last week after the court ruling. It floated on the stock market in 2018 at 275p... The FTSE 100 index has jumped 1% this morning, amid hopes of a strong recovery from the pandemic. The blue-chip FTSE 100 index is currently up 75 points to 7,097, near to the pandemic highs hit last month, with almost every stock gaining ground. Mining companies are leading the risers, with iron ore jumping today amid reports that China could be relaxing recent restrictions on steelmakers in its Tangshan region. The weaker dollar is also pushing up commodity prices, boosting Anglo American (+4.5%), Rio Tinto (+4%), Glencore (+3.4%) and BHP Group (+3.4%). Housebuilders such as Persimmon (+2.4%), Barratt Development (+1.7%) and Taylor Wimpey (+1.2%) are also rallying, after Nationwide reported that house prices jumped sharply again in May. AJ Bell financial analyst Danni Hewson says: Robust figures from the housing market lifted the housebuilding sector while miners were in demand as commodity prices resumed an upwards trajectory. The FTSE’s rise was all the more impressive when you consider it came against the backdrop of a recovery-inspired rally in sterling. A strong pound dulls the relative worth of the overseas earnings which dominate the index. Europe’s Stoxx 600 share index has hit a new high this morning, rising by over 0.8% to 450.79 points. The eurozone manufacturing PMI has hit a new record high, as factory activity surged and inflationary pressures build up. Data firm IHS Markit has reported that its eurozone manufacturing purchasing manager’s index, which tracks activity across the sector, hit 63.1 in May, up from April’s 62.9. That’s its highest reading since the survey began in 1997 (any reading over 50 shows growth). Firms reported a slight slowdown in output and new orders, but growth rates remained near the record levels set earlier this year. There was also a record deterioration in vendor delivery times, as suppliers struggled to meet demand, which pushed up raw materials costs and forced companies to hike their own prices. Markit says: On the price front, average input costs again rose substantially, with the rate of inflation hitting an unprecedented level in line with widespread product shortages. Boosted by strong market demand, manufacturers took advantage of improved pricing power by raising their own charges at the fastest rate in more than 18 years of data availability. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, says the data suggests the eurozone will grow strongly this summer, and also see a sharp rise in inflation: Eurozone manufacturing continues to grow at a rate unprecedented in almost 24 years of survey history, the PMI breaking new records for a third month in a row. Surging output growth adds to signs that the economy is rebounding strongly in the second quarter. However, May also saw record supply delays, which are constraining output growth and leaving firms unable to meet demand to a degree not previously witnessed by the survey. In the financial markets, sterling has hit its highest level against the US dollar in three years. The pound traded as high as $1.4248 early this morning, its highest level since April 2018 (which was the highest since the 2016 EU referendum). This rally comes despite concerns about a potential third wave of Covid-19, due to rising cases of the new variant, called B.1.617.2, Bloomberg reports that traders are betting that the UK’s fast vaccine rollout will help the recovery gain traction: “The pound is favoured because the progress of vaccination puts the UK closer to economic normalisation than other countries,” said Toshiya Yamauchi, chief manager for foreign-exchange margin trading at Ueda Harlow, in Tokyo. Sterling could climb toward $1.45. Economic optimism has also lifted sterling recently, with consumer confidence strengthening, retail sales rising and company output picking up as lockdown restrictions were eased. Yesterday, the OECD predicted that the UK economy would expand by 7.2% this year, a strong bounceback, which would be the fastest since 1941. The dollar, though, has been pushed down by the huge US stimulus spending packages and the Federal Reserve’s pledge not to tighten monetary policy until it sees more progress on unemployment. Last week it hit a three-year low against China’s yuan, despite Beijing’s efforts to avoid its currency strengthening too quickly (which could hit export growth). The shortage of larger, more rural houses on the market is helping to push up prices strongly, says Nicky Stevenson, managing director at national estate agent group Fine &amp; Country: Many current buyers are those who delayed a move last year and would have been forgiven for thinking that competition would have cooled by now. Instead, they find themselves in an even tighter race as demand continues to outstrip supply. The buyers driving the market higher are still those looking for more space. Forever homes are still the order of the day and buyers are more than willing to do everything in their power to secure what they truly desire. There just aren’t enough of these larger properties coming on to the market in the right areas and there’s no sign this imbalance is going to resolve itself in time to suppress strong growth over the summer. But Guy Harrington, CEO of residential lender Glenhawk, predicts that the pace of growth will slow, especially if a third wave of Covid-19 cases hits the UK. The disconnect between the UK housing market and economic reality appears as great as ever. Government stimulus has created a false sense of consumer confidence. Iain McKenzie, CEO of The Guild of Property Professionals, says there’s a ‘frenzy’ in the housing market, with some buyers bolstered by lockdown savings: At a time when much of the country seems to be enjoying a sense of normality once again, we would expect the property market to follow suit. Today’s figures show that the market didn’t get the memo. The frenzy to snap up a property at the tail end of a pandemic is showing no signs of stopping, with double-digit growth in house prices throughout May – the highest we have seen in the best part of a decade. The success of the stamp duty holiday has certainly played its part, as well as the savings many have made while working from home. With a record-breaking new average house price, which has grown almost £24,000 over the past 12 months, it’s worth thinking about how your potential savings might not outweigh the inflated price of your new home. It is still crucial that prospective buyers go into the process with a sound understanding of the market and what they want from a new property. As demand in the market increases, the extra competition creates a fear of missing out that can distract buyers from the fundamentals. It’s important not to let the current property frenzy draw attention away from what you are really looking for. Nationwide also predicts that house prices could “accelerate further” in the coming months. The ‘race for space’, record low interest rates, and the stamp duty holiday (which will fall from £500,000 to £250,000 at the end of June, and finish three months later) could all drive activity, making it even harder for first-time buyers to get onto the housing ladder. But the market could then slow, if the end of the furlough scheme pushed up unemployment. Chief economist Robert Gardner explains: “Housing market activity is likely to remain fairly buoyant over the next six months as a result of the stamp duty extension and additional support for the labour market included in the Budget, especially given continued low borrowing costs, improving credit availability and with many people still motivated to move as a result of changing housing preferences in the wake of the pandemic. “With the stock of homes on the market constrained, there is scope for annual house price growth to accelerate further in the coming months, especially given the low base for comparison in early summer last year. Further ahead, the outlook for the market is far more uncertain. If unemployment rises sharply towards the end of the year as most analysts expect, there is scope for activity to slow, perhaps sharply, though even this could potentially be offset by ongoing shifts in housing preferences, if current trends are maintained. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The UK housing boom continues to run, with house price inflation accelerating again as the pandemic spurs people to move to larger properties in more rural areas. Figures released by Nationwide this morning show that annual house price growth jumped to 10.9% in May, up from 7.1%/year in April, pushing the new average price to a new peak. It says: Annual house price growth rises to 10.9%, the highest level in nearly seven years Prices up 1.8% month-on-month, following a 2.3% rise in April New record average price of £242,832, up £23,930 over the past twelve months Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist, says the housing market has seen a “complete turnaround over the past twelve months” since the first lockdown temporarily froze the market, with transactions reaching a record high of 183,000 in March: Gardner adds that Nationwide’s research shows that pressure for more space, or a garden, is the primary factor driving the market this spring. “Amongst homeowners surveyed at the end of April that were either moving home or considering a move, more than two thirds (68%) said this would have been the case even if the stamp duty holiday had not been extended. It is shifting housing preferences which is continuing to drive activity, with people reassessing their needs in the wake of the pandemic. Nationwide says the ‘race for space’ continues to drive demand. Of those moving or considering a move, around a third (33%) were looking to move to a different area, while nearly 30% were doing so to access a garden or outdoor space more easily, according to an online survey of consumers. Gardner adds: “Over a third (36%) of those surveyed said they were more likely to consider enhancing their home as a result of Covid19, with nearly half (46%) of these looking to add or maximise space. Faster broadband was another factor, with the move to home working and home schooling during lockdown showing the value of a good web connection. Nationwide’s results will interest the Bank of England, which is carefully monitoring Britain’s booming housing market as it weighs up the possibility that a rapid recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic will lead to a sustained period of inflation. In an interview with the Guardian today, deputy governor Sir Dave Ramsden said the Bank expected price pressures to be temporary but he and his colleagues on Threadneedle Street’s monetary policy committee were aware of the risks. Ramsden, the deputy governor responsible for markets and banking, said: “There is a risk that demand gets ahead of supply and that will lead to a more generalised pick-up in inflationary pressure. That’s something we are absolutely going to guard against. We are looking carefully at the housing market and a raft of real-term indicators.” Also coming up today Surveys of factory purchasing managers in the eurozone, UK and US are expected to show strong growth last month, and squeezed supply chains pushing up prices. Oil ministers from the Opec+ group will hold a video call today to assess the latest developments in the global markets. They’re expected to stick to the existing pace of gradually easing oil supply curbs, as demand picks up -- which has already pushed UK petrol prices up for six months in a row. Crude prices have risen overnight, with Brent crude rising over $70 per barrel.

The website, called Judge for Yourselves, claims that the family and the company it owns, Connecticut-based Purdue Pharma, are victims of a smear campaign by lawyers seeking to profit from a “strategically invented false narrative” that the firm’s high strength prescription painkiller, OxyContin, drove an epidemic that has ultimately claimed more than 500,000 lives over the past two decades. It says the Sackler family regrets that the drug “unexpectedly became part of the opioid crisis” but that those members who ran Purdue “acted lawfully and ethically”. However, the site does not address Purdue’s guilty pleas to federal crimes on two occasions, in 2007 and last year, over its huge marketing push to sell OxyContin to the masses, which included false claims that the drug was less addictive than other narcotic painkillers. Neither does it explain why the family is prepared to hand over a part of its fortune if it believes it did nothing wrong. The publicity campaign by the branch of the family descended from Raymond Sackler, one of two brothers who owned Purdue Pharma when the company entered the opioid painkiller market, comes amid accusations that it is misusing bankruptcy proceedings to keep hold of some of the billions of dollars the family made from OxyContin. Last week a judge approved a plan for the two branches of the Sackler family who have made their multi-billion-dollar fortune from OxyContin to pay $4.5 billion to settle more than 3,000 civil lawsuits. The plan would also turn Purdue Pharma into a non-profit company. But, in a highly unusual move, the deal would shield the Sacklers from further lawsuits, although not criminal prosecutions, and allow them to keep billions of dollars in profits from opioids even though the family itself has not sought bankruptcy. The publicity drive also follows publication of a damning biography of the family, Empire of Pain by the New Yorker writer, Patrick Radden Keefe . The Sacklers said the website is intended to counter “the many false allegations” by lawyers seeking to “vilify Purdue and the Sackler family”. At the core of the denial is a selective use of statistics to assert that OxyContin never accounted for more than 4% of prescription opioid sales in the US and therefore could not have been a cause of the epidemic. Analysts have called the claim “a legal and a public relations strategy” that cherry picked data on the sales of individual pills without taking account of the impact of their high narcotic content or their leading role in creating addiction. When the amount of opioid in the drugs is taken into account, OxyContin accounted for about 20% of the market. The Sacklers claims are at odds with a wide body of studies into the roots of the epidemic. In 2017, Donald Trump’s presidential Commission on Combatting Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis said Purdue’s “aggressive promotion” of OxyContin, and its broader impact on the use of opioids for pain treatment, was a leading cause of the epidemic. Two years ago, the National Bureau of Economic Research released a study of the impact of OxyContin which concluded that “the introduction and marketing of OxyContin explain a substantial share of overdose deaths over the last two decades”. Purdue used its wealth to influence politicians and regulators, keeping open the floodgates to ever larger prescribing of opioids in the US, far beyond other developed countries, even as the evidence grew of a public health crisis in the making. The billionaire Sacklers face a struggle to restore the reputation of a family whose name is stamped on museums, art galleries and medical centres around the world thanks to their large donations from the profits of OxyContin. Raymond Sackler sat on Purdue’s board from 1990 until his death in 2017. His son, Richard Sackler, was the company’s head of marketing and ramped up sales of OxyContin while painting people who overdosed on the drug as criminals to blame for their own condition. At hearings last year, one member of Congress referred to the Sacklers who own Purdue as the “most evil family in America”, after Kathe Sackler, a powerful former member of Purdue’s board, drew scorn when she said that while “my heart breaks for the parents who have lost their children”, the company was not at fault. “There’s nothing that I can find that I would have done differently,” she said.

A key quality is that they resist change: they attempt to fix for us an abiding sense of what exactly has happened. They can be many things: columns, tombs, plaques, cenotaphs, village halls, even housing. But who are they for? The people who suffered, their families, the wider public or future generations?</p> <p>At some point, inevitably, there will be an official, national memorial of the pandemic in the UK (as well as many more, surely, at local and international levels). What, then, should it look like? It will have to contend with how messy the past year has been – the death, the sorrow, the fear, but also the ensuing political and social division. Perhaps through all of that, memorialisation can play a therapeutic role.</p> <p>Memorials naturally remove some of the complexity of the past, replacing it with something smoother, better suited to a broad audience: the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/from-the-archive-blog/2020/nov/10/the-funeral-of-the-unknown-warrior-november-920\">tomb of the Unknown Warrior</a> doesn’t address one specific loss, so it can talk of all loss. Because of this universal ambition it is vital public memorials hit the right tone – being both honest and broadly interpretable, tending to avoid friction. As a result, though, memorials can feel as if they don’t talk to you directly or seem too vague. But at a time when narratives are brutally contested, it seems unlikely that a pandemic memorial will avoid controversy, no matter how skilful the architect.</p> <p><strong>Read more here: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/01/what-should-britains-memorial-covid-pandemic-look-like\">Eddie Blake – What should Britain’s memorial to the Covid pandemic look like?</a></strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/01/what-should-britains-memorial-covid-pandemic-look-like\">What should Britain’s memorial to the Covid pandemic look like? | Eddie Blake</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60b5d8288f088d8c3178f3a9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-01T06:49:42.786Z\">7.49am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Prof Adam Finn, from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, is a second expert in the UK on the airwaves today warning against further easing of domestic restrictions on 21 June.

reported 127 new coronavirus deaths in hospitals on Tuesday, compared to 126 on Monday, and the number of Covid-19 patients remained on the decline, Reuters reports. The number of people in hospital with the virus fell by 508 to 16,088 and the number of people in intensive care units with Covid-19 fell by 120 to 2,825 people. Both numbers have been falling steadily for weeks. Italy reported 93 coronavirus-related deaths on Tuesday against 82 the day before, the health ministry said, while the daily tally of new infections rose to 2,483 from 1,820, Reuters reports. Italy has registered 126,221 deaths linked to COVID-19 since its outbreak emerged in February last year, the second-highest toll in Europe after Britain and the eight-highest in the world. The country has reported 4.22 million cases to date. The International Monetary Fund will provide grant financing for £25 billion of a proposed £35 billion project aimed at ramping up global vaccinations against the coronavirus, Reuters reports. IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva said at a joint news conference with the World Health Organization, the World Bank and the World Trade Organization: “We are creating a breeding ground for variants unless we act decisively to end the pandemic everywhere.” Meanwhile the World Bank announced that it has £8.5 billion in Covid-19 vaccine financing available and will have approved vaccination financing operations in over 50 countries by the end of June. The development lender’s president, David Malpass, said it was “vital that we speed up the supply chain for vaccine distribution,” including shortening the manufacturing time, approvals and allocations of doses that have already been produced. The Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, has sparked outrage after approving plans to hold South America’s answer to the European championship in his Covid-stricken country despite warnings Brazil is steaming into a potentially calamitous third wave of infections, Tom Philips reports. Full story here: Rachel Hall here taking over from Kaamil Ahmed. Do send over anything we’ve missed to rachel.hall@theguardian.com After vaccinating large sections of the population and exiting lockdowns, several countries are evaluating the health of their economies and support packages they have had in place. In Israel, where the economy has fully opened, the finance ministry announced Tuesday that it would be scaling down support for the unemployed, starting with under-28s without families, after complaints about businesses struggling to find workers. Ireland, where 385,000 people were receiving unemployment support in April, according to AFP, has announced a €4bn package to rectify the “enormous damage” caused by the pandemic. “Our core objective is to restore, and then go beyond pre-pandemic employment levels,” said Prime minister Micheal Martin. Italy’s economy grew faster in the first quarter of this year than previously estimated, according to new data. Both Gross Domestic Product and unemployment grew 0.1 percent compared to the previous quarter. “Italy is strong, alive and is yearning to restart. The pandemic months have been very tough, for workers and businesses,” Prime Minister Mario Draghi said during a visit in the northern Emilia Romagna region. “But thanks to sacrifices made by Italians and the strong acceleration of the vaccination campaign, we are facing a new phase.” The World Health Organization has approved the Chinese Sinovac vaccine for emergency use, it said in a statement. The second Chinese vaccine against Covid-19 to be approved as safe by the WHO, it said the vaccine would be allowed to delivered under Covax, the global vaccine-sharing programme. India wants to more than triple its supply of coronavirus vaccines to 10 million per day by July as it scales up a campaign seen as keen to avoiding another outbreak as disastrous as April’s, Reuters reports. “We don’t doubt that we will be able to increase the pace of vaccinations, once supply is ramped up,” government advisor V K Paul told reporters on Tuesday. Vaccine manufacturers such as Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech are scrambling to boost supplies, with the country is also in talks with major foreign vaccine producers such as Pfizer Inc, officials have said. The health ministry said nearly 45 million people had been fully vaccinated - 4.7% of the country’s 950 million adult population. India administered nearly 2.8 million doses on Monday, according to data from its official vaccine portal. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has drawn criticism for a slow vaccine rollout even though India is one of the world’s biggest manufacturers of doses, including AstraZeneca’s shot. Healthcare workers in Huthi-held territory in Yemen will be given vaccinations from next week, a World Health Organization official told Reuters. Adham Abdel-Moneim, the WHO’s representative in Yemen, said 10,000 doses arrived in the capital Sanaa yesterday and were put in cold storage. The WHO will run the campaign. Human Rights Watch on Tuesday accused the Huthi rebels of concealing the number of Covid-19 cases in areas it controls and blocking the delivery of vaccines, despite the country receiving 360,000 doses on 31 March. Vaccinations began almost two months ago in parts of Yemen controlled by the Saudi-backed government. Doctors marched throughout India to protest a popular guru who claimed yoga can defeat Covid-19, AFP reports. The doctors denounced and called for the arrest for Baba Ramdev, who claimed modern drugs were “stupid and failed science”. The doctors’ association at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), one of Delhi’s biggest government hospitals, called Ramdev’s comments “disgraceful”. Ramdev, a keen supporter of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, retracted his comments after an appeal by India’s health minister and the guru said he had been merely reading out other people’s WhatsApp messages. But he then caused further outcry by saying that he did not need a coronavirus vaccine because he was protected by yoga and traditional medicine, or Ayurveda. Moderna has followed Pfizer by filing for full approval of its coronavirus vaccine in the US, which is currently authorised for emergency use, Reuters reports. The company said it will be submitting data to the US Food and Drug Administration over coming weeks as it seeks priority approval for the vaccine. Scarce supplies of coronavirus vaccines are endangering refugees in Asia as their host countries experience surges in Covid-19 cases, the UN’s refugee agency, UNHCR, has warned. It urged manufacturers and countries with surplus vaccines to give more vaccines to Covax. Low supplies to the global vaccine-sharing initiative has meant delayed deliveries to countries relying on it. “These countries host the vast majority of more than 80 million forcibly displaced people in the world. Yet so far, they have benefited from only a fraction of the world’s Covid-19 vaccines,” UNHCR said on Tuesday. Not a single vaccine has been delivered in the Rohingya refugees camps in Bangladesh, where the total number of cases identified more than doubled in May alone. There were also increased among refugee populations in Nepal, Pakistan, Thailand, Malaysia, Iran and Indonesia, UNHCR said. Reuters are reporting that Poland will offer Covid-19 vaccinations to children aged 12-15 from 7 June. Michal Dworczyk, the minister in charge of the country’s vaccination programme, announced the move this morning. The European Commission on Friday authorized the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine for use in children as young as 12. The Italian government has allocated €50m to help treat the estimated 164,000 people suffering from serious health problems associated with ‘long Covid’. The money will be used for regular check-ups, including of the heart, lungs and kidneys, of patients until the end of 2023 as part of a strategy also aimed at allowing medics to research the long-term impact of the virus. More than a third of Italians suffering from serious symptoms of long-Covid are from Lombardy, the region hardest-hit by the pandemic. Antonio Pisani, a neurologist at the Mondino research centre, told Il Sole 24 Ore that the risk of neurological disorders is high. Among the most common symptoms he sees among patients are ongoing fatigue, dizziness and difficulty concentrating. He said there were also signs that the virus could predispose people to diseases including Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s. “I had two patients who, before March 2020, had never visited a neurologis … a month ago one was diagnosed with Parkinson’s and the other Alzheimer’s. Therefore it’s as if Covid was an accelerator for a disease that was already there but had not yet presented itself.” Delivery to the Philippines of the first batches of a promised 17m doses of AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine made in Thailand has been delayed by several weeks, a Philippine presidential adviser has said. The delay raises questions about AstraZeneca’s vaccine distribution plan in Southeast Asia, which depend on 200m doses made by Siam Bioscience, a company owned by Thailand’s king that is making vaccines for the first time. Joey Concepcion, a presidential adviser who has been coordinating vaccine procurement with the Philippine government and private sector, told Reuters that AstraZeneca had informed him delivery of the first batch of 1.3m doses would have to be pushed back from the third week of June to mid-July and also reduced to 1.17m doses. Concepcion said he was in touch daily with AstraZeneca and was told there were delays in Thai production. “It is a new plant they are running … that is how it is when you start a new plant,” he said. AstraZeneca has faced legal action in Europe over a failure to deliver supplies as promised. Yemen’s Huthi rebels, who control most of the country’s north including the capital Sanaa, have been blocking international efforts to supply Covid vaccines, Human Rights Watch said. The New York-based group accused Huthi leaders of suppressing information about both the dangers of Covid and the prevalence of the disease in territory under their control. “The deliberate decision of the Huthi authorities to keep the real number of cases of Covid-19 under wraps and their opposition to vaccines are putting Yemeni lives at risk,” said HRW’s deputy Middle East director Michael Page. “Pretending Covid-19 does not exist is not a mitigation strategy and will only lead to mass suffering. “Given the weakened healthcare system in Yemen, Huthi authorities should at least ensure transparency so that civilians living in their areas can understand the scale of the pandemic and facilitate an international vaccination plan that meets the needs on the ground.” AFP report that Yemen received 360,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine on 31 March, the first of 1.9 million doses to be delivered this year through the Covax programme for poorer countries. However, the rebels’ failure to cooperate with the World Health Organization and the Yemeni government has prevented any vaccines from reaching the north, HRW said citing a medical source with “direct knowledge of the circumstances”. As a result, vaccinations have only been occurring in the government-held south. HRW quoted Huthi officials as dismissing Covid-19 as a “conspiracy”. “America bears the primary responsibility for the Covid-19 epidemic,” it quoted rebel leader Abdul Malik al-Huthi, as saying in a televised speech last year. Heathrow airport in London has begun processing arrivals from red list countries in a dedicated terminal following concerns about them mixing with other passengers. Travellers arriving from red list nations on direct flights are being taken to Terminal 3. Russia has announced the resumption of air travel with Britain and a number of other countries – Austria, Hungary, Lebanon, Luxembourg, Croatia, Mauritius, and Morocco – which had been suspended due to coronavirus restrictions. Peru has revised its official Covid-19 death toll to 180,764, nearly triple the previous official figure of 69,342, following a government review that shows the severity of the outbreak in the country. The World Health Organisation has recommended a new set of names for the coronavirus “variants of concern”, which will be known by letters of the Greek alphabet. Alpha is the new name for UK/Kent (B.1.1.7), Beta for South Africa (B.1.351), Gamma for Brazil (P.1) and Delta for the variant first detected in India (B.1.617.2). Chinese authorities in Guangdong province have cancelled flights and locked down communities in response to what is believed to be the first community outbreak of the “Delta” or Indian variant in China. Malaysia has begun a tough nationwide lockdown to battle a worsening coronavirus outbreak. Of almost 2,800 deaths from Covid-19 recorded in the country of 32 million since the start of the pandemic, over 40 percent were in May alone. Taiwan has reported 13 new deaths from Covid-19, and 262 new cases. In a sign that authorities are also clearing the backlog of test results which had seen hundreds added to previous daily totals and caused difficulties in analysing any trends, there were just 65 new positive cases announced today. Germany’s Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious disease is to reduce the coronavirus risk level for the country to “high” from “very high”, health minister Jens Spahn said. A leading scientific adviser to the UK government has repeated calls to delay the 21 June lifting of restrictions by “a few weeks”, warning the coronavirus’s ability to adapt in the face of vaccines has still left the UK in a vulnerable position. Ireland will begin to gradually phase out temporary coronavirus-related jobless payments later this year while maintaining other income and business supports as the economy fully reopens, public expenditure minister Michael McGrath. Australians who have been vaccinated against Covid would be able to leave the country and return with less strict quarantine requirements under a plan that could be trialled within six weeks. Our community team are interested to hear about your experiences of travelling through Heathrow, now that London’s airport has opened up a terminal specifically to deal with arrivals from the so-called “red list” countries. If you’ve travelled and want to get in touch with them, you can find all the details here… Australians who have been vaccinated against Covid would be able to leave the country and return with less strict quarantine requirements under a plan that could be trialled within six weeks. The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, revealed the proposal in the Coalition party room on Tuesday following a question from Liberal MP Jason Falinski, who had asked whether vaccination could see people exempted from outbound and inbound travel restrictions. Australia shut its borders in March 2020 in response to the coronavirus pandemic imposing two weeks hotel quarantine on those arriving into the country. Outbound travel is also banned – which was upheld by the full federal court on Tuesday – although more than 140,000 Australian citizens and residents have travelled overseas for critical business, on compassionate grounds or for other exempted reasons. With Australia struggling to vaccinate its population by the end of 2021, there is pressure on the federal government to provide incentives to get the jab and to ease the travel ban that has separated families. About 40,000 Australians remain stranded overseas due to flight caps imposed as a result of limited hotel quarantine beds.

These are the four you need to know: Alpha - UK/Kent (B.1.1.7) Beta - South Africa (B.1.351) Gamma - Brazil (P.1) Delta - India (B.1.617.2) For ease of use to start with, I’ll try to make sure I am using all three ways of naming each variant until we all get more acquainted with the new terminology.

The venues and the fixtures will be announced by Conmebol in the next few hours.” The tournament, featuring 10 South American nations, had been due to be held in Argentina and Colombia with joint hosts for the first time in its 105-year history. Colombia was removed as a co-host on 20 May after a wave of protests demanding social and economic change spread across the country, and Argentina has followed. Now Reuters report that Chilean national soccer star Arturo Vidal has been diagnosed with Covid-19 and is in hospital in what appears to be a an isolated case as the squad readies itself for World Cup qualifying match against Argentina on 3 June. “He was diagnosed positive for Covid in the daily preventive exam performed today,” the team said in a statement late yesterday. The team plan to travel to Argentina for the game today. A quick Reuters snap here that Germany’s Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious disease is to reduce the coronavirus risk level for the country to “high” from “very high” as the situation improves, health minister Jens Spahn said on Tuesday. “We have grounds for optimism,” said Spahn at a news conference with the head of the RKI, Lothar Wieler, who said developments were improving but the pandemic was not yet over. Ireland will begin to gradually phase out temporary coronavirus-related jobless payments later this year while maintaining other income and business supports as the economy fully reopens, public expenditure minister Michael McGrath said today. Ireland is emerging from its third and longest lockdown having had one the strictest regimes in Europe for the last 15 months, leaving more than 300,000 people who lost their jobs claiming the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP). Local media reported that the PUP, which is paid out at a higher rate than regular jobless benefits, would be reduced from September and withdrawn by February 2022. “There won’t be a cliff edge in July, we will be looking at an extension of the PUP but also laying out a pathway towards the normalisation of our social welfare code and ultimately unwinding a payment that is pandemic related,” McGrath told national broadcaster RTE. “The changes will be gradual.” The number of people temporarily or permanently unemployed in Ireland stood at 22.4% at the end April, with around three in four on the PUP. McGrath said he expected that cohort to fall very significantly over coming weeks as the economy reopens. He added that additional supports for businesses reopening would be announced later today. Padraic Halpin reminds us for Reuters that the government allowed all shops to open for the first time this year two weeks ago with the hospitality sector to follow with limited capacity in coming days. Nicola Slawson has launched our UK live blog for the day, with the leads line being the warning that the country is in a “perilous moment”. Join her for the latest UK Covid news as it comes in today. I’ll be continuing here with the latest coronavirus news from around the world. Taiwan has reported 13 new deaths from Covid-19, and 262 new cases. In a sign that authorities are also clearing the backlog of test results which had seen hundreds added to previous daily totals and caused difficulties in analysing any trends, there were just 65 new positive cases announced today. The majority of the new cases remained in the north, with 166 in New Taipei city, 87 in Taipei city, and 23 in Taoyuan. Health and welfare minister Chen Shih-Chung said reinfection rates had declined thanks to the measures introduced over the past two weeks - and the community’s cooperation with them - but said it was still not time to relax. Chen the backlog of cases was expected to be cleared in the next day or two. The daily number of vaccinations has increased, but Taiwan still remains far behind other countries, with less than 2% of its population having received a shot. Taiwan’s problems with a Covid-19 vaccination drive are complicated, and involved accusations of geopolitical interference as well as of government bungling, but the important news from recent days is that the government is now allowing private companies, religious groups and local governments to arrange imports. Tech giant Foxconn and its billionaire founder Terry Gou have sought permission to buy 5 million vaccines from Germany’s BioNTech, to distribute among the general population. Gou said on Saturday they hope to airlift the shots from Germany to Taiwan without going via any middlemen. This has received a lukewarm reaction from the government. Chen expressed his gratitude to Gou and said the government was reviewing the application, adding that while it welcomes help in obtaining vaccines from companies and religious groups, Taiwan’s government has stipulated that only it can distribute the shots. Russia has announced the resumption of air travel with Britain and a number of other countries which had been suspended due to coronavirus restrictions. “Given the improvement of the epidemiological situation in the United Kingdom, a decision has been taken to resume regular air travel between Moscow and London from 2 June,” Russian health authorities said in a statement on Monday. Russia will also resume air travel with Austria, Hungary, Lebanon, Luxembourg, Croatia, Mauritius, and Morocco from 10 June, it said. Flights to Turkey, a major tourist destination for Russians, will remain suspended until at least 21 June. AFP note that since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, Russia’s borders have remained largely closed to foreigners. Heathrow has begun processing arrivals from red list countries in a dedicated terminal following concerns about them mixing with other passengers. Travellers arriving from red list nations on direct flights are being taken to Terminal 3. Passengers travelling to the UK on connecting flights from red list locations continue to transit through the airport alongside those from green and amber countries. The red list currently consists of 43 nations from which arrivals are deemed to present a high risk of importing coronavirus. Red list countries from where direct flights to the UK are permitted include India, the Philippines, Pakistan, Kenya and Bangladesh. Passengers arriving in the UK after being in one of those destinations during the previous 10 days must spend 11 nights in a quarantine hotel, costing 1,750 for solo travellers. The decision to separate arrivals on direct flights from red list destinations was welcomed by the GMB union, which had previously warned that “bottlenecks” are putting passengers and staff at risk. Heathrow insisted there were “several layers of protection to keep passengers and colleagues safe”, such as mandatory testing for all arrivals, segregation and ventilation. PA Media notes that an airport executive said in April that passengers are being forced to queue for up to six hours to be processed through immigration halls. It is the first time Terminal 3 has been used since April 2020, when it was closed to save costs amid the collapse in demand for travel. Heathrow plans to move its new facility for processing red list arrivals to Terminal 4 “as soon as operationally possible”. The pressure to get England’s Covid restrictions dropped on 21 June is coming from several quarters, not least those sectors of the hospitality industry that are still unable to open their doors. CEO of the Night Time Industries Association, Michael Kill, has been pushing for earlier clarification of when reopening might happen. He told Sky News: Nine out of 10 late-night businesses feel that veering off the roadmap would threaten their survival. Ninety-five per cent of businesses have already made financial commitments in terms of stock, staff and entertainment. So this is a key time, and the government really needs to step up and make it very clear exactly what their intentions are. The UK’s small businesses minister Paul Scully has been on LBC this morning reiterating the message from the government that people in the UK should use “caution” in the face of the growing number of cases of the “Delta” variant of coronavirus – the B.1.617.2 variant first detected in India. He stressed again that no decision would be taken until 14 June, saying: I know for some people that won’t be quick enough, but we’ve got to make sure that we are working with the latest data, accurate data. Scientists have to be able to go through this with a fine tooth comb, because it’s a really really important decision that affects so many people. Pressed about whether the country was in fact seeing increased hospitalisations and what the threat to the NHS currently was, he said: We’ve just got to make sure that we are looking forward to see what happens in the next few weeks and months in terms of that modelling, based on the data. Because what we do know is that when case rates go up, hospitalisations to date have also gone up. But the vaccination progress is still continuing with 63 million vaccinations and that is what is going to help us win this race. Eddie Blake writes for us this morning, asking what should Britain’s memorial to the Covid pandemic look like? Memorials aim to be an eloquent last word on an event. A key quality is that they resist change: they attempt to fix for us an abiding sense of what exactly has happened. They can be many things: columns, tombs, plaques, cenotaphs, village halls, even housing. But who are they for? The people who suffered, their families, the wider public or future generations? At some point, inevitably, there will be an official, national memorial of the pandemic in the UK (as well as many more, surely, at local and international levels). What, then, should it look like? It will have to contend with how messy the past year has been – the death, the sorrow, the fear, but also the ensuing political and social division. Perhaps through all of that, memorialisation can play a therapeutic role. Memorials naturally remove some of the complexity of the past, replacing it with something smoother, better suited to a broad audience: the tomb of the Unknown Warrior doesn’t address one specific loss, so it can talk of all loss. Because of this universal ambition it is vital public memorials hit the right tone – being both honest and broadly interpretable, tending to avoid friction. As a result, though, memorials can feel as if they don’t talk to you directly or seem too vague. But at a time when narratives are brutally contested, it seems unlikely that a pandemic memorial will avoid controversy, no matter how skilful the architect. Read more here: Eddie Blake – What should Britain’s memorial to the Covid pandemic look like? Prof Adam Finn, from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, is a second expert in the UK on the airwaves today warning against further easing of domestic restrictions on 21 June. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “There’s vulnerability across the country. The idea that somehow the job is done, is wrong. “We’ve still got a lot of people out there who’ve neither had this virus … nor yet been immunised, and that’s why we’re in a vulnerable position right now.” PA Media reports Finn added: “There are a lot of people who are very fed up about the idea of us even worrying about this. Since I’ve been saying in the last 24 hours that we should be cautious I’ve been getting lots of messages from people telling me to shut up basically. “But the truth is that a more infectious virus, which is what it looks like we’ve got, will reach people who are vulnerable – those who did not make a good response to the vaccine, those who have not yet had their doses – and that will be a problem for everyone because in the end it will be worse economically as well as for public health if we end up having to shut down again.” Chinese authorities in Guangdong province have cancelled flights and locked down communities in response to what is believed to be the first community outbreak of the “Delta” or Indian variant in China. Guangdong province had been reporting daily single figures of local cases, including asymptomatic cases, for more than a week, until the case load suddenly jumped to 23 on Monday, including three asymptomatic cases, and 11 on Tuesday. Most of Guandong’s cases are in the city of Guangzhou, with some in nearby Foshan, which has a population of 7.2 million. Authorities said all cases were found to be the strain commonly known as the Indian variant of the virus, now renamed by the WHO as the “Delta” variant. “In this race against the virus, we must run a bit ahead and run faster than before in order to block the spread of the virus and cut off the infection chain in time,” said Huang Guanglie, director of the Guangzhou municipal health commission. Guangzhou deputy mayor, Li Ming, said the strain had a short incubation period, a high viral load, and spread quickly. However she said that the trajectory was “under control”. In response hundreds of flights at the busy Guangdong Baiyun international airport have been cancelled, and authorities ordered some streets in the Liwan neighbourhood of Guangzhou city to isolate at home, with only one person per household allowed out to buy daily necessities. On Sunday, all 15.3 million Guangzhou residents were barred from leaving via bus, air or train without a green code on the health management app and a negative Covid test taken in the preceding 72 hours. Read more of Helen Davidson’s report here: China locks down part of Guangzhou amid outbreak of Indian Covid variant Malaysia has begun a tough nationwide lockdown to battle a worsening coronavirus outbreak, AFP reports, as countries across Southeast Asia struggle with a resurgence in cases driven by infectious variants. It writes, Much of the region escaped the pandemic’s first wave last year relatively unscathed by rapidly closing borders and introducing curbs. But countries from Thailand to Vietnam are being hammered by fresh surges, with efforts to quell outbreaks hampered by slow vaccine rollouts and populations weary of restrictions. Malaysia is among the worst hit. Of almost 2,800 deaths from Covid-19 recorded in the country of 32 million since the start of the pandemic, over 40 percent were in May alone. More than 570,000 infections have been reported, with a string of new daily records last week. As well as variants, the outbreak has been fanned by gatherings in the Muslim-majority country during the holy month of Ramadan and the Eid al-Fitr holiday, often in defiance of coronavirus rules. Under what authorities have termed a “total lockdown” in force from Tuesday, only essential businesses - such as supermarkets and medical clinics - can operate, people can only go outside for necessities, and most schools are closed. Travel between most parts of the country had already been banned for months. Just following up on Prof Ravi Gupta’s words there with a quick check on the UK government’s own coronavirus dashboard, and we can see that with data in from 31 May now, that the rolling seven-day averages of cases, deaths and hospitalisations are all up – all admittedly from a baseline much lower than was in the earlier peak of the second wave of the virus. You can have look for yourself here. A leading scientific adviser to the UK government has repeated calls to delay the 21 June lifting of restrictions by “a few weeks”, warning the coronavirus’s ability to adapt in the face of vaccines has still left the UK in a vulnerable position. Prof Ravi Gupta, a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), said the increased socialisation which has followed last month’s phase of restriction lifting could be expected to lead to “quite a lot” of hospital admissions. PA Media reports that he told ITV’s Good Morning Britain that while the nation had performed “amazingly well” in its vaccination programme, it was still too early “to put the vaccine straight up against the virus”. Gupta said a delay of a few weeks to the 21 June target could have a significant impact on Britain’s battle against the pandemic, and recommended it should be made clear to the public that it would be a temporary measure based on recent events, chiefly the emergence of the newly-designated “Delta variant”, which we had previously been calling the B.1.617.2 strain of the virus or the variant that was first detected in India. “Even a month delay could have a big impact on the eventual outcome of this,” said Prof Gupta. He continued: “As long as it’s clear to people this is not an unlimited extension of the lockdown but actually just a reassessment, that would be realistic. “Because we didn’t plan for the 617.2 variant when the initial roadmap was made, and actually things have gone really well except for the fact that we have this new variant to complicate things. “We must remember this is a virus that does adapt, and faced with vaccines it will eventually start to make mutations to avoid them even further, and then we could be in an even more precarious situation after that.” Vietnam is seeking to buy Covid-19 vaccine production technology and wants to build a plant to supply the Covax programme, Reuters reports, as the country tries to step up vaccinations to stem a new outbreak of infections. India and South Africa are among developing countries that have been pushing for an intellectual property waiver for Covid-19 vaccines. But even with a surprise US shift last month to support a waiver World Trade Organization talks on the issue on Monday failed to achieve a breakthrough. “Vietnam would build the plant and would like to receive the patent so it could supply vaccines to Covax, to other countries as well as to Vietnam,” the health ministry said in a statement, following a meeting with Covax representatives overnight. India has reported its lowest daily rise in new coronavirus infections since 8 April at 127,510 cases over the past 24 hours, while deaths rose by 2,795, Reuters reports. The South Asian nation’s tally of infections now stands at 28.2 million, while the death toll has reached 331,895, health ministry data showed. That’s it from me, Helen Livingstone, for today. I’m handing over to my colleague Martin Belam in London. Here’s a quick roundup of what’s been happening so far: Peru has revised its official Covid-19 death toll to 180,764, nearly triple the previous official figure of 69,342, following a government review that shows the severity of the outbreak in the country. As new coronavirus variants continue to be discovered, the World Health Organization has revealed new names, after the letters of the Greek alphabet, to simplify the discussion around the variants and avoid stigma. Australia’s drug regulator says it may refer anti-vaccination Facebook posts to federal police after anti-vaccine campaigners targeted an MP who posted about getting the jab. Australia’s federal court has rejected a bid by a rightwing thinktank to overturn the country’s ban on outbound travel. US gun sales spiked during the pandemic and continue to rise, with first-time buyers making up more than a fifth of those who purchased guns Germany has pledged to crack down on fraud in coronavirus test centres, after evidence that some have been claiming for more tests than they have carried out. Scientists are urging the government to speed up second doses of Covid vaccines and delay a decision on easing lockdown restrictions in England on 21 June in an effort to tackle the creeping spread of new cases. France has opened up vaccines to all adults a week before Germany, as Europe rushed to avoid another wave of infections caused by new virus variants. Vietnam has announced the suspension of incoming international flights to its capital and tightened restrictions in its biggest city. The inbound flight suspension to Hanoi will apply from 1-7 June. Travellers from the UK will have to provide “compelling reasons” to enter France from Monday, as French authorities tighten curbs to halt the spread of the Indian Covid variant. The European Commission has proposed that all EU countries gradually ease travel measures over the summer. School closures in England during the Covid lockdown badly damaged the mental health of mothers but had no impact on fathers’ wellbeing, research has found. Here’s a sobering, but important, feature by Guardian contributor V on the ways in which the pandemic has erased women’s rights and left them vulnerable to violence. She writes, All over the world, patriarchy has taken full advantage of the virus to reclaim power – on the one hand, escalating the danger and violence to women, and on the other, stepping in as their supposed controller and protector. And in more Australia-related Covid news, the country’s drug regulator is considering referring Covid vaccine misinformation posts to the federal police, after anti-vaccine campaigners targeted an MP who posted about getting the jab. In response to a viral post of Labor backbencher Julian Hill receiving his vaccine, numerous users posted false material purportedly from the Therapeutic Goods Administration wrongly claiming Covid-19 vaccines have caused more than 200 deaths. The figure they used was in fact the number of people who have died after receiving the vaccine, but apart from one case, none have been linked by the TGA to the vaccine. The TGA told Guardian Australia the alleged posting of the death counter was “particularly concerning” and it would consider referring it to the federal police. Australia’s federal court has rejected a bid by a rightwing thinktank to overturn the country’s ban on outbound travel. Libertyworks had argued that the health minister, Greg Hunt, has no power to impose a blanket rule stopping citizens from leaving the country. But Justices Anna Katzmann, Michael Wigney and Thomas Thawley dismissed the application and ordered Libertyworks to pay the commonwealth’s costs. The federal government had argued that, if successful, the case would have “driven a truck” through Hunt’s powers under the Biosecurity Act to impose measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19 during the global pandemic.

Léone-Noëlle Meyer, 81, announced on Tuesday she had been left with “no choice” but to drop legal action to retrieve La Bergère Rentrant des Moutons (Shepherdess Bringing in Sheep) after she was threatened with large fines if she continued. Last month a Paris court ruled that a contested contract Meyer signed five years ago, sharing the Pissarro with a US university to whom it had been donated, overrode a 1945 French law requiring the restitution of Nazi looted artworks to their rightful owners. “This work of art, which belonged to my adoptive parents, Yvonne and Raoul Meyer, was stolen from them by the Nazis during the occupation of France in 1941. For almost 10 years, I have battled in order to obtain the recognition of the principle that the restitution of a pillaged work of art should occur independently of any other consideration related to its provenance, its history or its successive ‘owners’,” Meyer said in a statement on Tuesday. “But after all these years, I have to admit it has proven impossible to convince the different parties to whose attention I have brought this matter. I was heard but not listened to.” Meyer had described her battle as a “quest” on behalf of the family she lost during the Holocaust and her late adoptive parents: she lost her mother, grandmother and older brother at Auschwitz. After the war she was adopted as a seven-year-old by Yvonne and Raoul Meyer from a Paris orphanage. During the Nazi occupation, the Meyers had fled Paris, placing their art collection, which also included a Picasso, a Renoir and a Bonnard, in a bank vault where it was discovered by the Germans. Meyer’s father had tried to retrieve the Pissarro from a Swiss dealer in 1953, but was informed that his claim was too late. The painting then disappeared until 1990, when Madame Meyer discovered it was hanging in the University of Oklahoma’s Fred Jones Jr Museum of Art, having been donated by a local family who had bought it from a New York dealer. In 2016, Meyer, listed as the ninth-richest woman in France, worth an estimated €600m, agreed to share the painting with the university on the basis of a three-year rotation between France and the US. However, Meyer said afterwards that she had signed the deal under duress. “I was called at 2am and my American lawyer put me under strong pressure to accept this deal. I didn’t have the choice,” she told Le Monde. The painting, completed by Camille Pissarro in 1886 and worth an estimated €1.5m (£1.3m), is now hanging in the Musée d’Orsay in Paris but will return to Oklahoma this summer. In her statement, Meyer, who had wanted to donate the painting to the Musée d’Orsay, said she was now handing ownership of it to the University of Oklahoma. It was now up to the university to ensure the three-year rotation outlined in the 2016 agreement was maintained, she added. Her French lawyer, Ron Soffer, said: “Mrs Meyer has decided to put an end to her struggle to obtain restitution of this painting. The University of Oklahoma has now obtained full title to the painting.

He added there should have been provision in the 2016 agreement for the eventuality that it would not be possible to find a museum in France to accept the terms of the rotation. “She (Mme Meyer) signed an agreement and sadly she has to live by the agreement. It’s unfortunate she is not going to be able to get exactly what she wanted but I think her dropping the case is a wise decision,” he said. “We need to focus on the many, many Nazi looted works of art still being held by collectors, dealers, museums who are actively hiding these works from the heirs.”","charCount":"5314","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/kim-willsher\">Kim Willsher</a>"},{"headline":"UK Covid: zero deaths reported today but daily cases above 3,000 – as it happened","standfirst":"<p>This live blog is now closed: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2021/jun/01/coronavirus-live-news-peru-death-toll-more-than-doubles-after-review-who-renames-variants\">For more coronavirus news, you can head to our global blog</a></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/01/zero-daily-covid-deaths-announced-in-uk\">Zero daily deaths reported in UK for first time since pandemic start</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/01/uk-facing-perilous-moment-as-indian-covid-variant-spreads\">Boris Johnson says no evidence to delay England reopening</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/jun/01/nicola-sturgeon-confirms-glasgow-covid-restrictions-will-ease\">Nicola Sturgeon confirms Glasgow Covid restrictions will ease</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus global updates – live</a><br></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul>","trailText":"UK records no new deaths within 28 days of a positive test but 3,165 new cases amid warnings the pandemic is not over ","byline":"Nicola Slawson (now) and Damien Gayle (earlier)","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3c51aab729bbbef8c060c17cec5d862af91b9c48\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c51aab729bbbef8c060c17cec5d862af91b9c48/0_299_4563_2737/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A volunteer adds hearts to the Covid-19 memorial wall outside St Thomas’ hospital in London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A volunteer adds hearts to the Covid-19 memorial wall outside St Thomas’ hospital in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<div id=\"block-60b65a888f082e80569f309a\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-01T16:11:58.271Z\">5.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here’s a roundup of the key developments so far today:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Former chief scientific adviser to the government Professor Sir Mark Walport said the UK was in a “perilous moment” and potentially on the cusp of a third wave</strong> but that more data was needed before the final decision could be made about the June 21 easing of restrictions.</li> <li><strong>Heathrow has begun processing arrivals from red list countries in a dedicated terminal following concerns about them mixing with other passengers</strong>.

The only thing we know, he helpfully suggests, is that we don’t know.</p> <p>Here’s a flash of his column. </p> <blockquote> <p>England faces the tensest two weeks of its entire lockdown. On 14 June, the government must decide if the long-promised “freedom day” of 21 June can proceed as promised. That promise has now been plunged into doubt. A three-day surge in “cases” of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/31/india-covid-variant-spreading-across-england-data-shows\">variant of Covid first detected in India</a> may, or may not, mark the start of a third wave of the coronavirus. Boris Johnson has promised that any more lockdown will be over his dead body, but Johnson’s body has already lost more lives than the proverbial cat.</p> <p>We now know, thanks to the new patron saint of whistleblowers, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/dominic-cummings\">Dominic Cummings</a>, the scale of government ineptitude and shambles that attended the first two lockdowns. People can now scream at ministers to make up their minds, show judgment, give a steer, keep their promises. But today the issue is not one of judgment, but of facts. We await data much as a nation awaits news of a battle in distant parts. Without news, we cannot think how to act.</p> <p>The caveats are easy to recite. We hear them every day. Has not Britain’s campaign of vaccination and treatment curbed what is still a rampant disease across Europe? Perhaps the upsurge in cases is due to the intensity of testing in hotspots such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/31/blackburn-with-darwen-overtakes-bolton-to-top-uk-list-of-most-new-covid-cases\">Bolton and Blackburn</a>. There is no sign of the upsurge reflected in hospital admissions, let alone deaths. Surely we have spent all this money showing the NHS can handle any new wave without lockdown. Thousands of businesses and the country’s morale will be devastated if promises of normality on 21 June are not met.</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/01/freedom-day-england-21-june-covid\">Will ‘freedom day’ go ahead?

Many of the scientists who’ve been talking over the weekend simply haven’t adjusted their expectations to understand that - (for these people) Covid is a mild illness in the community.</p> <p>As the Director of Public Health Bolton was saying last week, the people who are going into hospital... it’s not like January, these are not desperately ill people.</p> <p>They’re people who need a little bit of extra support with oxygen, they need access to the dexamethasone treatment, which is very effective.</p> <p>They go in, stay in hospital for three or four days and they go out again.

Heathrow has begun processing arrivals from red list countries in a dedicated terminal following concerns about them mixing with other passengers. Travellers arriving from red list nations on direct flights are being taken to Terminal 3. The job of the Covid-19 vaccination programme is not yet “done”, an immunisation expert has said as scientists are split on whether the government should press ahead with the final stages of easing social restrictions later this month. Covid-19 case rates are starting to rise steeply in more areas of north-west England, though rates in Bolton are continuing to fall, new analysis shows. The widespread rise in Covid-19 cases has led to a small rise in hospital admissions on a national level, according to Guardian analysis of NHS data. Boris Johnson sees nothing in current coronavirus data to suggest the end to coronavirus lockdown restrictions will need to be delayed past 21 June, Downing Street has indicated. Glasgow is to move from level 3 to level 2 of the Scottish government’s coronavirus restrictions from Saturday, Nicola Sturgeon has said. Teachers’ unions have criticised government plans to extend the school day in England by 30 minutes and said they could potentially do “more harm than good”. The UK reported no deaths from Covid-19 in its daily update today, according to the latest update. This is the first time the figure has been at zero since July last year. We’re closing the live blog now. Thanks so much for joining me. Our global live blog will still be continuing, which you can follow here: Government data up to May 31 shows that of the 65,211,877 jabs given in the UK so far, 39,477,158 were first doses – a rise of 93,103 on the previous day. Some 25,734,719 were second doses, an increase of 195,546. The UK reported no deaths from Covid-19 in its daily update today, according to the latest update. This is the first time the figure has been at zero since July last year. In total 127,782 have died within 28 days of testing positive for the virus and more than 150,000 people have had Covid-19 recorded on their death certificate. The update also shows that 3,165 people tested positive reported on 1 June 2021. In total 4,490,438 people have tested positive since the pandemic began. If Dominic Cummings is to be believed, Boris Johnson was so sceptical that Covid-19 was a threat early last year that he was willing to inject himself with the virus that causes the disease on television. But there are actual volunteers – young and healthy people – who elected to be infected with the virus, all in the name of science. These volunteers lined up to participate in “human challenge trials”, which have long been successfully employed to develop vaccines for diseases from typhoid to cholera. The world’s first such trial for Covid kicked off in the UK this March with scientists attempting to establish the minimum dose of the virus required to cause infection in volunteers aged 18 to 30. However, Cummings, in his seven-hour appearance before a Commons inquiry hearing last week, suggested that the challenge trials should have been initiated much earlier. Had that been done, he said, the vaccination rollout could have kicked off in September 2020 instead of months later. Read more here: Teachers’ unions have criticised government plans to extend the school day in England by 30 minutes and said they could potentially do “more harm than good”. Education unions also said that the £1.5bn funding package fell far below levels needed to help children catch up on learning lost because of the pandemic. The unions’ comments came in response to a plan drawn up by Sir Kevan Collins, the government’s education recovery commissioner, which proposes a minimum 35-hour week and 100 hours of additional schooling compared with existing timetables in many state schools and colleges. However, those close to the negotiations say that, despite No 10’s support, opposition from the Treasury could mean the scheme is significantly reduced in scope from Collins’ proposals, with its anticipated £1.5bn funding allocation falling 10 times below the £15bn recommended by the commissioner. Commenting on the report, which was leaked to the Times newspaper this week, Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of school leaders’ union NAHT, said: The marginal gains that might be possible through extending the school day must be weighed against the costs of such a strategy, including the impact on pupils’ mental health, reduced family time and less time for extra-curricular activities. The government could end up doing more harm than good by adding more classroom hours to children’s school day. Read the full story here: Boris Johnson stands by his comments that there is nothing in the data to suggest a deviation from England’s reopening on 21 June, Downing Street has said, as scientists said the UK was facing a perilous moment. The business minister Paul Scully also said on Tuesday there was “cautious optimism” that the date for the final lifting of restrictions could go ahead as planned. He told Times Radio the government did not want to have to roll back restrictions again. He said: One thing that we saw last year, before Christmas, was the stop-start nature just didn’t work for businesses and cost them more. So we’ve got to get it absolutely right. People’s jobs and livelihoods depend on it. There was jubilation in Glasgow as the city was finally placed in level 2 of Scotland’s Covid controls from midnight on Friday, with residents able to hug and meet in each others’ homes for the first time in eight months. But 13 other local authority areas must remain in level 2, Nicola Sturgeon said, rather than the further easing to level 1 that had been expected. Nicola Sturgeon insisted that today’s decisions did not take areas backwards, while setting out that “a slight slowing down of the easing of restrictions, to allow time for more people to be fully vaccinated, will help protect our progress overall”. Sturgeon said: As someone who lives in Glasgow, I know they will make a huge difference to quality of life. This means that people in Glasgow - as has been the case in most of the rest of Scotland since mid May - will be able to meet in homes in groups of no more than 6, from a maximum of 3 households. It also means that indoor licensed hospitality can reopen, and that people can travel again between Glasgow and the other parts of Scotland. In addition to Glasgow, the following areas will remain in level 2: Edinburgh and Midlothian, Dundee, East Dunbartonshire, Renfrewshire and East Renfrewshire, the 3 Ayrshires, North and South Lanarkshire and Clackmannanshire and Stirling. The following areas will move to level 1 from midnight on Saturday: Highland, Argyll &amp; Bute, Aberdeen City and Aberdeenshire, Moray, Angus, Perth &amp; Kinross, Falkirk, Fife, Inverclyde, East and West Lothian, West Dunbartonshire, Dumfries &amp; Galloway and the Borders, meaning that limits on meetings in indoor public places increase to 8 people from 3 households; and outdoors to 12 people from 12 households; 100 people as opposed to 50 can attend weddings and funerals; and soft play centres and funfairs can reopen. A total of 54,883,579 Covid-19 vaccinations took place in England between 8 December and 1 June, according to NHS England data, including first and second doses, which is a rise of 225,622 on the previous day. NHS England said 33,009,444 were the first dose of a vaccine, a rise of 70,948 on the previous day, while 21,874,135 were a second dose, an increase of 154,674. There have been no further Covid-19 deaths recorded by Stormont’s Department of Health in the last 24-hour reporting period. There were another 54 confirmed cases of the virus recorded. On Tuesday morning there were 20 confirmed Covid-19 inpatients in hospital, of whom two were in intensive care. The vast majority of Scotland’s central belt will remain in level 2 restrictions, Nicola Sturgeon has said. The first minister said that Edinburgh and Midlothian, Dundee, East Dunbartonshire, Renfrewshire, East Renfrewshire, North, South and East Ayrshire, North and South Lanarkshire, Clackmannanshire and Stirling did not meet the criteria to see restrictions ease. Sturgeon told MSPs there could even be an argument to move these areas into level 3 restrictions, given the raw figures, but the impact of the vaccination programme has meant this would not be needed. She said: However, it is important to stress that this is a pause, not a step backwards. And level 2 is not lockdown. It does have an impact on opening hours of pubs and restaurants and the numbers that can attend certain events. And taking a cautious approach now - while more people get fully vaccinated - gives us the best chance of staying on the right track overall. Sturgeon has said 18 local authorities will see restrictions ease this weekend. Sturgeon urged caution as the restrictions ease, reminding Scots that outdoor meetings were less likely to cause transmission of the virus. Glasgow is to move from level 3 to level 2 of the Scottish government’s coronavirus restrictions from Saturday, Nicola Sturgeon has said. Updating MSPs in Holyrood the first minister said Scotland’s biggest city, which had been held back due to recent case spikes, will see restrictions ease. Sturgeon said the situation in Glasgow appears to be stabilising, with case rates falling from 146 per 100,000 to 129 in recent days. The first minister said: This means that people in Glasgow - as has been the case in most of the rest of Scotland since mid-May - will be able to meet in homes in groups of no more than six, from a maximum of three households. It also means that indoor licensed hospitality can reopen, and that people can travel again between Glasgow and the other parts of Scotland. A number of venues will also be permitted to reopen, and outdoor adult contact sports can resume. These changes are significant. As someone who lives in Glasgow, I know they will make a huge difference to quality of life. The Guardian columnist Simon Jenkins has written on the topic on everyone’s lips right now, will “freedom day” – the lifting of the last lockdown restrictions on 21 June – go ahead? The only thing we know, he helpfully suggests, is that we don’t know. Here’s a flash of his column. England faces the tensest two weeks of its entire lockdown. On 14 June, the government must decide if the long-promised “freedom day” of 21 June can proceed as promised. That promise has now been plunged into doubt. A three-day surge in “cases” of the variant of Covid first detected in India may, or may not, mark the start of a third wave of the coronavirus. Boris Johnson has promised that any more lockdown will be over his dead body, but Johnson’s body has already lost more lives than the proverbial cat. We now know, thanks to the new patron saint of whistleblowers, Dominic Cummings, the scale of government ineptitude and shambles that attended the first two lockdowns. People can now scream at ministers to make up their minds, show judgment, give a steer, keep their promises. But today the issue is not one of judgment, but of facts. We await data much as a nation awaits news of a battle in distant parts. Without news, we cannot think how to act. The caveats are easy to recite. We hear them every day. Has not Britain’s campaign of vaccination and treatment curbed what is still a rampant disease across Europe? Perhaps the upsurge in cases is due to the intensity of testing in hotspots such as Bolton and Blackburn. There is no sign of the upsurge reflected in hospital admissions, let alone deaths. Surely we have spent all this money showing the NHS can handle any new wave without lockdown. Thousands of businesses and the country’s morale will be devastated if promises of normality on 21 June are not met. Ninety-four more people have tested positive for coronavirus in Wales, taking the total number of confirmed infections in the country so far to 212,796. According to the latest data released by Public Health Wales on Tuesday, there had been no new deaths attributed to Covid-19. The total pandemic death toll in the country stood at 5,569. Public Health Wales said a total of 2,147,274 first doses of the Covid-19 vaccine had now been given and 1,118,396 second doses have also been administered. Boris Johnson sees nothing in current coronavirus data to suggest the end to coronavirus lockdown restrictions will need to be delayed past 21 June, Downing Street has indicated. According to PA Media, a No 10 spokesperson was asked about the prime minister’s plans amid the warnings over the spread of the variant first detected in India, which now accounts for three quarters of new infections in the UK. Over the past few days, a number of government scientific advisers have gone on the record to urge caution over the end to lockdown. There have been repeated warnings that the country is possibly in the early stages of a third wave of pandemic. PA Media quoted the prime minister’s spokesperson as saying: “I was going to point to what the PM said on Thursday. “The prime minister has said on a number of occasions that we haven’t seen anything in the data but we will continue to look at the data, we will continue to look at the latest scientific evidence as we move through June towards 21 June.” Last Thursday, Johnson said “I don’t see anything currently in the data” to divert from the 21 June. But he did concede that “we may need to wait” for more data. (This is Damien Gayle at the controls of the live blog for the next hour or so, while Nicola has a break.) The widespread rise in Covid-19 cases has led to a small rise in hospital admissions on a national level, according to Guardian analysis of NHS data. The seven-day average figure for England showed that 88 patients were admitted to hospital on 26 May, up from 81 patients on average two weeks previously. In the north-west, which contains a number of Covid hotspots, the seven-day average for new daily hospital admissions has risen to 23 patients, up from 13 two weeks previously. In other regions, admissions continued to fall or rose slightly. Hospitalisation figures remain well below numbers seen in the peaks of previous waves. There is a median delay of up to 10 days between symptom onset and hospitalisation, according to research, so we may not yet have seen the full impact of recent Covid-19 outbreaks. Covid-19 case rates are starting to rise steeply in more areas of north-west England, though rates in Bolton are continuing to fall, new analysis shows. In Rossendale the rate currently stands at 316.2 cases per 100,000 people, up week-on-week from 76.9; in Hyndburn it has risen from 66.6 to 162.9; and in Ribble Valley it is up from 24.6 to 129.7, PA news reports. These areas – all parts of Lancashire – are now recording some of the highest rates in the UK. Blackburn with Darwen, also in Lancashire, remains the area with the highest rate in the country: 416.2, up from 281.2. But while rates in Bolton have fallen week-on-week from 452.1 to 386.0, other areas of Greater Manchester, such as Bury (up from 61.3 to 96.9), Manchester (59.7 to 100.4) and Salford (32.1 to 98.1) are now recording a sharp rise. The latest case rates are for the seven days to May 27, and have been calculated by the PA news agency using Public Health England data. A pensioner, an NHS worker, and a gig economy worker are attempting to bring a legal challenge to the UK government’s charges for hotel quarantine regulations via judicial review. The rules state that UK and Irish citizens and residents who wish to return to England from “red-list” countries must pay an upfront cost of £1,750 to quarantine in a government-designated hotel, and over £3,000 for a family of four. The claimants, who are raising funds via CrowdJustice, argue that the charges breach international law, the World Health Organisation’s international health regulations, as well as equalities and human rights law. There is currently no discretion for people travelling for compassionate or emergency reasons and there is no way for people to pay a reduced fee. The only exemption to upfront payment is a deferred payment plan over a maximum of 12 months which is reserved for people facing emergency financial hardship. Law firm PGMBM has taken the case on a pro bono basis and has instructed barristers Adam Wagner and Cian Murphy of Doughty Street Chambers to challenge the regulations. Taylor Burgess, a senior associate at PGMBM, said: This policy has been ill thought out and has caused a tremendous amount of stress for people. There has been little to no consideration of how this cost will impact people on low incomes. The World Health Organisation’s international health regulations 2005 clearly prohibit charges for quarantine. Our clients believe it is unlawful for the government to operate a policy of charging the same fee of £1,750 to all people who wish to return to England regardless of their individual financial circumstances. One of the people involved in the case, (“Mr M”), is an NHS worker who travelled to Ethiopia in early March to visit his dying uncle and to care for his unwell mother. Shortly after his departure, Ethiopia was added to the “red-list”. He is unable to return to his home and essential role as a key worker as he cannot afford to pay £1,750 to be quarantined. “Mrs B” is a pensioner who travelled to South Africa in October last year to attend her son’s wedding. She was due to arrive home prior to the hotel quarantine regulations coming into force but, after her flight was cancelled, she arrived on 15 February - the day the regulations came into force. Despite receiving a modest pension, Mrs B was asked to pay £1,750 for a hotel quarantine package. The third claimant, (“Mr E”), is a gig economy worker. In early April, Mr E travelled to Pakistan to visit his severely unwell father, who died shortly after Mr E’s arrival. Mr E earns minimum wage and works under a zero-hours contract. To return to England, Mr E was forced to use his family’s emergency savings to pay the upfront fee of £1,750 for his quarantine package. The UK is facing a “quite perilous moment” as the Delta coronavirus variant, first identified in India, takes over, accounting for three-quarters of cases, with no indication yet if the 21 June lifting of restrictions in England will be put on hold. The government’s former chief scientific adviser, Prof Sir Mark Walport, said it was “not impossible” that the country was in the foothills of new wave. “I hope not, but it’s not impossible,” Walport told BBC Breakfast. While the B.1.1.7 variant, or “UK variant”, was disappearing, the B.1.617.2 variant, or India variant, was taking over, he said. The World Health Organization has renamed B.1.1.7 as the Alpha variant, and B.1.617.2 as the Delta variant. Walport said: “It is a quite perilous moment, but we’ve just got to keep our fingers crossed that the measures work.” He added: “It’s clear that the B.1.617.2 variant is taking over – it accounts for about 75% of those cases which have been typed – the numbers of infections are getting up, but we would expect that. “On the much better news side is the fact that hospital admissions are not surging. If anything, overall they’re coming down, though in some parts of the country where the B.1.617 is at its worst they are increasing slightly, so it is genuinely very, very finely balanced.” More data was needed before a final decision could be made about the 21 June easing of restrictions, he said. “We need to substitute speculation for scientific data that’s the truth of the matter, as everyone has said in the last few days, the situation is very delicately balanced with some three sets of moving parts. Read the full story here: An expert advising the government’s coronavirus response warned that having to reimpose lockdown restrictions would be both worse economically and for public health. Discussing his warning over the 21 June unlocking, Professor Adam Finn, from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: There are a lot of people who are very fed up about the idea of us even worrying about this. Since I’ve been saying in the last 24 hours that we should be cautious I’ve been getting lots of messages from people telling me to shut up basically. But the truth is that a more infectious virus, which is what it looks like we’ve got, will reach people who are vulnerable - those who did not make a good response to the vaccine, those who have not yet had their doses - and that will be a problem for everyone because in the end it will be worse economically as well as for public health if we end up having to shut down again. Asked about whether final restrictions should be eased on June 21, Finn told LBC radio: “I fear it may be a bad decision to go with it.” Asked about the businesses which may not survive further delay, he added: I think they are more likely not to survive if we open up and then shut down again. I’m no business person, and shouldn’t really be commenting on business, but it seems to me that if we can progressively get back to a place where we’re living normally that would be the better thing. But he added that the final decision to unlock lies with politicians, adding: Scientists advise but they don’t decide, and ultimately the politicians have to carry the can for whatever decisions are made. The job of the Covid-19 vaccination programme is not yet “done”, an immunisation expert has said as scientists are split on whether the government should press ahead with the final stages of easing social restrictions later this month. Professor Adam Finn, of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), said there are still many people who are vulnerable to the effects of Covid-19 as he warned “the idea that somehow the job is done is wrong”. Experts are divided over whether the final stage of easing social restrictions should press ahead on June 21 amid a surge in cases of the new variant first identified in India. Finn, from the University of Bristol, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: There’s vulnerability across the country. The idea that somehow the job is done is wrong. We’ve still got a lot of people out there who’ve neither had this virus ... nor yet been immunised, and that’s why we’re in a vulnerable position right now. He told LBC that pressing ahead with the easing of restrictions on June 21 “may be a bad decision”. Professor Ravi Gupta, a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), said a delay of a few weeks could have a significant impact on Britain’s battle against the pandemic and recommended it should be made clear to the public that it would be a temporary measure based on the surge in cases of the new variant. “Even a month delay could have a big impact on the eventual outcome of this,” Gupta told ITV’s Good Morning Britain. However, Robert Dingwall, professor of sociology at Nottingham Trent University, said it was important to press ahead with the June 21 easing from a societal point of view. He told Times Radio: I personally don’t see any case for delay ... from a societal point of view, I think it’s really important that we go ahead on June 21 and I’ve not really seen anything in the data that would lead me to doubt that as a proposition on the evidence to date. I think we need to recognise the way in which levels of fear and anxiety in the population have been amplified over the last 15 months or so. Domino’s Pizza is aiming to hire 5,000 chefs and delivery drivers, as consumers’ appetite for takeaways remains strong, at a time when the hospitality industry is battling staff shortages. Britain’s biggest pizza delivery chain said it had recruited just over 8,000 people in 2020 to meet demand, including hairdressers, taxi drivers and event managers who were not able to work as usual during lockdown. However, as Covid restrictions ease, some of Domino’s pandemic recruits are returning to their previous roles. As a result, the chain needs more staff for its 1,100 UK branches, most of which are run by franchisees. The firm has previously announced plans to open a further 200 outlets. Domino’s search for new employees comes amid warnings from the hospitality industry that it is facing a staffing crisis, with businesses trying to fill thousands of vacancies. Read the full story here: A scientific adviser to the government has repeated calls to delay the June 21 lifting of pandemic restrictions by “a few weeks”, warning that the ability of coronavirus to adapt in the face of vaccines has still left the UK in a vulnerable position. Professor Ravi Gupta, a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), said the UK’s pandemic picture had changed since its road map to recovery was drawn up, chiefly through the emergence of the Indian of B1617.2 strain of the virus, PA news reports. He also warned the increased socialisation following last month’s easing of restrictions could lead to “quite a lot” of hospital admissions, and said while Britain had performed “amazingly well” in its vaccination programme, it was still too early “to put the vaccine straight up against the virus”. Prof Gupta told ITV’s Good Morning Britain moving back the June 21 target date could have a significant impact on the fight against the pandemic, adding it should be made clear to the public this would be a temporary measure based on recent developments. More than 39 million people have been given a first jab and a further 25.3 million have had both doses. Asked whether a three-week delay to the June 21 target would be sufficient while Britons were being vaccinated at a rate of four million per week, he said: Even a month delay could have a big impact on the eventual outcome of this. As long as it’s clear to people this is not an unlimited extension of the lockdown but actually just a reassessment, that would be realistic. Because we didn’t plan for the 617.2 variant when the initial road map was made, and actually things have gone really well except for the fact that we have this new variant to complicate things. We must remember this is a virus that does adapt, and faced with vaccines it will eventually start to make mutations to avoid them even further, and then we could be in an even more precarious situation after that. Gupta said the UK was in “a really good position” in regard to its vaccination programme but caution remained crucial. He said: The key thing here is that we’re almost there. The problem is we don’t want to put the vaccine straight up against the virus at a time when the vaccine coverage isn’t quite high enough; it’s not in young people, it’s not in schoolchildren, and that’s where the virus may potentially start circulating. We still have a lot of vulnerable people in the community who haven’t responded to the vaccine. Gupta said it was concerning that hospital admissions could be about to rise following last month’s easing of restrictions, at a time when hospitals were dealing with large backlogs of procedures and treatments delayed because of the pandemic. He said: If we’re fully unlocked on the 21st of June, we have a situation where over the next few weeks there will be a lot of mixing, there will be gatherings, because people have been waiting to do these things for a long time. So we will get an excess of mixing, especially in younger groups, and that will lead to some hospitalisations... quite a lot, at a time when the NHS is trying to distance within hospitals, so it does take time to get things done there, and the added pressure of having Covid cases, some of which will be severe of course, is going to have an effect on morale and clinical care for everybody. Robert Dingwall, professor of sociology at Nottingham Trent University, said “critics” who have suggested that the June 21 easing should be delayed “can’t even agree on what delay they’d like”. He told Times Radio: By the time we get to June 21, everybody who is in the nine priority groups or the highest risk will have had both jabs, and would have had a period of time to consolidate the immunity. What are we going on with is really running into younger age groups who are intrinsically much lower risk. Many of the scientists who’ve been talking over the weekend simply haven’t adjusted their expectations to understand that - (for these people) Covid is a mild illness in the community. As the Director of Public Health Bolton was saying last week, the people who are going into hospital... it’s not like January, these are not desperately ill people. They’re people who need a little bit of extra support with oxygen, they need access to the dexamethasone treatment, which is very effective. They go in, stay in hospital for three or four days and they go out again. There is no realistic prospect of the NHS facing the sorts of pressures that it faced in January and February. And that’s why I think we have to we have to push on with this. Heathrow has begun processing arrivals from red list countries in a dedicated terminal following concerns about them mixing with other passengers. Travellers arriving from red list nations on direct flights are being taken to Terminal 3. Passengers travelling to the UK on connecting flights from red list locations continue to transit through the airport alongside those from green and amber countries. The red list currently consists of 43 nations from which arrivals are deemed to present a high risk of importing coronavirus. Passengers arriving in the UK after being in one of those destinations during the previous 10 days must spend 11 nights in a quarantine hotel, costing 1,750 for solo travellers. Red list countries from where direct flights to the UK are permitted include India, the Philippines, Pakistan, Kenya and Bangladesh. The decision to separate arrivals on direct flights from red list destinations was welcomed by the GMB union, which had previously warned that “bottlenecks” are putting passengers and staff at risk. Heathrow insisted there were “several layers of protection to keep passengers and colleagues safe”, such as mandatory testing for all arrivals, segregation and ventilation. An airport executive said in April that passengers are being forced to queue for up to six hours to be processed through immigration halls. It is the first time Terminal 3 has been used since April 2020, when it was closed to save costs amid the collapse in demand for travel. Heathrow plans to move its new facility for processing red list arrivals to Terminal 4 “as soon as operationally possible”. Meanwhile, Robert Boyle, former director of strategy at British Airways’ parent company IAG, has predicted that Bahrain, Costa Rica, Trinidad and Tobago, and Kuwait will be added to the red list “shortly” due to rising infection rates. He wrote in a blog post: Given how much heat the government is taking about the delays in adding India to the red list, you might wonder why the four red list candidates haven’t already been added. But ministers are also under heavy pressure to open up travel, not only from beleaguered airlines and other travel companies, but also from parts of the media chafing against what many see as unjustified state restrictions on liberty. Robert Dingwall, professor of sociology at Nottingham Trent University, said that it was important to press ahead with the June 21 easing from a societal point of view. He told Times Radio: I personally, I don’t see any case for delay... from a societal point of view, I think it’s really important that we go ahead on June 21, and I’ve not really seen anything in the data that would lead me to doubt that as a proposition on the evidence to date. I think we need to recognise the way in which levels of fear and anxiety in the population have been amplified over the last 15 months or so. We’ve got to look at the collateral damage in terms of untreated cancers, untreated heart conditions, all of the other things that people suffer from. We’ve got to think about the impact of economic damage that would be caused by further periods of delay and uncertainty. What we see at the moment I think is really a preview of what it means to live with Covid as an endemic infection – these waves will come, they will pass through; there will be high levels of mild infections in the community for periods of time, a handful of people may be seriously ill, even fewer may die. But that’s what happens with respiratory viruses, and we’ve lived with 30-odd respiratory viruses for since forever. Former chief scientific adviser to the government, Professor Sir Mark Walport, said the UK was in a “perilous moment” and potentially on the cusp of a third wave but that more data was needed before the final decision could be made about the June 21 easing of restrictions. He told BBC Breakfast: We need to substitute speculation for scientific data that’s the truth of the matter, as everyone has said in the last few days, the situation is very delicately balanced with some three sets of moving parts. Firstly we have got a new more transmissible variant, of that there is no doubt, though we don’t know exactly how much more transmissible. Secondly, there’s been a change in behaviour following the relaxation of measures on May 17, and the effects of that will just be starting to come through. And thirdly, we’ve got a vaccination programme that is very successful, but with a lot of people that still need both their second dose of vaccine and vaccination from scratch. I’m afraid that weeks before the Prime Minister has to make the difficult decision it is going to be necessary to bring in the data. Asked if the nation is “in the foothills of another wave”, Walport told said he hoped not but that “it’s not impossible”. He said: That’s the reality of it - we have got a new variant and it is taking off, where the B.1.1.7 variant was disappearing. It is a quite perilous moment, but we’ve just got to keep our fingers crossed that the measures work. He added it was clear that the B.1.617.2 variant (also known as the India variant) is “taking over “. He said: It accounts for about 75% of those cases which have been typed - the numbers of infections are getting up, but we would expect that. On the much better news side is the fact that hospital admissions are not surging. If anything, overall they’re coming down, though in some parts of the country where the B.1.617 is at its worst they are increasing slightly, so it is genuinely very, very finely balanced.

Both league games contested by the side finished all square at 1-1 so today’s match may come down to a test of who can hold their nerve in a stressful game worth – apologies but we’re obliged to mention it – around £170m to the winners.","charCount":"4573","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/barryglendenning\">Barry Glendenning</a>"},{"headline":"Lancashire v Yorkshire, Durham v Essex and more: county cricket – live!","standfirst":"<ul><li>County Championship latest from around the grounds</li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2021/may/28/lancashire-v-yorkshire-durham-v-essex-and-more-county-cricket-live\">Lancashire well on top in the Roses match after two days</a></li><li>Get in touch! <a href=\"mailto:tanya.aldred.freelance@theguardian.com\">Email Tanya</a>, tweet <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tjaldred\">@tjaldred</a> or post BTL</li></ul>","trailText":"Live updates from the County Championship.

Keaton Jennings was the master builder, crafting his first red-ball century since he made 146 not out for England against Sri Lanka in November 2018. After a couple of years in the wilderness, this season he has rediscovered both touch and brio. Away he chugged, putting on 19 runs in the first 45 minutes with Luke Wells, but there were occasional boulders as well as bricks, as skimming cover drives and gleaming late cuts were plucked from the level.</p> <p><strong>Yorkshire</strong> plugged away, throwing on Dom Bess, his baggy trousers and shaggy hair a sharp contrast to Jennings’ ironed creases and buttoned cuffs. Yorkshire eventually got their hands on the new ball they had been after all day, and it tookonly five overs to make a breakthrough as Jennings was caught at first slip after a partnership of 175 with Wells. One became three as Wells, then Livingstone followed. But on Lancashire went. For a while it seemed they would try for maximum batting bonus points as Dane Vilas straight drove Steven Patterson for four, then dropped to one knee and pulled him behind square, and Bess was biffed for straight sixes, with Josh Bohannon reaching the scorers’ box high in the media centre. But sense soon prevailed and the grind, grind, grind returned.</p> <p>A sixth wicket stand of 125 between Ryan ten Doeschate (55) and Adam Wheater (81) rescued <strong>Essex</strong> from an unbecoming 53 for five to finish the day with a towering lead at Chester-le-Street. <strong>Durham </strong>were earlier bowled out for 99; such was the haste of their demise that Simon Harmer didn’t even get to wrap his bowling fingers around the ball.</p> <p>Saif Zaib’s 64 helped <strong>Northants</strong> to a handy first-innings lead at Hove. After a post-tea wobble, Tom Haines and Ben Brown inched <strong>Sussex </strong>ahead.</p> <p>Lewis Hill and Callum Parkinson were the only players to make their mark on <strong>Leicestershire</strong>’s first innings of 136.

And a great preview of the New Zealand series, which starts on Wednesday! No jacket required at lunch at Old Trafford. On my turn of the ground I saw a couple of 99’s gingerly making their way back to their seats, a man in an MCC blazer and matching face mask, and a good handful of children. Here are the Grahams, enjoying a family outing at OT for the first time post lockdown (though Peter has been here every day the match). Happy Birthday for Monday Kian and Zavi! Seat banging and mucho applause as Danny Lamb reaches his fifty with a single off Danny Brook. Off a 142 balls in a vital seventh-wicket partnership as Yorkshire just wait for the trials ahead. An email pops up from Andrew Benton: “Every time I see your name I connect in my head to a film called Ptang Yang Kipperbang, which was on Channel 4 soon after it started broadcasting (40-odd years ago now). I saw it then, as a lad, then forgot about it. Finally I checked it out and am reminded it’s about cricket (!) and more, with John Arlott providing a commentary on the adolescent protagonists life. Perhaps recommended viewing for non-match days (or the Hundred, if that flops!)“ Thank you Andrew! A lovely interview by Kevin Howells with Vic Marks on the radio now. Group One Riverside: Durham 99 all out and 47-1 v Essex 182 all out and 301 Edgbaston: Warwickshire 341 all out v Nottinghamshire 274-8 New Road: Worcestershire 421 all out v Derbyshire 193-5 Group Two Grace Road: Leicestershire 136 v Middlesex 295 and 125-4 The Oval: Surrey 473 all out v Gloucestershire 113-6 Group Three Old Trafford: Lancashire 439-6 v Yorkshire 159 all out Hove: Sussex 175 all out and 241-7 v Northants 256 all out And that is lunch, as a weary Yorkshire dawdle off the field. The Lancashire lead, 280. Scores to follow. Emma Lamb has reached her hundred, 107 not out, against Western Storm; Peter Handsomb and John Simpson at the crease for Middlesex, who have lost three this morning, but have a healthy padding of 284 over Leicestershire With an over to go, Bohannon needs another eight for his century, Danny Lamb ten for his fifty. Lancs 439-6. A third wicket to Simon Kerrigan at Hove- Tom Haines out for a marvellous 103. And Gloucestershire in deep trouble at The Oval! Brathwaited 38, Hammond 44 not out, but a sorry tale otherwise of noughts and ones as the spinners weave their web : three for Virdi, two for Moriarty. Hammond not out 44 and Tattersall, on loan from Yorkshire, one. And, according to the commentators, the pitch isn’t even spinning yet. If anyone is interested, these were the thoughts of Steven Patterson yesterday. Incidentally, we think that if Derbyshire make 200, Yorkshire will have the lowest number of batting points in the country. “It was an horrendous start for us (with the bat). But fair play to them, they’ve played good cricket throughout and have not let us back in the game. We now find ourselves right up against it. “I thought Keaton Jennings and Luke Wells showed us, in a sense, how to bat on a good surface. When you get the opportunity, make it count. “They didn’t score at a particularly quick rate at any stage, but they made it hard work for us and ground us down. “I can’t question the lads character and effort today. It’s a good surface and hard to get wickets on. “To go at two and a half an over for the first 120 overs is a good effort and a testament to the bowlers skills. But, at the end of the day, we can’t keep expecting the bowlers to pull us out of trouble.” Happy to see Barnard and Pennington in the wickets at New Road - Derby in a bit of pickle at 148-5. Not to worry Yorkshire, but Dom Bess is just starting to find a bit of a twist on the pitch. Notts continuing to bleed wickets, now 237-7, but Sussex are on a roll. Tom Haines 94 not out, Ben Brown 54 not out. A partnership of 96 which has given Sussex a sniff of a chance of fighting for a place in Division One. Their lead over Northants, 114. Thanks to Romeo for pointing out that I’d filed some absolute gibberish about live streams (he was a lot more polite!). I’ll try again: Some amazing live stream data: on day one of the Roses match, Lancashire picked up 159,000 hits via facebook and youtube, and 153,000 on day two. This is compared with an average of 150,000 over a four day match. Plus more watching on Sky. The Roses, it seems, still captures the imagination. Durham, I’m afraid to report, have lost their first wicket on their quest to make large number of runs to win. Cameron Bancroft bowled by Jamie Porter for four. Durham 9-1. Tim Bresnan pockets Joe Clarke for 61 as Nottinghamshire reach 218-5. Danny Lamb (23 not out) is not the only member of his family batting today, his sister Emma is 55 not out for Thunder against Western Storm. Essex’s innings has disintegrated with a familiar flow: another bowled and another lbw, both to Ben Raine, who finishes with 5-64. Durham need 385 to win, with five and a half sessions to get them. Aha. Some amazing live stream data: on day one of the Roses match, Lancashire picked up 159,000 hits, and 153,000 on day two. This is compared with an average of 150,000 over a four day match. Plus more watching on Sky. The Roses, it seems, still captures the imagination. And a gorgeous straight drive from Bohannon off Olivier, pushes Lancashire towards 400. Bohannon’s fifty came at last - 149 balls, seven fours, 1 six - he’s a real block or biff it boy. And I should probably mention, for those of you not watching the live streams, that the players are still taking regular sanitisation breaks. Notts have just lost their first wicket,Lyndon James for four, and Joe Clarke has passed his fourth fifty of the season. Notts 202-4. Here, we’re still waiting for Josh Bohannon to get the two runs to reach his fifty. Voices in the press box saying: “Bohannon for England!” A slow start here, a bit of prodding and poking with a fair scattering of members on an almost humid day. Some cracking reads in the paper today: and one that I KNOW will appeal to County Blog readers: Good morning! It’s the last Saturday in May and county cricket is in bloom everywhere. Some tight games today, results could flourish at Hove and Chester-le-Street ,while Lancashire, Surrey and Middlesex will tighten the screw. Keep an eye too on the Rachael Heyhoe Flint Trophy, which starts today. This year, its second, consists of eight-teams (Central Sparks, South East Stars, Northern Diamonds, Western Storm, Sunrisers , Thunder, Southern Vipers and Loughborough Lightening) playing in a 50-over competition. Lastly, apologies for the slight delay to the blog - the dog rolled in something disgusting. Group One Riverside: Durham 99 all out v Essex 182 all out and 263-8 Edgbaston: Warwickshire 341 all out v Nottinghamshire 173-3 New Road: Worcestershire 421 all out v Derbyshire 91-3 Group Two Grace Road: Leicestershire 136 v Middlesex 295 and 57-1 The Oval: Surrey 473 all out v Gloucestershire 45-1 Group Three Old Trafford: Lancashire 350-6 v Yorkshire 159 all out Hove: Sussex 175 all out and 142-4 v Northants 256 all out On a traditionally overcast Roses Friday, the day meandered towards a crushing Lancashire lead. Keaton Jennings was the master builder, crafting his first red-ball century since he made 146 not out for England against Sri Lanka in November 2018. After a couple of years in the wilderness, this season he has rediscovered both touch and brio. Away he chugged, putting on 19 runs in the first 45 minutes with Luke Wells, but there were occasional boulders as well as bricks, as skimming cover drives and gleaming late cuts were plucked from the level. Yorkshire plugged away, throwing on Dom Bess, his baggy trousers and shaggy hair a sharp contrast to Jennings’ ironed creases and buttoned cuffs. Yorkshire eventually got their hands on the new ball they had been after all day, and it tookonly five overs to make a breakthrough as Jennings was caught at first slip after a partnership of 175 with Wells. One became three as Wells, then Livingstone followed. But on Lancashire went. For a while it seemed they would try for maximum batting bonus points as Dane Vilas straight drove Steven Patterson for four, then dropped to one knee and pulled him behind square, and Bess was biffed for straight sixes, with Josh Bohannon reaching the scorers’ box high in the media centre. But sense soon prevailed and the grind, grind, grind returned. A sixth wicket stand of 125 between Ryan ten Doeschate (55) and Adam Wheater (81) rescued Essex from an unbecoming 53 for five to finish the day with a towering lead at Chester-le-Street. Durham were earlier bowled out for 99; such was the haste of their demise that Simon Harmer didn’t even get to wrap his bowling fingers around the ball. Saif Zaib’s 64 helped Northants to a handy first-innings lead at Hove. After a post-tea wobble, Tom Haines and Ben Brown inched Sussex ahead. Lewis Hill and Callum Parkinson were the only players to make their mark on Leicestershire’s first innings of 136. Martin Andersson was too much for their middle order, picking up four for 27, his best figures for Middlesex. Hashim Amla continued to scatter his munificence at The Oval, finishing with 173, and Surrey 473, thanks to a bit of hurry-up from Rikki Clarke and Sean Abbott. Gloucestershire must now bat out two days on a turning pitch, with Amar Virdi already in the wickets shortly before rain stopped play. A last wicket can-can of 52 for Warwickshire between Liam Norwell and Oliver Hannon-Dalby proved a morning irritation to Nottinghamshire on a day interrupted by showers. Norwell, who had frying-panned three sixes, then nipped in to remove England-bound Haseeb Hameed for 39, Ben Duckett and, later, Ben Slater for 77. Ed Barnard coaxed the tail into a morning wag with another handy innings, this time of 90, as Worcestershire reached 421. On a rain-interrupted afternoon, Derbyshire lost three wickets.","charCount":"9932","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/tanyaaldred\">Tanya Aldred</a> at Old Trafford"},{"headline":"Gwenifer Raymond review – finger-picking good","standfirst":"<p><strong>Islington Assembly Hall, London<br></strong>The Welsh guitarist’s awe-inspiring technique and intense musicality made a transporting first gig back for our critic</p>","trailText":"The Welsh guitarist dazzles with awe-inspiring technique and her intense musicality","byline":"Kitty Empire","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"163cc7af8d0b15930b695da3c7448d70fcc64fca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/163cc7af8d0b15930b695da3c7448d70fcc64fca/0_371_6719_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gwenifer Raymond performing at Islington Assembly Hall, London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Like a vengeful bluegrass musician conjuring up roiling fury’: Gwenifer Raymond at Islington Assembly Hall, London. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Barefoot, wearing all black, a solitary guitarist sits on the stage, her face shrouded by a curtain of long hair, her hands a blur of motion.

Mysie initially released music under her real name, Lizbet Sempa, but has said in interviews that she quickly felt pigeonholed and exhausted by industry expectations of the kind of music that black women might make. And so the project was reborn with a new moniker – a nod to her middle name, Margaery. Last year, Mysie won the inaugural Ivor Novello Rising Star award. Fraser T Smith, the producer best known for his work with Adele, Stormzy and Dave, has become a mentor of sorts, and has exec-produced Mysie’s second EP, Undertones. A polished set of songs about love and possibilities that marries her glossy vocals with percussion and sweet, clipped guitars, it builds on an already impressively assured back catalogue. Undertones is out now on 70Hz Recordings","charCount":"1338","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"true","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/tara-joshi\">Tara Joshi</a>"},{"headline":"Tall orders for Kyle Jamieson and Ollie Robinson lend Test series an edge ","standfirst":"<p>Bigger battles ahead for England and New Zealand but clash of monster bowlers will entertain Lord’s and Edgbaston crowds</p>","trailText":"Bigger battles ahead for England and New Zealand but clash of monster bowlers will entertain Lord’s and Edgbaston crowds","byline":"Ali Martin","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c5e85332b4ff1a7258f1e0b44e4b6420b44619d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5e85332b4ff1a7258f1e0b44e4b6420b44619d0/0_90_5534_3599/1000.jpg\" alt=\"New Zealand’s Kyle Jamieson is 6ft 8in and has a mean bouncer at his disposal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"650\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New Zealand’s Kyle Jamieson is 6ft 8in and has a mean bouncer at his disposal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marty Melville/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>It took 48 years and 48 attempts for New Zealand to taste their first Test victory against England – Richard Hadlee inspiring this slice of history at windy Wellington in 1978 – but when the two sides meet at Lord’s next week it will be the visitors who do so from a position of relative superiority.</p> <p>There will be inevitable references to the last time the two countries locked horns in NW8 – shut your eyes and you can still hear Ian Smith’s commentary at the end of that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/14/england-new-zealand-cricket-world-cup-final-match-report-super-over\" title=\"\">heart-stopping World Cup final in 2019</a> .

<p>Officials have tested more than 36,000 inmates in recent weeks and begun delivering Covid vaccines to inmates and prison staff.</p> <p>Somsak said he was examining ways to give early releases to

NHS England said that, since it began opening up the vaccine rollout to this age group on 13 May, about 53% of those aged 30 to 39 have been given at least one dose. Overall, more than 32 million people have been vaccinated with a first dose in England, almost three-quarters of the total adult population, while more than 20 million people have had both doses. People aged 30 to 31 were from Wednesday invited to get their jab, with more than 5m appointments made through the national booking service within 72 hours. The data comes as the NHS is asking people aged 50 and over, as well as those who are clinically vulnerable, to bring forward their second Covid-19 vaccination to help combat the spread of the B1.617.2 variant first identified in India. It follows the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) recommending earlier this month that the second dose interval be shortened from 12 weeks to eight for people in priority cohorts. NHS England said so far 600,000 people have been invited to rearrange their second jab through the national booking service, with around a quarter moving their appointment earlier. NHS England chief executive, Sir Simon Stevens, said: It is remarkable that, in little over two weeks since people in their 30s began getting their invites, more than half have now had their first dose. This success is no happy accident but the result of months of careful planning and the sheer hard work and dedication of NHS staff. The Covid-19 vaccine is our most effective weapon against coronavirus and the best way of protecting yourself and loved ones, so, if you do one thing this bank holiday weekend, book your lifesaving jab and, crucially, if you’re contacted by the NHS to do so, bring forward your second dose of vital protection. Health secretary, Matt Hancock, said he was “absolutely thrilled” at the progress in the 30s age group and thanked those coming forward “to do their bit to defeat the virus”. He said: As we enjoy the reopening of pubs and restaurants again, vaccines will play a crucial role in protecting us and those around us. Vaccines are the best way out of this pandemic and I urge everybody to take up the offer when eligible. The Duchess of Cambridge has been given her first dose of a coronavirus vaccine. A message from the 39-year-old on the Kensington Palace Twitter account said: “Yesterday I received my first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine at London’s Science Museum. “I’m hugely grateful to everyone who is playing a part in the rollout – thank you for everything you are doing.” I’m Jedidajah Otte and will be taking back over now for the next few hours.

Launching a programme of Covid-19 immunisations for children should be considered only in special circumstances, leading health experts have warned. Offering vaccines to children – who “rarely suffer badly from the disease themselves” – could raise important practical and ethical problems, they said. Meanwhile, the head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also urged countries to reconsider vaccinating children when lower-income countries do not have enough doses to immunise vulnerable populations. In contrast, Klaus Okkenhaug, professor of immunology in the department of pathology at the University of Cambridge, said this morning that “it would of course help for children to be vaccinated because it also reduces their opportunities to transmit this virus to their teachers”. He added that although it was “a little bit of a fine balance because they are so unlikely to be affected by the virus”, he believes there’s “a good argument” for vaccinating over-12s, given the “phenomenal safety records” of some available vaccines. The organiser of the Edinburgh Fringe has said the world’s largest arts festival is “in danger” if the Scottish government does not ease social distancing rules for venues within a fortnight. Shona McCarthy, chief executive of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe Society, called on ministers to replace the current two-metre rule with the one-metre rule used in hospitality in order to help secure the future of the 75-year-old festival. McCarthy told the Times Scotland: “Within another two weeks, it’s going to be impossible for any [Edinburgh promoter] to put on anything. “There’s a real danger for the future of the Fringe. One year of no festival was manageable, and we were able to keep it in hearts and minds and everybody still held that space in their calendar, as that annual moment for reconnection and getting together. At two years, you jeopardise the solid space the Fringe has held for 75 years.” She urged the government to “have that leap of faith” and trust venues to deliver services safely in the same way as the hospitality sector. The UK government appears to have abandoned its “data not dates” principle, an expert advising its coronavirus response has warned, adding that its reluctance to delay unlocking was leading to “contradictory” messaging. Prof Stephen Reicher, a psychologist on the Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours (Spi-B), joined scientists warning against the final lifting of restrictions on 21 June as cases passed 4,000 for the first time since late March on Friday. Reicher said the government had invested “so much political capital” in particular dates that it has become difficult to diverge from them if the data suggests it is necessary. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I think we are in a pickle of the government’s own making at the moment. I think the reason for that is it has departed from its own mantra of ‘data not dates’. Very quickly ‘data not dates’ became ‘dates not data’.” Hello, this is Clea Skopeliti taking over the blog for the next hour while Jedidajah has a break.

Indonesia will introduce a “Work From Bali” programme for civil servants aimed at helping to revive the island’s battered economy. Bloomberg reports: The coordinating ministry for maritime and investment affairs will start with a pilot project in Nusa Dua, once a prime location for major conferences including the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in 2013, to encourage more meetings and outbound activities on the island. “We hope that with the arrival of government and state-owned company employees, the gears of Bali’s economy will start moving,” Hermin Esti Setyowati, an assistant deputy at the ministry, said in a statement on Saturday. Tourism-reliant Bali has been among the country’s hardest-hit provinces as borders remain shut, leaving its hotels and beaches empty. Its GDP shrank 9.9% in the first quarter from a year ago, following a 9.3% contraction for all of 2020. The island welcomed just 25 foreigners from January to March, compared with 1.1 million in the same period last year. The local government plans to accelerate its vaccination program with a goal of reaching herd immunity against Covid-19 by July, which could allow the island to reopen to international tourists. There is a “good argument” for vaccinating older children against Covid-19 given the safety records of some Covid vaccines, an expert has said. Klaus Okkenhaug, professor of immunology in the department of pathology at the University of Cambridge, told Times Radio that the decision on whether to give children coronavirus jabs was a “difficult question” that requires balancing wider benefits against the direct ones for children. He said: I think for a whole population it would of course help for children to be vaccinated because it also reduces their opportunities to transmit this virus to their teachers. Prof Okkenhaug said that when considering the “direct benefits to the children” it was “a little bit of a fine balance because they are so unlikely to be affected by the virus”. He added: But I think given the phenomenal safety records of some of the vaccines out there, there’s a good argument for going ahead at least with older children, say 12 and above. A coronavirus surge sweeping through Thailand’s prisons has thrown the spotlight on the kingdom’s overcrowded penal system, where some inmates have less space to sleep than the inside of a coffin. AFP reports: More than 22,000 people have tested positive inside jails, where inmates living cheek by jowl have been encouraged to keep wearing their masks even while they sleep. Authorities have floated plans to give early releases to prisoners with underlying medical conditions and have announced funding for more testing and medical care in recent days. But those behind bars say they have been kept in the dark about the seriousness of the outbreak. “Prisoners don’t have the knowledge to protect themselves,” said Somyot Prueksakasemsuk, a high-profile activist facing charges under Thailand’s harsh royal defamation law. Somyot was bailed last month and told AFP that he had not been tested for Covid-19 once during his 10-week stint in custody. He was not worried about contracting the disease while in jail because he had no idea about the level of risk. “But after this I’m so scared [for everyone still inside] ... if you are inside the prison you are at risk, it’s unavoidable,” he said. Thailand’s prison outbreak has skyrocketed from just 10 publicly announced cases a month ago and sparked growing public concern after a handful of prominent activists contracted the illness. Among them was student leader Panusaya “Rung” Sithijirawattanakul, who helped lead a series of rallies last year demanding political reforms in the kingdom, and who tested positive after she was released on bail. The Thai prison population stood at around 311,000 earlier this year, the International Federation for Human Rights said – more than two and a half times the system’s official capacity. Four inmates in every five are serving time for drug charges because of harsh anti-narcotics laws that can see offenders jailed for a decade for possessing just a few methamphetamine pills. Many cells are so packed with bodies that some inmates only have half a metre (less than 2ft) of space. “That is less room for a body than the inside of a coffin,” justice minister Somsak Thepsutin told local media in February. Officials have tested more than 36,000 inmates in recent weeks and begun delivering Covid vaccines to inmates and prison staff. Somsak said he was examining ways to give early releases to prisoners with underlying medical conditions, possibly through a royal pardon. Even if the plan goes ahead, prisoners will still have to complete a quarantine before returning home. India has recorded the lowest number of new daily infections in 45 days, the Times of India reports, although a further 173,790 fresh cases were logged in the country on Saturday. The official death toll climbed to 322,512 as a further 3,617 Covid fatalities recorded on Saturday, according to health ministry data. Daily recoveries continue to outnumber the daily new cases for the 16th consecutive day. A total of 2,080,048 samples were tested in the last 24 hours, according to the Indian Council of Medical Research. The governing civic body of Mumbai on Friday allowed walk-in vaccination for students who have been accepted for university courses abroad and require immunisation to travel. France’s budget deficit for 2021 will stand at €220bn, some €47bn higher than previously estimated, Olivier Dussopt, the public accounts minister, told AFP on Saturday. The increase is “a result of supporting measures that we’re continuing to take to support the recovery” from the devastating effects that Covid-19 shutdowns wreaked on the eurozone’s second-largest economy, he said. It is not yet clear how the revised numbers will affect the budget deficit when expressed as percentage of GDP, which was previously forecast to hit 9% this year, a postwar record. Public debt was previously forecast to reach 118% of GDP. The Covid-19 pandemic is expected to cost the French state nearly half a trillion euros over three years - €158bn in 2020, an expected €171bn in 2021 and a forecast €96bn in 2022, Dussopt said in April. France has borrowed heavily to try to keep the economy afloat through three nationwide lockdowns, including money spent on supporting salaries of people furloughed and aid for companies struggling to stay afloat during the crisis. The southern Chinese city of Guangzhou shut down a neighborhood and ordered its residents to stay home on Saturday for door-to-door coronavirus testing following an upsurge in infections. Guangzhou, a business and industrial centre of 15 million people north of Hong Hong, has reported 20 new infections over the past week. The number is small compared with India’s thousands of daily cases but has alarmed Chinese authorities who believed they had the virus under control. The spread of infections was “fast and strong,” the Global Times newspaper cited health authorities as saying. Saturday’s order to stay home applied to residents of five streets in Liwan district in the city centre. Outdoor markets, childcare centres and entertainment venues were closed. Indoor restaurant dining was prohibited, while grade schools were told to stop in-person tuition. People in parts of four nearby districts were ordered to limit outdoor activity. The city government earlier ordered testing of hundreds of thousands of residents following the initial infections. The government said some 700,000 people had been tested by Wednesday. China reports a handful of new cases every day but says almost all are believed to be people who were infected abroad, the Associated Press reports. The mainland’s official death toll stands at 4,636 out of 91,061 confirmed cases. On Saturday, the National Health Commission reported two new locally transmitted cases in Guangzhou and 14 in other parts of the country that it said came from abroad. Most of the latest infections in Guangzhou are believed to be linked to a 75-year-old woman who was found on 21 May to have the variant first identified in India, state media say. Most of the others attended a dinner with her or live together. That infection spread to the nearby city of Nanshan, where one new confirmed case and two asymptomatic cases were reported Saturday after people from Guangzhou were tested, according to the Global Times. Infections in Germany continue on a downward trend, according to the country’s Robert Koch Institute (RKI), with health authorities having reported 5,426 new cases within one day to the institute, down from 6,419 a week earlier. The seven-day incidence on Saturday morning stood at 37.5 nationwide, down from 39.8 on Friday and 66.8 in the previous week. Public holidays have, however, resulted in fewer people seeing a doctor, which means fewer samples are taken and fewer laboratory tests. Therefore, fewer new infections are reported. According to the RKI, 163 new deaths were recorded across Germany within 24 hours. A week ago 170 deaths from the virus were logged. The RKI has counted 3,675,296 Covid-19 infections since the beginning of the pandemic, but the actual total number is likely significantly higher, since many infections are not detected. The Philippines said on Saturday people were allowed to again go to work in Saudi Arabia, reversing a brief deployment ban after the kingdom said they would not be charged for Covid-19 tests and quarantine upon arrival. Reuters reports: “Our Saudi-bound workers will no longer be disadvantaged,” said labour secretary, Silvestre Bello. Flag carrier Philippine Airlines said it would accept Filipino workers on flights to Dammam and Riyadh, waiving rebooking fees for passengers who had been unable to board because of the deployment ban. Bello apologised for the “inconvenience and momentary anguish” caused by his Thursday ban, saying: “I understand that the suspension order drew confusion and irritation among our affected departing overseas Filipino workers.” More than a million Filipinos work in Saudi Arabia, the most preferred destination of overseas Filipino workers in 2019, government data shows. Many Filipinos are hired as construction workers, domestic helpers or nurses. In 2020, Filipinos in Saudi Arabia sent home $1.8bn in remittances, a key support for the consumption-led economy. With more than 1.2 million cases and 20,722 deaths, the Philippines has the second-highest Covid-19 infections and casualties in south-east Asia, behind Indonesia. People should be “very concerned” about the spread of the Indian variant of coronavirus, but “reassured” by the scale of the vaccine rollout, an expert has said. Professor Anthony Harnden, deputy chair of the UK’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), told BBC Breakfast that the variant was “clearly more transmissible”. He said: We need to be reassured that we’re in a very different position now in that we’ve got a highly vaccinated population and we just need to continue moving at speed. We do know that with this particular variant you do need two doses to offer complete protection, and so we’re very, very keen to make sure that all those, particularly higher risk groups, that’s the over-50s and those with underlying illness, receive their second vaccination as soon as feasible. The unlocking of society in England will be a “gradual process” that requires a “cautious” approach even if the government’s target date for removing all legal limits on social contact in the country on 21 June remains in place, he added, emphasising the need to “look very carefully” at what happens with the India variant in the next one or two weeks. He said: I think we need to look at that data very carefully before we completely un-lockdown. He suggested it was “better” to be on “the cautious side”, adding: Even if we do un-lockdown, if you are in a vulnerable position, particularly if you’ve not been vaccinated, you do need to carry on being cautious, even if the 21 June date goes ahead. So I think we’ve all got used to living within boundaries at the moment and I think it’s not an all or none, I think it will be a gradual process even if the 21 June date goes ahead. Scotland’s health secretary Humza Yousaf said there was “significant community transmission” of coronavirus in hotspots in the city of Glasgow. The city will remain under level 3 of Scotland’s restrictions until at least 5 June and Yousaf said urgent work was being carried out to understand the outbreak in south Glasgow and how the India variant arrived. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today: In a few concentrated hotspots ... we are seeing significant community transmission. The levels and the numbers of cases are continuing to rise. In other parts of the country “local health teams tell us they are relatively contained outbreaks” linked to either schools or domestic clusters, but that was not the case in Glasgow. What we are seeing is it’s coming in in areas where there is a large, diverse community so therefore there is a probability the variant has come in from international travel. Therefore we are trying to get to the bottom of how it managed to get in. Victoria state in Australia has recorded five new locally acquired cases of coronavirus, with four linked to a food distribution delivery driver, as the state enters its second day of its fourth lockdown. The update brings the total number of cases from the latest outbreak in Melbourne to 35. A record 56,624 tests were conducted in the 24 hours to Saturday morning, surpassing the previous day’s record of 47,462 tests. On Saturday, the state’s Covid testing commander, Jeroen Weimar, said four of the new cases were linked to a person who tested positive on Friday. The Victorian health minister, Martin Foley, said the person was a food distribution delivery driver who visited “multiple stores and grocery sites across metropolitan Melbourne on 18 and 19 May”. There are now more than 150 exposure sites and more than 15,000 primary and secondary contacts who must self-isolate after coming into potential contact with a person with Covid-19. Foley said the individual “worked during their infectious period” but they “showed no signs of Covid symptoms themselves”. He also thanked the food distribution company and customers for working with contact tracers. Weimar said four of the new cases announced on Saturday were household contacts of the delivery driver, including a student at Mount Ridley college in Craigieburn. He said these four people had only been in isolation for one day. The fifth case was separate, and was an employee of firm Stratton Finance who became infected at a display home in Mickleham. Late on Friday the Victorian health department announced new tier 1 exposure sites – where people are most at risk of catching and spreading the virus. A full list of exposure sites can be found here. Foley announced what he called a “hat-trick of records”, as the state administered a record number of tests and vaccinations over the past three days. Taiwan reported 486 new domestic Covid-19 cases on Saturday, including 166 cases added to the totals for recent days as it continues to readjust its infection numbers following delays in reporting positive tests. After successfully keeping coronavirus at bay, Taiwan is currently in the grip of its first serious outbreak. The island is desperately seeking vaccines to protect its people, and Taiwan’s neighbour China has offered to help, the BBC reported. Up until the mid-May, the country had logged only around 1,500 infections and 12 deaths, before cases began to rise sharply. On Tuesday, health minister Chen Shih-chung announced 2m vaccine doses would arrive in Taiwan in June, and 10m by the end of August. Russia reported 9,289 new Covid-19 cases on Saturday, including 3,241 in Moscow, taking the official national tally since the pandemic began to 5,053,748. The government coronavirus task force said 401 people had died of coronavirus-linked causes in the past 24 hours, pushing the national death toll to 120,807. The federal statistics agency has kept a separate count and has said Russia recorded around 250,000 deaths related to Covid-19 from April 2020 to March 2021. Malaysia reported 9,020 new coronavirus cases on Saturday, the highest daily toll since the start of the pandemic. This is the fifth straight day of record new infections, bringing the total number of cases in the country to 558,534. The country’s prime minister, Muhyiddin Yassin, has announced a nationwide “total lockdown” from 1 to 14 June that will apply to all social and economic areas, with only essential services and economic sectors listed by the national security council remaining in operation, ABC reports. “With the latest rise in daily cases showing a drastically upward trend, hospital capacity across the country to treat Covid-19 patients are becoming limited,” Muhyiddin said in a statement. Prof Stephen Reicher, a psychologist on the UK’s Sage sub-committee advising the government on behavioural science, said “confusion” over the government’s approach was undermining efforts to control the pandemic. Ahead of the planned 21 June easing of restrictions in England, he said the government was in a “pickle” because it appeared to have abandoned the “data, not dates” principle. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today: The data we are seeing at the moment suggests we have a problem. We don’t know how big the problem is - it might be bad, it might be very bad, we will learn in the next week or two. But the problem for the government is: on the one hand it can’t delay what it has been promising for so long, but on the other hand it is aware of the dangers of so doing. And so you see that in the fact that they are beginning to act in a rather contradictory way. They’re saying to us, for instance on travel: ‘you can travel internationally but please don’t’. They say of social contact ‘you can hug, but please don’t hug’. They say of restrictions, ‘no restrictions but please don’t go in and out of the hotspots’. That contradiction, that sense of confusion, I think is undermining the response. Hello and welcome to our global coronavirus live blog. Vietnam health minister Nguyen Thanh Long said on Saturday the country has detected a new variant of the coronavirus, which is a mix of the India and UK Covid-19 variants and spreads quickly by air, online newspaper VnExpress reported. Vietnam’s latest coronavirus wave, which began about a month ago, has seen 3,595 local Covid-19 cases so far in 33 cities and provinces. He said the coronavirus responsible for the new wave is much more transmissible, especially in the air. Viral cultures in the laboratory revealed that the virus replicated itself very quickly, he added, explaining why there are so many new cases in different locations in a shorter time frame. So far, Vietnam has recorded the presence of seven coronavirus variants, including ones from the UK, India and South Africa.

Caution is needed in determining whether England’s coronavirus restrictions can be lifted next month or “things will get bad very, very quickly”, a professor whose argument against herd immunity helped trigger the first lockdown has warned. Sir Tim Gowers, a professor of mathematics at the University of Cambridge, told the Guardian the downside of being “a bit more cautious” was a lot smaller than the downside of getting it wrong, as UK Covid cases rose by 4,184 on Friday – the highest increase since 1 April. Asked about the next step in lockdown easing in England, due on June 21, Prof Gowers said he did not believe the plans were necessarily at risk, but urged caution. He said: Because Boris Johnson has made a big thing about all the steps being irreversible, I think he’s put himself in a position where once he takes a step, he’ll be extremely reluctant to reverse because that would be a big U-turn, an embarrassing climbdown. So I think if that’s the way you’re going to play things, then you should be very, very cautious about every step you take ... And maybe everything [will] be OK, maybe the number of people who are vaccinated will be just enough ... ‘R’ will broadly speaking stay below one even with Indian variants. But if it’s not OK, we know, because of mathematics, that things will get bad very, very quickly. Or at least, maybe it won’t look that quick to start with, but it’ll grow exponentially. So it’ll pick up speed and become a big problem. Read my colleague Ben Quinn’s full story here. Prof Christina Pagel, a member of Independent Sage from University College London, said reopening should be delayed a few more months.","charCount":"26995","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/jedidajah-otte\">Jedidajah Otte</a> (now), <a href=\"profile/clea-skopeliti\">Clea Skopeliti</a> (earlier)"},{"headline":"Jam sponge and cheesy flatbread: Ravneet Gill’s recipes for young bakers","standfirst":"<p>Little hands will have lots of fun with this school dinner sponge cake and simple savoury flatbread</p>","trailText":"Little hands will have lots of fun with this school dinner sponge cake and simple savoury flatbread","byline":"Ravneet Gill","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"23edadbaec357e2b07d1412a81ea8072c889e057\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23edadbaec357e2b07d1412a81ea8072c889e057/0_565_3761_4860/774.jpg\" alt=\"Ravneet Gill’s vanilla sponge with jam and coconut.\" width=\"774\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ravneet Gill’s vanilla sponge with jam and coconut.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kim Lightbody/The Guardian.

That made a big difference to his career at the time, Oakley said. “Some of his work was regarded as quite scandalous and quite difficult to show in public. Without Charlotte, I don’t think he would have been as successful as he was, and he would have had to struggle a lot more.”</p> <p>Yet her role has been relegated by biographers in the past to that of a secretary – despite the fact that Shaw actually employed a secretary to do all his secretarial work. “The way her contribution is written about is: she was his wife, so she was typing his manuscripts. They don’t give her any intellectual credit, when a lot of this work is actually collaborative.”</p> <p>The play <em>Saint Joan</em>, for example, was her idea, Oakley said. “That’s commonly known to Shaw’s biographers. But – and I have to say it’s male biographers and historians – they simply do not consider that anything Charlotte did could have been all that important, so they don’t actually take on board the evidence that’s right in front of them.”</p> <p>For example, in his book about his friendship with George Bernard Shaw, the playwright Lawrence Langner gave an account of a visit he made to the Shaws in 1922, during which he asked them whether there were any new plays in the offing. “The trouble is, we haven’t been able to find a good subject,” Charlotte replied. He wrote: “I must have looked astonished, for she continued, ‘Yes, I sometimes find ideas for plays for the Genius [meaning Shaw]. If we can find a good subject for a play, he usually writes it very quickly.”</p> <p>Most of the time, however, Charlotte did not take any credit for the help she gave Shaw. “She was very modest,” said Oakley. “I suspect that she didn’t want people to know how important she was to George Bernard Shaw’s work, because then they might have thought less of him.”</p> <p>As a result, the extraordinary role she played in Shaw’s life has been continually overlooked, Oakley said: “It’s the patriarchy, I’m afraid. Charlotte is one of very many women whose lives have been treated disrespectfully, because they were married to great men and it was assumed they weren’t doing anything important.”</p> <p>It is for this reason, Oakley argues, that Charlotte’s own independent intellectual work has been largely forgotten or attributed to Shaw. For example, she translated the plays of Eugène Brieux – “Shaw’s French equivalent” – into English for the first time, an achievement usually credited to Shaw.</p> <p>She was also a founder of the London School of Economics (LSE). “She rented the building where the LSE started out, and paid for a lot of the early teaching and research work,” said Oakley. “She endowed a programme of research into women’s history, which was really the first time anyone in Britain had ever seriously researched what went on in women’s lives before the industrial revolution.” Yet the Shaw Library, which is named after her, is usually assumed to be named for her husband.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/apr/30/george-bernard-shaw-reinvention-shakespeare-chekhov\">How TV fell out of love with George Bernard Shaw</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She also worked on the manuscript of <em>Seven Pillars of Wisdom</em> by TE Lawrence – better known as Lawrence of Arabia – for years, encouraging him in letters and suggesting edits and revisions. “She had this extraordinarily close intellectual relationship with Lawrence, which you can see from the correspondence.

But – and I have to say it’s male biographers and historians – they simply do not consider that anything Charlotte did could have been all that important, so they don’t actually take on board the evidence that’s right in front of them.” For example, in his book about his friendship with George Bernard Shaw, the playwright Lawrence Langner gave an account of a visit he made to the Shaws in 1922, during which he asked them whether there were any new plays in the offing. “The trouble is, we haven’t been able to find a good subject,” Charlotte replied. He wrote: “I must have looked astonished, for she continued, ‘Yes, I sometimes find ideas for plays for the Genius [meaning Shaw]. If we can find a good subject for a play, he usually writes it very quickly.” Most of the time, however, Charlotte did not take any credit for the help she gave Shaw. “She was very modest,” said Oakley. “I suspect that she didn’t want people to know how important she was to George Bernard Shaw’s work, because then they might have thought less of him.” As a result, the extraordinary role she played in Shaw’s life has been continually overlooked, Oakley said: “It’s the patriarchy, I’m afraid. Charlotte is one of very many women whose lives have been treated disrespectfully, because they were married to great men and it was assumed they weren’t doing anything important.” It is for this reason, Oakley argues, that Charlotte’s own independent intellectual work has been largely forgotten or attributed to Shaw. For example, she translated the plays of Eugène Brieux – “Shaw’s French equivalent” – into English for the first time, an achievement usually credited to Shaw. She was also a founder of the London School of Economics (LSE). “She rented the building where the LSE started out, and paid for a lot of the early teaching and research work,” said Oakley. “She endowed a programme of research into women’s history, which was really the first time anyone in Britain had ever seriously researched what went on in women’s lives before the industrial revolution.” Yet the Shaw Library, which is named after her, is usually assumed to be named for her husband. She also worked on the manuscript of Seven Pillars of Wisdom by TE Lawrence – better known as Lawrence of Arabia – for years, encouraging him in letters and suggesting edits and revisions. “She had this extraordinarily close intellectual relationship with Lawrence, which you can see from the correspondence. There is evidence she had a massive impact on Lawrence’s writings and was essential to the success of his work, but again people have assumed she played some kind of minor role – that she was correcting his punctuation or passing on the comments that George Bernard Shaw had made.” In fact, George Bernard Shaw only discovered her correspondence with Lawrence after she died. Lawrence wrote to her admiringly about her writing abilities, hinting that he had guessed how much help she gave Shaw with his work: “You can write the plays by yourself ... or parts of them. Don’t imagine that by this I really mean that George isn’t a colossus, and us little mortals: but how often you hold his hand.”","charCount":"5911","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/donna-ferguson\">Donna Ferguson</a>"},{"headline":"Teenager in court charged with conspiracy to murder Sasha Johnson","standfirst":"<p>Cameron Deriggs, 18, appeared at Westminster magistrates court over shooting of Black Lives Matter activist</p>","trailText":"Cameron Deriggs, 18, appeared at Westminster magistrates court over shooting of Black Lives Matter activist","byline":"Clea Skopeliti","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6ccfc4526b8fecc1f817dd173339a7f150d3cee4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ccfc4526b8fecc1f817dd173339a7f150d3cee4/0_36_2058_1235/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sasha Johnson was a leading figure in last summer’s anti-racism protests.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sasha Johnson was a leading figure in last summer’s anti-racism protests.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA Video/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>An 18-year-old man has appeared in court charged with conspiracy to murder in relation to the shooting of the Black Lives Matter activist Sasha Johnson.</p> <p>Johnson, 27, was shot at a house party in Peckham, south-east London, in the early hours of Sunday and remains in a critical condition in hospital.</p> <p>Cameron Deriggs, from Lewisham, south London, appeared at Westminster magistrates court on Saturday morning after being charged on Friday night.</p> <p>He was one of five males arrested on Wednesday in connection with the incident.

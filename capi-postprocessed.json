Let’s learn a little more about the two players involved.</p> <p><strong>Tamara Zidansek</strong> is the world No 85, and the true outsider of the four. The Slovenian had never been past the second round at a slam before this run, which began with a first-round comeback win over the No 6 seed, Bianca Andreescu. Zidansek has played in and lost two WTA Tour finals, both on clay, most recently in Colombia last month.</p> <p>Her opponent, <strong>Paula Badosa</strong>, was promoted to No 33 seed when Alison Riske withdrew. The former junior French Open champion is a rising star on clay, beating Sloane Stephens and Jelena Ostapenko on a run to the fourth round here in 2020. While her path to the quarters was eased by Naomi Osaka’s withdrawal, the Spaniard still had to overcome former finalist Marketa Vondrousova to reach the last eight.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60be94538f0837b8708e089f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-08T09:38:08.183Z\">10.38am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The quarter-finals begin at Roland Garros and while the biggest names feature later today or tomorrow, we start with a fascinating four-way battle to reach new heights. In the bottom half of the women’s draw, four players remain: Slovenia’s Tamara Zidansek, Spain’s Paula Badosa, Kazakhstan’s Elena Rybakina and her Russian doubles partner, Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. </p> <p>Of the quartet, only Pavlyuchenkova has reached a grand slam quarter-final before, and now one of them will be in the final on Saturday. Experience arguably makes Pavlyuchenkova the favourite but in truth, all four women will fancy their chances. Zidansek and Badosa are first up on Court Philippe-Chatrier.</p> <p>Later on, Alexander Zverev looks to continue his impressive form against the only man outside the top 10 seeds to reach the quarters: Spanish youngster Alejandro Davidovich Fokina. In the evening session Stefanos Tsitsipas takes on Daniil Medvedev, the No 2 seed who had never won a match here before this year.</p> </div>   </div>","wordcount":"1382","firstPublicationDate":"2021-06-08T09:40:59Z","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2021-06-08T11:26:56Z","liveBloggingNow":"true","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/p/hyg7v","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/27838b36800be54adb4d8138c6f1e97def3b1acb/0_240_4713_2829/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","isLive":"true","bodyText":"Second set: Zidansek 7-5, 4-3 Badosa* (*denotes next server) Tamara Zidansek is two games away now, but her struggles continue on first serve and some aggressive baseline play gets Badosa two break-back points.

Second set: *Zidansek 7-5, 1-1 Badosa (*denotes next server) A big game for Badosa, who has lost three games in a row and still seems distracted by the umpire’s call that started the run. She stops the losing run here, and we stay on serve. Second set: Zidansek 7-5, 1-0 Badosa* (*denotes next server) Zidansek was the better player in that first set, and continues to push Badosa around the court, securing the hold by stepping in behind her serve and wrongfooting her opponent. If you’re just joining us (I’ve always wanted to say that ...) it’s been a cracking match so far, with Zidansek bouncing back brilliantly after going a double-break down.

First set: *Zidansek 1-3 Badosa (*denotes next server) She’s finding it tough on her own serve, so Zidansek senses the need to get after her opponent. An aggressive return game pays off, bringing up three break points, and she only needs one as Badosa goes long.

Early days, though. First set: Zidansek 0-1 Badosa* (*denotes next server) Zidansek makes a nervy start on serve and presents Badosa with an early break point. She doesn’t take the first chance but a firm forehand sets up another, taken with a backhand down the line. The players are out and warming up on a sunny Court Philippe-Chatrier. Carlos Ramos is the umpire; you might remember him from the 2018 US Open final. In other news, it appears that due to some pretty widespread technical problems, you’re probably not able to read this blog just now. At last, a chance to try out some of my freestyle poetry ... The first women’s quarter-final gets under way shortly. Let’s learn a little more about the two players involved. Tamara Zidansek is the world No 85, and the true outsider of the four. The Slovenian had never been past the second round at a slam before this run, which began with a first-round comeback win over the No 6 seed, Bianca Andreescu. Zidansek has played in and lost two WTA Tour finals, both on clay, most recently in Colombia last month. Her opponent, Paula Badosa, was promoted to No 33 seed when Alison Riske withdrew. The former junior French Open champion is a rising star on clay, beating Sloane Stephens and Jelena Ostapenko on a run to the fourth round here in 2020. While her path to the quarters was eased by Naomi Osaka’s withdrawal, the Spaniard still had to overcome former finalist Marketa Vondrousova to reach the last eight. The quarter-finals begin at Roland Garros and while the biggest names feature later today or tomorrow, we start with a fascinating four-way battle to reach new heights. In the bottom half of the women’s draw, four players remain: Slovenia’s Tamara Zidansek, Spain’s Paula Badosa, Kazakhstan’s Elena Rybakina and her Russian doubles partner, Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. Of the quartet, only Pavlyuchenkova has reached a grand slam quarter-final before, and now one of them will be in the final on Saturday. Experience arguably makes Pavlyuchenkova the favourite but in truth, all four women will fancy their chances. Zidansek and Badosa are first up on Court Philippe-Chatrier. Later on, Alexander Zverev looks to continue his impressive form against the only man outside the top 10 seeds to reach the quarters: Spanish youngster Alejandro Davidovich Fokina. In the evening session Stefanos Tsitsipas takes on Daniil Medvedev, the No 2 seed who had never won a match here before this year.","charCount":"8158","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/niall-mcveigh\">Niall McVeigh</a>"},{"headline":"Brexit: Eustice attacks ‘nonsensical’ ban on selling sausages as row with EU over Northern Ireland protocol deepens – live","standfirst":"<p>Latest updates: minister suggests US might side with UK over the Northern Ireland protocol if issue is brought up at this week’s G7 summit</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/jun/08/stop-brexit-blame-game-northern-ireland-business-leaders-tell-uk-and-eu\">Stop Brexit ‘blame game’, Northern Ireland business leaders tell UK and EU</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus global updates – live</a></li></ul>","trailText":"Minister suggests US might side with UK over the Northern Ireland protocol if issue is brought up at this week’s G7 summit","byline":"Andrew Sparrow","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b57a47aaf89ec867f190025a334e1c318cb7e686\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b57a47aaf89ec867f190025a334e1c318cb7e686/0_400_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Waiting lorries in the container terminal in Belfast Port in May.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Waiting lorries in the container terminal in Belfast Port in May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Artur Widak/NurPhoto/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<div id=\"block-60bf530e8f0837b8708e10a4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-08T11:23:05.848Z\">12.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This is from<strong> Ian Jones</strong> from PA Media.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ian_a_jones/status/1402223232841883649\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Here&#39;s how the latest Covid-19 case rates for local areas compare with one month ago.<br><br>The rise in cases is still concentrated mostly in NW England and Scotland, though pockets of the rest of England are now recording an increase. <a href=\"https://t.co/5Wgzm7aTX8\">pic.twitter.com/5Wgzm7aTX8</a></p>&mdash; Ian Jones (@ian_a_jones) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ian_a_jones/status/1402223232841883649?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 8, 2021</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60bf4eee8f0837b8708e104b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-08T11:12:44.580Z\">12.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>John Campbell,</strong> the BBC’s economics and business editor for Northern Ireland, has posted a useful Twitter thread on what George Eustice was saying about the Northern Ireland protocol this morning.

John Campbell, the BBC’s economics and business editor for Northern Ireland, has posted a useful Twitter thread on what George Eustice was saying about the Northern Ireland protocol this morning. (See 9.21am.) He is surprised that Eustice only now seems to be speaking out about the sausage issue, and he says Eustice was wrong in what he said about the US. The new DUP leader, Edwin Poots, is set to name his new Stormont ministerial team as the party attempts to recover from a number of resignations, PA Media reports. PA says: Poots is meeting selected party members ahead of the announcements being made throughout Tuesday. The roles will be designate at this stage, with the appointments post-dated to take effect later. The current first minister, Arlene Foster, previously indicated that she will stand down when Poots names a new ministerial team. But Poots said Foster will remain as first minister to lead a British-Irish Council meeting in her home constituency of Fermanagh on Friday. It has been widely speculated that Lagan Valley MLA Paul Givan will be named as the new first minister designate. The new appointments come as the DUP has been left reeling by a number of resignations. The latest member to leave described the “mind-blowing arrogance” of some during a meeting to ratify the appointment of the new leader. These are from Dmitry Grozoubinski, a trade specialist and founder of the ExplainTrade consultancy, on the row between the UK and the EU over the Northern Ireland protocol. In interviews this morning, as well as talking about sausage trade wars with the EU, George Eustice, the environment secretary, also urged people to holiday at home this year because of Covid. He told Sky News: Our advice has been don’t travel unless it’s absolutely necessary. Obviously we had hoped, with these three categories that we had, we had hoped that situation would be improving in other parts of the world, that we’d be able to progressively add other countries to the green list. Sadly, that’s not the situation, we do have this new variant of concern first identified in India that is now cropping up in other countries, and we’ve just got to take a very cautious approach. Eustice said that he would be staying at home this year and that he had “no intention of travelling or going on a holiday abroad this summer”. In fact, although the government used to advise people against non-essential travel abroad, that guidance was changed on 17 May. Since then the government has not opposed people going on holiday to green list countries. But Eustice’s comments will nevertheless be seen as a sign that the green list is not expected to be widely opened up any time soon. Young people are increasingly confident about getting a Covid vaccine, Dr Nikki Kanani, director of primary care at NHS England, said this morning. She told BBC Breakfast: More than four in five 40 to 49-year-olds have had their first dose and two-thirds of 30 to 39-year-olds have already had theirs, and that is still going to increase, of course, as people come forward, so uptake remains high. We had additional polling over the weekend that shows that the confidence in the vaccine has increased by a fifth - by 20% - in those under-40s. On Thursday Matt Hancock, the health secretary, will give evidence to the Commons health and science committees, who are holding a joint inquiry into the government’s handling of the Covid crisis. Some of the questions will relate to the many and damning criticisms of Hancock made by Dominic Cummings, the former chief adviser to the prime minister, when he gave evidence to the inquiry last month. The MPs were particularly shocked by Cummings’ claim that Hancock had repeatedly lied about what his department was doing, and they asked Cummings to provide written evidence to back up his allegations. Jeremy Hunt, the health committee chair, told Times Radio this morning that Cummings has yet to submit that evidence. He said: Well, obviously, Dominic Cummings made some very serious allegations against [Hancock] in particular, saying that he lied repeatedly. So we will put those allegations to him, but we haven’t received the written evidence to back those claims up that we were expecting. But we’ll be putting all those allegations to [Hancock] to give him his rightful chance to respond. According to today’s Times splash (paywall), ministers are considering delaying by a fortnight the full lifting of Covid restrictions in England originally scheduled for 21 June after receiving a “fairly grim” briefing from scientists. The Times reports: Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, and Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, yesterday gave a briefing to ministers on the latest data that was described as “fairly grim”. They emphasised concerns about the rate of transmission of new strains of coronavirus, such as the Indian variant, and that vaccinations did not provide 100 per cent protection. Millions of Britons remain unvaccinated. One cabinet source said they expected a delay of “between two weeks and a month” but suggested that the political fallout was likely to be limited as long as the full reopening took place before the start of the school summer holidays late next month. Jeremy Hunt, the Conservative chair of the Commons health committee, told Sky News this morning that a two-week delay would be acceptable. He said: I think the most important thing is that, when we lift this lockdown or these restrictions, we want to know that it’s forever, that we can finally get our freedom back and it’s not going to change. If we had to wait a couple of extra weeks because that was the scientific advice, I think most people would say that’s reasonable. Only 1% of deaths registered in England and Wales in the week ending Friday 28 May involved coronavirus, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics. There were 95 deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate - out of 9,628 deaths in total. That is the lowest daily total since the first week of September. The total number of deaths for the last week of May was also 3.1% below the five-year average for deaths at this time of year. The dispute between the UK and the EU over the implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol will be thrashed out tomorrow at a meeting in London between Lord Frost, the Brexit minister, and Maroš Šefčovič, the European commission vice president. It’s the first meeting of the joint partnership council, set up to oversee the implementation of the EU-UK trade deal, combined with a meeting of the joint committee, set up to oversee the operation of the Northern Ireland protocol. In an article for the Daily Telegraph, Šefčovič suggests that the EU is finding it hard to trust the UK because of the government’s decision earlier this year to unilaterally delay implementing aspects of the deal. He says there have been “numerous and fundamental gaps in the UK’s implementation”, and he starts his article: The prolific English hymn composer Isaac Watts once said: “Learning to trust is one of life’s most difficult tasks.” And yet it is also one of the most important tasks when it comes to building a productive, enduring and mutually beneficial partnership. As I travel to London today, it is clear that this week will be a defining one for consolidating trust between the European Union and the United Kingdom. And in a comment that led to the Telegraph writing up the story under the headline “Europe threatens sausage trade war”, Šefčovič says the EU will act “firmly” if the UK does not agree deadlines for complying with its obligations. He says: Mutually agreed compliance paths, with concrete deadlines and milestones for the UK to fulfil its existing obligations, would therefore be an important stepping stone – and, I believe, a credible outcome of this joint committee. If this does not happen, and if the UK takes further unilateral action over the coming weeks, the EU will not be shy in reacting swiftly, firmly and resolutely to ensure that the UK abides by its international law obligations. Good morning. In a long profile published yesterday, Boris Johnson was quoted as suggesting that politics is all about stories. “People live by narrative,” he told The Atlantic. “Human beings are creatures of the imagination.” And so, with tension with the EU over the implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol escalating (or non-implementation - the UK has unilaterally delayed implementing some of the rules it agreed), Johnson may be pleased that its version of the story references one of the great plot lines from the classic Whitehall comedy, Yes Minister. If you don’t remember the Euro sausage episode, there are reminders here and here. My colleague Daniel Boffey’s slightly more measured take on the story is here. George Eustice, the environment secretary, did an interview round this morning and he claimed the Northern Ireland protocol would make it impossible for traders to sell sausages from Great Britain in Northern Ireland. He told Sky News: What you have to bear in mind is that the protocol always envisaged that both parties would show best endeavours to make the Northern Ireland protocol work, and that included recognising that Northern Ireland was an integral part of the UK and that you should support the free flow of goods to Northern Ireland. What we really need the EU to do is to respect that part of the protocol and put in place sensible measures to remove things like the nonsensical ban on selling sausages or chicken nuggets to Northern Ireland – not just requiring paperwork, but actually having an outright ban on some of those goods – that clearly doesn’t make sense.

But Eustice said: I suspect that any US administration would be amazed if you were to say, for instance, that a sausage from Texas couldn’t be sold to California, there would be an outright ban – they really wouldn’t understand how that could even be contemplated. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Boris Johnson chairs cabinet. 9.30am: The ONS publishes its weekly death figures for England and Wales. 9.30am: Bill Crothers, who worked for Greensill Capital for a period while still chief commercial officer at the Cabinet Office, gives evidence to the Commons public administration and constitutional affairs committee. 11.30am: Matt Hancock, the health secretary, takes questions in the Commons. 12pm: Downing Street is expected to hold its daily lobby briefing. After 2pm: Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, makes a statement on Covid to the Scottish parliament. After 2.30pm: MPs begin an emergency debate on cuts to the aid budget. The motion is a neutral one – “that this house has considered the matter of the 0.7% official development assistance target” – and there will be no division at the end.

At the weekend, the UK prime minister said he would urge the G7 leaders to vaccinate the world against Covid by the end of next year.</p> <p>But is this feasible? That rather depends on your definition. No country will vaccinate every adult. Vaccinating enough to achieve herd immunity, which could be 60% or 70%, is the real aim. It is possible to achieve that by December 2023, say experts, but only if the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/g7\">G7</a> leading economies move immediately to make it happen.</p> <p>The Covax scheme under the UN umbrella should have been the route to vaccination for low-income countries. It was designed as their lifeline. Covax signed contracts with manufacturers to buy 2bn doses by the end of this year. But it is stymied. Its main supplier is the Serum Institute of India, which is now churning out vaccines in response to the terrible surge in domestic cases and deaths and will not be able to fulfil its contracts to Covax or individual countries before the end of the year.</p> <p>Dr Bruce Aylward, senior adviser to the director general of the World Health Organization, who is heavily involved in the vaccine efforts, said: “This is where the UK becomes really important and the G7, because right now we’ve got this gap of death.

AFP reports: EU justice commissioner Didier Reynders announced the figure to the European parliament ahead of a vote to enshrine the document in law in time for the continent’s summer tourism season. The certificate – showing the bearer’s immunity to Covid-19 either through vaccination or previous infection, or their negative test status – is to be used for intra-EU travel from 1 July. But the commission wants as many EU countries as possible to start earlier. “The more certificates we can already issue, the easier the process will be during the summer - otherwise, we risk a big bang on the first of July, which we cannot afford,” Reynders said. As of today, nine EU countries were already issuing the documents, with more than a million citizens have received such certificates – which can be presented either online or on paper – already. EU lawmakers and capitals also agreed that, when it comes to proof of vaccinations, only the jabs authorised by the European Medicines Agency – so far those from BioNTech/Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson – would be accepted in all EU countries. But individual countries can also decide to accept, for their territory only, others, such as one produced by China, or Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine. To prevent discrimination against the unvaccinated - particularly younger Europeans who have not yet been able to access jabs given in priority to the elderly - much emphasis has also been put on testing. The parliament failed to make Covid tests for travel free of charge, but extracted money and concessions from the European Commission to make them more affordable. As we emerge from a widespread internet outage, a top Japanese virologist and government adviser has said there is a risk of spreading Covid-19 during the Tokyo Olympics. Tohoku University professor Hitoshi Oshitani was an architect of Japan’s “Three Cs* approach to the pandemic, which advises avoiding closed spaces, crowds and close contact situations. He told the Times: The government and the organising committee, including the IOC (International Olympic Committee), keep saying they*re holding a safe Olympics. But everybody knows there is a risk. It*s 100 per cent impossible to have an Olympics with zero risk...of the spread of infection in Japan and also in other countries after the Olympics. There are a number of countries that do not have many cases, and a number that don’t have any variants. We should not make the Olympics [an occasion] to spread the virus to these countries. Already postponed from last year because of the pandemic, a scaled-down version of the Games with no foreign spectators is set to start on 23 July 23 despite public fears the event could spread the coronavirus and drain medical resources. However, a former Olympian turned public health expert said she believed the Games can be pulled off with an acceptable level of risk. “There will be cases, but having one case or a couple of cases doesn’t mean that it was a failure,” Tara Kirk Sell, a professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told Reuters. Sell, a silver medallist swimmer at the 2004 Games, added: “These Games are very much a symbol of the whole world emerging from this terrible, global pandemic ... If we wanted to be as safe as possible, we’d never leave our house.” Amid the outage, my colleague Martin Belam handed over the blog, so it will be me Mattha Busby bringing you global coronavirus updates for the next couple of hours. You may contact me via email on mattha.busby.freelance@guardian.co.uk or on Twitter. Please do get in touch with any tips or thoughts. China has approved the emergency use of a Covid-19 vaccine for those as young as three, according to a spokesperson for Sinovac. That would make it the first country to offer jabs to young children. Britain ignored scientific advice and instead took a political decision when it failed to put Malta on its list of safe travel destinations, Malta foreign minister Evarist Bartolo said. Visitors to Portugal must now quarantine for 10 days on return to England, as the county’s move to the “red list” came into effect. Vietnam has started asking for public donations to buy vaccines as it struggles to contain a new coronavirus wave. Unicef has urged rich members of the G7 to start donating vaccines to poor countries now, instead of waiting to donate leftovers all at once, saying many nations don’t have capacity to roll out huge amounts in one go. India’s government will provide free vaccinations for all adults, Prime Minister Narendra Modi says, as the capital New Delhi and financial hub Mumbai ease lockdowns on falling infection levels. The state of Uttar Pradesh in India has announced that it will end some Covid restrictions. The weekday daytime curfew would be lifted in all 75 districts of the state, as all of them have fallen below 600 active Covid cases. The president of the Tokyo 2020 organizsing committee, Seiko Hashimoto, has announced that there will be restrictions on the movement media using GPS tracking during the Games. New Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Tuesday that she would get her first Covid-19 shot at the end of next week. Canada is preparing to ease birder restrictions for vaccinated travellers, Bloomberg reports. The Czech Republic has announced it will reopen its borders to EU and Serbian citizens on June 21. Spain’s football squad will be get a Covid-19 vaccine shot, less than a week before their opening Euro 2020 match, after captain Sergio Busquets tested positive. Health officials in New South Wales, Australia, have had to reiterate advice over Covid-19 after a number of businesses in Byron Shire were witnessed asking vaccinated customers not to enter their premises under the misapprehension they could shed the virus. Vietnam, once a model for its successful handling of the pandemic, has started asking for public donations to buy vaccines as it struggles to contain a new coronavirus wave. AFP reports that the south-east Asian country has vaccinated only about 1% of its population of nearly 100 million, and authorities have become increasingly alarmed by a recent spike in cases. Since last week, mobile phone users have received up to three text messages urging them to contribute to a Covid-19 vaccine fund, while civil servants have been encouraged to part with a day’s pay. Some residents, fearful of the virus’ impact on Vietnam’s economy – one of the few in the world to expand last year – told AFP they support the fundraising drive. Nguyen Tuan Anh, a civil servant, told AFP he had sent about $50 via bank transfer and SMS payment, as vaccines would mean “Vietnam’s economy will be stable and develop again”. Vietnam’s industrial northern provinces – home to key factories such as Samsung and Foxconn – have been particularly badly hit by the latest outbreak. Across the country, tens of thousands of people have lost their jobs, according to state media, with bars and restaurants forced to close in major hubs such as Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City and public gatherings cancelled. Cases have more than tripled since April to reach almost 9,000. Although the number is low in comparison to most of its south-east Asian neighbours, Vietnam’s vaccination rate per capita is the lowest in the region, and among the lowest in Asia, according to an AFP tally. The Spanish football squad’s players will be get a Covid-19 vaccine shot tomorrow, less than a week before their opening Euro 2020 match, after captain Sergio Busquets tested positive, Sports Minister Jose Manuel Rodriguez Uribes said. Busquets’ positive has thrown Spain’s tournament preparations into chaos with the remaining 23 players going into isolation along with the coaching staff. An Under-21 side led by their coach Luis de la Fuente will face Lithuania tonight in what was supposed to be the nation’s final warm-up game before the Euros. Coach Luis Enrique called up a group of six players, including Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga, to complement the squad. They will train separately in “parallel bubble” away from the main Euros squad with a view to them being added should the need occur. Reuters report that so far, all the other players and staff have tested negative. “We are making an exception because they represent us in a top level competition,” Rodriguez Uribes told Cadena Ser radio station, adding that they were already planning to give them the shots before Spain’s captain had tested positive. Health officials in New South Wales, Australia, have had to reiterate advice over Covid-19 after a number of businesses in Byron Shire were witnessed asking vaccinated customers not to enter their premises under the misapprehension they could shed the virus. The New South Wales department of health has stressed that it is impossible for people to develop, shed, or spread the virus through receiving a vaccine. The advice comes after some businesses in the small town of Mullumbimby placed signs in their windows that read: ‘If you have had the Covid-19 vaccine we ask you not to enter for two weeks or longer until any symptoms subside’. One of the signs falsely states that the spread of the virus following vaccination was emerging from “first hand accounts” and that vaccinated people were “inadvertently harming” the health of others. The town is located in the Northern Rivers region of New South Wales and is about 15km inland from Byron Bay. It is a region with a high level of vaccine hesitancy and refusal, with childhood vaccination rates among the lowest in Australia. A former paramedic who runs a World Health Organisation [WHO] approved vaccination information website, Heidi Robertson, said she was appalled to see the signs as she walked down Stuart Street on Monday. She and health professionals living in the region, including intensive care specialist Dr Rachael Heap, have been working hard for several years to educate the community about vaccination. “We wanted to change the narrative around the region, because we’ve got such a shocking rate of vaccination uptake and we are known for that in Mullumbimby,” Robertson said.

I’ll keep my focus on international Covid news here. A total of 95 deaths registered in England and Wales in the week ending 28 May mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) - the lowest number since the week ending 4 September 2020. PA note that the figure is down 11% on the previous week. It is the first time the number of deaths has been below 100 since the week ending 11 September. Around one in 100 deaths registered in the week to 28 May mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate. China has approved the emergency use of a Covid-19 vaccine for those as young as three, according to a spokesperson for Sinovac who spoke to AFP. That would make it the first country to offer jabs to young children. “In recent days, the Sinovac vaccine was approved for emergency use in three- to 17-year-olds,” the spokesperson said. But they did not confirm when the young children would be able to start receiving the shots, saying the schedule for the rollout will be decided by the National Health Commission “according to China’s current epidemic prevention and control needs and vaccine supply”. The company has completed early phase trials of the vaccine in children and adolescents, with results to be published shortly in the Lancet scientific journal, the spokesperson added. State broadcaster CCTV reported over the weekend that an unnamed official in the State Council’s epidemic response task force had said vaccines had been approved for children, and “the safety and effectiveness” had been proven. A spokesperson for China’s other major vaccine, Sinopharm, said that experts had demonstrated the effectiveness of its vaccine in children, but didn’t confirm whether it had been approved for use. A quick one from Reuters: Russia reported 9,977 new Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, including 3,817 in Moscow. The government coronavirus task force also said that 379 people had died of coronavirus-related causes in the last 24 hours, pushing the official death toll to 124,496. That’s far fewer than the 270,000 that the state statistics service says had died from Covid-19 and related causes from April 2020 to April 2021. Britain ignored scientific advice and instead took a political decision when it failed to put Malta on its list of safe travel destinations, Malta Foreign Minister Evarist Bartolo said. Britons traditionally account for a third of all arrivals on the small Mediterranean island, and opposition politicians criticised the government for failing to convince London that Malta was a safe tourist destination. Britain last week revised its so-called “green list” of countries, that do not require quarantine on return, choosing not to put any new country on it, while removing Portugal. But Bartolo said the British government did not want its nationals to go abroad because of concerns over growing coronavirus cases at home. “The British government is ignoring scientific advice. It has taken a political decision not to allow travel anywhere, despite the pressure it faces from airlines, tourism operators and the people in general,” he wrote on Facebook. Chris Scicluna reports from Valetta for Reuters that Malta on Monday reported no new Covid-19 cases for the first time in 11 months. Half of its adult population has been fully vaccinated and 75% have received a first dose of a vaccine - the highest rate within the European Union. Dr Nikki Kanani, director of primary care at NHS England, said that vaccine confidence in younger people had increased in the UK. Speaking as over-25s were invited to book their Covid-19 jabs, PA report Dr Kanani told BBC Breakfast: “We’re still seeing great uptake and we are definitely seeing younger people coming in and asking more questions, which is absolutely fine. “More than four in five 40 to 49-year-olds have had their first dose and two-thirds of 30 to 39-year-olds have already had theirs, and that is still going to increase, of course, as people come forward, so uptake remains high. “We had additional polling over the weekend that shows that the confidence in the vaccine has increased by a fifth - by 20% - in those under-40s. “What’s really important as we go into the younger categories is really appealing to people in their own communities and what our teams have done so well is reflect what a community needs locally - whether that’s setting up pop-up vaccination centres in Gurudwaras or temples, or in shopping malls or at workplaces, that has been critical to making sure that people feel confident to take up the vaccine when they’re asked to do so.” Overnight saw a rush to travel back to the UK from Portugal, as travellers had until 4am to return to avoid having to quarantine for 10 days after the country was moved from the “green” list to the “amber” list, without being placed on a watchlist first. The UK’s environment minister has been getting a tough ride on the media morning round in the UK – being asked whether the travel rules, and government advice, have to be this complicated, and why there was so little warning of the change of status. Eustace said “Our advice has always been that you should not travel to countries on the amber list.” The Gaby Hinsliff column today asks the question before Britain vaccinates children, should it vaccinate the world? She writes: Personally I was thrilled to get my vaccine and would be more than happy for my son to have it, but what brought me up short was the question I saw posed recently by the epidemiologist Adam Kucharski: if rich countries have enough vaccine left to jab children at incredibly low risk of serious illness and death, why aren’t they offering it to poorer countries where people are dying for lack of it? Shouldn’t we be taking more seriously the threat not just of humanitarian crises, but of a more resistant variant emerging in some place where the virus is currently raging out of control, fatally undermining the vaccines that remain our only real route to freedom? Only 2% of sub-Saharan Africa has had a first dose. Thailand, engulfed by a severe outbreak, is only just beginning mass vaccinations. Even if the G7 summit agrees this week to invest billions in ramping up vaccine production for poorer countries – as a group of former world leaders led by Gordon Brown wants – that takes months to come on stream. If Britain doesn’t want to seal its borders – and nothing in ministers’ confused approach to foreign holidays suggests they do – then digging an ever-stronger domestic firebreak against the more contagious Delta variant we have just imported from India won’t be enough. We’re going to need a global firebreak against something worse evolving too, and fast. Read more here: Gaby Hinsliff – Before Britain vaccinates children, should it vaccinate the world? Helen Davidson reports from Taipei: Some tentative good news from Taiwan, with a second consecutive day of cases in the 200s and no new cases from backlogged test results. As long as results are not down because of lower weekend testing, the decline is a positive sign in Taiwan’s battle against its worst outbreak of the pandemic. However with about 8,000 cases still active, fatalities have not stopped and authorities reported another 22 deaths. The new cases were mostly in New Taipei city, with 123 recorded. Another 54 were reported from the capital Taipei, while 16 were found in Miaoli where there are growing concerns over an outbreak among employees from three factories which has so far infected 211 people. Health and welfare minister, Chen Chih-shung, said the rate of positive cases in New Taipei was dropping but there was no room yet to relax current restrictions. He urged people not to travel during an upcoming long weekend and dragon-boat festival, which authorities have not cancelled. Vaccine supplies took another hit, with authorities saying expected shipments of AstraZeneca and from Covax had been delayed by about a month. Half of the 150,000 recently obtained Moderna vaccines have been allocated to frontline medical staff. China’s vaccination numbers are never low. Official figures reported by Reuters say that the nation administered about 16.3 million doses of vaccine on 7 June, bringing the total number administered to 794m. In India, the state of Uttar Pradesh has announced that it will end some Covid restrictions. The Hindustan Times reports this morning: The Uttar Pradesh government on Tuesday gave relaxations in ‘corona curfew’ in all 75 districts of the state. According to guidelines announced by the state government, districts with less than 600 active cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) can get relaxations. A state government spokesperson said that there will be relaxation in coronavirus curfew in all the districts of the state from Wednesday onwards, from 7am to 7pm, for five days. However, the night curfew – 7pm to 7am and weekend curfew (for entire day) – will continue. The UK’s environment secretary George Eustace – a man who clearly isn’t in the position where he hasn’t seen family and loved ones abroad for over a year due to travel bans – has told Sky News this morning: “I have no intention of travelling or going on a holiday abroad this summer.” He was being pressed by newly returned presenter Kay Burley on the scramble for flights back from Portugal after it was moved from the “green list” to the “amber list” with very little warning. PA Media quotes him saying: Our advice has been don’t travel unless it’s absolutely necessary. Obviously we had hoped, with these three categories that we had, we had hoped that situation would be improving in other parts of the world, that we’d be able to progressively add other countries to the green list. Sadly, that’s not the situation, we do have this new variant of concern first identified in India that is now cropping up in other countries, and we’ve just got to take a very cautious approach. Asked about the UK government’s delay in shutting down travel from India, he said “India was added as soon as we saw a spike in rates and as soon as we saw there was a reason to”, denying that the delay had been political. At the time Indian case numbers were rising and the government took no action, UK prime minister Boris Johnson had been planning to visit India in his first major trip abroad since the pandemic, with the aim of pushing a post-Brexit UK-India trade deal. Unicef has urged rich members of the G7 to start donating vaccines to poor countries now, instead of waiting to donate leftovers all at once, saying many nations don’t have capacity to roll out huge amounts in one go. Unicef’s vaccine lead Lily Caprani told BBC Newsnight governments in the UK and other G7 nations “need to donate their doses to those low income countries now, while still vaccinating their populations at home.” “Low income countries need a steady supply that they can get off the tarmac and into the arms of health care workers... The unintended consequence of saving all these vaccines up to Christmas time is that countries won’t be able to absorb them and roll them out and therefore they could end up going to waste. We could see millions of doses of vaccines not used and expiring, and that will be a tragedy.” The World Health Organization has also called on Covid-19 vaccine manufacturers to give the Covax scheme first refusal on new doses, or commit half of their volumes to the global jab equity scheme. Our health editor Sarah Boseley asks the question this morning: Can we vaccinate the world against Covid by the end of 2022? As ambitious declarations go – even for Boris Johnson – it was a big one. At the weekend, the UK prime minister said he would urge the G7 leaders to vaccinate the world against Covid by the end of next year. But is this feasible? That rather depends on your definition. No country will vaccinate every adult. Vaccinating enough to achieve herd immunity, which could be 60% or 70%, is the real aim. It is possible to achieve that by December 2023, say experts, but only if the G7 leading economies move immediately to make it happen. The Covax scheme under the UN umbrella should have been the route to vaccination for low-income countries. It was designed as their lifeline. Covax signed contracts with manufacturers to buy 2bn doses by the end of this year. But it is stymied. Its main supplier is the Serum Institute of India, which is now churning out vaccines in response to the terrible surge in domestic cases and deaths and will not be able to fulfil its contracts to Covax or individual countries before the end of the year. Dr Bruce Aylward, senior adviser to the director general of the World Health Organization, who is heavily involved in the vaccine efforts, said: “This is where the UK becomes really important and the G7, because right now we’ve got this gap of death. In June, July, August, September, there’s no vaccine out there for love nor money, in terms of being able to procure it.” Read more of Sarah Boseley’s analysis here: Can we vaccinate the world against Covid by the end of 2022? The president of the Tokyo 2020 organising committee, Seiko Hashimoto, is speaking this morning, and she is setting out some of the procedures that will be undertaken to try to keep the games safe. So far, she’s said that media will not be able to use shared accommodation, and that the media will be GPS-tracked to ensure they don’t go into unauthorised areas. She has also said that they expect to start vaccinating Olympics-related staff by mid-June. Reuters note that foreign spectators have already been banned, and organisers are expected to make a decision late this month on domestic spectators. Toshiaki Endo, the vice-president of the Tokyo organising committee, has previously suggested to Reuters some spectators could be allowed into venues, although he personally preferred a total ban to calm persistent public opposition to the Games. On the downside, I just saw this tweet today, and now I can’t stop thinking about it either… Good morning, it is Martin Belam here in London taking over today’s blog. The biggest news in England is the extension of vaccinations to those aged 25 and over this morning. If you fall into that category you can book your shot at the NHS England site here. Northern Ireland has already been offering vaccines to anybody over 18, you can find out more here. Those in Scotland and Wales can find out the latest information for them here: NHS Scotland Gov.wales Reuters: New Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Tuesday that she would get her first Covid-19 shot at the end of next week, as the country prepared to receive another 1 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine. “For me, it’s been important that I allow those in the most at risk group... to be prioritised,” Ardern said in a news conference. “I’m choosing to be vaccinated at this point in order to play my role in demonstrating that I consider it to be absolutely safe and also really critical to keep others safe,” she said. China today pledged further assistance to Southeast Asian nations in battling the pandemic, the Associated Press reports. The country’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, told his Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) counterparts that China had already delivered 100 million doses of vaccine to Asean nations along with other materials and technical help. Wang said China would “urgently implement” the China-Asean Public Health Cooperation Initiative, continue to support the Asean Emergency Medical Materials Reserve and strengthen regional public health capacity-building. “China will work with Asean to overcome the outbreak as soon as possible,” Wang told a meeting of ministers. He said the sides should explore establishing an expert panel to strengthen cooperation throughout the vaccine process, from research to use, and work to build production and distribution centres to help make vaccines affordable and accessible in the region. Though Covid-19 was first detected in China in late 2019, the nation has largely stamped out domestic transmission, although it has been accused of insufficient transparency or even seeking to conceal the origins of the pandemic. Beijing has been building influence with Asean, despite frictions with some members of the bloc over competing territorial claims in the South China Sea. Welcome to another day of the pandemic, and our continuing global coverage of the latest developments. Below are some of the key updates from the last day. Canada is preparing to ease birder restrictions for vaccinated travellers, Bloomberg reports. A top Japanese virologist and government adviser has warned of the risks of spreading infections during the Tokyo Olympics. Australia’s state of Victoria is on track to ease restrictions on residents, currently in a lockdown to deal with an outbreak of the Delta variant, authorities said. India’s government will provide free vaccinations for all adults, Prime Minister Narendra Modi says, as the capital New Delhi and financial hub Mumbai ease lockdowns on falling infection levels. A new coronavirus antibody drug appears to show promise in mouse studies, according to a study published in Nature. The Czech Republic has announced it will reopen its borders to EU and Serbian citizens on June 21. Just days before the start of the Euros, Spain’s football players and staff have returned negative Covid-19 tests after captain Sergio Busquets had to go home and quarantine. There was “delight across Ireland” as the country reopened pubs, restaurants and leisure facilities. Central Park is to host an “all-star” concert in August to mark New York’s comeback after the pandemic. New York governor Andrew Cuomo has announced that the state’s remaining coronavirus restrictions will be lifted when 70% of residents have had at least one vaccine dose.","charCount":"28404","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/mattha-busby\">Mattha Busby</a> (now); <a href=\"profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a> and <a href=\"profile/helen-davidson\">Helen Davidson</a> (earlier)"},{"headline":"German factory output falls; eurozone recession shallower than feared – business live","standfirst":"<p>Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial news</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/jun/08/massive-internet-outage-hits-websites-including-amazon-govuk-and-guardian-fastly\">Latest: Massive internet outage hits websites including Amazon, gov.uk and Guardian</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2021/jun/08/german-factory-output-bitcoin-hackers-ftse-markets-eurozone-gdp-unemployment-us-job-vacancies-climate-banks-business-live?page=with:block-60bf2e678f08336d75f0655b#block-60bf2e678f08336d75f0655b\">London’s metal trading outcry Ring to reopen </a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2021/jun/08/german-factory-output-bitcoin-hackers-ftse-markets-eurozone-gdp-unemployment-us-job-vacancies-climate-banks-business-live?page=with:block-60bf02658f0837b8708e0c99#block-60bf02658f0837b8708e0c99\">German industrial output down 1% in April</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2021/jun/08/german-factory-output-bitcoin-hackers-ftse-markets-eurozone-gdp-unemployment-us-job-vacancies-climate-banks-business-live?page=with:block-60bf0fec8f0837b8708e0d3d#block-60bf0fec8f0837b8708e0d3d\">ING: chip shortages and Suez Canal blockage hit German firms</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2021/jun/08/german-factory-output-bitcoin-hackers-ftse-markets-eurozone-gdp-unemployment-us-job-vacancies-climate-banks-business-live?page=with:block-60bf21bb8f0837b8708e0e0e#block-60bf21bb8f0837b8708e0e0e\">Activist investor targets Aviva</a>, demand £5bn capital return</li><li>Japan’s Q1 slump revised up</li><li>BAT boosted by rising demand for vaping</li></ul>","trailText":"Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial news","byline":"Graeme Wearden","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b32937f114a7aa21a17fef968c8ac46c978f7e29\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b32937f114a7aa21a17fef968c8ac46c978f7e29/0_109_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An A-class model of German car manufacturer Mercedes Benz at the production line of the Daimler factory in Rastatt, Germany.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An A-class model of German car manufacturer Mercedes Benz at the production line of the Daimler factory in Rastatt, Germany.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kai Pfaffenbach/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<div id=\"block-60bf50638f08336d75f0675a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-08T11:17:26.827Z\">12.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Fastly: We're coming back online...</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Fastly, the content delivery firm at the heart of the global web outages, has tweeted that it’s disabled the ‘service configuration’ responsible for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/jun/08/massive-internet-outage-hits-websites-including-amazon-govuk-and-guardian-fastly\">this huge disruption</a>.</strong></p> <p>Its global network is now ‘coming back online’, Fastly adds.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/fastly/status/1402221348659814411\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We identified a service configuration that triggered disruptions across our POPs globally and have disabled that configuration.

Its global network is now ‘coming back online’, Fastly adds. In the meantime, the UK’s Attorney General advised emailing the department if you can’t get through on Gov.uk (It seems to be working now...) A massive internet outage, affecting websites including the Guardian, the UK government’s website Gov.uk, Amazon, and Reddit has been traced to a failure in a content delivery network (CDN) run by Fastly. The outage, which began around 11am UK time, saw visitors to a vast array of sites receive error messages including, “Error 503 service unavailable” and a terse “connection failure”. As well as bringing down some websites entirely, the failure also broke specific sections of other services, such as the servers for Twitter that host the social network’s emojis. Fastly, a cloud computing services provider, was believed to be the cause of the problem. The company runs an “edge cloud”, which is designed to speed up loading times for websites, protect them from denial-of-service attacks, and help them deal with bursts of traffic. A massive internet outage has hit social media, government and news websites today -- including The Guardian (but if you’re reading this, we’re back...) Major sites including Amazon, Reddit and Twitch were affected, along with parts of the BBC and a host of other media outlets including the New York Times, CNN and Bloomberg News The UK government website - gov.uk - has also been hit. The outage is being linked to a problem at US cloud service company Fastly, whose content delivery network is widely used to help websites run faster and provide security. Our technology editor Alex Hern has been tweeting what we know: Reuters’ has details too: Fastly said it was investigating “the potential impact to performance with our CDN services,” according to its website. Most of Fastly’s coverage areas were facing “Degraded Performance”, the website showed. Separately, Amazon.com Inc’s retail website also seemed to be down. Amazon was not immediately available to comment. Nearly 21,000 Reddit users reported issues with the social media platform, while more than 2,000 users reported problems with Amazon, according to outage monitoring website Downdetector.com. The eurozone’s recession was much shallower than feared. Statistics body Eurostat has revised up its estimate of GDP in the first quarter of 2021; now estimating the eurozone economy only shrank by 0.3% in January-March, not the 0.6% contraction first reported. It’s a welcome boost to Europe’s economy as it tried to pull away from the pandemic. Ireland (+7.8%) and Croatia (+5.8%) recorded the sharpest increases of GDP compared to the previous quarter, followed by Estonia (+4.8%) and Greece (+4.4%). The strongest declines were observed in Portugal (-3.3%) and Slovakia (-2.0%), followed by Germany (-1.8%) and Latvia (-1.7%) Sophie Griffiths, market analyst at OANDA, says it’s a significant upward revision: After a better-than-expected first quarter, combined with easing pandemic restrictions, improving vaccine numbers, and an upbeat outlook for the coming months, there is a good chance that European bourses could continue pressing higher to fresh record levels. UK banks will for the first time be forced to reveal their exposure to the climate crisis, highlighting the risks that rising temperatures and sea levels could pose for the financial system, as part of the Bank of England’s climate stress tests this year. The stress tests will put 19 banks and insurers through three climate scenarios, according to an update released Tuesday, including one where governments fail to take further steps to curb greenhouse gas emissions, resulting in average temperature increases of 3.3C and a 3.9m rise in sea levels. The central bank will be monitoring how those scenarios could impact potential loan losses, as customers default due to slowing growth and economic uncertainty. However, the Bank of England will not identify individual businesses through the tests and will release only aggregate results for the banking and insurance sector, which will be published in May 2022. The tests will look ahead 30 years. But the central bank also confirmed that the information will not be used to set capital requirements, which determine the kind of financial cushion that banks need in order to protect them from risky loans and products on their balance sheets. Instead, the exercise is meant to improve the way banks and insurers manage risks, and prompt a strategic review of their operations in light of the climate threat. Here’s the full story: Positive Money senior economist David Barmes is disappointed the BoE isn’t going further, though: “It is concerning that the Bank of England appears to be ruling out using climate stress tests to help inform changes to capital requirements. Climate capital rules that reflect the high risk of fossil fuel investments are a necessary inevitability to ensure financial stability and alignment with the government’s climate plans, and the Bank needs to be introducing such policies without delay. “By delaying the implementation of climate capital rules, the Bank is undermining its duty to protect financial stability and support net-zero.” Investor sentiment in Germany has fallen, but hopes of a strong economic recovery this year are still on track. That’s according to the ZEW Economic Research institute. Its poll of investors’ economic sentiment has fallen to 79.8 points this month, from 84.4 in the previous month, and lower than expected But.. the survey also shows that the economy is improving; ZEW’s gauge of current conditions jumped sharply to -9.1 points from -40.1 the previous month. ZEW President Achim Wambach said in a statement. “The economic recovery is progressing,” “The decline in expectations is probably largely due to the considerably better assessment of the economic situation, which is now back at pre-crisis levels.” The City of London’s last “open outcry” trading floor is to reopen, after opposition to plans to move to all-electronic trading. The London Metal Exchange has announced that, following a consultation, the Ring will reopen for physical trading on 6th September. The move means that metal traders can look forward to returning to their red leather benches, and setting the world’s daily benchmark prices for industrial metals such as copper, aluminium and zinc by shouting buy and sell orders at each other. The Ring has been temporarily closed since the first wave of the pandemic. And back in January, the LME proposed going digital - closing one of the last remaining in-person trading sites at major financial centres. That provoked a backlash from some brokers, who insisted that physical trading was the best way to organize price discovery (while sticking to a strict dress code, keeping one’s hair presentable, not chewing gum, and never leaving one’s seat!) LME users were split on the issue, with smaller traders favouring prices being discovered in the Ring, and larger ones pushing for electronic trading. So in a delicate compromise, this outcry trading will only set lunchtime Official Prices. Closing prices will be decided electronically (as they have been since March 2020). Matthew Chamberlain, LME CEO, explains: The divergent views in response to the Discussion Paper were particularly apparent between traditional participants and some smaller physical clients on the one hand, and our larger merchant trader and financial participants on the other. However, respondents were constructive in proposing approaches to reconcile these differences, respecting the differing needs of the LME community, and preserving the unique and mutually beneficial blend of physical and financial market liquidity, which makes our market so special. Global stock markets hit a fresh record high overnight too, with the MSCI All-Country World Index touching a new peak. Investors are waiting for key events and data releases this week, such as inflation data from China (Wednesday), the next US inflation report (Thursday), and the European Central Bank’s monetary policy meeting (Thursday). They’ll all be examined for signs that the recovery is on track, and hints of when central bankers might start to tighten their stimulus packages. Ray Attrill, head of FX Strategy at National Australia Bank, says: The start of a new week has not seen much by way of price action across all asset classes. “It’s hard to avoid the sense the global markets are for the most part now simply lurching from one big event risk to the next with not a lot to see in-between. It’s another quiet day in Europe’s stock markets, as investors take a breather after some lively sessions this year. The pan-European Stoxx 600 snuck up to a new record high this morning, up 0.2% to 454.52, suggesting confidence in the recovery remains strong. However, Germany’s DAX is slightly lower, following this morning’s surprise drop in industrial output. Manufacturers such as HeidelbergCement (-2.6%), materials group Covestra (-1.3%), and carmakers Volkswagen (-1.5%) and Daimler (-1.2%) as leading the fallers. On April’s factory slowdown, Teeuwe Mevissen, senior market economist at Rabobank, says: “I think it says more about the supply constraints. The big question is how long will these remain,” “Markets are in a wait-and-see mode. Valuations are high, and they need new catalysts to justify further buying.” Back on Germany....Capital Economics’ Andrew Kenningham says its factory slowdown means the economy was under par in April. But he’s still hopeful that Germany return to growth in the current quarter, having shrunk in January-March. He writes: The decline in German industrial production in April underlines that the German economy was performing well below normal at the start of the second quarter. But things should have improved since then, so we still expect GDP to rebound after its sharp decline in Q1. British American Tobacco (+1.6%) are also in the risers, after raising revenue forecasts on the back of higher demand for ‘non-tobacco’ products (such as vaping kits and nicotine pouches). BAT now expects revenue growth guidance of above 5% for 2021, as it pushes these ‘new category’ products such as Vuse, Velo and Glo. Jack Bowles, chief executive, said BAT had a “record quarter for consumer acquisition”. “We added +1.4 million non-combustible product consumers in Q1, to reach a total of 14.9 million. “We are growing New Categories at pace, encouraging more smokers to switch to scientifically substantiated reduced-risk alternatives.” Back in February, my colleagues Rob Davies and Matthew Chapman reported how BAT had launched a £1bn campaign using social media and popular influencers to promote its e-cigarettes, vapes and pouches. They explained: Critics say that such viral videos, even if they aren’t paid-for adverts, are the consequence of a global marketing push designed to offset dwindling cigarette consumption by recruiting the nicotine consumers of the future. BAT has embarked on a £1bn campaign that harnesses the popular appeal of social media influencers, pop stars and sporting events. According to a wide-ranging report by The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, it has also attracted younger adults, non-smokers and even reached the eyes of children. Shares in UK insurance firm Aviva have jumped 3.6%, after activist investor Cevian took a 5% stake - and started pressing for change. Cevian, Europe’s biggest activist investor, is pushing for Aviva to make deeper cost cuts, and return £5bn to investors following recent asset sales. Christer Gardell, Cevian’s co-founder, says: “Aviva has been poorly managed for many years, and its high-quality core businesses have been held back by high costs and a series of bad strategic decisions.” Shares in Aviva have gained 14.7p to 425p this morning, their highest since January 2020, just before the pandemic. Aviva has been selling off international assets since CEO Amanda Blanc took the helm last summer, and pledged to focus on larger businesses in the UK, Ireland and Canada. But Cevian argues that Aviva’s share price could climb to more than £8 within three years, if it returned excess capital to shareholders through dividends or buybacks. The FT has more details... Aviva has promised substantial returns and cost reductions as central planks of its strategy shift under Blanc, who has told investors that her mantra is to move quickly. However, Cevian wants a specific return of £5bn in dividends or buybacks of capital that the insurer has in excess of regulatory requirements The activist fund also believes that the cost-cutting can go further, calling for reductions of more than £500m from Aviva’s annual cost base by 2023, compared with the management’s target of £300m. It is also pushing for a leaner management structure, according to a person familiar with the matter. In London, stocks have opened a little higher, with the FTSE 100 up 15 points or 0.2% to 7092 points. Asset manager Intermediate Capital Group are the top riser, surging 6.7%, after reporting record profits, and a 19% jump in third-party assets under management amid the recovery in markets over the last year. But oil producer Royal Dutch Shell are down 1.3%, following a drop in the oil price this morning, while steelmaker Evraz is down 1.5%. Brent crude has dipped 0.5% to $71 per barrel, after China’s crude oil imports dropped by almost 15% in May - suggesting weaker demand. Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizhuo Securities, said: “Chinese oil imports at a five-month low ... would tend to confirm weakness in the Asia market.” On a brighter note, Japan’s economy shrank by less than first feared in the January-March quarter. Q1 GDP was revised up today, to show an annualised contraction of 3.9% (so almost 1% smaller on a quarterly basis). That’s up from a preliminary reading of a 5.1% contraction (or -1.3% q/q). Government spending and corporate investment fell less than first estimated, although household spending fell slightly more. Although the upgrade is welcome, it still leaves Japan half-way into recession, and breaks its recovery in the second half of 2020. A lack of semiconductors, timber and other intermediate goods weighed on German industrial output, says Reuters: The weaker than expected industrial figures suggest that the German economy will have to rely on household spending to support a still-fragile recovery from the coronavirus crisis. “Such a combination is unparalleled: Order books in industry are well filled and production is falling,” VP Bank economist Thomas Gitzel said, adding that the supply problems with semiconductors were pushing down output in the car industry. So despite well-filled order books, manufacturing will only make a limited contribution to overall economic growth in the second quarter, Gitzel said. The week-long blockage of the Suez Canal by the Ever Given in March contributed to the supply chain problems hitting German firms in April, suggests Carsten Brzeski of ING. He writes that April’s disappointing drop in industrial production suggests the rebound of the German economy in Q2 has ‘started with shaky knees’: The disappointing start to the second quarter suggests that supply chain disruptions, like the blockage of the Suez Canal in April or the ongoing semiconductor delivery problems, have not left German industry unscathed. However despite today’s disappointment, the industrial outlook remains bright. Brzeski adds that capacity issues and the lack of qualified workers could soon return as the most pressing hurdles to growth, as lack of demand isn’t a problem. Destatis also reports that German construction output fell by 4.3% in April -- suggesting that shortages of building materials might be weighing on the sector. Energy production jumped by 6.0%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Output at German factories has fallen unexpectedly, as supply chain bottlenecks and shortages of key parts and materials such as computer chips threaten to undermine the recovery. German industrial production fell by 1.0% in April, the Federal Statistics Office reports this morning. That’s shy of forecasts of a 0.5% rise, as Europe’s largest economy looked to recover from its contraction earlier this year. Production of consumer goods slumped by 3.3% - even though some households are expected to be spending heavily this summer as lockdowns restriction are lifted. Production of intermediate goods (items used in final products) fell 0.2%, while production of heavy duty capital goods decreased by 0.1%. March’s growth was revised down too, from +2.5% to +2.2%. It means production at German factories is still 5.6% below its pre-pandemic levels, despite the pick-up in the global economy this year. Factory bosses have been warning of shortages of semiconductors, plastics, rubber and metals, with suppliers hiking prices in response. These shortfalls are threatening to undermine the recovery from last year’s economic slump, and are also pushing prices higher as firms try to recoup their costs. Yesterday we learned that German factory orders fell in April, indicating that the problems may last for some time. Semiconductor shortages are a particular problem, which has already hit car production this year. Those shortages are expected to run into next year, as ramping up chip fabrication plants takes time. Tesla is reportedly considering buying its own chip plant, to guarantee supplies. Bosch, Europe’s largest auto supplier, says car manufacturers must put “money on the table” and make a “rock solid” commitment to orders, Bosch board member Harald Krüger told the Financial Times. “The only way to get out of [the recent crisis] is to have a different level of commitment” Bosch opened a €1bn semiconductor plant in Dresden yesterday, to produce chips for its power tools in July, before beginning production on automotive chips in September. That might help to ease the chip shortage, though as Krüger says.... “Money needs to be put on the table and actually parts have to be bought. “The commitment needs to be rock solid that those parts will be bought. It can’t be: ‘Maybe I [will] buy them, prepare for it, and maybe not.’ This doesn’t work.” More here: Carmakers must ‘put money on table’ to avoid repeat of chip crisis The agenda 8.30am BST: Bank of England to publish details of its 2021 climate change stress test 10am BST: ZEW index of German economic sentiment 10am BST: Eurozone Q1 GDP and employment figures (final estimate) 11am BST: US NFIB business optimism index 1.30pm BST: US trade balance for April 3pm BST: US JOLTS index of job openings","charCount":"18897","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/graemewearden\">Graeme Wearden</a>"},{"headline":"Massive internet outage hits websites including Amazon, gov.uk and Guardian","standfirst":"<p>Technical problem traced to network run by Fastly brings some sites down entirely</p>","trailText":"Technical problem traced to network run by Fastly brings some sites down entirely","byline":"Alex Hern Technology editor","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e7a010d65d53ecec5a1305edb4536d90af2d67c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7a010d65d53ecec5a1305edb4536d90af2d67c4/0_183_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The outage was traced to a failure in a content delivery network run by Fastly.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The outage was traced to a failure in a content delivery network run by Fastly.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sergio Azenha/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>A massive internet outage has affected websites including the Guardian, the UK government’s website <a href=\"http://gov.uk/\">gov.uk</a>, Amazon and Reddit.

A 2017 problem at Amazon’s AWS hosting business, for instance, took out some of the world’s biggest websites for several hours across the entire US east coast, while a 2020 problem with Cloudflare, another CDN company, led to a half-hour outage for most of the internet in major cities across Europe and the Americas.","charCount":"2643","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/alex-hern\">Alex Hern</a> Technology editor"},{"headline":"Harry Kane and the beer garden that made England his No 1 priority","standfirst":"<p>Spurs striker reaches Euro 2020 at a crossroads but whatever his club future holds England will always be more important </p>","trailText":"Spurs striker reaches Euro 2020 at a crossroads but whatever his club future holds England will always be more important ","byline":"David Hytner","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cddfe3b9271368dfaf1a10973e91291ffb5b5e31\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cddfe3b9271368dfaf1a10973e91291ffb5b5e31/160_84_3129_1878/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Harry Kane celebrates after scoring England’s winner against Croatia in a Nations League match at Wembley in November 2018.

But it was magical, seeing these faraway faces and discovering new teams like Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia coming up against West Germany and the beautiful Dutch.</p> <p>The penalty shootout in the final was the highlight – well, one moment in that shootout: watching that impossible penalty and seeing my dad jump off the sofa when it went in.

We had virtually no money and for the first couple of nights “squatted” in a campsite near the small town of Barna. We were discovered and kicked out after two nights but only moved across the wall at the end of the property and into someone’s field by the sea for the remainder of the week.

I was 18 years old and had just finished my A-levels when the tournament was being played. When we finish our exams in Denmark, everybody throws a party at their home, which means you’re basically partying every night for weeks. My party happened to be on the night of the final, so you can imagine the atmosphere.</p> <p>The party started in the afternoon – with a five-a-side tournament in my parents’ garden, including a beer tap on the sidelines. When John Jensen made it 1-0 for Denmark against Germany, somebody popped the champagne and it went straight on to the TV we were using to watch the final – the only TV in the household, which was small by today’s standards yet catered for 40 people. The TV went black for a while, but we didn’t panic. We found a hairdryer and threw maximum heat at the TV to dry it. It started working again 10 or 15 minutes later. And the rest is history. The final was nerve-wracking and mind-blowing. We couldn’t believe we could win the thing – especially against the world champions. <em><strong>Steen Ulrich</strong></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b4cb2eb18f23820424ce49a482c5034e406f8b85\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4cb2eb18f23820424ce49a482c5034e406f8b85/0_0_3414_2339/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kim Vilfort is mobbed by team-mates after scoring the second and winning goal in the 1992 final between Denmark and Germany\" width=\"1000\" height=\"685\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kim Vilfort is mobbed by teammates after scoring Denmark’s second goal against Germany in the Euro 92 final.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shaun Botterill/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Euro 1996</h2> <p>I’d graduated from university the year before and spent a further year “working” at the university – basically still behaving like a student but getting paid for it. I watched the tournament with the university women’s football team, which I’d started up only two years before. We’re still great mates now. In fact, we had our 25-year reunion last year in the same student bar where we watched some of the matches that summer. Watching a home tournament with people who turned out to be lifelong friends amid so much hope. What more could you ask for?</p> <p>Two Alan Shearer goals from Euro 96 stand out for me. Firstly, his second against the Netherlands. I loved Gazza’s skill in the build-up but, even more than that, Teddy Sheringham shaping to shoot and then squaring it to Shearer and putting the Dutch defender on his backside. Just shading that was Shearer’s opening goal against Germany in the semi-final. I’d kitted myself up; we’d painted our faces; and I was sitting on a beer crate right in front of a massive screen at Pumphrey’s cocktail bar in Bournemouth. We all had fresh pints so, when the goal went in, arms went up and beer went down and I was drenched. It all ended in tears, literally, and I was pictured looking very mournful on the cover of the local paper the following day.</p> <p>My job at the university finished just after the tournament so I essentially spent that summer on the beach, playing football, drinking and sunbathing.

As an eight year-old that summer, Euro 2000 was special even though England were poor and crashed out early. It feels like a forgotten tournament these days, placed in a kind of purgatory between England’s ecstasy at Euro 96 and the modern era.</p> <p>Not having Sky at the time, the excitement of watching three football matches a day featuring players like Gaizka Mendieta, Luís Figo and Youri Djorkaeff felt unparalleled. I was particularly tantalised by the magnificent Dutch team of Patrick Kluivert, Dennis Bergkamp and Marc Overmars as they destroyed Yugoslavia 6-1 in the quarter-finals (while I ate scrambled egg on toast for the first time).</p> <p>I also recall my parents videotaping the whole 90 minutes of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2t_AXkTopg&amp;ab_channel=UEFA\">the England v Germany game</a> so we could all watch it together the following evening. This meant having to beg my schoolmates not to tell me the result. As far as I remember, I somehow managed to get to the end of the day still living in ignorance. It would be impossible in today’s world.</p> <p>It was my birthday during the tournament and I remember getting a Playstation from my parents, accompanied by the official Euro 2000 game. The dusty old disc retains a treasured place on the CD shelf and in my memory, not least because of the fun you could have hacking the keeper while he had the ball in his hands. Other quirks included the fact it was seemingly impossible to miss a penalty and co-commentator Mark Lawrenson’s hyper-critical heckles of players in the game’s training mode. “I’m afraid that’s <em>just</em> not good enough,” is one withering line that remains etched into my brain. <em><strong>David Spereall</strong></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fc468b0096f8f2b482ecfe4040959d0d215bef6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc468b0096f8f2b482ecfe4040959d0d215bef6e/0_0_2048_1570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Portuguese players Luis Figo (r) and Nuno Gomes (l) celebrate after Gomes scored in the quarter-final match against Turkey in 2000.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"767\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nuno Gomes celebrates with Luís Figo after scoring for Portugal against Turkey in the quarter-finals of Euro 2000.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Filippo Monteforte/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Euro 2004</h2> <p>Everywhere you looked at Euro 2004 there seemed to be superstars, whether playing for hosts Portugal, perennial dark horses Czech Republic or the “golden generation” of England. The beautiful scenery of Portugal gave the perfect backdrop for a dramatic summer of football that culminated in an underdog story only rivalled by Leicester’s title triumph in recent years. The quality of the players seemed to be spread far and wide and there were classic games throughout: from the opening game between Greece and Portugal, the all-time classic between the Czech Republic and the Netherlands in the group stage, and the quarter-final between the hosts and England.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/28/football-quiz-who-scored-last-goals-tournaments-world-cup-european-championships\">Football quiz: who scored the last goals at these tournaments?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The tournament was littered with truly gripping games. As a Scot, I enjoyed England’s late show to grab defeat from the jaws of victory in their opener against France, however seeing Greece complete their fairytale in the final was the highlight. Yes, I know they were defensive and dour, but they were also rank outsiders and I couldn’t help but fall in love with the underdogs: Giorgos Karagounis as the schemer probing, twisting, diving and providing; Traianos Dellas as strong as a Greek God at the back; and Angelos Charisteas capping off a heroic performance as a one-man battering ram with the winner in the final.</p> <p>We visited Greece later in the summer holidays and I badgered my mum to buy me one of the knock-off football shirts from the market. I was so pleased to get my hands on one with the goalscoring hero, Charisteas, on the back. <em><strong>Michael Guest</strong></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3ddc70b532de44c705c289de0bbd3cd8e9d23f87\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ddc70b532de44c705c289de0bbd3cd8e9d23f87/0_0_2000_1363/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Georgios Karagounis, left, and Theodoros Zagorakis of Greece run with the trophy after their team’s 1-0 victory over Portugal in the Euro 2004 soccer championship final.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"682\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Georgios Karagounis and Theodoros Zagorakis show off the trophy after Greece win Euro 2004.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dusan Vranic/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Euro 2008</h2> <p>The Spain side that won Euro 2008 was really good to watch and much more satisfying than their more ruthless but boring team that won the World Cup in 2010. They were worthy winners.</p> <p>However, more importantly, this was the first tournament I can remember when England did not qualify. I could watch with no concerns and just really enjoy the football. I began to have favourites, among them Spain and Russia, but if teams were knocked out it wasn’t the huge deflationary experience that watching England routinely fail to fulfil expectations was, especially in the era of the “golden generation”. It was incredibly liberating and reignited my interest in football generally.</p> <p>Since then, I have approached other tournaments in a similar way and learned to take the time to find out about other countries, their stories, their heroes and villains. I guess it broadened my horizons. I also discovered Football Weekly at the same time, so that was good. <em><strong>Ross Francis</strong></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5c2b2fe11fe68c0b0cbc357bf536023f5c2478c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c2b2fe11fe68c0b0cbc357bf536023f5c2478c1/0_0_3000_1963/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fernando Torres celebrates with David Villa after scoring for Spain against Sweden at Euro 2008.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"654\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fernando Torres celebrates with David Villa after scoring for Spain against Sweden at Euro 2008.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Rose/Bongarts/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Euro 2012</h2> <p>While I am ostensibly an England fan, I have attended many tournaments and usually watch any games for which I can get tickets. Euro 2012 is my favourite as it was a great experience overall. My friend and I went to six matches in Poland and Ukraine. We flew to Krakow, rented a car and travelled around Poland, visiting many places including the Tatras mountains and, in an afternoon that generated soul-searching, Treblinka.</p> <p>We stayed with friends and made friends. We watched matches in Warsaw, Wroclaw and Gdansk, a city I enjoyed so much that I’ve been back a few times since. We also saw a couple of matches in Lviv – the rental car was not insured to cross the border, so we parked up in Poland, crossed the border on foot and had a Ukrainian travel guide collect us in his car. We are still friends with him and his family.</p> <p>I met lovely Ukrainian and Polish people throughout the trip, but also a number of football fans from different countries. I remember drinking beer with thousands of German fans in Lviv – they could not have been more welcoming.</p> <p>The stadiums were fabulous; the sight of the amber stadium in Gdansk lives long in the memory. The football wasn’t bad either. While the tournament was eventually won by possibly the greatest European team ever, Spain, they were given a good run for their money in the group by Italy. Although the Italians could not live with them later on in the final. <em><strong>Roger Kay</strong></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8674af9bc900f3a1e27459ed114c540c9b3e0c97\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8674af9bc900f3a1e27459ed114c540c9b3e0c97/0_0_5616_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Italy fans cheer in the Warsaw fanzone during their semi-final against Germany at Euro 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Italy fans cheer in the Warsaw fanzone during their semi-final against Germany at Euro 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wojtek Radwański/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Euro 2016</h2> <p>Being Portuguese, I’m very biased. But I can’t pass up the chance to rave about Portugal winning their first major title and beating France for the first time in 40 years after semi-final heartbreaks at World Cup 2006, Euro 2000 and Euro 1984. For all of the talk of Portugal being underwhelming champions, their games were a lot of fun and produced a lot of great moments.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jul/13/world-cup-best-all-time\">Which is the best World Cup ever?

It proved that an expanded tournament could be a success.</p> <p>The highlight was the final, when Eder scored the only competitive goal of his Portugal career. I had just moved to a new job in a new location, temporarily away from my wife and family. I returned home for the weekend of the final to watch it with my family. I remember going absolutely nuts.

It’s the first international football competition I can really remember. I was nine years old, playing in a kid’s team and getting into football properly. I mostly spent my time back then playing cricket, reading Roy of the Rovers, or Shoot, drinking copious amounts of Tab, Coke or 7 Up and saving up to buy a Yorkie bar at the weekend. The tournament on that long, hot summer was all blurry satellite connections and slightly distorted sound on the commentary. But it was magical, seeing these faraway faces and discovering new teams like Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia coming up against West Germany and the beautiful Dutch. The penalty shootout in the final was the highlight – well, one moment in that shootout: watching that impossible penalty and seeing my dad jump off the sofa when it went in. This was the 1970s remember and, for good or bad, Germany were still the villains. My abiding memory is of my old man, whose left-leaning sympathies got the better of him! Thank you Mr Panenka.

This meant having to beg my schoolmates not to tell me the result. As far as I remember, I somehow managed to get to the end of the day still living in ignorance. It would be impossible in today’s world. It was my birthday during the tournament and I remember getting a Playstation from my parents, accompanied by the official Euro 2000 game. The dusty old disc retains a treasured place on the CD shelf and in my memory, not least because of the fun you could have hacking the keeper while he had the ball in his hands. Other quirks included the fact it was seemingly impossible to miss a penalty and co-commentator Mark Lawrenson’s hyper-critical heckles of players in the game’s training mode. “I’m afraid that’s just not good enough,” is one withering line that remains etched into my brain. David Spereall Euro 2004 Everywhere you looked at Euro 2004 there seemed to be superstars, whether playing for hosts Portugal, perennial dark horses Czech Republic or the “golden generation” of England. The beautiful scenery of Portugal gave the perfect backdrop for a dramatic summer of football that culminated in an underdog story only rivalled by Leicester’s title triumph in recent years. The quality of the players seemed to be spread far and wide and there were classic games throughout: from the opening game between Greece and Portugal, the all-time classic between the Czech Republic and the Netherlands in the group stage, and the quarter-final between the hosts and England. The tournament was littered with truly gripping games. As a Scot, I enjoyed England’s late show to grab defeat from the jaws of victory in their opener against France, however seeing Greece complete their fairytale in the final was the highlight. Yes, I know they were defensive and dour, but they were also rank outsiders and I couldn’t help but fall in love with the underdogs: Giorgos Karagounis as the schemer probing, twisting, diving and providing; Traianos Dellas as strong as a Greek God at the back; and Angelos Charisteas capping off a heroic performance as a one-man battering ram with the winner in the final. We visited Greece later in the summer holidays and I badgered my mum to buy me one of the knock-off football shirts from the market. I was so pleased to get my hands on one with the goalscoring hero, Charisteas, on the back. Michael Guest Euro 2008 The Spain side that won Euro 2008 was really good to watch and much more satisfying than their more ruthless but boring team that won the World Cup in 2010. They were worthy winners. However, more importantly, this was the first tournament I can remember when England did not qualify. I could watch with no concerns and just really enjoy the football. I began to have favourites, among them Spain and Russia, but if teams were knocked out it wasn’t the huge deflationary experience that watching England routinely fail to fulfil expectations was, especially in the era of the “golden generation”. It was incredibly liberating and reignited my interest in football generally. Since then, I have approached other tournaments in a similar way and learned to take the time to find out about other countries, their stories, their heroes and villains. I guess it broadened my horizons. I also discovered Football Weekly at the same time, so that was good. Ross Francis Euro 2012 While I am ostensibly an England fan, I have attended many tournaments and usually watch any games for which I can get tickets. Euro 2012 is my favourite as it was a great experience overall. My friend and I went to six matches in Poland and Ukraine. We flew to Krakow, rented a car and travelled around Poland, visiting many places including the Tatras mountains and, in an afternoon that generated soul-searching, Treblinka. We stayed with friends and made friends. We watched matches in Warsaw, Wroclaw and Gdansk, a city I enjoyed so much that I’ve been back a few times since. We also saw a couple of matches in Lviv – the rental car was not insured to cross the border, so we parked up in Poland, crossed the border on foot and had a Ukrainian travel guide collect us in his car. We are still friends with him and his family. I met lovely Ukrainian and Polish people throughout the trip, but also a number of football fans from different countries. I remember drinking beer with thousands of German fans in Lviv – they could not have been more welcoming. The stadiums were fabulous; the sight of the amber stadium in Gdansk lives long in the memory. The football wasn’t bad either. While the tournament was eventually won by possibly the greatest European team ever, Spain, they were given a good run for their money in the group by Italy. Although the Italians could not live with them later on in the final. Roger Kay Euro 2016 Being Portuguese, I’m very biased. But I can’t pass up the chance to rave about Portugal winning their first major title and beating France for the first time in 40 years after semi-final heartbreaks at World Cup 2006, Euro 2000 and Euro 1984. For all of the talk of Portugal being underwhelming champions, their games were a lot of fun and produced a lot of great moments. Beyond Portugal, you had the wonderful runs of Wales and Iceland, the Republic of Ireland beating Italy, and both them and Northern Ireland making it to the last 16. You had Hal Robson Cruyff, the Italy v Germany penalty shootout in the quarter-final, Renato Sanches exploding in his first major tournament, and so many other great moments. It proved that an expanded tournament could be a success. The highlight was the final, when Eder scored the only competitive goal of his Portugal career. I had just moved to a new job in a new location, temporarily away from my wife and family. I returned home for the weekend of the final to watch it with my family. I remember going absolutely nuts. I was lifted by more people that day than when I was a baby.

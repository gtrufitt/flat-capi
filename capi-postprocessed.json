You mentioned, in your opener there, that we‚Äôve had situations in Victoria where people have caught Covid from one another by brushing past one another in a store.

disappointed that it certainly appears that we don‚Äôt have continual adoption of best practice right across the system.</strong> <strong>One of the things I talked about in October last year is the need to make sure best practice is adopted. </strong><br></p> <p>And as we‚Äôve discussed before, this virus is not staying still waiting for us to catch up with it and get in front of it, the virus continues to change. <br></p> <p><strong>That means our systems need to continue to adapt.</strong> And certainly, as it‚Äôs been reported, some of the breaches we have seen recently are a direct reflection of an absence of best practice in some of these systems. <br></p> <p>So to say that I‚Äôm disappointed about that I think is the minimum, I would say.</p> </blockquote> <p>Halton said while she welcomed the expansion of the Howard Springs dedicated quarantine facility, she also found it ‚Äúa bit perplexing that it‚Äôs taken us this long‚Äù.</p> <p>Halton had recommended national quarantine facilities, purpose built to handle the job. She doesn‚Äôt care where they are - as long as they are built to purpose.<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> I‚Äôm not wedded to one particular location over another. I think the style of quarantine that we‚Äôre talking about here is what‚Äôs important. And having that as a significant component of our quarantine program is certainly desirable. And that‚Äôs what I talked about.</p> </blockquote> <p>The interview finished with this:</p> <p><strong>Hamish Macdonald: </strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I know you‚Äôre someone who in Canberra has been known to be frank.

Murphy laughs and says ‚Äòno‚Äô. Smith is now outlining the ‚Äúenormity of the exercise‚Äù Murphy and health officials have had in ‚Äúkeeping this country safe,‚Äù including Murphy going back to the office to answer emails after he finished his estimates appearance at 11pm. Smith thanks him and the department for their work. ‚ÄúThe arguments and discussions we are having are around the fringes of the issues,‚Äù Smith says. Labor senator Murray Watt says everyone is grateful, but it is still the job of estimates to ask questions about things which have gone well and things which have not gone so well. So, that‚Äôs settled. Everyone is grateful for the job officials have done, but there are still things which have gone not as well as they could have, and that should be questioned. Labor MP Clare O‚ÄôNeil was a guest on RN Breakfast this morning, where she was asked by Hamish Macdonald why Victoria ‚Äòcan‚Äôt seem to get on top of outbreaks‚Äô like other states. Her answer has caused a little flurry on social media, after she compared movement in Sydney and Melbourne. I‚Äòm in lockdown in my home in Victoria, right now. It feels like a little bit of an unfair question and we‚Äôve got to remember that this outbreak actually came through a leak from South Australian quarantine. You would have heard a number of epidemiologists answering the question that you‚Äôve just asked me over previous days and so I don‚Äôt want to get into the science too deeply as that‚Äôs really their role. But, I think, they‚Äôve referred to a bunch of specific things about Victoria - the layout of the city, for example, is one where people move around a lot more than they do versus Sydney, for example, where people tend to stay within their suburbs or their regions. But, the most important thing that‚Äôs happening right now in Victoria, Hamish, is that we are dealing with a much more contagious form of Covid than we‚Äôve seen in any previous outbreaks. You mentioned, in your opener there, that we‚Äôve had situations in Victoria where people have caught Covid from one another by brushing past one another in a store. This has never happened before in a Covid outbreak and I personally am glad that the Victorian government‚Äôs being pretty conservative. We‚Äôll get on to aged care in a minute but we know, through bitter, bitter experience, the agony that can be caused when we don‚Äôt get on top of outbreaks and we‚Äôre proud as Victorians that we‚Äôre working together as a community to protect people that are vulnerable. At least in my feed, Sydney residents seem incensed at being described as dwelling in the suburbs a little more. But an epidemiologist did say it: The Greens senator Rachel Siewert is questioning Professor Brendan Murphy why ventilation is not in the guidelines for quarantine. Murphy says the states and territories are looking at it, but it is not in the guidelines, because it‚Äôs a building and engineering process. Siewert says that is ‚Äòsemantics‚Äô. Murphy says CMO Professor Paul Kelly will be able to answer more of those questions later this afternoon. So things are going well then. For those asking, we learnt yesterday that Victoria doesn‚Äôt give any information to its federal counterparts until it has sent out its tweet with the daily numbers. That is something that happened during the second outbreak. Once the numbers are out, Victorian authorities, through their usual departmental channels, share the information with other health authorities. It‚Äôs part of the information share that lets each jurisdiction know what is happening, so they can make their own decisions regarding health orders and borders. Brendan Murphy is the head of the federal health department and he is facing estimates today ‚Äì it is only normal he would receive the information, and when asked in estimates, he is sharing that information. Over in health estimates, Prof Brendan Murphy has given a little more information about the six new Victorian cases. Five are linked to known cases, he says, while the sixth is the person NSW Health put an alert out about last night. As we wait on the Victorian press conference, which is likely to confirm an extension of the lockdown, please keep in mind the thousands of people who have lost a week‚Äôs pay with no warning, and are on the cusp of losing another. As late as yesterday afternoon, federal Liberal party MPs were arguing it was the job of the Victorian government to provide financial support if it extended the lockdown, pointing to lockdowns in WA and Queensland, which have occurred with no jobkeeper assistance. But both were much, much shorter. Three days is one thing - and it is hard enough. A week can be devastating. Anything longer than that, and you risk your whole life falling apart. Not everyone has the bank of mum and dad to fall back on. Not everyone has savings. Not everyone can just ‚Äògo a week‚Äô without pay. The uncertainty so many people must be facing right now is heartbreaking. This is some more good news. Mike Bowers has been out and about this morning. The department of health is in front of senate estimates today ‚Äì with quarantine the topic of the morning hearings. Last night, estimates heard there had been 21 breaches of hotel quarantine. It was a hotel quarantine breach in Adelaide which sparked the most recent Victorian lockdown. Jane Halton, who (among many, many other reviews) was handed the job of reviewing Australia‚Äôs hotel quarantine system, was asked on ABC radio RN this morning how she thought quarantine was going. She was fairly plain spoken: Well, I‚Äôm disappointed that it certainly appears that we don‚Äôt have continual adoption of best practice right across the system. One of the things I talked about in October last year is the need to make sure best practice is adopted. And as we‚Äôve discussed before, this virus is not staying still waiting for us to catch up with it and get in front of it, the virus continues to change. That means our systems need to continue to adapt. And certainly, as it‚Äôs been reported, some of the breaches we have seen recently are a direct reflection of an absence of best practice in some of these systems. So to say that I‚Äôm disappointed about that I think is the minimum, I would say. Halton said while she welcomed the expansion of the Howard Springs dedicated quarantine facility, she also found it ‚Äúa bit perplexing that it‚Äôs taken us this long‚Äù. Halton had recommended national quarantine facilities, purpose built to handle the job. She doesn‚Äôt care where they are - as long as they are built to purpose. I‚Äôm not wedded to one particular location over another. I think the style of quarantine that we‚Äôre talking about here is what‚Äôs important. And having that as a significant component of our quarantine program is certainly desirable. And that‚Äôs what I talked about. The interview finished with this: Hamish Macdonald: I know you‚Äôre someone who in Canberra has been known to be frank. Would your frank and fearless advice to government now be, ‚ÄòAlright, pull your socks up, get on with this‚Äô? Halton: Certainly, that is my advice. That we should be getting on with this as a priority. Definitely. The numbers are in. These six new cases bring the total number associated with this outbreak to 60. More than 51,000 tests though, and 20,500 vaccinations. That‚Äôs incredible, Victoria. In defending the federal government for not vaccinating aged care workers (in June), a group of people who were meant to be in the priority 1A group, Queensland senator Matt Canavan attacked the Queensland Labor government for not immediately vaccinating health care workers months ago. (The Queensland government, like Victoria, is launching its own vaccination blitz to speed up the vaccination roll out for aged and disability care workers) Canavan told the Nine Network: This is from the government only a few months ago had failed to vaccinate their frontline workers and partly led to the Brisbane outbreak. It‚Äôs a bit hypocritical for them to be throwing mud about aged care centres when they didn‚Äôt do the same in their own hospitals just a few months ago. Queensland is also the state with the lowest utilisation rate of the vaccines. They‚Äôve never properly explained why they‚Äôve only used 64% of their vaccines when Victoria and NSW are 80%. Maybe Queensland will finally start using its vaccines, that will be a positive. For reasons unknown to anyone, members of the federal government continue to argue over whether or not the vaccine roll out is ‚Äúa race‚Äù. Here was Dan Tehan on the Seven Network this morning: If it was a race, how would you handicap at? Let‚Äôs get serious about this. It is a rollout, I can tell you I‚Äôll be having my second vaccination this week and I say to all Australians listening to the show, go up, get vaccinated. That‚Äôs the best thing all of us can do. Labor has announced a new ‚Äòyouth engagement‚Äô model: If elected, an Albanese Labor government will:- Establish a framework to directly and formally engage with young Australians on an ongoing basis. Establish an Office for Youth so that, rather than youth engagement being an afterthought or duplicating functions across departments, there is a dedicated unit within government to feed in the contribution from young people and advocates, improve and harmonise policy across government, and ensure government is communicating effectively with young people. Commit to a Minister for Youth to improve and facilitate a holistic response across portfolios on issues affecting young Australians. The ABC has reported the crew member who tested positive to Covid and was removed from a freight ship docked in WA has now tested negative. He is thought to be a historical case. We are all still waiting on official confirmation of today‚Äôs results (as well as official word on the lockdown being extended) but this is hopefully some good news. It being June means Mathias Cormann is officially the OECD head. As part of his maiden speech Cormann, apparently a huge fan of the Paris agreement now, said: Across the OECD‚Äôs diverse membership, different countries and regions around the world have different opportunities to make the strongest possible contribution to our collective emissions reduction outcomes and the net-zero emissions target locked into the Paris Agreement. We all face similar transition challenges and can all agree that effective global action on climate change is a must and we must get to zero net emissions as soon as possible. Climate policy responses will increasingly need to factor into long-term planning. Economic recovery efforts to Covid-19 are a key opportunity to target support towards investments that drive the development and commercialisation of new technologies. Through the OECD, we can come together to share ideas about our collective green recovery effort on our journey towards a low emissions future. As Secretary-General I will strive to make the OECD a place that inspires collaboration and action in support of a sustainable future.

The administration pledged to take action to address racial housing discrimination and use its purchasing power to direct an additional $100bn to small disadvantaged business owners. Biden will meet tomorrow with Republican Senator Shelley Moore Capito to discuss a potential compromise on infrastructure. The meeting comes a week after Republicans outlined their latest offer, which called for spending $928bn on infrastructure over the next eight years, far less than what Biden has proposed. Biden issued a proclamation to mark the start of LGBTQ+ Pride Month. ‚ÄúThis Pride Month, we recognize the valuable contributions of LGBTQ+ individuals across America, and we reaffirm our commitment to standing in solidarity with LGBTQ+ Americans in their ongoing struggle against discrimination and injustice,‚Äù the president said in his proclamation. Kamala Harris was tapped to lead the administration‚Äôs efforts to protect voting rights.‚ÄúIn the last election, more people voted than ever before.

The administration had paused the program in January. In a memo sent to agency leaders today, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said the policy did not ‚Äúadequately or sustainably enhance border management.‚Äù In March, Valerie Gonzalez wrote for the Guardian about the impact of Biden pausing the remain in Mexico policy earlier this year: A dusty soccer ball lay idle and forgotten a few days ago at an empty dwelling that had been knitted together from billowing, fraying plastic tarps tied to dead trees in the Mexican city of Matamoros. The vignette of the abandoned shelter is expected to replicate across the makeshift migrant camp in the coming weeks, wedged between the edge of the city and the swirling Rio Grande, across the border from south-east Texas. Hundreds have been hovering, somewhere between living and existing, since 2019 under Donald Trump‚Äôs program known as ‚ÄúRemain in Mexico‚Äù while their immigration cases are processed in the US. After several 11th-hour delays, people are now starting to depart the camp to argue their asylum cases in the United States. Nearly 25,000 people out of at least 70,000 who crossed the US-Mexico border and were sent back, under the policy known more formally as the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), are now eligible to be reprocessed on the US side. Joe Biden pledged ‚Äúmore fair, orderly and humane‚Äù immigration processes and has ordered the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to review MPP. If squalid, dangerous camps in places like Matamoros become obsolete, few will mourn. Although Biden has reversed many of Trump‚Äôs most restrictive border policies, he has left in place Title 42 ‚Äì a provision that allows the US to send back migrants arriving at the southern border due to the pandemic. Immigration advocates say the policy blocks access for many asylum seekers who arrive at the US-Mexico border, trapping them in unsafe conditions. Human rights groups are calling on the Biden administration and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) to put an end to a digital surveillance program that keeps tabs on nearly 100,000 immigrants. A new report called Ice Digital Prisons, authored by the Latinx organizing group Mijente and immigration legal rights group Just Futures Law, highlights how Ice uses apps, GPS-tracking ankle monitors and facial recognition software to monitor people ‚Äì saying these tactics ‚Äúdo more harm and inhibit any true progress in providing the social and economic tools for immigrants to thrive in their communities‚Äù. The report says that the use of such technologies further criminalizes immigrants and affects their social and economic wellbeing. The Biden administration is under growing pressure to right the wrongs of the Trump administration‚Äôs immigration policies and keep families out of detention facilities. One of its solutions has been to stress the importance of funding digital methods for tracking immigrants rather than physically imprisoning them. The digital alternatives program has been growing in recent years, with funding increasing from $28m in 2006 to $440m in 2021. The ‚Äúalternatives to detention‚Äù program tracks 96,574 individuals, but the Biden administration‚Äôs 2022 budget request calls to increase that number by approximately 45,000 to 140,000. These alternatives ‚Äúsupport migrants as they navigate their legal obligations‚Äù, the Biden administration has said, and are meant to be less-harmful alternatives to physical detention. But Julie Mao, an immigration attorney with Just Futures Law and an editor on the report, said that is not the case. Read more: A proposal to be tabled by the US president, Joe Biden, at the upcoming G7 meeting for a 15% global corporate tax rate could reap the EU ‚Ç¨50bn (¬£43bn) a year, and earn the UK nearly ‚Ç¨200m extra alone from the British multinational BP, according to research. Should the tax rate be set higher at 25%, the lowest current rate within the seven largest world economies, the EU would earn nearly ‚Ç¨170bn extra a year ‚Äì more than 50% of current corporate tax revenue and 12% of total health spending in the bloc. Among multinationals headquartered in the UK, it is claimed that BP‚Äôs corporate tax bill would increase at that rate by ‚Ç¨484.9m, Barclays by ‚Ç¨911m a year and HSBC‚Äôs by ‚Ç¨4.2bn. The estimates will be published on Tuesday by a new independent research organisation, the EU Tax Observatory, which models the ‚Äútax deficit‚Äù of multinationals, defined as the difference between current tax payments and the sums due if global profits were subject to the same rate wherever they are booked. Under Biden‚Äôs proposal, multinational corporations would be prevented from shifting profits across borders to exploit the most attractive low-tax locations as their profits would be taxed at a minimum global corporation tax rate either where they are booked or headquartered. The Biden administration initially proposed a rate of 21% but last week revised the target down, saying it should be ‚Äúat least‚Äù 15%, although this is regarded by the White House as a ‚Äúfloor‚Äù and that discussions should continue to push that rate higher. The UK chancellor, Rushi Sunak, is understood to be skeptical about higher levels mooted for a minimum corporate tax rate while expressing support for the principle. The Treasury has said they have concerns that the policy could lead to economic activity in the UK being taxed elsewhere. The UK has the lowest corporate tax rate in the G7 at 19% although it will rise to 25% by April 2023. Kamala Harris, who was tapped today to lead the administration‚Äôs efforts to protect voting rights, has released a statement endorsing the Democrats‚Äô The For the People Act and John Lewis Voting Rights Act. ‚ÄúIn the last election, more people voted than ever before. Since then, more than 380 bills have been introduced across the country that would make it harder for Americans to vote,‚Äù she said. These bills seek to restrict the options that make voting more convenient and accessible, including early voting and vote by mail.‚Äù Harris and Joe Biden have long endorsed the Democrats‚Äô two major voting rights bills ‚Äì which face a steep road ahead. In the Senate, Republicans and some moderate Democrats like Joe Manchin of West Virginia have opposed the For the People Act. Manchin called it ‚Äútoo darn broad‚Äù and partisan. He, Arizona‚Äôs Kyrsten Sinema and other Democrats have also resisted their colleague‚Äôs efforts to pass the bill by gutting the filibuster, a procedural obstacle that prevents most bills that don‚Äôt have the support of at least 60 senators from ever getting a vote. It‚Äôs unclear what, if anything, Harris could do to change these realities. Having served in the Senate for four years, she has some ties in the chamber. But Biden, who served in the chamber for nine times has long, is thought to have much deeper relationships with Senators ‚Äì and has been unable to win them over. ‚ÄúI will work with voting rights organizations, community organizations, and the private sector to help strengthen and uplift efforts on voting rights nationwide,‚Äù Harris said. ‚ÄúAnd we will also work with members of Congress to help advance these bills.‚Äù Harris has also been tasked with diplomatic efforts in the Northern Triangle, leading the efforts to expand broadband internet and other issues. Biden closed out his speech in Oklahoma this afternoon by comparing white supremacist atrocities in the past, such as the Tulsa massacre, to extremist threats today. ‚ÄúWe must address what remains the stain on the soul of America. What happened in Greenwood was an act of hate and an act of domestic terrorism, with a through-line that exists today, still,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúRemember what you saw in Charlottesville four years ago, on television, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, the KKK [Ku Klux Klan], coming out of those fields at night in Virginia, their lighted torches, the veins bulging as they were screaming.‚Äù ‚ÄúWell, [massacre survivor] Mother Fletcher said that when she saw the insurrection at the Capitol on January 6, it broke her heart,‚Äù he continued: ‚ÄúA mob of violent white extremists, thugs, said it reminded her of what happened here, 100 years ago, in Greenwood. Look around at the various hate crimes against Asian Americans and Jewish Americans, hate that never goes away.‚Äù Someone from the audience called out ‚Äúthat‚Äôs true‚Äù. Biden went on: ‚ÄúAnd given a little bit of oxygen by its leaders it comes out from under the rock like it was happening again, as if it never went away.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt give hate a safe harbor. According to the intelligence community, terrorism from white supremacy is the most lethal threat to the homeland today,‚Äù he said. The Biden administration has suspended oil and gas leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge that were issued in the final days of Donald Trump‚Äôs presidency. Just two weeks before Biden was inaugurated, the Trump administration had actioned the right to drill in the expansive, delicate tundra that is home to migrating waterfowl, denning polar bears and herds of Porcupine caribou. The move drew fierce opposition from Alaska Native activists and environmental groups ‚Äì who lobbied Biden to quickly claw back the 1.5m acre of the refuge that has been opened up to fossil fuel production. Here‚Äôs more background on the Trump administration‚Äôs move: Joe Biden‚Äôs speech in Tulsa has now concluded, and that‚Äôs it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here‚Äôs where the day stands so far: Biden delivered remarks in Tulsa to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the city‚Äôs race massacre. The president emphasized the importance of acknowledging the lives and livelihoods lost in the massacre, which resulted in the death of at least 300 African Americans and the destruction of 35 blocks of Black real estate. ‚ÄúFor much too long, the history of what took place here was told in silence, cloaked in darkness,‚Äù Biden said. ‚ÄúMy fellow Americans, this was not a riot, this was a massacre.‚Äù Biden met with the three living survivors of the massacre before delivering his speech.

Maanvi will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Joe Biden has just announced that he will tap Kamala Harris to lead the administration‚Äôs efforts to strengthen national voting rights. Biden described the recent Republican efforts in dozens of states to limit access to the ballot box as ‚Äúun-American‚Äù. The president pledged he would ‚Äúfight like heck with every tool at my disposal‚Äù to pass the For the People Act, Democrats‚Äô expansive election reform bill, and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. Biden also appeared to criticize two moderate Senate Democrats, Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, referencing ‚Äútwo members of the Senate who vote more with my Republican friends‚Äù. Manchin has said he opposes the For the People Act. Joe Biden underscored the importance of recognizing the devastating impact that the Tulsa race massacre had on Black lives and livelihoods. At least 300 African Americans were killed in the 1921 massacre, and about 35 blocks of Black real estate in the Greenwood neighborhood were destroyed. ‚ÄúFor much too long, the history of what took place here was told in silence, cloaked in darkness,‚Äù Biden said. ‚ÄúBut just because history is silent it doesn‚Äôt mean that it did not take place. While darkness can hide much, it erases nothing.‚Äù The president added, ‚ÄúMy fellow Americans, this was not a riot, this was a massacre.‚Äù Joe Biden noted that he is the first US president to ever visit Tulsa to commemorate the anniversary of the 1921 race massacre that killed at least three hundred African Americans. ‚ÄúThe events we speak of today took place 100 years ago ‚Äì and yet I‚Äôm the first president in 100 years ever to come to Tulsa,‚Äù Biden said, emphasizing the need to ‚Äúacknowledge the truth of what took place here‚Äù. The president specifically acknowledged the three living massacre survivors with whom he met today ‚Äì Viola ‚ÄúMother‚Äù Fletcher, Hughes ‚ÄúUncle Red‚Äù Van Ellis and Lessie ‚ÄúMother Randle‚Äù Benningfield Randle. ‚ÄúYou are the three known remaining survivors of a story seen in the mirror dimly ‚Äì but no longer,‚Äù Biden said. ‚ÄúNow your story will be known in full view.‚Äù Joe Biden is now delivering remarks on the 100th anniversary of the 1921 race massacre in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Before launching into his prepared remarks, the president walked into the audience to speak to two young girls sitting toward the front of the crowd. Returning to the mic, Biden explained, ‚ÄúI just had to make sure the two girls got ice cream when this is over.‚Äù Joe Biden will soon deliver remarks at the Greenwood Cultural Center in Tulsa, Oklahoma, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the city‚Äôs race massacre. According to a White House pool report, there are about 200 people in attendance for Biden‚Äôs speech, including civil rights leaders Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton. The speech comes immediately after Biden met with the three living survivors of the massacre ‚Äì Viola ‚ÄúMother‚Äù Fletcher, Hughes ‚ÄúUncle Red‚Äù Van Ellis and Lessie ‚ÄúMother Randle‚Äù Benningfield Randle ‚Äì all of whom are over 100 years old. Joe Biden is now meeting with the three living survivors of the Tulsa race massacre, according to the latest White House pool report. Those survivors are Viola ‚ÄúMother‚Äù Fletcher, Hughes ‚ÄúUncle Red‚Äù Van Ellis and Lessie ‚ÄúMother Randle‚Äù Benningfield Randle. They are all between the ages of 101 and 107. The three survivors testified two weeks ago at a House subcommittee hearing on the need to financially compensate massacre survivors and their descendants. ‚ÄúI will never forget the violence of the white mob when we left our home,‚Äù Fletcher told House members. ‚ÄúI still see Black men being shot, Black bodies lying in the street. I still smell smoke and see fire. I still see Black businesses being burned. I still hear airplanes flying overhead. I hear the screams. I have lived through the massacre every day.‚Äù It is one of the extraordinary elements of the 1921 catastrophe that survivors are still alive. Three individuals are active today who as children experienced the horror of white sadism perpetrated on that day. The oldest of the trio, Mother Viola Fletcher, just turned 107. At a recent event in Tulsa, she walked unassisted to the podium and recalled what happened to her as a seven-year-old girl. ‚ÄúI still remember all the shooting and running,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúPeople being killed. Crawling and seeing smoke. Seeing airplanes flying, and a messenger going through the neighbourhood telling all the Black people to leave town.‚Äù Then Fletcher stopped speaking. Even after 100 years, the memories of that day still have the power to overwhelm her. Joe Biden is now touring an exhibit on the 1921 race massacre at the Greenwood Cultural Center in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The president will soon deliver remarks at the center to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the massacre, which killed at least 300 African Americans. In his remarks in Tulsa this afternoon, Joe Biden is expected to formally unveil a new set of initiatives aimed at narrowing the racial wealth gap in America. But the policies, which the White House announced this morning, are already attracting some criticism from the NAACP. The Washington Post reports: Biden‚Äôs proposals drew immediate criticism from the nation‚Äôs most prominent civil rights group, the NAACP, whose leader said the president‚Äôs plan omitted canceling student debt, one of the most effective ways to shrink the wealth gap, according to some researchers. ‚ÄòComponents of the plan are encouraging, but it fails to address the student loan debt crisis that disproportionately affects African Americans,‚Äô said Derrick Johnson, president of the NAACP. ‚ÄòYou cannot begin to address the racial wealth gap without addressing the student loan debt crisis.‚Äô Although he applauded Biden‚Äôs focus on homeownership as a way to build wealth, Johnson pointed out that many African Americans simply won‚Äôt qualify for needed loans because of a high debt-to-income ratio. That‚Äôs particularly true, he said, among government workers. ‚ÄòThat must be addressed if there is going to be a question of dealing with the racial wealth gap,‚Äô Johnson said. He supports cutting as much as $50,000 per person in student debt but said it is not a ‚Äòmagic number.‚Äô Joe Biden has arrived in Tulsa, Oklahoma, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the city‚Äôs race massacre. The president is accompanied on the trip by housing and urban development secretary Marcia Fudge, domestic policy adviser Susan Rice and senior adviser Cedric Richmond. The president will first tour the Greenwood Cultural Center, which is dedicated to honoring the hundreds of African Americans who died in the massacre. Biden will later deliver remarks on the massacre, and he is expected to formally unveil a series of new initiatives that his administration is launching to narrow the racial wealth gap in the country. The White House has also said Biden will meet with survivors of the massacre, three of whom testified before Congress two weeks ago. Florida Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried has officially filed paperwork to run for governor next year. The filing follows months of speculation that Fried, currently the only Florida Democrat serving in a statewide office, would jump into the race to unseat Republican incumbent Ron DeSantis. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here to break the rigged system in Florida,‚Äù Fried said in a video announcing her candidacy. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs corrupt, it‚Äôs anti-democratic, and it‚Äôs time for something new.‚Äù Fried will have some competition for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, as congressman Charlie Crist has already announced his campaign. Democratic state Senator Annette Taddeo is also considering launching a bid. Whoever wins the Democratic primary race will have to run against DeSantis, who has positioned himself as a potential successor to Donald Trump in the Republican party. Fried has repeatedly criticized DeSantis over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and has called for an FBI investigation into allegations that the governor gave early vaccine access to some of his donors. In case you missed it this morning: Joe Biden issued a proclamation to mark the beginning of LGBTQ+ Pride Month. ‚ÄúThis Pride Month, we recognize the valuable contributions of LGBTQ+ individuals across America, and we reaffirm our commitment to standing in solidarity with LGBTQ+ Americans in their ongoing struggle against discrimination and injustice,‚Äù the president said in his proclamation. Biden touted the level of LGBTQ+ representation in his administration, saying, ‚ÄúNearly 14 percent of my 1,500 agency appointees identify as LGBTQ+, and I am particularly honored by the service of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, the first openly LGBTQ+ person to serve in the Cabinet, and Assistant Health Secretary Dr. Rachel Levine, the first openly transgender person to be confirmed by the Senate.‚Äù The president noted the LGBTQ+ community has achieved ‚Äúremarkable progress‚Äù since the Stonewall Inn riots of June 1969, but he also emphasized that much work still needs to be done to ensure equal rights for LGBTQ+ Americans. He specifically mentioned the recent wave of state bills aimed at restricting trans students‚Äô participating in school athletics. ‚ÄúDuring LGBTQ+ Pride Month, we recognize the resilience and determination of the many individuals who are fighting to live freely and authentically. In doing so, they are opening hearts and minds, and laying the foundation for a more just and equitable America,‚Äù Biden said. ‚ÄúThis Pride Month, we affirm our obligation to uphold the dignity of all people, and dedicate ourselves to protecting the most vulnerable among us.‚Äù Joe Biden will soon become the first sitting US president to visit the site of the white supremacist race massacre in Tulsa 100 years ago. There‚Äôs been a press huddle aboard Air Force One en route to Oklahoma, where Biden plans to meet with the last survivors of the massacre and announce new investment in Greenwood, the area of Tulsa that was razed by a white mob in 1921, and communities like it where majority-Black populations endure entrenched disadvantage in business, work and housing as a result of racial discrimination. Reuters reports: ‚ÄúWhat these survivors have endured is tragic and devastating,‚Äù White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on the flight to Oklahoma on Tuesday. He plans to listen, learn and portray his heartfelt gratitude to them for sharing their stories, she said. The president will address the U.S. legacy of racist violence, and the challenges to unity ahead, an administration official said. Biden cannot fulfill his promise to restore the ‚Äúsoul‚Äù of the nation without recognizing the complexity of U.S. history, the official said. In a proclamation on Monday, Biden asked all Americans to ‚Äúreflect on the deep roots of racial terror in our Nation and recommit to the work of rooting out systemic racism across our country.‚Äù His visit comes during a racial reckoning in the United States as the country‚Äôs white majority shrinks, threats increase from white supremacist groups and the country re-examines its treatment of African Americans after last year‚Äôs murder of George Floyd, a Black man, by a white Minneapolis police officer, which sparked nationwide protests. Biden, who won the presidency on the strength of Black voter support, made fighting racial inequality a key platform of his 2020 campaign and has done the same during his short tenure in the White House. The Republican governor of Florida, Ron DsSantis, has fired off another shot in the culture war by signing a bill banning transgender females from girls‚Äô sports in schools. ‚ÄúIn Florida, girls are going to play girls sports and boys are going to play boys sports,‚Äù DeSantis said, signing the bill into law at a Christian academy in Jacksonville on Tuesday. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to make sure that that‚Äôs the reality.‚Äù As the AP reports: The new law inflames an already contentious discussion as Republican-controlled states move to limit the rights of LGBTQ people. It also could impose severe financial consequences on Florida. The NCAA, which oversees college athletics, has threatened to relocate key games from states that discriminate against athletes. When the Florida legislature was considering the measure in April, the NCAA said it would commit championship games to ‚Äúlocations where hosts can commit to providing an environment that is safe, healthy and free of discrimination‚Äù. The measure approved by the GOP-led legislature takes effect 1 July. Human Rights Campaign president Alphonso David said: ‚ÄúAll Floridians will have to face the consequences of this anti-transgender legislation - including economic harm, expensive taxpayer-funded legal battles and a tarnished reputation.‚Äù Democrats and LGBTQ advocates said the law will be challenged in court. ‚ÄúThis is yet another hate-driven attack from the governor and Republican legislators, and it‚Äôs insulting that they‚Äôve staged this morning‚Äôs photo-op on the first day of Pride Month,‚Äù said state senator Shevrin Jones. ‚ÄúAt the end of the day, transgender kids are just kids.‚Äù The Florida law mirrors an Idaho law, the first of its kind when enacted last year, that is now mired in legal challenges. Republican governors in Arkansas, Mississippi and Tennessee recently signed similar measures. Here‚Äôs where the day stands so far: Joe Biden is en route to Tulsa, Oklahoma, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the city‚Äôs race massacre. The president will deliver remarks to honor the victims of the massacre and meet with survivors of the violence, which killed at least 300 African Americans in 1921. Ahead of the trip, the Biden administration announced a series of initiatives aimed at narrowing the country‚Äôs racial wealth gap. The administration pledged to take action to address racial housing discrimination and use its purchasing power to direct an additional $100 billion to small disadvantaged business owners. Biden will meet tomorrow with Republican Senator Shelley Moore Capito to discuss a potential compromise on infrastructure. The meeting comes a week after Republicans outlined their latest offer, which called for spending $928 billion on infrastructure over the next eight years, far less than what Biden has proposed. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. The Fox News host Sean Hannity was criticised for appearing at a Donald Trump rally in 2018 but according to a new book he was involved again with Trump‚Äôs campaign in 2020, helping write an ad that aired on his primetime show. Frankly, We Did Win This Election: The Inside Story of How Trump Lost, by Mike Bender, senior White House reporter for the Wall Street Journal, will be published in August. News of its contents, including ‚Äúsome amazingly hilarious revelations‚Äù about Mike Pence, Rudy Giuliani, Roger Stone, Tucker Carlson, Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump ‚Äúand the rest of the Trump posse‚Äù, was reported by Punchbowl News. According to the news site, the ad known to Trump insiders as ‚Äúthe Hannity ad‚Äù and ‚Äúthe one Hannity wrote‚Äù ran only during Hannity‚Äôs show. An anonymous Trump aide is reported as saying ‚ÄúHannity said this is our best spot yet‚Äù but Bender reports: ‚ÄúInside the campaign, the spot was mocked mercilessly ‚Äì mostly because of the dramatic, over-the-top language and a message that seemed to value quantity over quality. ‚ÄúDonald Trump himself, in a post-election interview with Bender, did not dispute that Hannity wrote the ad, which called [Joe] Biden a ‚Äò47-year swamp creature‚Äô who had ‚Äòaccomplished nothing‚Äô and supported a ‚Äòradical, socialist Green New Deal‚Äô.‚Äù Hannity denied writing the ad, telling Bender: ‚ÄúThe world knows that Sean Hannity supports Donald Trump. But my involvement specifically in the campaign ‚Äì no. I was not involved that much. Anybody who said that is full of shit.‚Äù Joe Biden is now en route to Tulsa, Oklahoma, where he will commemorate the 100th anniversary of the city‚Äôs race massacre. The president did not stop to take questions from reporters as he boarded Air Force One for the trip to Tulsa, where he will meet with massacre survivors and deliver remarks to honor the victims of the violence. The Washington Post has obtained more than 800 pages of emails to and from Anthony Fauci, the senior US health official who is now chief medical adviser to President Joe Biden, during the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic last year. The paper reports that the emails offer a window into the chaos, panic and confusion of the time, and of the considerable difficulties Fauci faced as a prominent figure in a Covid task force serving Donald Trump. As Fauci recently told the Post, ‚ÄúI was getting every single kind of question, mostly people who were a little bit confused about the mixed messages that were coming out of the White House and wanted to know what‚Äôs the real scoop. ‚ÄúI have a reputation that I respond to people when they ask for help, even if it takes a long time. And it‚Äôs very time consuming, but I do.‚Äù The Post obtained the emails through the Freedom of Information Act. Some exchanges are with George Gao, a top Chinese health official. ‚ÄúLets work together to get the virus out of the earth,‚Äù Gao says in one message. ‚ÄúWe will get through this together,‚Äù Fauci replies. US-China tensions have been high throughout the pandemic but the US is now investigating whether the virus, discovered in Wuhan province, came from animals, as has been the scientific community‚Äôs position for some time, or whether there is truth to the theory that the virus was being studied in a laboratory and escaped. In a column for the Guardian on Tuesday, the author Thomas Frank said that if true, the laboratory leak theory ‚Äúis the kind of thing that could obliterate the faith of millions‚Äù of Americans who have followed government advice throughout the pandemic. In another exchange between Fauci and Gao, the Chinese official refers to ‚Äúsome news (hope it is fake) that [you] are being attacked by some people. Hope you are well under such [an] irrational situation‚Äù. ‚ÄúThank you for your kind note,‚Äù Fauci replies. ‚ÄúAll is well despite some crazy people in this world.‚Äù Fauci was often at odds with Trump and others who sought to play down the severity of the threat to US public health. The scientist ended up having to hire security. Here‚Äôs our own interview with Fauci, published yesterday: Joe Biden is ‚Äúfinishing the job‚Äù begun by Barack Obama, the former president told the New York Times in an interview released on Tuesday. ‚ÄúI think that what we‚Äôre seeing now, is Joe and the administration are essentially finishing the job,‚Äù Obama said. ‚ÄúAnd I think it‚Äôll be an interesting test. ‚ÄúNinety per cent of the folks who were there in my administration, they are continuing and building on the policies we talked about, whether it‚Äôs the Affordable Care Act or our climate change agenda and the Paris [climate deal], and figuring out how do we improve the ladders to mobility through things like community colleges.‚Äù Obama also mused about Biden‚Äôs much-discussed ability to reach voters, particularly in post-industrial midwestern states, who voted Obama then switched to Donald Trump. ‚ÄúBy virtue of biography and generationally,‚Äù Obama said, his vice-president, who is 78 and was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, ‚Äúcan still reach some of those folks‚Äù. ‚ÄúPeople knew I was left on issues like race, or gender equality, and LGBTQ issues and so forth,‚Äù Obama said. ‚ÄúBut I think maybe the reason I was successful campaigning in downstate Illinois, or Iowa, or places like that is they never felt as if I was condemning them for not having gotten to the politically correct answer quick enough, or that somehow they were morally suspect because they had grown up with and believed more traditional values.‚Äù In fact Obama famously stirred controversy in 2008 when he said such voters ‚Äúget bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren‚Äôt like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations‚Äù. The New York Times interviewer did not raise those remarks. Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell once again defended Republicans‚Äô decision to block the bill to create a bipartisan commission to study the January 6 insurrection. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think anybody‚Äôs going to get away with anything,‚Äù the Republican leader said in Kentucky today. ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôll know everything we need to know. We were all witnesses, we were right there when it happened. And I simply think the commission is not necessary.‚Äù McConnell‚Äôs comments come four days after Senate Republicans blocked the commission bill from being taken up for debate, killing the legislation for now. Six Republicans joined their Democratic colleagues in voting to advance the bill, but Democrats needed 10 Republican votes to overcome a filibuster of the legislation. Alexandra Villareal reports for the Guardian: Republicans in Texas are already plotting to resurrect their fight for sweeping voting restrictions after Democratic lawmakers walked out of the state capitol and blocked an 11th-hour attempt to ram through legislation that would have made it harder to cast a ballot. The Texas governor, Greg Abbott ‚Äì who leads the state‚Äôs domineering Republican majority ‚Äì has announced he will include the high-stakes issue on his agenda when he reconvenes the legislature for a rapid-fire special session. He called the failure of the bill ‚Äúdeeply disappointing‚Äù. Abbott, who says ‚Äúelection integrity‚Äù remains an emergency in Texas, wields control over what is essentially legislative overtime, where lawmakers consider issues on a sped-up timeline. When the session will begin remains unclear. But advocates are still painting last night‚Äôs historic show of force as an inflection point for the Texas legislature and America, when Democrats shirked business as usual for aggressive tactics that matched the urgency of a teetering democracy. ‚ÄúThe fight you saw last night is the fight that will remain and continue,‚Äù state representative Trey Martinez Fischer, a Democrat representing San Antonio, told the Guardian. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs our commitment.‚Äù Joe Biden‚Äôs visit to Tulsa comes almost exactly one year after Donald Trump traveled to the city to hold his first campaign rally since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, an event that sparked intense criticism and attracted protests. The AP notes: After suspending his campaign rallies because of the coronavirus pandemic, Trump, a Republican, chose Tulsa as the place to mark his return. But his decision to schedule the rally on June 19, the holiday known as Juneteenth that commemorates the end of slavery in the United States, was met with such fierce criticism that he postponed the event by a day. The rally was still marked by protests outside and empty seats inside an arena downtown. Trump arrived in Tulsa during a highly charged moment, days after he had ordered the forcible clearing of Lafayette Square across from the White House, with federal officers pushing out those peacefully protesting [George] Floyd‚Äôs death. Trump reflexively embraced law enforcement throughout his presidency and was frequently accused of using racist rhetoric when painting apocalyptic ‚Äî and inaccurate ‚Äî scenes of American cities. While in Oklahoma today, Joe Biden will meet with survivors of the Tulsa race massacre and visit the Greenwood Cultural Center. The center describes itself as ‚Äúthe keeper of the flame for the Black Wall Street era, the events known as the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, and the astounding resurgence of the Greenwood District in the months and years following the tragedy‚Äù. The Guardian‚Äôs Sam Levine reports: Conservative activists across America are pushing efforts to review the 2020 vote more than six months after the election, a move experts say is a dangerous attempt to continue to sow doubt about the results of the 2020 election that strikes at the heart of America‚Äôs democratic process. Encouraged by an ongoing haphazard review of 2.1m ballots in Arizona, activists are pushing to review votes or voting equipment in California, Georgia, Michigan, and New Hampshire. Meanwhile, in Wisconsin, the powerful speaker of the state house of representatives recently hired ex-law enforcement officers, including one with a history of supporting Republicans, to spend the next three months investigating claims of fraud. At least one of the officers hired has a history of supporting GOP claims. The announcement also came after state officials announced they found just 27 cases of potential fraud in 2020 out of 3.3m votes cast. The reviews are not going to change the 2020 election results or find widespread fraud, which is exceedingly rare. Nonetheless, the conservative activists behind the effort ‚Äì many of whom have little election experience ‚Äì have championed the reviews as an attempt to assuage concerns the 2020 election was stolen. If the probes don‚Äôt turn up anything, they will only serve to increase confidence in elections, proponents say. Joe Biden also released a statement yesterday to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Tulsa race massacre, calling on Americans to ‚Äúrecommit‚Äù to efforts to address systemic racism in the US. ‚ÄúOn this solemn centennial of the Tulsa Race Massacre, I call on the American people to reflect on the deep roots of racial terror in our nation and recommit to the work of rooting out systemic racism across our country,‚Äù Biden said in the statement. The president noted that the federal government ‚Äúmust reckon with and acknowledge the role that it has played in stripping wealth and opportunity from Black communities‚Äù. The Biden administration announced today a series of initiatives aimed at narrowing the racial wealth gap in the US, including efforts to support affordable housing and minority-owned small businesses. Reflecting on the lives and businesses lost in Tulsa in 1921, Biden said yesterday, ‚ÄúWe honor the legacy of the Greenwood community, and of Black Wall Street, by reaffirming our commitment to advance racial justice through the whole of our government, and working to root out systemic racism from our laws, our policies, and our hearts.‚Äù The full-page advert in a special Black History edition of USA Today presents a technicolor vision of modern-day Tulsa, with sparkling images of public parks and brightly-painted murals celebrating the local Black community under the banner headline: ‚ÄúTulsa Triumphs‚Äù. ‚ÄúTulsa is leading America‚Äôs journey to racial healing,‚Äù the text says, inviting visitors from across the US to sample the delights of Oklahoma‚Äôs second-largest city. The enticements include ‚Äúan emotional opportunity for learning and reflection‚Äù and a ‚Äúspace for reconciliation‚Ä¶ Tulsa triumphs, and you can be a part of this pilgrimage.‚Äù The advert is a brazen attempt to turn Tulsa‚Äôs grim distinction as the setting of one of the most grotesque mass lynchings in US history into a tourist draw. It is the work of the Tulsa Race Massacre Centennial Commission, a body of prominent state and city politicians and other local notables who have put together the city‚Äôs established version of the 100th anniversary of a very special day. On that day, 31 May 1921, white Tulsans ran amok, shooting any Black person in sight, dropping incendiary devices from the air onto their homes and burning to the ground one of the most flourishing Black business districts in the country, known as ‚ÄúBlack Wall Street‚Äù. Some 35 blocks of Black real estate in the Greenwood neighbourhood were destroyed. At least 300 men, women and children were murdered. Over 24 hours, Tulsa witnessed what is thought to be the worst single event of white supremacist violence against African Americans in the nation‚Äôs history. From the terror of 31 May 1921 to the ‚Äútriumph‚Äù of 31 May 2021 ‚Äì it makes for a powerful attraction for visitors. The only hitch with this depiction of Tulsa rising from the ashes is that from the perspective of the Black survivors and many of the descendants of the massacre, it has no bearing in reality. Ahead of Joe Biden‚Äôs Tulsa trip, his administration also outlined how his American Jobs Plan will directly benefit communities of color. The president‚Äôs proposal includes a $10 billion community revitalization fund that will help fund community-led infrastructure projects and a $15 billion grant program to bolster transportation infrastructure. Biden has also called for the creation of a Neighborhood Homes Tax Credit to support the development of affordable housing and a $5 billion grant program to expand housing options for Americans with low or moderate incomes. Finally, the president has indicated he would like to invest $31 billion to expand efforts to support minority-owned small businesses. However, it is very unclear if any of these initiatives will make it into the final version of the infrastructure bill. Senate Republicans have proposed a $257 billion bill, much smaller than the $1.7 trillion infrastructure package that Biden is pushing, and it‚Äôs possible that proposals like those above may end up getting cut from the legislation. The White House has just confirmed Biden will meet with Republican Senator Shelley Moore Capito to discuss her team‚Äôs latest offer. That meeting will likely offer insight into the size and scope of the final bill. Greetings from Washington, live blog readers. Joe Biden will travel today to Tulsa, Oklahoma, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the city‚Äôs race massacre, which targeted affluent African Americans and their businesses. Ahead of the president‚Äôs trip, the White House announced this morning a series of new initiatives aimed at narrowing the country‚Äôs racial wealth gap. The administration pledged to take action to address racial housing discrimination and use its purchasing power to direct an additional $100 Billion to small disadvantaged business owners. The trip and the administration‚Äôs announcement come two weeks after three living survivors of the massacre -- Viola Fletcher, Hughes Van Ellis and Lessie Evelyn Benningfield Randle -- testified to Congress about the need to compensate massacre survivors and their descendants. ‚ÄúI am here seeking justice,‚Äù Fletcher said at the House subcommittee hearing. ‚ÄúI am here asking my country to acknowledge what happened in Tulsa in 1921.‚Äù The blog will have more details on the trip coming up, so stay tuned.","charCount":"44499","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/maanvi-singh\">Maanvi Singh</a> (now) and <a href=\"profile/joan-greve\">Joan E Greve</a> (earlier)"},{"headline":"Joe Biden calls for US to confront its past on 100th anniversary of Tulsa massacre","standfirst":"<p>President drew a through-line from racist violence in 1921 to recent displays of white supremacy in Charlottesville and the US Capitol </p>","trailText":"President drew a through-line from racist violence in 1921 to recent displays of white supremacy in Charlottesville and the US Capitol ","byline":"David Smith in Washington","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"df50bce1e8e07c30da1c3779bddebcac3531d415\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df50bce1e8e07c30da1c3779bddebcac3531d415/0_0_6192_3715/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Survivors Lessie Benningfield Randle, Viola Fletchter, and Hughes Van Ellis sing together at a rally during commemorations of the 100th anniversary of the Tulsa race massacre.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Survivors Lessie Benningfield Randle, Viola Fletchter, and Hughes Van Ellis sing together at a rally during commemorations of the 100th anniversary of the Tulsa race massacre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brandon Bell/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Joe Biden has used the centenary of the Tulsa race massacre as a rallying cry for America to be honest about its history, insisting that great nations ‚Äúcome to terms with their dark sides‚Äù.</p> <p>On Tuesday Biden became the first sitting US president to visit the site where, on 31 May and 1 June 1921, a white mob murdered up to 300 African Americans and burned and looted homes and businesses, razing a prosperous community known as ‚ÄúBlack Wall Street‚Äù.</p> <p>In an emotional speech punctuated by intense applause, Biden pleaded for America to confront its past and admit that a thread of hatred runs from Tulsa through more recent displays of white supremacy in Charlottesville, Virginia, and at the US Capitol in Washington on 6 January.</p> <p>He also drew a connection to a Republican assault on the voting rights of people of colour and announced that Kamala Harris, the first woman of colour to serve as vice-president, would lead the White House effort to resist it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c33c6343167297fe2aecdad490fb4edce52c27fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c33c6343167297fe2aecdad490fb4edce52c27fa/0_96_4755_2852/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Biden speaks at the Greenwood Cultural Center.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Biden speaks at the Greenwood Cultural Center.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Biden began by speaking directly to the last three survivors of the massacre, centenarians Viola ‚ÄúMother‚Äù Fletcher, Hughes ‚ÄúUncle Red‚Äù Van Ellis and Lessie ‚ÄúMother Randle‚Äù Benningfield Randle, who received a standing ovation from an audience of around 200 made up of survivors and their families, community leaders, and elected officials.</p> <p>‚ÄúYou are the three known remaining survivors of a story seen in the mirror dimly but no longer,‚Äù said Biden, a comparatively youthful 78. ‚ÄúNow, your story will be known in full view.‚Äù</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/31/tulsa-race-massacre-at-100-act-of-terrorism\">Tulsa race massacre at 100: an act of terrorism America tried to forget</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Knowledge of this violent attempt to suppress Black success in Greenwood, Tulsa, fell victim to a decades-long conspiracy of silence. The atrocity was not taught in schools, even in Tulsa, until the mid-2000s and was expunged from police records. Those who threatened to break to the taboo faced disapproval or death threats. Even many Black residents preferred not to burden their children with the story.</p> <p>Biden said: ‚ÄúFor much too long the history of what took place here was told in silence, cloaked in darkness. But just because history is silent it doesn‚Äôt mean that it did not take place and, while darkness can hide much, it erases nothing. Some injustices are so heinous, so horrific, so grievous, they can‚Äôt be buried, no matter how hard people try. So it is here: only with truth can come healing and justice and repair.‚Äù</p> <p>The argument was a striking contrast from his predecessor, Donald Trump, who promoted a heroic vision of American history. On the massacre‚Äôs 99th anniversary, Trump had posed with a Bible outside a historic church after security forces teargassed protesters outside the White House.

It was the neo-Nazi march in Charlottesville in 2017 that moved him to end political retirement and run for president again.</p> <p>‚ÄúWhat happened in Greenwood was an act of hate and domestic terrorism with the through-line that exists today still,‚Äù he said, prompting a cry of assent from the audience. ‚ÄúJust close your eyes and remember what you saw in Charlottesville four years ago on television.‚Äù</p> <p>Biden added that Fletcher, 107, said the 6 January insurrection, when a mob of Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol, ‚Äúbroke her heart‚Äù and ‚Äúreminded her of what happened here in Greenwood a hundred years ago‚Äù.

On Tuesday Biden became the first sitting US president to visit the site where, on 31 May and 1 June 1921, a white mob murdered up to 300 African Americans and burned and looted homes and businesses, razing a prosperous community known as ‚ÄúBlack Wall Street‚Äù. In an emotional speech punctuated by intense applause, Biden pleaded for America to confront its past and admit that a thread of hatred runs from Tulsa through more recent displays of white supremacy in Charlottesville, Virginia, and at the US Capitol in Washington on 6 January. He also drew a connection to a Republican assault on the voting rights of people of colour and announced that Kamala Harris, the first woman of colour to serve as vice-president, would lead the White House effort to resist it. Biden began by speaking directly to the last three survivors of the massacre, centenarians Viola ‚ÄúMother‚Äù Fletcher, Hughes ‚ÄúUncle Red‚Äù Van Ellis and Lessie ‚ÄúMother Randle‚Äù Benningfield Randle, who received a standing ovation from an audience of around 200 made up of survivors and their families, community leaders, and elected officials. ‚ÄúYou are the three known remaining survivors of a story seen in the mirror dimly but no longer,‚Äù said Biden, a comparatively youthful 78. ‚ÄúNow, your story will be known in full view.‚Äù Knowledge of this violent attempt to suppress Black success in Greenwood, Tulsa, fell victim to a decades-long conspiracy of silence. The atrocity was not taught in schools, even in Tulsa, until the mid-2000s and was expunged from police records. Those who threatened to break to the taboo faced disapproval or death threats. Even many Black residents preferred not to burden their children with the story. Biden said: ‚ÄúFor much too long the history of what took place here was told in silence, cloaked in darkness. But just because history is silent it doesn‚Äôt mean that it did not take place and, while darkness can hide much, it erases nothing. Some injustices are so heinous, so horrific, so grievous, they can‚Äôt be buried, no matter how hard people try. So it is here: only with truth can come healing and justice and repair.‚Äù The argument was a striking contrast from his predecessor, Donald Trump, who promoted a heroic vision of American history. On the massacre‚Äôs 99th anniversary, Trump had posed with a Bible outside a historic church after security forces teargassed protesters outside the White House. He headed to Tulsa later that month for a campaign rally that breached coronavirus safety guidelines. After studying an exhibition on this lost ‚Äúboom town‚Äù at the Greenwood Cultural Center, Biden‚Äôs message appeared to be the opposite of ‚ÄúMake America great again‚Äù ‚Äì an acknowledgment that America‚Äôs history includes slavery and segregation, and that only looking that fully in the face can allow it to move forward. Challenging the language used to describe the one of the worst chapters in the country‚Äôs history of racial violence, the president followed a moment of silence with a pointed statement: ‚ÄúMy fellow Americans, this was not a riot. This was a massacre.‚Äù The hush gave way to prolonged applause inside the room. He went on: ‚ÄúAmong the worst in our history. But not the only one and for too long, forgotten by our history. As soon as it happened, there was a clear effort to erase it from our memory, our collective memory‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt just choose to learn what we want to know and not what we should know,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúWe should know the good, the bad, everything. That‚Äôs what great nations do. They come to terms with their dark sides. And we‚Äôre a great nation.‚Äù The president noted that, while Greenwood‚Äôs Black community recovered, it was marginalised again by housing ‚Äúred lining‚Äù and urban renewal projects including highways ‚Äì a pattern seen in many American cities. He promised that his administration would address racism at its roots, expanding federal contracting with small, disadvantaged businesses, investing tens of billions of dollars in communities like Greenwood and pursuing new efforts to combat housing discrimination. Notably, Biden also used the platform to condemn efforts in recent months by Republican state legislators to impose voting restrictions ‚Äì likely to have a disproportionate impact on people of colour ‚Äì as a ‚Äútruly unprecedented assault on our democracy‚Äù. Biden said he had asked Harris to lead his administration‚Äôs efforts to protect voting rights. ‚ÄúWith her leadership and your support, we‚Äôre going to overcome again, but it‚Äôs going to take a hell of a lot of work,‚Äù he said. Harris released a statement that noted almost 400 bills have been introduced at the state level since the last presidential election to make it more difficult for some people to vote. ‚ÄúThe work ahead of us is to make voting accessible to all American voters, and to make sure every vote is counted through a free, fair, and transparent process,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThis is the work of democracy.‚Äù Biden has made numerous policy speeches as president but the convergence of history, racial justice and the audience on Tuesday seemed to strike a particular chord in him. It was the neo-Nazi march in Charlottesville in 2017 that moved him to end political retirement and run for president again. ‚ÄúWhat happened in Greenwood was an act of hate and domestic terrorism with the through-line that exists today still,‚Äù he said, prompting a cry of assent from the audience. ‚ÄúJust close your eyes and remember what you saw in Charlottesville four years ago on television.‚Äù Biden added that Fletcher, 107, said the 6 January insurrection, when a mob of Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol, ‚Äúbroke her heart‚Äù and ‚Äúreminded her of what happened here in Greenwood a hundred years ago‚Äù. He noted that hate crimes continue to target Asian Americans and Jewish Americans. ‚ÄúHate‚Äôs never defeated. It only hides. It hides. And given just a little bit of oxygen by its leaders, it comes out from under the rock like it‚Äôs happening again, as if it never went away. So folks, we must not give hate a safe harbour.‚Äù","charCount":"6212","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/davidsmith\">David Smith</a> in Washington"},{"headline":"Australia‚Äôs winter weather forecast points to warmer conditions as La Ni√±a flicks switch to neutral ","standfirst":"<p>BoM predicts higher than average minimums across the country and more rainfall than usual across northern and eastern Australia</p>","trailText":"BoM predicts higher than average minimums across the country and more rainfall than usual across northern and eastern Australia","byline":"Donna Lu","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c60aa428d2098fa11e21fa4292ebb74b14649af7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c60aa428d2098fa11e21fa4292ebb74b14649af7/0_150_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sydney runner looking to beach\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Australia‚Äôs winter weather is expected to be warmer than average and wetter in the north and east.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brook Mitchell/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Australia is facing a warmer than average winter across most of the country, according to the Bureau of Meteorology‚Äôs <a href=\"http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/outlooks/#/overview/summary/\">annual winter outlook</a>.</p> <p>It predicts higher than average minimum temperatures across Australia, with maximum temperatures in northern, south-eastern and south-western Australia also likely to be higher than average.</p> <p>The bureau has forecast more winter rainfall than usual across northern and eastern Australia.</p> <p>Dr Naomi Benger, a climatologist at the bureau, said above-average sea surface temperatures in the Indian Ocean are driving extra moisture over much of the country.</p> <p>‚ÄúCertainly, there are many farmers who would really appreciate that rainfall,‚Äù Benger said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/may/24/fire-money-how-indigenous-land-management-is-transforming-arnhem-land\">Fire money: how Indigenous land management is transforming Arnhem Land </a> </p> </aside>  <p>‚ÄúIn northern parts of the country, at this time of year, they have their dry season, which means it only takes very little rainfall to actually exceed their median.‚Äù</p> <p>Despite the expected winter rainfall, according to the Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre‚Äôs <a href=\"https://www.bnhcrc.com.au/hazardnotes/97\">winter outlook</a>, significant vegetation growth in the Northern Territory ‚Äì the result of a bumper wet season ‚Äì may lead to above-normal fire risk in parts of the Top End.</p> <p>Some parts of southern Australia will be drier than usual, including in southern Western Australia and western Tasmania, where neutral to dry conditions are expected.</p> <p>This is consistent with data from the past two decades showing a trend towards drier conditions in autumn and early winter. ‚ÄúFor southern Australia, we‚Äôve seen a decrease around 10 to 20% in wet season rainfall ‚Äì that‚Äôs April to October,‚Äù said Benger.</p> <p>‚ÄúOf course, some parts have seen very wet conditions [this autumn],‚Äù she said.

The changes, which Emily describes as an ‚Äúearthquake‚Äù, appear concentrated in RTHK‚Äôs public affairs division, home to more historically ‚Äúrebellious‚Äù programs, such as the canned satirical show Headliner, and current affairs program Hong Kong Connection. In a statement, RTHK management said three episodes of Hong Kong Connection, Hong Kong Stories, and LegCo Review ‚Äúwere not impartial, unbiased and accurate‚Äù, and were cancelled because they had been made before the vetting system was in place, and ‚Äúcould not be rectified before production‚Äù. Hong Kong Connection has won multiple awards this year, including for an episode investigating police involvement in the notorious Yuen Long subway attacks. The morning after the show won one of the awards, a producer, Bao Choy, was convicted and fined for accessing a publicly available database as part of her investigative work for the episode. The pervasive assumption is that Apple Daily, the pro-democracy tabloid owned by jailed media tycoon and government critic Jimmy Lai, is next in line. Apple Daily‚Äôs editor in chief, Ryan Law, told Agence France-Presse recently he was facing ‚Äúthe greatest crisis since I took up the post over three years ago‚Äù. As well as the prosecution of Lai, freezing of his assets, and raids on the newsroom, Hong Kong‚Äôs police commissioner has accused Apple Daily of creating hatred and dividing society, while pro-Beijing media has called for it to be shut down. An Apple Daily employee, Andy*, says: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôve been ‚Ä¶ rumours we might be shut down before July, some say maybe before the election in September or the end of the year. We simply don‚Äôt know what to believe.‚Äù Lai recently wrote to his staff from prison, telling them to stay strong but to also take care ‚Äì journalism was now a far more dangerous job. ‚ÄúIt definitely affects the morale here,‚Äù Andy says. ‚ÄúNot many of us have a personal relationship with Mr Lai but we all know he‚Äôs the icon of Apple Daily.‚Äù ‚ÄòCorrecting‚Äô the media Government powers over the media are increasing, with the national security law (NSL) imposed last year, and a vaguely defined proposed law against ‚Äúfake news‚Äù, which critics say government and police will be allowed to define. ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre at the early stage of their move to so-called correct the media scene,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAlso Carrie Lam has promised to improve the media system ‚Äì that implies there are other things, in say regulating the media.‚Äù Lam and her government maintain they respect press freedom and that Hong Kong‚Äôs press will not be targeted if they don‚Äôt break the law, but the lack of clearly defined offences in the NSL, and police raids on Apple Daily and Stand News have created a well-documented chilling effect. ‚ÄúBeijing and the Hong Kong government hold all the cards,‚Äù says Apple Daily‚Äôs Andy. ‚ÄúThey have the legal means, the financial resources, to take over the scene of media. ‚ÄúThose they can control they control, those they can‚Äôt control they use brute force or put fear into.‚Äù In response to questions, RTHK denied there was a ban on Tiananmen anniversary coverage, and said there was no intention to have the broadcaster do the same work as the government information office, and that all editorial decisions were in the hands of the broadcaster‚Äôs director, Li. ‚ÄúAccording to the charter, RTHK is editorially independent and is immune from commercial, political and/or other influences. The producers‚Äô guidelines stipulates that ‚Äòthere can never be editorial autonomy without responsibility, freedom without restraint‚Äô,‚Äù a spokesperson said. A government spokesperson did not answer questions about how ‚Äúfake news‚Äù would be defined, instead saying any law enforcement actions taken are based on evidence and according to the law, with no relation to someone‚Äôs political stance, background or occupation. ‚ÄúIt would be contrary to the rule of law to suggest that people or entities of certain sectors or professions could be above the law.‚Äù For Emily at RTHK, her eyes are on this week. On Thursday last week the government banned the vigil for the second year ‚Äì ostensibly because of the pandemic, but it‚Äôs likely people will mark it anyway, and media will try to cover it, because that‚Äôs their job. ‚ÄúI think June 4 is the point where we‚Äôll see the death of the media: if no one can go to the memorial or if those who report will be arrested or punished, then we‚Äôll understand the freedom is gone.‚Äù","charCount":"8104","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/helen-davidson\">Helen Davidson</a> in Taipei"},{"headline":"Key species at risk if planet heats up by more than 1.5C, report finds","standfirst":"<p>WWF report finds puffins, penguins and many other species will face issues such as habitat loss and food insecurity</p>","trailText":"WWF report finds puffins, penguins and many other species will face issues such as habitat loss and food insecurity","byline":"Fiona Harvey Environment correspondent","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c4f52a1dee8bdd33bf5b65bdf3459d7ffe2dd505\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c4f52a1dee8bdd33bf5b65bdf3459d7ffe2dd505/0_218_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gentoo penguins at the Argentinian research base Esperanza in Antarctica.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gentoo penguins at the Argentinian research base Esperanza in Antarctica.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Abbie Trayler-Smith/Greenpeace</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Corals will bleach, penguins will lose their Antarctic ice floes, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/29/climate-crisis-factor-tufted-puffins-die-off-study-says-bering-sea\">puffins</a> around the UK coast will be unable to feed their young, and the black-headed squirrel monkey of the Amazon could be wiped out if the world fails to limit global heating to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/08/global-warming-must-not-exceed-15c-warns-landmark-un-report\">1.5C above pre-industrial levels</a>.</p> <p>Beyond a 1.5C rise, many species will face increasing problems finding food or surviving, according to a report from WWF on the effects of climate breakdown on 12 key species across the world.</p> <p>In the UK, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/20/a-world-without-puffins-the-uncertain-fate-of-the-much-loved-seabirds\">puffins</a> are facing increasing threats from warming seas.

The Home Office said the call for evidence would help to better understand the scale of the problem, the criminal justice system‚Äôs response to it and the impact that such incidents have on the industry. The National Action Plan for the Safety of Journalists in the UK was formed after the government received reports of journalists facing abuse and attacks while going about their daily work ‚Äì including being ‚Äúpunched, threatened with knives, forcibly detained, and subjected to rape and death threats‚Äù ‚Äì and hopes to implement measures to tackle the problem. The Home Office has pledged more training for police officers and said it would seek commitments from social media companies and prosecutors to take tougher action against perpetrators. The national action plan held its first meeting last July and has representatives from government, journalism, policing, prosecution services and civil society, including the minister for safeguarding, Victoria Atkins. She said: ‚ÄúJournalists play a vital role in our democracy and should be free to do their jobs without fear of abuse, violence and intimidation. ‚ÄúThreats, including via social media, can have a devastating impact on mental and physical health and affect a journalist‚Äôs ability to report important stories for us all. ‚ÄúThis is unacceptable and I encourage members of the media to come forward and report their experiences so we can better understand the scale of the problem and protect them from harm.‚Äù The consultation comes after a spate of incidents in which reporters have been subjected to abuse. Last week a man was given a hospital order after telling a camera crew he would ‚Äúshoot everyone at the BBC‚Äù because they were ‚Äúlinked to satanic child abuse‚Äù. Russell Rawlingson, 52, verbally abused journalist Sima Kotecha and her colleagues in May last year shortly before she was due to broadcast live from Leicester city centre. He was sent to a medium secure hospital under section 37 of the Mental Health Act for harassing the journalist, as well as separate matters of having a bladed article in a public place, assaulting an emergency worker and using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intent to cause fear or provoke violence. Leicester crown court heard Rawlingson has bipolar affective disorder which requires daily medication. In March, Tommy Robinson was handed a temporary stalking prevention order against the Independent‚Äôs home affairs correspondent, Lizzie Dearden, and her boyfriend, Samuel Partridge. The English Defence League founder threatened to falsely accuse Partridge of being a paedophile in a bid to squash a negative story about him, a court heard. The court also heard Robinson went to their home in south-east London on 17 January, days after a request for comment through his solicitors‚Äô firm about a story alleging he misused money donated by his supporters. Media minister John Whittingdale said: ‚ÄúEvery time a journalist is abused, either online or offline, it is an attack not just on the individual but also on our society, which needs reliable and fact-based reporting more than ever. ‚ÄúWe want to hear from any member of the media who has ever felt unsafe doing their job so we can give those who play such a vital role in democracy the respect and protection they deserve.‚Äù Evidence can be submitted from 12.15am on Wednesday.","charCount":"3514","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/nadeembadshah\">Nadeem Badshah</a>"},{"headline":"Pupils to be offered 100m hours of tuition in Covid catch-up plan","standfirst":"<p>Government‚Äôs ¬£1.4bn programme of tutoring courses won‚Äôt be enough, warns its education recovery tsar</p>","trailText":"Government‚Äôs ¬£1.4bn programme of tutoring courses won‚Äôt be enough, warns its education recovery tsar","byline":"Peter Walker and Rachel Hall","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"56d4fb84fe65aebaae83e26c12216685dfc0be2c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/56d4fb84fe65aebaae83e26c12216685dfc0be2c/0_167_5128_3078/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Teenage student with tutor.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The money will be spent on 6m sets of tutoring courses for disadvantaged pupils and an expansion of help for 16- to 19-year-olds.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Parker Lee/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p><strong><br></strong>Pupils will be offered an extra 100m hours of tuition under post-pandemic catch-up plans unveiled today ‚Äì but the government faced immediate criticism of the ¬£1.4bn programme, with its own tsar warning ‚Äúmore will be needed‚Äù.</p> <p>After months of unprecedented school closures, ¬£1.4bn will be spent on up to 6m sets of 15-hour tutoring courses for disadvantaged pupils as well as an expansion of an existing fund for helping 16- to 19-year-olds with subjects such as English and maths, the Department for Education (DfE) said.</p> <p>There is also provision for extra training and support for teachers, and funding to allow some year-13 students to repeat their final year if it was badly affected by the pandemic.</p> <p>It gave no immediate verdict on mooted plans to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/jun/01/school-day-in-england-could-be-extended-in-covid-catch-up-proposals\">extend schools days</a> by 30 minutes.

Australia and Indonesia were the biggest exporters of coal for making steel and burning in power stations, together accounting for 59% of the world‚Äôs seaborne coal market. When countries report their national emissions to the United Nations, only fossil fuels burned domestically are counted. But the impacts of the CO2 on the climate are the same, whether they are burned in Australia or overseas. Earlier this week the government‚Äôs latest emissions data showed greenhouse gas emissions had dropped to a 30-year low of 499Mt of CO2e, thanks mostly to the Covid-19 pandemic and increasing amounts of renewable energy replacing coal. But the new data, compiled by the UK-based pro-renewables thinktank Ember, says emissions from Australian coal burned overseas released 895Mt of CO2 into the atmosphere, with 460Mt of that coming from coal used in power stations. Australia has been coming under increasing international and domestic pressure to announce more ambitious climate targets ahead of the next major climate talks in Glasgow in November. At the same time, state governments continue to release and promote more fossil fuel extraction despite an International Energy Agency report warning that new projects need to halt if the world is to have a chance to keep global heating to 1.5C Ember analyst Nicolas Fulghum said that while profits from coal exports flowed to exporting countries, ‚Äúthe environmental impact is shipped overseas‚Äù. Eight out of the 10 largest coal ports by volume were in either Australia and Indonesia.

Hay Point in Queensland is the second-largest coal port, exporting 100Mt of coal in 2020. Australia‚Äôs top three customers for thermal coal in 2020 were Japan (67Mt), China (29Mt) and Korea (28Mt), according to the data. All three countries have pledged to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions ‚Äì Japan and Korea by 2050 and China by 2060. Bill Hare, the chief executive and senior scientist with Climate Analytics and a veteran of international climate negotiations, told the Guardian the new data was in line with his own consultancy‚Äôs research on export emissions. He said the data showed Australia was ‚Äúhighly exposed‚Äù to the impacts of planned CO2 cuts in countries currently buying the coal. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs an economic risk and a strong signal.‚Äù He said that as more people around the world started to understand the impact of Australia‚Äôs exports on the global climate, this risked further damaging the country‚Äôs already poor reputation on climate action. ‚ÄúThis is going to translate into some fundamental questions about Australia‚Äôs economy. If we‚Äôre so exposed to carbon and the global markets, that‚Äôs going to feed into a broader view of Australia‚Äôs economy as being underpinned by a reliance on fossil fuels.‚Äù He said historically Australia‚Äôs fossil fuel export industry was largely ignored during international negotiations because there were many countries that profited from fossil fuels. But he had noticed a shift at the most recent talks in Madrid in 2019 when some national delegates had started to ‚Äúpoint fingers‚Äù in frustration at major fossil fuel exporters, including Australia. ‚ÄúThese sorts of numbers won‚Äôt help Australia‚Äôs position at all‚Äù at the coming talks scheduled for Glasgow, Hare said. Australia has promised to release a long-term greenhouse gas emissions strategy before those talks. Morrison told an April climate summit hosted by the US president, Joe Biden, that future generations would ‚Äúthank us not for what we have promised but what we deliver‚Äù. Morrison has said Australia wants to reach net-zero ‚Äúas soon as we possibly can‚Äù but has resisted pressure to promise a mid-century target. The government has said it is concentrating on a technology-led response to cutting emissions, but has also pushed for a ‚Äúgas-led recovery‚Äù from the economic impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic. Australia‚Äôs coal and gas industry has complained to an ongoing parliamentary inquiry that it is finding it harder to gain financial backing and insurance for projects.","charCount":"4329","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/graham-readfearn\">Graham Readfearn</a>"}]

Jabeur gets on the board with a service hold, not that Gauff will be too concerned; she has looked rock-solid on her own serve so far. On Lenglen, Jan-Lennard Struff opens with a love hold against Diego Schwartzman. The German beat Andrey Rublev on his way here, and is a dangerous opponent. Jabeur starts the second set with a double double-fault, and Gauff claims the break with a ferocious finishing volley. It gets no better for Jabeur on the Gauff serve, her drop shots chased down and her attempted passes cut out clinically. Gauff leads 6-3, 2-0 ... Out on court 12, Dylan Alcott has won the quad wheelchair men’s singles title, beating Dutchman Sam Schroder 6-4, 6-2. It’s the Australian’s third straight French Open win, and his 14th grand slam title. Next up: Britain’s Alfie Hewett takes on Japan’s Shingo Kunieda in the men’s wheelchair final. Kunieda has won this tournament seven times before, so Hewett has his work cut out. Gauff closes out the first set in style, taking it 6-3. She lost just two points on her first serve, and three on her second, in that set. Jabeur does get a drop-shot right, a lovely effort from the back of the court. It’s a rare moment of resistance in another dominant Gauff service game; the American leads 5-2 in the first set. Up next on Lenglen it’s Diego Schwarzman, who faces Germany’s Jan-Lennard Struff. The Argentinian got to the semi-finals last year before running into Rafa Nadal, who may well be waiting in the quarter-finals this time. Time to head over to Chatrier, where Coco Gauff has made a lightning start. Having broken Jabeur in the second game, she leads 4-1 and looks dominant on serve. Jabeur is relying on drop shots to turn points in her favour; it’s not working so far. Krejcikova is having quite the fortnight in Paris; she’s into the quarter-finals in the singles and doubles. “I hope you’ve been entertained,” she tells an appreciative crowd. She insists it was a close game despite the scoreline. “It’s always fun to play here ... I’m looking forward to playing another one.” Krejcikova finds her first ace, then scraps her way to match point. Stephens saves the first, but the Czech takes her next opportunity with another dominant rally. Gauff opens with a comfortable service hold on Chatrier, while Stephens takes the first two points as Krejcikova looks to serve out the match ... It looks as though Krejcikova will be waiting in the quarters for either Gauff or Jabeur; the Czech is cruising to victory over Sloane Stephens, whose unforced error count has crept over 20. Stephens tries to mix it up with a couple of nice drop shots, but as soon as she’s drawn into a rally there looks only one winner. Krejcikova breaks again, and will serve for the match. Coco Gauff walks out onto Chatrier, where she will take on Tunisia’s Ons Jabeur. Gauff won the 2018 juniors’ title here, and is targeting a first grand slam quarter-final place as a professional. Stephens’ serve is unravelling under the pressure, and Krejcikova breaks again with a punchy winner into the corner. She leads 6-2, 3-0 and this one looks over after less than an hour on court. There’s no early second-set dip from Krejcikova, who immediately breaks Stephens, then backs it up with a hold. She’s been very consistent in the longer rallies, forcing Stephens to take on risky shots that she’s not making. Krejcikova wins the first set, 6-2! Stephens holds serve comfortably but can’t make inroads as Krejcikova serves for the net. She tries a little too hard, sending two ambitious efforts into the tramlines, and Krejcikova wraps up the first set with a fine, angled volley. Stephens gets a break point but unforced errors keep costing her, as she nets twice in a row. Krejcikova dominates the next rally, and it’s 5-1. Krejcikova is an accomplished doubles player, winning multiple slams in the women’s and mixed events. She’s now making strides on the singles tour, reaching the final in Dubai, winning in Strasbourg and eliminating Elina Svitolina in the last round here. Krejcikova makes it a double break, holding steady and waiting for the erratic Stephens to blink. She sends a forehand long, and it’s 4-1 to her opponent in the first set. A very solid start from Krejcikova, who has found her rhythm quickly. She breaks after a marathon opening game, then follows up with a hold to love. Sunday saw Serena Williams and Roger Federer bow out, with Federer withdrawing before his fourth-round match against Matteo Berrettini. Ons Jabeur and Coco Gauff will begin at 11am (BST), but over on Suzanne-Lenglen, play has already started. Sloane Stephens, a former finalist here who has slipped down the rankings, is taking on world No 33 Barbora Krejcikova in a battle between two unseeded players. Court Philippe-Chatrier [25] Ons Jabeur v Coco Gauff [24] [1] Novak Djokovic v Lorenzo Musetti [3] Rafael Nadal v Jannik Sinner [18] Evening: Marta Kostyuk v Iga Swiatek [8] Court Suzanne-Lenglen Sloane Stephens v Barbora Krejcikova [10] Diego Schwartzman v Jan-Lennard Struff [4] Sofia Kenin v Maria Sakkari [17] Bonjour, tout le monde. Novak Djokovic and Rafa Nadal have successfully held off the Next Gen – but what about the Next Next Gen? Both players face teenagers today, with Djokovic up against Lorenzo Musetti before Nadal plays Jannik Sinner. Both are Italian, and both were three years old when Nadal first won the French Open in 2005. There are more slam winners in action today, in the form of Sloane Stephens (who will be on court momentarily) and Sofia Kenin, who plays Greece’s Maria Sakkari. There’s plenty of US interest, even with Serena Williams going home – not least in Coco Gauff, chasing her first slam quarter final place today. Gauff wasn’t born when Serena first won here in 2002.

AFP has the full story: Hospitals in the megacities – which have a combined population of some 40 million – were overwhelmed by a deadly Covid-19 wave in April and May, with severe shortages of oxygen and other critical medicines. The huge spike saw India report record-breaking numbers of cases and deaths to become the second worst-hit nation after the US with just under 29 million total infections. Authorities in Delhi and Mumbai, as well as other cities and states, imposed restrictions on movement and activities to combat the surge. “We have to stay safe from corona infection and also bring the economy back on track,” Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted Monday as some shops and malls reopened. Delhi Metro services were allowed to operate at 50% capacity. The northern city was reporting an average of 25,000 daily cases during its peak. It fell to 381 infections yesterday, officials said. Maharashtra, India’s richest state of which Mumbai is the capital, eased restrictions based on infection rates and hospital bed occupancy. In Mumbai, where the caseload soared to 11,163 in early April, there were just 794 new infections yesterday. Malls were allowed to reopen in the city with restrictions, but were reopened fully in cities with lower infection rates such as Nagpur and Aurangabad. India today reported just over 100,000 fresh infections – after several days of 400,000-plus cases in May – and nearly 2,500 deaths. Fiji has transformed its largest hospital into an emergency Covid-only facility, as the country reported a record number of new cases and a surge in the quick-spreading Delta variant, first identified in India. AFP has the story: The South Pacific island nation went a full year without recording any new community cases until April, when it was hit by a second wave of infections. Since then, numbers have steadily increased, with 83 new cases announced last night, bringing the total to 489 active infections. The surge has posed a challenge to Fiji’s under-developed health care system. Permanent secretary for health James Fong said 11 of the new cases were from unknown sources, raising the prospect of widespread community transmission in the nation of almost 930,000. “We expect more days of high numbers of confirmed cases. We sadly expect more hospitalisations as more severe cases of the disease develop,” Fong said. According to Fong, a major infection cluster was centred on Suva’s Colonial War Memorial Hospital, so it was being cordoned off and will treat only Covid-19 patients. Fiji, population 900,000, has so far administered 206,658 first doses and 4,599 second doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine nationwide. Women whose children died at UK festivals after taking drugs have urged the country’s government to support “life-saving” substance-checking services after an influential parliamentary committee warned it was concerned there would be a surge in youth drug deaths this summer without action, partly due to potentially increased risk taking after lockdown. A leading Taiwanese chip testing and packaging company has said that all its migrant employees have been suspended from working for about two weeks to contain a coronavirus outbreak. AFP has the story: At least 206 employees, mostly migrant workers, at facilities run by King Yuan Electronics Company (KYEC) in northern Miaoli county have tested positive, according to the government. The cluster is the first major outbreak in Taiwan’s semiconductor industry, which is operating at full capacity to meet a worldwide shortage of chips that power essential electronic devices. KYEC employs more than 7,000 people, including around 2,100 migrants, and counts some top international tech firms as clients, such as Intel, Qualcomm and Nvidia. KYEC said in a filing to the Taiwan stock exchange that its June output and revenue are expected to drop 30-35% due to the suspension of work. Local media raised concerns that the suspension could impact the global chip shortage as KYEC’s business is a key final step in the semiconductor supply chain. Two other tech firms in Miaoli have also reported infection clusters and suspended migrant workers. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has highlighted guidance for doctors which calls for them to avoid heparin when treating rare blood clots and low platelet counts in patients who received AstraZeneca’s or Johnson &amp; Johnson’s Covid-19 vaccines. Reuters reports that Europe’s drugs regulator, in a statement seeking to boost awareness of proper treatment, focused on guidance from the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH), which has concluded “management should be initiated with non-heparin anticoagulation upon suspicion” of vaccine-linked clotting. “For the management of suspected (thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome), especially if no local guideline is available, the taskforce recommends that healthcare professionals consider the ISTH interim guidance,” the EMA said in its statement. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening to everyone reading. It’s Mattha Busby here taking over the global coronavirus news blog from my colleague Martin Belam. I’ll be seeing you through the next few hours. Please do drop me a line on Twitter or via email (mattha.busby.freelance@guardian.co.uk) with any tips or thoughts – thanks! Police in Ireland have arrested dozens of people during clashes over three consecutive nights with rowdy crowds, raising doubts about government plans for an “outdoor summer” to curb Covid-19. Gardaí arrested 14 people in central Dublin and eight in Cork on Sunday night, bringing to more than 50 the number of people detained over the bank holiday weekend. Each evening throngs peacefully socialised outdoors, enjoying balmy weather, then clusters of young people ended up in violent confrontations with police, throwing bottles and other missiles. “Gardaí encountered significant numbers of groups of youths (teenage and younger adults) who were loitering around the city centre, not involved in outdoor dining/socialising,” said a police statement. The government has encouraged people to socialise outdoors to reduce Covid-19 transmission but large gatherings in city-centre streets, with few masks and little sign of social distancing, have dismayed health officials. City-centre businesses have complained about litter, public urinating and an intimidating atmosphere. Dublin authorities have promised to install 150 portaloo toilets and extra bins. On Monday, bars, restaurants and cafes can resume outdoor service, prompting hope this will reduce street gatherings. It is part of a wider relaxation that is allowing gyms, swimming pools and cinemas to reopen. Former British prime minister Gordon Brown has urged the G7 to act this week to make a plan to “vaccinate the world”, criticising current efforts. He told the media: “We’re not safe until everybody’s safe. It’s an act of self-interest. It’s not just an act of charity. You’ve got to have a plan to underwrite the funding, then you’ve got to get the manufacturing capacity ramped up, then you’ve got to get it in a number of different continents, and then you can vaccinate the world. It needs a plan, not just a wing and a prayer.” Spain is reopening its borders to vaccinated international travellers today, hoping to revive its tourism sector which – like everywhere in the world – has struggled severely during the pandemic. It will also allow cruise ships into its ports from today. Malta has registered no new Covid -19 cases for the first time in 11 months, but the Mediterranean island’s health minister urged people to remain careful to prevent any resurgence. Taiwan has extended its level 3 restrictions until the end of the month, as it continues to report hundreds of daily new cases, including outbreaks in aged care and among migrant worker dormitories. Police in Malaysia are using drones to detect people with high temperatures in public spaces as part of Covid prevention measures, according to local media. The Philippines will open up its vaccination drive this week to include around 35 million people working outside their homes, such as public transport staff, in a bid to help curb Covid-19 transmission and to open up the economy, officials said. India reported 114,460 new coronavirus infections on Sunday, the lowest in two months, while the death toll increased by 2,677, as parts of the country prepared to ease restrictions on movement. New Delhi and other cities are working towards allowing more businesses to operate and movement rules to be relaxed from Monday. The western state of Maharashtra, which is India’s richest and has suffered the most infections during the second wave, plans to start easing in stages a strict lockdown imposed in April. The urban population in India is getting Covid-19 shots much faster than the hundreds of millions of people living in the countryside, government data shows, reflecting rising inequity in the nation’s immunisation drive. Russia’s single-dose Sputnik Light vaccine against Covid-19 has been approved for use in the Republic of the Congo. Uganda’s president Yoweri Museveni further toughened virus curbs on Sunday night, including ordering the closure of schools, to stem a worrying rise in local transmissions. Residents of the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou will not be able to leave unless they can show that it is absolutely necessary to do so, following an outbreak of Covid-19 that has sickened dozens of people in recent days. Senegal could begin producing Covid-19 vaccines next year under an agreement with Belgian biotech group Univercells aimed at boosting Africa’s drug-manufacturing ambitions. Malta has registered no new Covid-19 cases for the first time in 11 months, but the Mediterranean island’s health minister urged people to remain careful to prevent any resurgence. “Today is the first day with zero cases since last summer,” minister Chris Fearne wrote on Twitter. “It is essential that we maintain discipline and responsibility.” Reuters report that the news came as Malta allowed bars, cinemas and theatres to reopen as part of a government timetable to progressively roll back restrictions that was announced months ago. Malta last registered zero cases on 25 July, but cases then gradually rose, to a peak at 510 in March before dropping again. They have been in single figures for weeks. The island leads the European Union in the vaccination programme, with more than half the adult population now fully vaccinated and 75% having had at least a first dose. The Times of Malta reports that as of Sunday, the country had 74 active virus cases. The official confirmation of the figures from the ministry will come at lunchtime. This is the latest from Associated Press on the situation in Guangzhou. Residents of the southern Chinese city will not be able to leave unless they can show that it is absolutely necessary to do so, following an outbreak of Covid-19 that has sickened dozens of people in recent days. Anyone who is given permission to leave must show a negative test for the virus taken in the previous 48 hours, according to rules issued by the city government that take effect Monday. The same rule applies to anyone seeking to leave the surrounding province of Guangdong. The city also is restricting indoor dining, conducting mass testing and banning residents in high-risk neighborhoods from leaving their homes. At least two districts in the city of 18 million people have been closed off entirely. Guangzhou has reported no deaths from the outbreak, but the city reported another four locally transmitted cases in the 24 hours before Monday morning, bringing its recent total to more than 100 since 21 May. While speaking of Russia, Reuters report that the single-dose Sputnik Light vaccine against Covid-19 has been approved for use in the Republic of the Congo. Russia’s daily Covid numbers are at the higher end of their usual level today. Reuters say that official figures there report there have been 9,429 new coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours, alongside a further 330 deaths. Russia’s figures have tended to be between 7,000 and 9,500 new cases every day for months now. Andrew Sparrow is back in the UK live blog hot seat today, and he’s just launched it, leading on the row over international aid cuts. He’ll be carrying Covid news there as well. I’ll be continuing here with the leading coronavirus news from around the world. Uganda’s president Yoweri Museveni further toughened virus curbs on Sunday night, including ordering the closure of schools, to stem a worrying rise in local transmissions. Schools will be closed from Monday for six weeks and most gatherings, save for weddings and funerals in small groups, were banned. Non-essential travel between districts was suspended and a 9pm to 4am curfew will remain in force until mid-July. Most shops and markets remain open, provided they comply with government health regulations, but bars remain closed. Uganda had kept its Covid-19 cases relatively low and was spared the worst of the pandemic after adopting one of Africa’s tightest lockdowns, but it eased the measures as cases dropped. However, infections have soared in recent weeks with a sharp increase in severe cases. Hospitals have been overwhelmed as all intensive care and high dependency beds are occupied, threatening to collapse the fragile healthcare system. “In this wave, the intensity of severe and critically ill Covid-19 patients, and deaths is higher than what we experienced in the first wave of the pandemic,” Museveni said in a televised address. AFP reports that Museveni explained that the east African country had recorded as many severe and critical cases of Covid-19 in a fortnight as it did in a three to four month period during the first wave. “We are concerned that this will exhaust available bed space and oxygen supply in hospitals, unless we constitute urgent public health measures,” said Museveni. The country has counted 52,935 cases of coronavirus, of which 383 have been fatal, figures believed to be undercounted as a result of low testing. The Philippines will open up its vaccination drive this week to include around 35 million people working outside their homes, such as public transport staff, in a bid to help curb Covid-19 transmission and to open up the economy, officials said. The next phase in the rollout that started in March comes after vaccines were initially targeted at health care workers, senior citizens and people with existing health conditions. Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said those eligible to join the new phase, which includes workers in the informal sector, will be able to register from Wednesday, with the country expecting more vaccines to arrive in the second half. Neil Jerome Morales reports for Reuters that the Philippines has so far received more than nine million doses, mostly supplied by China’s Sinovac Biotech, but has a long way to go to meet its goal of immunising 70 million people this year out of a population of 110 million. In order to help shore up confidence in the vaccine programme and tackle vaccine hesitancy, local celebrities were among 50 people vaccinated in an inoculation ceremony on Monday. The Philippines, which is battling one of the worst Covid-19 outbreaks in Asia, has reported 1.27 million infections and almost 22,000 deaths, with some provinces outside the capital region emerging as new hotspots for Covid-19. Taiwan has extended its level 3 restrictions until the end of the month, as it continues to report hundreds of daily new cases, including outbreaks in aged care and among migrant worker dormitories. The central epidemic command centre (CECC) has just announced 211 new cases - a drop on previous days but with a warning that testing numbers may have been lower over the weekend. An additional 26 deaths were reported. In good news, there were no new cases announced from backlogged test results, an issue that has plagued health authorities trying to analyse trends in recent weeks. Most of the new cases were in New Taipei City, with 82 recorded, plus 60 in the capital Taipei and 45 in Miaoli, where outbreaks among factory workers are causing concern, and prompting criticism of the government for failing to protect migrant worker communities – known to be a vulnerable cohort of people, after mass outbreaks in dormitories overseas during the past year. Health minister Chen Shi-chung announced new measures for when a migrant worker is found to be positive, including quarantining all close contacts. He said the labour ministry had begun inspecting the more than 1,000 dorms with more than 50 people, and was in contact with workers in need of support. He urged workers to take advantage of multilingual information apps. There are 64 aged care facilities with recorded cases, including 48 employees and more than 146 others, including residents. Chen said Moderna vaccines will start being distributed in Wednesday, prioritising vulnerable groups for a set period of time before widening the eligibility, as opposed to waiting until everyone in that group is vaccinated. A day after US senators flew to Taipei to announced a donation of 750,000 vaccines, Chen seems to be speaking very optimistically about Taiwan’s vaccination drive, which has so far reached about 3% of the population. The island has received just a few million doses, and has orders for tens of millions more, but that is reliant on the production of domestic vaccines still in trial stage and the clearance of global shortages. At the press conference he has even suggested that people may even be allowed to choose which vaccine they want if there’s enough supply in the future, according to local reporters. Senegal could begin producing Covid-19 vaccines next year under an agreement with Belgian biotech group Univercells aimed at boosting Africa’s drug-manufacturing ambitions, a source involved in funding the project told Reuters. African nations are still struggling to acquire shots. On a continent of 1.3 billion, only about 7 million people have been fully vaccinated. Univercells chief investment officer Kate Antrobus, when asked about the timeframe for the project, confirmed that it could send vaccine doses to Senegal early next year. She declined to comment on the exact date for a full vaccine production line in Senegal but of the timelines referenced she said: “I do not think they are unreasonable.” It is not clear yet what vaccine will be supplied to Senegal, but Antrobus said the site in Belgium would be able to manufacture a class of so-called viral vector Covid-19 vaccine such as those developed by Johnson &amp; Johnson, AstraZeneca, Russia’s Sputnik V and China’s Cansino. “If Covid amazingly subsides over the next year … that same capacity could be used for other viruses,” Antrobus said. Univercells also has its own Covid-19 vaccine candidate, being developed with Germany’s Leukocare and Italian firm ReiThera, which has completed phase 2 trials. It is seeking financing to carry out phase 3, which the Italian government said it is ready to fund. Talking of Sky News, former British prime minister Gordon Brown has been on this morning, urging G7 countries to come together and provide a vaccine supply for poorer nations over and above the “scratching the surface” he said was being done right now We’re not safe until everybody’s safe. It’s an act of self-interest. It’s not just an act of charity, because if the disease spreads and mutates and comes back into our country, then we all suffer, so this is something that the world has got to do together. And that’s why on Friday, when Boris Johnson meets the G7 in Cornwall, with the richest countries sitting around the table, they’ve got the chance to make a decision that will vaccinate the whole world by putting up the money that is necessary to pay for it and sharing the doses. Challenged that there were already commitments to share 100m vaccine doses from the UK, Brown retorted: That’s not a plan. You’ve got to have a plan to underwrite the funding, then you’ve got to get the manufacturing capacity ramped up, then you’ve got to get it in a number of different continents, and then you can vaccinate the world. It needs a plan, not just a wing and a prayer. If you are in the UK then there’s a familiar face back on your screens this morning – Sky News presenter Kay Burley has returned to work after being suspended for six months for breaking Covid-19 rules. Alex Green, PA Media’s entertainment reporter, reminds us that Burley was suspended from the channel in December after making “a big mistake” and “pulling” her colleagues into breaking coronavirus restrictions while celebrating her 60th birthday at a restaurant in London, which was then under tier 2 restrictions. Following an internal review in December, Sky News found that “a small number of Sky News staff attended a social event in London” where Covid-19 guidelines were breached. It said: “All those involved regret the incident and have apologised. Everyone at Sky News is expected to comply with the rules and the company takes breaches like this very seriously indeed.” The channel’s political editor, Beth Rigby, and correspondent Inzamam Rashid were also both taken off air for three months following the review. The Washington Post is leading at the moment with an overnight story that “the last mile” of the vaccination programme in the US is proving to be the hardest. They report: Plummeting vaccination rates have turned what officials hoped would be the “last mile” of the coronavirus immunization campaign into a marathon, threatening President Biden’s goal of getting shots to at least 70 percent of adults by July 4. The United States is averaging fewer than 1 million shots per day, a decline of more than two-thirds from the peak of 3.4 million in April, according to The Washington Post’s seven-day analysis, even though all adults and children over age 12 are now eligible. Small armies of health workers and volunteers often outnumber the people showing up to get shots at clinics around the country. The slowdown is national – with every state down at least two-thirds from its peak – and particularly felt across the South and Midwest. Twelve states, including Utah, Oklahoma, Montana, the Dakotas and West Virginia, have seen vaccinations fall below 15 daily shots per 10,000 residents; Alabama had just four people per 10,000 residents get vaccinated last week. Read more here: Washington Post – Vaccination rates fall off, imperiling Biden’s July Fourth goal The urban Indian population are getting Covid-19 shots much faster than the hundreds of millions of people living in the countryside, government data shows, reflecting rising inequity in the nation’s immunisation drive. In 114 of India’s least developed districts – collectively home to about 176 million people – authorities have administered just 23 million doses in total. That’s the same number of doses as have been administered across nine major cities – New Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Pune, Thane and Nagpur – which combined have half the population of the least developed districts. Reuters notes that the disparity was even stronger last month, after the government allowed private sales of vaccines for adults aged under 45 years, an offer which favoured residents of cities with larger private hospital networks. For the first four weeks of May, those nine cities gave 16% more doses than the combined rural districts, data from the government’s Co-WIN vaccination portal shows. “My friends from the city were vaccinated at private hospitals,” said Atul Pawar, a 38-year-old farmer from Satara, a rural western district of Maharashtra, India’s wealthiest state. “I am ready to pay, but doses are not available and district borders are sealed because of the lockdown.” The ministry of health and family welfare said in a statement at the weekend that reports of vaccine inequity in India were “inaccurate and speculative in nature”. “Liberalised pricing and accelerated national Covid-19 vaccination strategy ensures vaccine equity,” it said, adding that smaller cities were also getting doses like the big ones. India has administered more than 222m doses since starting its campaign in mid-January – only China and the US have administered more – but it has given the required two doses to less than 5% of its 950 million adults. Rural India is home to more than two-thirds of the country’s 1.35 billion people. While urban areas account for a disproportionately large share of the confirmed Covid-19 cases, those concerned about the spread of the virus in the countryside say statistics undercount cases in villages, where testing is less comprehensive. Police in Malaysia are using drones to detect people with high temperatures in public spaces as part of Covid prevention measures, according to local media. The drones, which can detect people’s temperatures as high as 20 metres above ground, emit a red light to alert the authorities if someone has a high reading, Bernama, Malaysia’s state news agency, reported. Malaysia entered a near total national lockdown last week in an attempt to halt rising daily infections, which had reached more than 9,000 by the end of May. Though daily cases have since fallen, the health director general, Noor Hisham Abdullah, has warned that the majority of new infections and deaths were from unknown contacts. “One of the reasons is the emergence of new variants in the community which have higher infectivity and mortality rates,” he said in a statement on Monday, urging people to stay home. Malaysian police have previously warned they will use drones to enforce earlier travel restrictions, with officers in some areas also stating they would carry out surprise home visits to ensure people were following rules.

Reuters report that officials recorded 2,419 new Covid-19 cases and 33 deaths on Monday, bringing the total to 179,886 and 1,269 fatalities. The third wave has accounted for more than 80% of total infections so far. The government aims to administer 6 million doses of locally-made AstraZeneca and imported Sinovac vaccines this month, hoping to assuage worries about the slow roll-out and supply shortages. “The government will ensure that everyone is vaccinated,” prime minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said in televised comments after he visited an inoculation centre in Bangkok. The government plans to vaccinate 70% of Thailand’s population of more than 66 million people by the end of the year. So far, 2.8 million people deemed most vulnerable, including frontline health and transport workers, have received a first dose. But the government has come under fire from opposition politicians who accuse it of complacency and an over-reliance on the locally-made AstraZeneca doses. Good morning, it is Martin Belam here taking over the live blog in London. A US public health expert has warned that though cases of Covid-19 are at their lowest rates for months and much of the country is returning to normal life, young Americans are still “a vulnerable host” for the coronavirus. Dr Richina Bicette, associate medical director at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, told CNN children were now accounting for nearly 25% of US cases. “As adults get vaccinated and become more protected and immune,” she said, “the virus is still in the community looking for a vulnerable host and pediatric patients fit that description.” Children aged 12 and above are eligible to receive the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, one of three in US use. Federal authorities will this week debate extending vaccines to children aged 11 and under. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data shows that 52% of the US population over the age of 12 has had at least one vaccine dose and 42% is fully protected. The Biden administration wants 70% of US adults to have received at least one shot by 4 July. Deaths in the US have slowed drastically, the toll a little under 590,000. But with virus variants causing problems as other countries reopen, experts have voiced concern over slowing rates of vaccination, particularly in Republican states. Reuters: India reported 114,460 new coronavirus infections on Sunday, the lowest in two months, while the death toll increased by 2,677, as parts of the country prepared to ease restrictions on movement. New Delhi and other cities are working towards allowing more businesses to operate and movement rules to be relaxed from Monday. The western state of Maharashtra, which is India’s richest and has suffered the most infections during the second wave, plans to start easing in stages a strict lockdown imposed in April. Taiwan authorities have extended level three restrictions until the end of June. The restrictions, which have closed schools, all entertainment, public and sporting venues, and limited personal gatherings, were due to expire next week but authorities have pre-emptively extended them. After living largely Covid-free, Taiwan is experiencing its worst outbreak of the pandemic, with about 11,000 total cases and more than 260 deaths – more than 90% of them since mid-April. In a statement, Taiwan’s cabinet said the outbreak “has not yet stabilised”, and they would release more details of the extension later today. First announced on 19 May, the restrictions appear to have prevented an explosion in case numbers but have not led to a decline. Daily new cases remain in the hundreds, amid concerns over the continued lack of widespread working from home, and worsening outbreaks among employees at three factories, predominately among migrant workers who mostly live in crowded dormitories. Spain is reopening its borders to vaccinated international travellers today, hoping to revive its tourism sector which – like everywhere in the world – has struggled severely during the pandemic. It will also allow cruise ships into its ports from today. The country’s health minister, Carolina Daria, said Spain was “in the process of reclaiming its global leadership in tourism”. “Spain is a safe destination,” she said. Previously Spain allowed European visitors who have a negative PCR test taken within the previous 72 hours, but from today those visitors can take a cheaper antigen test. The three biggest tourist contingents to Spain after from the UK, France and Germany, but in a potential blow to the reopening the British government has not yet removed Spain from its list of at-risk countries, meaning any holidayers will have to quarantine when they get home. According to AFP, Spain’s Malaga airport is expecting about 20 different flights on Monday morning alone, from places around Europe such as Berlin, Lille, Frankfurt and London. Hello and welcome to today’s rolling coverage of the pandemic. Here’s a quick look at developments from the last day. China has enacted mass testing and travel restrictions in Shenzhen over new cases there, while nearby Guangzhou continues to battle the country’s first outbreak of the Delta variant, first detected in India. Taiwan has extended its level 3 restrictions until the end of June, as it continues to report hundreds of new daily cases. The US has announced 750,000 vaccines will be donated to Taiwan. The UK recorded 5,341 cases on Sunday, an increase of 2,101 on last Sunday when 3,111 cases were reported. Portugal’s prime minister has criticised Britain for removing the country from the green list, allowing travellers to visit Portugal without quarantine on return. UK ministers are ‘absolutely open’ to delaying the 21 June reopening date in England if the Delta variant worsens, the health secretary said. Sunday is the first day for 12-16-year-olds in Israel to get vaccinated, after 55% of the population have so far received two doses in the country. Morocco will reopen its airports to international traffic starting from 15 June to help the return of its nationals living abroad Staff of a senate committee investigating the handling of the pandemic in Brazil have said that the Copa America football tournament should not be held amid the world’s second-deadliest outbreak and must be postponed. Uganda’s president, Yoweri Museveni, re-imposed a strict lockdown that included the closure of schools and the suspension of inter-district travel. Victorians in Australia are being warned there is no ‘magic number’ of the people getting vaccinated before future lockdowns can be avoided.","charCount":"32947","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/mattha-busby\">Mattha Busby</a> (now), <a href=\"profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a> and<a href=\"profile/helen-davidson\">Helen Davidson</a> (earlier)"},{"headline":"UK politics live news: Tory rebellion over aid spending likely thwarted as Speaker is advised against allowing vote","standfirst":"<p>Latest updates: rebels planning to stop Boris Johnson’s cuts to aid spending could be thwarted if amendment ruled out of scope of the bill<br></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/jun/07/tory-rebels-thwarted-in-bid-to-force-vote-on-uk-foreign-aid-cut\">Tory rebels await Speaker’s decision on bid to restore aid pledge</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/jun/07/uk-cuts-foreign-aid-david-davis\">UK foreign aid cuts are immoral, says David Davis</a><br></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus – latest global updates</a></li></ul>","trailText":"Latest updates: rebels planning to stop Boris Johnson’s cuts to aid spending could be thwarted if amendment ruled out of scope of the bill","byline":"Andrew Sparrow","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7044c68928e71c3d5556f9921927449805c6cbeb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7044c68928e71c3d5556f9921927449805c6cbeb/0_248_4896_2938/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A person lying inside a temporary shelter tent donated by UK aid at a refugee camp for displaced people from the minority Yazidi sect in northern Iraq.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A person lying inside a temporary shelter tent donated by UK aid at a refugee camp for displaced people from the minority Yazidi sect in northern Iraq.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eddie Gerald/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<div id=\"block-60be02d38f082e80569f8d34\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-07T11:29:03.206Z\">12.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>We’ll hear about the fate of the Tory rebel amendment on aid spending at 1.30pm, the BBC’s <strong>Laura Kuenssberg </strong>reports.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bbclaurak/status/1401862807633731584\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Decision expected 1.30 <a href=\"https://t.co/rPnEhRocGN\">https://t.co/rPnEhRocGN</a></p>&mdash; Laura Kuenssberg (@bbclaurak) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbclaurak/status/1401862807633731584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 7, 2021</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60be010d8f082ac930aecdaa\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-07T11:21:25.827Z\">12.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There will be two statements in the Commons this afternoon before the debate on the the advanced research and innovation agency bill starts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/labourwhips/status/1401825150883016705\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Two major statements from 3.30:<br><br>1.

The decision is related to the Commons concept of the “scope” of a bill.</p> <p>This is <a href=\"https://erskinemay.parliament.uk/section/5313/the%20scope%20of%20a%20bill/\">what Erskine May, the Commons procedural rule book, says about scope.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The scope of a bill represents the reasonable limits of its collective purposes, as defined by its existing clauses and schedules. In particular cases, difficult questions of judgment may arise. The scope of a bill, particularly of a bill with several purposes, may be wider than its long title, although the long title may help to determine the scope. Conversely, a bill with a single purpose may have a narrow scope even though the long title is apparently wide (for example, ‘a Bill to amend a certain Act’).</p> </blockquote> <p>Amendments are not allowed if they are out of scope.</p> <p>But deciding whether or not an amendment is within scope is not straightforward. An amendment to a clause may be inadmissible because it is not relevant to that clause, but it might be acceptable if tabled in a different form (as a new clause) because it is within the scope of the bill as a whole. And, as a bill goes through parliament, its scope can widen; one amendment may push the door open for others.</p> <p>And at least two stages are involved in deciding if an amendment is in scope. If it clearly isn’t, the clerks will not allow it to be tabled (printed<a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-02/0001/amend/ARIA_day_rep_0607.pdf\"> on the order paper)</a>. But getting an amendment onto the order paper does not mean it will be put to the vote because the Speaker takes the final decision ahead of the debate, on the advice of clerks. This morning they have reportedly told him the aid amendment is inadmissible. Their advice, like government legal advice, is strictly private, but one test is whether passing an amendment would change the nature of the whole bill.

There will be two statements in the Commons this afternoon before the debate on the the advanced research and innovation agency bill starts. The Atlantic’s Tom McTague has published a 7,000-word profile of Boris Johnson, partly based on multiple interviews with him. McTague has summarised some of his key findings in a Twitter thread starting here. People from Pakistani and Bangladeshi backgrounds have the lowest rates of receiving a second dose of Covid-19 vaccine among all ethnic minority groups in England, PA Media reports. PA says: Among people aged 70 and over, 82.4% of people from a Pakistani background with a first dose of vaccine were likely to have received a second dose by May 9, along with 82.7% of those from a Bangladeshi background. The equivalent rate for people identifying as white British is 96.3%. The figures, from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), also suggest 84.0% of people identifying as black African who had received a first dose of vaccine went on to receive a second dose, along with 87.0% of those identifying as black Caribbean. These are from the BBC’s Iain Watson with the latest he’s learnt on the fate of the Tory rebel amendment on aid spending. Covid-19 case rates are rising in more local areas of the UK than at any point since early January, with numbers increasing in almost all parts of north-west England, London and Scotland, PA Media reports. PA says: The figures come as health secretary Matt Hancock indicated ministers at Westminster were open to delaying the easing of restrictions in England scheduled for June 21, while the Scottish government has paused a relaxing of rules in parts of central Scotland. The rise in rates has yet to be mirrored by a steady increase in Covid-19 hospital cases, however, with the latest data showing patient numbers have climbed slightly to levels last seen at the end of May. Nearly three-quarters of local areas of the UK (283 out of 380) recorded a week-on-week rise in Covid-19 case rates for the seven days to 2 June. This is the highest proportion since 6 January. In just under half of these places (134), the rise was small enough to be in single figures. But a growing number of areas are recording sharp jumps in rates, some of them large enough to push them above the symbolic level of 100 cases per 100,000 people When using a seven-day average to flatten out fluctuations in the data, 256 of 380 local areas in the UK are currently recording a rise in rates - the highest number since 10 January. And this is from one of Hannah White’s colleague at the Institute for Government thinktank, Alice Lilly. These are from Hannah White, the parliament specialist at the Institute for Government thinktank and a former Commons clerk. Boris Johnson was calling some of the Tory MPs planning to rebel on the aid spending amendment asking them to back the government, the Evening Standard’s Joe Murphy reports. Andrew Mitchell, the Conservative former international development secretary who tabled the rebel amendment on aid, told Sky News that he had been told by the Speaker that no decision has yet been taken about whether it will be allowed. But Tory sources are briefing that Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, is being strongly advised that the amendment should be rejected. We have not had official confirmation yet that the rebel Tory aid amendment will not be allowed, but this is what is being briefed by reliable sources this morning. The decision is related to the Commons concept of the “scope” of a bill. This is what Erskine May, the Commons procedural rule book, says about scope. The scope of a bill represents the reasonable limits of its collective purposes, as defined by its existing clauses and schedules. In particular cases, difficult questions of judgment may arise. The scope of a bill, particularly of a bill with several purposes, may be wider than its long title, although the long title may help to determine the scope. Conversely, a bill with a single purpose may have a narrow scope even though the long title is apparently wide (for example, ‘a Bill to amend a certain Act’). Amendments are not allowed if they are out of scope. But deciding whether or not an amendment is within scope is not straightforward. An amendment to a clause may be inadmissible because it is not relevant to that clause, but it might be acceptable if tabled in a different form (as a new clause) because it is within the scope of the bill as a whole. And, as a bill goes through parliament, its scope can widen; one amendment may push the door open for others. And at least two stages are involved in deciding if an amendment is in scope. If it clearly isn’t, the clerks will not allow it to be tabled (printed on the order paper). But getting an amendment onto the order paper does not mean it will be put to the vote because the Speaker takes the final decision ahead of the debate, on the advice of clerks. This morning they have reportedly told him the aid amendment is inadmissible. Their advice, like government legal advice, is strictly private, but one test is whether passing an amendment would change the nature of the whole bill. Passing this amendment would effectively turn the advanced research and innovation agency bill into the aid spending bill, and so getting it accepted was probably always a long shot (although the MPs behind it had no incentive to admit it). The Speaker can decide to over-rule the advice he gets. John Bercow did this during the Brexit process, generating huge controversy. But when Sir Lindsay Hoyle was elected to replace him, he promised to show more respect for existing convention, and said that if he ever did divert from current procedure (as Bercow did), he would publish a statement explaining why. It is not something he has ever had to do. Here is my colleague Jessica Elgot’s story about the advice that the rebel amendment on aid spending should not be put to a vote. Here is more on the decision from the Speaker. This is from the Times’ Steven Swinford. And this is from the Telegraph’s Lucy Fisher. Boris Johnson no longer faces a Commons revolt tonight because the Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, has decided not to call the amendment on the grounds that it is outside the scope of the bill’s purpose, my colleague Jessica Elgot reports. Lisa Nandy, the shadow foreign secretary, told Sky News this morning that cutting the aid budget was not in the UK’s interests. She said: The government is making a real mistake, they’re about to go into the most important week in many, many months, the G7, with a major plank of global Britain in tatters. [Boris Johnson] could change his mind, he could reverse this, he could just admit that cutting global aid in the middle of a pandemic is the wrong thing to do. It’s short-sighted, it’s not in Britain’s interest and he could solve this very quickly. Gordon Brown, the former Labour prime minister, restated his opposition to the government’s cut in aid spending in an interview this morning. He told BBC Breakfast: It’s a life-and-death issue, we’re actually deciding who lives and who dies, particularly at this point where if we withdraw the money for vaccination it’s the equivalent of pulling away the needle from a kid or from an adult who is sick who needs the vaccination, a 90% cut, for example, in support for polio vaccination. There has been an all-party consensus, all parties, for 25 years that we need 0.7%, we need to play our role in the world by being one of the leaders in aid and, really, this is not the right time to pull things away because basically this is when the poorest countries need help most. Lucy Frazer, the solicitor general, was on the morning interview round on behalf of No 10 and, when asked about the prospect of ministers trying to “buy off” tonight’s planned rebellion by promising to restore the aid cuts next year (see 9.21am), she played down the prospect.

I am certain that there’s a majority of people who want the government to change this policy. Of course the whips do their worst. But I think they will still win. Here is my colleague Patrick Wintour’s overnight preview story. And this is what Patrick tweeted on this this morning. But that does not mean a defeat is inevitable. In fact there are three outcomes that are all quite possible. They are: 1) Ministers could “buy off” the rebels by promising to reverse the aid cut next year. They have already said that the cut (from 0.7% of national income to 0.5%) is only temporary, but there are suspicions that by this Boris Johnson means temporary in the sense that income tax was temporary when William Pitt introduced it to fund the Napoleonic War. 2) The Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, may decide not to put the amendment to a vote.

Although this would be embarrassing for Johnson, there would be two consolatory bonuses: it would stop this issue overshadowing the G7 summit later this week, and it would reinforce Johnson’s claim to be a leader championing the wishes of the public (voters overwhelmingly support the aid spending cut) in the face of obstruction from a supposedly out-of-touch parliament. There are two other outcomes that are less probable. 4) The government could push the amendment to a vote without offering any compromise - and squeak a narrow win. 5) Ministers could abandon the bill altogether. The final option is highly unlikely although, given that the only person in government who was truly committed to setting up the advanced research and innovation agency was Dominic Cummings, Johnson must find the idea tempting.

Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: The ONS publishes figures on vaccination rates amongst the over-70s by class. 10.30am: Dr Bola Owolabi, director of health inequalities for NHS England, speaks at a seminar on about vaccine confidence amongst people from African, Bangladeshi, Caribbean and Pakistani backgrounds. 12pm: Downing Street is expected to hold its daily lobby briefing. 2.30pm: Matthew Rycroft, permanent secretary at the Home Office, gives evidence to the public accounts committee about the Windrush compensation scheme. 2.30pm: Priti Patel, the home secretary, takes questions in the Commons. 2.30pm: Sir Keir Starmer gives a speech to the GMB conference. After 3.30pm: MPs begin debating the remaining stages of the advanced research and invention agency bill. The amendment requiring the government to restore the 0.7% aid spending target next year may be put to a vote before 10pm.

Any stablecoins that become “systemic” should be stable in value at all times and offer 1-to-1 redemption with a robust legal claim, the Bank says. </p> <p>Stablecoins used as money should meet equivalent standards as those provided by commercial bank money (bank deposits), it continues. Plus, any regulatory model for stablecoins should include ‘a core set of features of the current banking regime’ -- including capital requirements, liquidity requirements and support from a central bank, and a backstop to compensate depositors in the event of failure.</p> <p>The Bank says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>New forms of digital money could be preferred by the public to commercial bank deposits, but they will endure only if they can be trusted as a store of value and as an accepted means of payment.</p> <p>This means that stablecoins must promise, credibly and consistently, to be fully interchangeable with existing forms of money.

The prospect of stablecoins as a means of payment and the emerging propositions of CBDC have generated a host of issues that central banks, governments, and society as a whole, need to carefully consider and address.</p> <p>It is essential that we ask the difficult and pertinent questions when it comes to the future of these new forms of digital money.”</p> </blockquote> <p>The Bank adds that responses to its recent discussion paper on CBDCs has identified five key issues:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Financial inclusion</strong> should be a prominent consideration in the design of any CBDC. Any CBDC should have a high degree of accessibility to people, regardless of their geographic location in the UK, age, socioeconomic status, digital skills or disability.</li> <li>A <strong>competitive CBDC ecosystem</strong> with a diverse set of participants will support innovation and offer the best chance to deliver the benefits of CBDC. Respondents agreed the Bank should provide the minimum level of infrastructure for the system to be reliable, resilient, fast and efficient. The private sector should take a leading role in responding to the needs of the end users.</li> <li>In assessing the case for CBDC, <strong>the Bank should assess whether non-CBDC payment innovations could deliver the same benefits</strong>. An assessment of the net benefits of CBDC should therefore consider to what extent they can instead be delivered by private sector proposals.</li> <li>A <strong>CBDC should seek to protect users’ privacy</strong>. Feedback from respondents has emphasised the importance that users place on having privacy in their transactions. As with existing forms of digital payments, there are important legal compliance arrangements that CBDC would need to meet, such as anti money laundering, countering the financing of terrorism and sanctions. Subject to meeting these the Bank should therefore seek to ensure that users enjoy a strong level of privacy from any transactions associated with CBDC.</li> <li>While CBDC <strong>should “do no harm” to the Bank’s ability to meet monetary and financial stability</strong>, opportunities to meet our policy objectives more effectively should also be considered in CBDC exploration. The Bank is primarily focused on possible benefits CBDC might bring for ‘payments’. It is also considering the possible opportunities that CBDC may offer for monetary and financial stability.</li> </ol> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60bdec4f8f082e80569f8b99\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-07T10:08:43.324Z\">11.08am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Serviced office group IWG warns on profits</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4e50a47e7935550d6c3ab6e39b74d02db6125e7d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e50a47e7935550d6c3ab6e39b74d02db6125e7d/0_536_2996_1798/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Office space by provider IWG in Spaces Globe Park, Marlow, Britain.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Serviced office provider IWG has already been battered by the pandemic, and the latest Covid-19 variants will mean more pain this year.</strong></p> <p>IWG warned this morning that underlying earnings for this year would be “well below” 2020’s levels, due to the emergence of new, more infections strains such as the Delta variant.<br></p> <p>IWG had been pinning its recovery hopes on the move to flexible working - where people dividing their time between home, and a desk at one of its shared workspaces. </p> <p>But as my colleague <strong>Kalyeena Makortoff</strong> reports, ongoing lockdowns and new variants are hitting IWG’s profits.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The company, formerly known as Regus, reported a<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/mar/09/office-space-iwg-loss-covid-19-hybrid-working\"> £620m annual loss</a> for 2020, when its finances were hit by social distancing rules and work from home orders resulted in empty offices.</p> <p>The UK-listed company, which is headquartered in Switzerland, reported strong recovery in some markets including the US.

This is especially the case in the sub-£800k bracket. It might take a few months to see how things pan out from July onwards. It will not be as simple as reducing asking prices, or indeed offers, by £15,000, as the Stamp Duty holiday was about sentiment as much as money and the fundamentals remain strong. </p> <p>“I don’t believe the property market is in a bubble, but it has certainly benefited from Government meddling in the form of the Stamp Duty holiday and mortgage guarantee scheme.

The FTSE 100 index is up 20 points, or 0.3%, at 7089 points, with Persimmon (+2.8%), Barratt Development (+2.3%) and Taylor Wimpey (+2%) among the top risers. The smaller FTSE 250 index is has gained 0.35%, with builders Crest Nicholson (+2.8%) and Redrow (+2.7%) among the risers. Construction stocks are a good gauge of UK economic confidence, and Halifax’s prediction that house prices will keep rising will be providing support too. Sophie Griffiths, market analyst at OANDA, says: While miners are trading lower, housebuilders are boosting the index after a stronger-than-expected increase in house prices. The Halifax house price index recorded a 1.3% MoM rise, ahead of the 1.2% forecast. European stock market have shaken off their earlier losses, with the Stoxx 600 now up 0.25%. Campaign group Positive Money have welcomed the Bank of England’s statement that stablecoins should face closer regulation if they become widely used in the UK. Simon Youel, head of policy &amp; advocacy at Positive Money, says users need to be protected from the risks of private money, but would benefit from a BoE-backed digital currency. “With the decline of cash and emergence of private digital currencies, we urgently need a new form of public money in the form of a central bank digital currency, to ensure that we aren’t surrendering the future of money to unaccountable private interests. “A central bank digital currency would open up access to our central bank to everyone, taking away the unique privileges enjoyed by private banks, and ending our reliance on them to manage our money and make payments.” “It is welcome that the Bank of England intends to regulate private digital currencies such as stablecoins to protect users. If stablecoins and cryptoassets are to function as money they should be regulated as such.” Tether, the biggest stablecoin, has a market value of over $60bn, and is pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. In May, it showed that 75% of Tethers were backed by “cash and cash equivalents”, with only 3% backed by actual cash [the FT has a great explanation here] The Bank of England has launched a discussion paper examining the complex, but fascinating, question of central bank digital money and the wider issues surrounding digital currency. And in it, the BoE says that “stablecoins” (digital tokens pegged to a traditional currency, but issued by private firms) should be regulated like payments handled by banks if they start to become widely used. But there’s no decision yet on whether the central bank will launch its own digital currency. In its discussion paper, the BoE says the use of stablecoins as money creates important issues. Any stablecoins that become “systemic” should be stable in value at all times and offer 1-to-1 redemption with a robust legal claim, the Bank says. Stablecoins used as money should meet equivalent standards as those provided by commercial bank money (bank deposits), it continues. Plus, any regulatory model for stablecoins should include ‘a core set of features of the current banking regime’ -- including capital requirements, liquidity requirements and support from a central bank, and a backstop to compensate depositors in the event of failure. The Bank says: New forms of digital money could be preferred by the public to commercial bank deposits, but they will endure only if they can be trusted as a store of value and as an accepted means of payment. This means that stablecoins must promise, credibly and consistently, to be fully interchangeable with existing forms of money. In other words, they must be anchored. This is essential for ensuring that users have the same confidence in stablecoins as commercial bank money. The BBC’s Faisal Islam has tweeted the key points too: The Bank says it hasn’t yet decided whether it will take the plunge and issue its own central bank digital currency, or CBDC (which chancellor Rishi Sunak has nicknamed ‘Britcoin’). But Governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, said the bank is considering it closely. “We live in an increasingly digitalised world where the way we make payments and use money is changing rapidly. The prospect of stablecoins as a means of payment and the emerging propositions of CBDC have generated a host of issues that central banks, governments, and society as a whole, need to carefully consider and address. It is essential that we ask the difficult and pertinent questions when it comes to the future of these new forms of digital money.” The Bank adds that responses to its recent discussion paper on CBDCs has identified five key issues: Financial inclusion should be a prominent consideration in the design of any CBDC. Any CBDC should have a high degree of accessibility to people, regardless of their geographic location in the UK, age, socioeconomic status, digital skills or disability. A competitive CBDC ecosystem with a diverse set of participants will support innovation and offer the best chance to deliver the benefits of CBDC. Respondents agreed the Bank should provide the minimum level of infrastructure for the system to be reliable, resilient, fast and efficient. The private sector should take a leading role in responding to the needs of the end users. In assessing the case for CBDC, the Bank should assess whether non-CBDC payment innovations could deliver the same benefits. An assessment of the net benefits of CBDC should therefore consider to what extent they can instead be delivered by private sector proposals. A CBDC should seek to protect users’ privacy. Feedback from respondents has emphasised the importance that users place on having privacy in their transactions. As with existing forms of digital payments, there are important legal compliance arrangements that CBDC would need to meet, such as anti money laundering, countering the financing of terrorism and sanctions. Subject to meeting these the Bank should therefore seek to ensure that users enjoy a strong level of privacy from any transactions associated with CBDC. While CBDC should “do no harm” to the Bank’s ability to meet monetary and financial stability, opportunities to meet our policy objectives more effectively should also be considered in CBDC exploration. The Bank is primarily focused on possible benefits CBDC might bring for ‘payments’. It is also considering the possible opportunities that CBDC may offer for monetary and financial stability. Serviced office provider IWG has already been battered by the pandemic, and the latest Covid-19 variants will mean more pain this year. IWG warned this morning that underlying earnings for this year would be “well below” 2020’s levels, due to the emergence of new, more infections strains such as the Delta variant. IWG had been pinning its recovery hopes on the move to flexible working - where people dividing their time between home, and a desk at one of its shared workspaces. But as my colleague Kalyeena Makortoff reports, ongoing lockdowns and new variants are hitting IWG’s profits. The company, formerly known as Regus, reported a £620m annual loss for 2020, when its finances were hit by social distancing rules and work from home orders resulted in empty offices. The UK-listed company, which is headquartered in Switzerland, reported strong recovery in some markets including the US. However, occupancy levels across the whole group were lower than expected due to “the prolonged impact of Covid-19, including continuing lockdown restrictions and the emergence of new variants of the virus in some markets”. “Accordingly, this will delay the anticipated recovery in our business and, given the operational gearing of the group, is expected to have a significant impact on the group’s results for 2021,” IWG said, adding that underlying earnings will come in “well below the level in 2020”. Shares in IWG have tumbled almost 13% this morning, to 319p, making it the biggest faller on the FTSE 250 index of medium-size firms. House prices are likely to continue rising for some time despite hitting a new record high in May, one of Britain’s biggest mortgage lenders has said. The monthly snapshot of the property market from Halifax showed a 1.3% jump in the cost of a home in May, taking the average selling price to a record £261,743 as homebuyers raced to complete purchases before the stamp duty holiday begins to run down at the end of this month. Halifax said almost £22,000 had been added to the average house price since May 2020, when the UK experienced the first easing of national lockdown restrictions, and the gradual reopening of the housing market after a temporary freeze. It marks a 9.5% annual increase, the fastest rate of growth in seven years. The report echoes similar findings from a survey by Nationwide last week, which showed prices rising 10.9% year on year, the fastest rate since August 2014. Here’s the full story: The average UK house price has jumped by more than £22,000 over the past 12 months, and by £3,000 in May alone, Halifax’s data shows. That puts the housing ladder further out of reach for many first-time buyers -- undermining the new 95% mortgage guarantee scheme launched this spring. Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, says: ‘Cheap borrowing and affordability is giving buyers more purchase power, which is pushing up prices. Lenders remain keen to lend and have plenty of cash to do so, resulting in ever-lower mortgage rates from sub-1 per cent. However, lenders aren’t only targeting those with big deposits or similar levels of equity in their homes, with options also increasing for first-time buyers at 95 per cent loan-to-value and the first properties being sold under the government’s First Homes initiative. This is just as well given that rising property prices are not good news for first-time buyers, and will make getting on the housing ladder even more of a struggle.’ Here’s Bloomberg’s take on the UK housing boom: U.K. house prices grew at their strongest pace in almost seven years as consumers unleashed pent-up savings to gain more space after coronavirus lockdowns, Halifax Building Society said. Prices grew 1.3% in May, driving the annual pace of growth to 9.5%, the mortgage lender said in a statement on Monday. That put the average cost of a home at £261,743 ($369,895). The report confirmed findings of Nationwide Building Society, which also showed prices growing at the fastest since 2014. The market is benefitting from a temporary tax-break on property purchases, a buildup in savings by consumers and confidence in recovery from the virus. Covid-19 travel restrictions might also keep house prices hot this summer, reckons Lucy Pendleton, property expert at independent estate agents James Pendleton. The housing market usually takes a breather over the summer months, as some potential buyers head off on holiday. But this year, most popular overseas destinations are the UK’s ‘amber’ or ‘red’ lists (meaning arrivals must quarantine), and France is restricting non-essential travel from the UK altogether. So more people will be at home...and perhaps looking to move house instead. Pendleton says: “The inability of Britons to go on holiday means there’s no distraction now from executing that ambitious move to a larger home. We’re entering a time of year when school holidays and foreign trips normally force the market to drop to a slightly slower pace. “That’s not necessarily going to happen this year and sustained, strong demand over the next few months could have ramifications when the market cools in the autumn, delivering on paper what might look like a more rapid slow down. She also argues that the relatively sluggish figures for London (annual growth of 3.1%) don’t tell the full story. House price growth in the capital is not exceptional as a whole, but it is still being powered by the same race for space that is driving the national market. Many buyers just can’t get what they want within budget after a relatively strong decade of gains. Location has become less important and space more so. UK estate agents predict that the housing market might cool slightly after May’s boom, as the stamp duty freeze is being reduced at the end of the month (from £500k to £250k). Guy Gittins, CEO of Chestertons saw “exceptional transaction volume” in May with three times more buyers than usual, and viewings running at a 5-year high for the past three months. As the Stamp Duty Holiday threshold drops to £250,000 from 30 June to 30 September and then returns back to normal levels from 1 October, we predict new buyer registrations to slightly decrease.” George Franks, co-founder of London-based estate agents, Radstock Property, says the government’s ‘meddling’ has pumped up prices. “May was a month of two halves. The first half was extremely busy as there was still a chance to purchase before the June Stamp Duty deadline. The second half of May and first week of June have been quieter, perhaps due to sunny weather, half term or everyone fleeing to Portugal. More likely, though, it is because there is no urgency as people have resigned themselves to missing the Stamp Duty deadline. “Buyers now appear to be waiting to see what happens to the market after the end of June, possibly in the hope that prices will start to fall. This is especially the case in the sub-£800k bracket. It might take a few months to see how things pan out from July onwards. It will not be as simple as reducing asking prices, or indeed offers, by £15,000, as the Stamp Duty holiday was about sentiment as much as money and the fundamentals remain strong. “I don’t believe the property market is in a bubble, but it has certainly benefited from Government meddling in the form of the Stamp Duty holiday and mortgage guarantee scheme. We’ve effectively had two years rolled into one due to Government intervention. Looking forward, the fundamentals have not changed, namely money is cheap, it’s still cheaper to own than to rent and there is a profound lack of stock.” Jeremy Leaf, north London estate agent, says the market is calming down slightly, but still “very busy on the ground”. We notice too from connected chains that activity is even stronger in areas outside London where affordability is greater. ’Those who have little chance of making the stamp duty deadline are already considering ways of negotiating their way to completing transactions. We expect activity to settle but not drastically change in the next few months.’ The UK housing boom is running particularly hot in Wales, and parts of the North of England. Halifax’s data shows that Wales has seen the biggest surge in house prices, with the average property costing 11.9% more than a year ago. Two other regions have recorded double-digit growth: the North West (+10.6%) and Yorkshire &amp; Humber (+10.2%), outpacing the average annual rise of 9.5% (the fastest since 2014). For Wales and the North West, these are the biggest percentage gains since April 2005, Halifax says, and for Yorkshire &amp; Humber its the biggest jump since June 2006. But the South of England, particularly London, are lagging. Halifax MD Russell Galley explains: This likely reflects a weakness in city prices given the shift in preference for properties with more space, whilst recent surcharges on stamp duty for non-UK residents and Brexit concerns will also have weighed on the capital’s market. UK house prices have risen to a new peak, as the stamp duty holiday and the stampede for larger houses following the pandemic continues to fuel the market. Halifax reports that the average property now costs £261,743, with annual house price inflation at its strongest level in almost seven years (on its index). According to Halifax, the average price rose by 1.3% in May alone, and was 9.5% higher than a year ago. Several factors seem to be driving prices sharply higher, Halifax says. One is the government’s extended freeze on stamp duty payments, which is reduced from £500,000 at the end of June, and ends three months later. Plus, the savings build up by more prosperous families during lockdown; rising demand for homes better suited to home-working; and a shortage of properties on the market. Russell Galley, managing director of Halifax, explains: “Heading into the traditionally busy summer period, market activity continues to be boosted by the government’s stamp duty holiday, with prospective buyers racing to complete purchases in time to benefit from the maximum tax break ahead of June’s deadline, after which there will be a phased return to full rates. For some homebuyers, lockdown restrictions have also resulted in an unexpected build-up of savings, which can now be deployed to fund bigger deposits for bigger properties, potentially pushing property prices even higher. Galley also predicts that prices could keep rising: Whilst these effects will be temporary, the current strength in house prices also points to a deeper and long-lasting change as buyer preferences shift in anticipation of new, post-pandemic lifestyles – as greater demand for larger properties with more space might warrant an increased willingness to spend a higher proportion of income on housing. These trends, coupled with growing confidence in a more rapid recovery in economic activity if restrictions continue to be eased, are likely to support house prices for some time to come, particularly given the continued shortage of properties for sale.” In London, mining stocks are under pressure following the slowdown in China’s exports. Commodities giant Anglo American (-2%), copper producer Antofagasta (-1.5%) and precious metal producer Fresnillo (-1.4%) are the top fallers. Weaker export growth could indicate less demand for raw materials such as iron ore, copper, coal, nickel and zinc. But the wider FTSE 100 is up 0.2%, or 13 points, at 7082 points. UK focused companies are in the risers, including housebuilders, banks such as Barclays (+1.9%), telecoms operator BT (+1.8%) and Royal Mail (+1.8%). Neil Wilson of Markets.com says investors are waiting for US inflation data later this week, for fresh signals as to when America’s Federal Reserve might slow its stimulus programme. The FTSE 100 is the only early riser as European equity markets opened the week broadly in the red as Chinese trade data maybe just weighed a touch with exports lower than forecast despite imports growing at the fastest clip in 10 years. In London, housebuilders led gains while basic resources stocks fell. Asian shares were mixed, US futures are slightly weaker this morning. It’s a light data docket today – all eyes on the inflation data from the US later in the week alongside the upcoming ECB meeting. Last week’s US Non-Farm Payroll report (showing fewer new jobs than expected) seemed to calm inflation worries, Wilson points out: Friday’s jobs report was something Goldilocks-like: not too cold to douse confidence in the economic recovery in the US, but also not so hot as to make the Fed take its feet off the gas too early.... Inflation remains squarely in focus and the largest potential source of investors angst and market volatility this week. April’s CPI print jumped to 4.2%, the highest since 2008. The month-on-month increase in the core reading of 0.9% was the strongest since 1982. Given this, the monthly core reading will be the main focus as it will offer a guide on just how transitory or otherwise the pop in inflation is likely to be. European stock markets have begun the new week in the red. The pan-European Stoxx 600 has dropped by 0.3%, away from last week’s record high. Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC are both down almost 0.4%. In Frankfurt, chipmaker Infineon Technologies (-1.3%) and chemicals firm Linde (-1.3%) are among the fallers, along with takeaway operator Delivery Hero (-2%) and energy firms RWE (-1.1%) and Siemens Energy (-1.6%). The bad news for manufacturers, and consumers, is that the global shortage of semiconductors won’t end soon. Singapore’s Flex, one of the world’s largest electronics contract manufacturers, has warned that it will take at least a year for supplies to catch up with demand, the Financial Times reports this morning. That would mean more delays and disruption for industries around the world, such as carmakers and technology manufacturers. And it’s likely to result in higher prices, with factories already reporting that input costs are rising extremely rapidly this year. The FT says: A rapid rebound in vehicle sales combined with a lockdown-driven boom in games consoles, laptops and televisions has left the world’s chipmakers overwhelmed by the sharp increase in demand. Singapore-based Flex has more than 100 sites in 30 countries and manufactures devices and electronics for companies including Ford, British household appliances designer Dyson, UK online grocer Ocado and US computer and printer maker HP. Its position in the supply chain makes it a large buyer of chips. Lynn Torrel, Flex’s chief procurement and supply chain officer, said that the manufacturers it relies on for semiconductors have pushed back their forecasts for when the shortage will end. “With such strong demand, the expectation is mid to late-2022 depending on the commodity. Some are expecting [shortages to continue] into 2023,” she said. The German factory orders report also shows that real turnover in manufacturing fell by 2.6% in April, compared with March. That could be another sign that supply shortages are hampering the sector, as Germany tries to return to growth after suffering a 1.8% contraction in the first quarter of 2021. Oliver Rakau of Oxford Economics tweets that bottlenecks appear to be hurting German industry: German factories have reported a drop in orders - another sign that supply shortages are causing ructions. New manufacturing orders at Europe’s largest economy dropped by 0.2% month-on-month - missing forecasts of a 1% gain (according to a Reuters poll). The weakness was driven by a drop in domestic orders, which fell by 4.3%, while overseas orders rose by 2.7% month-on-month, the Economy Ministry reported. Orders for intermediate goods (products designed to be used in a finished item) fell 1.0%, while capital goods inched by by 0.2% and new orders for consumer products rose by 1.4%. Bloomberg says it’s a sign that supply shortages and higher prices are undercutting Germany’s economic recovery, adding: Manufacturing has been a stronghold in Europe’s largest economy over the past months, benefiting from earlier recoveries in places such as China and the U.S. Lately though, businesses have run into unprecedented supply-chain issues amid shortages of parts and raw materials. Reuters also highlights how China’s export growth may have been hit by disruption at some major ports: “Exports surprised a bit on the downside, maybe due to the COVID cases in Guangdong province which slowed down the turnover in Shenzhen and Guangzhou ports,” said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, adding that turnover at ports in Guangdong will likely remain slow in June. Major shipping companies warned clients of worsening congestion at Shenzhen’s Yantian port in Guangdong province after the discovery of several cases among port staff. On the ground in Guangdong, factories have yet to report widespread capacity cuts over the outbreak but admitted efficiency issues as they tried to meet overseas demand. Chen Linsheng, COO at Anlan, a Shenzhen-based manufacturer of skincare and beauty-care devices, told Reuters while there was no impact on production, staff are now subject to a series of COVID tests and not allowed back into the factory without a negative result. “We are not allowed going out (of the city). We need to report in advance and cannot even go to Guangzhou or Foshan on our own,” said Chen, adding that a lot of meetings have moved back online. More here: China’s imports grow at fastest pace in decade as materials prices surge Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The global chip shortage, rising raw material costs and creaking supply chains are all weighing on the global economy as it tries to recover from the shock of the Covid-19 pandemic. And new trade data from China suggests these factors are now biting into growth. China’s exports slowed in May, growing by 27.9% year-on-year, down from 32.3% in April. That’s weaker than economists had expected. It suggests the sharp recovery from the pandemic may be slowing -- due to ongoing Covid-19 disruption, and deepening problems getting hold of semiconductors. Imports surged by 51.1% in May - the fastest jump in a decade. But that growth in import values was fueled by surging commodity prices in the scramble for metals and fuel, which is creating concerns about rising inflation. Iris Pang of ING says China’s car industry was hurt by the shortage of semiconductors: The main reason for the shortfall is that all export items related to semiconductor chips have slowed. Auto processing products and parts, the biggest export item, fell 4%YoY in terms of export value. This is most likely the result of the semiconductor chip shortage. Pang also points out that recent Covid-19 outbreaks are also hitting trade. which could drive up consumer prices in the shops. Since the end of May, there have been around 10 Covid cases daily in Guangdong, where most electronics factories are located. Shipments from the port in Shenzhen that process most of the electronic throughput have been affected by Covid. Port workers now have to have Covid tests and port operations have been disrupted. Some factories in Guangdong were also affected by Covid, mostly caused by workers queuing up for testing. As such we expect June trade and production data will be affected. This could push up prices of electronic goods in general and affect China’s export prices and eventually import prices in the US and Europe. Supply chains in Asia will also likely be disrupted. More here: China: Exports slow but imports jump Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, said while import prices increased at a rapid pace, import volumes probably edged down in May. “Once again, supply constraints are partly to blame – inbound shipments of semiconductors continued to drop back. So too did imports of industrial metals.” Commodity prices have dipped following the data, with traders anticipating that future demand may be slower than expected Also coming up today Experts are digesting the deal on a minimum global corporation tax rate of 15%, agreed by leading finance ministers on Saturday. The G7 also agreed that countries should have the right to tax the largest, most profitable multinationals’ profit in the locations where it is generated, a landmark moment. But Amazon could escape paying this clampdown on the “largest and most profitable multinational enterprises”, due to its low profit margins. Richard Murphy, visiting professor of accounting at the Sheffield University management school, said the 10% profits threshold was “inappropriate” because of different business models for different companies. He added that current approaches to reporting profits in each country were “easily gamed”. “This could turn out to be a false hope unless they get the detail right.” Mortgage lender Halifax’s latest house price index is expected to confirm that prices have surged around 10% in the last year.

But while larger-than-life characters such as Allen Ginsberg, William Burroughs and Neal Cassady wandered in and out of Kerouac’s works under a variety of pseudonyms, one important figure in the writer’s life is conspicuously absent: his daughter, Jan Kerouac, who died 25 years ago this week. Jan was pretty much erased from the Kerouac legend even before she was born. She met her father only twice before he died in 1969, and in the quarter of a century between his death and her own, she had to fight for recognition and monetary support from his estate. But Jan wasn’t only the secret child of a famous author. She was a writer in her own right, with two published novels and a third one almost finished when she died at the age of 44, following years of drinking, drug abuse and kidney failure. Jack had a complicated relationship with women. He was married three times: in 1946 to art student Edie Parker, which lasted less than two years; then in 1950 for eight months to Joan Haverty, Jan’s mother; and in 1966, three years before his death, to Stella Sampas, the sister of a childhood friend from his hometown of Lowell, Massachusetts. But the freewheeling godfather of the Beats, who espoused a dream of mystical hobo liberty, never quite managed to cut the apron strings. It was his mother Gabrielle, says Gerald Nicosia, his biographer and a longtime friend of Jan’s, who fed his lifelong estrangement from his only child. Nicosia first met Jan in 1978 when he was researching his Kerouac biography Memory Babe. She had inherited her father’s wanderlust and was living a life on the road, sofa-surfing around the US. Nicosia tracked her down to Russian Hill in San Francisco, where she was crashing with a friend. From the moment he clapped eyes on her, Nicosia knew she couldn’t be anyone else’s daughter – “that black hair and those blue eyes” – but it wasn’t until Jan was 10, having grown up in poverty, that Kerouac began to pay maintenance cheques of $52 a month, after a blood test confirmed his paternity. Nicosia says Kerouac took so long to recognise Jan because of his mother’s beliefs: “Gabrielle was a very devout Catholic and when Joan got pregnant with Jan, Jack asked her to get an abortion because he wasn’t making any money and didn’t think he could support a kid. His first book, The Town and the City, had sold 400 copies and he couldn’t get anyone to even look at On the Road at that point.” But Joan didn’t want an abortion – they were also illegal when Jan was born, in February 1952 – and Kerouac’s mother had told him that he could never leave a pregnant woman. So he claimed Jan wasn’t his child. “That was his way of placating his mother and being able to leave Joan,” says Nicosia. “The trouble was, he was stuck with that lie for the rest of his life. He could never come back and say, actually, she is my daughter. Jack’s mother outlived him, so he always had to deny it.” Jan met her father for the first time at the paternity test. She would meet with him once more, later in his life, when he lived in Florida, and had one conversation with him on the phone. Nicosia says that privately, Kerouac would talk about Jan to fellow Beat figures such as John Clellon Holmes, and he carried a photograph of her in his wallet, “hidden beneath some other pictures”.

The Australotitan cooperensis, a plant-eating dinosaur of the family known as titanosaurs, likely lived between 92m and 96m years ago, during the Cretaceous period. It was between 25m and 30m long, stood between 5m and 6.5m from the ground to its hip and had a very long neck and tail, making it similar in appearance to well-known dinosaurs such as Brachiosaurus and Apatosaurus. Nicknamed Cooper, the Australian dinosaur was first uncovered near Cooper Creek in the Eromanga Basin in 2007, but has only now been described scientifically by Queensland Museum and Eromanga Natural History Museum paleontologists. They found the dinosaur’s shoulder blades, limb, and pelvic bones, many of them largely intact. The remote location, size and fragility of the dinosaur bones contributed to a delay in officially determining that the remains belonged to a previously unknown species, said Robyn Mackenzie, a field paleontologist. “Such big, fragile bones literally took years to prepare and clean,” she said. Mackenzie co-founded the Eromanga Natural History Museum with her husband, Stuart, after dinosaur bones were first discovered on their family property in 2006. The remains of about 15 dinosaurs have since been found on the property, she said. She said based on the lengths and circumferences of Cooper’s limbs the dinosaur would have weighed about 67 tonnes, although figures can vary widely depending on the method of estimation used. A second Australotitan specimen has also been discovered at Eromanga.

However, George’s bones were more fragmented, making them more difficult to study. The world’s largest known titanosaur is Patagotitan, found in South America. Analysis showed Australotitan was closely related to three other Australian sauropods, a group of dinosaurs that includes the titanosaurs. The three other species were found further north, in Winton. Dr Scott Hocknull, a palaeontologist at the Queensland Museum, said it was possible the four species evolved from each other, and into different habitats. “At the time the dinosaurs were moving around in this Eromanga area, it was the last of the great inland sea,” which had covered parts of Australia for tens of millions of years,” he said. “New land was being developed. The expectation that dinosaurs would fill up this land would also mean that different habitats would evolve.” The palaeontologists noticed crush marks on some of Cooper’s bones, suggesting after its death it had been trampled by other sauropods. “We came across a trample zone, which is basically trampled mud that has solidified and hardened into a rock shelf,” said Hocknull.

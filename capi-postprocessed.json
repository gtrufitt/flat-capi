Both are Italian, and both were three years old when Nadal first won the French Open in 2005.<br><br>There are more slam winners in action today, in the form of Sloane Stephens (who will be on court momentarily) and Sofia Kenin, who plays Greece’s Maria Sakkari. There’s plenty of US interest, even with Serena Williams going home – not least in Coco Gauff, chasing her first slam quarter final place today. Gauff wasn’t born when Serena first won here in 2002.

She labours through her service game, but will at least force Sakkari to serve it out at 6-1, 5-2. Kenin edges to 15-30 but more unforced errors cost her, and Sakkari closes out the hold with a big ace down the middle. Let’s check in with events over on Lenglen, where Sofia Kenin v Maria Sakkari promised to be one of the day’s closest contests. It’s not gone that way at all; Sakkari is 6-1, 4-1 up and serving to move a game away. There’s no on-court interview because Musetti retired from the match. It was a sad ending for the teenager, but he showed everyone what he’s capable of in the first two sets. Djokovic will be glad to have turned things around so fast; his next opponent, Matteo Berrettini, got a walkover into the last eight after Roger Federer pulled out. Musetti can hardly move now, and as Djokovic seals his 13th game in a row, the Italian throws in the towel. What a strange game that was, but the world No 1 has come through it. Fifth set: *Djokovic 6-7, 6-7, 6-1, 6-0, 3-0 Musetti Musetti is also struggling with a groin problem, and getting moved back and forth and side to side is proving too much. It’s another break, and the Italian’s target now is probably just to win another game. Fifth set: Djokovic 6-7, 6-7, 6-1, 6-0, 2-0 Musetti* Credit to Musetti, he’s still out there fighting, trying different things – but with little success, as Djokovic holds to 15. This match reminds me a little of Murray v Nalbandian at Wimbledon back in 2005, when Murray was outstanding in the first two sets but just didn’t have the legs for a five-set match. Fifth set: *Djokovic 6-7, 6-7, 6-1, 6-0, 1-0 Musetti Back comes Lorenzo Musetti. Whatever has gone before, he’s in a one-set shootout now. Djokovic stops for treatment on a finger cut, and winces a little after winning a long rally. Musetti finds a nice cross-court angle but Djokovic is reading everything now. Double break point, and Musetti goes for a winner that’s close – but not close enough. Maria Sakkari wins the first set 6-1! Kenin thought she had a foothold in her first set against Maria Sakkari, getting a break back – but the Greek immediately restores her four-game cushion, breaking Kenin for a third time with a double-handed overhead smash. Sakkari seals a love-hold with a drop shot, and is well on track for her first ever slam quarter-final appearance. Musetti takes a medical timeout, heading off court with the physio. He looked jaded in that fourth set, but getting absolutely rinsed will do that to you. Utterly routine for Djokovic, who has pulled back two sets in around 40 minutes. Each of the first two sets lasted more than an hour. Has Musetti got anything left in the tank? We’ll find out. On Suzanne-Lenglen, Sofia Kenin is in big trouble early on – she’s 4-0 down to Maria Sakkari in the first set. Fourth set: *Djokovic 6-7, 6-7, 6-1, 5-0 Musetti He does get on the board on his first service point – just the 10th point he’s won since claiming the second set. He works his way to 40-15, then Djokovic slaps a backhand return down the line. Deuce, then break point as a drop shot gives Musetti too much to do. He repeats the trick, and it’s five-love Djokovic. Fourth set: Djokovic 6-7, 6-7, 6-1, 4-0 Musetti* It’s another Djokovic hold to love, and Musetti hasn’t won a single point in this set yet. Fourth set: *Djokovic 6-7, 6-7, 6-1, 3-0 Musetti I know Djokovic is the world No 1, and Lorenzo Musetti is in uncharted slam territory – but I can’t recall a match turning around this fast. Musetti is broken to love again, barely able to get a racket on anything and looking completely defeated. Fourth set: Djokovic 6-7, 6-7, 6-1, 2-0 Musetti* Djokovic rattles through a service hold to love; he’s won 24 of the last 27 points. Fourth set: *Djokovic 6-7, 6-7, 6-1, 1-0 Musetti Just as Djokovic has improved, Musetti has lost his way, and he opens the fourth set with an error-strewn service game. Djokovic, giving nothing away cheaply now, powers to a break to love. It’s fair to say the momentum has shifted. In case you missed it earlier, Coco Gauff raced past Ons Jabeur to reach her first slam quarter-final. She will face the Czech, Barbora Krejcikova, who beat Sloane Stephens so comprehensively that she’s already back on court in the mixed doubles. Musetti goes long from a big Djokovic serve, and the Serb has cut the deficit in a 23-minute set. The next few games feel like they will be pivotal. Third set: *Djokovic 6-7, 6-7, 5-1 Musetti Is Musetti starting to think about the next set? Yes, would seem to be the answer, as Djokovic secures the double break. He’ll serve for the third set, which has lasted barely 20 minutes. Over on Suzanne-Lenglen last year’s finalist, Sofia Kenin, is about to get under way against Greece’s Maria Sakkari. A potential final rematch with Iga Swiatek awaits in the next round; the champion plays Marta Kostyuk in the evening game. Third set: Djokovic 6-7, 6-7, 4-1 Musetti* Djokovic has shaken off the weird funk from the first two sets and is now dominating the points. A test of Musetti’s resolve here; can he keep finding ways to trouble the world No 1? Third set: *Djokovic 6-7, 6-7, 3-1 Musetti A welcome hold for Musetti to get on the board in this third set. A word for Britain’s Alfie Hewett, who has seen off Shingo Kunieda 6-3, 6-4 in the men’s wheelchair final to win his second straight French Open, and his fifth singles slam overall. Hewett also won the men’s doubles final on Sunday with partner Gordon Reid. Chapeau, Alfie. Third set: Djokovic 6-7, 6-7, 3-0 Musetti* Djokovic looks a much tougher prospect now, his forehand cleaner and movement sharper. Musetti keeps him guessing with some elegant drop shots, but it’s a comfortable hold. Third set: *Djokovic 6-7, 6-7, 2-0 Musetti This looks more like the Djokovic we know, springing around the court, throwing his hands up theatrically as Musetti finds the baseline, and closing down a drop shot to set up break point. He takes it as Musetti fires an ambitious cross-courter wide! Third set: Djokovic 6-7, 6-7, 1-0 Musetti* (*denotes next server) A welcome, trouble-free hold for Djokovic, who hasn’t found his A-game at all so far. Diego Schwartzman comes through a three-hour slugfest with Jan-Lennard Struff, who missed seven set points in the opener and never really recovered. Next up for Schwartzman: Rafa Nadal or Jannik Sinner in the quarter-finals. Djokovic skews a half-hearted volley wide to present Musetti with five set points. He takes the second one with a serve out wide. Djokovic promptly heads to the dressing room to gather his thoughts. This is really on now! Second-set tiebreak: Djokovic 1-5 Musetti The Italian grabs an early point on the Djokovic serve, then follows it up with some absurd defensive work, and a looping lob that somehow clips the baseline. Djokovic then goes long, and Musetti is 4-0 up! Djokovic pulls one back, and should bury the next point, but he lets Musetti back in and pays the price ... It’s five-one at the change of ends. Second set: Djokovic 6-7, 6-6 Musetti It’s a nerveless love-hold from Djokovic, and we’re heading for another tie-break ... Second set: *Djokovic 6-7, 5-6 Musetti Thanks, Gregg. You would expect Djokovic to turn up the heat here, but it’s still very scrappy from the world No 1 and Musetti holds comfortably, aided by an absolute ripper of a cross-court winner that has Djokovic shaking his head in disbelief. Second set: Djokovic 6-7, 5-5 Musetti* This is a strong hold for Djokovic under intense pressure. He’s still struggling to land his first serve as regularly as he’d like but some good craft in the rallies forces his younger opponent to swipe long. A bad miss at the net by the world No 1 makes it a bit more nervy than he’d like but he holds to 30 with an overhead smash. I’ll hand back to Niall now. Thanks. Second set: *Djokovic 6-7, 4-5 Musetti Excellent again from Musetti. Djokovic pounces on a weak second serve to level the game at 30-30. Musetti responds with a deep forehand that Djokovic handles like it’s a grenade, landing it limply back centre court, where Musetti smashes it into the corner before finding another winner to take the game. Djokovic will have to serve to stay in the second set. Second set: Djokovic 6-7, 4-4 Musetti* Struff is battling to stay in the match against Diego Schwartzman on Suzanne-Lenglen. He trails 4-3 but it’s on serve. Back on Philippe-Chatrier there’s a delightful little rally at the net that Musetti wins to get back into this game at 30-30. Musetti pounces on Djokovic’s second serve to dominate the following rally before hammering an overhand winner into the corner to bring up a break point. He can’t take it though, hitting long when he was in a good position mid-rally. The world No 1 keeps his composure, sending his much younger opponent running for errands to hold. Second set: *Djokovic 6-7, 3-4 Musetti Musetti holds to 30 to get his head in front again in this entertaining second set. He varied his serve well and gave little away for Djokovic to attack. Second set: Djokovic 6-7, 3-3 Musetti* This is so good! Djokovic uses all his experience to give the 19-year-old the runaround with some feather-fingered drop shots to lead 30-0. Musetti responds with some improvisation by dinking a winner back the way it came and then a jabbed backhand past his opponent to level at 30-30. He then clatters a forehand into the corner to bring up another break point. What chutzpah! Djokovic holds his nerve though, landing three first serves to hold and level the set. Second set: *Djokovic 6-7, 2-3 Musetti But Djokovic bounces back! Musetti is wild in this game and the No 1 seed keeps his composure to break him to love. Second set: Djokovic 6-7, 1-3 Musetti* Over on Suzanne-Lenglen, Diego Schwartzman has raced into a 3-0 lead in the third set and looks like he’ll be booking his place in the quarter-finals. Back on Court Philippe-Chatrier, Djokovic has been broken again! Djokovic’s first serve was off and his second serve was a gift for Musetti, who battered it back and took control of the game. Djokovic is in real trouble. Second set: *Djokovic 6-7, 1-2 Musetti What a game that was! After going 0-30 behind, Musetti produces a wonderful drop shot and an incredible half-volley to level up at 30-30. Djokovic’s head droops and Musetti pounds his way to a 2-1 lead in the second set. Second set: Djokovic 6-7, 1-1 Musetti* Thanks Niall. Djokovic is continuing to make hard work of all he does. He hammers a lame backhand into the net to go 15-30 behind but digs deep and rallies to level up the second set by holding to 30. Second set: *Djokovic 6-7, 0-1 Musetti The teenager carries on as before in the second set, gliding in behind a drop shot and flicking it away to seal a comfortable hold. On Suzanne-Lenglen, Diego Schwartzman has taken the second set against Struff, and leads 7-6, 6-4. With that, I’ll hand over to Gregg Bakowski ... “Wow, Musetti is the real deal,” says Luke Forrester. “Still only a teenager but very much Djokovic’s equal in this match so far. Keeping this up for a best-of-five will probably be too much for him at this stage in his career but he’s a real prospect.” He has hit a lot of very stylish winners, but equally impressive has been the points where he has ground something out. He just looks very comfortable out there. Musetti wins the first set 7-6 (9-7)! Good grief. Musetti digs in, keeping himself in the rally, and then unleashes a cross-court winner. He’s taken the first set, and deservedly so. What a performance so far! First-set tiebreak: Djokovic 7-8 Musetti Djokovic saves it by a millimetre, clipping the line with an awkward, rangy forehand. On serve, Djokovic goes for a winner down the line – and misses. Another set point for Musetti, this time on serve – but Djokovic saves with a clinical drop shot. Musetti responds, scrambling through the next rally to earn a third set point ... First-set tiebreak: Djokovic 5-6 Musetti Djokovic leaves a return short and Musetti pummels it away for a winner. Can he get back on serve? He can, winning a strange point amid moon balls and mishits from Djokovic. The No 1 tries a cross-court slice but Musetti reads it, and gets a set point as Djokovic nets! First-set tiebreak: Djokovic 4-2 Musetti The Italian has an 8-0 career record in tie breaks. Can he make it nine? Djokovic edges ahead with a drop shot that spins off at a right angle, then muffs a routine return. He does enough on his next two points, on serve, to open a three-point lead. Musetti responds by ripping a backhand down the line! First set: Djokovic 6-6 Musetti Djokovic can only chuckle to himself as Musetti lands a looping cross-court winner from an impossible angle. A big serve out wide seals a hold to 15, and it’s tie-break time ... First set: Djokovic 6-5 Musetti* (*denotes next server) A lovely angled return puts Musetti 15-30 up, but Djokovic quickly closes the door. Can the Italian force a tie-break? First set: *Djokovic 5-5 Musetti (*denotes next server) At 30-all, Djokovic looks primed to pounce – but a change of pace from Musetti gets the job done. The No 1 seed not firing on all cylinders yet. First set: Djokovic 5-4 Musetti* (*denotes next server) A quickfire hold to love for Djokovic, cranking up the heat on his opponent. Over on Lenglen, Schwartzman and Struff are locked at 2-2 in the second. That one might take a while. First set: *Djokovic 4-4 Musetti (*denotes next server) Musetti races to 40-0, going for his shots and making them, but then tries to be a little too ambitious, a series of narrow misses allowing Djokovic back in. At deuce, Djokovic thinks he has this figured out – but Musetti surprises him again, grinding out two long rallies to hold. First set: Djokovic 4-3 Musetti* (*denotes next server) Musetti holds serve, playing with a flair and freedom that has Djokovic a little rattled. In the next game, a peach of a backhand volley has Djokovic applauding, but he’s less charitable on the other points, holding to 15. Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and Elena Rybakina face each other in the singles quarter-finals on Tuesday. This afternoon, they’re teaming up in the women’s doubles. It’s unusual preparation, that’s for sure. Switching focus back to Chatrier, where Djokovic is being made to work hard by Musetti. The Italian is covering a lot of ground – even stumbling over an advertising board at one point – and takes Djokovic to deuce. His variety of shots is causing problems – and he gets the break back as Djokovic sends a backhand into the net! Back on serve, Djokovic 3-2 up. Out on court 12, Alfie Hewett has taken the first set against Shingo Kunieda in the men’s wheelchair final. Hewett won the men’s doubles with Gordon Reid on Sunday, and is a set away from a double slam triumph. Schwartzman wins the first set 7-6 (11-9)! It’s just not meant to be for Struff, who had his first set points some 40 minutes ago. First, his return clips the net cord and drops the wrong side - then Schwartzman’s backhand does the same, and loops over the net. He’s won the set from 5-1 down, saving (I think) seven set points on the way. Back on Chatrier, Djokovic has taken charge of the first set, breaking Musetti to lead 3-1. Schwartzman and Struff are locked in a tie-break that either player will be sorely disappointed to lose. Both players miss set points and stay locked together at 9-9 ... Musetti holds his first service game, closing out with a hefty ace straight down the middle. Into a tie-break on Lenglen, and Schwartzman races into a 3-0 lead – then has a wobble of his own as unforced errors allow Struff back to 3-3 ... Musetti has beaten David Goffin and Marco Cecchinato, conqueror of Djokovic in 2018, on his way to the last 16. He makes quite the start here, pounding a winner down the line on Djokovic’s first service point. He takes the world No 1 to deuce but Djokovic scraps his way through, finding the power to keep Musetti on the back foot. While Djokovic and Musetti knock up on Chatrier, Schwartzman has Struff on the rack at 5-5 but the German finds an ace to hold. We could be heading for a tie-break ... Schwartzman is still scrapping away in the first set, and now has a break point at 5-3 down. Struff double-faults, the nerves a-jangling, and we’re back on serve! Next up on Philippe-Chatrier, it’s world No 1 Novak Djokovic against rising star Lorenzo Musetti. Naturally, Djokovic is the hot favourite – but his Italian opponent has beaten some big names already in his 18 months on the tour. Struff serving for the set on Suzanne-Lenglen at 5-1 up. Schwartzman saves four set points, and gets a break back with some vicious groundstrokes. Still a long way to go to rescue this first set, though ... “I’m super happy, I played really well today,” says Gauff. Asked how her family help her with life in the bubble, she says: “it’s important to have fun. We play Uno every night, and I win all the time.” Coco Gauff wants to get the job done quickly, and after holding to 30 she quickly picks up two match points against an increasingly error-prone opponent. Jabeur saves them both, and a third when Gauff sends a forehand long. A slow-motion Jabeur second serve is dispatched and Gauff digs in on the next rally to seal victory! Schwartzman under a little pressure early on, taken to a third deuce by Struff. The No 10 seed nets a scratchy slice from the back of the court, then double faults. Struff leads 3-1 in the first set. At 30-15 on her own serve, Jabeur sees the match swept away from her in three straight points. First, a poor cross-court lob drops wide; then Gauff sets up break point with a pinpoint backhand return down the line. At the net, Gauff shows great hands to clip a volley onto the line. She has a double break, and leads 6-3, 4-1. Gauff motors to 40-0 then has her first slight wobble on serve as Jabeur rallies to 40-30. Gauff gets the job done as Jabeur nets, another costly unforced error. Jabeur gets on the board with a service hold, not that Gauff will be too concerned; she has looked rock-solid on her own serve so far. On Lenglen, Jan-Lennard Struff opens with a love hold against Diego Schwartzman. The German beat Andrey Rublev on his way here, and is a dangerous opponent. Jabeur starts the second set with a double double-fault, and Gauff claims the break with a ferocious finishing volley. It gets no better for Jabeur on the Gauff serve, her drop shots chased down and her attempted passes cut out clinically. Gauff leads 6-3, 2-0 ... Out on court 12, Dylan Alcott has won the quad wheelchair men’s singles title, beating Dutchman Sam Schroder 6-4, 6-2. It’s the Australian’s third straight French Open win, and his 14th grand slam title. Next up: Britain’s Alfie Hewett takes on Japan’s Shingo Kunieda in the men’s wheelchair final. Kunieda has won this tournament seven times before, so Hewett has his work cut out. Gauff closes out the first set in style, taking it 6-3. She lost just two points on her first serve, and three on her second, in that set. Jabeur does get a drop-shot right, a lovely effort from the back of the court. It’s a rare moment of resistance in another dominant Gauff service game; the American leads 5-2 in the first set. Up next on Lenglen it’s Diego Schwarzman, who faces Germany’s Jan-Lennard Struff. The Argentinian got to the semi-finals last year before running into Rafa Nadal, who may well be waiting in the quarter-finals this time. Time to head over to Chatrier, where Coco Gauff has made a lightning start. Having broken Jabeur in the second game, she leads 4-1 and looks dominant on serve. Jabeur is relying on drop shots to turn points in her favour; it’s not working so far. Krejcikova is having quite the fortnight in Paris; she’s into the quarter-finals in the singles and doubles. “I hope you’ve been entertained,” she tells an appreciative crowd. She insists it was a close game despite the scoreline. “It’s always fun to play here ... I’m looking forward to playing another one.” Krejcikova finds her first ace, then scraps her way to match point. Stephens saves the first, but the Czech takes her next opportunity with another dominant rally. Gauff opens with a comfortable service hold on Chatrier, while Stephens takes the first two points as Krejcikova looks to serve out the match ... It looks as though Krejcikova will be waiting in the quarters for either Gauff or Jabeur; the Czech is cruising to victory over Sloane Stephens, whose unforced error count has crept over 20. Stephens tries to mix it up with a couple of nice drop shots, but as soon as she’s drawn into a rally there looks only one winner. Krejcikova breaks again, and will serve for the match. Coco Gauff walks out onto Chatrier, where she will take on Tunisia’s Ons Jabeur. Gauff won the 2018 juniors’ title here, and is targeting a first grand slam quarter-final place as a professional. Stephens’ serve is unravelling under the pressure, and Krejcikova breaks again with a punchy winner into the corner. She leads 6-2, 3-0 and this one looks over after less than an hour on court. There’s no early second-set dip from Krejcikova, who immediately breaks Stephens, then backs it up with a hold. She’s been very consistent in the longer rallies, forcing Stephens to take on risky shots that she’s not making. Krejcikova wins the first set, 6-2! Stephens holds serve comfortably but can’t make inroads as Krejcikova serves for the net. She tries a little too hard, sending two ambitious efforts into the tramlines, and Krejcikova wraps up the first set with a fine, angled volley. Stephens gets a break point but unforced errors keep costing her, as she nets twice in a row. Krejcikova dominates the next rally, and it’s 5-1. Krejcikova is an accomplished doubles player, winning multiple slams in the women’s and mixed events. She’s now making strides on the singles tour, reaching the final in Dubai, winning in Strasbourg and eliminating Elina Svitolina in the last round here. Krejcikova makes it a double break, holding steady and waiting for the erratic Stephens to blink. She sends a forehand long, and it’s 4-1 to her opponent in the first set. A very solid start from Krejcikova, who has found her rhythm quickly. She breaks after a marathon opening game, then follows up with a hold to love. Sunday saw Serena Williams and Roger Federer bow out, with Federer withdrawing before his fourth-round match against Matteo Berrettini. Ons Jabeur and Coco Gauff will begin at 11am (BST), but over on Suzanne-Lenglen, play has already started. Sloane Stephens, a former finalist here who has slipped down the rankings, is taking on world No 33 Barbora Krejcikova in a battle between two unseeded players. Court Philippe-Chatrier [25] Ons Jabeur v Coco Gauff [24] [1] Novak Djokovic v Lorenzo Musetti [3] Rafael Nadal v Jannik Sinner [18] Evening: Marta Kostyuk v Iga Swiatek [8] Court Suzanne-Lenglen Sloane Stephens v Barbora Krejcikova [10] Diego Schwartzman v Jan-Lennard Struff [4] Sofia Kenin v Maria Sakkari [17] Bonjour, tout le monde. Novak Djokovic and Rafa Nadal have successfully held off the Next Gen – but what about the Next Next Gen? Both players face teenagers today, with Djokovic up against Lorenzo Musetti before Nadal plays Jannik Sinner. Both are Italian, and both were three years old when Nadal first won the French Open in 2005. There are more slam winners in action today, in the form of Sloane Stephens (who will be on court momentarily) and Sofia Kenin, who plays Greece’s Maria Sakkari. There’s plenty of US interest, even with Serena Williams going home – not least in Coco Gauff, chasing her first slam quarter final place today. Gauff wasn’t born when Serena first won here in 2002. Life, it comes at you fast.","charCount":"23818","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/niall-mcveigh\">Niall McVeigh</a> (now) and <a href=\"profile/gregg-bakowski\">Gregg Bakowski</a> (briefly)"},{"headline":"Thailand starts Covid vaccine drive using jabs made by king’s firm","standfirst":"<p>Country aims to vaccinate 70% of people this year but experts express doubts amid supply concerns </p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus – latest updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul>","trailText":"Country aims to vaccinate 70% of people this year but experts express doubts amid supply concerns<br>","byline":"Rebecca Ratcliffe in Bangkok","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1466716e785a9a62ddb8a3a9949a3788c4749b13\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1466716e785a9a62ddb8a3a9949a3788c4749b13/0_122_3648_2189/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Health workers prepare to administer Covid jabs at a vaccination site in the Siam Paragon shopping mall in Bangkok\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Health workers prepare to administer Covid jabs at a vaccination site in the Siam Paragon shopping mall in Bangkok on Monday.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vachira Vachira/NurPhoto/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure>","body":"<p>Thailand has started its Covid vaccination campaign amid concerns over the supply of doses, which are mainly being produced locally by a royal-owned company that has no prior experience of making vaccines.</p> \n<p>Thailand aims to vaccinate 70% of the population before the end of the year, and is relying primarily on AstraZeneca doses produced by Siam Bioscience, a company owned by King Maha Vajiralongkorn.

That suggests the advice from Hoyle’s officials is not absolute, and that it might be arguable that the amendment should be allowed.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Mitchell said Hoyle should

The decision is related to the Commons concept of the “scope” of a bill.</p> \n  <p>This is <a href=\"https://erskinemay.parliament.uk/section/5313/the%20scope%20of%20a%20bill/\">what Erskine May, the Commons procedural rule book, says about scope.</a></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The scope of a bill represents the reasonable limits of its collective purposes, as defined by its existing clauses and schedules. In particular cases, difficult questions of judgment may arise. The scope of a bill, particularly of a bill with several purposes, may be wider than its long title, although the long title may help to determine the scope. Conversely, a bill with a single purpose may have a narrow scope even though the long title is apparently wide (for example, ‘a Bill to amend a certain Act’).</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Amendments are not allowed if they are out of scope.</p> \n  <p>But deciding whether or not an amendment is within scope is not straightforward. An amendment to a clause may be inadmissible because it is not relevant to that clause, but it might be acceptable if tabled in a different form (as a new clause) because it is within the scope of the bill as a whole. And, as a bill goes through parliament, its scope can widen; one amendment may push the door open for others.</p> \n  <p>And at least two stages are involved in deciding if an amendment is in scope. If it clearly isn’t, the clerks will not allow it to be tabled (printed<a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-02/0001/amend/ARIA_day_rep_0607.pdf\"> on the order paper)</a>. But getting an amendment onto the order paper does not mean it will be put to the vote because the Speaker takes the final decision ahead of the debate, on the advice of clerks. This morning they have reportedly told him the aid amendment is inadmissible. Their advice, like government legal advice, is strictly private, but one test is whether passing an amendment would change the nature of the whole bill. Passing this amendment would effectively turn the advanced research and innovation agency bill into the aid spending bill, and so getting it accepted was probably always a long shot (although the MPs behind it had no incentive to admit it).</p> \n  <p>The Speaker can decide to over-rule the advice he gets. John Bercow did this during the Brexit process, generating huge controversy. But when Sir Lindsay Hoyle was elected to replace him, he promised to show more respect for existing convention, and said that if he ever did divert from current procedure (as Bercow did), <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/article/lindsay-hoyle-pledges-greater-transparency-in-veiled-attack-on-john-bercow\">he would publish a statement explaining why. </a>It is not something he has ever had to do.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"adcb6f1299a2eebd9d46343c181992400319d64b\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/adcb6f1299a2eebd9d46343c181992400319d64b/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sir Lindsay Hoyle.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sir Lindsay Hoyle.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UK Parliament/Jessica Taylor/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-06-07T10:34:02.540Z\">at 11.34am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-60bdeb228f08b9889b36b665\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-07T09:49:53.731Z\">10.49am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here is my colleague <strong>Jessica Elgot</strong>’s story about the advice that the rebel amendment on aid spending should not be put to a vote.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/jun/07/tory-rebels-thwarted-in-bid-to-force-vote-on-uk-foreign-aid-cut\">Tory rebels face setback in bid to force vote on UK foreign aid cut</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-60bde99d8f082e80569f8b61\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-07T09:42:09.334Z\">10.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here is more on the decision from the Speaker.</p> \n  <p>This is from the Times’ <strong>Steven Swinford.</strong></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Steven_Swinford/status/1401830960803598337\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">A bid by more than 30 Tory MPs to reverse foreign aid cuts is highly unlikely to go to a vote<br><br>Clerks have advised amendment is 'completely out of scope' and would set a dangerous precedent for all future spending<br><br>There is also 'strong legal advice against it</p>— Steven Swinford (@Steven_Swinford) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Steven_Swinford/status/1401830960803598337?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 7, 2021</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>And this is from the Telegraph’s <strong>Lucy Fisher.</strong></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/LOS_Fisher/status/1401832657835724800\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">BREAKING: Planned Tory rebellion in Commons today aimed at reversing foreign aid cuts has been thwarted.<br><br>Clerks have determined the rebels' amendment is \"completely out of scope\" of ARIA Bill &amp; their unequivocal advice is that it should not be called.</p>— Lucy Fisher (@LOS_Fisher) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LOS_Fisher/status/1401832657835724800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 7, 2021</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-60bde7e88f082e80569f8b46\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-07T09:38:00.516Z\">10.38am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Tory rebellion over aid spending set to be averted as amendment ruled not in scope</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Boris Johnson no longer faces a Commons revolt tonight because the Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, has decided not to call the amendment on the grounds that it is outside the scope of the bill’s purpose, my colleague<strong> Jessica Elgot</strong> reports.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jessicaelgot/status/1401833901111320579\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Parliamentary procedure saves Boris Johnson - the aid rebellion will not happen today - the amendment is not in scope.

In fact there are three outcomes that are all quite possible. They are:</p> \n  <p>1) Ministers could “buy off” the rebels by promising to reverse the aid cut next year. They have already said that the cut (from 0.7% of national income to 0.5%) is only temporary, but there are suspicions that by this Boris Johnson means temporary in the sense that income tax was temporary when William Pitt introduced it to fund the Napoleonic War.</p> \n  <p>2) The Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, may decide not to put the amendment to a vote. Commons officials have allowed the amendment to be tabled, which suggests that it is within the “scope” of the bill (ie, not irrelevant to the topic it covers). But that does not automatically mean it will be selected, even though a large number of MPs want it put to the vote. The Speaker also has to make a judgment about whether it is relevant to the purpose of the bill, and if he concludes that it isn’t - because it would effectively turn a science research bill into an aid spending bill - he can reject it.</p> \n  <p>3) The government could push the amendment to the vote, and lose. Although this would be embarrassing for Johnson, there would be two consolatory bonuses: it would stop this issue overshadowing the G7 summit later this week, and it would reinforce Johnson’s claim to be a leader championing the wishes of the public <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2020/11/25/two-thirds-britons-support-cutting-foreign-aid-bud\">(voters overwhelmingly support the aid spending cut)</a> in the face of obstruction from a supposedly out-of-touch parliament.</p> \n  <p>There are two other outcomes that are less probable.</p> \n  <p>4) The government could push the amendment to a vote without offering any compromise - and squeak a narrow win.</p> \n  <p>5) Ministers could abandon the bill altogether.</p> \n  <p>The final option is highly unlikely although, given that the only person in government who was truly committed to setting up the advanced research and innovation agency was Dominic Cummings, Johnson must find the idea tempting. (One reason why he was willing to cut aid spending in the first place, despite the Tory manifesto saying it should stay at 0.7%, was because higher aid spending was a policy associated with David Cameron, another of his arch rivals.)</p> \n  <p>Here is the agenda for the day.<br></p> \n  <p><em>9.30am:</em> The ONS publishes figures on vaccination rates amongst the over-70s by class.</p> \n  <p><em>10.30am:</em> Dr Bola Owolabi, director of health inequalities for NHS England, speaks at a seminar on about vaccine confidence amongst people from African, Bangladeshi, Caribbean and Pakistani backgrounds.</p> \n  <p><em>12pm:</em> Downing Street is expected to hold its daily lobby briefing.</p> \n  <p><em>2.30pm: </em>Matthew Rycroft, permanent secretary at the Home Office, gives evidence to the public accounts committee about the Windrush compensation scheme.</p> \n  <p><em>2.30pm:</em> Priti Patel, the home secretary, takes questions in the Commons.</p> \n  <p><em>2.30pm:</em> Sir Keir Starmer gives a speech to the GMB conference.</p> \n  <p><em>After 3.30pm:</em> MPs begin debating the remaining stages of the advanced research and invention agency bill.

He said the advice would be available “in a matter of weeks”. Here is the statement from the Speaker, explaining why he was not allowing a vote on the aid spending announcement today and how he was encouraging MPs to apply for an emergency debate on this tomorrow. Sir Lindsay Hoyle said: Amendments and new clauses which are not within the scope of the bill are out of order. Erskine May states: “The scope of a bill represents the reasonable limits of its collective purposes, as defined by its existing clauses and schedules.” In this instance, having taken advice from the house’s senior clerks and the office of Speaker’s counsel, I have deemed new clause 4 to be outside the scope of the bill. New clause 4 is therefore not selected and may not be debated today. I do wish to make a further point. As we all know, the government has, through our standing orders, significant control over the business the house considers on any given day, and its control is particularly strong when it comes to the initiation of public expenditure. Under the International Development (Official Development Assistance Target) Act 2015, it is the duty of the secretary of state to ensure that the target for official development assistance to amount to 0.7% of gross national income is met by the United Kingdom each year. Up ‘til now, however, the house has not had an opportunity for a decisive vote on maintaining the UK’s commitment to the statutory target of 0.7%. I expect that the government should find a way to have this important matter debated and to allow the house formally to take an effective decision. I should say that on an exceptional basis I will consider whether to hear any standing order number 24 applications by 5.30pm today, and the debate to be held tomorrow. Applications should reach my office by no later than 5 o’clock this afternoon. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, is making his Commons statement now. He said from tomorrow people aged between 25 and 29 in England will be able to book a vaccine. Andrew Mitchell, the Conservative former international development secretary who tabled the amendment, told the Commons after the Speaker’s statement that he expected his amendment to be passed by between nine votes and 20. If there is a debate tomorrow, the government will again face defeat. It would not be a vote on legislation, and so technically it would not be binding on the government, but it would be hard for a government to ignore it – particularly one committed to letting parliament “take back control”. Hoyle says the amendment is outside the scope of the bill. But he says he thinks the government should allow MPs to have a vote separately on its decision to cut aid spending. He suggests this could happen tomorrow – because he invites MPs to propose an emergency debate under standing order 24. An application can be made by 5.30pm today, he says. If granted (and he has implied it will be granted), it would take place tomorrow. Hoyle says he wants to make a statement about the amendment. He said when he became Speaker he said he was committed to transparency, and that he would respect the advice he got from clerks. The aid spending amendment (new clause 4) has not been selected, he says. Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Commons Speaker, is about to make his announcement about the aid spending amendment. Tom McTague’s profile of Boris Johnson in The Atlantic is definitely worth reading in full, but for those of you who have not had time to get through all 7,000 words, here are some of the best snippets. Boris Johnson believes “people live by narrative”. He tells McTague: People live by narrative. Human beings are creatures of the imagination. Johnson has been influenced by his grandmother’s advice that what you do is more important than how you do it, McTague writes. He says: At Downing Street, I heard Johnson repeat a saying his maternal grandmother was fond of quoting. “Darling,” he said, mimicking her, “remember, it’s not how you’re doing; it’s what you’re doing.” Johnson said this was “the key advice.” I asked Johnson’s sister, Rachel, about it. She told me their mother was also fond of the saying. “It’s about being in the moment,” she said, rather than worrying about how things will turn out. One suspects this explains a lot ... Johnson has described himself as a “very, very bad Christian”. McTague says: A friend of his once told me he suspected that Johnson subscribed to a pre-Christian morality system, with a multitude of gods and no clear set of rules. I put this to the prime minister, but he dismissed the notion. “Christianity is a superb ethical system and I would count myself as a kind of very, very bad Christian,” he told me. “No disrespect to any other religions, but Christianity makes a lot of sense to me.” Johnson does not see himself as a nationalist, McTague says. He writes: [Johnson] told me that he doesn’t think of himself as a nationalist, but he argued that individuals need to feel that they belong, and they shouldn’t be patronised for worrying that their traditions and connections are being eroded. More than half of voters want the public inquiry into the Covid pandemic to start either this summer (39%) or this autumn (17%), new polling from Ipsos MORI suggests. Only 17% back spring 2022, the start date proposed by Boris Johnson, according to the survey. But this does not seem to affect the voters’ overall perception of the government. On headline voting intention, the Conservatives (44%) have a nine-point lead over Labour (35%) – up from a three-point lead last month. And the proportion of people saying the government has handled the crisis badly is now at its lowest level since last spring. Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, will announce at 3.30pm, in the Commons chamber, whether or not the aid spending amendment will be accepted. This is from the Independent’s Ashley Cowburn reports. And these are from my colleague Jessica Elgot. On the BBC’s World at One Andrew Mitchell, the Conservative former international development secretary who tabled the amendment to restore the 0.7% aid spending target next year, said that reports this morning that his amendment would definitely not be allowed (see 10.38am) were premature. Mitchell said that he met Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Commons Speaker, this morning to argue why it should be allowed and that Hoyle would not be making his decision until a meeting starting at 1.30pm. Here are some of the other points he made. Mitchell claimed that the pro-government briefing about his amendment being disallowed was premature, and could be counter-productive. He told the programme: Certainly, some of the briefing that he’s already made up his mind seeks to trespass on Mr Speaker’s authority. He won’t have liked that very much. He said that his amendment was “clearly in order”, because it was allowed on the order paper, and that whether or not it was in scope (see 11.33am) was only one factor to be taken into account. He said other issues could include “parliament’s relationship with the executive” - a reference to the fact ministers proposed cutting aid spending without giving MPs a vote on the issue. He said that, if Hoyle did allow the amendment to be put to a vote, he would not have to publish a statement explaining why he was ignoring existing parliamentary conventions. When Hoyle became Speaker, he promised to do this if he took a decision overturning standing orders or breaking “long-established” conventions. Mitchell said that he had been told this decision would not cross that threshold. That suggests the advice from Hoyle’s officials is not absolute, and that it might be arguable that the amendment should be allowed. Mitchell said Hoyle should take into account that at the 2019 election government and opposition MPs were all elected promising to keep aid spending at 0.7% of national income. The Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, has said that a third Covid wave is expected “later in the summer and into the autumn”, adding: “The more people mix and meet, the more people will fall ill.” But he said the peak would be “much flatter”. There are 97 cases of the Delta variant in Wales, with a worrying cluster in Conwy in the north. Drakeford said the government was confident the vaccination programme was breaking the link between Covid and the Alpha variant, first discovered in Kent, but he said it was less clear if the programme suppressed the Delta variant as effectively. Here is a summary of the key points from the Downing Street lobby briefing. Boris Johnson wants to stop using the term “special relationship” to discuss the alliance with the US, No 10 confirmed. (See 1.03pm.) No 10 hinted that aid spending could exceed the downgraded target of 0.5% of gross national income when the donation of coronavirus vaccines is taken into account. As PA Media reports, the PM’s spokesman said: “You can expect the PM to set out more details at the G7 this week on the UK’s plans to share surplus doses with developing countries.” Asked if it would be on top of the existing aid budget, the spokesman said: “The £10bn has been largely allocated in the spending plans already set out with regards to ODA funding, but I’m not going to jump ahead of what the PM might say later this week with regards to the commitment.” The spokesman refused to condemn football supporters who booed England players taking the knee. He said that the PM was urging people to “get behind” the England team, but that he also respected the right of people to protest peacefully. Asked whether Johnson believed that taking a knee showed support for the political aims of the Black Lives Matter movement, the spokesman said: The prime minister’s spoken on the record on this issue before. On taking the knee, specifically, the prime minister is more focused on action rather than gestures. We have taken action with things like the Commission on Racial and Ethnic Disparities and that’s what he’s focused on delivering. The spokesman said Johnson was “supportive” of Oliver Dowden’s comment this morning accusing the ECB of going “over the top” by suspending the bowler Ollie Robinson from international cricket over racist and sexist tweets posted in 2012 and 2013. Here is Dowden’s own tweet on the matter. The spokesman said data emerging this week would be crucial in deciding whether all Covid restrictions in England can be lifted on 21 June as planned. He said: There still remains that there is nothing in the data currently to suggest step 4 can’t go ahead at the earliest date. But we do need to look very closely at the data over this coming week, which will be crucial to decide and really to get a sense of the data, particularly on hospitalisations and whether or not the excellent vaccine rollout programme has sufficiently severed that link between the increase in cases, which we always expected to happen, particularly after step 3, and that subsequently leading to hospitalisations and deaths. At the briefing the spokesman seemed to place particular emphasis on the word “currently”. The spokesman said there were no plans to reduce the time between first vaccines and second vaccines for the under-50s. The spokesman did not deny reports that ministers over-ruled a recommendation from the Joint Biosecurity Centre last week for Malta to be added to the green list for travel. Boris Johnson does not like the term “special relationship” to describe the UK’s alliance with the US, Downing Street has confirmed. At the No 10 lobby briefing the PM’s spokesperson confirmed this was Johnson’s view, and did not deny that Johnson viewed the phrase as “needy” and “weak”. The claim was first made in the Atlantic profile of Johnson by Tom McTague published today. (See 12.14pm.) McTague wrote: In an early phone call with Joe Biden, an aide told me, Johnson said he disliked the phrase special relationship after the president used it. To Johnson it seemed needy and weak. Asked if this was true, the spokesperson claimed that this was a view Johnson has expressed before. He said: The prime minister is on the record previously saying he prefers not to use the phrase but that in no way detracts from the importance with which we regard our relationship with the US, our closest ally. The spokesperson did not deny that Johnson had described the phrase, which has been used by leaders from Winston Churchill onwards, as needy and weak. Asked about this, the spokesperson just repeated that Johnson preferred not to use the phrase. Asked if Johnson wanted the media to stop using the phrase, the spokesperson replied: I don’t think the prime minister would entertainment the prospect of trying to tell the media what to say. Although Johnson may have expressed reservations about the phrase before, these have never been well-publicised and it did not stop the White House using the phrase when it briefed on Joe Biden’s first conversation with Johnson after be became president. The two men will meet for the first time this week, as Johnson hosts the G7 in Cornwall, and it will be interesting to see if they can get through it without deploying the phrase again. I will post more from the lobby briefing soon. All over-18s will be offered a Covid vaccine by the start of next week, the Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, has said. Figures published today show 2.18 million people, or 86% of the adult population in Wales, have had a first dose and almost 1.25 million people have had a second dose. Take-up is higher than 90% for first doses in all people over 60; in healthcare workers; care home residents and staff and all those who are extremely clinically vulnerable. Drakeford said: I am very proud to say that Wales has one of the best Covid vaccination programmes in the world. We will make the offer of vaccination to all eligible adults six weeks ahead of schedule and we expect to reach 75% take-up across all priority groups and age groups a month ahead of target. This is a remarkable achievement and a tribute to the hard work of all those involved in the programme – to all those doing the complex work of planning behind the scenes and to the thousands of people vaccinating and helping to run the clinics across the country. We’ll hear about the fate of the Tory rebel amendment on aid spending at 1.30pm, the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg reports. There will be two statements in the Commons this afternoon before the debate on the the advanced research and innovation agency bill starts. The Atlantic’s Tom McTague has published a 7,000-word profile of Boris Johnson, partly based on multiple interviews with him. McTague has summarised some of his key findings in a Twitter thread starting here. People from Pakistani and Bangladeshi backgrounds have the lowest rates of receiving a second dose of Covid-19 vaccine among all ethnic minority groups in England, PA Media reports. PA says: Among people aged 70 and over, 82.4% of people from a Pakistani background with a first dose of vaccine were likely to have received a second dose by 9 May, along with 82.7% of those from a Bangladeshi background. The equivalent rate for people identifying as white British is 96.3%. The figures, from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), also suggest 84.0% of people identifying as black African who had received a first dose of vaccine went on to receive a second dose, along with 87.0% of those identifying as black Caribbean. These are from the BBC’s Iain Watson with the latest he’s learned on the fate of the Tory rebel amendment on aid spending. Covid-19 case rates are rising in more local areas of the UK than at any point since early January, with numbers increasing in almost all parts of north-west England, London and Scotland, PA Media reports. PA says: The figures come as health secretary Matt Hancock indicated ministers at Westminster were open to delaying the easing of restrictions in England scheduled for June 21, while the Scottish government has paused a relaxing of rules in parts of central Scotland. The rise in rates has yet to be mirrored by a steady increase in Covid-19 hospital cases, however, with the latest data showing patient numbers have climbed slightly to levels last seen at the end of May. Nearly three-quarters of local areas of the UK (283 out of 380) recorded a week-on-week rise in Covid-19 case rates for the seven days to 2 June. This is the highest proportion since 6 January. In just under half of these places (134), the rise was small enough to be in single figures. But a growing number of areas are recording sharp jumps in rates, some of them large enough to push them above the symbolic level of 100 cases per 100,000 people When using a seven-day average to flatten out fluctuations in the data, 256 of 380 local areas in the UK are currently recording a rise in rates - the highest number since 10 January. And this is from one of Hannah White’s colleague at the Institute for Government thinktank, Alice Lilly. These are from Hannah White, the parliament specialist at the Institute for Government thinktank and a former Commons clerk. Boris Johnson was calling some of the Tory MPs planning to rebel on the aid spending amendment asking them to back the government, the Evening Standard’s Joe Murphy reports. Andrew Mitchell, the Conservative former international development secretary who tabled the rebel amendment on aid, told Sky News that he had been told by the Speaker that no decision has yet been taken about whether it will be allowed. But Tory sources are briefing that Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, is being strongly advised that the amendment should be rejected. We have not had official confirmation yet that the rebel Tory aid amendment will not be allowed, but this is what is being briefed by reliable sources this morning. The decision is related to the Commons concept of the “scope” of a bill. This is what Erskine May, the Commons procedural rule book, says about scope. The scope of a bill represents the reasonable limits of its collective purposes, as defined by its existing clauses and schedules. In particular cases, difficult questions of judgment may arise. The scope of a bill, particularly of a bill with several purposes, may be wider than its long title, although the long title may help to determine the scope. Conversely, a bill with a single purpose may have a narrow scope even though the long title is apparently wide (for example, ‘a Bill to amend a certain Act’). Amendments are not allowed if they are out of scope. But deciding whether or not an amendment is within scope is not straightforward. An amendment to a clause may be inadmissible because it is not relevant to that clause, but it might be acceptable if tabled in a different form (as a new clause) because it is within the scope of the bill as a whole. And, as a bill goes through parliament, its scope can widen; one amendment may push the door open for others. And at least two stages are involved in deciding if an amendment is in scope. If it clearly isn’t, the clerks will not allow it to be tabled (printed on the order paper). But getting an amendment onto the order paper does not mean it will be put to the vote because the Speaker takes the final decision ahead of the debate, on the advice of clerks. This morning they have reportedly told him the aid amendment is inadmissible. Their advice, like government legal advice, is strictly private, but one test is whether passing an amendment would change the nature of the whole bill. Passing this amendment would effectively turn the advanced research and innovation agency bill into the aid spending bill, and so getting it accepted was probably always a long shot (although the MPs behind it had no incentive to admit it). The Speaker can decide to over-rule the advice he gets. John Bercow did this during the Brexit process, generating huge controversy. But when Sir Lindsay Hoyle was elected to replace him, he promised to show more respect for existing convention, and said that if he ever did divert from current procedure (as Bercow did), he would publish a statement explaining why. It is not something he has ever had to do. Here is my colleague Jessica Elgot’s story about the advice that the rebel amendment on aid spending should not be put to a vote. Here is more on the decision from the Speaker. This is from the Times’ Steven Swinford. And this is from the Telegraph’s Lucy Fisher. Boris Johnson no longer faces a Commons revolt tonight because the Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, has decided not to call the amendment on the grounds that it is outside the scope of the bill’s purpose, my colleague Jessica Elgot reports. Lisa Nandy, the shadow foreign secretary, told Sky News this morning that cutting the aid budget was not in the UK’s interests. She said: The government is making a real mistake, they’re about to go into the most important week in many, many months, the G7, with a major plank of global Britain in tatters. [Boris Johnson] could change his mind, he could reverse this, he could just admit that cutting global aid in the middle of a pandemic is the wrong thing to do. It’s short-sighted, it’s not in Britain’s interest and he could solve this very quickly. Gordon Brown, the former Labour prime minister, restated his opposition to the government’s cut in aid spending in an interview this morning. He told BBC Breakfast: It’s a life-and-death issue, we’re actually deciding who lives and who dies, particularly at this point where if we withdraw the money for vaccination it’s the equivalent of pulling away the needle from a kid or from an adult who is sick who needs the vaccination, a 90% cut, for example, in support for polio vaccination. There has been an all-party consensus, all parties, for 25 years that we need 0.7%, we need to play our role in the world by being one of the leaders in aid and, really, this is not the right time to pull things away because basically this is when the poorest countries need help most. Lucy Frazer, the solicitor general, was on the morning interview round on behalf of No 10 and, when asked about the prospect of ministers trying to “buy off” tonight’s planned rebellion by promising to restore the aid cuts next year (see 9.21am), she played down the prospect. When this proposal was put to her, she told the Today programme: It’s good to have the flexibility [ie, the option of spending less than 0.7% of national income on aid]. Interestingly, in the legislation as it stands [the bill enshrining the 0.7% target], it does commit to 0.7%, but it does recognise in that legislation that if the economical fiscal circumstances change, then it is open to the chancellor to change that spending. She also stressed the cut was temporary. She told Sky News: Even without the 0.7% this year we will be investing 10 billion and that is really important, but we are in the middle of a pandemic. What we’ve said is of course international aid needs to be spent but we’re going to temporarily cease the 0.7% and bring it back when fiscal circumstances allow. Good morning. Tonight MPs may get the chance to vote on an amendment to the advanced research and innovation agency bill to restore the 0.7% aid spending target next year and, if they do, the Tory rebels supporting it are confident that the government will lose. That is what one of their leaders, David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, told the Today programme this morning. Asked if he was confident that that the government would lose if there were a vote, he replied: Yes, I’m pretty sure. I am certain that there’s a majority of people who want the government to change this policy. Of course the whips do their worst. But I think they will still win. Here is my colleague Patrick Wintour’s overnight preview story. And this is what Patrick tweeted on this this morning. But that does not mean a defeat is inevitable. In fact there are three outcomes that are all quite possible. They are: 1) Ministers could “buy off” the rebels by promising to reverse the aid cut next year. They have already said that the cut (from 0.7% of national income to 0.5%) is only temporary, but there are suspicions that by this Boris Johnson means temporary in the sense that income tax was temporary when William Pitt introduced it to fund the Napoleonic War. 2) The Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, may decide not to put the amendment to a vote. Commons officials have allowed the amendment to be tabled, which suggests that it is within the “scope” of the bill (ie, not irrelevant to the topic it covers). But that does not automatically mean it will be selected, even though a large number of MPs want it put to the vote. The Speaker also has to make a judgment about whether it is relevant to the purpose of the bill, and if he concludes that it isn’t - because it would effectively turn a science research bill into an aid spending bill - he can reject it. 3) The government could push the amendment to the vote, and lose. Although this would be embarrassing for Johnson, there would be two consolatory bonuses: it would stop this issue overshadowing the G7 summit later this week, and it would reinforce Johnson’s claim to be a leader championing the wishes of the public (voters overwhelmingly support the aid spending cut) in the face of obstruction from a supposedly out-of-touch parliament. There are two other outcomes that are less probable. 4) The government could push the amendment to a vote without offering any compromise - and squeak a narrow win. 5) Ministers could abandon the bill altogether. The final option is highly unlikely although, given that the only person in government who was truly committed to setting up the advanced research and innovation agency was Dominic Cummings, Johnson must find the idea tempting. (One reason why he was willing to cut aid spending in the first place, despite the Tory manifesto saying it should stay at 0.7%, was because higher aid spending was a policy associated with David Cameron, another of his arch rivals.) Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: The ONS publishes figures on vaccination rates amongst the over-70s by class. 10.30am: Dr Bola Owolabi, director of health inequalities for NHS England, speaks at a seminar on about vaccine confidence amongst people from African, Bangladeshi, Caribbean and Pakistani backgrounds. 12pm: Downing Street is expected to hold its daily lobby briefing. 2.30pm: Matthew Rycroft, permanent secretary at the Home Office, gives evidence to the public accounts committee about the Windrush compensation scheme. 2.30pm: Priti Patel, the home secretary, takes questions in the Commons. 2.30pm: Sir Keir Starmer gives a speech to the GMB conference. After 3.30pm: MPs begin debating the remaining stages of the advanced research and invention agency bill. The amendment requiring the government to restore the 0.7% aid spending target next year may be put to a vote before 10pm.

Thirty Tories are among MPs to formally back the now defunct amendment, and they are a very mixed bag, ranging from former ministers such as Mitchell, Jeremy Hunt, Tobias Ellwood, Johnny Mercer and David Davis, to senior backbenchers including Bob Neill and Bob Blackman and even a 2019 intake member, Anthony Mangnall. Theresa May is a signatory, and all other living ex-prime ministers – John Major, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and David Cameron – also oppose the aid cut. Why is the government doing this? Mainly, it seems, because it thinks it will be popular. Polling has shown about two-thirds of voters back the move, and there is a particular focus on voters in newer Conservative seats in places such as the north of England and Midlands, who are viewed as more likely to want to focus spending on the UK.","charCount":"3815","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/peterwalker\">Peter Walker</a>

The prospect of stablecoins as a means of payment and the emerging propositions of CBDC have generated a host of issues that central banks, governments, and society as a whole, need to carefully consider and address.</p> <p>It is essential that we ask the difficult and pertinent questions when it comes to the future of these new forms of digital money.”</p> </blockquote> <p>The Bank adds that responses to its recent discussion paper on CBDCs has identified five key issues:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Financial inclusion</strong> should be a prominent consideration in the design of any CBDC. Any CBDC should have a high degree of accessibility to people, regardless of their geographic location in the UK, age, socioeconomic status, digital skills or disability.</li> <li>A <strong>competitive CBDC ecosystem</strong> with a diverse set of participants will support innovation and offer the best chance to deliver the benefits of CBDC. Respondents agreed the Bank should provide the minimum level of infrastructure for the system to be reliable, resilient, fast and efficient. The private sector should take a leading role in responding to the needs of the end users.</li> <li>In assessing the case for CBDC, <strong>the Bank should assess whether non-CBDC payment innovations could deliver the same benefits</strong>. An assessment of the net benefits of CBDC should therefore consider to what extent they can instead be delivered by private sector proposals.</li> <li>A <strong>CBDC should seek to protect users’ privacy</strong>. Feedback from respondents has emphasised the importance that users place on having privacy in their transactions. As with existing forms of digital payments, there are important legal compliance arrangements that CBDC would need to meet, such as anti money laundering, countering the financing of terrorism and sanctions. Subject to meeting these the Bank should therefore seek to ensure that users enjoy a strong level of privacy from any transactions associated with CBDC.</li> <li>While CBDC <strong>should “do no harm” to the Bank’s ability to meet monetary and financial stability</strong>, opportunities to meet our policy objectives more effectively should also be considered in CBDC exploration. The Bank is primarily focused on possible benefits CBDC might bring for ‘payments’. It is also considering the possible opportunities that CBDC may offer for monetary and financial stability.</li> </ol> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60bdec4f8f082e80569f8b99\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-07T10:08:43.324Z\">11.08am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Serviced office group IWG warns on profits</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4e50a47e7935550d6c3ab6e39b74d02db6125e7d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e50a47e7935550d6c3ab6e39b74d02db6125e7d/0_536_2996_1798/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Office space by provider IWG in Spaces Globe Park, Marlow, Britain.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Serviced office provider IWG has already been battered by the pandemic, and the latest Covid-19 variants will mean more pain this year.</strong></p> <p>IWG warned this morning that underlying earnings for this year would be “well below” 2020’s levels, due to the emergence of new, more infections strains such as the Delta variant.<br></p> <p>IWG had been pinning its recovery hopes on the move to flexible working - where people dividing their time between home, and a desk at one of its shared workspaces. </p> <p>But as my colleague <strong>Kalyeena Makortoff</strong> reports, ongoing lockdowns and new variants are hitting IWG’s profits.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The company, formerly known as Regus, reported a<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/mar/09/office-space-iwg-loss-covid-19-hybrid-working\"> £620m annual loss</a> for 2020, when its finances were hit by social distancing rules and work from home orders resulted in empty offices.</p> <p>The UK-listed company, which is headquartered in Switzerland, reported strong recovery in some markets including the US.

The London-listed company, which earns royalties every time one of the 65,000 songs to which it owns the rights is played, said that revenues climbed 66% from $83m (£59m) to $138m in the year to the end of March. Hipgnosis, which spent $1bn buying 84 new song catalogues last year, said the increase in streaming while the live music sector remained shut down fuelled a 50% increase in profits to $107m. “Whilst we would never have wished for a pandemic, it has accelerated the consumption of classic songs through streaming,” said Merck Mercuriadis, the founder and chief executive of Hipgnosis. “With all our catalogues chosen due to their extraordinary success and cultural importance, extra high levels of streaming demand are a natural feature.” Space expert Charles Fishman has written a very interesting Twitter thread about Jeff Bezos’s trip on New Shepard next month, and how it could kickstart the space tourism industry: Speaking of tech firms....France’s competition watchdog has fined Google €220m for abusing its market power in the online advertising industry. The French Competition Authority said Google had unfairly sent business to its own services and discriminated against the competition. The watchdog found that Google’s ad management platform for large publishers - Google Ad Manager - favoured the company’s own online ad marketplace - Google AdX - where publishers sell space to advertisers in real-time. Significantly, Google has agreed to change some of its global advertising practices as well as pay the fine, which could help publishers and other tech companies. CNBC has more details: The investigation found that Google gave preferential treatment to its DFP advertising server, which allows publishers of sites and applications to sell their advertising space, and its SSP AdX listing platform, which organizes auction processes and allows publishers to sell their “impressions” or advertising inventory to advertisers. Google’s rivals and publishers suffered as a result, the regulator said. Isabelle de Silva, president of the French Competition Authority, said in a statement that the decision is the first in the world “to look at the complex algorithmic auction processes by which online advertising ‘display’ operates.” Google says it has agreed on a set of commitments to make it easier for publishers to make use of data, and use its tools with other ad technologies. The FT reckons the French case could provide a blueprint for other ongoing lawsuits against the company, as it “laid out in detail” how Google dominates the world of online advertising: “Google used its vertically integrated business model in display advertising to gain an advantage over other competitors,” said Isabelle de Silva, the president of France’s Competition Authority, at a briefing on Monday. “This is the first investigation in the world that examines the display advertising space where Google is dominant, and the first time Google has agreed to a settlement with engagements. This case will be of interest to other regulators who are looking at the online ad market and technologies.” Shares in the US tech giants are pretty calm in early trading too, shrugging off the G7 tax deal agreed on Saturday. Amazon are down 0.2% (as we report today, it might not even be caught by the new clampdown). Facebook shares are also 0.2% lower, while Apple has dipped by 0.6%. Google owner Alphabet are flat, while Microsoft (whose Irish subsidiary paid no corporation tax on profits of $315bn (£222bn) due to being ‘resident’ in Bermuda) are up 0.4%. Although setting a minimum global corporation tax of at least 15%, as proposed, is progress - ending a long race to the bottom on corporate tax rate - it’s still relatively low (and less ambitious than the original Biden proposal of 21%). And it has yet to be agreed by the G20, so the battle to make global business pay their fair share continues.... Wall Street has opened rather quietly, with the main indices little-changed in at the start of the new trading week: Bloomberg is reporting that De Beers has raised some rough-diamond prices by about 10% this week, after seeing strong demand from buyers. It says the world’s top producer is cashing in on rampant demand from cutters and polishers. Here’s a flavour: The diamond industry roared back to life in the past six months, after stalling at the start of the pandemic last year. Cutting centers in India and Antwerp have been replenishing supplies after they’d been unable to buy during the worst of the crisis. At the same time, demand jumped amid surprisingly good festive sales. That’s created an opportunity for the biggest producers to rapidly escalate prices. De Beers has been increasing since the end of last year and was already back to pre-coronavirus levels. It sold more than $1.6 billion in rough gems in its first three sales of 2021, the most since 2018. The increase at this week’s sale is unusually sharp for De Beers. The miner this week increased the prices for some rough diamonds bigger than 2 carats by about 10%, with other expensive goods rising in high single digits, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified discussing private information. The company also raised the prices of some categories of smaller goods. The luxury market has been notably strong recently. Last month, Cartier owner Richemont reported strong demand for jewellery, with sales exceeding their pre-pandemic levels over the last year. The jump in UK house prices is helping to drive consumer confidence into rosier territory.... ...although not if you’re priced out of buying a property, of course. YouGov’s consumer confidence gauge, released this morning, has jumped to its highest level since April 2016. People are more upbeat about their personal finances, and confident about the future as they look beyond the pandemic. The survey found that: Outlook on job security highest on record at 118.9 Sentiment on house prices continues to improve, with retrospective measure at four-year peak Confidence among households about personal finances at record high, with measure improving by 2.7 in past month and expectations up by 1.5 points Outlook for business activity continues to improve, increasing by 3.8 points Darren Yaxley, Director of Reputation Research at YouGov, said: The growth is yet again driven by confidence in house value as property prices climb to a seven year high, but is also supplemented by huge increases in optimism for job security over the coming twelve months likely due to labour shortages. “With not a single metric decreasing this month, business activity for the past 30 days and outlook for household finances over the next 12 months are the only metrics to show little change. Despite this the metrics are still firmly in the positive showing more Britons are feeling confident than not.” Jeff Bezos is heading where no tech billionaire has gone before, with his brother alongside. The Amazon.com founder, and his brother Mark, will both travel to the edge of space next month on the first human flight operated by his rocket company Blue Origin. In an Instagram post, Bezos wrote that he’s dreamed of travelling to space since he was five: On July 20th, I will take that journey with my brother. The greatest adventure, with my best friend. The Bezos brothers will travel on the New Shepard spacecraft, along with the winner of a multimillion-dollar auction for the final seat - just a couple of weeks after Jeff steps down as Amazon’s chief executive. The flight takes 11 minutes, with the reusable suborbital New Shepard system flying more than 62 miles above Earth beyond the Kármán line (the boundary between Earth’s atmosphere and outer space). That’s high enough to experience a few minutes of weightlessness and see the curvature of the planet before the pressurized capsule returns to earth under parachutes. In the Instagram video clip, Jeff Bezos explains how the flight will be an adventure, and ‘a big deal for me’: To see the earth from space it changes you — it changes your relationship with this planet, with humanity. It’s one Earth. Mark Bezos founded private equity firm HighPost Capital and also works for an anti-poverty charity, and as a volunteer firefighter. He says he didn’t expect his brother to be on the trip - let alone both of them. Lunchtime update: The London stock market is holding its gains, thanks to a strong performance by the housebuilders. The FTSE 100 index is up 20 points, or 0.3%, at 7089 points, with Persimmon (+2.8%), Barratt Development (+2.3%) and Taylor Wimpey (+2%) among the top risers. The smaller FTSE 250 index is has gained 0.35%, with builders Crest Nicholson (+2.8%) and Redrow (+2.7%) among the risers. Construction stocks are a good gauge of UK economic confidence, and Halifax’s prediction that house prices will keep rising will be providing support too. Sophie Griffiths, market analyst at OANDA, says: While miners are trading lower, housebuilders are boosting the index after a stronger-than-expected increase in house prices. The Halifax house price index recorded a 1.3% MoM rise, ahead of the 1.2% forecast. European stock market have shaken off their earlier losses, with the Stoxx 600 now up 0.25%. Campaign group Positive Money have welcomed the Bank of England’s statement that stablecoins should face closer regulation if they become widely used in the UK. Simon Youel, head of policy &amp; advocacy at Positive Money, says users need to be protected from the risks of private money, but would benefit from a BoE-backed digital currency. “With the decline of cash and emergence of private digital currencies, we urgently need a new form of public money in the form of a central bank digital currency, to ensure that we aren’t surrendering the future of money to unaccountable private interests. “A central bank digital currency would open up access to our central bank to everyone, taking away the unique privileges enjoyed by private banks, and ending our reliance on them to manage our money and make payments.” “It is welcome that the Bank of England intends to regulate private digital currencies such as stablecoins to protect users. If stablecoins and cryptoassets are to function as money they should be regulated as such.” Tether, the biggest stablecoin, has a market value of over $60bn, and is pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. In May, it showed that 75% of Tethers were backed by “cash and cash equivalents”, with only 3% backed by actual cash [the FT has a great explanation here] The Bank of England has launched a discussion paper examining the complex, but fascinating, question of central bank digital money and the wider issues surrounding digital currency. And in it, the BoE says that “stablecoins” (digital tokens pegged to a traditional currency, but issued by private firms) should be regulated like payments handled by banks if they start to become widely used. But there’s no decision yet on whether the central bank will launch its own digital currency. In its discussion paper, the BoE says the use of stablecoins as money creates important issues. Any stablecoins that become “systemic” should be stable in value at all times and offer 1-to-1 redemption with a robust legal claim, the Bank says. Stablecoins used as money should meet equivalent standards as those provided by commercial bank money (bank deposits), it continues. Plus, any regulatory model for stablecoins should include ‘a core set of features of the current banking regime’ -- including capital requirements, liquidity requirements and support from a central bank, and a backstop to compensate depositors in the event of failure. The Bank says: New forms of digital money could be preferred by the public to commercial bank deposits, but they will endure only if they can be trusted as a store of value and as an accepted means of payment. This means that stablecoins must promise, credibly and consistently, to be fully interchangeable with existing forms of money. In other words, they must be anchored. This is essential for ensuring that users have the same confidence in stablecoins as commercial bank money. The BBC’s Faisal Islam has tweeted the key points too: The Bank says it hasn’t yet decided whether it will take the plunge and issue its own central bank digital currency, or CBDC (which chancellor Rishi Sunak has nicknamed ‘Britcoin’). But Governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, said the bank is considering it closely. “We live in an increasingly digitalised world where the way we make payments and use money is changing rapidly. The prospect of stablecoins as a means of payment and the emerging propositions of CBDC have generated a host of issues that central banks, governments, and society as a whole, need to carefully consider and address. It is essential that we ask the difficult and pertinent questions when it comes to the future of these new forms of digital money.” The Bank adds that responses to its recent discussion paper on CBDCs has identified five key issues: Financial inclusion should be a prominent consideration in the design of any CBDC. Any CBDC should have a high degree of accessibility to people, regardless of their geographic location in the UK, age, socioeconomic status, digital skills or disability. A competitive CBDC ecosystem with a diverse set of participants will support innovation and offer the best chance to deliver the benefits of CBDC. Respondents agreed the Bank should provide the minimum level of infrastructure for the system to be reliable, resilient, fast and efficient. The private sector should take a leading role in responding to the needs of the end users. In assessing the case for CBDC, the Bank should assess whether non-CBDC payment innovations could deliver the same benefits. An assessment of the net benefits of CBDC should therefore consider to what extent they can instead be delivered by private sector proposals. A CBDC should seek to protect users’ privacy. Feedback from respondents has emphasised the importance that users place on having privacy in their transactions. As with existing forms of digital payments, there are important legal compliance arrangements that CBDC would need to meet, such as anti money laundering, countering the financing of terrorism and sanctions. Subject to meeting these the Bank should therefore seek to ensure that users enjoy a strong level of privacy from any transactions associated with CBDC. While CBDC should “do no harm” to the Bank’s ability to meet monetary and financial stability, opportunities to meet our policy objectives more effectively should also be considered in CBDC exploration. The Bank is primarily focused on possible benefits CBDC might bring for ‘payments’. It is also considering the possible opportunities that CBDC may offer for monetary and financial stability. Serviced office provider IWG has already been battered by the pandemic, and the latest Covid-19 variants will mean more pain this year. IWG warned this morning that underlying earnings for this year would be “well below” 2020’s levels, due to the emergence of new, more infections strains such as the Delta variant. IWG had been pinning its recovery hopes on the move to flexible working - where people dividing their time between home, and a desk at one of its shared workspaces. But as my colleague Kalyeena Makortoff reports, ongoing lockdowns and new variants are hitting IWG’s profits. The company, formerly known as Regus, reported a £620m annual loss for 2020, when its finances were hit by social distancing rules and work from home orders resulted in empty offices. The UK-listed company, which is headquartered in Switzerland, reported strong recovery in some markets including the US. However, occupancy levels across the whole group were lower than expected due to “the prolonged impact of Covid-19, including continuing lockdown restrictions and the emergence of new variants of the virus in some markets”. “Accordingly, this will delay the anticipated recovery in our business and, given the operational gearing of the group, is expected to have a significant impact on the group’s results for 2021,” IWG said, adding that underlying earnings will come in “well below the level in 2020”. Shares in IWG have tumbled almost 13% this morning, to 319p, making it the biggest faller on the FTSE 250 index of medium-size firms. House prices are likely to continue rising for some time despite hitting a new record high in May, one of Britain’s biggest mortgage lenders has said. The monthly snapshot of the property market from Halifax showed a 1.3% jump in the cost of a home in May, taking the average selling price to a record £261,743 as homebuyers raced to complete purchases before the stamp duty holiday begins to run down at the end of this month. Halifax said almost £22,000 had been added to the average house price since May 2020, when the UK experienced the first easing of national lockdown restrictions, and the gradual reopening of the housing market after a temporary freeze. It marks a 9.5% annual increase, the fastest rate of growth in seven years. The report echoes similar findings from a survey by Nationwide last week, which showed prices rising 10.9% year on year, the fastest rate since August 2014. Here’s the full story: The average UK house price has jumped by more than £22,000 over the past 12 months, and by £3,000 in May alone, Halifax’s data shows. That puts the housing ladder further out of reach for many first-time buyers -- undermining the new 95% mortgage guarantee scheme launched this spring. Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, says: ‘Cheap borrowing and affordability is giving buyers more purchase power, which is pushing up prices. Lenders remain keen to lend and have plenty of cash to do so, resulting in ever-lower mortgage rates from sub-1 per cent. However, lenders aren’t only targeting those with big deposits or similar levels of equity in their homes, with options also increasing for first-time buyers at 95 per cent loan-to-value and the first properties being sold under the government’s First Homes initiative. This is just as well given that rising property prices are not good news for first-time buyers, and will make getting on the housing ladder even more of a struggle.’ Here’s Bloomberg’s take on the UK housing boom: U.K. house prices grew at their strongest pace in almost seven years as consumers unleashed pent-up savings to gain more space after coronavirus lockdowns, Halifax Building Society said. Prices grew 1.3% in May, driving the annual pace of growth to 9.5%, the mortgage lender said in a statement on Monday. That put the average cost of a home at £261,743 ($369,895). The report confirmed findings of Nationwide Building Society, which also showed prices growing at the fastest since 2014. The market is benefitting from a temporary tax-break on property purchases, a buildup in savings by consumers and confidence in recovery from the virus. Covid-19 travel restrictions might also keep house prices hot this summer, reckons Lucy Pendleton, property expert at independent estate agents James Pendleton. The housing market usually takes a breather over the summer months, as some potential buyers head off on holiday. But this year, most popular overseas destinations are the UK’s ‘amber’ or ‘red’ lists (meaning arrivals must quarantine), and France is restricting non-essential travel from the UK altogether. So more people will be at home...and perhaps looking to move house instead. Pendleton says: “The inability of Britons to go on holiday means there’s no distraction now from executing that ambitious move to a larger home. We’re entering a time of year when school holidays and foreign trips normally force the market to drop to a slightly slower pace. “That’s not necessarily going to happen this year and sustained, strong demand over the next few months could have ramifications when the market cools in the autumn, delivering on paper what might look like a more rapid slow down. She also argues that the relatively sluggish figures for London (annual growth of 3.1%) don’t tell the full story. House price growth in the capital is not exceptional as a whole, but it is still being powered by the same race for space that is driving the national market. Many buyers just can’t get what they want within budget after a relatively strong decade of gains. Location has become less important and space more so. UK estate agents predict that the housing market might cool slightly after May’s boom, as the stamp duty freeze is being reduced at the end of the month (from £500k to £250k). Guy Gittins, CEO of Chestertons saw “exceptional transaction volume” in May with three times more buyers than usual, and viewings running at a 5-year high for the past three months. As the Stamp Duty Holiday threshold drops to £250,000 from 30 June to 30 September and then returns back to normal levels from 1 October, we predict new buyer registrations to slightly decrease.” George Franks, co-founder of London-based estate agents, Radstock Property, says the government’s ‘meddling’ has pumped up prices. “May was a month of two halves. The first half was extremely busy as there was still a chance to purchase before the June Stamp Duty deadline. The second half of May and first week of June have been quieter, perhaps due to sunny weather, half term or everyone fleeing to Portugal. More likely, though, it is because there is no urgency as people have resigned themselves to missing the Stamp Duty deadline. “Buyers now appear to be waiting to see what happens to the market after the end of June, possibly in the hope that prices will start to fall. This is especially the case in the sub-£800k bracket. It might take a few months to see how things pan out from July onwards. It will not be as simple as reducing asking prices, or indeed offers, by £15,000, as the Stamp Duty holiday was about sentiment as much as money and the fundamentals remain strong. “I don’t believe the property market is in a bubble, but it has certainly benefited from Government meddling in the form of the Stamp Duty holiday and mortgage guarantee scheme. We’ve effectively had two years rolled into one due to Government intervention. Looking forward, the fundamentals have not changed, namely money is cheap, it’s still cheaper to own than to rent and there is a profound lack of stock.” Jeremy Leaf, north London estate agent, says the market is calming down slightly, but still “very busy on the ground”. We notice too from connected chains that activity is even stronger in areas outside London where affordability is greater. ’Those who have little chance of making the stamp duty deadline are already considering ways of negotiating their way to completing transactions. We expect activity to settle but not drastically change in the next few months.’ The UK housing boom is running particularly hot in Wales, and parts of the North of England. Halifax’s data shows that Wales has seen the biggest surge in house prices, with the average property costing 11.9% more than a year ago. Two other regions have recorded double-digit growth: the North West (+10.6%) and Yorkshire &amp; Humber (+10.2%), outpacing the average annual rise of 9.5% (the fastest since 2014). For Wales and the North West, these are the biggest percentage gains since April 2005, Halifax says, and for Yorkshire &amp; Humber its the biggest jump since June 2006. But the South of England, particularly London, are lagging. Halifax MD Russell Galley explains: This likely reflects a weakness in city prices given the shift in preference for properties with more space, whilst recent surcharges on stamp duty for non-UK residents and Brexit concerns will also have weighed on the capital’s market. UK house prices have risen to a new peak, as the stamp duty holiday and the stampede for larger houses following the pandemic continues to fuel the market. Halifax reports that the average property now costs £261,743, with annual house price inflation at its strongest level in almost seven years (on its index). According to Halifax, the average price rose by 1.3% in May alone, and was 9.5% higher than a year ago. Several factors seem to be driving prices sharply higher, Halifax says. One is the government’s extended freeze on stamp duty payments, which is reduced from £500,000 at the end of June, and ends three months later. Plus, the savings build up by more prosperous families during lockdown; rising demand for homes better suited to home-working; and a shortage of properties on the market. Russell Galley, managing director of Halifax, explains: “Heading into the traditionally busy summer period, market activity continues to be boosted by the government’s stamp duty holiday, with prospective buyers racing to complete purchases in time to benefit from the maximum tax break ahead of June’s deadline, after which there will be a phased return to full rates. For some homebuyers, lockdown restrictions have also resulted in an unexpected build-up of savings, which can now be deployed to fund bigger deposits for bigger properties, potentially pushing property prices even higher. Galley also predicts that prices could keep rising: Whilst these effects will be temporary, the current strength in house prices also points to a deeper and long-lasting change as buyer preferences shift in anticipation of new, post-pandemic lifestyles – as greater demand for larger properties with more space might warrant an increased willingness to spend a higher proportion of income on housing. These trends, coupled with growing confidence in a more rapid recovery in economic activity if restrictions continue to be eased, are likely to support house prices for some time to come, particularly given the continued shortage of properties for sale.” In London, mining stocks are under pressure following the slowdown in China’s exports. Commodities giant Anglo American (-2%), copper producer Antofagasta (-1.5%) and precious metal producer Fresnillo (-1.4%) are the top fallers. Weaker export growth could indicate less demand for raw materials such as iron ore, copper, coal, nickel and zinc. But the wider FTSE 100 is up 0.2%, or 13 points, at 7082 points. UK focused companies are in the risers, including housebuilders, banks such as Barclays (+1.9%), telecoms operator BT (+1.8%) and Royal Mail (+1.8%). Neil Wilson of Markets.com says investors are waiting for US inflation data later this week, for fresh signals as to when America’s Federal Reserve might slow its stimulus programme. The FTSE 100 is the only early riser as European equity markets opened the week broadly in the red as Chinese trade data maybe just weighed a touch with exports lower than forecast despite imports growing at the fastest clip in 10 years. In London, housebuilders led gains while basic resources stocks fell. Asian shares were mixed, US futures are slightly weaker this morning. It’s a light data docket today – all eyes on the inflation data from the US later in the week alongside the upcoming ECB meeting. Last week’s US Non-Farm Payroll report (showing fewer new jobs than expected) seemed to calm inflation worries, Wilson points out: Friday’s jobs report was something Goldilocks-like: not too cold to douse confidence in the economic recovery in the US, but also not so hot as to make the Fed take its feet off the gas too early.... Inflation remains squarely in focus and the largest potential source of investors angst and market volatility this week. April’s CPI print jumped to 4.2%, the highest since 2008. The month-on-month increase in the core reading of 0.9% was the strongest since 1982. Given this, the monthly core reading will be the main focus as it will offer a guide on just how transitory or otherwise the pop in inflation is likely to be. European stock markets have begun the new week in the red. The pan-European Stoxx 600 has dropped by 0.3%, away from last week’s record high. Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC are both down almost 0.4%. In Frankfurt, chipmaker Infineon Technologies (-1.3%) and chemicals firm Linde (-1.3%) are among the fallers, along with takeaway operator Delivery Hero (-2%) and energy firms RWE (-1.1%) and Siemens Energy (-1.6%). The bad news for manufacturers, and consumers, is that the global shortage of semiconductors won’t end soon. Singapore’s Flex, one of the world’s largest electronics contract manufacturers, has warned that it will take at least a year for supplies to catch up with demand, the Financial Times reports this morning. That would mean more delays and disruption for industries around the world, such as carmakers and technology manufacturers. And it’s likely to result in higher prices, with factories already reporting that input costs are rising extremely rapidly this year. The FT says: A rapid rebound in vehicle sales combined with a lockdown-driven boom in games consoles, laptops and televisions has left the world’s chipmakers overwhelmed by the sharp increase in demand. Singapore-based Flex has more than 100 sites in 30 countries and manufactures devices and electronics for companies including Ford, British household appliances designer Dyson, UK online grocer Ocado and US computer and printer maker HP. Its position in the supply chain makes it a large buyer of chips. Lynn Torrel, Flex’s chief procurement and supply chain officer, said that the manufacturers it relies on for semiconductors have pushed back their forecasts for when the shortage will end. “With such strong demand, the expectation is mid to late-2022 depending on the commodity. Some are expecting [shortages to continue] into 2023,” she said. The German factory orders report also shows that real turnover in manufacturing fell by 2.6% in April, compared with March. That could be another sign that supply shortages are hampering the sector, as Germany tries to return to growth after suffering a 1.8% contraction in the first quarter of 2021. Oliver Rakau of Oxford Economics tweets that bottlenecks appear to be hurting German industry: German factories have reported a drop in orders - another sign that supply shortages are causing ructions. New manufacturing orders at Europe’s largest economy dropped by 0.2% month-on-month - missing forecasts of a 1% gain (according to a Reuters poll). The weakness was driven by a drop in domestic orders, which fell by 4.3%, while overseas orders rose by 2.7% month-on-month, the Economy Ministry reported. Orders for intermediate goods (products designed to be used in a finished item) fell 1.0%, while capital goods inched by by 0.2% and new orders for consumer products rose by 1.4%. Bloomberg says it’s a sign that supply shortages and higher prices are undercutting Germany’s economic recovery, adding: Manufacturing has been a stronghold in Europe’s largest economy over the past months, benefiting from earlier recoveries in places such as China and the U.S. Lately though, businesses have run into unprecedented supply-chain issues amid shortages of parts and raw materials. Reuters also highlights how China’s export growth may have been hit by disruption at some major ports: “Exports surprised a bit on the downside, maybe due to the COVID cases in Guangdong province which slowed down the turnover in Shenzhen and Guangzhou ports,” said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, adding that turnover at ports in Guangdong will likely remain slow in June. Major shipping companies warned clients of worsening congestion at Shenzhen’s Yantian port in Guangdong province after the discovery of several cases among port staff. On the ground in Guangdong, factories have yet to report widespread capacity cuts over the outbreak but admitted efficiency issues as they tried to meet overseas demand. Chen Linsheng, COO at Anlan, a Shenzhen-based manufacturer of skincare and beauty-care devices, told Reuters while there was no impact on production, staff are now subject to a series of COVID tests and not allowed back into the factory without a negative result. “We are not allowed going out (of the city). We need to report in advance and cannot even go to Guangzhou or Foshan on our own,” said Chen, adding that a lot of meetings have moved back online. More here: China’s imports grow at fastest pace in decade as materials prices surge Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The global chip shortage, rising raw material costs and creaking supply chains are all weighing on the global economy as it tries to recover from the shock of the Covid-19 pandemic. And new trade data from China suggests these factors are now biting into growth. China’s exports slowed in May, growing by 27.9% year-on-year, down from 32.3% in April. That’s weaker than economists had expected. It suggests the sharp recovery from the pandemic may be slowing -- due to ongoing Covid-19 disruption, and deepening problems getting hold of semiconductors. Imports surged by 51.1% in May - the fastest jump in a decade. But that growth in import values was fueled by surging commodity prices in the scramble for metals and fuel, which is creating concerns about rising inflation. Iris Pang of ING says China’s car industry was hurt by the shortage of semiconductors: The main reason for the shortfall is that all export items related to semiconductor chips have slowed. Auto processing products and parts, the biggest export item, fell 4%YoY in terms of export value. This is most likely the result of the semiconductor chip shortage. Pang also points out that recent Covid-19 outbreaks are also hitting trade. which could drive up consumer prices in the shops. Since the end of May, there have been around 10 Covid cases daily in Guangdong, where most electronics factories are located. Shipments from the port in Shenzhen that process most of the electronic throughput have been affected by Covid. Port workers now have to have Covid tests and port operations have been disrupted. Some factories in Guangdong were also affected by Covid, mostly caused by workers queuing up for testing. As such we expect June trade and production data will be affected. This could push up prices of electronic goods in general and affect China’s export prices and eventually import prices in the US and Europe. Supply chains in Asia will also likely be disrupted. More here: China: Exports slow but imports jump Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, said while import prices increased at a rapid pace, import volumes probably edged down in May. “Once again, supply constraints are partly to blame – inbound shipments of semiconductors continued to drop back. So too did imports of industrial metals.” Commodity prices have dipped following the data, with traders anticipating that future demand may be slower than expected Also coming up today Experts are digesting the deal on a minimum global corporation tax rate of 15%, agreed by leading finance ministers on Saturday. The G7 also agreed that countries should have the right to tax the largest, most profitable multinationals’ profit in the locations where it is generated, a landmark moment. But Amazon could escape paying this clampdown on the “largest and most profitable multinational enterprises”, due to its low profit margins. Richard Murphy, visiting professor of accounting at the Sheffield University management school, said the 10% profits threshold was “inappropriate” because of different business models for different companies. He added that current approaches to reporting profits in each country were “easily gamed”. “This could turn out to be a false hope unless they get the detail right.” Mortgage lender Halifax’s latest house price index is expected to confirm that prices have surged around 10% in the last year.

A poll of 11 countries conducted by the German Marshall Fund and the Bertelsmann Foundation found that Washington’s handling of the pandemic diminished many European’s views of the United States, particularly in France and Germany. “The first three months of the Biden administration have not affected French and German views of US influence in the world,” the study said. US research papers released in March talk about how the US under Donald Trump could have avoided nearly 400,000 deaths with a more effective strategy. Nearly 600,000 Americans have died from Covid-19 since the start of the pandemic. Within the United States, since Biden has taken office, many seem to lean toward the perception that US influence abroad has risen, the survey found. While most Americans consider the European Union as a reliable partner, only 51% of Germans see the US as one. In France, the number is 60%, and 67% in the United Kingdom. Fewer than a quarter of Turks trust the United States. Republican Alabama Representative Mo Brooks has been served with a lawsuit filed by Democratic California Representative Eric Swalwell accusing him and other allies of Donald Trump of instigating the 6 January attack on the US Capitol. Swalwell’s legal team, which has already served Trump, Donald Trump Jr and Rudy Giuliani with the lawsuit, had stated previously that they had been having trouble getting in touch with Brooks.

The important thing is the complaint has been served and Mo Brooks can now be held accountable for his role in inciting the deadly insurrection at the Capitol.” In his rush to accuse Swalwell’s team of entering his house unlawfully, however, it appears that Brooks also tweeted out his gmail passwords and his pin, which were written on a sticky note attached to his computer. Jen Psaki, Biden’s White House press secretary, went on CNN’s Reliable Sources to talk about Fox News, Newsmax and other rightwing outlets. She likened them to “propaganda pushers” and “representatives of the Russian and Chinese media asking questions directed by their government.” “The things that get under my skin are when the premise of a question is based on inaccurate information, misleading information,” she said. Psaki also defended the Biden administration against criticism for holding only one presidential press conference: “That may be driven more by the media than it is by the American public,” she said. The Supreme Court has declined to review a lawsuit challenging the country’s male-only draft registration policy as unconstitutional. Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote essentially that Congress should take the lead on the issue on whether all genders should be required to register with the Selective Service System at age 18 and be considered for military service should a draft be called up again. While the Trump administration had defended the policy, Joe Biden’s acting solicitor general Elizabeth B. Prelogar had advised the court not to take up the issue because Congress was considering including women in the draft registration, the Washington Post reports. In case you missed it, Democratic West Virginia senator Joe Manchin took out a column in the Charleston Gazette-Mail on Sunday to say that he would be opposing the For the People Act. “I believe that partisan voting legislation will destroy the already weakening binds of our democracy,” wrote Manchin, who was considered a key vote to counter efforts by Republicans in state government to restrict voting rights. Reaction was swift. Manchin also used the column to reiterate his support of the filibuster, which gives 41 of 100 senators the ability to block action by the majority. Democrats have argued that Republicans have repeated used the filibuster to support minority positions - last month, they used it to block the creation of a bipartisan, 9/11-style investigatory commission on the attack on the US capitol. A study by the Center for American Progres found that Republicans used filibusters roughly twice as much as Democrats to prevent the other party from passing legislation. For a hot second this weekend, the Internet united as everyone lost their minds over a possible theory that Donald Trump may have worn his pants backwards at the North Carolina Republican Party’s state convention on Saturday night. Images and video from his speech that appeared to show a lack of a fly at the front, as well as some odd wrinkling, had Internet sleuths questioning Trump’s fashion’s choices - and #TrumpPants trending on Twitter. But after reviewing 90 minutes of footage, Snopes declared that the theory was false. Greetings, live blog readers. We kick off the week with Joe Biden gearing up for the first overseas trip of his administration. Leaders are scheduled to begin arriving in Cornwall for the G7 summit on 11 June. In addition to having discussions about the global health system, the climate crisis, trade and tax havens at the 47th summit, Biden is expected to meet with Boris Johnson to affirm the US’s “special relationship” with Britain. He, accompanied by Jill Biden, will then go on to meet the Queen at Windsor Castle on 13 June. Biden will meet Vladimir Putin in Geneva on 16 June, the first meeting after a cyber-attack, believed to have originated from Russia, took out meat-processing factories across the US. Secretary of State Tony Blinken told Axios that the meeting is “not in spite of” the cyber-attacks, but “because of them.” Meanwhile, vice president Kamala Harris is in Guatemala for her first foreign trip as well, where she’s expected to focus on economic development, climate and food insecurity and women’s issues. She’s scheduled to fly to Mexico on 8 June.","charCount":"6634","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/vivian-ho\">Vivian Ho</a>"},{"headline":"Mercedes team principal Wolff labels team’s performances ‘unacceptable’ ","standfirst":"<ul><li>Mercedes failed to score any points in Azerbaijan Grand Prix</li><li>Lewis Hamilton’s late error cost him likely second place</li></ul>","trailText":"The Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, has expressed his frustration and anger at the team’s recent performances after failing to score any points in the Azerbaijan Grand Prix","byline":"Giles Richards","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d7e186d7ee460928df3fd3c5f128371edb35e0c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d7e186d7ee460928df3fd3c5f128371edb35e0c7/171_0_5130_3078/1000.jpg\" alt=\"World champion Lewis Hamilton\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lewis Hamilton was left frustrated after a costly mistake late in the Azerbaijan Grand Prix.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Istitene - Formula 1/Formula 1/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>The Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, has expressed his frustration and anger at the team’s recent performances.

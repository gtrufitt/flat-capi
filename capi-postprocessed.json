And, in a parallel universe, the former US president mysteriously refers to some election somewhere with which this outlet is unfamiliar. The election we’re familiar with is this one: We’re waiting for a press briefing at the White House by Jen Psaki, but for the moment, let us bring you a summary of the main events so far today. Facebook has announced that Donald Trump will continue to be suspended from the social media platform for two years and will only be reinstated “if conditions permit”. Russian president Vladimir Putin issued a warning today: ransomware hacking allegations from the United States are a deliberate attempt to provoke a confrontation between the US and Russia. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Christopher Wray, the director of the FBI, compared the recent spate of ransomware attacks to the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center. Joe Biden is continuing talks with the Republican side today in an attempt to win bipartisan agreement on key legislative pieces stuck in Congress. Facebook has announced that Donald Trump will continue to be suspended from the social media platform for two years and will only be reinstated “if conditions permit”. Today’s decision comes just weeks after input from the Facebook oversight board – an independent advisory committee of academics, media figures and former politicians – who recommended in early May that Trump’s account not be reinstated. However the oversight board punted the ultimate decision on Trump’s fate back to Facebook itself, giving the company six months to make the final call. The former president has been suspended since January, following the deadly Capitol attack that saw a mob of Trump supporters storm Congress in an attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. The company suspended Trump’s Facebook and Instagram accounts over posts in which he appeared to praise the actions of the rioters, saying that his actions posed too great a risk to remain on the platform. Following the Capitol riot, Trump was suspended from several major tech platforms, including Twitter, YouTube and Snapchat. Twitter has since made its ban permanent. We’ll bring you more reaction and developments but you can also follow the full story as it unfolds here. Here’s a link to the decision as issued by Facebook itself. And here’s the column from last month from former Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger, who is a member of the oversight board that upheld FB’s ban, #ICYMI. Russian president Vladimir Putin issued a warning Friday: hacking allegations from the United States are a deliberate attempt to provoke a confrontation with the United States, per Reuters: President Vladimir Putin said on Friday that hacking allegations which some have linked to Russia were an attempt to provoke a political dispute ahead of a summit with US President Joe Biden on June 16, Interfax news agency reported. He also said that he expected his summit with Biden, which is set to take place in Geneva, to be held in a positive atmosphere, though he anticipated no breakthrough. Tensions between the two countries have been simmering for some time. Recall that in April the Biden administration issued new sanctions against Russia over cyberespionage: The Biden administration on Thursday announced sanctions against Russia for its involvement in a recent major cyber espionage operation against the US, foreign influence operations around US elections and other concerns. As part of an executive order signed by President Biden, the administration through the Treasury Department will block US financial institutions from purchasing bonds from Russia’s Central Bank, National Wealth Fund or Ministry of Finance after June 14 and from lending funds to these institutions. The directive also leaves open the possibility for the administration to expand the sanctions on Russian sovereign debt. Additionally, the Biden administration is expelling 10 personnel from the Russian diplomatic mission in Washington, some of whom US officials say are representatives of Russian intelligence services. One of the more crucial policy points for Joe Biden during his trip to meet with G7 leaders will be over a global minimum tax CNN has more. CNN’s Julia Horowitz explained the dynamics: The Biden administration’s ambitious plan to overhaul the global tax system is about to face a crucial test. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen heads to a meeting of Group of Seven finance ministers in London on Friday and Saturday looking to build support from many of the world’s top economies — an important step in the administration’s efforts to rewrite international tax rules and discourage American companies from booking earnings abroad. G7 finance ministers are expected to back the US plan during the summit, according to a Reuters report citing a US Treasury official. Washington’s proposal will likely get a full endorsement when G7 leaders including President Joe Biden gather in the United Kingdom next week, the news agency reported. Last month, the US Treasury proposed a global minimum tax of at least 15%, aiming to tackle an unwieldy international system rife with loopholes. Establishing a minimum rate could help discourage companies from shifting their profits to countries where they would pay less tax. More and more Republicans have been calling for Dr. Anthony Fauci’s resignation, citing a trove of emails recently released to the public. Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri released one such statement this morning. It’s unlikely Fauci will resign or that Joe Biden will ask for Fauci’s resignation though. He said today he still is “very confident” in the chief medical adviser to the president. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Christopher Wray, the director of the FBI, compared the recent spate of ransomware attacks to the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center. Here’s his comments in the Journal: FBI Director Christopher Wray said the agency is investigating about 100 different types of ransomware, many of which trace back to hackers in Russia, and compared the current spate of cyberattacks with the challenge posed by the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. “There are a lot of parallels, there’s a lot of importance, and a lot of focus by us on disruption and prevention,” Mr. Wray said in an interview on Thursday. “There’s a shared responsibility, not just across government agencies but across the private sector and even the average American.” Mr. Wray’s comments—among his first publicly since two recent ransomware attacks gripped the U.S. meat and oil-and-gas industries—come as senior Biden administration officials have characterized ransomware as an urgent national-security threat and said they are looking at ways to disrupt the criminal ecosystem that supports the booming industry. Each of the 100 different malicious software variants are responsible for multiple ransomware attacks in the U.S., Mr. Wray said. Cyberattacks are something the president plans to bring up when he meets with Russian president Vladimir Putin. Earlier this week Biden told reporters that his administration is looking “closely” at possibly retaliating against Russia over ransomware attacks. “Responsible states do not harbor ransomware criminals,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said recently. The Texas Tribune throws out the possibility that Allen West could be gearing up to challenge incumbent governor Greg Abbott, a Republican. Here’s the Tribune: West has not ruled out challenging Gov. Greg Abbott, and he has also had tension recently with Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick. A former Florida congressman who moved to Texas several years ago, West took over the party last summer, unseating incumbent James Dickey. He quickly made a name for himself for his willingness to speak out against fellow Republicans, including Abbott, whose coronavirus response he criticized. West used the latest legislative session to push hard for the party’s eight legislative priorities, and he has spent recent days lamenting the lack of progress that lawmakers have to show on them. It’s important to note that Abbott is a popular politician in Texas and has recently touted Donald Trump’s endorsement. He also won his last gubernatorial election by 13 percentage points. Unseating Abbott would not be easy. The jobs report numbers out today were overall positive. My colleague Dominic Rushe has more: The US added 559,000 jobs in May as the coronavirus pandemic receded, shaking off fears of a substantial slowdown in hiring after April’s disappointing monthly report. The Bureau of Labor Statistics said Friday that the unemployment rate had fallen to 5.8% from 6.1% in April, still significantly higher than the 3.8% unemployment rate recorded in February 2020 before Covid 19 hit the US but less than half its 14.8% peak in April last year. The news comes one month after the labor department shocked economists by announcing the US had added just 266,000 new jobs in April – far below the 1m gain that had been expected. April’s report led to sparring between the Biden administration and Republicans who claimed higher levels of unemployment benefits were keeping people from returning to work. There are signs of a strong rebound across the US economy. Worker filings for unemployment benefits have dropped by 35% since late April and fell to a pandemic low of 385,000 last week, the labor department said Thursday. Former congressman Allen West, the ex-Florida member of Congress-turned chairman of the Texas Republican Party, is stepping down from his post. He had been leading the Texas Republican Party for less than a year, a short tenure for a chairman to abruptly end. There seems to be some confusion about the timing of when his departure will go into effect. While the vice chair of the party tweeted that West is stepping down at 5pm. today the party’s communications director tweeted that West will keep his job until early July. Here’s a press release announcing West’s departure. Good morning readers, Daniel Strauss here. Let’s get started. Joe Biden continues to find a deal with Republicans and conservative members of the Democratic party elusive on the primary legislative initiative his administration is focusing on. Later today, Biden is meeting with Senator Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia. It’s the latest meeting between the president and the lead Republican negotiator over a major infrastructure funding package. Despite repeated counter offers by Capito and her team of Senate Republicans, the White House and Congress have not gotten close to a compromise. And that’s caused Biden and his top aides to warn that time is running out to come up with a bipartisan deal. But there are persistent fissures within the Democratic Party as well. In an interview with CNN, Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, the most conservative Democrat in the Senate caucus and the most outspoken conservative Democrat on Capitol Hill, warned that he’s not ready to give up on a bipartisan compromise. Per CNN: In an interview with CNN on Thursday, Manchin said bipartisan infrastructure talks should continue even as pressure builds for Democrats to move ahead without Republicans, and he dismissed calls to create a special carveout from the Senate’s filibuster rules to pass a voting overhaul bill along straight party lines, a key priority for Democrats that faces stiff opposition from GOP lawmakers. Manchin heads into a pivotal time for Congress where a number of key policy issues are on a razor’s edge in the Senate, giving the swing Democrat enormous sway over the future of the Biden agenda. At the centerpiece of that agenda is the infrastructure package that Biden and Republicans are furiously negotiating in a last-ditch attempt to cut a compromise, though they remain far apart. The West Virginia Democrat is not ready to give up on those talks with Republicans quite yet, saying: “These (things) take time.” Manchin’s comments underscore one of the more persistent aspects of Congressional gridlock that’s continued through the Biden administration: a small, moderate sect of the Democratic Party opposes the drastic go-it-alone approach other wings of the party are pushing for on a range of issues – from filibuster reform in the Senate to an infrastructure deal.","charCount":"12458","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/daniel-strauss\">Daniel Strauss</a> in Washington"},{"headline":"Spain v Portugal: international friendly – live!","standfirst":"<ul><li>Live coverage of Friday’s friendly match in Madrid</li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2021/jun/04/euro-2020-complete-guide-to-all-622-players-ratings\">Euro 2020: your complete guide to all 622 players</a><br></li><li>Email <a href=\"mailto:scott.murray@theguardian.com\">scott.murray@theguardian.com</a> with any thoughts</li></ul>","trailText":"<strong>Rolling report:</strong> Spain host Portugal for a friendly clash between two favourites for Euro 2020.

The dam thus broken, there’s a fair chance they’ll retain their title, their squad including Bruno Fernandes, Joao Cancelo, Ruben Dias, Diogo Jota, Andre Silva, and, to give him his full title, 36-Year-Old Cristiano Ronaldo.</p> <p><strong>If they manage it, they’ll become only the second nation to keep hold of the </strong><strong><em>Coupe Henri Delaunay</em> … Spain being the first. </strong>The Euro 2008 and Euro 2012 winners are the joint most successful country in European Championship history, also having won in 1964; fellow three-time victors Germany pip them on countback, having more runners-up finishes to their name. Few would be too surprised if they reclaim their crown next month and make it four, with a squad filled with the likes of Aymeric Laporte, Jordi Alba, Pau Torres, Sergio Ramos, Cesar Azpilicueta, Thiago, Rodri, Adama Traore and Ferran Torres.</p> <p><strong>Other potential winners are available, but these are the two we’ll be watching tonight.</strong> Their last meeting was a 0-0 friendly draw in Lisbon last October; let’s hope tonight’s game is a bit more like the one before that, the sparkling 3-3 draw in Sochi at the last World Cup.

That was lovely football from the three-time European champs. 9 min: Rui Patricio takes his own sweet time over a clearance, much to the pantomime annoyance of the crowd. 8 min: Spain have established control of this game quickly. Plenty of passes in the old-school style, some tiki here, a bit of taka there. Put it together, and they’re probing with purpose down both flanks. 6 min: Jota comes in from the left and is upended unceremoniously by his Liverpool team-mate Thiago. No favours here. 5 min: Torres looks lively. He spins infield from the right and glides into the Portugal box. Fonte sticks out a leg and puts a stop to his gallop with a well-time tackle. 3 min: A long pass down the Spanish right. Ferran Torres gets on the end of it, cutting back to ... nobody in particular. But that’s a promising start for the hosts, who found the Portuguese defence wide open. 2 min: It isn’t too long before Busquets comes sliding through Danilo. Welcome to the Wanda. Spain get the party started, in front of 20,000 fans. They’re back, baby! Spain are in their furious red, while Portugal sport second-choice teal. The teams are out. Apologies for the late arrival of this MBM, we had a few technical issues to iron out. Everything’s been switched off and back on again, and here we are. Hey, this sort of tardy foolishness is in the grand tradition; one of Granada TV’s first foray into live coverage missed the first four minutes of a European Cup semi featuring the Busby Babes. They had ads to show, and people needed that sweet, fresh hit of Gibbs SR. We’ll be off in a minute or two. Spain: Simon, Marcos Llorente, Laporte, Pau Torres, Gaya, Thiago, Busquets, Fabian, Sarabia, Morata, Ferran Torres. Subs: de Gea, Azpilicueta, Diego Llorente, Koke, Gerard, Garcia, Rodri, Jordi Alba, Olmo, Oyarzabal, Gonzalez, Sanchez. Portugal: Rui Patricio, Nelson Semedo, Pepe, Fonte, Guerreiro, Sergio Oliveira, Danilo Pereira, Sanches, Ronaldo, Joao Felix, Jota. Subs: Lopes, Joao Moutinho, Andre Silva, Bruno Fernandes, William Carvalho, Rafa Silva, Neves, Goncalves, Nuno Mendes, Joao Palhinha, Rui Silva. Referee: Craig Pawson (Dear old Blighty). Welcome to some hot bonus MBM action, hand-crafted with precision tools to whet your appetite for the upcoming Euros. It’s a friendly between Spain and Portugal. They’re Iberian rivals, two of the best teams in the world … and the two most recent winners of the European Championship. ¡Esta encendido! Está ligado! Portugal are the reigning champions of Europe. Euro 2016 was their first-ever major title, and since then they’ve added the inaugural Nations League in 2019. The dam thus broken, there’s a fair chance they’ll retain their title, their squad including Bruno Fernandes, Joao Cancelo, Ruben Dias, Diogo Jota, Andre Silva, and, to give him his full title, 36-Year-Old Cristiano Ronaldo. If they manage it, they’ll become only the second nation to keep hold of the Coupe Henri Delaunay … Spain being the first. The Euro 2008 and Euro 2012 winners are the joint most successful country in European Championship history, also having won in 1964; fellow three-time victors Germany pip them on countback, having more runners-up finishes to their name. Few would be too surprised if they reclaim their crown next month and make it four, with a squad filled with the likes of Aymeric Laporte, Jordi Alba, Pau Torres, Sergio Ramos, Cesar Azpilicueta, Thiago, Rodri, Adama Traore and Ferran Torres. Other potential winners are available, but these are the two we’ll be watching tonight. Their last meeting was a 0-0 friendly draw in Lisbon last October; let’s hope tonight’s game is a bit more like the one before that, the sparkling 3-3 draw in Sochi at the last World Cup. Kick off at Atletico Madrid’s Wanda Metropolitano is at 6.30pm BST, 7.30pm local. It’s on!","charCount":"5240","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/scottmurray\">Scott Murray</a>"},{"headline":"School leaders say pupils should vaccinated as matter of priority","standfirst":"<p>Call follows the approval of Pfizer jab for 12-to 15-year olds and Delta variant outbreaks in English schools</p>","trailText":"Call follows the approval of Pfizer jab for 12-to 15-year olds and Delta variant outbreaks in English schools","byline":"Richard Adams and Sarah Boseley","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e06fdcc07923c081230179c8c6ef1f4e8839a7ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e06fdcc07923c081230179c8c6ef1f4e8839a7ab/0_516_7742_4648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pupils wear face coverings in school corridors. \" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Union leaders said vaccinating students would benefit their safety but also minimise further disruption to their educations.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>School leaders are calling for pupils to be vaccinated as a matter of priority <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/04/uk-regulator-approves-pfizer-covid-vaccine-for-12-to-15-year-olds\">after UK regulators approved a jab for 12- to 15-year-olds</a> and data showed outbreaks of the Delta variant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/jun/03/india-covid-variant-spreading-in-englands-schools-and-colleges-data-shows\">in schools throughout England</a>.</p> <p>The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority (MHRA) on Friday gave its approval for the use of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in children aged 12 to 15, paving the way for its use among all but the youngest secondary school pupils.</p> <p>But a decision on whether it will be rolled out to children, and when, will fall to the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) and ultimately ministers.</p> <p>Teaching union and school leaders said that starting a vaccination programme for teenagers soon could mean most secondary pupils would receive two doses by the time schools begin the new term in September, minimising the risk of further disruption to their education.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/jun/04/the-pros-and-cons-of-giving-covid-vaccines-to-uk-children\">The pros and cons of giving Covid vaccines to UK children</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On Friday, new government-commissioned research showed that a decade’s worth of progress in reducing<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/jun/04/covid-has-eradicated-disadvantaged-pupils-progress-finds-study\"> the attainment gap for disadvantaged children</a> could have been eradicated during the pandemic.</p> <p>But some scientists warned it could be unethical to prioritise jabs for children, who are at extremely low risk of serious illness from Covid, given the small risk of side-effects and as vaccine rates remain low in many other countries. </p> <p>It comes after the Delta variant was shown to be spreading in schools in small but growing numbers, with 140 incidents reported so far.</p> <p>After the approval of the Pfizer vaccine for children, Hamid Patel, chief executive of the Star Academies trust based in Blackburn, said: “This is very welcome news.

The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority (MHRA) on Friday gave its approval for the use of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in children aged 12 to 15, paving the way for its use among all but the youngest secondary school pupils. But a decision on whether it will be rolled out to children, and when, will fall to the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) and ultimately ministers. Teaching union and school leaders said that starting a vaccination programme for teenagers soon could mean most secondary pupils would receive two doses by the time schools begin the new term in September, minimising the risk of further disruption to their education. On Friday, new government-commissioned research showed that a decade’s worth of progress in reducing the attainment gap for disadvantaged children could have been eradicated during the pandemic. But some scientists warned it could be unethical to prioritise jabs for children, who are at extremely low risk of serious illness from Covid, given the small risk of side-effects and as vaccine rates remain low in many other countries. It comes after the Delta variant was shown to be spreading in schools in small but growing numbers, with 140 incidents reported so far. After the approval of the Pfizer vaccine for children, Hamid Patel, chief executive of the Star Academies trust based in Blackburn, said: “This is very welcome news. We now need to ensure that all teenagers have received at least the first jab before the summer holidays. “Schools are best placed to accommodate vaccinations and the infrastructure is already in place for delivering inoculations. We will get much higher take-up if we ask youngsters to receive the jab in term time rather than when they are enjoying their holidays. This will also enable all of us to have a safer, freer and more normal summer.” Patel, whose multi-academy trust includes more than 30 schools across England, including in Bolton, Manchester and Blackpool, added: “With infection rates surging among teenagers in some areas of the country, it is vital to prioritise schools in these hotspots. This will help manage and eradicate current infection outbreaks.” Union leaders called on the JCVI – which advises the government on setting vaccine group priorities – to seriously consider offering doses to younger teenagers.

Use of the Pfizer version for young teenagers has already been approved by US authorities. Pfizer has reported 100% efficacy in the 12 to 15 age group, meaning none of the children in the trials developed Covid symptoms. But some experts urged caution.

For the time being, we should not be extending our Covid vaccination programs to include children,” he said. In the US, Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, urged parents to vaccinate their children after the publication of new research. “I am deeply concerned by the numbers of hospitalised adolescents and saddened to see the numbers of adolescents who required treatment in intensive care units or mechanical ventilation,” Walensky said. The study found that nearly a third of teenagers hospitalised with Covid earlier this year required intensive care, while 5% required mechanical ventilation. Data published by Public Health England (PHE) revealed for the first time that 140 outbreaks of the Delta or Indian variant had been recorded in schools in England, with cases overall rising last month following the relaxation of mask-wearing in schools. But campaigners said that PHE and the government needed to publish more details about the spread of Covid within schools, including numbers of infections in each location rather than only outbreaks. A pressure group named The Citizens said it had served legal notice on PHE and would begin proceedings for a judicial review unless PHE published the more detailed figures.","charCount":"5559","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/richardadams\">Richard Adams</a> and <a href=\"profile/sarahboseley\">Sarah Boseley</a>"},{"headline":"Barclay family calls truce to end Ritz espionage case in high court","standfirst":"<p>Sir Frederick Barclay settles case against nephews over alleged secret bugging of hotel’s conservatory</p>","trailText":"Sir Frederick Barclay settles case against nephews over alleged secret bugging of hotel’s conservatory","byline":"Rupert Neate Wealth correspondent","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"10cffc58a447e0d2757d7a253dace78dc12bcf1e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10cffc58a447e0d2757d7a253dace78dc12bcf1e/0_6_5000_3001/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The London Ritz hotel sign\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sir Frederick Barclay has reached a settlement with his nephews, who he was suing over the alleged secret bugging of the Ritz’s conservatory.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Jackson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>The billionaire Barclay family has declared a truce to end a high court battle over alleged “commercial espionage on a vast scale” that included the bugging of thousands of private conversations at the five-star Ritz hotel.</p> <p>Sir Frederick Barclay announced on Friday that he had reached a settlement with his nephews, who he was suing over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/24/frederick-barclay-was-secretly-recorded-at-ritz-high-court-hears\">the alleged secret bugging of the Ritz’s conservatory</a>, where he regularly held meetings with his daughter Amanda.</p> <p>“We are pleased that as a family we can put this difficult period behind us and now look forward to our future together,” the family said in a joint statement, which was first reported by the Financial Times. “In these troubled times, unity within families is more important than ever.

The studies, published on Friday by the Department for Education (DfE), also show significant regional disparities in the impact of the disruption to schooling caused by Covid, with pupils in some parts of northern England losing twice as much learning over the same periods as those in London. It prompted renewed calls from teaching unions for more investment in catch-up efforts, two days after the government’s education recovery chief, Sir Kevan Collins, resigned in protest at what he called “half-hearted” ministerial plans. The research was carried out by the Education Policy Institute (EPI) thinktank in English primary and secondary schools during the autumn term of last year, and spring 2021, using the metric of months of attainment lost for reading and maths. While it found that overall attainment suffered notably during both periods when the bulk of pupils were learning from home, with some recovery when students returned last autumn, the effect was magnified because of disadvantage and location. By October in last autumn’s term, average learning losses for primary students were 3.7 months for maths, and 1.8 months for reading. But for disadvantaged pupils, the average was 4.3 months of maths and two months for reading. A similar effect was found for secondary students. While the most recent data for learning loss among disadvantaged children, gauged in March, has not yet been published, the report’s authors said there were signs of a growing gap. Overall, they said, it appeared to have undone between a third and two-thirds of all progress made in the past decade. There were also notable regional differences, although the researchers urged some caution on these due to smaller sample sizes. One set of data found that in last year’s autumn term, primary children overall had lost 1.3 months of reading attainment in London and 1.5 months in the south-west of England, but 2.3 months in the north-east and 2.6 months in Yorkshire and the Humber. Jon Andrews, head of analysis at the EPI, who co-authored the research, said it had uncovered “a clear penalty faced by disadvantaged pupils during the pandemic”, which risked widening the overall gap in educational attainment, and significant regional disparities. “We need to continue to look at how we can support all pupils through effective catch-up programmes, but especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, whose education has seen the most damage from the pandemic.” he said. “It is also important that policies address the large losses seen in certain parts of the country.” The same point was made by teaching unions, who were highly critical of the DfE’s catch-up plan, announced on Wednesday, which provided funding for extra tuition and other measures – but, at £1.4bn, was about a tenth of what Collins had proposed in his plan. Paul Whiteman, general secretary the NAHT, which represents school leaders, said that while there was the “silver lining” in the report of learning loss being reduced when pupils were fully in school last autumn, the research showed the need for an ambitious recovery package. He said: “It is becoming increasingly clear that disadvantaged pupils have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic, and we are starting to see regional disparities too. That’s why the government’s failure to back its own catch-up tsar’s plans for support this week was such a disappointment.” Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “It is abundantly clear that a recovery programme is urgently required at a scale and scope to address this massive issue. “Instead, we have seen this week a package of measures from the government that is lacking in ambition, inadequately funded and which has caused the education recovery commissioner to resign in protest.”","charCount":"4022","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/peterwalker\">Peter Walker</a> Political correspondent"},{"headline":"Somerset v Hampshire, Glamorgan v Lancashire and more: county cricket – live!","standfirst":"<ul><li>Rolling coverage of all the action from around the grounds</li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2021/jun/03/yorkshire-v-sussex-essex-v-notts-and-more-county-cricket-day-one-live?page=with:block-60b9287e8f082e80569f567d#block-60b9287e8f082e80569f567d\">Thursday’s report: Sussex’s Brown frustrates Yorkshire</a><br></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2021/jun/04/england-v-new-zealand-first-test-day-three-live\">England v New Zealand: first Test, day three – live!</a></li><li><a href=\"mailto:tanya.aldred.freelance@theguardian.com\">Email Tanya</a> with any thoughts | Tweet <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tjaldred\">@tjaldred</a></li></ul>","trailText":"<strong>Rolling report: </strong>Join Tanya Aldred for live coverage of the action around the grounds in the County Championship","byline":"Tanya Aldred","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"df1aca69acf5d9e16b9433b0c159088eb6da0401\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df1aca69acf5d9e16b9433b0c159088eb6da0401/0_132_3613_2169/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Roelof van der Merwe of Somerset looks to make his ground as Ian Holland of Hampshire kicks the ball towards the stumps. \" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roelof van der Merwe of Somerset looks to make his ground as Ian Holland of Hampshire kicks the ball towards the stumps. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Harry Trump/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<div id=\"block-60ba62fa8f08b9889b3691db\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-04T17:33:59.982Z\">6.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Just popping back between editions</strong> to say it’s very tight at Sophia Gardens, and Worcestershire are looking vulnerable at New Road despite the best efforts of Jake Libby.

Well batted Dawid Malan, well batted Gary Ballance, making it look easy at Headingley, and a hero-gram for six-wicket Callum Parkinson. That’s it from me for today, Graham will be here tomorrow at Headingley. Good night! 98 overs due tomorrow. I’d better concentrate on the round-up for a bit, I’ll leave you with Glamorgan strolling to 43 without loss, needing another 145 to beat Lancashire. Fifties for Miles Hammond at Gloucestershire 58 not out, and for Dawid Malan at Headingley, where he and Gary Ballance have put on 81 for the third wicket. Yorks 176-2 Durham all out 381. They’re becoming batting specialists. Tongue 4-73. Worcester, I’m afraid, are in deep trouble needing 251 to make Durham bat again. I haven’t been watching at New Road - has the pitch changed from the minefield it was on Thursday (at least in Worcester’s mind.) Does anyone know why the flush isn’t working? I suppose I better go and find out. In other news, Glamorgan are 25-0, a couple of fours each for Cooke and Lloyd. Group one Derby: Derbyshire 121 v Warwicks 274 and 26-3 Chelmsford: Essex v Notts 248-6 no play today, rain Worcester: Worcester 131 all out v Durham 369-9 Group two Grace Road: Leicestershire 451 v Gloucestershire 85-2 Taunton: Somerset 360 all out v Hampshire 157-6 Group three Sophia Gardens: Glamorgan and 0-0 v Lancashire 173 and 164 Glamorgan need 188 to win Canterbury: Kent v Northamptonshire 362-5 no play today, rain Headingley: Yorkshire 153-2 v Sussex 313 all out Rain, rain and more rain at Chelmsford, with large puddles developing at the River End. Essex need the points more than group-leaders Notts. Sam Northeast has gone at Taunton for a hard-working 67 as Tom Abell makes a crucial breakthrough. Hampshire continue to edge forward, just 206 behind. They’ve taken tea at Sophia Gardens, with the promise of an entertaining run-chase to toast day. Invaluable nurdling from Saqib Mahmood and Danny Lamb at the end. Neser 4-53, two each for Lamb and Douthwaite. Northants knew what they were up to yesterday, banging out four bonus points while the sun shone. Pennington back in the wickets at New Road, with numbers 7 and 9. Durham lead by 219. Warwickshire are a-crumbling in their second innings. Currently 5-2 after four overs, with Pieter Malan and Will Rhodes’s afternoon closed. The lead 159. Teenage kicks: Yorkshire 130-2. Follow on NOT enforced by Warwickshire, who bat again with a first-innings lead of 153. Meanwhile Sam Northeast has tacked together a valuable fifty at Taunton, paying what I think they described as a “holding-role” in football. Hampshire 124-5. Not many centuries this round (Brown, Harris and Bedingham, I think), but another beauty from Bedingham who is providing welcome heft to the Durham middle order. The lead over Worcestershire now 202. The last wicket stand added a sixth of the runs after a collapse of 8-45. Norwell 4-24, Miles 5-30. Will they follow on? We wait.... Still no play at Kent, Chelmsford or Lord’s. For balance, the top ten leading wicket-takers this season: Rushworth (Durham) 37 Coverton (Somerset) 36 Fletcher (Notts) 36 Abbott (Hants) 34 Harmer (Esses) 34 Higgins (Gloucs) 33 Sam Cook (Essex) 32 Carse (Durham) 32 Olly Robinson (Sussex) 29 Bamber (Middx) 28 [Broad has 19 from four games, Wood 10 from three games, Anderson 3 in two games but one innings] Hampshire 110-5, as James Hildreth at slip says thank you to a softly-dropping plum from Liam Dawson. Ah! Thank you Gary. O youth! The strength of it, the faith of it, the imagination of it! Ibrahim strikes with ball. Kohler-Cadmore lbw for 25. Yorkshire 83-1. Like a moonlit shadow, Derbyshire dance where Lancashire tread. From 76-2 to 98-7. Craig Miles 4-26, Norwell 2-20. A breakthrough at Taunton! James Vince is caught at backward point after an uncharacteristically patient 29. Hampshire 100-4. I’ve learnt that Dan Ibrahim is now the youngest player to make fifty on debut in the Championship. The previous record was held by Bilal Shafayat - who in my mind played a Test for England, but my mind is wrong. Cricinfo confirms U19 England caps and a glorious season in 2005 when he made 1000 runs for Notts. Gosh Lancashire really are, um, getting a move on. They’ve now lost 5-11, with Vilas and Bailey joining the heavy pavilion-trudge. Three for Neser, one for Douthwaite and a run out. Currently, 125-8, a lead of 148. That run-out : And a reminder of the owner of that mellifluous welsh voice: Eddie Bevan of course. Thank you! Hopes of a tea-start at Lord’s Glamorgan’s statement on welcoming fans back to Sophia Gardens: We welcome today’s announcement from the Welsh Government of a return of spectators to watch live events in Wales this summer. The two metre social distancing regulation will restrict our capacity to a maximum of 2,892 and we will continue to work closely with key partners including the Welsh Government, Public Health Wales, and Cardiff City Council on a safe return of fans to Sophia Gardens. We have prepared and submitted proposals for a phased return of fans to Sophia Gardens from next week and look forward to providing more information as soon as the necessary approvals have been confirmed. Once again, we would like to thank our members, fans and partners for their patience and look forward to welcoming supporters back to Sophia Gardens in greater numbers. Gary Naylor confirms a Lancs-up in progress. Here’s the first of the three to fall since lunch: A post-lunch trickle: Madsen and McDermot shot out by Miles (3-23) at Derby: 82-4, 192 behind Warwicks. Chris Wright picked off by Hammond at the run-fest at Grace Road, Leicestershire 439-8. Oh dear, and Lancashire have lost 3-4 at Sophia Gardens: Bohannon, Livingstone, and Wood run-out without facing a ball. Lancs 113-6. Just watered the garden for the first-time in a while, cautiously optimistic about the soft-fruit season. Talking of which... ah, no-one has collapsed in the ten minutes since lunch. Group one Derby: Derbyshire 61-2 v Warwicks 274 Chelmsford: Essex v Notts 248-6 no play before lunch Worcester: Worcester 131 all out v Durham 252-4 Group two Grace Road: Leicestershire 436-7 v Gloucestershire Taunton: Somerset 360 all out v Hampshire 67-3 Group three Sophia Gardens: Glamorgan 150 all out v Lancashire 173 and 88-3 Canterbury: Kent v Northamptonshire 362-5 no play before lunch Headingley: Yorkshire 26-0 v Sussex 313 all out Godleman straggles back to the Derby pavilion after being caught behind for 32. Derby 61-2 shortly before lunch. At Headingley, the Yorkshire openers are still whole, if with an uneven scorecard. Kohler Cadmore one not out; Lyth 16 not out including a morning heave-ho for six! Yorks 22-0. David Bedingham is the only man with more than 700 runs this season - and still he bats. Currently 65 not out at New Road as Durham sail into a sobering lead: 241-4, a lead of 112 over Worcestershire. Al Davies and Luke Wells steaming along at Sophia Gardens, but Keaton Jennings’ more circumspect innings is over. Lbw to Weighell for 12. A bump down to earth in this game after his classy hundred last week. Lancashire 72- hang on, they’re now 72-2. Wells bowled for 26 by Douthwaite. Sussex all out 313! Now Yorkshire get a go. Will it be the Yorkshire of the first innings of the Roses match -159 all out - or the Yorkshire who battled to so-close to the bitter end in the second innings? This is just showing off! Gloucestershire having a spell in the doldrums. Leicester now 411-7, with a helpful 47 extras. And, in case this appeals: No dream debut for Ibrahim, but dreamy enough. Well played, young pup. Sussex 310-8. Lunch will be taken at 1pm at Lord’s, where the rain continues to pour. Hampshire, meanwhile, are in trouble: 31-3 after de Lange removes Steel and Alsop in one over. Holland already gone, caught VDM off Davey. Just perusing the Championship averages as if it was 1985 and they were taking up a whole page in the Telegraph. The highest England players are 7th placed Ollie Pope (78.83) and 8th placed Rory Burns (53.73) Top ten: Van der Merwe, Somerset Bedingham, Durham Carlson, Glamorgan RS Patel, Surrey MS Harris, Leicestershire Vasconcelos, Northants Pope, Surrey Burns, Surrey MAH Hammond, Gloucestershire Abell, Somerset Derbyshire have lost their first wicket, 8-1, but Durham billow onwards, Beingham and Jones steadfast in a partnership of fifty. Their lead over Worcestershire an almost commanding 53, with six wickets remaining. The lovely voice of the Glamorgan commentator is lulling me into a trance, but can report that at Derby Warwickshire are all out for 274, an impressive effort by Derby, who are already batting and 7-0. There will be an inspection at Canterbury at 12.20. How’s that on debut?! Seven fours and as calm as a tarn on an early spring morning. Ticket offer!!!

Except at Canterbury, Chelmsford and Lord’s where the rain doth spout and spoil things. Some fabulous reading from the Test. I thought this was brilliant on Ollie Robinson by Andy Bull. On a morning of cloud cover so heavy that the Headingley floodlights were switched on, and 2,056 souls planted their behinds around the ground for the first time for a men’s county game since 2019, Yorkshire chose to bowl. With Sussex 68 for four just after lunch, it seemed a good decision.

Peter Siddle finished with three for 76. Sam Hain (77) and Michael Burgess (71) kept Warwickshire afloat on a muggy day at Derbyshire. Sam Conners had the top order in a pickle, taking the first four wickets, before the middle-order solidified to see them towards 272 for nine at stumps.

It’s trying to eradicate racism from society and bring equality where there’s racial disparity which cuts across economic divides. “But statues are a symbol of how seriously our cities in Britain are actually taking these issues.” Sobers described putting the Colston statue on display as an opportunity to tell a wider history and encourage people to speak about it. “It’s been toppled, it’s been laid on its back in a warehouse for a year and we want it to be a very transparent display to say this is how it is, this is what we’re working with, and we want to ask what happens next.” The display at M Shed forms the first part of the public consultation, with a survey also launched for people to provide their views on the future of the statue and of how Bristol’s history is told.","charCount":"4077","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/damien-gayle\">Damien Gayle</a>"},{"headline":"The Guardian view on the Wigmore Hall: happy 120th birthday","standfirst":"<p>It may seem staid – to some.

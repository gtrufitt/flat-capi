Job creation was the strongest for over six years, but backlogs of work accumulated to the greatest extent since the summer of 2014. </p> <p>“The successful vaccine roll out has generated a strong willingness to spend and fortified business optimism across the service economy. However, inflationary trends intensified in May as suppliers passed on higher transport bills, staff costs and raw material prices. Imbalanced demand and supply appears to have spread beyond the manufacturing sector, which contributed to the steepest rise in prices charged by service providers since the survey began in July 1996.” </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60b897ad8f082e80569f4c17\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-03T08:49:51.740Z\">9.49am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\"> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jun/03/activist-hedge-fund-seat-exxonmobil-board-engine-no-1-fossil-fuels\">Activist fund expected to win third seat on ExxonMobil board</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60b8914e8f082e80569f4bcc\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-03T08:34:41.160Z\">9.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Eurozone services sector growth highest since 2018</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Services firms across the euro area have posted their strongest growth in almost three years.</strong></p> <p>With economies reopening from the lockdown, firms reported an increase in output growth, and a rise in volumes of new business for the first time since last July, date firm IHS Markit reports.</p> <p>Backlogs of work rose, encouraging companies to take on additional staff for the fourth month running -- with employment rising at the fastest rate since February 2020 </p> <p>This lifted Markit’s Eurozone services PMI to 55.2 in May, up from 50.5 in April, and the highest level in almost three years.</p> <p><strong>Ireland </strong>and <strong>Spain </strong>reported the fastest services growth, followed by <strong>France</strong>, while <strong>Germany </strong>recorded the slowest expansion. </p> <p>The wider eurozone private sector grew at its fastest pace since February 2018, Markit adds, due to strong growth in the manufacturing.

Today’s services PMI report shows that payroll numbers rose at the fastest pace since March 2015, with survey respondents citing a combination of new hires and the return of employees from furlough. Many companies reported difficulties with staff availability, especially among consumer service providers, Markit says. And with labour in short supply, some companies are paying higher salaries -- a boost to workers. The PMI report says: Tighter labour market conditions and subsequent rises in salary payments added to cost pressures across the service economy in May. Duncan Brock, Group Director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, says a shortfall of talent is driving up pay. Businesses rushed to increase their operational capacity to meet this demand but were struggling to fill their job vacancies. As staff moved on to other opportunities following the pandemic’s impact on lives and priorities, a potential skills gap in the sector means some firms may struggle to meet their new goals. This shortfall in talent meant the best candidates were increasingly in demand and demanding higher wages, adding to the highest inflationary rise in business costs since July 2008. We will see more pressure for salary rises, as basic living becomes more expensive for everyone as the hike in prices charged by service companies was the highest since 1996.” The UK economy is enjoying “eye-popping” growth as services companies see a surge in demand after lockdown restrictions were eased. Activity at UK service providers jumped in May at the fastest rate in 24 years, according to the latest survey of purchasing managers at UK services firms. Companies reported resurgent business and consumer spending last month, with new orders rising at the fastest pace since October 2013. This encouraged them to take on more staff, with the strongest rate of employment growth for just over six years. Backlogs of work also built up due to a jump in forward bookings, stretched capacities and staff shortages. Covid-19 restrictions were eased in mid-May, meaning that pubs and restaurants could serve indoors. Other other hospitality venues also reopened. This followed the earlier reopening of non-essential shops in April. But this jump in demand is also pushing costs up. Input price inflation reached its highest since July 2008, and companies raised their own prices at the fastest rate since the survey began in 1996. This lifted IHS Markit’s Services PMI up to 62.9 in May, from 61.0 in April. Any reading over 50 shows growth, and this level implies the economy is growing extremely fast after contracting in the first quarter of the year. Its suggests the fastest rate in business activity since May 1997 -- the month in which Tony Blair became prime minister. Tim Moore, economics director at IHS Markit, says the successful Covid-19 vaccine rollout is boosting the economy, and implying very strong growth this quarter. “UK service providers reported the strongest rise in activity for nearly a quarter-century during May as the roll back of pandemic restrictions unleashed pent up business and consumer spending. The latest survey results set the scene for an eye-popping rate of UK GDP growth in the second quarter of 2021, led by the reopening of customer-facing parts of the economy after winter lockdowns. “Pressure on business capacity due to a spike in demand and staff hiring difficulties emerged as a major challenge for service sector companies in May. Job creation was the strongest for over six years, but backlogs of work accumulated to the greatest extent since the summer of 2014. “The successful vaccine roll out has generated a strong willingness to spend and fortified business optimism across the service economy. However, inflationary trends intensified in May as suppliers passed on higher transport bills, staff costs and raw material prices. Imbalanced demand and supply appears to have spread beyond the manufacturing sector, which contributed to the steepest rise in prices charged by service providers since the survey began in July 1996.” Services firms across the euro area have posted their strongest growth in almost three years. With economies reopening from the lockdown, firms reported an increase in output growth, and a rise in volumes of new business for the first time since last July, date firm IHS Markit reports. Backlogs of work rose, encouraging companies to take on additional staff for the fourth month running -- with employment rising at the fastest rate since February 2020 This lifted Markit’s Eurozone services PMI to 55.2 in May, up from 50.5 in April, and the highest level in almost three years. Ireland and Spain reported the fastest services growth, followed by France, while Germany recorded the slowest expansion. The wider eurozone private sector grew at its fastest pace since February 2018, Markit adds, due to strong growth in the manufacturing. Ireland posted the strongest PMI since the survey began 21 years ago. London estate agent Foxtons is also bouncing back from the pandemic. Foxtons told the City that trading momentum has remained strong since its last trading update on 14 April, with sales running ahead of pre-Covid levels. Following a 49% increase in Foxtons Q1 sales revenue versus both 2020 and 2019, the sales commission pipeline has continued to grow and is now 65% ahead of last year and 17% up on 1 January 2021. As a result of the strong trading momentum, adjusted operating profit for the first half of the year is expected to be significantly ahead of both 2020 and 2019. Foxtons faced a shareholder backlash in April, with 44% of investors failing to back its remuneration report after it awarded CEO Nic Budden almost £1m in bonuses, despite taking £4.4m of furlough money and £2.5m in business rates relief. The London stock market has dipped in early trading, dropping from yesterday’s three-week highs. The blue-chip FTSE 100 index is down 47 points or almost 0.7% at 7060 points. Retail stocks are lower, with discounter B&amp;M down 1.7% despite reporting that pretax profits doubled last year after it stayed open during the lockdown. B&amp;M reported that “trading continues to be volatile at a weekly and product category level, in particular since the recent easing of lockdown restrictions.”. DIY chain Kingfisher are down 2.6%, after going ex-dividend this morning (it’s too late to qualify for the next payout to shareholders). National Grid also went ex-divi today; they’re down 4.7%. Travel companies are among the fallers too, with British Airways parent company IAG down 2.5%. Budget airline easyJet have dropped 2.8% (on the smaller FTSE 250 index), amid reports that Portugal could potentially be removed from the UK’s green list, which allows travellers from those countries into England without having to self-isolate on arrival. The government is set to announce revisions to the travel traffic-light system on Thursday, but Whitehall sources expect just a “handful of new places” to be given quarantine-free travel – few of which are tourist destinations... Growth at China’s service sector companies slowed slightly last month. The Caixin services PMI, which racks China’s services firms, fell to 55.1 in May, down from 56.3 in April. That still shows rapid growth, with business activity and new orders up sharply -- but softening compared to April. Caixin says the Covid-19 pandemic appears to have hit exports last month. According to panel members, customer demand continued to recover due to the successful containment of COVID-19 in China, while there were also reports of new product offerings boosting sales. The resurgence of the virus in other regions across the world weighed on new export business, however, which fell for the third time in four months (albeit only slightly). The jump in petrol prices won’t alarm those who have made the switch to electric cars. Converting fossil fuel cars to electric is one option - and former football ace David Beckham has now taken in interest. He’s bought a 10% stake in Lunaz, a Silverstone-based company that electrifies classic cars from Rolls-Royce, Jaguar and Range Rover. Lunas is also planning to use the same technology on bin lorries, and other commercial vehicles. My colleague Jasper Jolly went to see them yesterday for a spin, and reports: Lunaz is part of a small but growing trend of the new battery economy: ripping out polluting engines and installing batteries and electric motors with zero exhaust emissions. The attraction for Beckham became clear during a Guardian test drive on Wednesday afternoon alongside the famous Silverstone race track in the well-upholstered back of a 1961 Rolls-Royce Phantom. Electric motors may lack the engine roar beloved of petrolheads, but the smooth, quiet ride they offer is well suited to the more rarefied atmosphere of chauffeur-driven luxury. At first glance the plush interior could have been hand-upholstered 50 years ago, but wooden charge and power dials tell a different story. New cars powered solely by petrol or diesel engines will be banned by 2030 in the UK, but the government is unlikely to order classic cars off the road, whatever their emissions, while London’s ultra-low emissions zone exempts historic vehicles. Yet there is still growing demand for upgrades in the car market. Workshops are springing up around the country that cater to this new class of customer as batteries finally reach the point where they can be slotted in to older models. The technology is there, but financially, it is likely to be some time before conversions of mass-market cars are within reach. Lunaz charges for classic models start at £245,000 for a Range Rover, putting it within the reach only of the very wealthy. For a historic Rolls-Royce those prices are £350,000 and upwards – very far upwards, judging by the range of bespoke options on offer. One or two new electric motors take up much less space than an engine, allowing Lunaz to squeeze in custom-made batteries and whatever newer technologies customers need, from air conditioning to electric windows, phone chargers and in-built TVs.... More here: Analysts predict that the oil price will continue to rise, as the relaxation of travel restrictions and other curbs are eased. Norbert Rucker, analyst at Swiss bank Julius Baer, explained: The strong demand dynamics and likely delays in the Iran nuclear deal negotiations pushed oil prices above the much-watched $70 per barrel level,” said “We expect oil prices to move well beyond $70 per barrel towards mid-year. Stephen Brennock of oil broker PVM also believes the market could absorb supply increases: “The market is optimistic that growing summer travel and reopening economies will easily accommodate additional OPEC+ production increases and even a possible Iranian return to the market.” CBA commodities analyst Vivek Dhar said in a note this week that demand from drivers was picking up too. “The U.S. driving season is a period that sees higher‑than‑normal fuel consumption. UK traffic is now sitting above pre‑pandemic levels. “We continue to see the oil demand recovery led by the U.S., Europe and China.” Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The oil price has hit a new two-year high, with demand increasing as economies emerge from lockdown, and producers keep supplies curbed. Brent crude has hit its highest level since May 2019 this morning, hitting $71.99 per barrel, having settled at a two-year high overnight. It’s now more than recovered from its slump early in the pandemic: US crude is catching up fast too - hitting $69.40 per barrel, its highest since October 2018. The rally comes after the Opec+ group agreed to maintain its slow easing of production cuts, and as negotiations continue over the Iranian nuclear deal - which could result in oil sanctions being lifted. Opec+ struck an optimistic tone about improving demand this week, which helped lift oil - even though it stuck to its policy of slowly relaxing production cuts. Saudi Arabia’s energy minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, predicted a demand recovery in China and the US in the coming months, with vaccine rollouts helping to rebalance the oil market. And overnight, US crude inventory figures showed a larger-than-expected drop in crude stocks - signaling rising demand, as the peak driving season looms in the US. With European economies reopening after their pandemic lockdowns (although new Covid-19 variants could yet derail these plans), fuel demand could strengthen. And that would potentially push inflation higher in the coming months too. Naeem Aslam, analyst at Avatrade, explains: Basically, traders are feeling a lot more optimistic about the reopening of the global economy and the continuation of the vaccination process. In addition to this, if we look at oil supply, it seems like major oil producers are very much maintaining their discipline. Traders also understand that the US and Iran’s nuclear deal cannot be reinstated that easily, and it will take a while before the previous conditions are enacted. This means no immediate increase in oil supply, and this is also supporting oil prices. Also coming up today The latest services sector PMI reports are expected to show strong growth in the UK, eurozone and the US....and probably intensifying price pressures as well. The latest US jobless claims data will be closely watched, ahead of tomorrow’s Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) jobs report for May - which may show a rebound in hiring after April’s slowdown. We also get the monthly assessment of US private sector payrolls, from ADP. Markets are looking calm, with investors cautious ahead of Friday’s NFP. But that doesn’t extend to the ‘meme stock’ world. Yesterday, a frenzy of trading in Reddit favourites saw cinema chain AMC Entertainment’s stock double to new record highs. AMC is expected to benefit as lockdown measures are rolled back, and people return to the cinema. It also launched a new platform for its sizable retail investor base - which includes a free large popcorn when attending a movie at AMC this summer. But even so, the rally is quite remarkable given the company’s pandemic struggles - sending the firm’s value soaring over $30bn (meaning more pain for the speculative hedge funds betting against it). As Bloomberg explains: The moonshot surge in the shares of AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. has vaulted it into the ranks of some of the world’s most valuable companies. The company has gone from a small cap to a large cap in the space of a few months. A 95% gain amid a retail-trading frenzy on Wednesday left the movie-theater chain with a market capitalization of $31.3bn. That makes it more valuable than half of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 Index. AMC is now worth more than Tyson Foods Inc. and Delta Air Lines Inc. despite projections for the company to bring in a fraction of their revenues.

Scott Morrison said on Thursday the disaster payment would be available in areas declared a commonwealth hotspot when any lockdown lasted longer than seven days. A $500 weekly payment will be available for people who work more than 20 hours a week, while $325 will be available for those who work less than that. Separately, the federal and Victorian governments are close to reaching an agreement over a new quarantine centre to be built at Avalon. A memorandum of understanding has been sent from Canberra to Melbourne and it’s expected an agreement will be finalised on Friday to coincide with a meeting of national cabinet. Federal government sources have said while it is not a done deal yet, it’s very close. Two cases previously linked to the Victorian outbreak were declared false positives on Thursday evening by an expert panel that reviews test results for the health department. The cases were a woman initially thought to have contracted the virus at a Metricon display home in Mickleham and a man incorrectly believed to have been infected at the Brighton Beach hotel. “These cases will be reclassified and no longer considered confirmed cases,” the health department said. The disaster payment announced on Thursday will only go to people older than 17, who were working before the lockdown and who can no longer work. They will need to have less than $10,000 in savings. There are further restrictions including whether other leave – beyond annual and sick leave – is available to cover the lockdown period.

There were three new local Covid cases in Melbourne officially reported on Thursday including a previously announced case in the Arcare Maidstone aged care facility.

Morrison said which level of government would fund the new disaster payment would be discussed at national cabinet on Friday. He said two options were on the table: first, for the state government to pay for business support, as Victoria has done, and the commonwealth to fund individual income support; or alternatively, for the federal and state governments to split the total cost. Speaking before the PM’s announcement, Merlino said his preference was for the state to cover business support and the commonwealth to handle income support. “The state responsibility is supporting Victorian businesses and we have done that with almost half a billion [dollars] of support and we will provide further support,” he said. “The federal government [should provide] income support for workers, that is solely their responsibility, and it would be disappointing if they walked away from that.” The federal treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, said the Treasury and finance department were working to cost the temporary Covid disaster payment.

Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon will use a four-nations summit with the Prime Minister on Thursday to push for the job retention scheme to continue beyond its current September expiry date. Now Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove has indicated it could be continued. Asked about the possibility of this, he said: “We are open minded, yes.” Speaking ahead of the four-nations summit on tackling Covid, Gove said the initiative, which sees the taxpayer pay cash towards workers’ wages, had been a “huge success” that was only possible “thanks to the broad shoulders of the UK Treasury”. The UK government minister insisted higher spending as a response to the coronavirus pandemic would continue, as the country as a whole seeks to “build back better”. The Scottish government has voiced concerns about a possible return to austerity from the Conservatives at Westminster, but Gove told BBC Radio Scotland’s Good Morning Scotland programme: We’ll be spending more. We’ll be spending more on the NHS, we will be spending more on education, we will be spending more on criminal justice, because in all of these areas it is absolutely vital that we build back better. Extra funding for everyone will continue, and it is important we all learn from each other about how that money should be spent. His comments come ahead of a virtual coronavirus recovery summit involved Johnson and the leaders of the devolved governments in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast. The rearranged meeting was due to take place last week but was postponed after the first ministers of Wales and Scotland pulled out because they wanted it to be a “meaningful discussion with substantive outcomes”. Both Sturgeon and Mark Drakeford subsequently wrote to the prime minister asking for more substance and clarity about the summit. There is growing speculation that popular holiday islands could be added to the government’s travel green list on Thursday. Spanish and Greek islands plus Malta are among the destinations which experts believe may be given green status. That would mean people visiting those locations from the UK will no longer be required to quarantine on their return. Robert Boyle, former director of strategy at British Airways’ parent company IAG, predicted that a number of summer hotspots will be added to the green tier. He wrote in a blog post: It still seems very likely that whilst Spain and Greece will not make it onto the green list, many of their islands will, due to lower case rates and higher vaccinations than on the mainland. Malta, Finland and Slovakia are fairly safe bets, based on high testing rates and low reported cases. Paul Charles, chief executive of travel consultancy The PC Agency, said a number of popular holiday destinations “really deserve” to be moved to the low-risk tier. He expects additions to the green list to include the Greek islands of Zante, Rhodes and Kos, the Caribbean islands of Grenada and Antigua, plus Malta and Finland. But he said he would be “surprised” if Spain’s Balearic Islands - including Ibiza, Majorca and Menorca - were added on Thursday. He told the PA news agency: They’re hugely popular and I’m not sure the government is ready to encourage so much travel at the moment. Portugal is the only viable major tourist destination currently on the green list, but there have been reports it could be downgraded to amber. The government has urged people to avoid non-essential travel to amber and red countries. Travellers returning from amber list locations - which include popular hotspots such as Spain, France, Italy and Greece - must quarantine at home for 10 days and take two post-arrival tests. Several additions to the red list are expected on Thursday. Boyle explained that Bahrain, Costa Rica, Trinidad and Tobago and Kuwait “ought to be on the list” due to “very high infection rates”, whereas Mr Charles warned that Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia and Indonesia could be added as there are “signs of increased infection in many parts of Asia”. People returning to the UK from a red country are required to spend 11 nights in a quarantine hotel, at a cost of 1,750 for solo travellers. Assessments of travel lists are based on a range of factors, including the proportion of a population that has been vaccinated, rates of infection, emerging new variants, and access to reliable scientific data and genomic sequencing. The public should “exercise their common sense” about travelling abroad, a home office minister has said. Asked on Times Radio whether her department would rather people stayed in the UK, Victoria Atkins said: We’re very, very, very supportive of the traffic light system. There are some countries in the world at the moment that because of the variants and the rates of infection are simply too dangerous for us to visit in terms of Covid, and of course they are on the red list. We then have the amber list which we very much ask people not to travel to unless there are very particular, very dire consequences they’re having to deal with, such as a dying relative, and then the green list. And look, the overall goal, we all want to get back to normality, pre-pandemic normality. But I think all understand we’ve got to take careful steps to do that. And so the travel plan and travel lists are very much part of our road map out of lockdown restrictions, but we do have to look at the data. We do have to look at what is happening elsewhere in the world, in order to help advise the public as to what is allowed and what is not allowed. But as with anything, we’re asking the public to exercise their common sense and that is the way that we’re going to be able to return to normality. Senior Tory MP Robert Halfon said the government must “decide their priorities in terms of education” and that the Treasury can “find the money from the back of the sofa”, where there is the political will. The chairman of the education select committee told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: Of course there are funding constraints but the treasury announced over 16 billion extra for defence only last year, we’ve got 800 million being spent on a new research agency, 200 million being spent on a yacht. So where there is the political will, the treasury can find the money from the back of the sofa, and there has to be that political will because we need a long-term plan for education, a proper funding settlement.” He said the damage caused by Covid-19 to younger children “has been nothing short of disastrous”. He added: We need some radical thinking, some thinking out of the box, a proper long-term plan (for education) and I will keep campaigning for that, and a proper funding settlement so that that plan is properly resourced. Home Office minister Victoria Atkins told Sky News the amount allocated by the government to help pupils catch up after the pandemic was “huge”. She said the government was “determined to get (children) back on track” and insisted the 1.4 billion announced on Wednesday for tutoring was “a huge amount of money”. Atkins said the government’s education recovery fund was “very much focused on what we can deliver and deliver quickly”, despite former catch-up tsar Sir Kevan Collins citing in his resignation statement that the package of support is “too narrow, too small and will be delivered too slowly”. She told Sky News the government was “continuing to look at things like lengthening the school day”. She said she had not read the resignation statement issued by Collins. Asked on Sky News whether the government was doing enough for children worst affected by the pandemic, especially in the north and more deprived areas where Collins said impacts would be “particularly severe”, the home office minister said: “Well, I haven’t read his statement. I’m not sure that was quite the point he was making at that point, if I may say so.” She said: But what I’m saying is the point about targeting those children who are most affected by the pandemic is absolutely what this money is about. We want to have a course of tutoring, 15-hour tutoring courses for up to six million of these courses, that’s 100 million tuition hours extra that this money is paying for. And it’s going to be helping those children who are most disadvantaged by this. We’ve got to spend this money wisely, we want it to have the most impact it can possibly have, and that’s why, looking at the evidence that we’ve seen thus far we’re focusing on this one-to-one tuition, to really try to boost children’s chances in the years ahead. Shadow treasury minister James Murray said Labour’s proposals for a catch-up fund would have seen a similar amount of investment as suggested by Sir Kevan Collins. Murray told Sky News: I think what the government has been exposed as having done is not prioritising children’s education, not prioritising the wellbeing of children, and this is the chancellor’s responsibility for not putting the funding forward. He said the funding from the plans should come from “Covid reserves”. If the government does not properly address education needs, a whole generation of children could be failed, an expert has said. Dr Lee Elliot Major, professor of social mobility at the University of Exeter, described departing education tsar Sir Kevan Collins as “one of the most respected” people in the sector and said he would not have taken the decision to step down lightly. Major said “at least 10 times the amounts that were announced yesterday would be needed for children to have a chance of catching up”. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: I just hope that it’s a wake-up call for government to see this as the beginning of a much bigger, more ambitious programme. What we do know, and I think there is a lot of evidence around this, is that extra teaching for children will have huge benefits. And remember this is an investment for the future. If we don’t address these issues now the real fear is that we will fail a whole generation. This is about a whole generation of children and so my belief is that there is compelling evidence that, if done well, if you extend teaching, then that will help us catch up. I don’t see any other way of doing it.","charCount":"10309","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/nicola-slawson\">Nicola Slawson</a>"},{"headline":" Islamophobia inquiry deliberately excluded Muslim Tories, claims ex-MEP","standfirst":"<p>Sajjad Karim urges Boris Johnson not to pursue an ‘English nationalist agenda’ <br></p>","trailText":"Sajjad Karim urges Boris Johnson not to pursue an ‘English nationalist agenda’ <br>","byline":"Aubrey Allegretti Political correspondent","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"80818258f96a584645c401e79d99ab36bda5c8e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/80818258f96a584645c401e79d99ab36bda5c8e6/0_277_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sajjad Karim\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sajjad Karim, who represented north-west England in the European Parliament for 15 years until 2019. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Muslim members of the Conservative party were deliberately excluded from an inquiry into Islamophobia within its ranks, a former Tory MEP has claimed, as he called the complaints procedure “not fit for purpose” and urged Boris Johnson not to pursue an “English nationalist agenda”.</p> <p>Sajjad Karim, who represented north-west England in the European Parliament for 15 years until 2019, said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/may/25/tory-islamophobia-report-criticises-boris-johnson-over-burqa-remarks\">the long-awaited report that came out last week</a> and found no evidence of “institutional Islamophobia” was a “whitewash”, and said apologies from the prime minister for any offence he caused were “insincere”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/audio/2021/jun/02/johnsons-latest-lockdown-dilemma-politics-weekly-podcast\">Johnson’s latest lockdown dilemma: Politics Weekly podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Speaking to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/audio/2021/jun/02/johnsons-latest-lockdown-dilemma-politics-weekly-podcast\">Guardian’s Politics Weekly podcast</a>, Karim voiced concerns that Conservative central headquarters (CCHQ) would use “sleight of hand” to escape implementing the recommendations made by the inquiry’s Prof Swaran Singh.</p> <p>Johnson’s apology “for any offence taken” when he compared women wearing burkas with letterboxes in 2018 and subsequent admission he would not use the same language as prime minister was described as “mealy-mouthed” and “nothing but insulting” by Karim.</p> <p>He said party members – including him – had “no confidence left that the party internally is willing to actually deal with this issue”.</p> <p>“We cannot just rely on internal processes to deliver a result,” Karim said. “That’s why I certainly take the view that it’s time for some sort of external light to be shone upon the internal workings of the Conservative party when it comes to these issues.”</p> <p>Karim revealed he told party officials of a “particular complaint” before the inquiry began and was assured he would be contacted once it was under way, but that he heard “absolutely nothing”.</p> <p>He only found it had closed from media reports, and said he was told by CCHQ “we’re very sorry, it’s too late for you to contribute to the inquiry – it was open to the public but now it’s closed”.</p> <p>This, said Karim, was proof of a “very shabby attempt” to “skewer the findings” of the inquiry by trying to “make sure” only certain people gave evidence so that it progressed “in a certain direction”. “I’m not the only one that finds himself in this position,” he said. “There are many others who simply were excluded from the process.

A year after the coronavirus pandemic emptied airports, air travel associations fear chaos during Europe’s summer holiday season as travellers could wait hours before boarding planes due to health checks.</p> <p>Strict controls are still in place at most European airports even though vaccination campaigns are making progress and infection rates are falling.</p> <p>The International Air Transport Association (IATA) reported last week that on average, people travelling at peak times now stay twice as long at airports - three hours - compared with 2019.</p> <p>That time is generally spent checking in, passing security and immigration controls, picking up checked bags and making it through customs. And there’s the new reality: Airlines having to check passengers’ Covid tests, temperature and other health documents.</p> <p>The wait time has increased even though the volume of traffic is “only about 30 percent of pre-Covid-19 levels”, an IATA statement said.</p> <p>The sector lobby group warned that time spent in airports could swell to five hours and 30 minutes if traffic rebounds to 75 percent of its pre-pandemic level, and even longer “without process improvements”.</p> <p>The EU Digital Covid Certificate - showing whether a traveller was vaccinated, has immunity from a previous infection or passed a coronavirus test - will be rolled out on 1 July in an effort to make travel smoother within the 27-nation bloc.</p> <p>“The level of both uncertainty and complexity in planning for the restart is just mind blowing for now,” said the director general of the European branch of Airports Control International, Olivier Jankovec. His association represents 500 airports on the continent.</p> <p>“With each passing day, the prospect of travellers enduring widespread chaos at airports this summer is becoming more real.”</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-06-03T07:37:36.006Z\">at 8.37am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-60b881cf8f082e80569f4b23\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-03T07:17:07.855Z\">8.17am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Indonesia</strong> has cancelled the haj pilgrimage for people in the world’s largest Muslim-majority nation for a second year in a row due to concerns over the pandemic, the religious affairs minister said this morning.<br></p> <p>Reuters report that minister Yaqut Cholil Qoumas told a briefing that Saudi Arabia, where the pilgrimage takes place, had not opened access to the haj.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60b87f088f08b9889b367642\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-03T07:07:55.130Z\">8.07am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">UK government 'shortchanging children' in England on catch-up plans – Labour spokesperson</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In the UK, Labour’s opposition spokesperson <strong>James Murray</strong> has also been trailing round the TV and radio studios.

And so a lot of us have been talking about a 100-day target from the recognition from a virus with pandemic potential.”<br></p> <p>“It would mean that we would have had a vaccine in early April if that had happened this time, early April of 2020,” Lander said. “It makes you gulp for a second, but it’s totally feasible to do that.”</p> <p>He is the first director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy to be promoted to Cabinet level in a US administration.

In Macon county, <a href=\"https://alpublichealth.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/e4a232feb1344ce0afd9ac162f3ac4ba\">36% of residents have now received their first shot</a> compared with only 32% statewide.

In some areas local political leaders have retreated from public engagement on the issue, while in others, including Tuskegee, local leadership has played a vital role in pushing rates above the state average.</p> <p>Omar Neal, a local radio host and community leader, took his shot almost as soon as it was available. He weighed the heavy history but set aside what he described as instinctive distrust of public health systems after generations of failures.</p> <p>“Trust is a calculated risk,” he said, pausing for a moment. “Five hundred and eighty-eight thousand people have died because they didn’t get this vaccine.

I must say that I was one of those very sceptical about the Wuhan lab leak theory initially, as much of the evidence posted online that I saw seemed to amount to not much more than “They have a lab there, you know”.</p> <p>Former MI6 chief <strong>Sir Richard Dearlove</strong> possibly knows his onions a bit better than me, and he’s had some pretty stringent words about the origins of the virus on a podcast from the Telegraph, and PA have picked up the quotes this morning. He says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The People’s Republic of China is a pretty terrifying regime and does some things we consider unacceptable and extreme in silencing opposition to the official line of the government. We don’t know that’s what’s happened, but a lot of data have probably been destroyed or made to disappear so it’s going to be difficult to prove definitely the case for a ‘gain of function chimera’ being the cause of the pandemic.</p> </blockquote> <p>Trevor Marshallsea writes that Sir Richard said he felt some vindication as more people were beginning to take seriously his repeated questioning of the origins of the coronavirus. He spoke of “extraordinary behaviour” in the scientific community which had “shut down any debate” and which he said verged on “academic bullying”.</p> <p>China, he said, had originally been “let off the hook” on questions about the virus’s origins due to scepticism over the Trump administration, which had led such enquiries initially.</p> <p>He also said the West had been naive in trusting China, which had infiltrated scientific institutions and journals in the UK and elsewhere.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60b86ea28f082ac930ae8b9a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-03T05:55:57.349Z\">6.55am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The latest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2021/jun/03/the-wuhan-lab-leak-theory-podcast\">episode</a> of the Guardian’s Today In Focus podcast is exploring the Wuhan lab leak theory.</p> <p>When Covid-19 first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan, much of the focus of the initial investigation fell on a seafood market that also sold exotic animals for human consumption. But in the months since, no definitive link has been proven and the precise origin story remains unsolved.</p> <p>In the intervening period numerous conspiracy theories have spread: that somehow 5G phone signals could be involved, or that the virus is a hoax. Bracketed in with these was a theory that Covid-19 may have been released (accidentally or otherwise) from a lab.</p> <p>Initially scientists poured scorn on the lab leak theory but in recent months suspicion has fallen on the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which studies coronaviruses. As the Guardian’s <strong>Peter Beaumont </strong>tells <strong>Anushka Asthana</strong>,<strong> </strong>these suspicions are still being treated with scepticism by scientists. But now, in the absence of any other confirmed origin, Joe Biden has asked US intelligence agencies to consider the lab leak theory as a possibility and to investigate.

France will start vaccinating teenagers from age 12 on 15 June Germany plans to offer a first shot to children aged 12-16 from 7 June, while Poland would offer shots to those aged 12-15 the same day. Lithuania’s prime minister said the country could start vaccinating children from age 12 in June. Italy on 31 May approved extending the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to 12-15 year olds. Austria aims to have over 340,000 children aged 12-15 vaccinated by the end of August. Hungary started vaccinating 16-18-year-olds in mid-May. Switzerland’s health watchdog said in early May Pfizer had sought approval for its shot in children aged 12-15. San Marino on 1 June opened vaccinations for children aged 12-15. Infection rates in Germany continue to drop as the country slowly emerges from eight months of lockdown, but politicians are heeding caution over a possible variant-driven resurgence at the end of the summer. The seven-day incidence of infections per 100,000 people over seven days dropped to 34.1 on Thursday, with 4,640 new infections reported by Germany’s disease control agency, the Robert Koch Institute. Social Democrat delegate Karl Lauterbach, a trained doctor and prominent health expert, said he expected the incidence rate to remain around 35 in the coming weeks, as people spent more time outdoors during the summer and more and more people were fully immunised. Some 53 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines have been administered in Germany so far, and 44.6% of the population has had at least one shot. Lauterbach said he expected the “Delta variant” of the virus that was first detected in India to become more dominant in Germany after the holidays, saying it “will probably spread around numerous European countries in the coming months”. For now, the Delta variant B1.617.2 only plays a minor role in Germany, making up 2.1 percent of cases reported over the last week. Nonetheless Germany is one of the European countries who have imposed restrictions on travel from the United Kingdom over the variant, with anyone entering Germany from the UK will be required quarantine for two weeks on arrival, even if they test negative for the coronavirus. Regular readers of this blog will know that I usually slightly raise one eyebrow when reporting the official numbers out of Russia as they are remarkably consistent. They’ve pretty much been in the range of 7,000 to 9,500 daily every day since early March, which feels unusual as it suggest the virus is neither gathering pace or diminishing, which tends not to be how epidemics behave. Today is no different, as Russia reported 8,933 new cases taking the official national tally since the pandemic began to 5,099,182. The government coronavirus task force said 393 people had died of coronavirus linked causes in the past 24 hours, pushing the national death toll to 122,660. Reuters always note that the federal statistics agency has kept a separate count and has said Russia recorded significantly more fatalities than that. They put the figure at around 250,000 deaths related to Covid from April 2020 to March 2021. My colleague Nicola Slawson has just opened up the UK live blog for the day – so if you are looking for UK Covid news, that’s where you need to head. I’ll be continuing here with global updates. Bulgaria plans to provide about 150,000 Covid vaccines to its Balkan neighbours, health minister Stoicho Katsarov has said. Bulgaria has the lowest inoculation rates in the European Union, but Katsarov said the country has agreed to receive about 13m doses under the EU supply scheme by the end of the year and can afford to help other countries. “The idea is to distribute up to 150,000 doses among our neighbouring western Balkan countries,” Katsarov told reporters, adding that Sofia has received requests from North Macedonia, Albania, Kosovo and Bosnia. “Our needs are fully covered so there is no danger whatsoever that Bulgaria can be left without vaccines,” he said. Reuters report Katsarov said he expects to receive an answer on Friday from the European Commission how exactly the country should proceed and whether it could donate or sell the doses. He said Bulgaria was looking to donate mostly AstraZeneca vaccines, not least because of the low interest in them at home. Last week president Rumen Radev said Sofia plans to donate a significant amount of vaccines to North Macedonia in a move that could help improve strained relations over Bulgaria’s veto on the start of EU accession talks with Skopje. A quick one from Sky here, that the reopening of indoor hospitality last month failed to boost footfall in town centres in England. The figures are compiled by a company called Springboard, and they said: May was the wettest on record which inevitably lowered the initial exhilaration of consumers in being able to eat out as even visiting indoor environments necessitated braving the weather. Secondly, the limitations on dining capacity in indoor venues inevitably means that the uplift in footfall generated has been limited; and thirdly most of the increase in footfall has occurred post 5pm when volumes of activity are far lower those than during retail trading hours. Footfall in May 2021 was around 25% down on the same pre-pandemic period in 2019 Hong Kong will open its vaccine scheme to children over the age of 12 for the first time, Reuters report, as it pursues a broader campaign across the city to incentivise its 7.5 million residents to get vaccinated. The region started its vaccination programme in February but only around 14% of the population have been fully vaccinated so far. Another 17 people have died in Taiwan, where authorities reported 364 new local cases and 219 backlogged cases added to previous days’ totals. It brings Taiwan’s total death toll to 166, of which 154 have been since 15 May. Taiwan’s worst outbreak since the pandemic began continues to report high daily numbers, but analyses of the general trend are tentatively suggesting a decline. Finding trends in the data has been made difficult during this outbreak, as a backlog of cases routinely adds dozens of cases to previous days. In its daily briefing today, the central epidemic command centre reported details of a growing outbreak in aged care, and a cluster among migrant workers in Miaoli county. Ahead of an upcoming long weekend, health and welfare minister Chen Chih-Shung urged people not to travel. Taiwan is on level 3 of a four tier alert system which does not stop people from traveling. Restrictions limit gatherings to 10 outside and five inside, restaurants are take-away only, and employers have been urged to facilitate working from home, although this has not been widely taken up. Another quick Reuters snap here, that Syria has received the first shipment of Russian Sputnik V vaccine. Syrian President Bashar Assad was inoculated with the vaccine, Syrian ambassador to Russia Riad Haddad said. Also on variants, Reuters report that a coronavirus variant which Vietnam authorities thought was a combination of the Indian and UK strains is not a new hybrid but part of the existing Indian strain, the World Health Organization’s representative in Vietnam told Nikkei. “There is no new hybrid variant in Vietnam at this moment based on WHO definition,” Kidong Park said in an online interview with the newspaper, adding that it was within the “Delta variation” that was first detected in India. In the UK today the Daily Mail is carrying a front page story warning of the threat from what they call a “Nepal variant”. The World Health Organization in Nepal have put out a tweet this morning saying that they aren’t aware of any such variant. One of things we are expecting today is for the UK government to announce if they are making any changes to the green, amber and red lists for international travel. A lot of people with hopes of a holiday or visiting loved ones abroad will have their eye closely on the situation – we might get that news around 11am this morning. Getting there may prove more of a headache than usual, as AFP report. A year after the coronavirus pandemic emptied airports, air travel associations fear chaos during Europe’s summer holiday season as travellers could wait hours before boarding planes due to health checks. Strict controls are still in place at most European airports even though vaccination campaigns are making progress and infection rates are falling. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) reported last week that on average, people travelling at peak times now stay twice as long at airports - three hours - compared with 2019. That time is generally spent checking in, passing security and immigration controls, picking up checked bags and making it through customs. And there’s the new reality: Airlines having to check passengers’ Covid tests, temperature and other health documents. The wait time has increased even though the volume of traffic is “only about 30 percent of pre-Covid-19 levels”, an IATA statement said. The sector lobby group warned that time spent in airports could swell to five hours and 30 minutes if traffic rebounds to 75 percent of its pre-pandemic level, and even longer “without process improvements”. The EU Digital Covid Certificate - showing whether a traveller was vaccinated, has immunity from a previous infection or passed a coronavirus test - will be rolled out on 1 July in an effort to make travel smoother within the 27-nation bloc. “The level of both uncertainty and complexity in planning for the restart is just mind blowing for now,” said the director general of the European branch of Airports Control International, Olivier Jankovec. His association represents 500 airports on the continent. “With each passing day, the prospect of travellers enduring widespread chaos at airports this summer is becoming more real.” Indonesia has cancelled the haj pilgrimage for people in the world’s largest Muslim-majority nation for a second year in a row due to concerns over the pandemic, the religious affairs minister said this morning. Reuters report that minister Yaqut Cholil Qoumas told a briefing that Saudi Arabia, where the pilgrimage takes place, had not opened access to the haj. In the UK, Labour’s opposition spokesperson James Murray has also been trailing round the TV and radio studios. On the proposals for catch-up funding for pupils in England, he told Sky News: I think everyone listening to the show will realise that what the government is doing by shortchanging children feels wrong, and it’s also the ultimate false economy. If we don’t invest in protecting our children now, and making sure that their education catches up, that they are prepared in terms of their mental wellbeing and so on, it’s going to cost the country and the economy dearly in the long run. Seth Borenstein, science writer at AP, reports that in the US, new White House science adviser Eric Lander wants to have a vaccine ready to fight the next pandemic in just about 100 days after recognizing a potential viral outbreak. In his first interview after being sworn in, he painted a rosy near future where a renewed American emphasis on science not only better prepares the world for the next pandemic with plug-and-play vaccines, but also changes how medicine fights disease and treats patients, curbs climate change and further explores space. “This is a moment in so many ways, not just health, that we can rethink fundamental assumptions about what’s possible and that’s true of climate and energy and many areas,” Lander told The Associated Press. “It was amazing at one level that we were able to produce highly effective vaccines in less than a year, but from another point of view you’d say, ‘Boy, a year’s a long time,”’ even though in the past it would take three years or four years, Lander said. “To really make a difference we want to get this done in 100 days. And so a lot of us have been talking about a 100-day target from the recognition from a virus with pandemic potential.” “It would mean that we would have had a vaccine in early April if that had happened this time, early April of 2020,” Lander said. “It makes you gulp for a second, but it’s totally feasible to do that.” He is the first director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy to be promoted to Cabinet level in a US administration. Lander said President Joe Biden’s elevation of the science post is a symbolic show “that science should have a seat at the table” but also allows him to have higher-level talks with different agency chiefs about making policy. A very quick Reuters snap here that the Serum Institute of India has sought regulatory approval to make Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine, on top of the AstraZeneca and Novavax shots it is already producing. In England, much of the news this morning has been dominated by the continued fall-out over the government’s plans for education “catch-up” spending. Yesterday Sir Kevan Collins quit, said to be dismayed that his long-awaited £15bn proposals were watered down to a £1.4bn package. Home Office minister Victoria Atkins has been out and about fronting up the government response, saying that the Government’s education recovery fund was “very much focused on what we can deliver and deliver quickly” Collins said in his resignation statement that the package of support is “too narrow, too small and will be delivered too slowly”. When asked on Sky News, Atkins said she had not read the resignation statement – which does seem somewhat extraordinary given that she’s been sent out this morning specifically to rebut it She told Sky News the Government was “continuing to look at things like lengthening the school day”. Meanwhile, PA report that senior Conservative MP Robert Halfon said the Government must “decide their priorities in terms of education” and that the Treasury can “find the money from the back of the sofa”, where there is the political will. The chairman of the Education Select Committee told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “Of course there are funding constraints but the Treasury announced over £16bn extra for defence only last year, we’ve got £800m being spent on a new research agency, £200m being spent on a yacht. “So where there is the political will, the Treasury can find the money from the back of the sofa, and there has to be that political will because we need a long-term plan for education, a proper funding settlement.” He said the damage caused by Covid-19 to younger children “has been nothing short of disastrous”. Oliver Laughland brings us a special report on vaccine hesitancy this morning from Tuskegee and Florala in the US: In 1997, President Bill Clinton apologized for the Tuskegee study, which he described as “clearly racist”. Two decades on, the legacy of what happened here has been routinely cited as a reason many Black Americans remain distrustful of the country’s medical systems and also the Covid-19 vaccine itself. It is then, perhaps, against expectation that vaccination rates in Macon county, where this city of 8,000 residents is situated, are substantially higher than the state average in Alabama. In Macon county, 36% of residents have now received their first shot compared with only 32% statewide. In this historic region of Black Belt counties, home to large populations of Black residents, some jurisdictions have completed vaccinations at rates of over 40%. But Alabama and the neighbouring state of Mississippi have for months had the lowest vaccination rates in the country, with vaccine hesitancy underwritten by different forces in various locations across the state. In some areas local political leaders have retreated from public engagement on the issue, while in others, including Tuskegee, local leadership has played a vital role in pushing rates above the state average. Omar Neal, a local radio host and community leader, took his shot almost as soon as it was available. He weighed the heavy history but set aside what he described as instinctive distrust of public health systems after generations of failures. “Trust is a calculated risk,” he said, pausing for a moment. “Five hundred and eighty-eight thousand people have died because they didn’t get this vaccine. Nobody died that did take it. That’s pretty good odds for me.” Read more of Oliver Laughland’s report here: Alabama faces vaccine hesitancy but only some counties try to tackle it A five-pronged approach focused on the five C’s - confidence, complacency, convenience, communication and context - is needed to combat vaccine hesitancy, according to scientists from the UK, US and South Africa. PA report that writing in the Royal Society of Medicine journal, they say complacency due to lower perceptions of personal risk and disease severity, particularly among younger people and those of lower socioeconomic status, is strongly associated with lower vaccine uptake. One of the authors, Dr Mohammad Razai, of the Population Health Research Institute at St George’s, University of London, said: “As the lower age groups are being offered the vaccine, addressing complacency through repeated risk communication is crucial to facilitate informed decision-making. “It is important to emphasise the greater societal benefits of population level immunity and the protection it offers to those vulnerable, their families and friends.” The proposed strategy also focuses on convenience of vaccination delivery, communication to combat misinformation, and recognition of context including ethnicity, religion, occupation and socioeconomic status. Confidence in vaccine safety, efficacy and importance is crucial, and the public needs to be aware that for most people the benefits of vaccine “vastly outweigh the risk” of rare side effects, they write. Getting Alan Sugar to endorse the vaccine for young people was probably not on their list of priorities, but he’s done that on social media this morning in his own imitable style. Workers in Melbourne in Australia who haven’t had shifts due to the extended Covid lockdown will be eligible for up to $500 in support after the prime minister announced a new temporary Covid disaster payment. Scott Morrison said on Thursday the disaster payment would be available in areas declared a commonwealth hotspot when any lockdown lasted longer than seven days. A $500 weekly payment will be available for people who work more than 20 hours a week while $325 will be available for those who work less than that. The support will only go to people older than 17, who were working before the lockdown and who can no longer work. They will need to have less than $10,000 in savings. There are further restrictions including whether other leave – beyond annual and sick leave – is available to cover the lockdown period. Good morning, it is Martin Belam here in London taking over for the next few hours. I must say that I was one of those very sceptical about the Wuhan lab leak theory initially, as much of the evidence posted online that I saw seemed to amount to not much more than “They have a lab there, you know”. Former MI6 chief Sir Richard Dearlove possibly knows his onions a bit better than me, and he’s had some pretty stringent words about the origins of the virus on a podcast from the Telegraph, and PA have picked up the quotes this morning. He says: The People’s Republic of China is a pretty terrifying regime and does some things we consider unacceptable and extreme in silencing opposition to the official line of the government. We don’t know that’s what’s happened, but a lot of data have probably been destroyed or made to disappear so it’s going to be difficult to prove definitely the case for a ‘gain of function chimera’ being the cause of the pandemic. Trevor Marshallsea writes that Sir Richard said he felt some vindication as more people were beginning to take seriously his repeated questioning of the origins of the coronavirus. He spoke of “extraordinary behaviour” in the scientific community which had “shut down any debate” and which he said verged on “academic bullying”. China, he said, had originally been “let off the hook” on questions about the virus’s origins due to scepticism over the Trump administration, which had led such enquiries initially. He also said the West had been naive in trusting China, which had infiltrated scientific institutions and journals in the UK and elsewhere. The latest episode of the Guardian’s Today In Focus podcast is exploring the Wuhan lab leak theory. When Covid-19 first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan, much of the focus of the initial investigation fell on a seafood market that also sold exotic animals for human consumption. But in the months since, no definitive link has been proven and the precise origin story remains unsolved. In the intervening period numerous conspiracy theories have spread: that somehow 5G phone signals could be involved, or that the virus is a hoax. Bracketed in with these was a theory that Covid-19 may have been released (accidentally or otherwise) from a lab. Initially scientists poured scorn on the lab leak theory but in recent months suspicion has fallen on the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which studies coronaviruses. As the Guardian’s Peter Beaumont tells Anushka Asthana, these suspicions are still being treated with scepticism by scientists. But now, in the absence of any other confirmed origin, Joe Biden has asked US intelligence agencies to consider the lab leak theory as a possibility and to investigate. So how seriously should we take it? In Australia, Melbourne GPs say they are being forced to turn away huge numbers of vaccine-seeking locals, including busloads of vulnerable residents from care facilities, because the commonwealth’s supply of doses has not increased to match the explosion in demand. The latest outbreak has caused a huge increase in demand for the Covid-19 vaccine in Victoria, and the state is now recording daily vaccination numbers of above 20,000 in primary care, up from the roughly 2,300 doses administered on 24 May. The demand has inundated local GPs, who say their supplies of vaccine doses are evaporating almost immediately. Seiko Hashimoto, the president of the Tokyo 2020 organising committee has ruled out a cancellation or further postponement of the Olympics, amid concerns about hosting the event during a global pandemic. “We cannot postpone again,” she said in an interview with Nikkan Sports newspaper. Reuters reports: Public opinion polls in Japan have consistently shown that a majority want the Games cancelled or put off yet again after being delayed by one year because of the coronavirus crisis. A majority of the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly feel the same way, the Tokyo Shimbun newspaper reported on Thursday. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga is likely to call a snap election after the Olympic and Paralympic Games, the Asahi newspaper reported, showing his resolve to push ahead with the event. Towns and cities lined up to host Olympic training or events have increasingly expressed resistance, amid concern visitors will spread variant strains of the virus and drain medical resources. The government of Ota City has been inundated with complaints by residents over a decision to give preferential Covid-19 vaccinations to city and hotel staff tending to Australian athletes, media reported. While Japan has avoided the large-scale infections suffered by many other nations, severe cases are rising in the latest outbreak. More than 746,000 cases have been recorded and more than 13,000 deaths. Shigeru Omi, Japan’s top medical adviser, told a parliamentary committee on Wednesday that it was “not normal” to host the Olympics amid the current state of infections. Reuters: Pot-banging protests erupted across several cities in Brazil last night, as President Jair Bolsonaro addressed the nation, Reuters reports. It occurred just days after protestors took to the streets across the country over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which has so far killed almost half a million people. The last few days have been rocky for the government of the right-wing leader, whose popularity had already been flagging amid persistently high daily Covid-19 deaths and cases. On Wednesday alone, almost 100,000 Brazilians came down with the coronavirus and 2,507 died, according to government data. Earlier in the day, the nation’s Supreme Court authorised a criminal investigation into Bolsonaro’s environment minister for allegedly interfering with a police probe into illegal logging. In the televised speech, Bolsonaro briefly summarised some of his government’s recent accomplishments and pledged strong economic growth going forward, but presented no new information. On Saturday, thousands participated in protests in at least 16 cities across the country, which were organised by leftist political parties, unions and student associations. In Sao Paulo, Brazil’s largest city, thousands of mask-wearing people blocked one the largest city’s avenues, while a large balloon depicted Bolsonaro as a vampire. Some protests, like the one in Rio de Janeiro, included images of former leftist president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who has emerged as Bolsonaro’s main challenger in the nation’s 2022 election, wearing the presidential sash. In the brief Wednesday evening speech, Bolsonaro, who has ridiculed masks and vaccines in the past, said all Brazilians who wanted a vaccine would be able to get one by the end of the year. Also in the evening, the nation’s Health Ministry revised down the number of Covid-19 vaccines it will receive in June by about 4 million doses. Hello and welcome to our continuing coverage of the global pandemic. Here is a short update of developments in the last 24 hours In the US Joe Biden has announced a “national month of action” to get 70% of Americans vaccinated. Meanwhile in Australia, doctors in Melbourne say they have had to turn away patients because they don’t have enough vaccines to meet demand. The pandemic has pushed more than 100 million more workers into poverty, the UN has said. Cancellation or another postponement of the Tokyo Olympic Games has been ruled out by the head of the organising committee. France will start vaccinating teenagers from age 12 with the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine on June 15, the government said. Mexico reported 3,269 new cases of Covid-19 in the country and 306 more fatalities, Reuters reports. It brings the total to 2,423,928 infections and 228,146 deaths, according to health ministry data released on Wednesday. Spanish regions with a low Covid infection rate will be allowed to reopen nightlife before herd immunity is achieved, which is expected by mid-August, the health minister said. The Canadian province of Ontario will keep schools closed for in-person learning until the new school year starts in September, premier Doug Ford announced. Germany plans to pay vaccine manufacturers an annual reservation fee to build up reserve capacity of around 600-700m doses per year to help it fight future pandemics, the health minister said. Colombia has began what its government called a gradual opening of its border with Venezuela after a 14-month closure intended to curb the spread of the coronavirus. In Germany, the Robert Koch Institute has confirmed that a third wave of the virus has been broken. EU governments have agreed to add Japan to their small list of countries from which they will allow non-essential travel, it was reported earlier.","charCount":"27639","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a> (now) and <a href=\"profile/helen-davidson\">Helen Davidson</a> (earlier)"},{"headline":"Flying cars?

The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has warned that countries need to be net zero (also known as carbon neutral) by 2050 in order to have any chance of limiting global warming to 1.5C. Beyond that, the planet will most likely pass irreversible and catastrophic tipping points. To do this, we must decarbonise. But how? What changes do we need to make as individuals and as a society, and how will this process impact our lives? Here are five things you need to know …</p> <p><strong>Measurement is key<br></strong>In order to reduce something, we first need to measure it. On an individual level, we can estimate our own carbon footprints (ie the environmental impact of our activities and lifestyle) by using a carbon calculator such as the <a href=\"https://footprint.wwf.org.uk/#/\" rel=\"nofollow\">WWF’s carbon footprint calculator</a>. Meanwhile, having a smart meter installed in your home is a tangible way to quantify your energy use and can help you to do your bit to reduce your carbon footprint. </p> <p>Seeing what energy you’re using can help you to be more energy efficient and speed up the process of decarbonising and upgrading our energy system. Renewable energies such as solar, wind and wave power are vital to our greener future, but we’ll need to be able to store this energy for when the turbines aren’t turning or the sun isn’t shining. For this to work, we need a more intelligent, flexible grid – which is where smart meters come in, as they’ll provide the grid with the data it needs to enable supply to be more finely tuned to demand.</p> <p><strong>Carbon offsetting isn’t the answer<br></strong>To achieve net zero, we need to substantially cut carbon emissions – not just buy carbon credits that shunt the problem elsewhere. Carbon offsetting schemes are controversial, and really should be a last resort rather than a green light to continue emitting greenhouse gases. Why?

The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has warned that countries need to be net zero (also known as carbon neutral) by 2050 in order to have any chance of limiting global warming to 1.5C. Beyond that, the planet will most likely pass irreversible and catastrophic tipping points. To do this, we must decarbonise. But how? What changes do we need to make as individuals and as a society, and how will this process impact our lives? Here are five things you need to know … Measurement is key In order to reduce something, we first need to measure it. On an individual level, we can estimate our own carbon footprints (ie the environmental impact of our activities and lifestyle) by using a carbon calculator such as the WWF’s carbon footprint calculator. Meanwhile, having a smart meter installed in your home is a tangible way to quantify your energy use and can help you to do your bit to reduce your carbon footprint. Seeing what energy you’re using can help you to be more energy efficient and speed up the process of decarbonising and upgrading our energy system. Renewable energies such as solar, wind and wave power are vital to our greener future, but we’ll need to be able to store this energy for when the turbines aren’t turning or the sun isn’t shining. For this to work, we need a more intelligent, flexible grid – which is where smart meters come in, as they’ll provide the grid with the data it needs to enable supply to be more finely tuned to demand. Carbon offsetting isn’t the answer To achieve net zero, we need to substantially cut carbon emissions – not just buy carbon credits that shunt the problem elsewhere. Carbon offsetting schemes are controversial, and really should be a last resort rather than a green light to continue emitting greenhouse gases. Why? Well not only do trees take decades to mature, but planting huge monocultures of seedlings in far-flung places uses a lot of land and can’t support as much wildlife as diverse, established forests. What’s more, plankton in the ocean produce half the oxygen we breathe, converting carbon dioxide in the process. Seaweed, eelgrass beds and the deep seabed store carbon, too. So protecting existing ancient woodland, peat bogs and ocean habitats will help keep our planet healthy by storing or “sequestering” carbon. Basically, we need to protect our wildlife, stay responsible for our own carbon footprints and make no excuses. Carbon capture and storage could be part of the solution Carbon capture and storage (CSS) works by taking carbon dioxide from industrial facilities where concentrations are high and solidifying it into rock that can be stored underground. Although controversial, schemes such as the one being trialled at the Drax power station in North Yorkshire – where the aim is to capture one tonne of CO2 from its wood combustion every day – could help prevent the release of large quantities of CO2 into the atmosphere.

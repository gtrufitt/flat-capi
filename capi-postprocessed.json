Most rural communities depend directly on their land and forests for at least some of their needs. When that forest vanishes, or is stolen, the impacts are severe.”</p> <p>While China’s new forest law, which came into effect in July 2020, aims to promote sustainable trade of timber, as well as to safeguard China’s forests, there are still concerns about some companies’ practices.</p> <p> “Even if the laws and rules change, it will take time and effective enforcement before the companies change behaviour,” Stanley says.</p> <h2>Foreign-flagged fishing vessels</h2> <p>Fishing is a huge source of income for many small Pacific nations. But they largely haven’t been able to capture the full value of this resource. Apart from Fiji, Pacific nations haven’t been able to move up the value chain into the processing of fish into more valuable products.</p> <p>Kiribati, for instance, <a href=\"https://www.spc.int/sites/default/files/wordpresscontent/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Gillett_16_Benefish-fisheries-in-economies-of-pacific-countries.pdf\">receives</a> up to 75% of its government revenue from fishing access fees and levies. But Kiribati directly exports very little – just 1,000 tonnes of seafood were exported to China in 2019. Foreign-flagged vessels, meanwhile, landed hundreds of thousands of tonnes of fish in Kiribati waters.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"102c305849a629905a914221adbdb1cd7a5ddb10\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/102c305849a629905a914221adbdb1cd7a5ddb10/0_0_5404_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chinese fishing boat detained by Palauan authorities on suspicion of illegally harvesting sea cucumber.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chinese fishing boat detained by Palauan authorities on suspicion of illegally harvesting sea cucumber.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Brooks/Lightning Strike Media Productions</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A survey of boats operating in the Pacific in 2016 found that Chinese-flagged vessels far outstripped those of any other country.

Rather, local fishing is concentrated in coastal waters. There are highly valuable species in these waters, according to Dr Hugh Govan at the University of the South Pacific, such as sea cucumbers. But Govan says many coastal fisheries are overfished or commercially extinct.</p> <p>The main market for sea cucumbers is southern China, but these were overfished to such a degree in PNG that the government <a href=\"https://www.uts.edu.au/about/faculty-arts-and-social-sciences/research/fass-research-projects/social-science-fisheries/png-beche-de-mer-fish-chain\">had to halt fishing for several years</a>.</p> <p>China’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Hua Chunying, says China is “<a href=\"https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/xwfw_665399/s2510_665401/t1837636.shtml\">a responsible fishing country</a>”, with “‘zero tolerance’ for violations of relevant laws and regulations committed by distant fishing vessels”.</p> <p>“We have … strengthened international cooperation, and done a great deal of fruitful work in jointly combating illegal fishing and promoting the sustainable development of fishery resources with other countries.”</p> <h2>Mining disasters and scrutiny</h2> <p>Measured by weight, Solomon Islands sends almost all of its mineral products to China, much of it aluminium ore.</p> <p>Minerals account for more than <a href=\"https://eiti.org/files/documents/2018-png-eiti-report.pdf\">90% of the value of PNG’s total exports</a>, and it sends just over 30% by weight to China.

Guardian analysis of trade data has revealed that China received more than half the total tonnes of seafood, wood and minerals exported from the region in 2019, a haul worth $3.3bn that has been described by experts as “staggering in magnitude”. The country’s mass extraction of resources comes as China has deepened its connections with governments across the region, amid a soft power push that sees it rivalling the influence of the US and Australia in the Pacific. China took more by weight of these resources from the Pacific than the next 10 countries combined, with experts saying China “would easily outstrip” other countries, including Australia, when it comes to “gross environmental impact of its extractive industries”. Data analysis reveals the extent of China’s appetite for Pacific natural resources. In 2019 China imported 4.8m tonnes of wood, 4.8m tonnes of mineral products, and 72,000 tonnes of seafood from the Pacific. The next single largest customer for the Pacific’s extractive resources was Japan, which imported 4.1m tonnes of minerals – mostly petroleum - 370,000 tonnes of wood and 24,000 tonnes of seafood. Australia imported 600,000 tonnes of minerals, 5,000 tonnes of wood and 200 tonnes of seafood. Shane Macleod, a research fellow at the Lowy Institute, says that China is such a dominant customer of Pacific resources because of its proximity to the region and its need to power its economy. “They just have the appetite. They have the need for natural resources and they’re looking for sources and the Pacific is geographically close. It has the added benefit that the supply lines are shorter,” he said. “So you can look at the Ramu nickel mine in Papua New Guinea. That is providing raw material for China in the region, directly, without having to be transported from the other side of the planet.” From Solomon Islands, more than 90% of extractive resources go to China when measured by weight. And China regularly claims more than 90% of the total tonnes of wood exported by Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands. Beyond direct imports of resources, data from the American Enterprise Institute shows more than US$2bn was invested by Chinese companies in Pacific mining in the past two decades. These include investments in the controversial Porgera, Ramu Nickel and Frieda River mines in PNG. The Chinese government has also sent billions of dollars in official finance into the region, including tens of millions for new marine and industrial zones. Comparing the Pacific’s exports China is the Pacific’s biggest customer whether measured by weight or US dollars. But Australia is close behind when measured in value – $2.8bn to China’s $3.3bn in 2019. This is due to the fact that many extractive products are heavy but relatively inexpensive commodities, like wood. “In terms of the gross environmental impact of its extractive industries, China would easily outstrip other industrial nations that operate in the Pacific region, including Australia,” says Prof Bill Laurance from James Cook University in north Queensland. “China’s mineral, timber, fossil fuel, food and other imports from Pacific Island nations are staggering in magnitude. They’re creating enormous challenges for sustainable development in the region.” ‘High-risk timber producers’ Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Tonga and Palau all regularly send more than 90% of their wood exports to China. China’s size doesn’t neatly explain this concentration, as it takes less than 10% of the wood exported by Malaysia, a much larger producer. Malaysian companies also dominate logging in PNG and Solomon Islands. According to some estimates, illegal timber makes up as much as 70% of logs exported from Solomon Islands. As a very large and nearby country, China is a natural customer for the Pacific’s exports. But experts say the outsized take also has to do with China’s lack of laws against importing illegal timber, and poor accountability for environmental or social impacts. “Both [Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands] suffer from entrenched endemic corruption that has made it (so far) impossible to hold to account both the logging industry and the politicians profiting from them,” says Lela Stanley, a policy adviser at the NGO Global Witness. “They are known high-risk timber producers, and countries with more stringent laws on illegal timber should avoid them accordingly. Currently China has no law explicitly forbidding the import of illegally produced timber.” The logging that takes place in the region has huge impacts on communities. “Most of those logs have been produced illegally, often … through the violation of land rights. This is not an abstract concept in PNG but one with real-life impacts for countless people across the country. Most rural communities depend directly on their land and forests for at least some of their needs. When that forest vanishes, or is stolen, the impacts are severe.” While China’s new forest law, which came into effect in July 2020, aims to promote sustainable trade of timber, as well as to safeguard China’s forests, there are still concerns about some companies’ practices. “Even if the laws and rules change, it will take time and effective enforcement before the companies change behaviour,” Stanley says. Foreign-flagged fishing vessels Fishing is a huge source of income for many small Pacific nations. But they largely haven’t been able to capture the full value of this resource. Apart from Fiji, Pacific nations haven’t been able to move up the value chain into the processing of fish into more valuable products. Kiribati, for instance, receives up to 75% of its government revenue from fishing access fees and levies. But Kiribati directly exports very little – just 1,000 tonnes of seafood were exported to China in 2019. Foreign-flagged vessels, meanwhile, landed hundreds of thousands of tonnes of fish in Kiribati waters. A survey of boats operating in the Pacific in 2016 found that Chinese-flagged vessels far outstripped those of any other country. China had 290 industrial vessels licensed to operate in the region at the time, more than a quarter of the total, and more than the 240 from all the Pacific nations combined. Outside of PNG, little of the offshore fishing in the Pacific is conducted by locally flagged ships. Rather, local fishing is concentrated in coastal waters. There are highly valuable species in these waters, according to Dr Hugh Govan at the University of the South Pacific, such as sea cucumbers. But Govan says many coastal fisheries are overfished or commercially extinct. The main market for sea cucumbers is southern China, but these were overfished to such a degree in PNG that the government had to halt fishing for several years. China’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Hua Chunying, says China is “a responsible fishing country”, with “‘zero tolerance’ for violations of relevant laws and regulations committed by distant fishing vessels”. “We have … strengthened international cooperation, and done a great deal of fruitful work in jointly combating illegal fishing and promoting the sustainable development of fishery resources with other countries.” Mining disasters and scrutiny Measured by weight, Solomon Islands sends almost all of its mineral products to China, much of it aluminium ore. Minerals account for more than 90% of the value of PNG’s total exports, and it sends just over 30% by weight to China. Australia is also deeply involved in mining in PNG – controlling many of the largest mines, and importing $2.5bn of gold in 2019. Australia takes almost 100% of the gold from Fiji and about 80% from PNG. But when measured in weight these pale compared with the minerals exported to China. But the Lowy Institute’s Shane McLeod, argues that a significant difference between Chinese and Australian trading partners is how accountable companies are held for environmental and social issues. Large-scale mining operations in PNG have a horrific environmental track record, including disposal of mining waste at Anglo-Australian BHP’s Ok Tedi mine, at Anglo-Australian Rio Tinto’s Panguna and, more recently, at the Chinese-operated Ramu Nickel mine. Many foreign-owned companies have subsequently withdrawn from projects that have proven environmentally ruinous. “But Chinese companies operating abroad aren’t subjected to scrutiny from their home markets in the same way as companies from western nations are,” McLeod said. “Ok Tedi is a good example – the environmental disaster was a cause of major embarrassment for [BHP], with scrutiny from media eventually fed through to investors.” “Companies with a Chinese listing/investors do face pressure and scrutiny, but I think the way that manifests itself is opaque and unseen. It’s not clear to what extent an environmental issue would limit the operations of a resource project, for example. “I expect feedback for MCC [the Metallurgical Corporation of China, the operator of Ramu Nickel] comes through a political/governmental channel rather than, say, a journalist from China covering the environmental impact of a mine there.” China’s foreign ministry did not reply to the Guardian’s requests for comment. Last year the PNG government cancelled the mining lease of the part-Chinese owned Porgera mine, claiming that the country was not getting its fair share of major natural resource projects. The Chinese joint venture partner, Zijin Mining, “has flagged international political ramifications, warning the lease dispute could damage bilateral relations between [PNG] and China”. The next test of corporate social responsibility may be on the horizon, with proposed mines from both Australian and Chinese companies in PNG facing pushback for environmental and cultural reasons. Notes and methods Guardian Australia’s trade flow dataset was constructed using the 2019 version of the BACI database created by CEPII. The BACI database was in turn created using UN Comtrade data, directly reported by each country. Goods in the BACI database were identified using the HS17 version of the Harmonized System Codes. The Guardian classified goods as “seafood products”, “wood products” or “oil, metal and mineral products” based on keywords in the Harmonised System Codes. Aggregate trade flows were calculated by grouping data by exporter, importer and the category assigned by the Guardian.","charCount":"10438","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/josh-nicholas\">Josh Nicholas</a>"},{"headline":"Pacific Plunder: this is who profits from the mass extraction of the region’s natural resources – interactive","standfirst":"<p>Across the region, mining, logging and fishing have formed the basis of economies and development, but have sometimes come at catastrophic cost</p><ul><li>Read more of our Pacific Plunder series <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/pacific-plunder\">here</a></li></ul>","trailText":"Across the region, mining, logging and fishing have formed the basis of economies and development, but have sometimes come at catastrophic cost","byline":"Josh Nicholas, Andy Ball, Nick Evershed, Ben Doherty and Kate Lyons","main":"","body":"<figure class=\"element element-atom element--immersive\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2021/02/plundering-the-pacific-maps/main\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>","wordcount":"0","displayHint":"immersive","firstPublicationDate":"2021-05-30T20:00:03Z","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2021-05-30T20:01:22Z","productionOffice":"AUS","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/p/gn4ny","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4c0acd70264add082cca1e18b08a1502edb49e0/0_142_4000_2400/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","isLive":"true","bodyText":"","charCount":"0","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/josh-nicholas\">Josh Nicholas</a>, <a href=\"profile/andy-ball\">Andy Ball</a>, <a href=\"profile/nick-evershed\">Nick Evershed</a>, <a href=\"profile/ben-doherty\">Ben Doherty</a> and <a href=\"profile/kate-lyons\">Kate Lyons</a>"},{"headline":"Covid live news: Italy records lowest deaths since mid-October; UK could make vaccines mandatory for NHS staff","standfirst":"<p>Latest updates: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2021/may/30/covid-live-news-uk-lockdown-ending-date-keir-starmer-boris-johnson-australia-new-zealand-india-variant-coronavirus?page=with:block-60b3c3ae8f088d8c3178dd25#block-60b3c3ae8f088d8c3178dd25\">Italy reports 44 Covid-related deaths</a>; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2021/may/30/covid-live-news-uk-lockdown-ending-date-keir-starmer-boris-johnson-australia-new-zealand-india-variant-coronavirus?page=with:block-60b34a0e8f08d486a771760b#block-60b34a0e8f08d486a771760b\">UK government considering mandatory jabs for health workers</a></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2021/may/30/covid-live-news-uk-lockdown-ending-date-keir-starmer-boris-johnson-australia-new-zealand-india-variant-coronavirus?page=with:block-60b342668f086d71cc15efd6#block-60b342668f086d71cc15efd6\">Malaysia to set up more mega vaccination centres</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/may/29/keir-starmer-boris-johnsons-chaos-could-hit-june-plan-to-lift-lockdown\">Keir Starmer: Boris Johnson’s chaos could hit June plan to lift lockdown</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul>","trailText":"Latest updates: UK government considering mandatory jabs for health workers; Malaysia to set up more mega vaccination centres","byline":"Nicola Slawson (now); Caroline Davies and Maya Wolfe-Robinson (earlier)","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"64032d1281fa564cbc2ff645a589e3d1b4e7ee89\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/64032d1281fa564cbc2ff645a589e3d1b4e7ee89/0_14_3072_1843/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People have lunch outside a restaurant near the Pantheon, in the centre of Rome\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People have lunch outside a restaurant near the Pantheon, in the centre of Rome on Sunday.

It is a stark figure that underlines just how serious a problem <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2021/jan/18/vaccine-inequity-puts-world-on-brink-of-catastrophic-moral-failure-says-who-chief-video\">global vaccine inequity</a> has become. But the answer for the developing world is not as simple as delivering more vaccines.</p> <p>From <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa\">Africa</a> to Latin America, Asia and the Caribbean, the same issues have been replicated. On top of finding enough doses, there have been logistical difficulties with delivery, problems over healthcare infrastructure and, in some countries, public hesitancy towards vaccines.</p> <p>Africa’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/13/african-health-workers-left-without-covid-jabs-as-paltry-supplies-dwindle\">lack of vaccines</a> – and the erratic supply of those that are eventually delivered – remains the No 1 challenge, however. Only 28 million doses have been delivered on the continent so far – that’s less than 2% of the continent’s population – at a time when some wealthier countries have vaccinated well in excess of half their populations.</p> <p>One issue is that 40 African countries, as the World Health Organization recently pointed out, had been relying on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/22/revealed-big-shortfall-in-covax-covid-vaccine-sharing-scheme\">Covax facility</a>, the scheme designed to deliver cheap doses to promote vaccine equality. Supplies were supposed to come from the Serum Institute of India but have now been diverted for domestic use in India.</p> <p>The WHO announced on Thursday that Africa needed at least 20 million <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/astrazeneca\">AstraZeneca</a> doses in the next six weeks to give second shots to all those who had received a first dose. In addition, another 200 million doses of approved vaccines are needed to enable the continent to vaccinate 10% of its population by September.</p> <p><strong>Dr Matshidiso Moeti</strong>, WHO regional director for Africa, said last week:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Africa needs vaccines now. Any pause in our vaccination campaigns will lead to lost lives and lost hope.</p> <p>It’s too soon to tell if Africa is on the cusp of a third wave.

The continued spread of the Indian coronavirus variant has prompted experts to argue restrictions should remain in place until more people have received both doses of a vaccine amid reports ministers are drawing up plans for a partial end of lockdown. NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson said a “much better quality of debate” was needed on the implications of easing measures, according to the BBC. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/may/29/we-faced-an-unprecedented-crisis-but-tens-of-thousands-of-second-wave-covid-deaths-were-avoidable-and-unforgivable\">Writing in The Observer, opposition leader Sir Keir Starmer </a>said “weak, slow decisions” by the Government on border policy had allowed the Indian variant to spread.</p> <p>Meanwhile, leaders of Australia and New Zealand have had their first face-to-face meeting since the coronavirus outbreak prompted both countries to close their borders. Australian prime minister Scott Morrison arrived in the tourist resort of Queenstown for an overnight visit on Sunday. He greeted his New Zealand counterpart Jacinda Ardern with a traditional Maori hongi, in which the pair pressed noses together. Morrison is the first major world leader to visit New Zealand since both countries shut their borders last year to contain the virus.

Scientists have warned ministers that a third wave of coronavirus may have already begun in Britain, casting doubt on plans in England to lift all lockdown restrictions in three weeks’ time. Experts cautioned that any rise in coronavirus hospital admissions could leave the NHS struggling to cope as it battles to clear the huge backlog in non-Covid cases. Downing Street insisted it was too soon for speculation about whether the plan to lift all lockdown rules in England on 21 June could go ahead, prompting calls from the hospitality industry for the government to ensure it provided “advance notice” for struggling businesses of any “lingering” measures. The vaccines minister, Nadhim Zahawi, refused to deny that some restrictions such as mask wearing and working from home might remain in place to reduce the spread of the virus. Senior scientific advisers believe that, where possible, working from home makes sense beyond June because it would cut the number of people who come into contact with each other. Ministers are grappling with whether a rise in cases and further spread of the Covid variant first discovered in India could throw Boris Johnson’s roadmap off track. Despite the progress of the vaccination programme, advisers are unsure to what extent the new infections – which are at levels last seen at the end of March – will translate into hospitalisations and deaths. Outbreak modellers advising Sage expected a resurgence of infections even before the new variant, called B.1.617.2, was found in the UK. That is because, as restrictions ease, the virus can spread more easily among millions of people who have not been protected by vaccines. Research by Public Health England that suggests the new variant is highly transmissible and partially resistant to vaccines has heightened concerns that a third wave could overwhelm the NHS. Read more by colleagues Aubrey Allegretti, Nicola Davis and Ian Sample here: Only 1% of the 1.3 billion vaccines injected around the world have been administered in Africa – and that comparative percentage has been declining in recent weeks. It is a stark figure that underlines just how serious a problem global vaccine inequity has become. But the answer for the developing world is not as simple as delivering more vaccines. From Africa to Latin America, Asia and the Caribbean, the same issues have been replicated. On top of finding enough doses, there have been logistical difficulties with delivery, problems over healthcare infrastructure and, in some countries, public hesitancy towards vaccines. Africa’s lack of vaccines – and the erratic supply of those that are eventually delivered – remains the No 1 challenge, however. Only 28 million doses have been delivered on the continent so far – that’s less than 2% of the continent’s population – at a time when some wealthier countries have vaccinated well in excess of half their populations. One issue is that 40 African countries, as the World Health Organization recently pointed out, had been relying on the Covax facility, the scheme designed to deliver cheap doses to promote vaccine equality. Supplies were supposed to come from the Serum Institute of India but have now been diverted for domestic use in India. The WHO announced on Thursday that Africa needed at least 20 million AstraZeneca doses in the next six weeks to give second shots to all those who had received a first dose. In addition, another 200 million doses of approved vaccines are needed to enable the continent to vaccinate 10% of its population by September. Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa, said last week: Africa needs vaccines now. Any pause in our vaccination campaigns will lead to lost lives and lost hope. It’s too soon to tell if Africa is on the cusp of a third wave. However, we know that cases are rising, and the clock is ticking so we urgently appeal to countries that have vaccinated their high-risk groups to speed up the dose-sharing to fully protect the most vulnerable people. Read more here: In the UK, ministers will adopt a cautious approach in deciding whether to ease lockdown on June 21, with hospitals already under pressure and health experts warning against “charging ahead”. The continued spread of the Indian coronavirus variant has cast doubt on the ability to scrap restrictions, with ministers considering plans to keep some measures - such as the continued use of face masks and guidance on working from home – in place. Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi acknowledged “we have to be cautious” because of concerns about the infection rate. The British government will wait for the latest data on June 14 before deciding whether to proceed with lifting England’s lockdown the following week. He said the vaccine programme aimed to offer a second dose to all over-50s by June 21, but he told Times Radio “I could do with more supply” because “I will be able to protect more people more rapidly”. Asked whether the remaining restrictions could be eased if cases were still increasing, he told BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show: What I’m saying to you is we have to be cautious. We have to look at the data and share it with the country. Are we still vaccinating at scale? Big tick. Are the vaccines working? Yes. But are infection rates too high for us to then not be able to proceed because there are too many people getting into hospital? I don’t know the answer to it. But we will know it on, hopefully on the 14th, a few more weeks. He said that as the virus becomes endemic “we’re going to have to live with a certain amount of Covid being transmitted”. Pressed on whether there could be a partial lifting of restrictions, with mask-wearing and working from home continuing, Zahawi said: “We need to look at the data.” Allies of Donald Trump took the unusual step of speaking out on Sunday in support of Joe Biden, regarding efforts to pinpoint the source of Covid-19 and find out if China knows more about the origins of the pandemic than it is letting on. Biden said on Thursday he was expanding an investigation into the outbreak, following a departure from previous thinking by at least one US intelligence agency now leaning towards the theory that the virus escaped from a laboratory in Wuhan. Michael McCaul, a Republican congressman from Texas, and Matthew Pottinger, Trump’s former deputy national security adviser who persuaded him to start using the controversial term “Wuhan virus”, both welcomed the development. Pottinger told NBC’s Meet the Press: It’s absolutely essential to find out what the origin of this thing is, it’s essential for us to head off the next pandemic, it’s essential for us to better understand the variants of the current pandemic that are emerging. Both of these hypotheses that President Biden spoke of are valid, it could have emerged from a laboratory, it could have emerged from nature. Neither is supported by concrete evidence but there’s a growing amount of circumstantial evidence supporting the idea that this may have leaked from a laboratory. Read the full story here: South Africa has extended its nightly curfew and limited the number of people at gatherings to slow the spread of Covid-19 as positive cases surge, President Cyril Ramaphosa said on Sunday. The level 2 lockdown restrictions will start on Monday, forcing non-essential establishments like restaurants, bars and fitness centres to close by 10pm local time as the curfew will now start at 11pm instead of midnight and end at 4am, Ramaphosa said in an address to the nation. All gatherings will be limited to a maximum of 100 people indoors from 250 and 250 people outdoors from 500. Where the venue is too small to accommodate these numbers, no more than 50% of the capacity of the venue may be used, Reuters reports. Ramaphosa said according to the country’s health experts, the recent surge in new infections is due to the increasing number of social gatherings where people are not observing essential health protocols. Funerals and so-called “after tears” parties, as well as camps and sporting activities at schools, have also been identified as other sites of increased transmission. Ramaphosa said: The Ministerial Advisory Committee on Covid-19 has therefore recommended that the country urgently implement further restrictions to limit the increase in infections. It bases this recommendation on the sustained increase in new cases in the last 14 days, increased hospital admissions in almost all provinces and an increase in the proportion of Covid tests that are positive. Over the last seven days, the country has recorded an average of 3,745 daily new infections, with cases rising by 4,515 over the past 24 hours to over 1.659 million cases. Over 960,000 people have been vaccinated in the country. The provinces of Free State, Northern Cape, North West and Gauteng, which houses Johannesburg, have reached the threshold of a third wave of infections and “it may only be a matter of time before the country as a whole will have entered a third wave”, Ramaphosa said. Egypt will lift restrictions it imposed earlier this month to curb the spread the coronavirus, including early closure of shops and restaurants, from June 1, the cabinet said. Since May 6, stores, shopping malls and restaurants had to close by 9 pm after a rise in infections, Reuters reports. Egypt imposed strict measures at the start of the pandemic, closing its airspace and setting nightly curfews to combat the spread of the virus, but it has remained largely open since June 2020. As part of its efforts to save the tourism sector, it completed vaccinating workers in all hotels in Southern Sinai and Red Sea provinces and plans to vaccinate all residents of the two resorts of Hurghada and Sharm el-Sheik, the cabinet said on Sunday. Egypt had officially confirmed 260,659 coronavirus cases including 15,001 deaths as of Saturday. However, officials and experts say the real number of infections is far higher, but is not reflected in government figures because of low testing rates and the exclusion of private test results. Italy reported 44 coronavirus-related deaths on Sunday, down from 83 the day before and the lowest figure since mid-October, while the daily tally of new infections also dropped to 2,949 from 3,351, the health ministry said. Italy has registered 126,046 deaths linked to Covid-19 since its outbreak in February last year, the second-highest toll in Europe after Britain and the seventh-highest in the world, Reuters reports. The country has reported 4.216 million cases to date. The number of deaths is often lower on a Sunday but the latest figure confirms a declining trend. People reported dead due to Covid-19 stood at 72 last Sunday and 93 a week before that, down from 139 on Sunday May 9. The number of patients in hospital with the virus – not including those in intensive care – totalled 6,591 on Sunday, down from 6,800 a day earlier. There were 27 new admissions to intensive care units, little changed from 29 on Saturday. The total number of intensive care patients stood at 1,061 from 1,095. Only 164,495 tests for Covid-19 were carried out on Sunday, sharply down from 247,330 the day before, the ministry said. Separately on Sunday, the health ministry said it had extended to June 21 the current ban on travellers arriving from India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Authorities in Vietnam have detected a new coronavirus variant that is a combination of the Covid variants first identified in India and the UK and spreads quickly by air, the health minister has said. After successfully containing the virus for most of last year, Vietnam is grappling with a rise in infections since late April that accounts for more than half of the total 6,856 registered cases. So far, there have been 47 deaths. Nguyen Thanh Long said on Saturday, describing it as a hybrid of the two known variants: Vietnam has uncovered a new Covid-19 variant combining characteristics of the two existing variants first found in India and the UK. “That the new one is an Indian variant with mutations that originally belong to the UK variant is very dangerous,” he told a government meeting, a recording of which was obtained by Reuters. The south-east Asian country had previously detected seven virus variants: B.1.222, B.1.619, D614G, B.1.1.7 – known as the UK variant, B.1.351, A.23.1 and B.1.617.2 – the India variant. Long said Vietnam would soon publish genome data of the newly identified variant, which he said was more transmissible than the previously known types.

Last week the Wall Street Journal cited US intelligence agencies who said they were told that three unnamed members of staff at a lab in the Chinese city of Wuhan were sick enough to go hospital in November 2019 with Covid-like symptoms. US intelligence chiefs later stressed they did not know how the virus was transmitted initially, but that they had two theories: either it emerged naturally from human contact with infected animals, or it was a laboratory accident. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s The World This Weekend, Dr Dale Fisher said the theory that the virus had leaked from a laboratory was “not off the table”, but remained “unverified”. Fisher, the chair of the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, which is coordinated by the WHO, urged the US to share any intelligence it had. “The Wall Street Journal is not really the way to share science,” he said. Read the full story here: Jens Spahn, the German health minister, and his counterparts in the 16 federal states will on Monday discuss control mechanisms for coronavirus test centres following fraud accusations, a ministry spokesman said on Sunday. Since allegations of potential fraud at several providers were made public this week and Spahn said on Saturday that there would be stricter controls, a debate has started on how to control the test centres and who should be in charge. Germany offers its citizens at least one free coronavirus test per week, with several federal states providing one free test a day. The state pays €18 (£15) per test. As a result, private test centres have been set up en masse in recent weeks. Some coronavirus test centres have been charging for more tests than they have carried out, daily Süddeutsche Zeitung and broadcaster ARD reported this week. Lars Klingbeil, the secretary general of the opposition Social Democrats, told daily Tagesspiegel’s Sunday edition: I find it incomprehensible that despite warnings Jens Spahn has left such loopholes for cheaters. Spahn announced more random checks on Saturday: Pragmatism is necessary these days. Those who exploit that must not be allowed to get away with it. Spahn will have a call with his state counterparts on Monday morning and discuss next steps, the spokesman said. The number of new coronavirus cases in Germany has fallen further this weekend. The Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases reported a 3,852 rise in cases on Sunday, 2,862 less than a week earlier. The seven-day rate of infection fell to 35 per 100,000 people, down from around 64 last week. So far, Germany has seen 3.68 million cases; the death toll stands at 88,406. Around 42% of its population have been given at least a first shot of a Covid-19 vaccine and 17% have had their second dose. That’s it from me, Caroline Davies, for today. Handing over to my colleague Nicola Slawson. Thanks for your time. Ministers have been urged not to “threaten” NHS staff by forcing them to get vaccinated against coronavirus under plans being considered by the government. The shadow Commons leader, Thangam Debbonaire, said it was not a “good idea” after the vaccines minister, Nadhim Zahawi, admitted the proposal was being investigated alongside the existing consultation on making jabs mandatory for social care workers. There is nervousness in Whitehall about doing anything to destabilise the vaccine rollout by requiring that people get the jab instead of keeping it voluntary – something that several behavioural scientists have warned could dampen take-up among already vaccine-hesitant groups. But after concerns that a sizeable number of health and social care staff, who were among the first to be offered the vaccine, are reluctant to get jabbed, the government has been consulting on making vaccines mandatory for care workers, and is now expanding that to include all those working in the NHS. Key developments so far today: UK vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi confirmed the government was considering whether coronavirus jabs should be compulsory for NHS staff. He said: “It’s absolutely the right thing and it would be incumbent on any responsible government to have the debate, to do the thinking as to how we go about protecting the most vulnerable by making sure that those who look after them are vaccinated. The UK government is waiting for the latest data on June 14 before deciding whether to proceed with easing the lockdown on June 21, Zahawi said. British regulators were still considering whether to offer jabs to children. Zahawi said: “Our own regulator has not yet approved giving vaccines to children. You have to make sure the vaccines are incredibly safe before you give them to children.” Italy has extended an entry ban for people coming from India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, as a continued precaution against the more transmissible Indian variant. The ban, which does not apply to Italian citizens, was introduced in late April and was due to expire on Sunday. It was prolonged until 21 June. The theory that the coronavirus outbreak began with a leak from a Chinese laboratory in Wuhan has not been ruled out, according to a health expert affiliated with the WHO. India has reported its lowest daily rise in new coronavirus infections in 46 days at 165,553 cases during the previous 24 hours, while deaths rose by 3,460. Kenya has extended its nightly curfew by 60 days to slow the spread of Covid-19, the interior ministry said. People who remain chronically ill after Covid infections in England have had to wait months for appointments and treatment at specialist clinics set up to handle the surge in patients with long Covid. More than half of people in their 30s in England have received a coronavirus vaccination in a period of little over two weeks, new figures reveal.NHS England said that, since it began opening up the vaccine rollout to this age group on May 13, 53% of those aged 30 to 39 have been given at least one dose. The leaders of Australia and New Zealand have had their first face-to-face meeting since the coronavirus outbreak prompted both countries to close their borders. Australian prime minister Scott Morrison arrived in the tourist resort of Queenstown for an overnight visit on Sunday. He greeted his New Zealand counterpart Jacinda Ardern with a traditional Maori hongi, in which the pair pressed noses together. People who remain chronically ill after Covid infections in England have had to wait months for appointments and treatment at specialist clinics set up to handle the surge in patients with long Covid. MPs called on Matt Hancock to explain the lengthy waiting times and what they described as a “shameful postcode lottery” which left some patients facing delays of more than four months before being assessed at a specialist centre while others were seen within days. NHS England announced in December that people with long Covid, or post-Covid syndrome, could seek help at more than 60 specialist clinics. But despite government assertions in January that the network of 69 centres was already operating, the all-party parliamentary group on coronavirus found that some clinics were still not up and running three months later. The theory that the coronavirus outbreak began with a leak from a Chinese laboratory in Wuhan has not been ruled out, according to a health expert affiliated with the WHO. Dr Dale Fisher, chair of the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, which is coordinated by the WHO, said the WHO’s investigation into the origins of the virus had only just begun. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s World This Weekend he said: “The lab leak theory is not off the table, there’s more research to be done.” An investigation visit by WHO experts earlier this year, which was highly controlled by the Chinese authorities, concluded it “extremely unlikely” that the pandemic began with a laboratory incident. Fisher said this theory remained “unverified” despite a report, based on US intelligence, which claimed three members of staff at the lab had become sick with Covid-like in early December 2019. He urged the US to share this intelligence. Fisher said: “We believe that all the laboratory workers have had serology [tests] done and all those antibody tests were negative and that was part of the reason why the risk was downplayed.” Fisher added: “WHO could do itself a favour, by describing the plans for further investigation because people really haven’t heard anything since the February mission was done and therefore people think they’ve stopped looking for the origins, which is far from the truth, it’s only really just begun.” He also suggested China’s secrecy about the origins of the virus could be driven by fears of compensation claims. Fisher said: “Any country that found any Covid-19 in its borders before the outbreak started would suddenly clam up. This is why I would argue that diplomacy is the way forward with this, creating a no blame culture. The only way you really can get to the bottom of this is just to say ‘look there’s no penalties, we just need to sort this out’.” Kenya has extended its nightly curfew by 60 days to slow the spread of Covid-19, the interior ministry said, according to the Reuters news agency. The move followed a decision by President Uhuru Kenyatta in late March to extend the 10pm to 4am curfew. A ban on political gatherings and processions that could turn into super spreader events was also extended for 60 days, as was a prohibition on overnight events and vigils, the ministry said. When the first coronavirus cases were confirmed in Kenya in March 2020, the government closed schools, imposed a curfew, banned public gatherings and on multiple occasions restricted movement in and out of the most-affected regions. Some restrictions, such as on schools, were eventually relaxed. The ban on public gatherings and processions and overnight meetings will stay in force, the ministry said. Kenya has recorded 170,485 cases and 3,141 deaths, Ministry of Health data showed on Saturday, with a positivity rate of 8.9%. Covid-19 vaccinations began on March 5 and so far 968,733 people have received their first dose. Boris Johnson faces a difficult decision about whether to end England’s lockdown on June 21 with hospitals already under “worrying” pressure, a health chief has warned. According to the Press Association news agency, NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson said hospital bosses were concerned about the transmissibility of the B1617.2 variant and the large number of people who have still to receive doses of the vaccine. He warned that although hospitals were not expecting to be overwhelmed by a surge of Covid-19 cases, they were already stretched by going “full pelt” on dealing with the backlog of cases built up during the pandemic and urgent care needs. Hopson said: Significant numbers of Covid-19 hospital inpatients will adversely impact care backlog recovery, (the) current degree of pressure on hospitals is worrying especially since we saw clear summer demand surges in the two years before Covid-19. But if, as evidence above suggests, success of (the) vaccination campaign means much lower levels of hospitalisation, serious illness and mortality, even with (the) new variant, that is very significant and important. This means there is a difficult decision to make for June 21. He also suggested the government needs to consider the increased burden on hospitals in UK holiday hotspots in coming months with people not travelling abroad, saying one trust chief on the south coast had warned they will “struggle” to meet the “significant extra demand”. Dr Mike Tildesley, a member of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (Spi-M) Government advisory panel, said there was still “quite a lot of uncertainty” around the June 21 date. He told LBC radio scientists had “an awful lot of work to do” to analyse data on the link between cases and hospital admissions, while bearing in mind the situation with the Indian variant, to give evidence to the government. South Korea will get 1m doses of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s vaccine this week mainly to inoculate military personnel, after the United States almost doubled a pledge made earlier this month, prime minister Kim Boo-kyum said on Sunday. South Korea has reported a lower death toll than many comparable developed countries from Covid-19, but the government has come under criticism for a comparatively slow rollout of vaccines, Reuters reports. Less than 11% of its 52 million people have so far received a first dose. US President Joe Biden, at his first summit with President Moon Jae-in earlier this month, promised to supply 550,000 shots for South Korean troops. Kim said that offer had now been increased to 1m doses, and the shots will arrive this week. On care homes, UK vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi today defended the government approach. Boris Johnson’s former aide Dominic Cummings claimed the health secretary, Matt Hancock, had lied to the prime minister over tests being carried out on those discharged into care homes – a charge denied by Hancock. Zahawi said the government had made the best use of the limited testing capacity available when the pandemic struck and it had put a “protective ring” around care homes. Asked whether Hancock had promised care home residents would be tested before discharge from hospital, Zahawi told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: Matt Hancock was very much focused on delivery, I think it’s worth putting this in context … in the sense that in the eye of the storm, we were only able to do 2,000 tests a day. The diagnostics industry was almost non-existent in the UK. He added Hancock had said that “people going into care homes absolutely should be tested and the system, the NHS, operationalised that” as testing capacity increased. Asked why people had been sent home without tests, Zahawi said “hindsight is a wonderful thing”, adding: We can sit here and sort of argue the toss about asymptomatic transmission … and when we really knew about that. The whole point is you use every resource available to you, to the best of your ability, to save and to protect as many people as possible. There have been more than 36,275 deaths involving Covid-19 in care homes since the pandemic began. Zahawi said: When the inquiry is held, and we will look at all these things in detail, we will of course examine where we could do better. But to say that we didn’t deal with them to the best of our capability, with the resources that were available to us, is a mistake, is wrong. Italy has extended an entry ban for people coming from India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, as a continued precaution against the more transmissible Indian variant. The ban, which does not apply to Italian citizens, was introduced in late April and was due to expire on Sunday. It was prolonged until 21 June, a spokesman for Italian health minister Roberto Speranza said in a statement. Care homes were “forgotten” during the “dreadful” early stages of the Covid pandemic in the UK, a sector leader has said. Mike Padgham, the chairman of the Independent Care Group, which represents providers in York and North Yorkshire, told Sky News it had been a “frightening” time for staff and residents. Padgham was questioned in relation to the claim made by former Downing Street adviser Dominic Cummings to MPs this week that suggestions care homes were shielded were “complete nonsense”. Padgham said: I don’t believe myself there was a ring of protection thrown round us. In those very early days it was difficult. We were forgotten. We’ve been forgotten over decades. That’s the only issue in social care. We weren’t prepared. We weren’t ready. We didn’t have the PPE, we didn’t have the testing. And it took the government many, many weeks to actually see what was happening in homes, despite our best efforts and protestations. That is why providers … without their efforts, the figures … would have been much worse.” Vietnam’s business hub Ho Chi Minh City will begin social distancing measures in the city for 15 days starting from Monday in an effort to curb the spread of the coronavirus, according to the state-run Tuoi Tre newspaper reported on Sunday. “All events that gather more than 10 people in public are banned city-wide, but the city is considering to lower the number of people to just five,” the newspaper reported. “While all citizens of Go Vap district are not allowed to go out if not necessary,” the report added. Ho Chi Minh City earlier this week shut down shops and restaurants. A leading scientist has called for stallholders at the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan to be interviewed in any further investigation of the Covid-19 epidemic. Dr Eddie Holmes has joined a growing chorus of voices calling for further investigation into the source of the pandemic. The US president, Joe Biden, has ordered the US intelligence community to intensify its efforts to study the origins of coronavirus, as the theory that the virus might have come from a lab in Wuhan gains traction. He revealed that two of the 18 intelligence agencies are leaning towards the animal link and one leans more toward the lab theory. It is still thought by many that the market in Wuhan is at the centre of the Covid-19 breakout and that the virus jumped from an animal species to humans. On 31 January 2021, a team of scientists led by the World Health Organization visited the market. However, according to their report only two stall operators were interviewed, and neither was engaged in trading wildlife. Edward Holmes, an expert in the evolution and emergence of infectious diseases at the University of Sydney, who saw live wildlife being traded at the Huanan market in 2014, said: “As wildlife present the greatest risk, this should have been the priority in the WHO’s investigation of the market. “However, I’m not sure who controlled the WHO’s schedule so it may have been out of their hands,” he added. “At the very least these stallholders need to be reinterviewed in any additional investigation into the virus origins.” Taiwan reported 355 domestic Covid-19 cases on Sunday. After recording just a handful of daily infections for months, Taiwan is dealing with relatively large numbers of community transmissions, though infection rates are starting to fall. It has only vaccinated around 1% of its more than 23 million people but has almost 30 million shots on order, from AstraZeneca Plc, Moderna Inc and two domestic firms. The UK government is waiting for the latest data on June 14 before deciding whether to proceed with easing the lockdown on June 21, vaccine minister Nadhim Zahawi said. Asked whether that step could be taken if cases were still increasing, he told BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show: What I’m saying to you is we have to be cautious. We have to look at the data and share it with the country. Are we still vaccinating at scale? Big tick. Are the vaccines working? Yes. But are infection rates too high for us to then not be able to proceed because there are too many people getting into hospital? I don’t know the answer to it. But we will know it on, hopefully on the 14th, a few more weeks. He said that as the virus becomes endemic “we’re going to have to live with a certain amount of Covid being transmitted”. On the possible compulsory vaccination of NHS staff in the UK, the shadow cabinet minister Thangam Debbonaire said “threatening” NHS staff to have the vaccine was not a good idea. The shadow Commons leader told Sky News: Given we have got a recruitment crisis in parts of the NHS I think it’s far more important we try and work with staff rather than against them. Threatening staff, I don’t think is a good idea.” Public Health England and the NHS had been successful when they had worked with people to address their doubts and answer questions about the jab, she said. I would like to see the government work with the NHS and social care staff. More on the question of vaccinating children, one expert has said that the emergence of new variants could influence the decision in the UK. Prof Peter Openshaw, a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), told Times Radio that there were “debates” about the possible risks of “very, very rare complications” associated with vaccination, which had to be balanced against the “certainty” that someone can get “very severe complications” by catching Covid. Speaking in a personal capacity, he added: It may well be that actually giving children vaccines will become a clearer option once we know more about the disease in children and whether the new variants are spreading further into the paediatric population and causing more significant disease. That could certainly change the risk-benefit ratio.” Prof Openshaw said the UK placed an emphasis on “public health benefits” and therefore “vaccinating those who may be transmitting disease, sometimes unknowingly, is a perfectly good justification for vaccination”. He added: The new variants extending further down the age range and being of quite high prevalence even in children as young as four, it may be that actually children and school children are going to be a more important part of the transmission chain as the virus becomes more transmissible as new variants arise. So... the benefits might change and that might affect the decision about whether to vaccinate children in the future. British regulators were still considering whether to offer jabs to children, UK vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi told Sky News: Our own regulator has not yet approved giving vaccines to children. You have to make sure the vaccines are incredibly safe before you give them to children. The Pfizer jab has been approved for use in 12-year-olds by regulators in the European Union, US and Canada and Zahawi said the “infrastructure” was in place to jab children in the UK if required. But he said the issue was complicated because the main benefits of the jab were not necessarily felt by children themselves but instead by those around them. He said: On the whole you are vaccinating to protect their families and their communities and the country. UK vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi confirmed the government was considering whether coronavirus jabs should be compulsory for NHS staff. He told Sky News: It’s absolutely the right thing and it would be incumbent on any responsible government to have the debate, to do the thinking as to how we go about protecting the most vulnerable by making sure that those who look after them are vaccinated. There is precedent for this, obviously surgeons get vaccinated for hepatitis B, so it’s something that we are absolutely thinking about. He also said that the World Health Organisation investigation must be able to fully investigate the origins of the pandemic. The Sunday Times reported that British agents believe it is “feasible” that the crisis began with a coronavirus leak from a Chinese research laboratory in Wuhan. Asked about the report, Zahawi said: I think it’s really important that the WHO is allowed to conduct its investigation unencumbered into the origins of this pandemic and that we should leave no stone unturned to understand why – not only because of the current pandemic that has swept the world but also for future-proofing the world’s capability to deal with pandemics. Russia reported 9,694 new cases on Sunday, the highest number since the end of March, which took the national tally to 5,063,442 infections. The Russian coronavirus taskforce said that 355 more deaths of Covid-19 patients were confirmed in the past 24 hours, bringing the official death toll to 121,162. The federal statistics agency has kept a separate count and has said Russia recorded around 250,000 deaths related to Covid-19 from April 2020 to March 2021, Reuters reports. The British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) chief executive Emma McClarkin has called on the UK government to provide advance notice to businesses if restrictions are to remain after June 21. McClarkin acknowledged the government was in a “difficult situation” but said Whitehall had to “stick to its road map”. She told BBC Breakfast: We need the Government to stick to its road map of removing those restrictions by the 21st of June if we want to see the great British pub really begin its recovery. What I need to say is June 21 is absolutely critical to the recovery of the sector. Recovery day only starts when the restrictions are removed. If the Government does leave any lingering restrictions in play then they really need to give us advance notice of that and it needs to talk seriously about financial compensation. But right now we are asking the Government to stick to their road map. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 3,852 to 3,679,148, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Sunday. The reported death toll rose by 56 to 88,406, the tally showed. Malaysia is planning to set up more mega vaccination centres and get private doctors to join immunisation efforts, after five consecutive days of record daily coronavirus infections, Reuters reports. Science minister Khairy Jamaluddin told a virtual news briefing on Sunday that the government will set up another five mega vaccination centres around the capital, Kuala Lumpur, and are considering two in the northen state of Penang and in the southern state of Johor. Nearly 6% of the country’s 32 million people have been vaccinated, according to the website of the governmental Special Committee for Ensuring Access to COVID-19 Vaccine Supply. Khairy said the government is also looking to allow drive-through vaccination centres in the country, after guidelines are firmed up. Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin on Friday announced a nationwide total lockdown from June 1-14 in an effort to curb the spread of the virus. Malaysia reported 6,999 new cases on Sunday, bringing the total infections in the country to 565,533. More than half of people in their 30s in England have received a coronavirus vaccination in a period of little over two weeks, new figures reveal. NHS England said that, since it began opening up the vaccine rollout to this age group on May 13, 53% of those aged 30 to 39 have been given at least one dose. The data comes as Prof Stephen Reicher, a psychologist on the Sage sub-committee advising ministers on behavioural science, said the government was in a “pickle” because it appeared to have abandoned the “data not dates” principle. The NHS, meanwhile, is asking people aged 50 and older, as well as those who are clinically vulnerable, to bring forward their second Covid-19 vaccination to help combat the spread of the B1.617.2 variant first identified in India. It follows the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) recommending earlier this month that the second dose interval be shortened from 12 weeks to eight for people in priority cohorts. India today reported its lowest daily rise in new coronavirus infections in 46 days at 165,553 cases during the previous 24 hours, while deaths rose by 3,460. The south Asian nation’s tally of infections now stands at 27.9m, with a death toll of 325,972, health ministry data showed on Sunday. Good morning, and welcome to the coronavirus global blog. Caroline Davies here, taking you through key developments today. You can get in touch on caroline.davies@theguardian.com. In the UK, there are calls for a more informed debate on the planned lifting of all legal limits on social contact in England on June 21 as Labour questioned if the move would proceed. The continued spread of the Indian coronavirus variant has prompted experts to argue restrictions should remain in place until more people have received both doses of a vaccine amid reports ministers are drawing up plans for a partial end of lockdown. NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson said a “much better quality of debate” was needed on the implications of easing measures, according to the BBC. Writing in The Observer, opposition leader Sir Keir Starmer said “weak, slow decisions” by the Government on border policy had allowed the Indian variant to spread. Meanwhile, leaders of Australia and New Zealand have had their first face-to-face meeting since the coronavirus outbreak prompted both countries to close their borders. Australian prime minister Scott Morrison arrived in the tourist resort of Queenstown for an overnight visit on Sunday.

Morrison is the first major world leader to visit New Zealand since both countries shut their borders last year to contain the virus. The neighbours opened a quarantine-free travel bubble last month, although a recent outbreak of the virus in Melbourne has prompted New Zealand to suspend the arrangement with Victoria state.","charCount":"41850","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/nicola-slawson\">Nicola Slawson</a> (now); <a href=\"profile/carolinedavies\">Caroline Davies</a> and <a href=\"profile/maya-wolfe-robinson\">Maya Wolfe-Robinson</a> (earlier)"},{"headline":"BBC Covid distancing sensor devices beset by noise and fire safety issues","standfirst":"<p>Staff claim body-worn proximity devices have been withdrawn after one started smoking</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus – latest updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul>","trailText":"Staff claim body-worn proximity devices have been withdrawn after one started smoking","byline":"Jim Waterson Media editor","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e678f1d903405e44fb2006e84def3fcb321f0cfe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e678f1d903405e44fb2006e84def3fcb321f0cfe/0_349_8192_4914/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Broadcasting House\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Broadcasting House, the headquarters of the BBC in London. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>When the BBC bought thousands of proximity sensors in January, the hope was that they would protect staff by aiding compliance with Covid-19 social distancing rules in newsrooms.

Maroš Šefčovič said he was looking at “solutions” to iron out disruption to businesses caused by the protocol, a key part of the Brexit agreement designed to protect the bloc’s single market at its frontier with the UK on the island of Ireland, without a return to a hard border. It means Northern Ireland has in effect stayed within the EU’s single market for goods, and a customs border was enforced on goods crossing the Irish sea. The resulting checks at the ports of Belfast and Larne have angered unionists and loyalists, who feel the region is being separated from the rest of the UK, and this anger has escalated into threats, violence and rioting. Edwin Poots, who earlier this month succeeded Arlene Foster as the leader of the Democratic Unionist party, claimed on the BBC’s Andrew Marr show on Sunday that the EU Commission “don’t seem to care for the peace process in Northern Ireland and that really needs to change”. The DUP is calling for the protocol to be scrapped, and Poots told Marr the checks were “doing demonstrable harm to every individual in Northern Ireland” and “having a devastating impact”, agreeing the violence could get worse as summer and the perennially tense marching season approaches. Šefčovič, who is in charge from Brussels’ side of leading talks with the UK’s Michael Gove and David Frost to adapt the protocol, later defended the arrangement, saying it presented “opportunity” and would take care of daily problems in Northern Ireland. He said he was investigating how to address issues arising from the protocol, but insisted it would be wrong to scrap it completely. In response to Poots’ accusation that Brussels was treating Northern Ireland as a “plaything”, Šefčovič said there was “plenty of opportunity” to transform the protocol into “something positive, good for the future which would guarantee the peace, stability and prosperity for all”. He promised to take soundings from the DUP and other political parties in Northern Ireland before his next meeting with Frost in London, expected to take place in several weeks. Recalling his talks with Gove last December, when the post-Brexit trade deal was signed, Šefčovič said he had offered Swiss-style transition agreements on matters such as veterinary issues, which would prevent someone with guide dogs needing a certificate proving they were free of rabies to take the animals from Great Britain into Northern Ireland. He added he was ready to offer solutions to solve current problems, but added the UK “just need to get over, I would say, ideology into pragmatism and real politics and go for this type of veterinary agreement, which could be done just like this within a few weeks”.","charCount":"2901","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/aubrey-allegretti\">Aubrey Allegretti</a> Political correspondent"},{"headline":"Fate Now Conquers: Kanneh-Mason/Chineke!/Edusei review – fine sounds of celebration","standfirst":"<p><strong>Royal Festival Hall, London</strong><br>Chineke!

Whatever the disappointments of such a long period of closure, the mood as the players of Chineke! Orchestra took to the stage was celebratory. That this ensemble was chosen to be first back shows how far it has come in its six-year existence. There were cheers as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/02/chi-chi-nwanoku-classical-music-living-colour-black-orchestra-chineke-foundation\">Chineke!’s founder Chi-chi Nwanoku</a> was presented with Making Music’s Sir Charles Groves prize, and more of them at the mention of <a href=\"https://www.makingmusic.org.uk/news/england-step-3-guidance-choirs\">that organisation’s campaign</a> for amateur choirs to be allowed to rehearse together again.</p> <p>There is indeed always campaigning to be done in the music world – but at least Chineke!’s work as an amplifier for composers of colour is bearing fruit. This concert began with two works written last year. The first, a UK premiere, was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRtSnnOI0OM\">Fate Now Conquers by Carlos Simon</a>, a breezy, motoring overture with the harmonies of the second movement of Beethoven’s Symphony No 7 as its jumping-off point.

Whatever the disappointments of such a long period of closure, the mood as the players of Chineke! Orchestra took to the stage was celebratory. That this ensemble was chosen to be first back shows how far it has come in its six-year existence. There were cheers as Chineke!’s founder Chi-chi Nwanoku was presented with Making Music’s Sir Charles Groves prize, and more of them at the mention of that organisation’s campaign for amateur choirs to be allowed to rehearse together again. There is indeed always campaigning to be done in the music world – but at least Chineke!’s work as an amplifier for composers of colour is bearing fruit. This concert began with two works written last year. The first, a UK premiere, was Fate Now Conquers by Carlos Simon, a breezy, motoring overture with the harmonies of the second movement of Beethoven’s Symphony No 7 as its jumping-off point. Desmond Neysmith made something lovely of the cello solo at its centre. The second, Remnants – streamed in a Chineke! concert last autumn but now being performed in front of an audience for the first time – was inspired by something that happened right outside the Southbank Centre: the image of Patrick Hutchinson, grim-faced and determined, carrying a counterprotester to safety during last summer’s Black Lives Matter demonstrations. James B Wilson’s music is essentially a frame for words delivered by the poet Yomi Sode – a brief, portentous prelude, an even briefer ending hinting at catharsis, and between them some drones supporting Sode’s words of anger and reflection. It’s a powerfully direct work. Perhaps only Chineke! would programme it right next to Dvořák’s beloved, super-romantic Cello Concerto, and that’s greatly to this ensemble’s credit. In the Dvořák, the soloist was Sheku Kanneh-Mason, his playing expansive and lyrical for the most part yet especially striking in the moments of greatest tenderness; the ending was beautifully handled.

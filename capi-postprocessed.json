They also missed the best chance of the game when the captain Joss Labadie cleared the bar from five yards.

This is, gulp, the 1671st and final game of another soul-stirring EFL season, and one way or another it’s going end on a high. By 5pm, at a push 6pm, one of these teams will be in the giddiest of stratospheres: League One.</p> <p>Morecambe have never played in the third tier before; nor have this iteration of Newport County. They were last in the old Division Three in 1986-87, a couple of years before the club went out of business. A reformed team started in the <a href=\"https://www.hellenicleague.co.uk/\">Hellenic League</a>, where they played the likes of Kintbury Rangers and Almondsbury Picksons, and eventually returned to the Football League in 2013 under the late, legendary Justin Edinburgh.</p> <p>Since then they have been ever-present in League Two, though they came heartobliteratingly close to promotion when they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/25/newport-tranmere-league-two-play-off-final-report\">lost in controversial circumstances to Tranmere two years ago</a>. They are a different team now. Their manager Michael Flynn used the first lockdown to <a href=\"https://www.skysports.com/football/news/29026/12318917/michael-flynn-interview-newport-countys-hometown-hero-on-the-style-change-thats-taken-them-to-wembley\">plan a style overhaul</a>, and this season Newport have brought a bit of tiki-taka to south Wales.</p> <p>At Morecambe, there has been a change of substance. This is only the second time since they became a Football League team in 2007 that they have finished in the top 10. In the last five years their league positions have been 21st, 18th, 22nd (when they avoided relegation to the National League on goal difference), 18th and 22nd. In his first full season, and with precisely £0 to spend on transfer fees, their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/may/30/morecambe-miracle-adams-aims-to-take-side-to-new-heights-at-wembley\">Scottish manager Derek Adams has done an astonishing job</a>. </p> <p>The play-off final, particularly in the Championship, is usually framed in financial terms. Nobody gives a stuff about money today; this one’s for the glory.</p> <p><strong>Kick off </strong>3pm.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-05-31T13:31:13.736Z\">at 2.31pm BST</time></p>  </div>","wordcount":"4082","firstPublicationDate":"2021-05-31T13:00:23Z","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2021-05-31T16:46:14Z","liveBloggingNow":"true","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/p/hj6b6","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/b805acc4e1dc1154b980433431a0bcb027cc62e4/22_0_3455_2074/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","isLive":"true","bodyText":"“Morecambe and Sunderland at the same level...” says Brad Wilson. “Gotta love it. Well done Shrimpers!” The goalscorer Carlos Mendes Gomes speaks “I feel like I’ve worked all my life for moments like this. It’s unbelievable - I know how much it means to Morecambe. It’s my first professional club and they’ve treated me like part of the family since I arrived. “If I was writing my own story I probably would have done it this way, scoring in front of the Morecambe fans. I just tried to stay as calm as possible and put the penalty in. [At this point Cole Stockton walks over, kisses Mendes Gomes on the head and shouts, ‘He’s a little magician!’] “My family have supported me my whole career [he was in the Atletico Madrid youth system six years ago]. It hasn’t always been easy but now I’ve found another family at Morecambe. It’s just amazing to actually do well for them.” The Morecambe players and staff started celebrating prematurely when the whistle was blown for an offside decision. But 20 seconds later it happened for real, sparking celebrations of rare joy at Wembley. This is a staggering achievement for a team who finished 22nd last season, and who didn’t spend a penny in the summer. In truth, the scoreline is really harsh on Newport - they dominated the game, should have had a penalty early on and then lost to a dodgy penalty. They also missed the best chance of the game when the captain Joss Labadie cleared the bar from five yards. Football is a cruel game, and a beautiful one. Full time: Morecambe 1-0 Newport History is made! Morecambe have been promoted to the third tier for the first time! 120+3 min The corner is headed away, lobbed back in and then booted clear. 120+2 min Corner to Newport. This is their last chance... 120+1 min Three added minutes. Mendes Gomes can’t watch. 120 min Demetriou’s long throw is headed down towards Ellison, who can’t sort his feet out in the six-yard box and falls over the ball! It wasn’t an easy chance, as he was running away from goal, but even so. Yes? No? 117 min Newport have lost their heads since going behind. It’s easy to criticise them for that, but I’m not sure most of us would be any better in the circumstances. They feel they have been robbed in the play-off final for the second time in three years. 116 min Folk always talk about the agony and the ecstasy of the playoffs, and this has been a textbook example. In the 104th minute, the Newport captain Joss Labadie missed a sitter. Three minutes later, Carlos Mendes Gomes put Morecambe ahead. 115 min Ellison appeals for a penalty when his cross deflects behind off Mellor. There was nothing in that. The corner is lofted deep and headed wide under pressure by Bennett. 114 min The goalscorer Carlos Mendes Gomes is replaced by Alex Kenyon. 113 min “My first instinct was penalty so I can see why the ref has given it, and he only has one look at it,” says Sam Campbell. “But it was a foul outside the box.” Agreed. I can see why he gave it, though I also think the hasty introduction of VAR has led to a complete loss of nerve and judgement among referees, and even armchair referees. 112 min Since the goal there has been an understandable desperation to both teams’ play. O’Sullivan, the hero/villain of the piece, is booked for flattening a Newport player with a body check. 111 min Newport make their final substitution. Ryan Haynes, who gave away the penalty, is replaced by Priestley Farquharson. 110 min Mendes Gomes was booked for taking off his shirt after scoring. 109 min There is a case for a penalty for that challenge by Haynes, but I think it would have been overturned if VAR was being used. Newport cursed the lack of VAR two years ago, and it’s happening again. Morecambe are 13 minutes away from making history! Carlos Mendes Gomes, their player of the season, sent King the wrong way and swept the penalty to his left. Newport are fuming, with good reason; I really don’t think that should have been a penalty. Mendes Gomes scores! PENALTY TO MORECAMBE! Lyons plays a reverse pass to O’Sullivan, who goes down under challenge from Haynes. I’m not sure it was a foul, and it might have been outside the box as well. 106 min Peep peep! Newport begin the last 15 minutes of the season. Another change for Morecambe. Kelvin Mellor is on for Liam Gibson. That miss will haunt Joss Labadie if Newport aren’t promoted. It was an instinctive touch, and he might have been put off by Ellison in front of him. But he should still have scored. 104 min: What a chance for Newport! Maynard gets round the back - it’s the only way to beat them - on the right side of the area and hammers a cross towards the near post. It’s missed by the stretching Ellison and flicked over the bar from five yards by Labadie. That was the best chance of the match by a distance. 103 min Kevin Ellisonwatch: he’s been quiet. Morecambe fans may feel he’s been too darn quiet. 102 min O’Sullivan runs at Haynes down the right and is fouled just outside the area. The assistant referee disagrees and gives a goalkick to Newport. 100 min The fear of defeat is overpowering the hope of victory. Morecambe have a hint of a chance when Songo’o finds Mendes Gomes 20 yards from goal, but he runs into trouble. 98 min I wonder what Goldie Lookin Chain, Newport’s finest, are up to right now. 96 min The Newport captain Labadie is booked for a late tackle on Songo’o. 95 min Morecambe, who had so little of the ball in the second half, are playing with greater intent in extra time. These things are relative, though, and penalties is still the likeliest outcome. 93 min Morecambe have reverted to 4-2-3-1, with Yann Songo’o moving back into midfield. 92 min A fast cross from Cooney flashes well wide off the head of Stockton, 12 yards from goal. It was a half chance at best. 91 min Morecambe made a change during the break: the fit again John O’Sullivan is on for Aaron Wildig. 91 min Peep peep! We’re off again. “Has there ever been a worse game at Wembley?” asks Luke Conway. Oh yes. Just as in 2019, Newport’s play-off final is going to extra-time. At least they have 11 men this time. 90+5 min Demetriou throws it short to Sheehan, whose cross is headed away with authority by Lavelle. 90+5 min One last long throw from Demetriou... 90+3 min: GOOD SAVE FROM LETHEREN! Haynes’ precise free-kick bounces just in front of Letheren, who shovels it round the post as he dives to his left. It looked a fairly tame effort at first but it very nearly sneaked into the net. 90+2 min Songo’o and Taylor have an impromptu wrestle 30 yards from goal. Bobby Madley calls it in favour of Newport, which means another free-kick in a promising position. 90+1 min Five added minutes. 90 min They don’t: Sheehan blooters it onto the running track. Is there a running track? You get the point. 89 min Maynard cleverly draws a foul by backing into Diagouraga 30 yards from goal. If Newport score from this, Morecambe will argue forever that the free-kick should have gone the other way. 88 min A reminder of what happened when Ellison scored against Morecambe in March. 87 min Wildig is rightly penalised for handball just before he slams a rising drive against the bar. 86 min Here comes the big man: 42-year-old Kevin Ellison, who spent nine years at Morecambe, replaces Lewis Collins. I’m pretty sure Collins was born after Ellison made his Premier League debut. 85 min Collins’ dangerous cross is headed away by the increasingly outstanding Songo’o. 84 min Kevin Ellison is getting ready to come on. Who has written his script today? 83 min Wildig’s clipped, outswinging corner is headed wide at the near post by Lavelle, 10 yards out. The Newport defender, don’t ask me who it was because it’s not going to happen, did really well to ensure he couldn’t get a clean header at goal. 82 min Labadie is penalised for what looked a decent tackle on Cooney. Songo’o fires the free-kick into Mendes Gomes, whose sharp cross on the turn is booted behind for a corner. 81 min A couple of corners in quick succession for Newport. The second, taken by Haynes on the right, leads to a bit of a scramble in the area before Stockton knees it clear. 79 min Newport make their third substitution: Nicky Maynard is on for Padraig Amond. 78 min: Good save from Letheren! It’s all Newport now. After a couple of long-range shots are blocked, Shephard has another try with a left-footed drive from 25 yards. Letheren gets down smartly to his right to push it round the post. That’s his best save of the match. 75 min A Morecambe change. Liam McAlinden, who has had a quiet game, is replaced by Brad Lyons. 74 min Haynes’ cross is headed out by Songo’o, who has had a fine game, and Morecambe break. Mendes Gomes plays the ball up to Stockton, who is shoved over on the halfway line by Bennett. That might have been a booking. 73 min Sheehan’s imaginative through pass is slightly too heavy for Labadie, and the ball runs out for a goalkick. 71 min Lewis Collins has looked dangerous since moving to the right wing when Taylor came on for Newport. Morecambe are starting to look a little weary. 69 min “I’m cheering on the Shrimps from Perth, Australia,” says Lindsay Dick. “I’ve had a soft spot for them for years, mistly for the fact that a shrimp is a hilarious team symbol. Some promising signs so far but playing on the counter is always nerve-racking. The long throws on both sides are a delight.” 68 min It’s time for another drinks break. 66 min A defensive clearance comes to Cooney, 30 yards out. He pushes the ball forward and hits a fierce, wobbling shot that bounces up awkwardly in front of King, who changes direction to push it away. That was Morecambe’s first shot on target and only the fourth of the match. 64 min Demetriou’s long throw is headed up in the air by the substitute Taylor. It drops towards Lewis Collins, whose optimistic overhead kick loops onto the roof of the net. 62 min Two substitutions for Newport: Anthony Hartigan and Ryan Taylor replace Aaron Lewis and Matthew Dolan. 61 min Lewis and Bennett play nice short passes in a tight space on the edge of the area, forcing Mendes Gomes to get in front of Amond and concede a corner. Newport look the likelier scorers, though there isn’t a huge amount in it. 60 min A crisp low strike from Sheehan, 25 yards out, is well held to his right by Letheren. 56 min I don’t know what to say really. Both teams are huffung and puffing but very little has happened in the second half. 52 min Another quiet spell in the game. Newport have been the stronger side since half-time though, and we all know about their options on the bench. 48 min Newport have made a fast start to the second half. A long kick from the keeper King is headed infield by Amond and miscontrolled by Labadie on the edge of the area. His poor touch turns into a pass to Collins, whose deflected shot is saved by the keeper Letheren as he falls to his left. 47 min Morecambe switched to a back three during the first half, with Songo’o dropping in from midfield. I completely missed it, I won’t lie to you, but it was highlighted by the excellent Sky Sports punditry team during the break. 46 min Peep peep! Morecambe begin the second half. No changes on either side, but Kevin Ellison has been warming up with intent. “Hi Rob,” says Richard Mason in Dublin. “I’m cheering Morecambe on today for no other reason than that in 2006 I went for a day trip with pals to Nottingham. We went to Meadow Lane to watch Notts County take on the Shrimps and ended up in the Morecambe end with our shoes on our hands singing a chorus of ‘shoes off... if you love the Shrimps’. We later went to the greyhound track in Notts and won a tidy sum. A fond memory we still talk about, and the reason I’m watching this match sans shoes. Up the Shrimps!” Half-time listening Peep peep! A cagey half ends goalless. Both teams played plenty of good football without creating too many clear chances. Liam Gibson had a shot cleared off the line for Morecambe; Newport’s best efforts came from Scot Bennett, a header and a deflected shot that both went just wide. They also had a case for a penalty when Bennett was punched in the face by the Morecambe keeper Kyle Letheren after beating him to the ball for the aforementioned header. 45+3 min I know Newport have embraced tiki-taka, but that Bennett shot was a rare demonstration of Ramba-Zamba. Sheehan played the Gunter Netzer role, with Bennett moving forward from the back like Franz Beckenbauer. 45+2 min The resulting corner is headed over by Demetriou in front of the near post. 45+1 min: So close from Bennett! Sheehan brings the ball forward and slides a nice pass between the lines to Bennett, 35 yards from goal. He runs at a backpedalling defence and drives a shot that takes a big deflection off Songo’o, wrongfoots the keeper Letheren and drifts this far wide of the post. 45 min Three minutes of added time. 42 min: Off the line by Shephard! Lewis misses a clearance 25 yards from goal, allowing Mendes Gomes to slide the ball through to Gibson in the area. He screws it back past the outrushing King, but Shephard gets back to block. That was a vital bit of defending because, although there was another Newport player on the line, I think Gibson’s shot would have sneaked in the far corner. 41 min Lewis sees Wildig’s misplaced optimism and raises it by trying a long-range volley - a proper volley, not one of those bouncing non-volleys - from a tight angle. Goalkick to Morecambe. 40 min In the Premier League, Sheehan might have been sent off for that tackle. In League Two, nobody really batted an eyelid. It’s the little differences. 39 min Sheehan ploughs through Cooney, taking both man and ball. Play continues and Morecambe break promisingly, and then Wildig goes and spoils it all by saying something stupid like, ‘I fancy a pop from 25 yards’. 35 min There’s a break in play after 34 minutes so that both sets of players and fans can applaud the late Christian Mbulu. 34 min For all the promising approach play, there has only been one shot on target in the match, Sheehan’s dribbler in the 24th minute. 32 min The corner is headed away to Sheehan, who shoots well wide from the edge of the area. 31 min Amond runs onto a classy backheel from Collins in the inside-right channel and hits a shot that is deflected behind for a corner. 29 min King comes for a cross and, though he gets to it a fraction before Stockton, his unconvincing punch goes behind for a corner. Morecambe work it short and Lewis charges out to block. 25 min It’s so hot at Wembley that the officials have factored in a drinks break. 24 min Demetriou’s flat long throw is headed away by Knight-Percival, but only as far as Labadie, 12 yards out. His snapshot is crucially blocked and the follow up from Sheehan (I think) dribbles through to Letheren. 23 min Stockton’s dangerous low cross from the right just evades Wildig at the near post. 21 min Demetriou varies the Newport throw-ins by hurling the ball to Shephard 25 yards from goal. He has a touch and drills a low shot that is blocked by his teammate Labadie. I think it was going wide anyway. Labdadie was also given offside, though that wouldn’t have mattered had Shephard’s shot gone straight in. 20 min This is becoming a decent game, with lots of precise short passing from both teams. And the occasional long throw from Demetriou, but nobody’s perfect. 18 min Anyone out there? 16 min Morecambe break three-on-three from a Newport corner, only for McAlinden to let the ball run under his feet 25 yards from goal. That was a good chance. Just before that, there was another penalty appeal after a man-and-ball challenge by Knight-Percival on Demetriou. It was a good tackle, though had he made contact a split-second later it would have been a penalty. 15 min Now Morecambe appeal for a penalty when Stockton’s stopping header hits somebody on the hand. I thought it hit his teammate Mendes Gomes; either way, Bobby Madley again says play on. 122 min: Chance for Newport! Another long throw from Demetriou tempts Letheren from his line. But this time the ball swings away from him towards Bennett 10 yards from goal. He gets there first, just before Letheren, and heads just wide of the empty net. He was also punched in the face by Letheren, who was going for the ball but got there a fraction too late and crumped both fists into Bennett’s coupon. Newport’s penalty appeals are ignored and there’s no VAR today. 11 min It’s been a pretty slow start, which is probably down to the heat more than the nerves. 7 min At the other end, Demetriou’s long throw is confidently held by Letheren. That was excellent goalkeeping, decisive and accomplished. 6 min Morecambe look the more spritely team so far, especially Mendes Gomes on the left. 4 min Stockton lifts the ball over the top towards McAlinden, who is beaten to the ball on the edge of the area by King. Good sweeper-keeping. 4 min “Hi Rob,” says Matt Burtz. “It’s also a holiday here in the US and I can think of no better way to spend a Monday morning than watching this match. My literal money is on Morecambe, and personally I don’t know how anyone could root against a team that has a shrimp on their crest (except for Newport fans). And isn’t the right to play Sunderland twice next season incentive enough to win today?” 3 min That free-kick aside, it’s been a watchful start from both teams. 2 min Morecambe try a training-ground free-kick, with Mendes Gomes shooting wide on the turn from 18 yards. 1 min Peep peep! Newport kick off from left to right. They are in amber and black; Morecambe are in red. It’s not such a thrill to hear a few boos as the players take a knee. It’s such a thrill to see fans of both clubs dotted around Wembley. Here we go. The players stroll into the north London sunshine. It looks sweltering, which might make for a slower tempo than usual. May the best team win! One man won’t be at Wembley today, but Christian Mbulu - who died shockingly at the age of 23 a year ago - hasn’t been forgotten. And his manager Michael Flynn “Joss [Labadie] is raring to go. He was probably ready to start the second leg against Forest Green but we wanted to be extra careful because he’s a big player for us. I’m hoping we don’t need Kevin [Ellison] today, but if he comes on and scores the winner, fair play. We’ve got to enjoy it. We’ve had a great season – the staff, the players – and now we want that last push to give those fans something to celebrate.” The pre-match thoughts of Kevin Ellison “It’s not about me - it’s about Newport. I want to get involved but if that doesn’t and we win, I’ll be just as happy. The last time [when he scored against Morecambe] my emotions ran wild, so I don’t know what will happen if I score today. More importantly I just want to be happy at the end of the game.” The pre-match thoughts of Derek Adams “We’ve got a really fit squad now, and John O’Sullivan gets himself onto the bench. He’s been out for a long while. We feel that the players in the starting XI are the ones who can win the game. [Tell us about Kevin Ellison, Derek] It’s all about us - it’s how we play and how we take the game to Newport. We need to continue what we’ve been doing this season - we’re one of the highest scorers in the division and we created more opportunities than any other team. We can defend as well, and we need to do all that today if we are to get the win that everyone at Morecambe wnts. “Before the match I’ll tell the players to take great pride in where they’ve come from and what they’ve done this season. We’ve got the lowest wage bill in the EFL, and that tells you about our team spirit and ability. I want them to enjoy the occasion. But you only enjoy it if you win.” Morecambe (4-2-3-1) Letheren; Cooney, Lavelle, Knight-Percival, Gibson; Songo’o, Diagouraga; McAlinden, Wildig, Mendes Gomes; Stockton. Substitutes: Halstead, Mellor, Davis, Kenyon, Lyons, O’Sullivan, Pringle. Newport County (3-5-2) King; Shephard, Bennett, Demetriou; Lewis, Labadie, Sheehan, Dolan, Haynes; Amond, Collins. Substitutes: Townsend, Farquharson, Ledley, Hartigan, Ellison, Maynard, Taylor. Referee Bobby Madley. It’s another gorgeous day at Wembley, with the temperature pushing 25 degrees. To make things even better, one of the Sky Sports pundits is Championship Manager 01-02 icon Michael Duff. What a pleasure to put a face to a name that gave so many lonely males so much pleasure with his remorseless consistency at right-back. The road to Wembley Morecambe are unchanged from the second leg of their semi-final against Tranmere. The Newport captain Joss Labadie, who has recovered from a grisly knee injury he suffered at Southend earlier this month, replaces Anthony Hartigan in midfield. That’s their only change from the epic semi-final against Forest Green. The Newport substitutes include two men who came off the bench to score in that game: Nicky Maynard and the 42-year-old Morecambe legend Kevin Ellison, who is not a huge fan of his old boss Derek Adams. Hello and welcome to live, minute-by-minute coverage of the League Two play-off final between Morecambe and Newport County at Wembley. This is, gulp, the 1671st and final game of another soul-stirring EFL season, and one way or another it’s going end on a high. By 5pm, at a push 6pm, one of these teams will be in the giddiest of stratospheres: League One. Morecambe have never played in the third tier before; nor have this iteration of Newport County. They were last in the old Division Three in 1986-87, a couple of years before the club went out of business. A reformed team started in the Hellenic League, where they played the likes of Kintbury Rangers and Almondsbury Picksons, and eventually returned to the Football League in 2013 under the late, legendary Justin Edinburgh. Since then they have been ever-present in League Two, though they came heartobliteratingly close to promotion when they lost in controversial circumstances to Tranmere two years ago. They are a different team now. Their manager Michael Flynn used the first lockdown to plan a style overhaul, and this season Newport have brought a bit of tiki-taka to south Wales. At Morecambe, there has been a change of substance. This is only the second time since they became a Football League team in 2007 that they have finished in the top 10. In the last five years their league positions have been 21st, 18th, 22nd (when they avoided relegation to the National League on goal difference), 18th and 22nd. In his first full season, and with precisely £0 to spend on transfer fees, their Scottish manager Derek Adams has done an astonishing job. The play-off final, particularly in the Championship, is usually framed in financial terms. Nobody gives a stuff about money today; this one’s for the glory.

What a day we’ve got for you today! Our show courts kick off with Iga Swiatek, who opens her title defence against Kaja Juvan – and with Jannik Sinner, the brilliant teenager who made the quarters last term, against the canny veteran Pierre-Hugues Herbert. When they’re done, we’ve got a bit of Daniil Medvedev, and later in the afternoon, there’ll be some Roger Federer, along with a frankly ridiculous matchup between last year’s defeated finalist, Sofia Kenin, and Jelena Ostapenko, the 2017 champions. Add to that a a bunch of Muguruza, Cilic, Tiafoe, Mertens, Bencic, Konta, Norrie and Heather Watson – plus Roland Garros’ first-ever night session, featuring Serena Williams – and away we go!</p> <p><strong>Play: 11am local, 10am BST</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-05-31T09:09:17.097Z\">at 10.09am BST</time></p>  </div>","wordcount":"5966","firstPublicationDate":"2021-05-31T09:03:21Z","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2021-05-31T16:44:27Z","liveBloggingNow":"true","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/p/hj5em","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f46d0c0b7c005ef4c3cb3aa8741e8a62d6f2777/567_413_3576_2145/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","isLive":"true","bodyText":"At 40-30, Ostapenko serves long and Kenin steps in with malice aforethought; shonuff, she punishes another weak one that sits up and a double follows. This time, Ostapenko’s first go is decent, but Kenin finds another tremendous return a backhand to the opposite corner, and Ostapenko can only blaze her response wide down the line. That’s four breaks in a row for Kenin, and after a little sit-down she’ll serve for the match. Both players are struggling with their serve now, and Kenin allows her racket to fall when a backhand error hands Ostapenko break point; a belting forehand return, hard into the forehand corner, takes her halfway towards seizing it, and the clean-up forehand hard into the opposite corner does the rest. If Ostapenko can hold next up, she’ll fancy herself to level the match; if she cannot, Kenin will be serving for it immediately afterwards. I meant to note that a little while ago, Bencic, the number 10 seed, sorted Podorodska 0 and 3. She meets Kasatkina or Doi next. Kenin is gorging on Ostapenko’s serve at the moment, a backhand winner – but there’ve been forehand ones too – raising two break points. She only needs one, and is two games away. She might be hurt, but won’t want to halt her own momentum and is doing well enough to keep at it. Ostapenko pushes hard but Kenin finds two colossal second serves to hang in there. The 2017 champ continues hitting though, earning deuce and eventually forcing a forehand error with a cleverly-angled volley. Kenin might’ve hurt herself in the process, but she’s moving ok for now. Kenin 6-4 4-6 3-1 Ostapenko Kenin seizes on a short one, muscling a forehand winner that gives her 15-30. Ostapenko, though, quickly closes with two large forehands, but from 40-30 can’t close out because a second serve sits up nicely enough for Kenin to apply the drop. Kenin, who took a break before this set has grown like she ate a mushroom during it, and when she racks up another break point, comes in to attack a second serve and heaves a backhand winner down the line. This is nearly over now, and that’s a shame because Ostapenko worked so hard to yank herself back into the match. Yeah, we’ve all seen it before. Kenin breaks Ostapenkz immediately – with help – then consolidates quickly. All that diligence, and now look. A meaty forehand from Ostapenko incites Kenin to go long with a backhand, handing her set point ... and another hands her the set! Ostapenko enjoys an elemental geshrei and is playing really well now, as consistent and hitting twice as many winners. This decider should be decent. Kenin 6-4 4-6 Ostapeko I feel like a moron typing this, but Ostapenkz has been really solid this set, and will feel nauseated we’re on serve at 5-4. Kenin, though, is a monstrous competitor, able to keep it ticking when not at her best and that’s why we are where we are. That’s the end of the day session on Chatrier – Serena meets Irina Begu in its debut night affair, and they’ll get going in just under three hours, 9p local time and 8pm BST. He plays Cilic or Rinderknech next – Cilic is a set and a break up – but more generally, he looked beautiful out there and though it’s hard to see him beating the other two, you never know. Kenin hasn’t played a great set here, but tennis being tennis she finds two earth-shattering forehands to yank a break-back out of nowhere and suddenly she’s back in it, bellowing in celebration just as Ostapenko did. Ostapenko has the collapse in her locker, and if Kenin can maintain pressure we might just see one here. Kenin 6-4 3-4 Ostapenko Federer is serving at 4-3 in set three and the commentator notes he’s not even been taken to deuce yet. It’s quite insane how good he is, and quite funny that he’s played in the same era as the greatest clay-courter ever. Laugh! At 40-15, Kenin lands a forehand close to the line, so Ostapenko points it out then heads back to her chair. The umpire, though, has other notions, deciding it clipped the whitewash; Ostapenko detains him in conversation, then thunders down an ace before agitating the crowd once more. Lovely stuff. Ostapenkz is giving Kenin all she can handle in her latest service game, netting a backhand on break point ... and then a forehand on her next one. As ever, she’s got the shots to threaten anyone, but she’s also got the shots to rescue anyone, and there she goes, playing a horrific drop on deuce only for Kenin to scurry in and net! Ostapenkz celebrates right in Kenin’s coupon and when a double fault follows, waves arms to try and wind up herself, her opponent and the crowd, We got ourselves a ball-game! Kenin 6-1 1-3 Ostapenko Back to Chatrier now, where Federer has broken Istomin in set three. He now leads 6-2 6-2 3-2 and this is close to did. Once Cirstea got ahead in the breaker she looked much the better player and the score doesn’t flatter her, nor the booming backhand that clinched victory. She meets Van Uytvanck or Trevisan next. Konta has made Cirstea serve for it, but there’s no reason to think she won’t do so successfully and very quicky it’s 40-0. “Federer is past it,” decides Simon McMahon. “I reckon even I could take a set off him now, in best Terry-Thomas style. Hard cheese, old boy. I have been drinking since early morning, mind.” There’s a slot at which this is helpful, in table tennis at least; probably about three drinks, where you’re loose and seeing it. And then you’re not. Podoroska has not only averted the double-bagel but has broken, so now leads Bencic 2-1 in set two, while Ostapenko battles through a humungous hold in the opening game of her second set. But Kenin looks really solid now, and breaking her might be a problem. It looked likely and it’s happened: Cirstea is hitting too sweetly for Konta, whose game sort of relies on stopping her opponent from doing that, and a double break means that this is nearly over. And in the time it takes me to type that, Cirstea moves to 40-0, finding the line in improbable style and then holding to 15. She’s 5-1 in front in set two and Konta, the number 19 seed, isn’t long for this competition. Belinda Bencic, the number 10 seed, leads Nadia Podoroska 6-0 1-0. is the double-bagel (not beigel) on? Back on Chatrier, Federer has taken the second set and now leads Istomin 6-2 6-4. I think he might have a future, that lad. From 3-1 down, Kenin wins five of six games, and out of nowhere she snaffles the set 6-4. Her ability to find on-court solutions is exceptional, though 19 unforced errors will always help. Ostapenkz has probably played better than Kenin, but a double followed by a weak second serve that sits up and suddenly the American is serving for the set. She’s one of those sneaky players able to do just enough, and though Ostapenkz might unload a succession of winners, you’d expect her to close out from here. It’s not especially surprising to see Cirstea break Konta in the first game of set two but Konta earns herself a chance to have it back at the first time of asking ... so Cirstea clouts a monstrous serve down the T to relieve her of the opportunity. Still, though, Konta isn’t going away and her forehand’s looking decent today, a huge return earning her another break point that her backhand can’t convert before Cirstea clatters a forehand down the line for 2-0. That was a really good game, but you sense that the Romanian has whatever she’ll need. “Jelena Ostapenko, who likes to be called Alona, and Sofia Kenin, who likes to be called Sonya,” says, I think, Jo Durie; I wonder where the changes come from. Anyhow, this is shaping up into a very tight match with Kenin saving another break point in the process of making it 4-4. Cirstea looks the stronger player but Konta is hanging in there, saving her second set point with a monstrous forehand. But the next one is on Cirstea’s serve, and when Konta goes long with a forehand, that’s enough. Konta (5)6-7 Cirstea Cirstea takes a Konta serve early, punching a backhand winner down the line for the first mini-break– Konta quickly tzakes it back – while, on Lenglen, a double and a poor drop hand Kenin her break back and on Chatrier, Federer has broken Istomin early in set two. Konta hangs in there so she and Cirstea will now play a breaker. If Ostapenko were a Premier League footballer, would her nickname be Ostapenkz? The game I expected to be the best of the day is underway between Kenin and Ostapenko. If Ostapenko’s hit everything style works, she can overpower anyone, and she’s in first with the early break to make it 3-1. Federer takes the first set 6-2 and Istomin has nothing for him at the moment. Cirstea is grooved now, breaking Konta back a second time before holding to 30 for 5-4. I’d not be shocked to see her take the set from here. Federer’s only played one of the last five French Opens, and I wonder if he’s at this one just to get ready for Wimbledon, or because there’s been a lot less tennis this year. Either way, he’s looking decent so far, cementing a double-break to leave him 5-2 up on Istomin – who, like Roxette’s pal, has got the look. What a superb match that was and what a superb win that is! After Andreescu won the first set, you wondered if she’d accelerate away, then again when she racked up match point. But Zidansek never lost faith in her forehand, grinding out the win. She meets Brengle next. Hi again. They’re still going like the clappers on court 14, where it’s 7-7 and deuce in the final set, some big forehands from Zidansek saving a break point that Andreescu managed to eke out. Shortly afterwards it’s 8-7, and it’s extremely tense out there. And let me hand back to Daniel for the rest of the afternoon’s action. Federer is on court now, and has received a most warm reception from the crowd. After all, he’s Roger Federer. Konta and Cirstea continue to grind each other’s serves, with the Romanian having a series of break points before Konta finally gets to advantage on deuce. And goes 3-1 up with a serve down the centre of the court. Some actualité. That’s three breaks as Konta goes 2-1 up. The return of service has been great, the serving itself rubbish. Konta is immediately broken back by Cirstea in a nervy exchange of service between the two of them. Konta lands a handy break to love when Cirstea serves like a drain in the opening game. On Philippe-Chatrier, Roger Federer is imminent, and he’ll be taking on Denis Istomin, the Uzbek, on Philippe-Chatrier. Jo Konta is up next, talking of plucky Brits. She says she is happy the tournament is being played in May/June rather than in October, and that her body is in better shape than it has for a while. She reached the semis in 2019, and has lost in the first round every other visit - four. The experienced Sorana Cirstea of Romania is her opponent, and is in form. Medvedev beats Bublik. 6-3 6-3 7-5. He’s served for the match at 6-5 after Bublik coughed up a break. Nice and easy. From our tennis correspondent. Fratangelo lands a slice that catches Norrie out and has chance to break back. Then hooks a backhand out to go to deuce. An enforced error from the Norrie serve takes it to match point. On second serve, Fratangelo rides out a let cord to smash a winner to go back to deuce. The American saves the next match point, too. Then faces another before a double fault returns it to deuce. Then another. This time an ace gets the job done. Three straight sets, but plenty of practice, too. Some fist-pumping from Norrie as he goes 5-2 up. Surely, surely this plucky Brit will be in the next round. Norrie serves the next game out with some comfort, and he’s 4-2 up, closing on a first win for three years at Roland Garros. Incroyable. Quick observation, it’s very loud and distracting in these courts out in the Roland Garros car park, the noise travelling from one court to another. Norrie pushes for the break, but his passing shot fails and Fratangelo booms an ace past him. Then comes another break point, a chance that is passed up, but another presents itself. And Fratangelo whacks his attempted passing shot wide. A break up and cruising to a win? Afternoon, all. You join me as Norrie holds to love to make it 2-2 in that third set. Right, I’m off for some scran; John Brewin will coax you through the next hour. On court seven, Mertens, the number 14 seed, has come from a break down to take the first set against Sanders, while Fratangelo has rediscovered himself, breaking Norrie back and then holding for 2-1. Zidansek is hitting beautifully now, and a booming inside-out forehand is enough to give her the breaker. Andreescu, the number six seed, is in a proper row, and the deciding set should be a jazzer. On court six, Norrie senses Fratengelo weakening – a “check-out point” is what they call the one which gives the Scot a chance to break – so he chases that bit harder to drive it home and now leads 1-0 as well as by two sets to love. If he can consolidate here, he’ll be very close to round two. Andreescu and Zidansek are playing a breaker so I’ve switched over to that from Bublic-Medvedev and it’s Zidansek who leads, 3-1. There seem to be a fair few Slovenians in the crowd because Zidansek has a lot of backing, on which point the ice cream in Ljubljana is some of the finest I’ve ever encountered. And though Fratangelo retrieves the mini-break he soon loses another service point, enough to give Norrie the second set. He now leads 7-5 7-6(5). Medvedev requires four set point to get it done but he now leads Bublik by two sets to love. Bublik is playing ok, but 11 unforced errors is not sustainable in a set against a player of Medvedev’s quality. Meanwhile, Norrie and Fratangelo are playing a breaker in which Norrie leads 5-3, Ruud has levelled his match with Paire at one set all, now leading 5-1 in the third, and Andreescu and Zidansek are at 5-5 in the second, Andreescu having taken the first 7-6. Just when Bublik looks ready to hand over the second set he finds a monster second serve and uses it a springboard to hold; at 6-3 5-3, Medvedev will have to serve for it. I daresay he copes. Just when Norrie looked to have broken the back of Fratangelo, Fratengelo broke back Norrie, who now leads 6-5 (and by one set to love). Medvedev is now up a break in set two against Bublik, and this one looks a formality now. But I’m still interested to see how he moves, and whether he loos capable of doing serious damage on clay. I feared for Watson after she was broken back, and shonuff Diyas outlasted her, the final point a timid smash dumped into the bottom of the net. She played ok, leading in both sets, but couldn’t hold it down at the business ends; Diyas meets Sanders or Bertens next, with Sanders 2-0 ahead in set one. Sinner is pleased to have made it through and talks about how many momentum changes there were in the match. He tried to stay calm, and looks absolutely delighted with himself. Well done young man. That’s Sinner’s first five-set win, and he meets Mager next. He’ll be delighted to have got out of that one – mentally, he is spot-on, surviving a match point in the process of coming back from the brink – but will be concerned that he didn’t move that well and looked second-best most of the time. I’m sure he’ll be better in the next round but forget him for a second - what a tussle that was, and what a performance that was was from Herbert. We’re into this competition now, and I can’t wait to see more. This is great from Sinner, clouting forehands like he’s still playing the first set for 30-0. Herbert looks done for, and as I type that yerman unleashes another to raise three match points. Medvedev has come back from a break down to take the first set against Bublik 6-3. I’m not sure he’s got the chops to trouble the meisters, but I’m interested to see how his clay-court game has developed. Look at Pierre-Hugues Herbert! He rushes through advantage, and Sinner will have to serve for it! Hello! Herbert hammers an ace out wide which takes us back to deuce! Oh dear. Herbert, whose double cost him at the back end of set four, chucks in another at 40-30; Sinner is two points away. Herbert then loops up a tentative one that drops into the tramlines, and after three hours and 27 minutes, Sinner has match point... A thunderous service-game from Sinner leaves Herbert serving to stay in a strange but delightful match, while Norrie now leads Fratengelo but a set and a break. It had to happen. Diyas has broken Watson back for 4-4, and I’d not be surprised to see her close it out from here. Sinner, meanwhile, now leads 4-3 with the break, and if he can rustle up two holds he’ll be into round two. Andreescu has taken the first set against Zidansek, 7-1 in a breaker, while back to the men’s competition, Albot and Delbonnis have swapped 6-2s. What a comeback that is! Johnson plays Monteiro next. Watson is fighting hard in set two against Diyas, 4-3 ahead with the break. Every game is a struggle, but she’s making it work for now. A better game from Herbert, who gets Sinner moving again; Sinner isn’t bringing his racket through at quickly as he usually does, and I’m not sure why. But when he has to, he races in to flick a vicious topspinner cross-court, and that consolidates his break. Sinner 6-1 4-6 (4)6-7 7-5 3-1 Herbert I’m not sure if Tiafoe has hurt himself, but he’s 5-0 down to Johnson in their deciding set, having lost the previous one 6-2, having taken the first two. Oh, and on Chatrier, Bublik has broken Medvedev for 2-0 only to be broken straight back. Meanwhile, Norrie has outlasted Fratengelo to take the first set 7-5. Sinner rushes through a hold and this looks a lot like the end. 2-0 in set five. Has Herbert gone? His level has dropped the last few games and he’s been broken immediately at the start of the final set. I guess the way he plays involves a lot of risk, especially on clay when he’s charging to the net to dispense his doubles-champion volleys, and the margins are now working against him. Around the courts: Bublik and Medvedev are away on Chatrier; Johnson is a break up in the decider against Tiafoe, having lost the first two sets; the mercurial Paire has taken the first set against 15-seeded Ruud; Norrie and Fratengelo are 5-5; and Watson is a break in the second having lost the first to Diyas. Since the start of set two, this match has been on Herbert’s racket – he’s been dictating, even the points he’s not won – but Sinner battles through a hold to 15 to take the fourth set! He’s never won a fifth before, but if he wants to progress, he’s going to have to. Sinner 6-1 4-6 (4)6-7 7-5 Herbert Yes he is! Next game, he forces two break points – I say forces, but Herbert lost a bit of something there, whether confidence, concentration or both – and one loopy forehand winner later, he’s got a chance to serve for 2-2! ...and Sinner battles through deuce to hold. As we were advised earlier, he’s a solid individual. ...but Herbert swishes a backhand well wide. Deuce at 4-5 in set four... Right then! Two blazing winners from Herbert give him match point against Sinner.... Johnson has ceom fro two sets down to take Tiafoe to a decider, while Bianca Andreescu, the number six seed, is on serve at 3-4 against Tamara Zidanšek. Diyas has taken the first set against Watson 6-4; Norrie and Fratengelo are at 3-3. Oh! Herbert’s command of clay and angles isa working beautifully here, and he stretches Sinner into a volley he can’t make for 0-30. Are we watching the end? Well, Sinner goes wide with a forehand to give Herbert three break points and if he can take one he’ll serve for the match. A long rally ensues before Herbert nets, then Sinner tries a lob which Herbert gets alongside, allowing it to drop out ... except it drops in! He was right there! What an error, and what a potential turning point! A service winner then makes deuce - this is gorgeously nervy now – and though Herbert has two more break points, Sinner saves them both! If Herbert wins this set he’ll deserve to, but I’d love a decider. Sinner 6-1 4-6 (4)6-7 4-4 Herbert Next on Chatrier: Bublik v Medvedev [2]. Don’t mind if we do! That second set was a ruckus, particularly it’s final game, which had many many deuces, but the champ is safely through and meets Peterson or Rogers next; Rogers won the first set on a tie-break and is serving to earn a second in the second. Back to the Brits, Dias has broken Watson aback and now leads her 5-4, while Norrie has broken Fratengelo back and they’re at 2-2. More like it from Sinner, who rushes through a love hold which he seals with a dismissive forehand swipe. I fancy him for a break in Herbert’s next service game, and as I type that he’s handed a double then a poor volley. This is a chance, but a ridiculous whip cross-court to break the sideline followed by a composed overhead makes it 30-all, and shortly afterwards it’s 3-2. If Sinner didn’t know before, he knows now: he’ll have to take this, because Herbert won’t hand it over. Norrie, who’s had a bazzer of a spring, is broken by Fratengelo in the first game of the match, while Watson now leads Diyas 4-2. Herbert is absolutely loving it out there, bouncing off to his seat and gesticulating at the crowd as he makes it 2-1 in set four. Sinner needs to find something. Steve Johnson has clawed a set back off Francis Tiafoe; Tiafoe now leads 2-1. Juvan is doing much better in her second set against Switaek; it’s 5-5, following a first-set bagelling. On court six, Cam Norrie is about to get underway against Bjorn Fratangelo, the qualifier. Fratengelo won the boys’ competition in 2011, one of only three Americans so to do – the others are McEnroe in 1977 and Tommy Paul in 2015. In other British news, Watson still has her break and leads Diyas 3-2. Sinner has never won a match in five sets (which is what we were saying about Pablo Andujar until he beat Dominic Thiem yesterday). And there it is! Herbert serves out wide, Sinner nets, and Herbert leads 2-1! What an odd and invigorating set that was, Sinner disappearing, fighting back from 5-2, then sinking at the business end of the breaker! I’ve not a clue what’s coming next, but I can’t wait to enjoy it. Sinner 6-1 4-6 (4)6-7 Herbert At 3-3 in the breaker, Herbert mistimes a forehand, addressing the ball late and on his down-jump, swiping wide. But he immediately redeems the situation when Sinner misses with a forehand, then he does so again! It’s 5-4 Herbert, and if he wins two service points, he’s 2-1 in front! On Chatrier, Swiatek has been broken back by Juvan and now leads 6-0 4-3. Bertens is still trying to get back to where she was before she got injured, but that’s still a great win for Hercog who weathered the storm then rode it out. Sahe plays Siegemund or Garcia next. Back on Lenglen, Herbert has hung on for a breaker, and will fancy himself given his second serve and ability to produce the unexpected. But it’s Sinner who starts well, lashing a forehand winner down the line to hold. He meets Krajinovic or Marterer next; currently, Krajinovic leads by two sets to love. More agita from Bertens, who’s been broken for 5-4 – Hercog will now serve for the match – whole Watson has broken Diyas in the first game of their match. In commentary, they wonder if Sinner has recovered from whatever required him to get the trainer on – apparently he told him he felt strange – but he’s looking himself again now, and Herbert is serving to stay in a third set that was previously in his pocket. On court nine, Heather Watson is just underway – she’s playing Zarina Dias of Kazakhstan, ranked 22 places below her but better on clay. Oooh yeah! An outrageous backhand cross-court – from deep in the corner and almost facing the wrong way – gives Sinner 0-30, and Herbert then dumps a volley! That’s three break-back points ... and a majestic return means Sinner only needs one! From 2-5 he’s now 5-5, and that’s why he’s a superstar. Sinner 6-1 4-6 5-5 Herbert It’s Tan who’ll play Vondrousova next; she’s beaten Cornet 4 and 4. On Chatrier, it’s taken slightly longer in set two but Swiatek has broken again, so leads Juvan 6-0 3-1. Bertens has broken Hercog and will be in round two with two holds ... no she won’t, she’s broken back to 15 immediately; inwardly, her racket winces. Sinner, meanwhile has retrieved one of Herbert’s breaks and looks to be in working order again. Can he save the third set? That Sinner be rusty is not especially surprising, but given how beautifully he played in the first set, the drop-off is very odd. Herbert has improved a lot, but not enough to make someone so technical and tough look as ragged and tentative as he now does. HAVE A LOOK! Herbert earns a point for a double-break and seizes it with a sensational backhand down the line! Sinner is in all sorts here, being directed about the court by a player known better as a doubles champ. Can he respond? Sinner 6-1 4-6 2-5 Herbert That’s a bazzer of a comeback - Kanepi is a nasty first-round draw – and meets Tan or Cornet next. Currently, Tan leads 6-4 5-4. Tiafoe has taken the second set against Johnson to lead 2-0. I’m not sure clay is his surface, but I’d love to see him fulfil his potential; he’s got a lot to do to make that happen. Vondrousova has found herself and no mistake – she now leads Kanepi 5-0 in the decider, while Bertens and Hercog are at 2-2. Herbert’s second serve is working really well for him now, and he consolidates easily enough. If the pair of them keep playing as they are, there’s only one winner, and it’s him. Who expected that? Oh! At 30-40, Sinner finds a terrific second serve ... only for Herbert to find a terrificker return! This is a serious match now, Sinner’s forehand not where it was was and Herbert finding his top level. Can he keep it up? Sinner 6-1 4-6 2-3 Herbert Eeesh! Swiatek has reversed the birthday beats tradition, and punished best-mate Juvan to the tune of a 6-0 first set. She’s looking decent. Herbert is serving really well now and he and Sinner are locked at 2-2 in set three, while Vondrousova has her foot to the floor and leads Kanepi 3-0 in the decicer. Sinner, 2-1 up in set two, has the medical chaps on. They have a little red bottle out - perhaps he needs some Old Spice – and check one of his fingers. But he’s soon back on court, though Herbert seems to have some kind of problem which he takes up with umpire. I predicted more breakers in Querrey-Isner, but the number 31 seed has taken the second set 6-3 in much less time. It’s hard to see Querrey coming back from 2-0 down. Bertens is much happier with life now, and a further break, clinched when Hercog dumps a forehand into the net, seals the second set. The number 16 seed now looks well-placed to stamp on the gas and force her way into round two. Swiatek and Juvan are underway and it’s not taken long for superiority to be asserted, the champ holding and breaking from the get-go. Juvan 0-2 Switaek Excellent from Vondrousova, who consolidates the breaks again her hitting more consistent than that of the powerful but erratic Kanepi. That match is now level at one set all. Bravo Pierre-Hugues Herbert! After getting taken to school in the first set he serves out to take the second and looked pretty good doing it. Sinner 6-1 4-6 Herbert Calvin Betton returns with more on Sinner: “He’s basically emotionless. I asked an Italian coach I know about him and he told me that it’s because he’s from a part of Italy that the Italians don’t really count as Italy. They think it’s more Austria. Everyone from there is very un-Italian. They’re calm, don’t show emotion, are very serious in their ways and demeanour.” That’s really interesting, and the man is now facing Herbert’s serve, 4-5 down in set two; if he can’t find a break, we’re all-square. Tiafoe has taken the breaker against Johnson, while things are hotting up in the women’s competition. Bertens is 4-1 up on Hercog in set two, and Hercog, who won the first 6-1, is vexed about an umpire’s call. Momentum looks to have switched there ... and might be about to do so elsewhere, where Vondrousova has three break points. She takes the third thanks to a double from Kanepi, who now leads 6-4 3-4. Thanks in significant part to a second-serve ace at 30-all, Herbert has consolidated his break to lead Sinner 5-3 in set two. On Chatrier, Iga Swiatek, on her 20th birthday, is coming out to play Kaia Juvan – her best mate. Great stuff. The second set on Lenglen has been much more competitive, and Herbert has just broken Sinner again; can he hold on this time? Isner has taken his breaker against Querrey; I daresay we may see another one or several before that mtch is out. Bertens hasn’t been the best of moods this morning, but she’s just squash-shotted a complete misjudgment that looked like looping into the net. So Hercog stood over it, then watched in horror as it clipped the cord, flipped over and died, handing Bertens three break-points; she takes the second and now leads 2-1 in set two having ceded the first 6-1. Yeah, very funny mate. Sinner has broken Herbert back, of course he has, and it’s not 2-2 in set two, Sinner having won the first 6-1. On court seven, Johnson and Tiafoe are back on serve, while on 14, Isner is up a mini-break against Querrey. Great stuff from Kaia Kanepi, who’s come back from a double-break down to take the first set against Vondrousova, the number 20 seed, 6-4. Hello! Herbert is into this now, and skids into the net to lap a lush backhand drop along the net for his first break of the match! Sinner is under a bit of pressure, so it’ll be good to see how he responds. Meanwhile, Bertens tosses a break point and remonstrates with her racket in the strongest terms. That’ll teach it. Bertens is a in a bind, following her break with a drop; Hercog takes the first set 6-1. Elsewhere, Tiafoe is up 4-3 on Johnson with a break, Vondrousova has lost her other break and trails Kanepi 4-5, while Isner and Querrey are 5-5. Ah man, Sinner is a joke. Finding himself 30-40 down, he hammers down a belting second serve then plays two more tremendous points and that’s got be soul-crushing for Herbert. At 0-5 down to Hercog, Bertens earns a break point, and though the set is almost definitely gone she’ll want to assert herself prior to the next one ... and she does, a gorgeous backhand slice from well behind the line making it 1-5. Wow, Sinner has broken again to take the first set 6-1, and is steaming hot. As if by magic, Calvin returns to qualify his Tsitsipas prediction: “Or Sinner. He’s [redacted] phenomenal. And a killer.” Sinner is now 5-1 in front and purring. Meantime, Calvin Betton, a tennis coach mate of mine reckons Tsitsipas will be the next new major-winner, Tiafoe won’t get there and Auger Aliassime is a worry because though he was a brilliant junior, he’s not improved over the last few years. “His second serve is a major problem,” he says. “He got a golden opportunity that tennis players don’t get, coz of covid: to spend three months working on a specific area of his game with no competition or scrutiny. And it’s no better than it was before.” When I watch Sinner – and Auger Aliassime and Tiafoe – and Tsitsipas and Medvedev – I wonder when they’ll be allowed to win a Slam. It’s impossible to look further than Nadal and Djokovic here, then Djokovic and Federer at Wimbledon. The first group aren[t quite ready but the second pair really are – and yet. Vondrousova, who got to the final in 2019 as a teenager, was up a double break against the veteran Kanepi; Kanepi has retrieved one so is 1-3 down, while Hercog is 3-0 up on Bertens and serving. Sinner is going to be an absolute superstar; he’s just such a natural, and after consolidating his break we see him dash to the net and flip over a winner; at 30-all, Herbert is under pressure again. But Herbert keeps the head and wins two quick points to get on the board, 1-2 and a break down. Sinner has started well, breaking Herbert in the first game; Hercog has done likewise to Bertens, the number 15 seed. FYI: for now, I’m watching Bertens v Hercog, Kanepi v Vondrousova and Sinner v Herbert. But I may check Johnson v Tiafoe. Chatrier, from 11am BST Juvan v Swiatek [8] Bublik v Medvedev [2] Istomin [Q] v Federer [8] (not before 4pm local) Williams S [7] v Begu [not before 9pm local) * Lenglen Sinner [18] v Herbert Siegemund v Garcia Kenin [4] v Ostapenko Tsonga v Nishioka * Mathieu Cornet v Tang Ruud [15] v Paire Cilic v Rinderknech Muguruza [12] v Kostyuk Morning all! What a day we’ve got for you today! Our show courts kick off with Iga Swiatek, who opens her title defence against Kaja Juvan – and with Jannik Sinner, the brilliant teenager who made the quarters last term, against the canny veteran Pierre-Hugues Herbert. When they’re done, we’ve got a bit of Daniil Medvedev, and later in the afternoon, there’ll be some Roger Federer, along with a frankly ridiculous matchup between last year’s defeated finalist, Sofia Kenin, and Jelena Ostapenko, the 2017 champions. Add to that a a bunch of Muguruza, Cilic, Tiafoe, Mertens, Bencic, Konta, Norrie and Heather Watson – plus Roland Garros’ first-ever night session, featuring Serena Williams – and away we go!

From AP: </p> <p>Thailand has been fighting to deal with a virus surge that began in early April in a group of nightclubs in Bangkok and has since spread around the country.</p> <p>The Center for Covid-19 Situation Administration reported a record 5,485 new cases, of which 1,953 were in prisons. Confirmed deaths increased by 19 to bring the total to 1,031 since the pandemic began last year.<br></p> <p>The total number of confirmed cases has now risen to 159,792, of which 82% occurred during the latest surge. Many of the cases are concentrated in prisons, housing for construction workers, factories, slums and low-income housing areas.</p> <p> Officials have in some cases been criticised for allowing companies to isolate and quarantine workers inside factories.</p> <p>Bangkok, which has been a hot spot in the outbreak, reported 1,356 of the cases on Monday. CCSA deputy spokeswoman Apisamai Srirangsan said the capital has 45 clusters to deal with.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Bangkok will slightly ease its lockdown measures starting tomorrow. In addition to reopening parks and botanical gardens, the city will allow limited numbers of visitors to museums, science parks, historical monuments, ancient places and art centres.<br></p> <p>Schools, bars, nightclubs and entertainment venues will remain closed, but tattoo parlours, nail salons, beauty and weight loss clinics, and some massage parlours will be allowed to reopen with restrictions on the number of clients.</p> <p>Thailand had been considered a success story last year for largely containing the virus, though at great economic cost, especially to its tourism sector, because foreign visitors were largely banned from entering the country.</p> <p>So far, about 3.3% of the country’s roughly 69 million people have received at least one vaccine dose. The government has secured only 7 million vaccine doses in total.</p> <p>The government has been negotiating to get more supplies that would allow it to fully inoculate about 70% of the population by the end of the year. Its earlier plans would have allowed only about 45% of the population to be inoculated.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eb7728125c2725aa96cba33c2720fd798293682a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb7728125c2725aa96cba33c2720fd798293682a/0_182_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shopping mall staff wait to receive the Sinovac Covid-19 vaccine at a vaccination centre inside a shopping mall in Bangkok, Thailand, today.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shopping mall staff wait to receive the Sinovac Covid-19 vaccine at a vaccination centre inside a shopping mall in Bangkok, Thailand, today.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Diego Azubel/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-05-31T09:33:58.688Z\">at 10.33am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-60b4a0d88f08d486a77183ac\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-05-31T08:45:07.016Z\">9.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Hong Kong</strong> will offer civil servants who get vaccinated against Covid-19 a day off for each dose, the government said today, as authorities struggle to boost a sluggish innoculation rate among the city’s 7.5 million population. From Reuters:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The secretary for the civil service, Patrick Nip, speaking at a press conference, also said the government was in talks with financial institutions, tertiary schools and theme parks to set up innoculation centres for staff to ramp up the vaccination rate.</p> <p>Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said at the briefing she had already sent letters to more than 100 firms urging them to follow in the footsteps of the government’s measures.</p> <p>“From now until the end of August is a crucial time for pandemic prevention,” Lam said. “We’re kicking off the ‘Early Vaccination for All’ campaign today to boost the vaccination rate, in order to achieve herd immunity.”</p> <p>Health secretary Sophia Chan joined her colleagues’ calls for people to get vaccinated, warning that if another wave of coronavirus sweeps the territory those who have not been innoculated could face more restrictions.</p> <p>More than 2.3 million coronavirus vaccines have been administered in Hong Kong, with the lacklustre rate resulting in a surplus of doses that are due to expire as soon as August.</p> <p>Roughly 21% of the population aged 16 and above has had at least one dose, Lam said. The latest move comes as some businesses have already announced steps to lure a hesitant public, with Sino Group, Ng Teng Fong Charitable Foundation and Chinese Estates Holdings dangling a new flat worth HK$10.8m (£1m) as the top prize in a vaccine lottery.</p> <p>The government has also relaxed some coronavirus rules for vaccinated people in a bid to encourage inoculations as worries over adverse reactions and a lack of confidence in the Chinese-made Sinovac vaccine hamper the vaccination rate.</p> <p>Hong Kong offers both Sinovac and Germany’s BioNTech vaccines and residents can choose.</p> <p>The global financial hub has kept Covid-19 transmission largely under control, recording more than 11,800 cases and 210 deaths, much lower than many other developed cities.</p> <p>While life in Hong Kong has largely returned to normal with schools reopened and restaurants and shopping malls full, the government still limits gatherings outside to no more than four people.</p> <p><a

rate in Bolton currently stands at 386.7 cases per 100,000, down from 452.8 on 21 May, suggesting the recent surge in cases in the town, driven by the spread of the Indian variant of coronavirus, may have peaked.</p> <p>Bolton shares a border with Blackburn with Darwen, and both areas have reported some of the highest numbers of cases of the Indian variant, with Bolton recording 1,354 up to 25 May -– the highest in the country – and Blackburn with Darwen recording 361.</p> <p>Health teams in both local authorities have been running surge testing for the virus, along with <a

for the vaccine.</p> <p>Dr Helen Wall, senior responsible officer for the Covid vaccine programme in Bolton, told BBC Breakfast: </p> <p>“I’m pleased to report that things are starting to slow in terms of the rise here in Covid cases, but we really can’t rest on that.</p> <p>“It’s only been a few days of the rates slowing down so we really are keen to keep pushing forwards and get the rates down further.”</p> <p>Dr Wall said there are very young populations in many of the areas that have seen the highest rises in Bolton, and each time the age comes down for vaccine eligibility, thousands more people are able to come forward for the jab.</p> <p>“I think the age of eligibility going down every few days has really helped, and will really help us, if we can get those people through the doors to be vaccinated asap,” she said.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-05-31T08:21:27.129Z\">at 9.21am BST</time></p>  </div> <div

The government said 700,000 people had been tested through last Wednesday.</p> <p>China had relaxed most restrictions on domestic travel after the ruling Communist Party declared the virus under control last March. Travellers arriving from abroad still must be tested.</p> <p>On Saturday, residents of one Guangzhou neighbourhood were ordered to stay at home for door-to-door testing. In some areas, outdoor markets and child care facilities were closed and in-person grade school classes and indoor restaurant dining cancelled.</p> <p>China reports a handful of new cases every day but says almost all are believed to be people who were infected abroad.

Earlier the government came under fire from some lawmakers for sending contradictory Covid-19 messages ahead of the match, in which Chelsea beat Manchester City 1-0. In the days leading up to Saturday’s final, big crowds of English fans, largely maskless and not socially distancing, took over Porto’s streets to drink and chant team slogans. One further person has died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19 as of Monday, according to the government, bringing the UK total to 127,782. Separate figures published by the Office for National Statistics show there have now been 153,000 deaths registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate. The government also said that as of 9am on Monday there had been a further 3,383 lab-confirmed cases in the UK, PA Media reports. You can read the official release here. Health ministers in Germany have pledged to clamp down on fraud in coronavirus test centres across the country, after evidence that some have been claiming for more tests than they have carried out. At an emergency meeting on Monday after German media exposed the anomalies, Jens Spahn, the federal health minister, and representatives from the 16 states agreed to introduce reforms at the 15,000 test centres. Since March, Germans have been able to have at least one free coronavirus test a week, with some states providing one test a day. The national daily test capacity is about 360,000 a day. Test centres receive €18 (£15) for each test carried out. However, as increasing numbers of test centres sprang up around the country, no system was in place to track the number of tests actually done, compared with the numbers submitted by the centres to the government, for which they are quickly reimbursed. Kate Connolly, the Guardian’s Berlin correspondent, has the full story here: Italy reported 82 coronavirus-related deaths on Monday against 44 the day before, the health ministry said, while the daily tally of new infections fell to 1,820 from 2,949. The number of patients in hospital with Covid- not including those in intensive care- stood at 6,482 on Monday, down from 6,591 a day earlier, Reuters reports. In France, health authorities reported 2,945 people in intensive care units with Covid-19 on Monday, down by 48 from a day earlier, continuing a virtually uninterrupted fall from a 2021 high of more than 6,000 mid-April. The total number of people in hospital also dropped by a further 179 to 16,596 as the vaccination campaign sped up, Reuters reports. The health ministry also reported 126 new coronavirus deaths in hospitals, after three days with a hospital coronavirus death toll below 100. Denmark’s government has asked the country’s health authorities to reconsider a decision earlier this month to exclude Johnson &amp; Johnson’s Covid-19 shots from its vaccination programme, local media reported on Monday, citing unnamed sources. The media reports by broadcaster TV2 and newspaper Ekstra Bladet also said Denmark’s vaccination programme would be concluded in September, two weeks after the current timeline. The delay is due to delivery of fewer Moderna vaccines than expected, they reported. Denmark was the first country to exclude the J&amp;J vaccine over a potential link to a rare but serious form of blood clot. A spokeswoman for the health ministry could not immediately comment on the reports. Denmark has also stopped using the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine altogether, citing similar concerns. Thailand’s government has reversed a decision by authorities in its capital, Bangkok, to ease coronavirus restrictions, as the city battles its worst outbreak of the virus so far, Reuters reports. The Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) late on Monday said the national coronavirus taskforce had overruled the city’s move to allow massage shops, clinics and parks to reopen from Tuesday. It did not provide a reason. Bangkok and the provinces around it are the epicentre of the two-month-old outbreak, during which the vast majority of Thailand’s coronavirus cases and deaths have been recorded. Massage shops, clinics and public parks must remain closed along with schools, cinemas, gyms and zoos for at least 14 more days. The decision comes as the government faces growing public criticism for a slow and chaotic vaccine rollout, which is due to start on 7 June. Thailand reported 5,485 new cases on Monday, with 1,356 of those in Bangkok. The country also reported 19 new deaths on Monday, bringing its total to 1,031 since the outbreak started. Hello!

Your thoughts are always welcome. Email: lucy.campbell@theguardian.com Twitter: @lucy_campbell_ The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) has called for speedily launching global negotiations to agree on an international treaty on pandemic preparedness and response, Reuters reports. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO director general, also told a closing session of its annual week-long ministerial assembly that the UN agency required sustainable and flexible funding. He said: The one recommendation I believe will do the most to strengthen WHO and global health security is the recommendation of a treaty on pandemic preparedness and response which could also strengthen relations between member states and foster cooperation. This is an idea whose time has come. In England, a total of 54,657,957 Covid vaccinations took place between 8 December and 30 May, according to NHS England data, including first and second doses, which is a rise of 278,637 on the previous day. NHS England said 32,938,496 were the first dose of a vaccine, a rise of 99,213 on the previous day, while 21,719,461 were a second dose, an increase of 179,424, PA Media reports. Hungary’s planned vaccine plant will be fitted out for production of Chinese shots against Covid-19 as well as a local dose, foreign minister Péter Szijjártó has said, according to state news agency MTI. Szijjártó made the announcement after talks with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi and added that the agreement would mean a “great strategic advantage” for Hungary, Reuters reports. An advocacy group has sent a legal letter to the government body charged with protecting England’s public health, warning of a high court challenge unless it immediately publishes data of the spread in schools of the variant first detected in India. The pre-action letter sent by advocacy group, the Citizens, working with AWO, a data rights firm, follows a report in the Observer that Public Health England (PHE) was preparing to publish the data on 13 May but the prime minister’s office intervened and put pressure on it not to do so. The legal letter says the public health body is bound by law to be independent from political interference and warns it faces a judicial review unless it releases the data. It cites PHE’s framework agreement with the Department of Health and Social Care that states it has “operational autonomy” and “shall be free to publish and speak on those issues which relate to the nation’s health and wellbeing in order to set out the professional, scientific and objective judgement of the evidence base”. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, and Boris Johnson are both named as “interested parties” in the proposed claim, to which PHE has seven days to respond. Clara Maguire, the executive director of the Citizens, said: ‘It defies belief that Public Health England is refusing to publish this vital public health data on the spread of the so-called Indian variant in schools despite scientists, teachers, parents and unions all saying that they need it to safeguard theirs and their children’s health. “We believe that there is an immediate risk to life. The public needs this data now and we believe that PHE is acting unlawfully in withholding it. It is unbelievable that a matter of vital importance to our public health can be subject to political interference.” The letter states that PHE had promised stakeholders that the data would be included in reports “on or around 12 May” and that PHE by not then publishing was in “breach of a legitimate expectation”. On Thursday, eight unions wrote to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, asking for the release of the same data. Update from earlier post on the European Commission proposing that all EU countries gradually ease travel measures over the summer: People who have recovered from a Covid-19 infection should be exempt from restrictions for 180 days, Reuters reports. The commission also proposed that more reliable, but more expensive PCR tests should be valid for 72 hours and rapid antigen tests for 48 hours. Children, who are not yet in line for vaccinations, should not have to undergo a quarantine if travelling with parents who are exempt. Those aged six and older can be subject to tests. The proposals, which are being put to EU member states, mirror those already agreed for travel to the EU from outside the bloc. Plans to make Covid documents a requirement of entry to mass events are likely to be dropped as the government grapples with how it can safely lift the final set of restrictions in England within weeks. Ministers have been investigating making coronavirus status certificates compulsory in some settings for months, following the lead of Israel, which introduced a “green pass” for people to demonstrate their low-risk of having or transmitting the disease. As the UK’s vaccination programme continues at greater speed than most countries, questions in Whitehall have focused on how best fully to reopen sectors such as theatres and nightclubs, and restart spectator events including festivals and concerts, without social distancing. But the Guardian has been told that status documents, which would display proof of vaccination, a recent negative test result, or antibodies, are unlikely to be introduced ahead of 21 June – the final stage of Boris Johnson’s roadmap out of lockdown when all legal limits on social contact are due to be scrapped. Aubrey Allegretti, a political correspondent for the Guardian, has the full story here: Vietnam is encouraging local governments and companies to import Covid vaccines themselves, the government said, through procurements that would need to be done via the health ministry or through 27 licensed importers. As Reuters reports, the country is grappling with its biggest outbreak so far and has yet to start mass vaccinations. In England, Twickenham Rugby Stadium has been turned into a major walk-in vaccine centre in a drive to try to boost vaccinations against coronavirus as cases of the Indian variant surge. Up to 15,000 first dose jabs are being made available for those in the local area who have not yet been vaccinated, PA Media reports. The event - called Let’s Tackle Covid - aims to increase the number of vaccinations as cases of the Indian coronavirus variant surge in Hounslow, west London. The coronavirus variant of concern first detected in India is continuing to spread across England, with cases emerging beyond “hotspot” areas, data suggests. The variant, known as B.1.617.2, is thought to be driving a rise in Covid cases in parts of the UK and is believed to be both more transmissible than the variant first detected in Kent, which previously dominated, and somewhat more resistant to Covid vaccines, particularly after just one dose. At present up to three-quarters of new Covid cases in the UK are thought to be caused by the India variant. There have also been signs of a slight rise in hospitalisations. The situation has led some scientists to warn that the country is now in the early stages of a third wave of coronavirus which, despite the vaccination programme, modelling suggests could lead to a rise in hospitalisations and deaths, and that full easing of restrictions in England on 21 June should be reconsidered. You can read the latest by Nicola Davis, the Guardian’s science correspondent, here: Vietnam has announced the suspension of incoming international flights to its capital and tightened restrictions in its biggest city, Reuters reports. After successfully containing Covid outbreaks for most of last year, Vietnam is seeing infections rise sharply and has detected several highly transmissible variants, including a new one announced on Saturday that had elements of the variants first identified in Britain and India. The inbound flight suspension to Hanoi will apply from 1 June 1 to 7 June. Vietnam has been restricting inbound international flights since the start of the pandemic. It follows a similar move by the business hub Ho Chi Minh City, which on Monday started 15 days of measures that include bans on dining in restaurants and public gatherings of more than 10 people. It has urged people over 60 to stay indoors (see earlier post). Vietnam, a country of 98 million people, has recorded 7,236 Covid infections so far, one of the world’s lowest caseloads. It has reported 47 deaths overall. Travellers from the UK will have to provide “compelling reasons” to enter France from Monday, as French authorities tighten curbs to halt the spread of the Indian Covid variant. Travel to France from the UK will be permitted only for EU nationals, French residents, or those travelling for essential reasons. Those who are allowed to make the journey must take a pre-departure Covid test and quarantine for seven days on arrival. France is listed as an “amber” destination by the UK government, which advises against travel there, with British authorities requiring people to self-isolate for 10 days and take two Covid tests on their return. Last Wednesday, the French government’s official spokesman, Gabriel Attal, said there was “a new situation with the progression of the so-called Indian variant in the UK”, adding that Germany had already imposed strict controls on visitors from Britain and that France was taking “similar measures”. France has today opened up Covid-19 vaccines to all adults, a week before Germany, as Europe races to avoid another wave of infections caused by new virus variants, AFP reports. Until now, French authorities gave priority to people over 50, people in “priority professions” or younger adults with underlying health problems. So far, 25.4 million people have received a first shot of a vaccine, representing about 38% of the population and nearly one in two adults. Nearly 12 million have received the two shots required for full protection. As the French savour a degree of freedom following the reopening of cafes, restaurants and museums two weeks ago, initially high levels of vaccine scepticism have begun to subside. A Cevipof poll conducted in early May showed that 65% of adults planned to get vaccinated, up from 48% in February. “I am fully convinced that we are going to see a lot of people getting vaccinated,” Prof Alain Fischer, the immunologist who heads the government’s vaccination advisory board, said today, adding that immunisation was the key to “getting back an increasingly normal life.” With 28 million adults eligible for a first shot, but only around half a million appointments available each day, many people have opted to travel outside their neighbourhood or even their region to secure highly coveted Pfizer or Moderna shots. Vaccinations with the AstraZeneca and Janssen jabs are open only to those aged 55, after cases of potentially deadly blood clots in a very small number of younger people vaccinated. The government is hoping that the 76.7m vaccines it is expecting to receive in June will help it meet demand. So far the virus has claimed 109,431 lives in France. Russia’s single-dose Sputnik Light vaccine against Covid-19 has been approved for use in the Palestinian territories, Russia’s RDIF sovereign wealth fund has said. The RDIF fund is marketing the Russian vaccine abroad, Reuters reports. Portugal’s economy shrank 3.3% in the first quarter from the preceding three months, as tourism withered due to a tight lockdown imposed in mid-January, official data indicates. To fight a surge in Covid infections in mid-January, which at the time was the deadliest outbreak per capita in the world, the country imposed a strict three-month lockdown, which has since been gradually lifted. Statistics agency INE said, in its second reading, that gross domestic product shrank 5.4% from the first quarter last year when the country’s first lockdown did not take effect until mid-March. As Reuters reports, Portugal’s economy, in which the tourism sector represented about 15% of GDP before the pandemic hit, shrank 7.6% in 2020, its biggest annual slump since 1936. The European Commission has proposed that all EU countries gradually ease travel measures over the summer, as the number of Covid vaccinations continues to grow and the severity of the pandemic in the bloc diminishes, Reuters reports. The EU executive, which is seeking to harmonise travel measures across the bloc, said that – according to its recommendation – fully vaccinated people should be exempt from testing or quarantines when travelling from one EU country to another. Reuters reports: India’s Serum Institute will increase production of AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccines by nearly 40% in June, officials said on Monday, in the first step towards alleviating a shortage that has worsened the country’s battle with coronavirus. The world’s second most-populous nation has struggled with a catastrophic outbreak of Covid-19 since last month which is only now starting to abate after killing tens of thousands of people. Government officials and experts say the only way India can avoid a third wave of infections is by having most of its 1.3 billion population inoculated. The Serum Institute of India, the world’s biggest manufacturer of vaccines, will make 90 million doses of AstraZeneca in June from about 65 million a month now, a company spokesman told Reuters. Most of the shots administered in India are AstraZeneca, but local firm Bharat Biotech also plans to ramp up production of its Covaxin vaccine to 23 million in June from about 10 million in April, a government official said. Covid curbs may not be eased further next week in parts of Scotland where infections are rising, the health secretary has warned. Areas in level 2 are scheduled to move down to level 1 on 7 June. However, according to Humza Yousaf, this may not be possible for areas where coronavirus cases are giving “cause for concern”. He said this could affect locations outside Glasgow, which is the only part of Scotland that remains in level 3. Speaking to the BBC’s Good Morning Scotland programme, Yousaf said: It may not be the entire country moving to level one. I think people would understand where there are rising case numbers, where there is rising test positivity … it may be the case that parts of the country move to level one but actually other parts of the country we decide to keep in level 2. Asked if he was referring to Glasgow, he replied: “Glasgow – but also, I must be quite frank, there are other parts from the data that continue to give us cause for concern.” This has been shared by Edouard Mathieu, head of data at Our World in Data: The 21 June target for scrapping England’s remaining coronavirus restrictions appears increasingly under threat, as a senior government adviser said the country was in the early stages of a third wave. Prof Ravi Gupta, a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme there had been “exponential growth” in new cases, with the variant first detected in India accounting for three-quarters. Asked if the third wave had begun, Gupta replied: “Yes.” He added: Of course, the numbers of cases are relatively low at the moment – all waves start with low numbers of cases that grumble in the background and then become explosive – so the key here is that what we are seeing here is the signs of an early wave. It will probably take longer than earlier waves to emerge because of the fact that we do have quite high levels of vaccination in the population, so there may be a false sense of security for some time, and that’s our concern.

As always, feel free to get in touch on Twitter if you have any story tips. Thailand today reported a record number of new coronavirus cases as the governor of Bangkok announced an easing of some restrictions in effect for more than a month – including people visiting parks for exercise. From AP: Thailand has been fighting to deal with a virus surge that began in early April in a group of nightclubs in Bangkok and has since spread around the country. The Center for Covid-19 Situation Administration reported a record 5,485 new cases, of which 1,953 were in prisons. Confirmed deaths increased by 19 to bring the total to 1,031 since the pandemic began last year. The total number of confirmed cases has now risen to 159,792, of which 82% occurred during the latest surge. Many of the cases are concentrated in prisons, housing for construction workers, factories, slums and low-income housing areas. Officials have in some cases been criticised for allowing companies to isolate and quarantine workers inside factories. Bangkok, which has been a hot spot in the outbreak, reported 1,356 of the cases on Monday. CCSA deputy spokeswoman Apisamai Srirangsan said the capital has 45 clusters to deal with. Bangkok will slightly ease its lockdown measures starting tomorrow. In addition to reopening parks and botanical gardens, the city will allow limited numbers of visitors to museums, science parks, historical monuments, ancient places and art centres. Schools, bars, nightclubs and entertainment venues will remain closed, but tattoo parlours, nail salons, beauty and weight loss clinics, and some massage parlours will be allowed to reopen with restrictions on the number of clients. Thailand had been considered a success story last year for largely containing the virus, though at great economic cost, especially to its tourism sector, because foreign visitors were largely banned from entering the country. So far, about 3.3% of the country’s roughly 69 million people have received at least one vaccine dose. The government has secured only 7 million vaccine doses in total. The government has been negotiating to get more supplies that would allow it to fully inoculate about 70% of the population by the end of the year. Its earlier plans would have allowed only about 45% of the population to be inoculated. Hong Kong will offer civil servants who get vaccinated against Covid-19 a day off for each dose, the government said today, as authorities struggle to boost a sluggish innoculation rate among the city’s 7.5 million population. From Reuters: The secretary for the civil service, Patrick Nip, speaking at a press conference, also said the government was in talks with financial institutions, tertiary schools and theme parks to set up innoculation centres for staff to ramp up the vaccination rate. Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said at the briefing she had already sent letters to more than 100 firms urging them to follow in the footsteps of the government’s measures. “From now until the end of August is a crucial time for pandemic prevention,” Lam said. “We’re kicking off the ‘Early Vaccination for All’ campaign today to boost the vaccination rate, in order to achieve herd immunity.” Health secretary Sophia Chan joined her colleagues’ calls for people to get vaccinated, warning that if another wave of coronavirus sweeps the territory those who have not been innoculated could face more restrictions. More than 2.3 million coronavirus vaccines have been administered in Hong Kong, with the lacklustre rate resulting in a surplus of doses that are due to expire as soon as August. Roughly 21% of the population aged 16 and above has had at least one dose, Lam said. The latest move comes as some businesses have already announced steps to lure a hesitant public, with Sino Group, Ng Teng Fong Charitable Foundation and Chinese Estates Holdings dangling a new flat worth HK$10.8m (£1m) as the top prize in a vaccine lottery. The government has also relaxed some coronavirus rules for vaccinated people in a bid to encourage inoculations as worries over adverse reactions and a lack of confidence in the Chinese-made Sinovac vaccine hamper the vaccination rate. Hong Kong offers both Sinovac and Germany’s BioNTech vaccines and residents can choose. The global financial hub has kept Covid-19 transmission largely under control, recording more than 11,800 cases and 210 deaths, much lower than many other developed cities. While life in Hong Kong has largely returned to normal with schools reopened and restaurants and shopping malls full, the government still limits gatherings outside to no more than four people. Critics of the rules say they are aimed at preventing a repeat of anti-government street protests that rocked the former British colony in 2019. The rise in Covid-19 cases in Bolton, north-west England, where cases had soared giving it the highest infection rate in the country, is slowing down but there is no room for complacency, a senior doctor has warned (via PA Media). The seven-day rate in Bolton currently stands at 386.7 cases per 100,000, down from 452.8 on 21 May, suggesting the recent surge in cases in the town, driven by the spread of the Indian variant of coronavirus, may have peaked. Bolton shares a border with Blackburn with Darwen, and both areas have reported some of the highest numbers of cases of the Indian variant, with Bolton recording 1,354 up to 25 May -– the highest in the country – and Blackburn with Darwen recording 361. Health teams in both local authorities have been running surge testing for the virus, along with “surge vaccinations” to boost take-up among everyone who is eligible for the vaccine. Dr Helen Wall, senior responsible officer for the Covid vaccine programme in Bolton, told BBC Breakfast: “I’m pleased to report that things are starting to slow in terms of the rise here in Covid cases, but we really can’t rest on that. “It’s only been a few days of the rates slowing down so we really are keen to keep pushing forwards and get the rates down further.” Dr Wall said there are very young populations in many of the areas that have seen the highest rises in Bolton, and each time the age comes down for vaccine eligibility, thousands more people are able to come forward for the jab. “I think the age of eligibility going down every few days has really helped, and will really help us, if we can get those people through the doors to be vaccinated asap,” she said. China today reimposed anti-coronavirus travel controls on its southern province of Guangdong, announcing anyone leaving the populous region must be tested for the virus following a spike in infections that has alarmed authorities, the Associated Press reports. Guangdong, which borders Hong Kong, recorded 20 new confirmed cases, all contracted locally, in the 24 hours through to midnight yesterday. Guangdong’s numbers are low compared with many places in the world, but the rise has rattled Chinese leaders who thought they had the disease under control. People leaving Guangdong by plane, train, bus or private car after 10pm today must present results of a nucleic acid test within the past 72 hours, the provincial government announced. It said testing stations for truck drivers would be set up on major roads. The government of the provincial capital, Guangzhou, a business centre of 15 million people, ordered mass testing after locally acquired infections were found beginning 21 May. The government said 700,000 people had been tested through last Wednesday. China had relaxed most restrictions on domestic travel after the ruling Communist Party declared the virus under control last March. Travellers arriving from abroad still must be tested. On Saturday, residents of one Guangzhou neighbourhood were ordered to stay at home for door-to-door testing. In some areas, outdoor markets and child care facilities were closed and in-person grade school classes and indoor restaurant dining cancelled. China reports a handful of new cases every day but says almost all are believed to be people who were infected abroad. The mainland’s official death toll stands at 4,636 out of 91,099 confirmed cases. Hello, this is Haroon Siddique. I’ll be updating the blog for the next few hours. Burkina Faso, one of several countries in Africa that has yet to launch a Covid-19 vaccination campaign, received its first shipment under the global vaccine-sharing scheme Covax yesterday, Reuters reports, citing the country’s health ministry. The 115,200 AstraZeneca doses were flown into the airport of the capital Ouagadougou and were welcomed by a local delegation led by health minister Charlemagne Ouedraogo. “In a few weeks other vaccines will probably arrive to supplement what we have,” Ouedraogo said. The vaccination campaign, which will first target health workers, aims to eventually inoculate over 15 million of the west African nation’s 21.5 million citizens, the ministry said. Some 1.5bn Covid-19 vaccine doses have been administered globally, but only about 1% of them in Africa, data from the World Health Organization (WHO) found. Earlier in May, Burkina Faso was one of a few African countries, including Tanzania and Chad, highlighted by the International Rescue Committee as not having administered a single dose while richer countries had ordered excess supply. The Covax facility, backed by the WHO and the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (Gavi), aims to secure 2bn vaccine doses for lower-income countries by the end of 2021. That’s it from me, Helen Livingstone, for today. Here’s a summary of what’s been happening: Dr Anthony Fauci, the top infectious diseases expert in the US, has told the Guardian it is too early to declare victory against Covid-19 as cases fall in the country to the lowest rates since last June. “We don’t want to declare victory prematurely because we still have a ways to go,” he said. Japan is considering requiring negative Covid-19 test results or vaccination records from fans attending the Tokyo Olympics, the Yomiuri newspaper has reported, as a poll showed public opposition to the Games remains strong. The acting premier of the Australian state of Victoria, currently enduring a seven-day lockdown, has warned that the situation remains “incredibly serious” as the region posted 11 new cases of Covid, including some involving aged care homes. “I want to be very clear with everyone, this outbreak may well get worse before it gets better,” James Merlino said. India has reported its lowest daily rise in new coronavirus infections since 11 April at 152,734 cases over the past 24 hours, while deaths rose by 3,128. The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, wants the upcoming Group of Seven summit to reach agreement on Covid-19 vaccine passports and to open talks on a “world treaty” to prepare for future pandemics. “We’ve got to do better than this,” he told Canadian broadcaster CBC. In the UK, ministers will adopt a cautious approach in deciding whether to ease lockdown on 21 June, with hospitals already under pressure and health experts warning against “charging ahead”. A health expert affiliated with the World Health Organization has called on the US to share any intelligence it has about the origins of the coronavirus outbreak with the WHO and the scientific community. Vietnam is planning to test all 9 million people in its largest city for the coronavirus and has imposed more restrictions to deal with a growing Covid-19 outbreak. Vietnam is planning to test all 9 million people in its largest city for the coronavirus and has imposed more restrictions to deal with a growing Covid-19 outbreak, the Associated Press reports. People in Ho Chi Minh city are only allowed to leave home for necessary activities and public gatherings of more than 10 people are banned for the next two weeks, the government has announced. The city, Vietnam’s economic hub, also shut down non-essential business on Thursday when cases started to increase. State newspaper Vietnam News said the city authority is planning to test its entire population with a testing capacity of 100,000 samples a day. The newspaper also said police had filed a case on Sunday against a couple who head a Protestant church mission for “spreading dangerous infectious diseases,” citing poor health protocols applied at the premises. At least 145 cases of coronavirus infection have been reported with links to the Revival Ekklesia Mission, a Protestant sect, and the city district of Go Vap, where the church is based, has been locked down. Vietnam has since banned all religious events nationwide. The newspaper said church followers gathered in small space for singing and chanting without proper distancing and mask wearing. Ho Chi Minh city police said the mission has 48 registered members. Here’s an update on Japan’s potential plan to require fans at the Tokyo Olympics to provide proof of vaccination or a negative Covid test from our correspondent Justin McCurry: China has reported a sudden surge of Covid cases in the country’s south, with 20 new local cases on Sunday, Reuters reports, as authorities lock down areas of Guangdong province’s capital city. Of the 27 new coronavirus cases reported by the national health authority in its daily updates, only seven infections were imported, with the remainder originating in Guangdong province. On Saturday, authorities placed a neighbourhood in the capital city of Guangzhou under lockdown as a precautionary measure to curb the virus’ spread. State media reports have suggested that the the recent outbreak is linked to a strain of the virus originating in India. In a Guardian interview, Dr Anthony Fauci, the top infectious diseases expert in the US, has warned it is too early to declare victory against Covid-19 as cases fall in the country to the lowest rates since last June. “We don’t want to declare victory prematurely because we still have a ways to go,” Fauci said. “But the more and more people that can get vaccinated, as a community, the community will be safer and safer.” Daily coronavirus cases have dropped 53% since 1 May, according to Johns Hopkins University data, but the rates are still high in the unvaccinated population and cases are growing globally. Already there have been more global cases in 2021 than in all of 2020, according to Johns Hopkins University data. “As long as there is some degree of activity throughout the world, there’s always a danger of variants emerging and diminishing somewhat the effectiveness of our vaccines,” said Fauci. The Australian state of Victoria, currently enduring a seven-day lockdown, has reported 11 new cases of Covid-19, bringing the current number of active cases in the area to 54. Worryingly, three of those cases are related to aged care homes, which bore the brunt of last year’s outbreak in Victoria, in which hundreds of elderly care home residents died. Acting state premier James Merlino told reporters on Monday the situation was “incredibly serious” and that “the next few days remain critical.” “I want to be very clear with everyone, this outbreak may well get worse before it gets better,” he said. The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, wants the upcoming Group of Seven summit to reach agreement on Covid-19 vaccine passports and to open talks on a “world treaty” to prepare for future pandemics, Reuters reports. “We need to have agreements on issues such as vaccine passports, Covid status certification and the rest,” Johnson told the Canadian public channel CBC. Johnson was speaking ahead of a 11-13 June summit of the G7 economic powers (US, Canada, Japan, Britain, France, Germany and Italy) which he will host in Cornwall, at the southwestern tip of England. “What we need, I think, is a global treaty on pandemic preparedness,” he said, adding that 2020 had been a “terrible year for humanity.” Johnson said it was also a bad time “for believers in global cooperation, because the world simply became balkanized,” with many countries slow to share stocks of protective equipment, medicines and vaccines. “We’ve got to do better than this,” the prime minister added. “Vaccination has got to be a global enterprise,” Johnson said in the interview taped on Friday and broadcast on Sunday. He said it was crucial that developing countries receive vaccine supplies as quickly as possible. Rather than the goal set by some of vaccinating the world by 2024 or 2025, Johnson set a more ambitious target, saying, “We need to get this done by the end of next year.” India has reported its lowest daily rise in new coronavirus infections since 11 April at 152,734 cases over the past 24 hours, while deaths rose by 3,128, according to Reuters. The South Asian nation’s tally of infections now stands at 28 million, while the death toll has reached 329,100, health ministry data shows. And in a slightly lighter twist on Covid news from India, this great picture from Hyderabad shows a man wearing headgear inspired by the virus and who is employed by a private hospital to counsel local residents about Covid safety measures. Japan is considering requiring negative Covid-19 test results or vaccination records from fans attending the Tokyo Olympics, the Yomiuri newspaper has reported according to Reuters, as a new poll showed public opposition to the Games remains strong. With the opening of the Games less than two months away, public confidence has been shaken by a fourth wave of coronavirus infections and a slow vaccination rollout. Foreign spectators have already been banned and game organisers are expected to make a decision next month on whether Japanese fans will be able to attend and, if so, under what conditions. In addition to other coronavirus measures like banning loud cheering and high-fives, the Yomiuri said the government was considering whether spectators should be required to show a negative test result taken within a week of attending an Olympic event. The report was met with outrage among some social media users, with thousands of tweets criticising the country’s continued push to host the Olympics in the middle of a pandemic. The term “negative test certificate” was trending on Twitter in Japan, garnering over 8,000 tweets on Monday morning. In a poll published by the Nikkei paper on Monday, over 60% of respondents were in favour of cancelling or delaying the Games, a result in line with previous polls by other media outlets. Hello and welcome to today’s coverage of the coronavirus pandemic with me, Helen Livingstone. Japan is considering requiring negative test results or vaccination records from fans attending the Tokyo Olympics, the Yomiuri newspaper has reported, as a new poll showed public opposition to the Games remains strong. The UK’s prime minister, Boris Johnson, has told Canadian broadcaster CBC he wants an upcoming Group of Seven summit to reach agreement on Covid-19 vaccine passports and to open talks on a “world treaty” to prepare for future pandemics. And Victoria has confirmed 11 new locally acquired coronavirus cases, including four relating to aged care homes, bringing the total number of active cases in the Australian state, to 54. You can follow our live coverage on the Victorian lockdown here. Here’s a roundup of what’s been happening over the weekend: In the UK, ministers will adopt a cautious approach in deciding whether to ease lockdown on June 21, with hospitals already under pressure and health experts warning against “charging ahead”. Scientists have warned ministers that a third wave of coronavirus may have already begun in Britain, casting doubt on plans in England to lift all lockdown restrictions in three weeks’ time. A health expert affiliated with the World Health Organization has called on the US to share any intelligence it has about the origins of the coronavirus outbreak with the WHO and the scientific community. Authorities in Vietnam have detected a new coronavirus variant that is a combination of the Covid variants first identified in India and the UK and spreads quickly by air, the health minister has said. Egypt will lift restrictions it imposed earlier this month to curb the spread the coronavirus, including early closure of shops and restaurants, from June 1, the cabinet said. South Africa has extended its nightly curfew and limited the number of people at gatherings to slow the spread of Covid-19 as positive cases surge, President Cyril Ramaphosa said on Sunday. Only 1% of the 1.3 billion vaccines injected around the world have been administered in Africa – and that comparative percentage has been declining in recent weeks. It is a stark figure that underlines just how serious a problem global vaccine inequity has become. But the answer for the developing world is not as simple as delivering more vaccines. Italy has extended an entry ban for people coming from India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, as a continued precaution against the more transmissible Indian variant. The ban, which does not apply to Italian citizens, was introduced in late April and was due to expire on Sunday. It was prolonged until 21 June. Kenya has extended its nightly curfew by 60 days to slow the spread of Covid-19, the interior ministry said.","charCount":"42392","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/yohannes-lowe\">Yohannes Lowe</a> (now), <a href=\"profile/lucy-campbell\">Lucy Campbell</a>, <a href=\"profile/haroonsiddique\">Haroon Siddique</a> and <a href=\"profile/helen-livingstone\">Helen Livingstone</a> (earlier)"},{"headline":"John Waddington obituary","trailText":"<strong>Other lives: </strong>Accountant whose passions were classical music and classic cars","byline":"David Waddington","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"715acf0bbb5ce1bf3fe1c78fef278070b585b741\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/715acf0bbb5ce1bf3fe1c78fef278070b585b741/0_165_3732_2240/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Waddington gave his expertise to charities and on retirement started to acquire vintage cars\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Waddington gave his expertise to charities and on retirement started to acquire vintage cars</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: None</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>My brother, John Waddington, who has died aged 83, after contracting Covid-19 in hospital, was a friend to many, a brilliant accountant, supporter of charities, patron of music and a collector of vintage motorcars<em>.</em></p> <p>He was a man who gave much and had many friends from every part of his life.

The only way to return the ball to its initial position would be to follow a path that is associated with a line segment that connects the bottom left corner of the grid to a red dot and does not contain any other red dots.

STEP 2 Below is a full grid of mirror images. Each square represents a table, and the red dots are the corners with no pocket. (Every other intersection has a pocket.) The only way to return the ball to its initial position would be to follow a path that is associated with a line segment that connects the bottom left corner of the grid to a red dot and does not contain any other red dots. However, as both coordinates of a red dot must be even numbers, the midpoint of such a line segment will be a grid point that corresponds to a pocket of the billiard table. Hence, it is not possible to return the ball to its initial position. Nice! I hope you enjoyed this puzzle – I’ll be back in two weeks with a new one. Thanks to Dr Pierre Chardaire, associate professor of computing science at the University of East Anglia, who devised today’s problem. I set a puzzle here every two weeks on a Monday. I’m always on the look-out for great puzzles. If you would like to suggest one, email me. I’m the author of several books of puzzles, most recently the Language Lover’s Puzzle Book. I also give school talks about maths and puzzles (restrictions allowing). If your school is interested please get in touch.","charCount":"2162","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/alexbellos\">Alex Bellos</a>"},{"headline":"NHS staff are reaching the end of their tether","standfirst":"<p>GPs are have been put in an untenable position, expected to provide both unlimited remote advice and face-to-face appointments, writes <strong>Dr Charlotte Bryson</strong>.

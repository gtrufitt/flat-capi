For many experts and environmentalists, the Republican stance is a shockingly retrograde move that flies in the face of efforts to fight global heating and resembles a head in the sand approach to the realities of a changing American economy. In a recent letter sent to John Kerry, Biden’s climate envoy, more than a dozen Republican state treasurers accused the administration of pressuring banks to not lend to coal, oil and gas companies, adding that such a move would “eliminate the fossil fuel industry in our country” in order to appease the US president’s “radical political preferences”. The letter raised the extraordinary possibility of Republican-led states penalizing banks that refuse to fund projects that worsen the climate crisis by pulling assets from them. Riley Moore, treasurer of the coal heartland state of West Virginia, said “undue pressure” was being put on banks by the Biden administration that could end financing of fossil fuels and “devastate West Virginia and put thousands of families out of work”. “If a bank or lending institution says it is going to do something that could cause significant economic harm to our state … then I need to take that into account when I consider what banks we do business with,” Moore, who has assets of about $18bn under his purview, told the Guardian. “If they are going to attack our industries, jobs, economy and way of life, then I am going to fight back.” The shunning of banks in this way would almost certainly face a hefty legal response but the threat is just the latest eye-catching Republican gambit aimed at propping up a fossil fuel industry that will have to be radically pared back if the US is to slash its planet-heating emissions in half this decade, as Biden has vowed. In Louisiana, Republicans have embarked upon a quixotic and probably doomed attempt to make the state a “fossil fuel sanctuary” jurisdiction that does not follow federal pollution rules. In Texas, the Republican governor, Greg Abbott, has instructed his agencies to challenge the “hostile attack” launched by Biden against the state’s oil and gas industries while Republicans in Wyoming have even set up a legal fund to sue other states that refuse to take its coal. The messaging appears to be filtering down to the Republican electorate, with new polling by Yale showing support for clean energy among GOP voters has dropped dramatically over the past 18 months. But critics say Republicans are engaged in a futile attempt to resurrect an economic vision more at home in the 1950s, rather than deal with a contemporary reality where the plummeting cost of wind and solar is propelling record growth in renewables and a cavalcade of countries are striving to cut emissions to net zero and, in the case of some including the UK and Germany, completely eliminate coal. “We are seeing desperate attempts to delay the inevitable, to squeeze one more drop of oil or lump of coal out of the ground before this transition,” said Gernot Wagner, a climate economist at New York University. “They are looking to go back to a prior time, but the trend if absolutely clear.

Large quantities of jobs are set to be created in renewable energy, but some places built upon fossil fuels risk being left behind. Biden has proposed a huge infrastructure plan which would, the president says, help retrain and retool regions of the US long economically dependent upon mining and drilling. The administration has promised a glut of high-paying jobs in expanding the clean energy sector and plugging abandoned oil and gas wells, all while avoiding the current ruinous health impacts of air pollution and conditions like black lung. But unions have expressed wariness over this transition, with Republicans also highly skeptical. The promise to retrain miners is a “patronizing pipe dream of the liberal elites completely devoid from reality”, said Moore, who added that previous promises of renewable energy jobs have not materialized. “And now they are trying to sell us on the same failed idea again.” However the shift to cleaner energy happens, it’s clear the transition is under way – last year renewable energy consumption eclipsed coal for the first time in 130 years and US government projections show renewables’ overall share doubling by the middle of the century. A key question is whether the completion of this switch will be delayed long enough to risk triggering the worst impacts of disastrous global heating. “The Republican response is predictable and pathetic. It is from a very old playbook,” said Judith Enck, who was a regional administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency under Barack Obama. “The party will cling to fossil fuels to the bitter end. It’s so sad because so many Republican voters are damaged by climate change, if you look at deaths from the heat or wildfires we are seeing in California. But the party right now is just completely beholden to the fossil fuel industry.”","charCount":"5821","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/oliver-milman\">Oliver Milman</a>"},{"headline":"UK house price inflation highest since 2014; supply shortages bite – business live","standfirst":"<p>Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial news</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2021/jun/07/china-exports-slow-german-factory-orders-drop-supply-shortages-ftse-pound-house-prices-digital-money-business-live?page=with:block-60bdcdee8f082e80569f89de#block-60bdcdee8f082e80569f89de\">Latest: UK House price growth fastest since 2014</a></li><li>Halifax: Prices could keep rising after stamp duty holiday ends</li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2021/jun/07/china-exports-slow-german-factory-orders-drop-supply-shortages-ftse-pound-house-prices-digital-money-business-live?page=with:block-60bdae968f08b9889b36b359#block-60bdae968f08b9889b36b359\">Introduction: China’s export growth slowed in May</a></li><li>Experts blame chip shortage and Covid-19 outbreaks</li><li>Imports surge, partly due to rising commodity prices</li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2021/jun/07/china-exports-slow-german-factory-orders-drop-supply-shortages-ftse-pound-house-prices-digital-money-business-live?page=with:block-60bdc2c28f082e80569f8961#block-60bdc2c28f082e80569f8961\">German factory orders dipped in April</a></li></ul>","trailText":"Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial news","byline":"Graeme Wearden","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7a8f4022bdc10cc9839a2389d864b4daf62dbce9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a8f4022bdc10cc9839a2389d864b4daf62dbce9/0_330_5100_3061/1000.jpg\" alt=\"View over the village of Skenfrith in Wales, where prices are rising faster than the rest of the UK\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The village of Skenfrith in Wales, where prices are rising faster than the rest of the UK</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Morgan 08/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<div id=\"block-60bddea18f082ac930aecb69\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-07T08:56:45.229Z\">9.56am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-07/u-k-house-prices-grew-at-strongest-in-seven-years-halifax-says?sref=ZVajCYcV\">Here’s Bloomberg’s take</a> on the UK housing boom: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>U.K. house prices grew at their strongest pace in almost seven years as consumers unleashed pent-up savings to gain more space after coronavirus lockdowns, Halifax Building Society said.</p> <p>Prices grew 1.3% in May, driving the annual pace of growth to 9.5%, the mortgage lender said in a statement on Monday.

This is especially the case in the sub-£800k bracket. It might take a few months to see how things pan out from July onwards. It will not be as simple as reducing asking prices, or indeed offers, by £15,000, as the Stamp Duty holiday was about sentiment as much as money and the fundamentals remain strong. </p> <p>“I don’t believe the property market is in a bubble, but it has certainly benefited from Government meddling in the form of the Stamp Duty holiday and mortgage guarantee scheme.

Prices grew 1.3% in May, driving the annual pace of growth to 9.5%, the mortgage lender said in a statement on Monday. That put the average cost of a home at £261,743 ($369,895). The report confirmed findings of Nationwide Building Society, which also showed prices growing at the fastest since 2014. The market is benefitting from a temporary tax-break on property purchases, a buildup in savings by consumers and confidence in recovery from the virus. Covid-19 travel restrictions might also keep house prices hot this summer, reckons Lucy Pendleton, property expert at independent estate agents James Pendleton. The housing market usually takes a breather over the summer months, as some potential buyers head off on holiday. But this year, most popular overseas destinations are the UK’s ‘amber’ or ‘red’ lists (meaning arrivals must quarantine), and France is restricting non-essential travel from the UK altogether. So more people will be at home...and perhaps looking to move house instead. Pendleton says: “The inability of Britons to go on holiday means there’s no distraction now from executing that ambitious move to a larger home. We’re entering a time of year when school holidays and foreign trips normally force the market to drop to a slightly slower pace. “That’s not necessarily going to happen this year and sustained, strong demand over the next few months could have ramifications when the market cools in the autumn, delivering on paper what might look like a more rapid slow down. She also argues that the relatively sluggish figures for London (annual growth of 3.1%) don’t tell the full story. House price growth in the capital is not exceptional as a whole, but it is still being powered by the same race for space that is driving the national market. Many buyers just can’t get what they want within budget after a relatively strong decade of gains. Location has become less important and space more so. UK estate agents predict that the housing market might cool slightly after May’s boom, as the stamp duty freeze is being reduced at the end of the month (from £500k to £250k). Guy Gittins, CEO of Chestertons saw “exceptional transaction volume” in May with three times more buyers than usual, and viewings running at a 5-year high for the past three months. As the Stamp Duty Holiday threshold drops to £250,000 from 30 June to 30 September and then returns back to normal levels from 1 October, we predict new buyer registrations to slightly decrease.” George Franks, co-founder of London-based estate agents, Radstock Property, says the government’s ‘meddling’ has pumped up prices. “May was a month of two halves. The first half was extremely busy as there was still a chance to purchase before the June Stamp Duty deadline. The second half of May and first week of June have been quieter, perhaps due to sunny weather, half term or everyone fleeing to Portugal. More likely, though, it is because there is no urgency as people have resigned themselves to missing the Stamp Duty deadline. “Buyers now appear to be waiting to see what happens to the market after the end of June, possibly in the hope that prices will start to fall. This is especially the case in the sub-£800k bracket. It might take a few months to see how things pan out from July onwards. It will not be as simple as reducing asking prices, or indeed offers, by £15,000, as the Stamp Duty holiday was about sentiment as much as money and the fundamentals remain strong. “I don’t believe the property market is in a bubble, but it has certainly benefited from Government meddling in the form of the Stamp Duty holiday and mortgage guarantee scheme. We’ve effectively had two years rolled into one due to Government intervention. Looking forward, the fundamentals have not changed, namely money is cheap, it’s still cheaper to own than to rent and there is a profound lack of stock.” Jeremy Leaf, north London estate agent, says the market is calming down slightly, but still “very busy on the ground”. We notice too from connected chains that activity is even stronger in areas outside London where affordability is greater. ’Those who have little chance of making the stamp duty deadline are already considering ways of negotiating their way to completing transactions. We expect activity to settle but not drastically change in the next few months.’ The UK housing boom is running particularly hot in Wales, and parts of the North of England. Halifax’s data shows that Wales has seen the biggest surge in house prices, with the average property costing 11.9% more than a year ago. Two other regions have recorded double-digit growth: the North West (+10.6%) and Yorkshire &amp; Humber (+10.2%), outpacing the average annual rise of 9.5% (the fastest since 2014). For Wales and the North West, these are the biggest percentage gains since April 2005, Halifax says, and for Yorkshire &amp; Humber its the biggest jump since June 2006. But the South of England, particularly London, are lagging. Halifax MD Russell Galley explains: This likely reflects a weakness in city prices given the shift in preference for properties with more space, whilst recent surcharges on stamp duty for non-UK residents and Brexit concerns will also have weighed on the capital’s market. UK house prices have risen to a new peak, as the stamp duty holiday and the stampede for larger houses following the pandemic continues to fuel the market. Halifax reports that the average property now costs £261,743, with annual house price inflation at its strongest level in almost seven years (on its index). According to Halifax, the average price rose by 1.3% in May alone, and was 9.5% higher than a year ago. Several factors seem to be driving prices sharply higher, Halifax says. One is the government’s extended freeze on stamp duty payments, which is reduced from £500,000 at the end of June, and ends three months later. Plus, the savings build up by more prosperous families during lockdown; rising demand for homes better suited to home-working; and a shortage of properties on the market. Russell Galley, managing director of Halifax, explains: “Heading into the traditionally busy summer period, market activity continues to be boosted by the government’s stamp duty holiday, with prospective buyers racing to complete purchases in time to benefit from the maximum tax break ahead of June’s deadline, after which there will be a phased return to full rates. For some homebuyers, lockdown restrictions have also resulted in an unexpected build-up of savings, which can now be deployed to fund bigger deposits for bigger properties, potentially pushing property prices even higher. Galley also predicts that prices could keep rising: Whilst these effects will be temporary, the current strength in house prices also points to a deeper and long-lasting change as buyer preferences shift in anticipation of new, post-pandemic lifestyles – as greater demand for larger properties with more space might warrant an increased willingness to spend a higher proportion of income on housing. These trends, coupled with growing confidence in a more rapid recovery in economic activity if restrictions continue to be eased, are likely to support house prices for some time to come, particularly given the continued shortage of properties for sale.” In London, mining stocks are under pressure following the slowdown in China’s exports. Commodities giant Anglo American (-2%), copper producer Antofagasta (-1.5%) and precious metal producer Fresnillo (-1.4%) are the top fallers. Weaker export growth could indicate less demand for raw materials such as iron ore, copper, coal, nickel and zinc. But the wider FTSE 100 is up 0.2%, or 13 points, at 7082 points. UK focused companies are in the risers, including housebuilders, banks such as Barclays (+1.9%), telecoms operator BT (+1.8%) and Royal Mail (+1.8%). Neil Wilson of Markets.com says investors are waiting for US inflation data later this week, for fresh signals as to when America’s Federal Reserve might slow its stimulus programme. The FTSE 100 is the only early riser as European equity markets opened the week broadly in the red as Chinese trade data maybe just weighed a touch with exports lower than forecast despite imports growing at the fastest clip in 10 years. In London, housebuilders led gains while basic resources stocks fell. Asian shares were mixed, US futures are slightly weaker this morning. It’s a light data docket today – all eyes on the inflation data from the US later in the week alongside the upcoming ECB meeting. Last week’s US Non-Farm Payroll report (showing fewer new jobs than expected) seemed to calm inflation worries, Wilson points out: Friday’s jobs report was something Goldilocks-like: not too cold to douse confidence in the economic recovery in the US, but also not so hot as to make the Fed take its feet off the gas too early.... Inflation remains squarely in focus and the largest potential source of investors angst and market volatility this week. April’s CPI print jumped to 4.2%, the highest since 2008. The month-on-month increase in the core reading of 0.9% was the strongest since 1982. Given this, the monthly core reading will be the main focus as it will offer a guide on just how transitory or otherwise the pop in inflation is likely to be. European stock markets have begun the new week in the red. The pan-European Stoxx 600 has dropped by 0.3%, away from last week’s record high. Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC are both down almost 0.4%. In Frankfurt, chipmaker Infineon Technologies (-1.3%) and chemicals firm Linde (-1.3%) are among the fallers, along with takeaway operator Delivery Hero (-2%) and energy firms RWE (-1.1%) and Siemens Energy (-1.6%). The bad news for manufacturers, and consumers, is that the global shortage of semiconductors won’t end soon. Singapore’s Flex, one of the world’s largest electronics contract manufacturers, has warned that it will take at least a year for supplies to catch up with demand, the Financial Times reports this morning. That would mean more delays and disruption for industries around the world, such as carmakers and technology manufacturers. And it’s likely to result in higher prices, with factories already reporting that input costs are rising extremely rapidly this year. The FT says: A rapid rebound in vehicle sales combined with a lockdown-driven boom in games consoles, laptops and televisions has left the world’s chipmakers overwhelmed by the sharp increase in demand. Singapore-based Flex has more than 100 sites in 30 countries and manufactures devices and electronics for companies including Ford, British household appliances designer Dyson, UK online grocer Ocado and US computer and printer maker HP. Its position in the supply chain makes it a large buyer of chips. Lynn Torrel, Flex’s chief procurement and supply chain officer, said that the manufacturers it relies on for semiconductors have pushed back their forecasts for when the shortage will end. “With such strong demand, the expectation is mid to late-2022 depending on the commodity. Some are expecting [shortages to continue] into 2023,” she said. The German factory orders report also shows that real turnover in manufacturing fell by 2.6% in April, compared with March. That could be another sign that supply shortages are hampering the sector, as Germany tries to return to growth after suffering a 1.8% contraction in the first quarter of 2021. Oliver Rakau of Oxford Economics tweets that bottlenecks appear to be hurting German industry: German factories have reported a drop in orders - another sign that supply shortages are causing ructions. New manufacturing orders at Europe’s largest economy dropped by 0.2% month-on-month - missing forecasts of a 1% gain (according to a Reuters poll). The weakness was driven by a drop in domestic orders, which fell by 4.3%, while overseas orders rose by 2.7% month-on-month, the Economy Ministry reported. Orders for intermediate goods (products designed to be used in a finished item) fell 1.0%, while capital goods inched by by 0.2% and new orders for consumer products rose by 1.4%. Bloomberg says it’s a sign that supply shortages and higher prices are undercutting Germany’s economic recovery, adding: Manufacturing has been a stronghold in Europe’s largest economy over the past months, benefiting from earlier recoveries in places such as China and the U.S. Lately though, businesses have run into unprecedented supply-chain issues amid shortages of parts and raw materials. Reuters also highlights how China’s export growth may have been hit by disruption at some major ports: “Exports surprised a bit on the downside, maybe due to the COVID cases in Guangdong province which slowed down the turnover in Shenzhen and Guangzhou ports,” said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, adding that turnover at ports in Guangdong will likely remain slow in June. Major shipping companies warned clients of worsening congestion at Shenzhen’s Yantian port in Guangdong province after the discovery of several cases among port staff. On the ground in Guangdong, factories have yet to report widespread capacity cuts over the outbreak but admitted efficiency issues as they tried to meet overseas demand. Chen Linsheng, COO at Anlan, a Shenzhen-based manufacturer of skincare and beauty-care devices, told Reuters while there was no impact on production, staff are now subject to a series of COVID tests and not allowed back into the factory without a negative result. “We are not allowed going out (of the city). We need to report in advance and cannot even go to Guangzhou or Foshan on our own,” said Chen, adding that a lot of meetings have moved back online. More here: China’s imports grow at fastest pace in decade as materials prices surge Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The global chip shortage, rising raw material costs and creaking supply chains are all weighing on the global economy as it tries to recover from the shock of the Covid-19 pandemic. And new trade data from China suggests these factors are now biting into growth. China’s exports slowed in May, growing by 27.9% year-on-year, down from 32.3% in April. That’s weaker than economists had expected. It suggests the sharp recovery from the pandemic may be slowing -- due to ongoing Covid-19 disruption, and deepening problems getting hold of semiconductors. Imports surged by 51.1% in May - the fastest jump in a decade. But that growth in import values was fueled by surging commodity prices in the scramble for metals and fuel, which is creating concerns about rising inflation. Iris Pang of ING says China’s car industry was hurt by the shortage of semiconductors: The main reason for the shortfall is that all export items related to semiconductor chips have slowed. Auto processing products and parts, the biggest export item, fell 4%YoY in terms of export value. This is most likely the result of the semiconductor chip shortage. Pang also points out that recent Covid-19 outbreaks are also hitting trade. which could drive up consumer prices in the shops. Since the end of May, there have been around 10 Covid cases daily in Guangdong, where most electronics factories are located. Shipments from the port in Shenzhen that process most of the electronic throughput have been affected by Covid. Port workers now have to have Covid tests and port operations have been disrupted. Some factories in Guangdong were also affected by Covid, mostly caused by workers queuing up for testing. As such we expect June trade and production data will be affected. This could push up prices of electronic goods in general and affect China’s export prices and eventually import prices in the US and Europe. Supply chains in Asia will also likely be disrupted. More here: China: Exports slow but imports jump Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, said while import prices increased at a rapid pace, import volumes probably edged down in May. “Once again, supply constraints are partly to blame – inbound shipments of semiconductors continued to drop back. So too did imports of industrial metals.” Commodity prices have dipped following the data, with traders anticipating that future demand may be slower than expected Also coming up today Experts are digesting the deal on a minimum global corporation tax rate of 15%, agreed by leading finance ministers on Saturday. The G7 also agreed that countries should have the right to tax the largest, most profitable multinationals’ profit in the locations where it is generated, a landmark moment. But Amazon could escape paying this clampdown on the “largest and most profitable multinational enterprises”, due to its low profit margins. Richard Murphy, visiting professor of accounting at the Sheffield University management school, said the 10% profits threshold was “inappropriate” because of different business models for different companies. He added that current approaches to reporting profits in each country were “easily gamed”. “This could turn out to be a false hope unless they get the detail right.” Mortgage lender Halifax’s latest house price index is expected to confirm that prices have surged around 10% in the last year.

Reuters say that official figures there report there have been 9,429 new coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours, alongside a further 330 deaths. Russia’s figures have tended to be between 7,000 and 9,500 new cases every day for months now. Andrew Sparrow is back in the UK live blog hot seat today, and he’s just launched it, leading on the row over international aid cuts. He’ll be carrying Covid news there as well. I’ll be continuing here with the leading coronavirus news from around the world. Uganda’s president Yoweri Museveni further toughened virus curbs on Sunday night, including ordering the closure of schools, to stem a worrying rise in local transmissions. Schools will be closed from Monday for six weeks and most gatherings, save for weddings and funerals in small groups, were banned. Non-essential travel between districts was suspended and a 9pm to 4am curfew will remain in force until mid-July. Most shops and markets remain open, provided they comply with government health regulations, but bars remain closed. Uganda had kept its Covid-19 cases relatively low and was spared the worst of the pandemic after adopting one of Africa’s tightest lockdowns, but it eased the measures as cases dropped. However, infections have soared in recent weeks with a sharp increase in severe cases. Hospitals have been overwhelmed as all intensive care and high dependency beds are occupied, threatening to collapse the fragile healthcare system. “In this wave, the intensity of severe and critically ill Covid-19 patients, and deaths is higher than what we experienced in the first wave of the pandemic,” Museveni said in a televised address. AFP reports that Museveni explained that the east African country had recorded as many severe and critical cases of Covid-19 in a fortnight as it did in a three to four month period during the first wave. “We are concerned that this will exhaust available bed space and oxygen supply in hospitals, unless we constitute urgent public health measures,” said Museveni. The country has counted 52,935 cases of coronavirus, of which 383 have been fatal, figures believed to be undercounted as a result of low testing. The Philippines will open up its vaccination drive this week to include around 35 million people working outside their homes, such as public transport staff, in a bid to help curb Covid-19 transmission and to open up the economy, officials said. The next phase in the rollout that started in March comes after vaccines were initially targeted at health care workers, senior citizens and people with existing health conditions. Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said those eligible to join the new phase, which includes workers in the informal sector, will be able to register from Wednesday, with the country expecting more vaccines to arrive in the second half. Neil Jerome Morales reports for Reuters that the Philippines has so far received more than nine million doses, mostly supplied by China’s Sinovac Biotech, but has a long way to go to meet its goal of immunising 70 million people this year out of a population of 110 million. In order to help shore up confidence in the vaccine programme and tackle vaccine hesitancy, local celebrities were among 50 people vaccinated in an inoculation ceremony on Monday. The Philippines, which is battling one of the worst Covid-19 outbreaks in Asia, has reported 1.27 million infections and almost 22,000 deaths, with some provinces outside the capital region emerging as new hotspots for Covid-19. Taiwan has extended its level 3 restrictions until the end of the month, as it continues to report hundreds of daily new cases, including outbreaks in aged care and among migrant worker dormitories. The central epidemic command centre (CECC) has just announced 211 new cases - a drop on previous days but with a warning that testing numbers may have been lower over the weekend. An additional 26 deaths were reported. In good news, there were no new cases announced from backlogged test results, an issue that has plagued health authorities trying to analyse trends in recent weeks. Most of the new cases were in New Taipei City, with 82 recorded, plus 60 in the capital Taipei and 45 in Miaoli, where outbreaks among factory workers are causing concern, and prompting criticism of the government for failing to protect migrant worker communities – known to be a vulnerable cohort of people, after mass outbreaks in dormitories overseas during the past year. Health minister Chen Shi-chung announced new measures for when a migrant worker is found to be positive, including quarantining all close contacts. He said the labour ministry had begun inspecting the more than 1,000 dorms with more than 50 people, and was in contact with workers in need of support. He urged workers to take advantage of multilingual information apps. There are 64 aged care facilities with recorded cases, including 48 employees and more than 146 others, including residents. Chen said Moderna vaccines will start being distributed in Wednesday, prioritising vulnerable groups for a set period of time before widening the eligibility, as opposed to waiting until everyone in that group is vaccinated. A day after US senators flew to Taipei to announced a donation of 750,000 vaccines, Chen seems to be speaking very optimistically about Taiwan’s vaccination drive, which has so far reached about 3% of the population. The island has received just a few million doses, and has orders for tens of millions more, but that is reliant on the production of domestic vaccines still in trial stage and the clearance of global shortages. At the press conference he has even suggested that people may even be allowed to choose which vaccine they want if there’s enough supply in the future, according to local reporters. Senegal could begin producing Covid-19 vaccines next year under an agreement with Belgian biotech group Univercells aimed at boosting Africa’s drug-manufacturing ambitions, a source involved in funding the project told Reuters. African nations are still struggling to acquire shots. On a continent of 1.3 billion, only about 7 million people have been fully vaccinated. Univercells chief investment officer Kate Antrobus, when asked about the timeframe for the project, confirmed that it could send vaccine doses to Senegal early next year. She declined to comment on the exact date for a full vaccine production line in Senegal but of the timelines referenced she said: “I do not think they are unreasonable.” It is not clear yet what vaccine will be supplied to Senegal, but Antrobus said the site in Belgium would be able to manufacture a class of so-called viral vector Covid-19 vaccine such as those developed by Johnson &amp; Johnson, AstraZeneca, Russia’s Sputnik V and China’s Cansino. “If Covid amazingly subsides over the next year … that same capacity could be used for other viruses,” Antrobus said. Univercells also has its own Covid-19 vaccine candidate, being developed with Germany’s Leukocare and Italian firm ReiThera, which has completed phase 2 trials. It is seeking financing to carry out phase 3, which the Italian government said it is ready to fund. Talking of Sky News, former British prime minister Gordon Brown has been on this morning, urging G7 countries to come together and provide a vaccine supply for poorer nations over and above the “scratching the surface” he said was being done right now We’re not safe until everybody’s safe. It’s an act of self-interest. It’s not just an act of charity, because if the disease spreads and mutates and comes back into our country, then we all suffer, so this is something that the world has got to do together. And that’s why on Friday, when Boris Johnson meets the G7 in Cornwall, with the richest countries sitting around the table, they’ve got the chance to make a decision that will vaccinate the whole world by putting up the money that is necessary to pay for it and sharing the doses. Challenged that there were already commitments to share 100m vaccine doses from the UK, Brown retorted: That’s not a plan. You’ve got to have a plan to underwrite the funding, then you’ve got to get the manufacturing capacity ramped up, then you’ve got to get it in a number of different continents, and then you can vaccinate the world. It needs a plan, not just a wing and a prayer. If you are in the UK then there’s a familiar face back on your screens this morning – Sky News presenter Kay Burley has returned to work after being suspended for six months for breaking Covid-19 rules. Alex Green, PA Media’s entertainment reporter, reminds us that Burley was suspended from the channel in December after making “a big mistake” and “pulling” her colleagues into breaking coronavirus restrictions while celebrating her 60th birthday at a restaurant in London, which was then under tier 2 restrictions. Following an internal review in December, Sky News found that “a small number of Sky News staff attended a social event in London” where Covid-19 guidelines were breached. It said: “All those involved regret the incident and have apologised. Everyone at Sky News is expected to comply with the rules and the company takes breaches like this very seriously indeed.” The channel’s political editor, Beth Rigby, and correspondent Inzamam Rashid were also both taken off air for three months following the review. The Washington Post is leading at the moment with an overnight story that “the last mile” of the vaccination programme in the US is proving to be the hardest. They report: Plummeting vaccination rates have turned what officials hoped would be the “last mile” of the coronavirus immunization campaign into a marathon, threatening President Biden’s goal of getting shots to at least 70 percent of adults by July 4. The United States is averaging fewer than 1 million shots per day, a decline of more than two-thirds from the peak of 3.4 million in April, according to The Washington Post’s seven-day analysis, even though all adults and children over age 12 are now eligible. Small armies of health workers and volunteers often outnumber the people showing up to get shots at clinics around the country. The slowdown is national – with every state down at least two-thirds from its peak – and particularly felt across the South and Midwest. Twelve states, including Utah, Oklahoma, Montana, the Dakotas and West Virginia, have seen vaccinations fall below 15 daily shots per 10,000 residents; Alabama had just four people per 10,000 residents get vaccinated last week. Read more here: Washington Post – Vaccination rates fall off, imperiling Biden’s July Fourth goal The urban Indian population are getting Covid-19 shots much faster than the hundreds of millions of people living in the countryside, government data shows, reflecting rising inequity in the nation’s immunisation drive. In 114 of India’s least developed districts – collectively home to about 176 million people – authorities have administered just 23 million doses in total. That’s the same number of doses as have been administered across nine major cities – New Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Pune, Thane and Nagpur – which combined have half the population of the least developed districts. Reuters notes that the disparity was even stronger last month, after the government allowed private sales of vaccines for adults aged under 45 years, an offer which favoured residents of cities with larger private hospital networks. For the first four weeks of May, those nine cities gave 16% more doses than the combined rural districts, data from the government’s Co-WIN vaccination portal shows. “My friends from the city were vaccinated at private hospitals,” said Atul Pawar, a 38-year-old farmer from Satara, a rural western district of Maharashtra, India’s wealthiest state. “I am ready to pay, but doses are not available and district borders are sealed because of the lockdown.” The ministry of health and family welfare said in a statement at the weekend that reports of vaccine inequity in India were “inaccurate and speculative in nature”. “Liberalised pricing and accelerated national Covid-19 vaccination strategy ensures vaccine equity,” it said, adding that smaller cities were also getting doses like the big ones. India has administered more than 222m doses since starting its campaign in mid-January – only China and the US have administered more – but it has given the required two doses to less than 5% of its 950 million adults. Rural India is home to more than two-thirds of the country’s 1.35 billion people. While urban areas account for a disproportionately large share of the confirmed Covid-19 cases, those concerned about the spread of the virus in the countryside say statistics undercount cases in villages, where testing is less comprehensive. Police in Malaysia are using drones to detect people with high temperatures in public spaces as part of Covid prevention measures, according to local media. The drones, which can detect people’s temperatures as high as 20 metres above ground, emit a red light to alert the authorities if someone has a high reading, Bernama, Malaysia’s state news agency, reported. Malaysia entered a near total national lockdown last week in an attempt to halt rising daily infections, which had reached more than 9,000 by the end of May. Though daily cases have since fallen, the health director general, Noor Hisham Abdullah, has warned that the majority of new infections and deaths were from unknown contacts. “One of the reasons is the emergence of new variants in the community which have higher infectivity and mortality rates,” he said in a statement on Monday, urging people to stay home. Malaysian police have previously warned they will use drones to enforce earlier travel restrictions, with officers in some areas also stating they would carry out surprise home visits to ensure people were following rules.

Reuters report that officials recorded 2,419 new Covid-19 cases and 33 deaths on Monday, bringing the total to 179,886 and 1,269 fatalities. The third wave has accounted for more than 80% of total infections so far. The government aims to administer 6 million doses of locally-made AstraZeneca and imported Sinovac vaccines this month, hoping to assuage worries about the slow roll-out and supply shortages. “The government will ensure that everyone is vaccinated,” prime minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said in televised comments after he visited an inoculation centre in Bangkok. The government plans to vaccinate 70% of Thailand’s population of more than 66 million people by the end of the year. So far, 2.8 million people deemed most vulnerable, including frontline health and transport workers, have received a first dose. But the government has come under fire from opposition politicians who accuse it of complacency and an over-reliance on the locally-made AstraZeneca doses. Good morning, it is Martin Belam here taking over the live blog in London. A US public health expert has warned that though cases of Covid-19 are at their lowest rates for months and much of the country is returning to normal life, young Americans are still “a vulnerable host” for the coronavirus. Dr Richina Bicette, associate medical director at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, told CNN children were now accounting for nearly 25% of US cases. “As adults get vaccinated and become more protected and immune,” she said, “the virus is still in the community looking for a vulnerable host and pediatric patients fit that description.” Children aged 12 and above are eligible to receive the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, one of three in US use. Federal authorities will this week debate extending vaccines to children aged 11 and under. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data shows that 52% of the US population over the age of 12 has had at least one vaccine dose and 42% is fully protected. The Biden administration wants 70% of US adults to have received at least one shot by 4 July. Deaths in the US have slowed drastically, the toll a little under 590,000. But with virus variants causing problems as other countries reopen, experts have voiced concern over slowing rates of vaccination, particularly in Republican states. Reuters: India reported 114,460 new coronavirus infections on Sunday, the lowest in two months, while the death toll increased by 2,677, as parts of the country prepared to ease restrictions on movement. New Delhi and other cities are working towards allowing more businesses to operate and movement rules to be relaxed from Monday. The western state of Maharashtra, which is India’s richest and has suffered the most infections during the second wave, plans to start easing in stages a strict lockdown imposed in April. Taiwan authorities have extended level three restrictions until the end of June. The restrictions, which have closed schools, all entertainment, public and sporting venues, and limited personal gatherings, were due to expire next week but authorities have pre-emptively extended them. After living largely Covid-free, Taiwan is experiencing its worst outbreak of the pandemic, with about 11,000 total cases and more than 260 deaths – more than 90% of them since mid-April. In a statement, Taiwan’s cabinet said the outbreak “has not yet stabilised”, and they would release more details of the extension later today. First announced on 19 May, the restrictions appear to have prevented an explosion in case numbers but have not led to a decline. Daily new cases remain in the hundreds, amid concerns over the continued lack of widespread working from home, and worsening outbreaks among employees at three factories, predominately among migrant workers who mostly live in crowded dormitories. Spain is reopening its borders to vaccinated international travellers today, hoping to revive its tourism sector which – like everywhere in the world – has struggled severely during the pandemic. It will also allow cruise ships into its ports from today. The country’s health minister, Carolina Daria, said Spain was “in the process of reclaiming its global leadership in tourism”. “Spain is a safe destination,” she said. Previously Spain allowed European visitors who have a negative PCR test taken within the previous 72 hours, but from today those visitors can take a cheaper antigen test. The three biggest tourist contingents to Spain after from the UK, France and Germany, but in a potential blow to the reopening the British government has not yet removed Spain from its list of at-risk countries, meaning any holidayers will have to quarantine when they get home. According to AFP, Spain’s Malaga airport is expecting about 20 different flights on Monday morning alone, from places around Europe such as Berlin, Lille, Frankfurt and London. Hello and welcome to today’s rolling coverage of the pandemic. Here’s a quick look at developments from the last day. China has enacted mass testing and travel restrictions in Shenzhen over new cases there, while nearby Guangzhou continues to battle the country’s first outbreak of the Delta variant, first detected in India. Taiwan has extended its level 3 restrictions until the end of June, as it continues to report hundreds of new daily cases. The US has announced 750,000 vaccines will be donated to Taiwan. The UK recorded 5,341 cases on Sunday, an increase of 2,101 on last Sunday when 3,111 cases were reported. Portugal’s prime minister has criticised Britain for removing the country from the green list, allowing travellers to visit Portugal without quarantine on return. UK ministers are ‘absolutely open’ to delaying the 21 June reopening date in England if the Delta variant worsens, the health secretary said. Sunday is the first day for 12-16-year-olds in Israel to get vaccinated, after 55% of the population have so far received two doses in the country. Morocco will reopen its airports to international traffic starting from 15 June to help the return of its nationals living abroad Staff of a senate committee investigating the handling of the pandemic in Brazil have said that the Copa America football tournament should not be held amid the world’s second-deadliest outbreak and must be postponed. Uganda’s president, Yoweri Museveni, re-imposed a strict lockdown that included the closure of schools and the suspension of inter-district travel. Victorians in Australia are being warned there is no ‘magic number’ of the people getting vaccinated before future lockdowns can be avoided.","charCount":"20890","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a> (now) and <a href=\"profile/helen-davidson\">Helen Davidson</a> (earlier)"},{"headline":"How are Tory rebels plotting to defeat foreign aid cuts?","standfirst":"<p>PM could face first Commons defeat on Monday as dozens of MPs seek to overturn policy</p>","trailText":"PM could face first Commons defeat on Monday as dozens of MPs seek to overturn policy","byline":"Peter Walker Political correspondent","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f15ea31291eb53871c703668f3b6393a5f132ada\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f15ea31291eb53871c703668f3b6393a5f132ada/1179_656_4083_2450/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Theresa May.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theresa May is a signatory, and every other living ex-prime minister – John Major, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and David Cameron – also oppose the aid cut.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Taylor/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Boris Johnson could face his first <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/jun/02/boris-johnson-risks-shock-defeat-over-devastating-foreign-aid-cuts\">Commons defeat</a> on Monday since the Tories won an 80-seat majority in 2019, as dozens of Conservative MPs threaten to rebel over cuts to overseas aid.</p> <h2>What is the rebellion about?</h2> <p>It follows the announcement last year that the amount of money spent on overseas aid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/jun/03/a-hammer-blow-how-uk-overseas-aid-cuts-affect-the-worlds-most-vulnerable\">would be cut </a>from 0.7% of gross national income to 0.5%, amounting to a reduction of about £4bn.

He said this was because his parents’ home had been burned down by a group linked to the government, and that they had only targeted his family after first trying to find him. In his judgment, justice Geoffrey Flick found the Iraqi man had been “unlawfully deprived of his liberty and should have been released” from detention “soon after March 2019 or (at the very latest) by no later than mid-2019”. Following MZZHL’s withdrawal of his request to return to Iraq, the purpose of his detention was still to remove him from Australia. However the federal court heard the commonwealth conceded it did not take steps to inquire with Iraqi authorities whether they would be prepared to receive an “involuntary removal” – which it was required to do under the migration act. Flick noted evidence from Department of Home Affairs officials that the department did not engage Iraq about involuntary removal of citizens, or on any issues at all, due to “significant political instability” related to the downfall of the Islamic State, sectarian issues, and the fact the “Iraqi government was perceived as regularly on the brink of collapse”. However Flick said these difficulties engaging Iraq did not explain why the department did not take steps “to secure the removal of the applicant to some other country or even to secure his release from detention by the grant of some form of visa.” In January 2020, detention officials received video of the man’s family’s house burning down. However it was only on 4 May this year, the day the court hearing began, that MZZHL was released from detention and granted a departure bridging visa and a humanitarian stay visa. Flick’s judgment was damning of the fact that a departmental submission about the case in January this year “did not place before the minister any material or any analysis as to whether the continued detention of the applicant was lawful or any analysis of the ‘purpose’ being pursued.” “Had the minister for immigration (Alex Hawke) been properly advised in January 2021, it may safely be assumed that he would in all likelihood have intervened ... as he ultimately did in May.” Flick was also damning of the previous immigration minister, David Coleman, noting had he “properly considered the plight of the applicant” in March 2019, when he withdrew his application to return to Iraq out of safety concerns, then Coleman “would in all likelihood not have countenanced the continued unlawful detention of the applicant and would in all likelihood have granted him a visa.” As a result of the unlawful detention, the court ruled the commonwealth will have to pay MZZHL $350,000 to compensate him for “the deprivation of his liberty” and “the mental stress he has endured”. Battisson said the judgment was significant because “it really says that active steps have to be taken to pursue removal”. “It says you can’t have just asked the person the same question over and over again to justify the person’s detention ... What tends to happen is people who are detained over a number of years, every so often they’re asked if they want to return to their home country, and they say no, and then they wait a few months in detention before asking them. “I suspect the government will be slightly worried about the precedent this sets about the quantum of damages,” Battisson said. The commonwealth must pay the man’s legal costs and $350,000 in damages within 28 days. The Guardian contacted the Department of Home Affairs for comment.","charCount":"4955","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/elias-visontay\">Elias Visontay</a>"},{"headline":"How to Kidnap the Rich by Rahul Raina review – ripping satire of Indian elites","standfirst":"<p>You can see why HBO is adapting this debut novel, whose blockbuster plot is laced with cynical sharpness</p>","trailText":"You can see why HBO is adapting this debut novel, whose blockbuster plot is laced with cynical sharpness","byline":"Holly Williams","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f31c4dda22c7f5f7a66c19a192bdae5dfb8fb445\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f31c4dda22c7f5f7a66c19a192bdae5dfb8fb445/0_290_5100_3060/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boys on their way to school in Delhi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boys on their way to school in Delhi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: DB Images/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>“The first kidnapping wasn’t my fault.

Andrews has been on extended leave since 9 March, when he slipped and fell on wet stairs at a holiday home on the Mornington Peninsula, breaking several ribs and his T7 vertebra. He is expected to return to work this month, but is awaiting final medical clearance. On Monday, the Victorian opposition issued a statement saying that Andrews should not continue to receive his full salary while on sick leave. “Enough is enough, Daniel Andrews can’t continue to get paid for a job he’s not doing,” opposition treasury spokesperson, Louise Staley, said. “He should only be getting the basic MP’s pay while he’s off work.” She also claimed that Victorians needed “honesty and transparency” from Andrews about how he sustained his injury, and called on him to answer a list of 12 questions about the circumstances of the fall before he returns to work.

He has issued several statements about it since March. Labor MP for Mordialloc, Tim Richardson MP, said the Liberal Party statement was “the most vile and disgusting gutter politics we’re seeing in Victoria”. “Instead of working to support the efforts of Victorians to defeat the Covid-19 pandemic, the Victorian Liberals are spreading conspiracies about premier,” he said. Nick Staikos, state member for Bentleigh, replied to Richardson’s comments saying the Liberal party was worse than rats. Sonja Terpstra, Labor MLC for Eastern Metro, called the Liberal Party statement “puerile”. Labor MP for Eastern Victoria, Harriet Shing, said it was a “cheap, utterly puerile release”. Federal Labor MP Tim Watts and state MP for Bayswater, Jackson Taylor, compared the release to QAnon conspiracy theories. “This goes beyond the pale of politics,” said Taylor. “So extremely disappointing”. Local government minister Shaun Leane invoked more longstanding conspiracies, asking, “if you play a Beatles record backwards will we get the answers?” Earlier, the opposition leader, Michael O’Brien, told reporters he wished the premier well, “but clearly I think there are some questions that are in the public interest to be cleared up at some point”.

revealed watchdog Austrac had serious concerns about their efforts to prevent money laundering and the financing of criminal groups.</p> <p>The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (Austrac) is a government agency tasked with making sure criminals cannot exploit the financial system.</p> <p>Westpac recently fell foul of the watchdog after revelations its lax standards allowed child abuse groups and others to shift money overseas.</p> <p>The bank paid a $1.3bn fine last year, and has other requirements to ensure its meeting legal obligations.</p> <p>Austrac said fines were not being considered for NAB.</p> <p>The two have been working to improve the bank’s controls since 2017.</p> <p>However, Austrac could force the bank to make sweeping changes to its systems, as it did with Westpac.<br></p> <p>NAB boss Ross McEwan said the bank was improving in this area and clearly had more work to do.</p> <p>Crown Resorts’ woes continued after Austrac widened its investigation of the company to include its Perth casino. The watchdog has found the Perth venue has potentially serious problems in meeting anti-money laundering obligations.</p> <p>Austrac is already investigating Crown Melbourne for the same reasons.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-06-07T07:31:52.468Z\">at 8.31am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-60bdc84b8f082ac930aeca24\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-07T07:24:29.310Z\">8.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Fiona Patten</strong>, an influential crossbencher and the leader of the Reason party in Victoria’s upper house, says the Victorian Liberal party’s latest attack on Daniel Andrews is “extraordinary”. </p> <p>Asked if the issues raised today by the opposition were reasonable, Patten replied “no”. </p> <p>“Sadly I saw her press release,” Patten said, referring to the shadow treasurer, Louise Staley, “which did send me down a rabbit hole of conspiracies.” </p> <p>“I actually wish the bloke the best, he probably nearly lost his ability to walk,” Patten said of Andrews. </p> <p>“I hope to see him back at work soon.” </p> <p>Staley said today that Andrews had several questions to answer about how he injured his back earlier this year.

Here are today’s developments: The prime minister, Scott Morrison, called for Victoria to come out of lockdown “as soon as possible”. Victoria recorded 11 new cases, but all were linked to existing outbreaks. The Victorian government announced a $30m emergency relief package. Morrison was with the NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian to announce $500m in joint funding for a new bypass over the Hawkesbury River. Ben Roberts-Smith’s defamation trial opened in Sydney. The youngest daughter of a Tamil family being detained on Christmas Island while they fight deportation was medically evacuated to Perth. Thanks for joining us. See you tomorrow. Approval has been given for the first phase of the $500m redevelopment of the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, reports AAP. The National Capital Authority has given the nod for early works including the demolition of Anzac Hall. The NCA had asked for further information on tree removal and replacement planting, noting that there were 595 trees in the precinct. “A total of 455 trees are to be retained, while 140 trees are to be removed as part of the project,” the NCA’s chairman Terry Weber said in a statement on Monday. The NCA will require that the AWM plant a minimum of an additional 250 native trees as a condition of approval for these works. With this change noted, the NCA has concluded the proposal is not inconsistent with the National Capital Plan and the works have been approved. The NCA, which has published a 1,200-page consultation report, received 601 submissions during its consultation process, of which three were in support. Key concerns were the need for the expansion, tree removal, the impacts on heritage values and the cost. The AWM argues the project will address constraints to the existing use of the building, improve the overall visitor and veterans’ experience and maintain its significance as a national cultural institution. The current Anzac Hall is a bespoke building that is not extendable and is no longer fit for purpose to meet the memorial’s needs to tell the stories of recent conflicts. New galleries created will provide the space needed to share the experiences of Australians who have served in conflict and operations in places including Somalia, Rwanda, Cambodia, Solomon Islands, East Timor, Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria. The Greens Immigration spokesperson Nick McKim has issued a statement after news the youngest daughter of the Biloela family has been airlifted to hospital. This family’s treatment has been appalling and disgraceful. They have been exiled to a remote island, and detained indefinitely, having built a life for themselves in Queensland. Physical and mental health problems have always gone hand in hand with offshore detention – and yet their detention continues. It is beyond unconscionable that they would be sent back to Christmas Island. They must be resettled in our community urgently, before any more damage is done. National Australia Bank and three casino operators may need to pay hefty fines or overhaul their operations after a blitz by the financial crimes watchdog, reports AAP. The bank, Crown Resorts, SkyCity and Star Entertainment on Monday revealed watchdog Austrac had serious concerns about their efforts to prevent money laundering and the financing of criminal groups. The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (Austrac) is a government agency tasked with making sure criminals cannot exploit the financial system. Westpac recently fell foul of the watchdog after revelations its lax standards allowed child abuse groups and others to shift money overseas. The bank paid a $1.3bn fine last year, and has other requirements to ensure its meeting legal obligations. Austrac said fines were not being considered for NAB. The two have been working to improve the bank’s controls since 2017. However, Austrac could force the bank to make sweeping changes to its systems, as it did with Westpac. NAB boss Ross McEwan said the bank was improving in this area and clearly had more work to do. Crown Resorts’ woes continued after Austrac widened its investigation of the company to include its Perth casino. The watchdog has found the Perth venue has potentially serious problems in meeting anti-money laundering obligations. Austrac is already investigating Crown Melbourne for the same reasons. Fiona Patten, an influential crossbencher and the leader of the Reason party in Victoria’s upper house, says the Victorian Liberal party’s latest attack on Daniel Andrews is “extraordinary”. Asked if the issues raised today by the opposition were reasonable, Patten replied “no”. “Sadly I saw her press release,” Patten said, referring to the shadow treasurer, Louise Staley, “which did send me down a rabbit hole of conspiracies.” “I actually wish the bloke the best, he probably nearly lost his ability to walk,” Patten said of Andrews. “I hope to see him back at work soon.” Staley said today that Andrews had several questions to answer about how he injured his back earlier this year. She said he should not be receiving his premier’s salary and should instead be on an MP’s base pay. Labor MPs have savaged Staley’s comments, saying the opposition was peddling conspiracies, with one accusing the Liberals of “vile and disgusting gutter politics”. Foxtel will save between $10m and $12m a year if legislation to halve its commitment to producing Australian drama becomes law, Foxtel has told a legislation committee. The Morrison government’s broadcasting bill, which slashes Foxtel’s requirement to spend 10% of its drama budget on Australian content to 5%, has passed the house but is being reviewed by the senate. Foxtel chief executive Patrick Delany told senators the local drama quota cost the pay TV company $24m a year when it was at 10%. Foxtel has welcomed the proposed reduction and said it won’t alter its commitment to Australian production which includes recent dramas Wentworth and The End. The pay TV company told the senate it had invested $217m on lifestyle programming and $265m on drama programming in the last five years. Delany said Foxtel earnings have halved in the same period of time as they’ve been swamped by international streaming services like Netflix, and yet they were subjected to laws that were decades old. Melbourne-based Liberal MP Katie Allen wants the state government to provide more details on the targets for coming out of lockdown. She tells the ABC’s Afternoon Briefing: I would like to know what the roadmap is. What we would be comfortable about opening up with. What is the yardstick? If they have in the back of their mind they are only going to open up certain places or not, we need to know. People are on the edge of their seats. The long weekend is coming up. We need to know what is going to happen. The ABC has confirmed the prime minister’s press secretary Andrew Carswell contacted ABC news director Gaven Morris at around 6pm on 1 June about the Four Corners story on QAnon. “Mr Carswell asked if the Four Corners Program concerning QAnon was going to air,” the ABC said in a statement released after senate estimates. “Mr Morris said it was and the PMO should answer the detailed questions that had been put to it. Mr Morris said the team had been in contact with the PMO on more than 20 occasions seeking answers to questions put in writing and it wasn’t tenable that the PMO did not respond to the questions. Mr Carswell said he would ensure answers were provided. That was the entire conversation. “The PMO subsequently contacted Four Corners saying they would respond to the questions. Knowing a response was expected to be included in the program, Mr Morris endorsed the program sent to the Managing Director for his approval.” Anderson earlier told estimates that he reviewed the program and asked Four Corners for more details after the program was sent to him by Morris. He said the PM’s adviser called about the program but no-one in the government had pressured the ABC to pull the program. The vice president of the Australia Medical Association Dr Chris Moy has been asked on the ABC if the numbers in Victoria justify extending the lockdown. He doesn’t answer directly, but here are his thoughts: Look, the numbers are pretty much stable over the last few days and I think that is a positive thing. It is really a question of how many sort of contacts and how many sort of exposure sites they have got. I think that is just as important. Speaking to contact tracers, what they’re trying to work out is have they got to the edge of this, have they got it surrounded and have a reasonably good idea of where they are at with it? They probably have a much better idea about that first one that came from South Australia. But this other one, [the Delta variant case] I think they are really starting from scratch at the moment and that is the worry because they really do not know where boundary of this is. Obviously not huge numbers but the fact that it’s came out of the blue is a real worry particularly because it looks like it is more of an infectious variant. Here’s the latest from the disability royal commission from, well, from me. The commission is meeting in Adelaide this week, examining cases of abuse in disability care. A South Australian family have told of their fear after receiving an anonymous letter warning their nephew would be “abused with cruelty, violence, regularly and repeatedly” and might be poisoned or drowned at his supported disability accommodation. The youngest daughter of a Tamil family being detained on Christmas Island while they fight deportation has been medically evacuated to Perth, according to change.org. In a statement issued on Monday afternoon, Change said Tharnicaa of the ‘Biloela family’ was being medically evacuated to Perth after being hospitalised on Christmas Island with a suspected blood infection (septicaemia). The statement said her mother, Priya, would accompany her to Perth but the other two members of the family would stay on Christmas Island. It said the Queensland-born three-year-old had been unwell for 10 days. She was taken to hospital on Sunday. The family was moved to Christmas Island in late 2019 after a court injunction prevented them being removed from Australia. That legal battle is continuing. Guardian Australia has approached the Department of Home Affairs for comment. A statement from Priya, distributed by Change, said: I am feeling very scared and worried for my little girl. She has been sick for many days, it took a long time for her to get to the hospital. She is already asking for her papa, it is going to be very hard being away from her Dad and sister. It is very hard for our family to be separated when our daughter is sick. Commodore Young adds that 7,777 people in disability residential setting have been vaccinated. There are about 22,000 across the country. There are still four aged care homes yet to have a first-dose visit, Young confirms. The remaining four are among the 2,565 aged care facilities across Australia. He says 2,163 homes – or 84% – have had a first and second dose visit. Authorities expect to do another 290 homes this week. In Victoria, all of the 596 homes have had a first dose visit, while 457 have had their second dose visit also. Australia is now averaging 136,000 doses per weekday, Young says. There has been an increasing uptake in the 50 to 69-year-old cohort. Young says the coming week will be “our biggest week”. He says 1.1 million doses will be distributed to 2,500 locations across the country. “This will include 71,370 doses of Pfizer and 41,000 doses of AstraZeneca vaccine to state hubs and another 280,000 doses of AstraZeneca vaccine to the primary care network across Victoria,” he says. Commodore Eric Young says there were 832,000 doses of vaccine administered across the country, last week. It took the total beyond 5 million. Young says: “It took 47 days to get to our first one million doses of vaccine administered and just nine days to get to our most recent million. He notes 327,538 doses of vaccine were administered in Victoria “through a combination of state and Commonwealth clinics”. Kelly is also urging people to get vaccinated. We had an expansion of the eligibility criteria on Friday, as a decision from national cabinet, so many more people are now eligible in Australia to get vaccinated. He says you can check your eligibility at health.gov.au. The chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, has stepped up. He confirms there have been 16 new cases in Australia over the past 24 hours, with five of those overseas acquired in hotel quarantine. The other 11 are the new cases in Victoria. Of those 11, nine of those are already in quarantine, they’re known contacts of cases so they’ve already, during their infectious period, being isolated from the community. So that doesn’t lead to any further risk. That’s a good thing. A search is under way for a 71-year-old woman missing in the Northern Territory’s Litchfield National Park, reports AAP. The woman failed to return on Sunday from a bushwalk near Wangi Falls, about 110km south of Darwin, NT police said. Rescue specialists, police and park rangers started searching on Monday morning. Superintendent Brendan Muldoon urged travellers in the area to keep an eye out for the woman. “She is reportedly a fit and experienced hiker. However, the terrain is challenging out there and we have concerns for her safety,” he said. The minimum overnight temperature in the park was 19C, with a maximum of 32C. Much of the terrain near Wangi Falls is thick bush and hilly. Not everyone in the Victorian Liberals is on the same page on this it appears. Opposition leader Michael O’Brien didn’t weigh in at a press conference today. The Victorian Liberal opposition has attacked the premier, Daniel Andrews, for pocketing his salary while he remains on leave. In a new statement, and fairly significant escalation of the opposition’s rhetoric on this issue, the shadow treasurer, Louise Staley, says: Enough is enough, Daniel Andrews can’t continue to get paid for a job he’s not doing. He should only be getting the basic MP’s pay while he’s off work. Victorians need honesty and transparency from Daniel Andrews about the circumstances of his injury. Everyone is entitled to privacy about their health, but these questions are not about the nature of his injuries, only how he got those injuries. If there is no cover up then there is no reason not to provide answers to these simple questions. Catherine Andrews posted the following photo recently: The premier also tweeted last week: Some advice from Rex Patrick. McGowan declines to weigh in on Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk’s decision to get the Pfizer vaccine in case she needs to go to the Tokyo Olympics. “I don’t know anything about that,” he says, a little bemused. He then adds: “Is she in the age group? Never talk about a woman’s age. Very dangerous.” Mark McGowan has also strongly backed calls for pharmacists to join the vaccine rollout. I have been a strong supporter of that. At National Cabinet I have raised that that we should have as many opportunities for vaccines to be rolled out, as many locations, as possible. So pharmacies are all over the state, there’s about 700 of them, and they are good at issuing flu vaccinations so I think it would be a good thing. That is currently on the agenda of the National Cabinet and I am pushing for it. Asked about whether aged care workers should face mandatory vaccinations, he says he thinks that’s a “good idea”, subject to some exemptions. “We do it for flu vaccinations,” McGowan says. He also suggests the Pfizer vaccine “should be available to the entire aged care workforce”. Mark McGowan says WA is considering adding a 17th day, post-hotel, quarantine test. People are currently tested three times while in hotel quarantine in WA. The Western Australian premier, Mark McGowan, has stepped up to discuss a confirmed Covid-19 case in the state. McGowan says the person is a “very low risk of being a spreader of the virus” but has been sent back to hotel quarantine. He is shedding not spreading. That is the advice but as a precaution he’s back into hotel quarantine. We had 33 casual contacts who have all been contacted. He wore a mask for the day that he was in public. He went to, I think, three separate venues and he had dinner at one restaurant. The advice I have is that he is very, very low risk but as a precaution he has gone back into quarantine. A little context to the below. There was a little bit of consternation in Melbourne this morning (full disclosure: where I’m based) after the state recorded 11 cases. The state’s department of health noted later on Twitter the cases were linked to existing outbreaks. Hello everyone. Luke Henriques-Gomes here. I’ll be with you for the next short while. Thanks to Mostafa for steering the ship this morning. Do let me know if you see anything worth sharing. I’m on Twitter @lukehgomes. Onwards. And with that, my time on today’s blog will come to an end, but fear not, I leave in you in the ever capable hands of Luke Henriques-Gomes for the afternoon’s news. Thanks for reading! Global credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poor’s has lifted its outlook on Australia’s economy, indicating the country’s top-tier AAA rating is safe. AAP has the story: S&amp;P said the improved outlook reflects its expectations that government budget deficits will narrow in line with its forecasts. “We expect the budget to be supported by steady revenue growth, aided by robust commodity prices and expenditure restraint,” the agency said on Monday. “We believe Australia’s external accounts are likely to remain stronger than in the past and be resilient during potential crises.” It said Australia has a strong track record of managing major economic shocks, moderating the agency’s concern over the nation’s high level of external and household debt. The Northern Territory is expanding the age range for vaccinations, allowing all over 16s to get the jab. The NT becomes the first jurisdiction to offer the vaccine to almost everyone, and makes the vaccine available to another 60,000 people there. The chief minister, Michael Gunner, said it was a “sensible” decision to take: This is a sensible decision, based on our indigeneity, mobility and vulnerability. When you consider not just the make-up of the Darwin population but how people move in and out of Darwin it makes sense to treat us as you would a remote vaccination centre. This decision will also breed vaccine confidence – the more people you know, who you work and play with, will have the vax.” So the discussions around Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk’s vaccination this morning have continued, with a many questioning both the reason given (to go to the Olympics?) and the choice of vaccine: For what it’s worth, the premier defended getting the Pfizer vaccine, saying it was so she could get her second dose...before the Tokyo Olympics. “There may be a requirement for the state to present to the whole (International) Olympics Committee about the Olympics, and I wouldn’t have been unvaccinated and that’s why I had the Pfizer,” Palaszczuk told reporters. I, for one, would also like a vaccine and a trip to the Olympics. OK, so here’s what we learned at today’s press conference: 11 new cases reported today, including three children, two aged care workers, a resident at said facility, and a new case in West Melbourne. No fresh announcements on the extent or timing of the Melbourne lockdown. The Victorian government announced a $30m support package for the state, with a focus on emergency relief. The new case in West Melbourne means there is an increase in the list of exposure sites and close contacts. The health minister welcomed the additional vaccine doses allocated by the commonwealth. Not quite as terrible as early reports suggested. It was good to get the context on those numbers and cases. And now Foley is asked about the impacts lockdowns are having on the mental health of children: We know that mental health system in the country, let alone the state, has been under huge challenge before the pandemic. That’s why we called a royal commission. We saw during the course of, right across the country, the reports of how presentations, particularly for young people, whether they be community or acute services, had gone up. That’s why the royal commission’s recommendations that were adopted by the Victorian government specifically fund and commit to arrangements to address precisely that issue, and that’s why when it comes to the work that all the states put to national cabinet last Friday, on hospital demand, one of the biggest areas of increased demand right across the country, the Ambulance Victoria, ambulance callouts, presentations and emergency departments and presentations at community settings is mental health challenges and particularly issues for young people with mental health, this is a national crisis in our system, we welcome the royal commission’s recommendations, we welcome the work done by all the national health commissioner. Will the vaccine age limit be dropped any time soon? Testing commander Jeroen Weimar had this to say: We will drop the age when we start to see demand soften. I think, from the numbers in my head at the moment ... around one in five Victorians aged 40 to 49 have had their first dose. We will start the second dose in a week or two, and I want to make sure we can get them completed as fast as we can. We’ve done around just over 36% of Victorians aged 50 to 69. We are part of a national program and the rollout was set up really around those high-risk occupations first – we have a good record – and then vulnerability, age-based, work your way down, knowing those older are more vulnerable than those younger. We are not going to keep shifting around in this program, this is now a thing Victorians understand. Forty and above, you can get vaccinated. If you are Aboriginal and Torres straight Islander over 16, you can get vaccinated. Certain medical conditions, you can get vaccinated. Critical workforces, you can get vaccinated. Ben Roberts-Smith’s defamation trial has opened in Sydney. His barrister Bruce McClintock has begun by describing the Victoria Cross recipient’s skill as a soldier, saying: This is a case of courage, devotion to duty, self-sacrifice and – perhaps most important of all – surpassing skill in soldiering, on one hand. On the other hand, it’s a case about dishonest journalism, corrosive jealousy, cowardice and lies … led by bitter people, jealous of [Roberts-Smith’s] courage and success, aided by credulous journalists. McClintock emphasised to Justice Anthony Besanko: “War is violent”, and that soldiers are required, at times, to “kill the enemy”. He said Roberts-Smith’s detractors have “forgotten the violence of war in their rush to tear him down”. McClintock quoted Winston Churchill: We sleep soundly in our beds because rough men stand ready in the night to visit violence on those who would do us harm. The soldier himself is in the courtroom, supported by his parents. He is expected to give evidence later this week. Roberts-Smith, 42, is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times for defamation over a series of reports published in 2018 which he alleges are defamatory because they portray him as someone who “broke the moral and legal rules of military engagement” and committed war crimes including murder. The court heard on Monday that the newspapers allege Roberts-Smith committed six murders, on five separate occasions, while deployed to Afghanistan as a member of the SAS regiment. He is also accused of bullying fellow soldiers and committing domestic violence. Roberts-Smith, 42, has consistently denied the allegations, saying they are “false”, “baseless” and “completely without any foundation in truth”. Testing commander Jeroen Weimar is now asked about concerns (??) about stockpiling vaccines in the state. He explains it was a “flow process”, that all vaccines received are flowing into people’s arms. When vaccine arrives our depots, into our hubs, we have to go through a process of disturbing it to over 48 of our clinics. We also have some clinics, that has to go through a process of pharmacists who have to make up the vaccine into the doses – that takes time. Vaccine doses that arrived yesterday from the commonwealth, which I’m very grateful for, takes me at least a week to convert into a viable product they can hand out to people. We will do over 150-or-160,000 doses in the week ahead. The stock we have at the moment is about right for the scale [of the] program we’re running, so we don’t run out at some local centres. It was great we got some additional uplift of supply from our colleagues in the commonwealth last week. That was great. We have a temporary bump up in our numbers. It will also go through into the clinics in the next week or so and into arms in the following week. There is no concern at all about our work. An interesting interaction now, with Sutton asked if the outbreak stems from diplomats who are allowed to quarantine at home. He says: We simply don’t know. Wouldn’t rule anything in or out. We are obviously checking against everyone who is tested, and diplomats should be tested as well. But without a match we can’t say. Sutton is then asked if he has the figures for how many people are exempt from quarantine, and says he doesn’t but they are “in the tens”. Sutton was also asked about the PM’s nudge of Victoria to end its lockdown as soon as possible, and said no state had handled similar outbreaks to Victoria: Outbreaks previously across the country have either been single cases who have had some community exposures – we have seen circuit-breaker lockdowns, it is not as though they haven’t occurred, they have occurred a couple of times in Perth, a couple of times in Brisbane, with single cases or just a couple of cases. And previous outbreaks in Victoria had been handled without lockdowns; they were handled through contact tracing, and the Black Rock outbreak as an example of that. We are dealing with a variants of concern. I don’t want to say it is some order of magnitude more dangerous. But 75% of people within households becoming positive when there is a case, there is a challenge. Chief health officer Brett Sutton was asked if he was concerned that a number of the new cases came after a day-13 test. He said: I don’t think it is a concern. We have thousands of primary close contacts, they will all go through that early testing. If they are identified as cases, they going into isolation for the 10 days. But they will always get an ‘exit test’, if you like – day 13 is the need there. A number of those don’t have any symptoms, and [were] picked up on the day-13 tests. They were picked up on day seven – they might have tested positive earlier but the fact that every single one of them needs to have a confirmed day-13 test before they are released from quarantine is a standard precaution, to be absolutely sure. And there will be a number who only get picked up on that test. Testing commander Jeroen Weimar has given some further details on the new case who worked as a cleaner at a construction site. Weimar said the person was known to authorities, having been a close contact, and it meant there were a few more exposure sites the individual travelled to, including taking a train trip. We have over 490 primary close contacts, and over 400 have returned a negative test results – an encouraging step forward. There are a few more to chase down. The immediate work colleagues of the cleaners have all returned negative test results but we will continue to drive hard on [testing]. The minister for disability, ageing and carers, Luke Donnellan, has announced the state government has put together a $30m support package for the state, to make sure “no one will be left behind” and that everyone has access to emergency and hardship payments. So far, that includes $4.5m for that emergency relief, as well as $12m for culturally and linguistically diverse communities, $5m for emergency food relief and $7m to bolster communication, case management and service access. Health minister Martin Foley has addressed the state’s increased allocation of vaccines, saying Victoria had been “eating into our supplies”: We welcome the federal government’s allocations announced yesterday, particularly when it comes to doubling the supply for the next few weeks of AstraZeneca for our GPs. That is most welcome. We have in fact been eating into our supplies. And having demonstrated that, I was pleased with the commonwealth providing Victoria extra doses beyond our allocated standard numbers. Health minister Martin Foley has given further context to the 11 cases reported today, which include three children and an adult, another staff member at the Arcare aged care facility (in addition to the resident and staff member reported yesterday, but included in today’s numbers) and four household contacts of the Whittlesea outbreak. The final numbers include a new case in Port Melbourne: a construction worker who has been previously identified. The Victorian press conference has begun. There is no clash between ABC management and Four Corners over the QAnon story, Senate estimates has been told. An upcoming episode examining the relationship between the prime minister, Scott Morrison, and a supporter of the QAnon conspiracy theory was delayed for review last week. ABC managing director David Anderson said he respected Four Corners and stood by its journalism, despite his decision as editor-in-chief to delay the QAnon story. He said: I do have absolute faith and the utmost respect for the 4C team... it is not unreasonable for me to question certain things. News Corp reported on Monday that Four Corners was at war with management. Anderson said no one in government or the Liberal party had contacted the ABC and demanded the story not be aired and that the ABC board had not been consulted over the issue. However, he confirmed that an adviser for Morrison had contacted ABC news chief Gaven Morris about the story. Anderson said: I do not believe there has been an intervention by the government or anyone else that the program should not go to air. We are on standby for the Victorian press conference, thankfully no crossover today, but I wonder if we’ll hear any reaction to Scott Morrison essentially putting some pressure on the state government to lift lockdown “as soon as possible”. Finally, the PM was also asked his thoughts on the Queensland premier getting the Pfizer jab so she could go to the Olympics. He says: I have no plans to go to those Olympics. I’ll be looking forward to seeing the Japanese prime minister next weekend – this weekend coming, I should say – at the G7. Can you imagine having gone through all those preparations and then having the world struck by a pandemic? That I know was quite heartbreaking for the people of Japan and so we wish them all the best as they persevere and put these Games on. Next up, Morrison was asked if the lockdown in Victoria should be extended. He says: That would ultimately be a decision for the Victorian government, as it always is. The commonwealth will determine its position through the chief medical officer. We are seeing the cases that are identified, occurring in quarantining, and whether they are presenting in other areas, a contained situation. Here in Australia, we are living in a way with this virus like few if any other countries other than New Zealand are in the world. And this is a challenging lockdown but it’s one that will be overcome and it will be one that I hope will see Victoria opened again soon, particularly for those parents who are having to keep the kids at home away from school. Kids have lost enough time out of school over the course of the last 18 months. It’s very important we get those kids to school as soon as possible. I am hopeful that these restrictions in Victoria will be lifted as soon as possible. As the premier herself said when similar circumstances were faced here, in New South Wales, the restrictions were contained to a very specific part of Sydney, so I would be urging that we move towards lifting those restrictions as soon as possible. We will be in a position tomorrow for Victorians affected to go online and make those applications for the payments, and there will be further updates provided by the minister for Services Australia later today to confirm those arrangements. So, with the PM slightly smirking behind her, Berejiklian has kind of clarified her call on the government to build and run its own quarantine facility in New South Wales, saying it was because NSW was at “capacity”. The point I was making is we are at our operational capacity. So if there was any proposal in the future, it wouldn’t come from us because we are at stretch point now. The expert advice is, New South Wales, once you get over 5,000, and sometimes 5,500 at any one time, when you creep up over that you are at a very high risk point. The point I made was we certainly wouldn’t be putting on a request to operate any additional facility because we don’t have the capacity, we are at capacity now. As the prime minister said, down the track, quarantine could look different once the majority of our population is vaccinated and international borders are open. That is a different question but at this point in time, we don’t have capacity, that’s the point I was making. I post the following with zero comment: Prime minister Scott Morrison and NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian have announced they are combining forces to fund a $500m bypass over the Hawkesbury River to solve “traffic issues.” From what I’ve understood, this will be a new bridge over the river, to relieve the “choke point” at the Richmond bridge. This, by the way, was the same bridge that flooded during the one-in-100-year rain event earlier this year. So, apparently the PM and the NSW premier are set to make a major infrastructure announcement at any time now. It looks like we’re going to have presser crossover. Excellent Monday morning. I want to go back to Gladys Berejiklian’s time on 2GB this morning, where she also piled pressure on to the federal government to find alternatives to hotel quarantine. She repeated her calls for the government to build and run its own dedicated quarantine hubs in NSW. We don’t know how long the pandemic is going to be with us and I just say to the feds 5,000 [people in quarantine] is all we can do in NSW at any one time. We need to think about when the vast majority of our population is vaccinated, international travel resumes, presumably quarantine will look a bit different to what it is now. The feds do have to consider what that means for the future of facilities. If they want extra capacity in NSW, they’re going to have to build and run it themselves. We’re not in the business of operating a federally-built quarantine facility The premier also said hotels couldn’t be used forever, especially if international borders opened again. In the meantime, New South Wales has recorded zero locally acquired cases today, but is reporting five cases in overseas travellers: Also of note is that in the week ending Sunday 6 June NSW delivered more than 80,000 vaccines, including more than 33,000 jabs administered at the Sydney Olympic Park vaccination centre. NSW has now administered just under 1.5 million vaccines in total, with nearly a million of those coming from the GP network. I’m hearing that the PM will be stepping up for a presser alongside NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian in the next half hour, which should be fun, but also I hope it doesn’t overlap with the Victorian presser. Please line them up, guys, please. ABC MD David Anderson has contradicted Christian Porter’s claims last week that the ABC is “humiliated”, that it had “backed down” and that it regretted the article the ABC published. The former attorney general gave a bullish press conference outside court last week in which he said the ABC had been “forced to say they regret the outcome of the reporting”. He said: They have been forced by my taking this action all the way to the court door, they have been forced to say they regret the article.. I never thought that they would concede that the accusations that were put in the article could never be proven. But Anderson told a Senate estimates hearing that the ABC was not humiliated and “did not regret the article”. All that had happened was an editor’s note had been attached to the article. Anderson said: The editor’s note said that both parties accept that some readers misinterpreted the article as an accusation of guilt against Mr Porter and that reading, not intended, was regretted. Senator, again I’ll just suggest that the editor’s note was agreed by both parties, and was affixed to the online article as [of] that Monday. Anderson stopped short of agreeing with a suggestion that what Porter said outside court was “nonsense”. Finally, the Victorian Department of Health has given *some* context, after dropping the numbers this morning without any explanation: This appears to be good news, but many people on Twitter are pointing out the needless anxiety that comes with just plonking numbers onto social media without an explanation, and without a time for the press conference. We are still waiting on the confirmation of the time for that presser as well. So, Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has had her first dose of the Covid vaccine, and marked the occasion with a characteristic tweet and video: But there are some elements to this that need a second look. According to the premier, she got the Pfizer jab because... she has to go to the Olympics? Why does she need to go to the Olympics? I mean sure, perhaps to push for the 2032 Brisbane bid, but couldn’t it be a Zoom call? And also, with all the consternation around the AstraZeneca v Pfizer jab, it is interesting she has gotten the latter. Questions abound. Ben Roberts-Smith has arrived in court for the first day of his defamation hearing against three newspapers over their reporting of war crimes allegations against him. The Victoria Cross recipient walked into court alone, wearing a suit, and did not speak to waiting media, but greeted a well-wisher with a brief “thanks mate”. His mother, Sue, and father, Len, a judge and major general in the Australian army, hugged him in court when they arrived and took up seats behind him. Roberts-Smith will be the first person to give evidence in the case. He is expected to take the stand later this week. Roberts-Smith, 42, is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times for defamation over a series of reports published in 2018 which he alleges are defamatory because they portray him as someone who “broke the moral and legal rules of military engagement” and committed war crimes including murder. Roberts-Smith, 42, has consistently denied the allegations, saying they were “false”, “baseless” and “completely without any foundation in truth”. ABC managing director David Anderson is defending the broadcaster’s social media policy, after telling senators that Four Corners executive producer Sally Neighbour won’t be disciplined for an inaccurate tweet about Porter dropping his defamation action. Anderson said Neighbour’s tweet was inaccurate and he had contacted news chief Gaven Morris to tell him to contact her immediately and get her to take it down. Neighbour deleted it and followed up with an accurate tweet. Liberal senator Sarah Henderson asked him why the ABC didn’t follow the BBC’s lead and simply ban journalists from tweeting about certain subjects. Anderson said ABC staff were required to act in a certain way and the guidelines were “sophisticated and enforceable”. The ABC has also confirmed that a story published in the Australian last week saying the ABC had apologised to the judge for Neighbour’s tweet was incorrect. In completely normal Sydney news, Domain is reporting a house with no kitchen and no toilet in the south-east has sold for $4.07m at an auction this weekend. That’s right, no kitchen and no toilet. Over $4 million. Described as “uninhabitable”. The house in Kensington also has no power or water connected and a leaking roof. But that didn’t put off bidders. For some comparison, the previous owners bought the home for $1.1m in 2005. There were 1048 (!!) auctions in Sydney at the weekend, with 770 results reported. Which feels crazy. The National Australia Bank is facing an investigation after allegations of potentially serious and ongoing non-compliance with anti-money laundering laws were made in a letter from the industry watchdog, Austrac. In its letter to NAB, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre outlined serious concerns about the bank’s customer identification procedures, ongoing customer due diligence, and compliance with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws. Austrac’s enforcement team is now taking a look at the matter and will determine if any further action is required. Austrac has a wide range of enforcement options available to it, including civil penalty orders, enforceable undertakings, infringement notices and remedial directions. Speaking to the SMH, NAB boss Ross McEwan said it would cooperate with the investigation. We are very aware that we need to further improve our performance in relation to these matters. We have been working to improve and clearly have more to do. It is a key priority for everyone at NAB to uplift our financial crime capabilities, minimise risk to customers and the bank, and improve operational performance. That’s why we are so focused on getting the basics right every time to protect our customers and our bank. Queensland reports no news Covid cases The ABC will pay $100,000 in mediation costs to Christian Porter’s legal firm, ABC managing director David Anderson has told parliament. Under the agreement between the ABC and Porter, the ABC was given permission to tell the Senate details of the otherwise confidential agreement. So there’s a fair amount of anxiety making the rounds about today’s Covid numbers, especially since Melbourne is supposedly due to emerge from lockdown on Thursday. We’re still waiting on confirmation for when the press conference will be to hear what authorities have to say, but I thought Josh Taylor made a good point here: So, and this is speculation, but it is possible these numbers are just a ripple effect from the initial outbreak. But we will see. ABC managing director David Anderson was up at Senate estimates at 9am this morning after he was recalled to be questioned about the end of the Christian Porter defamation suit, which the former attorney general dropped last week. The MD is expected to be grilled about the details of the confidential agreement with Porter after the Australian reported that Porter would receive “a sum in the vicinity of $100,000 from the ABC” – a claim the ABC denies. A spokesperson said: The ABC has not and will not pay any amount to Mr Porter. ABC managing director David Anderson has been asked to appear before the Senate estimates committee on Monday 7 June and will have the opportunity to respond to a range of issues. The original reporting on this matter remains unaltered on the public record and we stand by our journalists and the work they do in the public interest. Our staff are aware of their responsibilities under the ABC’s ‘personal use of social media’ guidelines and the processes in place to ensure compliance with those guidelines. We are also expecting some questions about the ABC’s social media policy. Victoria is reporting 11 new coronavirus cases in the 24 hours to midnight last night. But the good news is that more than 17,000 vaccine dose were administered, and more than 24,000 tests taken. The two cases announced yesterday – a nurse and a resident at an aged care facility – are also included in those numbers. We’re still waiting for today today’s Covid numbers out of Victoria, but since we’re previewing what’s coming up, I thought I’d also add that ABC boss David Anderson will be quizzed in estimates today, which should be interesting in light of his decision to delay the airing of a Four Corners episode that looked at the PM’s ties to a a QAnon conspiracy theorist. Deputy PM Michael McCormak, looking absolutely freezing this morning, received his own jab today, and indicated that he thought some vaccine complacency had come with Australia’s “strong” response to the pandemic. It is a worldwide effort to combat this insidious virus but Australia has done very well when you consider America. We have had one death this year. We have done very well and that has led to a level of complacency across the community. I will get the jab and I will get it whenever. I say to Australians make sure you do. Don’t wait. Get the jab when you’re eligible to do so and do it for yourself and for your community. More (ex) politicians on morning shows! This time, it’s former PM Malcolm Turnbull on RN Breakfast throwing his support behind vaccine passports, both domestic and international. Turnbull said the idea was sound and that vaccine hesitancy needed to be addressed. I know people will say this is tough, this is non-libertarian. [But] we need to be able to have good records so people can authoritatively and accurately say whether or not they have been vaccinated. Australians have to be tough about this and make it very clear that there are some things you will not be able to do if you are not vaccinated. Similar to no jab, no play. But if you want to work in healthcare, if you want to work in aged care [and] if you want to get on an airplane, if you want to go to a cinema, we are entitled to say you can’t do it to protect the rest of the community. A virus can spread at the speed of a jet airplane. So we cannot treat this as just a one-in-100-year event. We’ve got to make sure we we don’t waste this crisis. So just on those Newspoll results, I thought I’d give it a bit of a rundown as we head into the rest of the day. So the Coalition drew level with Labor on a two-party preferred basis for the first time in months, leaving them at 50-50. Support for the Coalition rose from 49% in May, with the last time the parties deadlocked being in February. On a primary vote basis, however, the Coalition still leads Labor 41-36. Backing for the Greens dropped a percentage point to 11, while One Nation’s primary vote rose from 2 to 3%. PM Scott Morrison’s numbers dropped pretty sharply, from 58% in mid-May to 54%, but Labor’s Anthony Albanese’s approval rating also dropped from 39% to 38%. And in terms of who would make a better prime minister, Morrison maintains his lead over Albanese, with 53% backing Morrison compared to 32% for Albanese. Sticking with politicians on morning shows, senator Jacquie Lambie was on the Today Show saying the latest Newspoll results should give the PM a jolt. If this hasn’t been a kick up the backside, I don’t know how else to get him to better manage Covid. He needs to stop saying it is the states or the premier down here or whatever. Start taking responsibility for your lack of actions. I just don’t think he has been on top of his game since he got in. Covid has knocked him around. I don’t think he has handled it as well as what he probably could have. It of course comes after the PM’s approval rating dropped from 58 % to 54 %, according to the poll. NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian was on the radio this morning saying NSW should receive a “fair share of the vaccine” after federal health minister Greg Hunt yesterday announced Victoria will be receiving an extra 330,000 vaccines. Speaking on 2GB, Berejiklian said the outbreak in Victoria looked under control and it was only fair NSW received it’s “fair share”. Anything we can do to help we should, [but] I think fair is fair and we should just receive based on the size of every state. We are taking in lots of bodies every week through the airport and we do it because it’s the right thing to do. We have a lot on our shoulders as well. I think it’s only fair that we get our fair share of the vaccine. NSW has had similar if not larger outbreaks and we’ve dealt with things as we’ve seen fit. I just think moving forward we just have to offer states an incentive for doing the right thing, offer states an incentive for getting on top of things and I hope that’s the way things happen in the future. Straight out of the gates this morning (or lingering from last night – it’s a matter of perspective) is Labor Senator Kristina Keneally, releasing a joint statement with Catherine King, calling for an “urgent review” of security at Australia’s airport. It comes after a report from 60 Minutes yesterday, followed up by reports in the Sydney Morning Herald, alleged that Qantas had been infiltrated by organised crime to facilitate drug importation. Keneally described the revelations as “deeply disturbing” and said it was “frustrating” the Coalition had “held up” changes to airport security legislation, although it is unclear how that would stop alleged criminals being hired by Qantas. Of note also was Australia Criminal Intelligence Commission boss Mike Phelan saying Australia “has an insatiable demand for all types of drugs”. Make of that what you will. Some tweets now to visualise those Newspoll results: Good morning and happy Monday to all. My name is Mostafa Rachwani and I will be guiding you through the news this morning. We begin with a poll of over 1,000 people that found that 75% of Australians support compulsory Covid vaccines for aged care staff, coming on the heels of last week’s national cabinet meeting, where the idea was being seriously considered. It comes after Victoria recorded four cases yesterday, including a 79-year-old resident and a nurse at an aged care centre. The resident lives in “close proximity” to the previous two cases from the Arcare aged care home in Maidstone. It also comes after Western Australia was put on alert after a returned overseas travelled tested positive after leaving hotel quarantine. There are now a number of potential exposure sites and the man is back in hotel quarantine. In federal politics, health minister Greg Hunt announced an extra 330,000 vaccines would be directed to Victoria, and said people should seize the “moment of momentum” and get a jab. And according to Newspoll, the Coalition has pulled level with Labor on a two-party-preferred basis, but prime minister Scott Morrison’s support has nosedived in the wake of the vaccine rollout.","charCount":"50838","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/luke-henriques-gomes\">Luke Henriques-Gomes</a> (now) and <a href=\"profile/mostafa-rachwani-\">Mostafa Rachwani</a> (earlier)"}]

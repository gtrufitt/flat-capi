Here is the declaration: My directions issued at 5:53pm on 25 May 2021 are revoked and replaced with the following: These directions apply to any person who has arrived or who will arrive in the Northern Territory before 00:01 on 27 May 2021 who has been to any of the locations listed as ‘public exposure sites’ by the Victorian Department of Health on or about the relevant times and dates specified at the following link as updated by the Victorian Department of Health from time to time: https://www.coronavirus.vic.gov.au/exposure-sites 3 Any person who has arrived or who will arrive in the Northern Territory before 00:01 on 27 May 2021 who has been in Victoria since 12 May 2021 must check the above website at least once per day and comply with these directions if a place they have been to becomes a public exposure site. Any person to whom these directions apply who has arrived in the Northern Territory or who will arrive in the Northern Territory before 00:01 on 27 May 2021 who has been to a ‘Tier 1’ site, must travel directly to a suitable place of quarantine and remain in that place, except to submit to testing for COVID-19 (or in an emergency). Once tested, the person must remain in the suitable place of quarantine until noon on the 14th day after the last day the person was in the ‘Tier 1’ site, regardless of whether the result of the test is negative. Note: A person who has already had a test may be required to have further tests, at the direction of an authorised officer. If a public exposure site that was a ‘Tier 1 site’ ceases to be a ‘Tier 1’ site, a person who is in quarantine by reason only of that area formerly being a ‘Tier 1 site’ is not required to remain in quarantine, provided they have been tested for COVID-19 and received a negative result. If a public exposure site that was a ‘Tier 2 site’ or a ‘Tier 3 site’ becomes a ‘Tier 1 site’, a person who has been to the site must travel directly to a suitable place of quarantine and remain in that place, except to submit to testing for COVID-19 (or in an emergency). Once tested, the person must remain in the suitable place of quarantine until noon on the 14th day after the last day the person was in the ‘Tier 1’ site, regardless of whether the result of the test is negative. To avoid doubt, a person to whom these directions apply is considered a person who is required to quarantine under my Directions for Territory Border Restrictions (No.49), and all quarantine requirements under my Directions for Territory Border Restrictions apply. If a place of quarantine is deemed not to be suitable, the CHO will direct quarantine to be undertaken at the Howard Springs or Alice Springs quarantine facilities. People have been preparing for the last few days for a potential lockdown: This is not yet confirmed – we will most likely hear from the acting premier around 10.30 or so now, but it looks very likely: I mean, 18 months on, I think we are very past this conversation. Keep an eye on the exposure list sites here. The Victorian police commissioner has not confirmed the lockdown but says police have been preparing for the possibility: Where are Scott Morrison and Greg Hunt getting the “hotel quarantine has been 99.99% effective” stat from? Mark Butler took a guess while a guest on Steve Price’s livestreamed radio show this morning: I think what they’re doing, and I don’t really know, but I think what they’re doing is they’re just simply using the number of people who’ve gone through hotel quarantine. So that’s quite a lot of people coming home from overseas, and then dividing that by the number of leaks. The problem though is it ignores the fact that every single leak is a massive disaster. The whole city of Melbourne is in huge disruption. I see speculation about the possibility of a lockdown being announced this morning. I don’t know whether that is right but I know that would be enormously distressing. I’m not from Melbourne but my Dad lives in Melbourne. I’ve got other relatives and very close friends there. I know how triggering that would be for a city that was locked down for 111 days last year. To know that 40% of aged care facilities in Melbourne have not been fully vaccinated and I think, scandalously, 29 have not received even a single dose when they were promised all across the country to be vaccinated fully by Easter. Given what we know happened last year, I think must be very distressing for everyone. For those trying to work out the number of Covid cases linked to this latest outbreak in Victoria, it’s at 26. One of the 12 cases was mentioned by James Merlino at yesterday’s press conference. So that makes 11 new cases (the ones we didn’t know about) but 12 in total. Day four of estimates is getting under way – a little bit later in the day we will hear from officials within the finance department who deal with Parliament House staffing issues, so we’ll bring you updates from that. The latest Victoria Health numbers are out: Richard Colbeck was pressed on the 29 Victorian aged care homes who were yet to receive any vaccines (aged care is a federal responsibility) outside the Nine studios: I’m very comfortable with the rollout of the vaccination across the – across the country. About 85% of residents across Australia have taken up the vaccine. And it’s been a significant logistical effort. There’s some providers who have put back their vaccine dates so that the residents can get flu vaccinations. We have worked with the providers to schedule them over the last 12 or 13 weeks to get the vaccines. Here is a rundown of the various reports of a lockdown flagged for Victoria. No detail has been given about whether the lockdown will affect the whole state or just greater Melbourne. The Age reports: “A source close to the government, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the confidential decision, said cabinet was set to confirm final details of the lockdown on Thursday morning before announcing the public health measures.” According to the Age, this lockdown will last at least three days, with the finer details being discussed this morning. The ABC is reporting that the cluster has grown overnight to 25 cases, with reporter Richard Willingham saying the lockdown will last at least five days. This is the problem with government leaks before the official announcement – there is confusion about how long the lockdown will last, and which areas it will affect, creating extra anxiety. There has been no announcement of a press conference yet, we’ll keep you posted when we know the details. We can expect the Victorian state government to continue to push for purpose-built quarantine facilities, given the situation that’s unfolding. Yesterday the deputy premier, James Merlino, urged that more secure quarantine facilities be designed and built, with the outbreak in Victoria originating from a hotel quarantine breach in South Australia: There is a sense of urgency about this. The best time to have had an alternative quarantine facility is 12 months ago and the next best time is now, so we are very keen to finalise those discussions with the commonwealth. There are 29 aged care facilities in Victoria which are yet to receive a single dose of vaccine from the federal government. Aged care minister Richard Colbeck was on the Nine Network this morning explaining why, as Melbourne looks about to enter another lockdown because of a Covid outbreak, sparked from a breach in Adelaide hotel quarantine: They should be done in the next few days. We’ve prioritised those. We’ve been working our way obviously across the country. There’s about 600 facilities that the commonwealth has responsibility for in Victoria. As you said, 29 of those left to be done. They were programmed to be done. They were programmed to be done this week or next week, so we’ll get those finalised as quickly as we can. We’re actually going back over other facilities, particularly in those areas of Melbourne where there has been an outbreak. The average vaccination rate across aged care in Australia is about 85%. There’s some that are lower than that so we’re going back and offering people a second chance to take up a vaccine if that’s what they’d like, given the current circumstances. Scott Morrison has also taken to reminding people how bad Covid could have been in Australia if it weren’t for the measures put in place (largely pushed by the states). Yesterday he accused the opposition of “whinging” about the vaccine rollout and said people stopped him on the street to say how happy they were: I know that Australians – because they approach me every time when I go out into regional Australia or the suburbs and cities of this country – they know here, in this country, they’re living a life during Covid like few are anywhere else in the world. This country has enjoyed safety from this pandemic and an economic recovery like few, if any, other countries in the world. Those opposite, Mr Speaker, may want to retreat into whinging and complaining and undermining the government, as we fight the virus and they focus on the politics. (Nice order of importance there too, in terms of the geographical indicators he used in that sentence.) Kristina Keneally spoke to ABC News Breakfast about that attitude this morning: Well, if we take that argument from the prime minister at face value – well, 17 outbreaks in six months – “You’ve never had it so good, what are you complaining about?” Let me tell you, the people of Melbourne today who are facing the prospect of another extended lockdown, they would disagree with the prime minister. They would say, “You got a report, prime minister, some nine months ago from Jane Halton, your handpicked expert, who told you hotel quarantine is not fit-for-purpose.” Hotels are for tourists, not for quarantine and medical purposes. We rolled it out at the beginning of the pandemic because we needed something quickly. But we now know so much more about this virus, we know it is airborne, we know hotels are not fit-for-purpose for quarantine. Jane Halton gave the prime minister multiple recommendations and he has failed to act on a single one of them. He could be, for example, taking up Victoria’s offer of the Mickleham facility and expanding that. He could be working with Queensland, with their offer to expand and work with him on a national quarantine system in that state. He could be looking at Bladin Point in the Northern Territory. Yet this is a prime minister who thinks that this is not his problem. He wants to shove everything onto the states – everything is someone else’s responsibility, and nothing is his fault. In a national pandemic, and an international pandemic, that is simply not good enough from our prime minister. Looking to some other news at the moment, a significant judgment has just come out of The Hague: A court in The Hague has ordered Royal Dutch Shell to cut its global carbon emissions by 45% by the end of 2030 compared with 2019 levels, in a landmark case brought by Friends of the Earth and over 17,000 co-plaintiffs. The oil giant’s sustainability policy was found to be insufficiently “concrete” by the Dutch court in an unprecedented ruling that will have wide implications for the energy industry and other polluting multinationals. The Anglo-Dutch company was told it had a duty of care and that the level of emission reductions of Shell and its suppliers and buyers should be brought into line with the Paris climate agreement. More than a year on from the start of the pandemic, after hotel quarantine breaches in all states and with no end in sight, you have to wonder why more people aren’t screaming for purpose-built quarantine facilities. Scott Morrison has taken to saying that hotel quarantine is 99.9% effective. But, as we are seeing from one of those 0.01% of failures, which is happening to Melbourne after a breach in an Adelaide quarantine hotel, the cost on communities is very, very high. Hotel quarantine was set up in a couple of weeks in an answer to new problems. Hotels are not set up as quarantine spaces. They have shared ventilation, for starters. We have learnt more about the virus and more about the impact of airborne particles. This is not something the federal government can continue to shrug off. Meanwhile, back in 1950, John “lots of numbers” Troll has something to say about parents in the workplace: We are expecting the Victorian press conference to be held about 9.30am or so. I’m so sorry, Melbourne. We will hopefully be hearing from Victorian authorities soon. The Herald Sun has reported the possibility of a five-day lockdown is on the cards, given the number of exposure sites. That also includes Marvel Stadium – anyone sitting on level one, between rows five and 28 and level three between aisles six and 29 is considered a tier 2 contact – and must get a Covid test and isolate until results come in. (That was Sunday’s Essendon v North Melbourne game.) You may have heard a lot from Peter Dutton lately about defence spending. Daniel Hurst has taken a look at a small slither of that spend: Australia’s defence department has revealed it is spending $37m to hire private helicopters as it grapples with low availability of the trouble-plagued Taipan choppers. The move comes as defence officials concede a fault found in one of the helicopters in 2019 – when it was on its way to pick up the Australian defence force chief, Angus Campbell – could have led to “catastrophic consequences” if left unfixed. It has prompted the opposition to blast the Howard government-era acquisition of the Multi-Role Helicopters (MRH90), also known as Taipans, as “a farce from go to whoa”. Australia needs to avoid adding to a global “race to the bottom” over military ambitions in space, amid concerns that the major powers are seeking to dominate space, according to a new report. The Australian defence force is setting up a space division at the Royal Australian Air Force headquarters in Canberra early next year, with the government planning to spend $7bn on space capabilities over the next decade. The government has also launched an Australian Space Agency. Dr Cassandra Steer, a senior lecturer at the Australian National University’s college of law who specialises in space law, said space was “a critical strategic domain for Australia’s civilian and military interests” but was “increasingly congested, contested and competitive”. She said major powers were engaged in “a destabilising space arms race”, with China, Russia and the US rejecting the strategic restraint that had kept space a stable political and military domain. In a policy options paper published by the ANU’s national security college today, Steer said Australia could act as a “middle space power” and encourage responsible behaviour in space. She argued Australian leaders should “avoid inadvertently contributing to escalatory rhetoric”. That meant avoiding descriptions of space as a “warfighting domain” or a “battlespace”: Australia needs to be careful that, as it develops sovereign space capabilities, it does not accelerate a global strategic race to the bottom. Rather, Australia should focus on its ability to become an effective diplomatic space power – building on our history as a strong contributor to space technologies and arms control norms. The paper calls on the government to invest in space literacy training across the Australian public service and for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to appoint a “space ambassador” with a dedicated team to influence the space agenda internationally. While you were sleeping, US president Joe Biden ordered an intelligence investigation into the origins of the coronavirus. You can read the Guardian’s full story here: We start this morning with the news that the list of exposure sites in Victoria has grown to 70. I think we can expect further social distancing measures to be announced today in response to that – it’s a huge list. It includes a NSW western Riverina sporting club in Tooleybuc, which is near the Victorian border. A positive case attended a football match at Cohuna which the Tooleybuc club was at. Anyone who was at the Cohuna recreation reserve on Saturday 22 May between 12pm and 5pm must get a Covid test and isolate until they receive their results. NSW has already officially asked all residents to rethink any non-urgent travel to greater Melbourne or Bendigo. South Australia has gone further and shut its borders to Melbourne residents as of 6pm last night. We’ll keep across everything that happens as it does, as well as parliament and estimates.

Trump had not started his political career at the time and was well-known as the star of reality show The Apprentice. ESPN says Trump was acting on behalf of Kraft, a claim those close to the former president and the team deny.</p> <p>“This [report] is completely false,” <strong>Jason Miller</strong>, a senior adviser to Trump, told ESPN when asked about the story. “We have no idea what you’re talking about.”</p> <p>A spokesman for the Patriots also denied the allegations to ESPN. “Mr Kraft is not aware of any involvement of Trump on this topic and he did not have any other engagement with Specter or his staff,” the spokesman said via email.</p> <p>Specter was senator for Pennsylvania at the time and ran as a Democrat and Republican during his political career. He was also a personal friend of Trump. Trump himself has been on friendly terms with several prominent members of the Patriots including Kraft, head coach<strong> Bill Belichick</strong> and former quarterback <strong>Tom Brady</strong>. Both Brady and Belichick have distanced themselves from Trump recently.

The state’s Republican governor, Mike DeWine, announced the program 12 May 12 to boost lagging vaccination rates. More than 2.7 million adults registered for the money prize and more than 100,000 children ages 12 to 17 entered for the scholarship, which includes tuition, room and board, and books, the Associated Press reported. The concept seemed to work, at least initially. The number of people in Ohio age 16 and older who received their initial COVID-19 vaccine jumped 33% in the week after the state announced its million-dollar incentive lottery, according to an Associated Press analysis. But the same review also found that vaccination rates are still well below figures from earlier in April and March. Four more winners of the $1 million and a college scholarship will be announced each Wednesday for the next four weeks. Los Angeles Times journalists file lawsuit against Minnesota state patrol A Los Angeles Times reporter and photographer have filed a lawsuit against Minnesota state patrol troopers over injuries they received while covering protests over George Floyd’s murder by police last year, the Minneapolis Star-Tribune reports. One of the journalists, Molly Hennessy-Fiske, tweeted that she is seeking “information and accountability” for the state patrol “attacking us while we were covering protests a year ago.” NYT seeks ‘hard fact’ editor to oversee weddings coverage, fact-check dating claims Most media job postings don’t get much attention. But a new job listing from the Styles section of The New York Times was unusually candid. The paper is seeking a new editor for weddings coverage who is “highly skilled at hard fact editing.” “Listen,” the listing read, “If you think that the D.C. bureau or the politics desk deals with people lying to them or hiding facts, wait till you start asking someone about their dating history.” Some readers who have personally submitted wedding announcements to the Times confirmed that the fact-checking process was unusually intense (though, as others noted, not without slip-ups.) And others noted that the job listing sounded like a pretty good premise for a romantic comedy. Cate Doty, a former New York Times weddings writer, has a just-published new memoir dishing about the inside drama of the Times’ wedding section. Michigan’s Democratic secretary of state, Jocelyn Benson, was on the front lines of the protests and election disinformation fueled by Trump’s “big lie” about election fraud as the battleground state’s chief election official. In a new interview with the Associated Press, Benson warns that the ongoing disputes and conspiracy theories around the 2020 election are only the beginning of what she sees as a sustained attack on American democracy that will culminate in a renewed attack on election legitimacy in 2024. Here’s a key exchange from the full interview: AP: Across the country, we are seeing several GOP-controlled legislatures seeking to exert more control over election officials. How concerned are you that we could end up seeing more of these outside ballot reviews like in Arizona or even takeovers of local election offices? BENSON: I feel very strongly that the battles that we saw around 2020’s election ... was just the beginning of what is clearly turning out to be a multi-year, strategic, nationally coordinated, partisan assault on the vote in our country and on our democracy. And we will see another battle in the 2022 elections around that truth and around the security of the vote, around access to the vote. But it’s also all going to culminate, I believe, in an effort to try again in 2024 what those democracy deniers attempted to do in 2020 but failed. And in 2024, the bad actors, I believe, will be more coordinated, more strategic, better funded and will have the benefit of doing this work for a number of years. I’m deeply concerned about the future health of our democracy. Democrats Move to Fulfill Biden’s Election Promise on Healthcare ‘Public Option’ Two Congressional Democrats are pushing to create a “public option” for healthcare coverage to compete with private health insurance plans, and aim to introduce legislation by the end of the year, NBC News reports. The health insurance public option, a Biden campaign pledge, was “billed as a moderate alternative to rival Bernie Sanders’ plan to scrap private coverage and put all Americans in Medicare”, per NBC. There will be plenty of opposition, and the bill will be “very tough to pass”, NBC’s Sahil Kapur reports. A majority of Americans think discrimination against Asian Americans has increased over the past year, and many are concerned that incidents of violence are up as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, the Associated Press reports. Most Asian Americans feel unsafe in public because of their race at least sometimes. Only 16% of White Americans who responded to the survey described feeling unsafe in public at least sometimes because of their race, compared with 57% of Asian Americans, 63% of Black Americans, and 44% of Hispanic Americans. The nationwide poll of 1,842 adults was conducted between 20 April and 3 May. More details on the survey methodology here. Insurrection math: will enough Republicans support a 6 January commission? Will enough Republican senators break with their party to support the creation of a 9/11-style commission to investigate how a mob of Trump supporters broke into a poorly-defended Capitol building on 6 January, forcing lawmakers of both parties to flee? NBC News’ Sahil Kapur is tracking senators’ statements on the issue, and created a useful emoji infographic: Susan Collins, the Maine Republican who has come out in support of the commission, also has some proposed changes in how it would operate: Democrats fight over bill that would reform the military’s approach to sexual assault Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a New York Democrat, has made the problem of sexual assault in the military one of her key policy issues. She’s now fighting against another Democrat, Senator Jack Reed, to get a vote on her bipartisan legislation, which would change military law to take authority for deciding military sexual assault cases out of the control of military commanders. The change has attracted support from key Republicans, including Senator Joni Ernst, who has spoken out about her own experience of sexual assault. But it’s being blocked by Reed, the Democratic chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Politico reports. More context here from The Hill: In response to rising homicides, the justice department focuses on prevention This is Lois Beckett, picking up our live US politics coverage from Los Angeles. Homicides surged across the United States during the coronavirus pandemic, in what could be the worst single-year increase in killings in decades. While final national data will not be available for months, one expert estimates the country may have seen an estimated 4000 additional murders in 2020, compared with 2019. Biden’s justice department announced its new violent crime strategy today. Department officials who briefed reporters ahead of the announcement emphasized the importance of non-law enforcement prevention programs, and made clear that US attorneys across the country would not be allowed to measure their success simply in terms of how many people they locked up, rather than whether there was evidence that violence was actually falling. The officials who briefed reporters emphasized principles and rhetoric straight out of the decades of academic research on violence prevention, including the importance of focusing on the relatively tiny number of people and places responsible for the majority of fatal violence. The Guardian investigated the intense concentration of America’s gun violence problem in 2017, and explored the strategies behind the dramatic decline in murders in California’s Bay Area in 2019. That’s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Lois Beckett, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here’s where the day stands so far: Joe Biden has asked the intelligence community to “redouble” its efforts to study the origins of coronavirus. The president is requesting a follow-up report on the issue within 90 days. The request comes days after the Wall Street Journal broke the news of a previously undisclosed US intelligence report about three Wuhan researchers being hospitalized with coronavirus-like symptoms in November 2019. The report intensified speculation that the virus started spreading as a result of a laboratory accident. A shooting at a railyard in San Jose, California, left eight people dead, in addition to the shooter, who was identified as an employee of the Valley Transportation Authority. Biden has been briefed on the shooting, and vice-President Kamala Harris described it as “absolutely tragic”. US diplomats sent a letter to the state department complaining that those with “Havana syndrome” are being denied proper care, according to NBC News. The diplomats are calling for the Biden administration to take the condition more seriously, NBC reported. Senate Republicans will soon propose a counteroffer in the ongoing negotiations over an infrastructure package. The Republican negotiators are expected to propose spending $1tn on an infrastructure bill, which is still far less than the $1.7tn that Biden called for last week, when he issued his own counteroffer. Karine Jean-Pierre made history as the first openly gay person and the second Black woman to ever hold a White House briefing. The principal deputy White House press secretary held her first formal briefing with reporters this afternoon. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. “Hi, everybody! Welcome!” So, with a rustle of papers, began a new chapter in the White House briefing room on Wednesday when Karine Jean-Pierre became the first openly gay person to address reporters on behalf of the US president. She was also the first Black woman to do so since Judy Smith, a deputy press secretary for President George H W Bush – and inspiration for Olivia Pope in the TV drama Scandal – stood at the podium some 30 years ago. The briefing was widely seen as an audition by Jean-Pierre, who is currently principal deputy press secretary, for the top job of presidential spokesperson. The incumbent, Jen Psaki, who has been briefing almost daily, said recently she intends to leave the post after a year. Did Jean-Pierre pass the audition? Joe Biden will be the ultimate judge of that but it would fair to say that she observed the first rule for press secretaries: do no harm. Her replies were noncommittal, uncontroversial and not likely to generate unwanted headlines. Vice-President Kamala Harris, a former senator of California, described today’s mass shooting in San Jose as “absolutely tragic”. Speaking at the beginning of a meeting with members of Congress on investing in broadband infrastructure, Harris noted she has family members who live in San Jose and has worked with the mayor and police department there. “My prayers and my thoughts are with all of those families affected,” Harris told reporters. Joe Biden has been briefed on the mass shooting today at a railyard in San Jose, California, the White House said in a statement to the press pool. “The President has been briefed on the mass shooting and the tragic loss of life in San Jose by his Homeland Security Advisor, Liz Sherwood-Randall. The White House continues to monitor the situation and remains in close contact with local officials to offer any assistance as needed,” the statement said. Local authorities said eight people were killed in the attack, in addition to the shooter, who was identified as an employee of the Valley Transportation Authority. Multiple other people were injured in the shooting, and a police spokesperson warned the death toll could still rise. US diplomats and other officials experiencing symptoms that appear to be consistent with the unexplained brain injury known as Havana Syndrome have written a letter to the US state department saying those affected are being denied appropriate care. NBC News, which obtained the letter, reports that staffers have claimed that the Biden administration has continued to “invalidate our injuries and experiences,” and they are calling for the condition to be treated more seriously. Last month, The New York Times reported that there had been more than 130 incidents of Havana syndrome among US diplomats, spies and defence officials, some of them very recently. The Times said three CIA officers had reported serious symptoms since December, following overseas assignments. The Guardian’s world affairs editor, Julian Borger, reported at the time: In December, the National Academy of Sciences published a report saying that the brain injuries suffered by US government employees in Cuba and China were most likely the result of some form of directed energy. Cheryl Rofer, a former chemist at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, has questioned the study’s conclusions, and the claim by victims and some experts that some kind of microwave weapon developed by an adversary is responsible for Havana syndrome. ‘The evidence for microwave effects of the type categorized as Havana syndrome is exceedingly weak,’ Rofer wrote in Foreign Policy. Republican Senator Tim Scott said Congress must reach a deal on the policing reform bill next month, as bipartisan negotiations over the legislation continue. “It’s June or bust,” Scott told a PBS Newshour reporter. “We’ve got three weeks in June to get this done.” Scott is one of three lawmakers, along with Democratic congresswoman Karen Bass and Democratic Senator Cory Booker, who are involved in the negotiations over the bill. Joe Biden had originally said he hoped to sign the bill by the one-year anniversary of the death of George Floyd, the Black man who was murdered by a white Minneapolis police officer last May. But that anniversary came and went yesterday without a final deal on the policing bill. Biden met yesterday with some of Floyd’s family members, who urged Congress to pass the legislation as quickly as possible. Speaking to reporters this afternoon, deputy White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said policing reform remains a “top priority” for the president. “He is going to continue to work on this today, tomorrow and every day,” Jean-Pierre said. President Joe Biden has paid tribute to former Virginia Republican senator John Warner who died on Tuesday aged 94, saying he “lived an extraordinary life of service and accomplishment”. In a statement issued Wednesday, Biden said: “I had the privilege of serving alongside John in the Senate for three decades. The John Warner I knew was guided by two things: his conscience and our Constitution. And, when acting in accordance with both, he neither wavered in his convictions nor was concerned with the consequences.” He added: “When told that if he voted in a way that was not in line with his party’s position—as he did numerous times on issues of rational gun policy, women’s rights, and judicial nominees—that “people would say,” his favorite rejoinder was, “Let ‘em say it.” “Indeed, that was his response when, in one of the great honors of my career, he crossed party lines to support me in the 2020 election.” Biden ended the statement by saying “our hearts and prayers are with his family”. The White House is reportedly finalizing plans for president Joe Biden to meet with Queen Elizabeth II during his first trip abroad next month, according to CNN. “This face-to-face greeting, during which Biden would be joined by first lady Jill Biden, is expected to take place before the president leaves the United Kingdom following the Group of 7 summit,” CNN reported, citing an unnamed US official. The official reportedly said the White House and Buckingham Palace were finalizing details on Wednesday, and an announcement was expected in the coming days. The Queen, who is 95 years-old and is the world’s longest-reigning monarch, has met every US president since Harry Truman, with the exception of Lyndon Johnson. If the meeting goes ahead, Biden would be the 13th American president she has met. Karine Jean-Pierre indicated the Biden administration will also continue to press the World Health Organization to gather information on the origins of coronavirus. “We’ve been very clear with the WHO to continue to get to the bottom of this,” the deputy press secretary said. “We’re going to continue working with the WHO.” Jean-Pierre noted Joe Biden brought the US back into the WHO after Donald Trump withdrew from the organization, and she said the president made that decision partly to hold the group accountable when it comes to investigating the origins of coronavirus. The White House press briefing has now concluded. A reporter pressed Karine Jean-Pierre on what has changed recently to make Joe Biden call for a 90-day intelligence community review of the potential origins of coronavirus. The New York Times reporter noted that Jean-Pierre’s boss, press secretary Jen Psaki, had been emphasizing the World Health Organization’s investigation (rather than a domestic investigation) as recently as last week. Jean-Pierre insisted nothing has changed in recent days, telling reporters, “We don’t speak about everything under review.” Biden’s announcement came days after the Wall Street Journal broke news of a previously undisclosed US intelligence report about three Wuhan researchers being hospitalized with coronavirus-like symptoms in November 2019, intensifying speculation that the virus spread as the result of a lab accident. Asked if the US intelligence community has ruled out the possibility of a deliberate release of coronavirus, Karine Jean-Pierre replied, “We haven’t ruled out anything yet.” The deputy White House press secretary repeatedly emphasized that the administration will have more information to offer on the investigation into the origins of coronavirus once the 90-day intelligence community review is completed. Jean-Pierre repeatedly criticized China for not being transparent with its information on the origins of the virus, echoing comments from other senior administration officials and international leaders. Deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked about the White House’s response to the shooting this morning at a railyard in San Jose, California. “Our hearts go out to the victims and their families,” Jean-Pierre said. “There is an ongoing investigation, as we all know. We will continue to stay in close contact with them and offer any assistance as needed.” San Jose officials have just confirmed that eight people died in the shooting, in addition to the shooter, who reportedly died by suicide after the attack. A police spokesperson warned that the number of victims could change, as multiple other people were injured in the attack. One reporter asked Karine Jean-Pierre to reflect on her history-making appearance at the White House briefing room podium today. “It’s a real honor to just be standing here today. I appreciate the historic nature” of this moment, the deputy White House press secretary said. But Jean-Pierre emphasized that this administration is not about any one person and is instead focused on the collective efforts to improve American lives. She also promised to be “truthful” and “transparent” while speaking to the press. “Clearly, the president believes representation matters, and I appreciate him giving me this opportunity,” Jean-Pierre said. No surprise here: the first questions at the White House briefing focused on Joe Biden’s announcement that he is asking the intelligence community to “redouble” efforts to study the origins of coronavirus. Deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre would not say whether the report will be made public when it is completed. “We’ll have more to share after the 90 days,” Jean-Pierre said, referring to the deadline set by the president for completing the report. Deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre is now holding her first formal briefing with reporters in the White House briefing room. Jean-Pierre’s appearance at the briefing room podium makes her just the second Black woman to hold a White House briefing, after Judy Smith did so 30 years ago while serving in George HW Bush’s administration. Jean-Pierre has been mentioned as a potential successor to press secretary Jen Psaki, who has said she only wants to stay in the job for one year. if Jean-Pierre were selected to succeed Psaki, she would be the first Black woman to serve as White House press secretary. Testifying before a Senate appropriations subcommittee today, Dr Anthony Fauci reiterated that he is “very much in favor” of further investigation into the origins of coronavirus. Fauci, the president’s chief medical adviser, and some of his colleagues from the National Institutes of Health said they still believed coronavirus most likely came about from human contact with an infected animal. Fauci told Republican Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith, “I feel the likelihood is still high that this is a natural occurrence, but since you cannot know 100% whether it is or is not -- other possibilities exist -- and for that reason, I and my colleagues have been saying that we are very much in favor of a further investigation.” Here’s where the day stands so far: Joe Biden has asked the intelligence community to “redouble” its efforts to study the origins of coronavirus. The president is requesting a follow-up report on the issue within 90 days. The request comes days after the Wall Street Journal broke the news of a previously undisclosed US intelligence report about three Wuhan researchers being hospitalized with coronavirus-like symptoms in November 2019. The report intensified speculation that the virus started spreading as a result of a laboratory accident. A shooting at a railyard in San Jose, California, left multiple people dead. Authorities said the shooting resulted in “multiple injuries and multiple fatalities,” and the shooter is now dead. The victims include Valley Transportation Authority employees. Senate Republicans will soon propose a counteroffer in the ongoing negotiations over an infrastructure package. The Republican negotiators are expected to propose spending $1 trillion on an infrastructure bill, which is still far less than the $1.7 trillion that Biden called for last week, when he issued his own counteroffer. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Joe Biden’s request to intensify the investigation into the origins of coronavirus comes days after the Wall Street Journal reported on a previously undisclosed US intelligence report about three Wuhan researchers being hospitalized with coronavirus-like symptoms in November 2019. The report intensified speculation that coronavirus may have spread as a result of a laboratory accident in China. The Journal reported: Three researchers from China’s Wuhan Institute of Virology became sick enough in November 2019 that they sought hospital care, according to a previously undisclosed U.S. intelligence report that could add weight to growing calls for a fuller probe of whether the Covid-19 virus may have escaped from the laboratory. The details of the reporting go beyond a State Department fact sheet, issued during the final days of the Trump administration, which said that several researchers at the lab, a center for the study of coronaviruses and other pathogens, became sick in autumn 2019 ‘with symptoms consistent with both Covid-19 and common seasonal illness.’ ... Current and former officials familiar with the intelligence about the lab researchers expressed differing views about the strength of the supporting evidence for the assessment. One person said that it was provided by an international partner and was potentially significant but still in need of further investigation and additional corroboration. Another person described the intelligence as stronger. ‘The information that we had coming from the various sources was of exquisite quality. It was very precise. What it didn’t tell you was exactly why they got sick,’ he said, referring to the researchers. Joe Biden has asked the US intelligence community to “redouble” its efforts to study the origins of coronavirus. The president said he received a report earlier this month with the “most up-to-date analysis of the origins of COVID-19,” and he has asked for additional follow-up within 90 days. Biden noted that the US intelligence community has not yet coalesced around a common theory as to whether coronavirus came about from human contact with an infected animal or from a laboratory accident. “I have now asked the Intelligence Community to redouble their efforts to collect and analyze information that could bring us closer to a definitive conclusion, and to report back to me in 90 days. As part of that report, I have asked for areas of further inquiry that may be required, including specific questions for China,” Biden said. The president said he has also asked the intelligence community to keep Congress apprised of its work on this matter. “The United States will also keep working with like-minded partners around the world to press China to participate in a full, transparent, evidence-based international investigation and to provide access to all relevant data and evidence,” Biden said. Deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre will soon hold her first formal briefing in the White House briefing room. Jean-Pierre is only the second Black woman to lead a briefing in the briefing room, after Judy Smith did so 30 years ago while serving in George HW Bush’s administration. Symone Sanders, who serves as chief spokesperson for Vice-President Kamala Harris, congratulated Jean-Pierre on the significant moment. “I will be raising my coffee cup during the WH press briefing in celebration of representation, aptitude and brilliance,” Sanders said on Twitter. “The ancestors are proud.” The suspect in the San Jose shooting died by suicide, according to CBS News. It’s still unclear how many people were killed in the attack, although a sheriff’s office spokesperson confirmed there were “multiple fatalities”. Guardian staff and agencies report: The San Jose shooting took place at a light rail facility that is nextdoor to the Santa Clara county sheriff’s department and across a freeway from the airport. The facility is a transit control center that stores trains and has a maintenance yard. A spokesperson for the Valley Transportation Authority did not immediately respond to multiple requests for comment. A shooting at a railyard in San Jose, California, has left multiple people dead and several others injured, a spokesperson for the Santa Clara County sheriff’s office said. The spokesperson would not say the exact number of victims, but he confirmed to reporters that there were “multiple injuries and multiple fatalities” from the shooting. The victims include Valley Transportation Authority employees. The mayor of San Jose, Sam Liccardo, previously said on Twitter that the shooter is now dead and the facility has been evacuated. He said more information would be made available in about 30 minutes. California Governor Gavin Newsom also said in a tweet that he is closely monitoring the situation and remains in contact with local law enforcement officials. Second gentleman Douglas Emhoff will travel tomorrow to Albuquerque, New Mexico, the White House has just announced. According to Politico, the vice-president’s husband is traveling to the state to campaign for Melanie Stansbury, the Democratic congressional candidate who is running to fill Interior Secretary Deb Haaland’s seat in the House. Politico reports: The second gentleman will be heading to New Mexico to campaign with Democratic congressional candidate Melanie Stansbury ahead of the special election on Tuesday, according to two sources with knowledge of the planning. An administration official says the event will take place on Thursday. ... This won’t be the first political event for Emhoff who joined DNC Chair Jaime Harrison in March for the latter’s first virtual fundraiser. It is, however, his first campaign event since the November election. Emhoff is no stranger to the trail. He was a mainstay of Vice President Kamala Harris’ primary bid and did solo events during the general election after she joined the Biden ticket. Joe Biden endorsed Stansbury in a statement yesterday, saying she has “the grit and determination to deliver real results for all New Mexicans”. The seat is considered safely Democratic, given that Biden won it by 23 points in November. New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft has denied allegations he and Donald Trump attempted to pay a senator money in order to drop an investigation into a cheating scandal involving the team. According to a report published on Wednesday by ESPN, Trump met with late senator Arlen Specter in 2008 and offered him “money in Palm Beach” if he dropped his investigation into the Spygate scandal, in which the Patriots were disciplined by the NFL for filming a rival team’s coaching signals. Trump had not started his political career at the time and was well-known as the star of reality show The Apprentice. ESPN says Trump was acting on behalf of Kraft, a claim those close to the former president and the team deny. “This [report] is completely false,” Jason Miller, a senior adviser to Trump, told ESPN when asked about the story. “We have no idea what you’re talking about.” A spokesman for the Patriots also denied the allegations to ESPN. “Mr Kraft is not aware of any involvement of Trump on this topic and he did not have any other engagement with Specter or his staff,” the spokesman said via email. Specter was senator for Pennsylvania at the time and ran as a Democrat and Republican during his political career. He was also a personal friend of Trump. Trump himself has been on friendly terms with several prominent members of the Patriots including Kraft, head coach Bill Belichick and former quarterback Tom Brady. Both Brady and Belichick have distanced themselves from Trump recently. In January, following the US Capitol invasion, Belichick turned down Trump’s offer of the presidential medal of freedom. Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer said the flags around the Senate side of the US Capitol will be lowered to half-staff in honor of the late senator John Warner, who died last night at the age of 94. “On behalf of the Senate, I want to express our condolences to his family and his friends, and our gratitude for amazing service to America throughout his life,” the Democratic leader said in a floor speech moments ago. Virginia Governor Ralph Northam described the late senator John Warner as “the best of what public service and elected leadership should be”. “Virginia, and America, have lost a giant,” the Democratic governor said in a statement. “As a sailor, a senator, a statesman, and a gentleman, former U.S. Senator John Warner spent his life in public service.” Northam offered his prayers to Warner’s family members as they mourn his death at the age of 94. “John helped build up his political party and always remained an independent voice. He used that voice in the Senate to forge bipartisan compromise, knowing how and when to reach across the aisle. And he always put Virginia first,” Northam said. “Our prayers for comfort go out to his wife Jeanne, his three children, grandchildren, scores of friends, and all those who loved him.” John Warner, the longtime former Republican senator of Virginia who clashed with George W Bush over the Iraq War, has died of heart failure at 94. Reuters reports: Warner died late on Tuesday, with his wife and daughter at his side, his chief of staff, Susan Magill, said in an email to family and friends, according to a Politico report on Wednesday. The Washington Post said he died in Alexandria, Virginia. Warner was an influential voice in Congress on military policy and served in the US Senate for five terms from 1979 to 2009. He was also the sixth husband of the actor Elizabeth Taylor. A former chairman of the Senate armed services committee, Warner openly criticized President George W Bush’s handling of the Iraq war and called on him in 2007 to begin withdrawing US troops from Iraq. The decision put Warner in the center of a growing debate in Congress over the conflict. Warner spent months trying to develop an approach to US policy in Iraq that was supported by Republicans and Democrats. Lawmakers of both parties responded to the news of Warner’s death by offering admiring condolence messages to the his family. Current Virginia Senator Mark Warner, who was not related to the late senator, said of him, “John Warner was a consummate statesman and a public servant who always put Virginia before politics; who put the nation’s security before partisanship; who put the country’s needs above his own.” When deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre holds her first formal White House briefing this afternoon, she will be only the second Black woman to ever do so, according to a CBS News reporter. Alexandra Villarreal reports on how white male minority rule has overtaken US politics: From county officials and sheriffs to governors and senators, white male minority rule pervades politics in the United States, according to a new report published on Wednesday. White men represent 30% of the population but 62% of officeholders, dominating both chambers of Congress, 42 state legislatures and statewide roles across the nation, the analysis shows. By contrast, women and people of color constitute 51% and 40% of the US population respectively, but just 31% and 13% of officeholders, according to the research by the Reflective Democracy Campaign, shared exclusively with the Guardian. “I think if we saw these numbers in another country, we would say there is something very wrong with that political system,” said Brenda Choresi Carter, the campaign’s director. “We would say, ‘how could that possibly be a democratic system with that kind of demographic mismatch?’” Read Alexandra’s full report here: Today will also mark an important first at the White House. Principal deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre will be doing her first full briefing from the briefing room podium this afternoon. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Twitter, “Today is a big day in the press office and @WhiteHouse. My partner in truth--@KJP46 is doing her first full briefing from the podium today making history in her own right. But doing her real justice means also recognizing her talent, her brilliance and her wonderful spirit.” Jean-Pierre has done briefings with reporters aboard Air Force One before, usually as the president flies across the country promoting his American Rescue Plan or American Jobs Plan. But this will be her first official appearance at the briefing room podium. Reporters will be watching Jean-Pierre closely because she has been suggested as a potential successor to Psaki, who has indicated she only wants to serve as press secretary for one year. If Jean-Pierre did get the job, she would be the first Black woman to hold the post. Joe Biden has reportedly signaled to Republican senators working on infrastructure negotiations that he would be willing to accept a $1 trillion counteroffer. CNN reports: Two key GOP negotiators -- Sens. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and Roger Wicker of Mississippi -- both indicated on Tuesday that Biden has signaled openness to that price tag, a reason why they plan to make a counteroffer around that amount on Thursday, even as there are still sharp disagreements on how to pay for the massive proposal. ‘The President indicated he would accept that number,’ Wicker told CNN, referring to $1 trillion. The upcoming Senate GOP offer is a sign that negotiations with the White House aren’t over yet even as talks are teetering on the edge ahead of a Memorial Day deadline. GOP negotiators met Tuesday behind closed doors, telling reporters that they planned to offer a new infrastructure proposal Thursday that will approach $1 trillion in part because they believe the two sides could find agreement there. ‘He used that figure with us, yes,’ Capito said when asked if Biden showed a willingness to accept a $1 trillion proposal, adding that the President also suggested a package of investments over an eight-year time frame. ‘We’re responding to what he proposed.’ The White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, would not confirm yesterday whether Biden had signaled he would be comfortable with $1 trillion as the topline number for the infrastructure package. “I’m not going to read any more specifics of a private conversation,” Psaki told reporters. “But I will just reiterate that the proposal put forward last Friday, that we put out transparently to all of you, that brought the price tag down by $550 billion was directed, signed off on by the president of the United States.” Greetings from Washington, live blog readers. Senate Republicans are expected to propose a counteroffer tomorrow in the ongoing negotiations over an infrastructure package, and their plan is expected to cost around $1 trillion. “We’re going to hit a figure very close to what the president said he would accept, and it will end up being the most substantial infrastructure bill ever enacted by the federal government,” Republican Senator Roger Wicker told reporters yesterday. “And if the president gets to make the decision, he will accept it.” The new offer comes almost a week after Joe Biden proposed a smaller infrastructure bill than he had originally proposed, lowering the overall cost of his plan from $2.25 trillion to $1.7 trillion. Republicans complained that price tag was still too high for them, but Democrats have insisted the plan must include items like massive investments in green energy, which the Republican plans have largely omitted. If Biden does not like Republicans’ latest offer, Democrats could still try to pass an infrastructure bill using reconciliation, thus avoiding a Senate filibuster. But Democrats’ key 50th Senate vote, Joe Manchin, may not be on board for that, so all eyes will be on the Republicans’ as they propose their counteroffer. The blog will have more details on the Republican offer coming up, so stay tuned.","charCount":"38676","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/lois-beckett\">Lois Beckett</a> in Los Angeles (now) and <a href=\"profile/joan-greve\">Joan E Greve</a> (earlier)"},{"headline":"Victoria Covid public exposure sites: full list of Melbourne venues and Vic coronavirus hotspots and case locations","standfirst":"<p>Here are the current coronavirus hotspots and Covid-19 exposure sites in Victoria and Melbourne, and what to do if you’ve visited them</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/may/27/covid-restrictions-victoria-new-greater-melbourne-and-vic-coronavirus-rules-explained\">Victoria’s Covid restrictions explained</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2021/may/27/coronavirus-australia-live-updates-victoria-braces-for-potential-lockdown-to-contain-melbourne-outbreak-covid-cases-restrictions-scott-morrison-brittany-higgins-james-merlino-nsw-border-closure-afl-crowds-exposure-sites-mcg\">Follow LIVE coronavirus updates on Thursday: Victoria braces for potential lockdown to contain Melbourne cases</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2018/may/15/the-guardian-app?CMP=cvau_sfl\">Download the free Guardian app</a></li></ul>","trailText":"Here are the current coronavirus hotspots and Covid-19 exposure sites in Victoria and Melbourne, and what to do if you’ve visited themVictoria’s Covid restrictions explained","byline":"Guardian staff","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bcd3c4def6dd56c58e9ef11bb7a413312d8bf9c6\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bcd3c4def6dd56c58e9ef11bb7a413312d8bf9c6/0_260_4854_2913/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Check our full list of Covid-19 exposure sites in Victoria and Melbourne for Covid hotspots and coronavirus case locations.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Check our full list of Covid-19 public exposure sites in Victoria and Melbourne for Covid hotspots and coronavirus case locations.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Ross/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure>","body":"<p>Authorities have released a list of public exposure sites in Melbourne and Victoria visited by a confirmed case of Covid-19.</p> \n<p>Here are the current coronavirus hotspots and Covid exposure sites, and what to do if you’ve visited them</p> \n<h2><strong>List of public exposure sites in Victoria</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom element--showcase\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2021/01/nsw-covid-hotspots/table4\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>More detailed information is available at the <a href=\"https://www.dhhs.vic.gov.au/case-locations-and-outbreaks#case-alerts--public-exposure-sites\">Department of Health and Human Services website</a>.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><em>Due to the unprecedented and ongoing nature of the coronavirus outbreak, this article is being regularly updated to ensure that it reflects the current situation at the date of publication.

United were beaten 11-10 in a remarkable penalty shootout that featured 21 converted spot-kicks before the goalkeeper David de Gea’s final attempt was saved by his opposite number Gerónimo Rulli. Rulli’s stop ensured United’s four-year wait for silverware continues and brought Villarreal their first trophy from their first major final. It also made Unai Emery the most decorated coach in the competition with four triumphs. Solskjaer admitted his side had fallen short against a team that finished seventh in La Liga this season, but now enter the Champions League as the Europa League winners. “We didn’t turn up, we didn’t play as well as we can,” the United manager said. “We started all right; they got the goal with their only shot on target, and we’re disappointed to concede again on a set-piece. “We pushed, we pressed, we got the goal, but after that we couldn’t control the game. They made it hard for us. We didn’t create enough big chances. Now is not the time to discuss what I might have done differently, but when you go home without a trophy you haven’t done everything right.” Having finished runners-up in both the Premier League and Europa League, the United manager accepted the season can not be considered a success. He added: “No, it’s not a successful season of course. That’s the fine margins in football. Sometimes one kick can decide if a season is successful or not. There has been improvement, yes, we were second in the league and nobody really expected that after the start we had and the lack of pre-season. “The boys have been really good but just came up short tonight on penalties. Trophies matter and that’s what matters at this club, so no (it has not been a successful season).” Solskjaer revealed he considered replacing De Gea for the penalty shootout with the Spanish goalkeeper having failed to save the last 35 spot-kicks he has faced, the Europa League final included. “You go through every scenario,” he said. “It had crossed my mind in the buildup to the game but we were confident in David. Anything can happen in a penalty shootout and I went with the keeper who had played the whole game.” The United manager also defended his lack of substitutions during the match. Emery switched five players in normal time while Solskjaer took until the 100th minute before making his first change when replacing Mason Greenwood with Fred. He explained: “We had players out there, like Mason and Marcus (Rashford) who are match-winners. Bruno (Fernandes) and Edinson (Cavani) can create anything, Scott McTominay was the best player on the pitch and we had Paul (Pogba). It was difficult to make that change when Fred had been injured for a week. But we couldn’t create enough chances.

within 90 days</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The <strong>US</strong> president <strong>Joe Biden</strong> has ordered US intelligence agencies to report to him in the next three months on whether the coronavirus first emerged in <strong>China</strong> from an animal source or from a laboratory accident, AFP reports.</p> \n  <p>Agencies should “redouble their efforts to collect and analyse information that could bring us closer to a definitive conclusion, and to report back to me in 90 days,” Biden said in a statement released by the White House on Wednesday.</p> \n  <p>According to Biden, agencies are currently split over the two possible sources for the virus that swept the planet over the past year, killing more than 3.4 million people - a figure experts say is undoubtedly an underestimate.</p> \n  <p>Biden’s order signals an escalation in mounting controversy over how the virus first emerged - through animal contact at a market in <strong>Wuhan </strong>or through release of the virus from a highly secure research laboratory in the same city.</p> \n  <p>The answer has immense implications both for China, which says it is not responsible for the pandemic, and for the United States.</p> \n  <p>The US <strong>National Institutes of Health</strong> (NIH) previously funded bat coronavirus research in Wuhan, but has denied supporting “gain of function” experiments that involve modifying a virus so that it becomes more transmissible to humans.</p> \n  <p>The grant was terminated last year by the administration of former president Donald Trump.</p> \n  <p>The lab theory has been used by opposition Republicans to attack top US scientists, including the NIH’s <strong>Dr</strong> <strong>Anthony Fauci</strong>, and Beijing, which strongly denies the claims.</p> \n  <p>Biden said that in March he asked for a report on the origins of the virus, including “whether it emerged from human contact with an infected animal or from a laboratory accident.”</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>As of today, the US intelligence community has ‘coalesced around two likely scenarios’ but has not reached a definitive conclusion on this question.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>White House deputy press secretary <strong>Karine Jean-Pierre</strong> told reporters Biden was informed by the intelligence community of their assessment about a month ago, but it was classified information until now.</p> \n  <p>Asked about the government’s position on whether the virus was deliberately engineered to become a bioweapon, she said: “We haven’t ruled out anything yet.”</p> \n  <p>The lab leak theory has angered China, with foreign ministry spokesman <strong>Zhao</strong> <strong>Lijian</strong> on Wednesday hitting out and accusing Washington of “spreading conspiracy theories and disinformation.”<br></p> \n  <p>Nevertheless, the idea is gaining increasing traction in the US, where it was initially fuelled by Trump and his aides and dismissed by many as a political talking point.</p> \n  <p>Citing a US intelligence report, The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that a trio from the <strong>Wuhan Institute of Virology</strong> were <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/intelligence-on-sick-staff-at-wuhan-lab-fuels-debate-on-covid-19-origin-11621796228\">hospitalised with a seasonal illness in November 2019</a>, a month before Beijing disclosed the existence of a mysterious pneumonia outbreak.</p> \n  <p>The natural origin hypothesis holds the virus emerged in bats then passed to humans, likely via an intermediary species.</p> \n  <p>This theory was widely accepted at the start of the pandemic, but as time has worn on, scientists have not found a virus in either bats or another animal that matches the genetic signature of SARS-CoV-2.</p> \n  <p>This wasn’t the case for SARS and MERS, earlier coronaviruses that crossed to humans and were traced back to civets and camels relatively quickly.</p> \n  <p>The USand other countries have called for a more in-depth probe into the pandemic’s origins, after a report by an international team sent by the <strong>World Health Organization</strong> to China earlier this year proved inconclusive.</p> \n  <p>And calls from independent scientists for more transparency are also growing.</p> \n  <p>“We must take hypotheses about both natural and laboratory spillovers seriously until we have sufficient data,” a group of researchers from top US universities wrote in a letter published by leading journal Science in mid-May.</p>

Marschalek told the FT that when virus genes are in the nucleus they can create “some problems”.</p> \n  <p>He believes there is a “way out” if the vaccine developers can adapt the sequence of the spike protein to prevent splicing. </p> \n  <p>You can read the FT’s exclusive story <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f76eb802-ec05-4461-9956-b250115d0577\">here</a>. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-05-26T18:59:13.031Z\">at 7.59pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-60ae8d3d8f088d8c3178a059\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-05-26T18:03:27.420Z\">7.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>France’s</strong> average daily number of new Covid-19 cases fell to its lowest level since mid-September while the number of people being treated for the virus in hospital continued to decline, official data showed on Wednesday.</p> \n  <p>The daily figure, averaged out over seven days, fell below 10,000, down from a 2021 high of over 42,000 in mid-April.</p> \n  <p>New confirmed infections rose by 12,646 over the past 24 hours to a cumulative 5.62 million since the start of the pandemic, a slower pace of growth than a week ago, when they rose by 19,000.

earlier post</a>), <strong>Prof Ravi Gupta</strong>, of Cambridge University, said however that the B.1.617.2 variant is less resistant to antibodies than the variant first identified in South Africa</p> \n  <p>There are also biological changes in the virus that appear to help it to infected cells and transmit quicker between cells.</p> \n  <p>That, he said, chimes with data from Public Health England showing that a single dose of a Covid jab is not very effective at preventing infection with the India variant – although protection is much better after a second dose.</p> \n  <p>“In populations where there is partial immunity either from previous infection or low levels of antibody, then the virus will have that nice sweet spot of an advantage of immune evasion plus greater transmission,” he said, noting that he was surprised at the discovery of a cluster of infections among healthcare workers in India who had been fully vaccinated.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The vaccines are still doing their job, they are still protecting you from severe disease.

Our latest Covid stories are at the link below: See all our coronavirus coverage A controversial national cabinet decision to fast track vaccines for Australians approved to travel overseas should be strengthened to make vaccination mandatory prior to departure, the Australian Medical Association has said. The cabinet decision, aimed at protecting both Australians while overseas and the quarantine system from leaks upon their return, was quietly introduced on a voluntary basis last Thursday. It means Australians under 50, with valid exit exemptions, are now able to receive Pfizer vaccines regardless of the phase they fall under in Australia’s troubled rollout: The US president Joe Biden has ordered US intelligence agencies to report to him in the next three months on whether the coronavirus first emerged in China from an animal source or from a laboratory accident, AFP reports. Agencies should “redouble their efforts to collect and analyse information that could bring us closer to a definitive conclusion, and to report back to me in 90 days,” Biden said in a statement released by the White House on Wednesday. According to Biden, agencies are currently split over the two possible sources for the virus that swept the planet over the past year, killing more than 3.4 million people - a figure experts say is undoubtedly an underestimate. Biden’s order signals an escalation in mounting controversy over how the virus first emerged - through animal contact at a market in Wuhan or through release of the virus from a highly secure research laboratory in the same city. The answer has immense implications both for China, which says it is not responsible for the pandemic, and for the United States. The US National Institutes of Health (NIH) previously funded bat coronavirus research in Wuhan, but has denied supporting “gain of function” experiments that involve modifying a virus so that it becomes more transmissible to humans. The grant was terminated last year by the administration of former president Donald Trump. The lab theory has been used by opposition Republicans to attack top US scientists, including the NIH’s Dr Anthony Fauci, and Beijing, which strongly denies the claims. Biden said that in March he asked for a report on the origins of the virus, including “whether it emerged from human contact with an infected animal or from a laboratory accident.” As of today, the US intelligence community has ‘coalesced around two likely scenarios’ but has not reached a definitive conclusion on this question. White House deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Biden was informed by the intelligence community of their assessment about a month ago, but it was classified information until now. Asked about the government’s position on whether the virus was deliberately engineered to become a bioweapon, she said: “We haven’t ruled out anything yet.” The lab leak theory has angered China, with foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian on Wednesday hitting out and accusing Washington of “spreading conspiracy theories and disinformation.” Nevertheless, the idea is gaining increasing traction in the US, where it was initially fuelled by Trump and his aides and dismissed by many as a political talking point. Citing a US intelligence report, The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that a trio from the Wuhan Institute of Virology were hospitalised with a seasonal illness in November 2019, a month before Beijing disclosed the existence of a mysterious pneumonia outbreak. The natural origin hypothesis holds the virus emerged in bats then passed to humans, likely via an intermediary species. This theory was widely accepted at the start of the pandemic, but as time has worn on, scientists have not found a virus in either bats or another animal that matches the genetic signature of SARS-CoV-2. This wasn’t the case for SARS and MERS, earlier coronaviruses that crossed to humans and were traced back to civets and camels relatively quickly. The USand other countries have called for a more in-depth probe into the pandemic’s origins, after a report by an international team sent by the World Health Organization to China earlier this year proved inconclusive. And calls from independent scientists for more transparency are also growing. “We must take hypotheses about both natural and laboratory spillovers seriously until we have sufficient data,” a group of researchers from top US universities wrote in a letter published by leading journal Science in mid-May. In case you missed it (!), Dominic Cummings, the former chief aide to the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, made some explosive claims today, including that Johnson is unfit to be prime minister after presiding over a chaotic and incompetent pandemic response that caused many thousands of unnecessary deaths. In a seven-hour hearing before MPs in Westminster, Cummings gave a damning account of the government’s approach, laying much of the blame on Johnson and health secretary Matt Hancock. The ousted aide said the prime minister had failed to grasp the gravity of the situation and held out against lockdowns meaning “tens of thousands of people died who didn’t need to die”. He portrayed Johnson as obsessed with the media and making constant U-turns “like a shopping trolley smashing from one side of the aisle to the other”. Asked whether the prime minister was a fit and proper person to lead the country through the pandemic, Cummings replied simply: “No.” Apologising for what he said were his own failings, he added: The truth is that senior ministers, senior officials, senior advisers like me fell disastrously short of the standards that the public has a right to expect of its government in a crisis like this. Here is the full story from my colleagues Heather Stewart and Peter Walker: And here is a summary of all the key moments from Cummings’s excoriating attack: Brazilian senators conducting a high-profile inquiry into president Jair Bolsonaro’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic on Wednesday voted to recall the current and former health ministers for more testimony, as well as summon nine state governors for the first time, Reuters reports. Senators are grilling government officials and other stakeholders to seek answers as to why Brazil has become the country with the world’s second-highest Covid-19 death toll, with more than 450,000 fatalities. The probe may pose a headache for Bolsonaro, who has long sought to play down the severity of the virus, ahead of next year’s presidential election. The current health minister Marcelo Queiroga and his predecessor, Eduardo Pazuello, an active-duty army general, will both be called to testify again in front of the Senate panel. Former presidential adviser Arthur Weintraub and businessman Carlos Wizard Martins, who was briefly attached to the Health Ministry, will also be called. In addition, nine state governors are due to explain irregularities in Covid-19 spending in their states. Wilson Witzel, the former governor of Rio de Janeiro, was impeached in April over alleged graft in the purchase of medical supplies and services to fight the Covid-19 outbreak. An eight-week decline in Spain’s coronavirus infection rate has begun to tail off, the health minister Carolina Darias said on Wednesday, pointing to younger people who are less likely to be vaccinated as the cause. “The stagnation of the decline we have been seeing is heavily influenced by the epidemic in population groups below the age of 50,” she told a news conference after a weekly meeting of regional health chiefs. Reuters reports that unlike neighbouring France, which plans to offer vaccines to all adults from 31 May, Spain is progressively working its way downwards through age groups and has just begun giving shots to people aged 50-59. Nevertheless, the national incidence of the virus as measured over the past 14 days reached 126 cases per 100,000 people on Wednesday, down 13% in a week. In the coastal region of Valencia, the incidence fell to just 31 cases, among the lowest in Europe. Health Ministry data showed Spain had administered some 25.3 million vaccine doses and 8.4 million people have received a full course. The ministry reported 5,007 new cases on Wednesday, bringing the cumulative number of infections to 3.65 million. The death toll rose by 54 to 79,801. Earlier this month the prime minister Pedro Sanchez said a delivery of some 13 million doses in June would help Spain hit its target of vaccinating 70% of the population by mid-August. Cyprus recommended on Wednesday that those under 50 should receive so-called mRNA Covid vaccines, joining other countries like France who have set age restrictions for the AstraZeneca shot. The country had previously no age restrictions for the AstraZeneca vaccine, which it has been using since January. The change follows reports of the death of a British woman administered the shot earlier this month in Cyprus. The health ministry said it had referred the case to the European Medicines Agency (EMA). European drug regulators said last month there was a possible link between the vaccine and a very small number of cases of rare blood clots. Individuals who have already taken a single-dose of the Vaxzeveria jab should receive their second dose, provided there were no serious side effects like thrombosis or thrombocytopenia, the ministry said in a statement, citing the “unanimous view” of scientific advisors. A majority of those, it said, suggested that mRNA vaccines, technology used in the Pfizer/BioNtech and Moderna jab, be recommended for the under 50s. AstraZeneca’s shot uses a harmless, weakened version of a chimpanzee common-cold virus to deliver instructions to generate an immune response and prevent infection. Authorities had previously defended their decision not to impose age restrictions on the vaccine by saying people were offered a selection of shots and that they were following EMA guidelines. But Cyprus had ordered considerably more AstraZeneca vaccines. With other options quickly running out, Vaxzevria was the only one available to thousands of people scrambling to book an appointment on a state-administered vaccine portal. It had also made the AstraZeneca vaccine the only option available at private practitioners. About 40% of Cyprus’s population has taken the first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, and 17% has had both doses. A traveller arriving in Brazil has been diagnosed with the coronavirus variant first discovered in India, São Paulo health officials said on Wednesday, stoking concerns that it could further fuel one of the world’s deadliest outbreaks. São Paulo health authorities said they requested a complete list of the passengers on the flight coming from India, as well as the names of all airport staff and other people who may have had contact with the passenger, for monitoring and isolation. The variant, known as B.1.617.2, which is rampant in India, has been detected in 10 countries of the Americas, mainly associated with international travel, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) said on Wednesday. Cases have been detected in North, Central and South America, as well as the Caribbean, but no community transmission has so far been associated with the variant, a PAHO official said. Brazil has lost more than 450,000 lives to Covid-19, the worst death toll outside the US, and has struggled to contain transmission of homegrown variants and to accelerate a sputtering vaccination campaign. Following treatment of crew members with the B.1.617.2 variant on a cargo ship off Brazil’s northern coast last week, the case confirmed on Wednesday raised alarms about the easily transmissible variant passing through two of the country’s busiest airports. The 32-year-old patient, a resident of Campos dos Goytacazes in Rio de Janeiro state, landed at Guarulhos International Airport near Sao Paulo on 22 May, state officials said. The passenger was tested on arrival for Covid-19, but by the time São Paulo authorities were informed of the positive result, he had flown to Rio de Janeiro, according to a statement from state officials. São Paulo’s Adolfo Lutz Institute received the test material and announced the result of the virus sequencing on Wednesday. Federal health regulator Anvisa said the passenger, who arrived in Brazil with a prior negative PCR test, had been tested at a private lab at the Guarulhos airport. Anvisa in a statement said the passenger “received a positive result when he was already in Rio de Janeiro. Anvisa was informed of the positive result by the private laboratory.” Scientists in Germany claim to have solved the cause of the rare blood clotting events linked to the Oxford/AstraZeneca and Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines and believe the jabs could be fixed to prevent the reaction altogether, the FT (paywall) reports. Rolf Marschalek, a professor at Goethe university in Frankfurt who has been leading research into the rare condition since March, said his research showed that the problem lies with the adenovirus vectors that both vaccines use to deliver the spike protein of the virus into the body. In a preprint paper published today, the scientists wrote that the delivery mechanism means the vaccines send the spike protein into the cell nucleus as opposed to the cytosol fluid found inside the cell where the virus normally produces proteins. According to Marschalek’s research, once inside the cell nucleus, certain parts of the spike protein splice, creating mutant versions, which are unable to bind to the cell membrane where important immunisation takes place; instead, the floating mutant proteins are secreted by cells into the body, which is what triggers blood clots in roughly one in 100,000 people. In contrast, with mRNA-based vaccines, such as the BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna jabs, the spike’s genetic material is delivered to the cell fluid and it never enters the nucleus. Marschalek told the FT that when virus genes are in the nucleus they can create “some problems”. He believes there is a “way out” if the vaccine developers can adapt the sequence of the spike protein to prevent splicing. You can read the FT’s exclusive story here. France’s average daily number of new Covid-19 cases fell to its lowest level since mid-September while the number of people being treated for the virus in hospital continued to decline, official data showed on Wednesday. The daily figure, averaged out over seven days, fell below 10,000, down from a 2021 high of over 42,000 in mid-April. New confirmed infections rose by 12,646 over the past 24 hours to a cumulative 5.62 million since the start of the pandemic, a slower pace of growth than a week ago, when they rose by 19,000. Four weeks ago the figure was 31,000. The number of people in intensive care units with Covid-19 fell by 117 to 3,330, while the overall number of people in hospital with the virus fell by 837 to 18,593. Both numbers have been on a steady downward trend since the end of April. The health ministry also reported 144 new coronavirus deaths in hospitals on Wednesday, compared with 141 a week ago. Good evening from London. I’m Lucy Campbell, I’ll be bringing you all the latest global developments on the coronavirus pandemic for the next few hours. Please feel free to get in touch with me as I work if you have a story or tips to share! Your thoughts are always welcome. Email: lucy.campbell@theguardian.com Twitter: @lucy_campbell_ Johnson &amp; Johnson’s single-shot Covid vaccine is to be limited in Belgium to people aged 41 and over, authorities said following the death of a woman who received the jab. Switzerland is to re-open indoor restaurants and people will no longer be required to work from home, the government announced, saying it was lifting restrictions faster than previously planned. China accused the US of “spreading conspiracy theories and disinformation” after health chief Anthony Fauci said he was no longer convinced the coronavirus originated naturally – propelling the theory that it emerged from a Wuhan laboratory back into mainstream debate. The European Commission demanded an urgent court order requiring AstraZeneca to deliver millions more vaccines to the bloc or face a hefty fine, in a case that may reflect its anger more than its need for doses. Slovakia became the second EU country to authorise the use of the Russian-made Sputnik V Covid vaccine, which has not yet been approved by the bloc’s drug regulator. France will impose a compulsory quarantine on travellers arriving from the UK because of growing concerns over the spread of the Indian variant of the coronavirus, the government’s spokesman has said. Whistleblower protection groups urged the World Health Organization to launch an independent review into the case of an Italian researcher who reported being pressured to falsify data in a now-spiked WHO report into Italy’s coronavirus response. Perhaps conveniently for an incumbent candidate, Zambian president Edgar Lungu banned campaign rallies ahead of elections scheduled for 12 August, saying large gatherings risked spreading the Covid-19 virus. Vets in several parts of Russia reportedly started vaccinating cats against Covid-19. Russia in March said it had registered the world’s first coronavirus vaccine for animals. Only two animals in Russia, both cats, have so far tested positive for the virus. Here’s more on the AstraZeneca and European Commission row from our Europe correspondent Jon Henley. The EC has demanded an urgent court order requiring AstraZeneca to deliver millions more vaccines to the bloc or face a hefty fine, in a case that may reflect its anger more than its need for doses. “AstraZeneca did not even try to respect the contract,” the EU’s lawyer, Rafaël Jafferali, told a court in Brussels today, saying the EU wanted €10 per dose for each day of delay as compensation for the company’s alleged non-compliance. Jafferali said the penalty should apply from 1 July if AstraZeneca did not deliver at least 120m doses by the end of June and that the EU would also seek a penalty of at least €10m for each breach of the contract that the judge may eventually decide. Laboratory tests have shown that the coronavirus variant first discovered in India is more resistant to neutralising antibodies from vaccinated people, reports Nicola Davis, the Guardian’s science correspondent. Speaking at the same German Science Media Centre briefing as Prof Neil Ferguson (see earlier post), Prof Ravi Gupta, of Cambridge University, said however that the B.1.617.2 variant is less resistant to antibodies than the variant first identified in South Africa There are also biological changes in the virus that appear to help it to infected cells and transmit quicker between cells. That, he said, chimes with data from Public Health England showing that a single dose of a Covid jab is not very effective at preventing infection with the India variant – although protection is much better after a second dose. “In populations where there is partial immunity either from previous infection or low levels of antibody, then the virus will have that nice sweet spot of an advantage of immune evasion plus greater transmission,” he said, noting that he was surprised at the discovery of a cluster of infections among healthcare workers in India who had been fully vaccinated. The vaccines are still doing their job, they are still protecting you from severe disease. The worry here is that this is an avenue for virus to persist in a population, and then to reach unvaccinated people or vulnerable people in society. In the context of opening up society, he added: I believe that we should potentially be... allowing vaccines to have their full effect, which means waiting a little bit longer to reach more people, get second doses into a lot more people, so that the virus has a very, very strong barrier against it. Right now we have an issue where we are increasing social contacts in the face of an expanding, growth of the virus and so that gives the virus an opportunity to really seed itself within the UK population and it is going to be very difficult to get rid of it once it is there. Gupta said learning from the situation in India is important, although data on factors such as levels of previous exposure is limited. The findings in India could very well be explained by transmission in unvaccinated people who have not been infected before, but I think there is an element from what we are hearing from reports from various people, family members... that people who have had previous infection are getting infected again, many of them are getting severe disease, and that includes people who have been partially or fully vaccinated as well. A majority of people in the US believe discrimination against Asian Americans has worsened in the past year, as many became the target of attacks over the coronavirus pandemic’s link to China. Six in ten Americans said racism against Asian Americans has increased compared with a year ago, including 71% of Asian Americans, 66% of black Americans, 59% of white Americans and 55% of Hispanic Americans, according to a poll by the Associated Press. A majority of Asian Americans said they feel unsafe in public because of their race. In the year to March, more than 6,600 anti-Asian hate incidents were documented by Stop AAPI Hate, a national reporting centre, the AP reported. The attacked ranged from verbal harassment to killings, including the March 16 Atlanta-area shootings that killed six Asian women. Neil Ferguson, the British professor whose epidemiological monitoring was influential at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, has said the variant first discovered in India is driving a rise in infections in the UK, reports Nicola Davis, the Guardian’s science correspondent. Speaking at a briefing run by the German Science Media Centre, Ferguson said: Like B.1.1.7 – the Kent variant before it – what we are seeing now is this Indian variant B.1.617.2 quite rapidly replacing previous variants in circulation including the Kent one, and that growth has been fairly consistent in the last four weeks or so. There is a slight uptick now in infection rates in the UK and that is down to B.1.617.2. But, Ferguson said, the situation is very different late last year when the Kent variant emerged, noting that infection levels in the UK are currently low, while over half the population have received a Covid vaccine. One difficulty, said Ferguson, is that it is hard to be sure just how much more transmissible the India variant is compared with the Kent variant. “Effectively they are circulating in quite different population groups,” he said, noting the Kent variant is disturbed across the population but at low levels whereas the India variant entered the country through importation into a small subset of communities and has grown rapidly. What we can say though is it definitely more transmissible and it could be anywhere from 20% to 80% more transmissible, but we really can’t pin a number on that at the moment. Documents released by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) suggested it is “a realistic possibility” that the India variant could be up to 50% more transmissible than the Kent variant. Ferguson added that there is a “hint in the data” that under 21s are slightly more likely to be infected with the India variant compared with other variants in recent weeks in the UK, although the explanation is unclear. Whether that reflects a change in the biology or reflects what is called ‘founder effects’ – the contacts the people who came into the country with virus made and then seeding of infection in certain schools, colleges, that is impossible to resolve at the moment. Vets in several parts of Russia have started vaccinating cats against Covid-19, according to Reuters, citing the RIA news agency. Russia in March said it had registered the world’s first coronavirus vaccine for animals. Tests showed it generated antibodies against the coronavirus in dogs, cats, foxes and mink. Only two animals in Russia, both cats, have so far tested positive for the virus. Ireland has 448 confirmed cases of coronavirus, the country’s department of health reports. Ninety nine are in hospital; 41 in intensive care. The coronavirus variant first detected in India has been found in 10 countries in the Americas, the Pan Americas Health Organization (PAHO) said on Wednesday. The cases have been detected in North, Central and South America, as well as the Caribbean, though no community transmission has been associated with this variant, Sylvain Aldighieri, PAHO’s incident manager, said in a briefing from Washington. The number of Covid patients in intensive care units in France fell by 19 to 3,330 on Wednesday, the health ministry reported, according to Reuters. The overall number of people in hospital with the virus was 837, a fall of 18,593. The health ministry also reported 144 more Covid deaths in hospitals on Wednesday, slightly higher than the 141 reported a week ago. This is Damien Gayle taking the reins on the live blog for a little bit, while Mattha has a break A French court has found four students guilty of inciting racial hatred online by posting anti-Asian tweets blaming Chinese people for the spread of coronavirus. AFP reports: The four, aged between 19 and 24 and without criminal records, were sentenced to two days of civic education by the Paris criminal court, and ordered to pay €250 euros to each of the seven plaintiffs and up to 1,000 euros in fines. A fifth accused student was found not guilty. The students posted the tweets after president Emmanuel Macron announced a second round of strict stay-at-home rules on 29 October. The four were found guilty of “public incitement, not followed by acts, to commit a voluntary offence against the integrity of a person because of their origins”, the verdict read. Soc Lam, a lawyer for the Association of Young Chinese People in France, said the ruling was a welcome sign the courts were taking online hate speech seriously. The coronavirus pandemic has led to “new dimensions of anti-Asian racism,” according to study last year by France’s Institute of National Demographic Studies (INED). Critics have accused police of neglecting to address threats against France’s Chinese community. Switzerland is to re-open indoor restaurants and people will no longer be required to work from home, the government has announced, saying it was lifting restrictions faster than previously planned. AFP has the story: Switzerland said its fourth wave of easing coronavirus measures would take place on Monday, with the wealthy Alpine nation moving to a stabilisation phase in managing the pandemic, as it eyes completing the vaccination of high-risk groups by the end of May. “The Federal Council is going further than proposed,” the government said in a statement. “In so doing, it is responding to the improved epidemiological situation.” The government said the requirement to work from home was now being downgraded to a recommendation, while public and private gathering limits were being raised. “As of Monday, restaurants will once again be able to serve guests indoors,” the statement announced. Up to four people will be allowed at a table, though contact details will have to be recorded. Masks will have to be worn when moving around inside, and the 11:00 pm curfew is being lifted. Outdoor dining reopened in April. “Working from home will be a recommendation rather than a requirement for businesses that carry out weekly testing. A return to the office should be gradual,” the government said. At public events, up to 100 people will be allowed to gather indoors and up to 300 people outdoors (up from 50 and 100 respectively), up to a maximum of half of the capacity of venues. At private gatherings, 30 people will be able to meet indoors, and up to 50 outdoors - up from 10 and 15 respectively. Johnson &amp; Johnson’s single-shot Covid vaccine is to be limited in Belgium to people aged 41 and over, authorities have said following the death of a woman who received the jab. AFP has the full story: The country’s inter-ministerial health body focused on the pandemic said that restriction will be “provisionally” applied pending further guidance from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on Johnson &amp; Johnson’s Janssen vaccine. The move underlined the level of caution EU countries are showing to Covid vaccines, particularly the two adenovirus ones made by Johnson &amp; Johnson and by AstraZeneca. Those two have suspected links to very rare but very serious instances of blood clots coupled with low platelet levels which were seen in several deaths. Last month the EMA drew a link between rare blood clots and AstraZeneca and Johnson &amp; Johnson jabs but stressed that the benefits of the vaccines outweighed the risk. Several EU countries have restricted the use of AstraZeneca’s vaccine to older people, typically over 55 or 60. Austria is phasing it out and plans to stop using it in June. Denmark has dropped the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine from its national vaccination programme altogether. Non-EU member Norway, which has dropped AstraZeneca, is offering Johnson &amp; Johnson only to volunteers. In Belgium, the death of the woman - said to be aged under 40 and vaccinated through her employer outside of the country - was the “only case” identified, the inter-ministerial body said in a statement. The woman died on Friday after being admitted to hospital with “severe thrombosis and a deficit of blood platelets”, it said. Mexico will tomorrow receive more than 2.2 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine as part of the global Covax vaccine-sharing plan, foreign minister Marcelo Ebrard has said. The global programme - co-led by the GAVI vaccine alliance and the World Health Organization (WHO) - aims to provide vaccines for low and middle income countries but has experienced delays amid worldwide vaccine shortages after pharmaceutical companies fell short on their pledges. Ebrard said Covax has informed Mexico that 2,229,600 doses will arrive from Amsterdam. “This will ensure the [supply of] doses for people 50 years of age and over,” Ebrard said on Twitter. Whistleblower protection groups have urged the World Health Organization to launch an independent review into the case of an Italian researcher who reported being pressured to falsify data in a now-spiked WHO report into Italy’s coronavirus response. AP has the story: The groups, including Transparency International, Whistleblowing International Network and some 30 other public health and anti-corruption groups, sent an open letter to the president of the World Health Assembly. The assembly, WHO’s highest decision-making body, is made up of all WHO member states and is meeting this week. In the letter, the signatories called for the UN agency to commit to reforming its whistleblowing protection policy. They said the Italian researcher, Dr Francesco Zambon, had suffered retaliatory treatment for having reported the incident within WHO’s internal ethics system. Zambon resigned in March, saying he had been isolated and marginalised after he complained internally, and then publicly, about the scandal. Zambon has said he was pressured by a then-assistant director general, Dr Ranieri Guerra, to falsify data about Italy’s preparedness going into the pandemic in a report he and other researchers were writing to help other countries prepare as Covid-19 swept across the globe last year. Emails and drafts of the report show Guerra wanted the report to say that Italy had “updated and reconfirmed” its pandemic preparedness plan in 2016. Zambon says Italy’s plan dated from 2006 and refused to make the change. The report was published May 13, 2020, but was taken down from the website a day later, after WHO’s Beijing office flagged politically sensitive problems with a timeline about the virus’ origins in China. Zambon says he corrected the timeline and had the report reprinted, but WHO never re-posted it or distributed it. Spanish prime minister Pedro Sanchez has discussed opportunities for China to co-invest in projects financed by EU pandemic recovery funds with Chinese president Xi Jinping. Earlier today, Hungary approved a bill essential to the green-lighting of EU’s recovery fund, bringing the bloc a step closer to putting the deal into operation. Reuters reports that regulators in Brussels and Washington have been wary of China’s increased clout in Europe and frown upon Chinese investment in critical infrastructure. But the Spanish government said in a statement Sanchez had told Xi he was confident that common ground could be found to ratify a long-awaited investment agreement between Beijing and Brussels, and suggested Spain could play a constructive role in strengthening Sino-EU relations. With Spain due to receive some €140 billion in pandemic recovery funds in the coming years, Sanchez pointed to investment opportunities in the “green transition, electric mobility, circular economy and digitalisation”. Reuters also reports that ahead of the first disbursement of the EU cash, Spain has also been courting Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds to co-invest on major projects. Last year, the government passed a decree giving it a veto on foreign acquisitions of stakes bigger than 10% in Spanish companies deemed strategic. Thailand is modifying its immunisation strategy to target worst-hit areas and sectors where clusters are most likely to emerge, officials have said. Reuters has more: The strategy prioritises the epicentre Bangkok and nearby provinces, tourism hotspots, construction camps and potential spreaders, like public transport workers, the government’s COVID-19 taskforce said. Thailand reported a daily record 41 deaths today, bringing overall fatalities to 873, about 90% of which were during the current outbreak that started early in April. The outbreak is also responsible for the bulk of its total 137,894 cumulative cases. Thailand is due to start mass vaccinations next month and of its than 66 million people, only 2.5 million have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine, mostly the Sinovac brand. Thailand has reserved 61 million locally-made AstraZeneca vaccines for its main drive. Vaccine distribution had earlier been based on reservations made by provincial health authorities, some with low cases numbers, said taskforce spokesman Taweesin Wisanuyothin. The health ministry said two doses of Sinovac vaccine had reduced the risk of infection by 83.3%, according to its study on the holiday island of Phuket, where 22% of the population has received both required doses. Perhaps conveniently for an incumbent candidate, Zambian president Edgar Lungu has banned campaign rallies ahead of elections scheduled for 12 August, saying large gatherings risked spreading the Covid-19 virus. True, of course, though the virus travels exponentially faster indoors – where the supermajority of transmissions are believed to occur. Also, he made the comments at a gathering of hundreds of supporters. Reuters reports: Opposition parties have pilloried Lungu’s handling of the crisis. Last year, police shot dead two people after the main opposition party leader was summoned for police questioning over a decade-and-a-half old fraud allegation. Speaking at the launch of his own campaign in the capital Lusaka, clad in dark green jumper and cap representing the ruling Patriotic Front (PF) colours, Lungu told the hundreds of party supporters gathered that he would not hold public rallies, and expected opposition parties to do the same. “Therefore, in my capacity as head of state and the government, I hereby direct the police service and the ministry of health to ensure enforcement of the Covid-19 pandemic health regulations and guidelines without fear or favour,” Lungu said. “What will it benefit you to be holding rallies, but then sacrifice the lives of our citizens and voters to Covid-19 and death?” The southern African nation has recorded more than 93,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19, with more than 1,200 deaths. Opposition leader Hakainde Hichilema’s spokesman, Anthony Bwalya, told Reuters the party would go ahead with its campaign rallies, saying Covid-19 cases had subsided. “President Lungu is being hypocritical, because the gathering outside the conference centre where he launched his campaign was more like a rally,” Bwalya said. Tunisia is counting on Russians and eastern Europeans to help rejuvenate its tourist sector, hit hard by the pandemic and leaving employees in the sector facing severe poverty, AFP reports. “The need to work is stronger than the fear of being contaminated,” said lifeguard Aymen Abdallah, glancing at a half-empty beach in the Mediterranean resort of Sousse where Russians are making a comeback. “If we don’t work, we’ll starve to death.” The lifeguard is relieved to be back at work after an idle eight months. But “normally, the beach would have been full at this time”, he sighed. The North African country reopened its borders to tour operators in late April but then ordered a new week-long partial lockdown at the start of May because of a spike in coronavirus cases. Up to 10 flights a week, mostly from Russia and eastern Europe, have in the past month been touching down at Enfidha, an airport serving Tunisia’s tourism towns. But revenues are down more than 60 percent on 2019, before the pandemic hit. Hotels are authorised to operate at 50 percent of capacity but are struggling to reach that level. “There’s not much profit with just 30 percent hotel occupancy,” lamented Adel Mlayah, deputy director of the high-end Mouradi Palace in Sousse. The hotel normally employs at least 260 staff, but this year no more than 120 are working. While visitors from most West countries are deterred from travel by their governments, those from Russia, the Czech Republic and Poland appeared to have few such qualms. Slovakia has become the second EU country to authorise the use of the Russian-made Sputnik V Covid vaccine, which has not yet been approved by the bloc’s drug regulator. The Slovak government asked health minister Vladimir Lengvarsky to make the jab available by 7 June. Slovakia has 200,000 doses of Sputnik V vaccine in stock but had not allowed its use until now. Hungary is the only other EU nation to use Sputnik V. A secret deal for Slovakia to purchase 2 million Sputnik V shots orchestrated by then-prime minister Igor Matovic triggered a political crisis in March that resulted in the Slovak government’s collapse. Further extraordinary and incendiary claims are continuing to come out from the UK parliamentary committee hearing where the prime minister’s former chief aide Dominic Cummings is giving evidence. The latest allegation is that Boris Johnson said in July: “Chaos is not bad. Chaos means that everyone has to look to me to see who’s in charge.” Here’s our latest coverage, and a link to Andrew Sparrow’s live blog: A “massive anti-vaccination campaign” has been cited by the European Commission as a reason for social media platforms to intensify their factchecking and revise the internal algorithms that can amplify disinformation. France will impose a compulsory quarantine on travellers arriving from the UK because of growing concerns over the spread of the Indian variant of the coronavirus, the government’s spokesman has said. Gabriel Attal told reporters at the end of the cabinet meeting this morning that the government would announce the date when the widely expected decision would come into effect “in the coming hours”. France requires travellers from 16 countries, including Brazil, India, Argentina and Turkey, to undergo a compulsory 10-day period of self-isolation, with a fine of €1,500 in the event of non-compliance. Germany on Saturday banned all travellers from Britain from entering its territory from midnight on 23 May from Sunday after designating the UK as a “virus variant area of concern”. German citizens and residents and their spouses and children are exempt from the measure, along with people travelling for urgent humanitarian reasons, but everyone arriving from the UK must now quarantine for two weeks. even if they test negative. The Associated Press has this dispatch from the Turkish city of Mardin, where so-called “vaccination persuasion” teams are working to promote inoculation against Covid among vulnerable people amid apparent reluctancy. In the medieval Turkish city of Mardin, Medine Ereli calls out to a team of medical workers walking along the town’s cobblestoned main street. Her 59-year old husband refuses to get vaccinated, she tells the doctor and nurse, before leading them to Enver Ereli, who’s on the job as a municipal sanitation worker. The mobile door-to-door units – equipped with coolers carrying vaccine vials – have been operational in several Turkish provinces since April. At local health offices, more government workers reach people by phone in an attempt to change their minds. Health minister Fahrettin Koca says 84% of the population age 65 and above who are eligible to be vaccinated have so far received Covid-19 shots. The government aims to bring that figure above 90%. In Mardin, the team talked Ereli into getting his shot and the nurse administered the first jab while he sat down on a nearby ledge. “I was afraid of getting sick and of being paralysed. But then the medical teams told me it was for my benefit and I believed them and got vaccinated,” Ereli said. A Belgian judge has begun hearing an urgent European Commission request for a court order requiring AstraZeneca to deliver millions more vaccines to the bloc, in a case that may reflect the EU’s anger more than its need for doses. The court, which will examine in a later case whether the Anglo-Swedish pharmaceuticals company broke its contract with the EU, heard the commission argue on Wednesday that an “urgent need” for the shots warranted an emergency order. AstraZeneca supplied only 30m of the 120m Covid-19 vaccine doses it was scheduled to deliver to the bloc by the end of March, and the commission says the company is on course to deliver 70m of a promised 180m in the second quarter. The commission’s lawyer, Rafaël Jafferali, told the court the company now expected to deliver the full 300m doses in its contract by the end of December, but added: “With a six-month delay, it’s obviously a failure.” Bahrain is to close shopping malls, restaurants and coffee shops for two weeks starting from tomorrow as part of efforts to contain the spread of the coronavirus, state TV reported. Beauty salons, spas and barber shops will also close and no event or conference should be held during this period, it said, citing the national committee to combat the pandemic, Reuters reports. China has accused the US of “spreading conspiracy theories and disinformation” as Anthony Fauci said he was no longer convinced the coronavirus originated naturally – propelling the theory that it emerged from a Wuhan laboratory back into mainstream debate. AFP reports: Led by the US, pressure is mounting for a new probe into the origins of Covid-19 after a World Health Organization (WHO) mission to China, beset by delays and dogged by political baggage, returned inconclusive findings. The Wuhan Institute of Virology has returned to the spotlight after a report in The Wall Street Journal, citing US intelligence, said three lab workers there were hospitalised in November 2019 with coronavirus-like symptoms, a month before the pandemic’s first declared case. The newspaper also said researchers had collected samples seven years earlier from a mine in southwestern China, where miners had contracted a mysterious illness from a new, bat-borne coronavirus. Repeating an earlier denial of the report, Zhao Lijian, spokesman for China’s foreign ministry, accused the US of “spreading conspiracy theories and disinformation such as a laboratory leak”. The theory that the killer virus leaked from a Chinese lab was originally fuelled by, among others, the administration of former US president Donald Trump. Zhao said it was “disrespectful” to the WHO probe to revive the theory, and risked an “undermining of global solidarity to fight the virus”. Fauci had said: “I am not convinced about that, I think we should continue to investigate what went on in China until we continue to find out to the best of our ability what happened. Certainly, the people who investigated it say it likely was the emergence from an animal reservoir that then infected individuals, but it could have been something else, and we need to find that out. So, you know, that’s the reason why I said I’m perfectly in favour of any investigation that looks into the origin of the virus.” Pakistan has opened up its vaccination campaign to everyone aged 19 or older as it moves to protect more of its 220 million people. Reuters reports: Pakistan has had to deal with vaccination hesitancy and a shortage of vaccine supplies and had limited shots to people aged 30 or over. But with purchases and donations from China and allocations from the World Health Organisation and the GAVI Vaccine Alliance, it has now secured more than 18 million doses and is keen to get them out into the population. “We decided to open up vaccination registration for all 19 years and above,” Asad Umar, minister in-charge of supervising anti-COVID operations, said in a post on Twitter. People can sign up from Thursday, he said. “So now registration will be open for the entire national population which is approved by health experts for Covid vaccination,” Umar said. Pakistan has reported more than 900,000 coronavirus infections and some 20,465 deaths. Today, authorities reported 2,724 new infections and 65 deaths in the previous 24 hours. Pakistan has administered 5.3 million vaccine doses with supplies from three Chinese companies - Sinopharm, Sinovac and CanSinbio - and the Oxford-AstraZeneca shots. UN humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock has called on warring parties to focus together on the true fight of our lives” against “a common enemy: Covid-19.” AP reports: While there were some positive responses to the pandemic, Lowcock said deadly conflicts continued and emerged or got worse including in Ethiopia, Mozambique and between Armenia and Azerbaijan, contributing to a rise in the number of people forcibly displaced in 2020. “At the same time, insecurity, sanctions, counter-terrorism measures and administrative hurdles hindered humanitarian operations,” he said, and the pandemic made aid deliveries more difficult because of suspended flights, border closures, quarantine measures and lockdowns. Lowcock noted “multiple reports of atrocities” against civilians caught in conflicts during the pandemic. “By the end of 2020, nearly 100 million people faced crisis or worse levels of acute food insecurity as a result of conflict,” he said. “That was up from 77 million the year before,” he said. Lowcock also cited the impact of conflicts on civilians in urban areas from explosive devices, on farmers from the destruction of agricultural land, and on entire populations from attacks on medical care. “Last year, attacks on health care across 22 conflict-affected countries killed 182 health workers,” with the highest numbers losing their lives in Burkina Faso, Congo, Somalia and Syria, he said. In a two-month period this year, Lowcock said, 109 violent incidents against health care were documented in Myanmar, where a military coup took place on 1 February, “accelerating the collapse in the public health-care system when many people needed it most.” Taiwan has accused China of hindering its efforts to obtain Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines from Germany amid a rise in coronavirus cases. Today, president Tsai Ing-wen explicitly accused China of being a stumbling block to getting Pfizer shots. “We had almost completed the contract-signing with the German manufacturer at one point but it has been delayed till now because China has interfered,” Tsai said in a post on her Facebook page. Back in February, Taiwanese officials hinted China was causing difficulties, but officials steered clear of explicitly naming Beijing, which works to keep the island diplomatically isolated. Tsai’s administration has not detailed why it believes China has been a stumbling block and Beijing has previously denied putting up roadblocks. Pfizer-BioNTech’s distributor for the Greater China region - which includes Taiwan - is Fosun Pharma based in Shanghai. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said “Taiwan’s access to vaccines from the mainland is smooth,” without elaborating further. “We don’t recognise this so-called president, she is only the leader of a region of China,” he added. Taiwan – population 23.5 million – has so far only received some 726,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine via the Covax global sharing scheme and from the manufacturer itself. Cases have swiftly risen to 6,000, while deaths have tripled to 46 after an outbreak among airline pilots spread. The government has since brought in strict social distancing restrictions, including closing public venues and schools, until 14 June. Indian doctors have questioned the free distribution of an ayurvedic medicine to Covid patients by the state of Haryana as the maker of the herbal concoction which has not undergone large clinical trials faced criticism. The news comes after the state of Goa announced it would give anti-parasitic drug Ivermectin to all adults due to claims, which have raised some eyebrows – not least at the World Health Organisation – that it may help combat the virus. Reuters has the full story: The northern state, which is ruled by prime minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janta Party, said this week it would hand out Coronil to Covid-19 patients. The ayurvedic medicine was launched by yoga guru Baba Ramdev’s company Patanjali Ayurved last year. The government later said the consumer goods company co-founded by Ramdev, who has a large following in India, could not market the drug as a cure, and it needed to market it as an immunity booster. There is no scientific basis to Coronil’s use in treating Covid-19 patients, said Ajay Khanna, the state secretary of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) in Uttarakhand, where Patanjali is headquartered. One small study suggests it could be effective, but experts have said further research would be required to support any such claims. Ayurveda is an ancient Indian system that includes medicines, meditation, exercise and dietary guidelines practiced by millions of adherents. Hungary has approved a bill essential to the green-lighting of EU’s recovery fund, bringing the bloc a step closer to putting the deal into operation. Reuters has the story: The 27 EU nations made an unprecedented agreement last year to jointly borrow €750 billion euros for the fund. But all 27 must ratify a decision to raise the upper limit for national contributions for the plan to go ahead. Until today, Hungary was one of a handful yet to do so. Nationalist prime minister Viktor Orban, who has been in power for over a decade, has often been at loggerheads with Brussels over curbs on independent media, academics, courts and NGOs, as well as his restrictive approach to migration. However, tens of billions of euros worth of funds flowing from the EU into Hungary have helped his government boost GDP growth and will continue to be crucial as the economy rebounds from last year’s recession. Orban has also used public spending to strengthen a loyal business elite, partly using billions of euros worth of EU funds. Hungary, the only EU country to have approved and deployed Russian and Chinese vaccines before the European Medicines Agency has approved them, has vaccinated over half of its 10 million citizens, and has reopened most the economy. Other EU states yet to sign off on the EU recovery fund deal are Romania, Austria and Poland. Hello to everyone reading, Mattha Busby here taking over. Do drop me a line on Twitter with any tips or thoughts. The European Medicines Agency will announce on Friday whether it has approved the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus jab for 12- to 15-year-olds, the regulator has said. If approved, it will be the first vaccine to get the green light for young people in the 27-nation European Union. The US and other countries have called for a more in-depth investigation of the pandemic origins, after an international mission to China earlier this year proved inconclusive. France has set up extra Covid testing centres after a cluster of around 50 people in Bordeaux were found to be positive with a new virus variant described by the regional health authority as “very rare”. India’s total coronavirus infections crossed 27 million on Wednesday, swelled by 208,921 new cases over the last 24 hours, while daily deaths from Covid-19 rose by 4,157 The Maldives will restrict movement to curb a surge in coronavirus infections that is putting pressure on the island’s healthcare facilities. Taiwan has reported its highest daily number of Covid-19 fatalities, with 11 deaths recorded on Tuesday, and tightened restrictions on the population. In Germany, the rate of infections continues to fall, reaching a seven-month low. AstraZeneca and Nipro Corp have signed an agreement to supply the British-Swedish company’s Covid-19 vaccine in Japan. The United Arab Emirates said vaccinations against Covid-19 will be mandatory for people attending all “live events” from 6 June. Easily the biggest news draw domestically at the moment on Covid is Dominic Cummings explaining what he thought were the failings of the UK government to prepare. You can follow that live with Andrew Sparrow here: I’ll be back tomorrow, Mattha Busby will be here shortly to lead you through the rest of the day’s global Covid news. The economic impact of Covid has not been evenly distributed in the US, as Alexandra Villarreal reports for us: Over the first two months of the health crisis, the number of active Black, Latino and Asian business owners plummeted by 41%, 32% and 26% respectively, versus just 17% for white entrepreneurs. That outsized toll has lasted well into 2021, when half of small and mid-sized minority-owned businesses couldn’t pay all of their April rent on time, according to a recent poll. And, even as the country reopens, more than a third of Black entrepreneurs say conditions are getting worse for their small businesses, while 37% fear “they may not survive the next three months”, a spring survey by Small Business Majority found. “We need to start thinking about the recovery – how we actually build back the minority-owned businesses that we lost,” said Carlos Fernando Avenancio-León, an assistant professor of finance at the University of California, San Diego. Many business people of color went into the pandemic already at a disadvantage, with lower annual revenues than their white counterparts and dismal access to funding opportunities. Black and Hispanic entrepreneurs are also less likely to have emergency savings tucked away, plus they have fewer stocks and other liquid assets to help them weather an economic downturn. Read more of Alexandra Villarreal’s report here: ‘Permanent damage’: can minority-owned businesses recover from pandemic’s toll? The European Medicines Agency will announce on Friday whether it has approved the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus jab for 12- to 15-year-olds, the regulator has said. AFP reports that if approved, it will be the first vaccine to get the green light for young people in the 27-nation European Union. Pfizer is currently authorised for people aged 16 and older. The EMA will give a briefing on Friday to “cover the outcome of the extraordinary meeting of EMA’s human medicine committee … to discuss the paediatric indication for Comirnaty”, it said in an email. Comirnaty is the brand name for the vaccine developed by US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and the German research firm BioNTech. The US Food and Drug Administration has already authorised Pfizer for 12- to 15-year-olds. EMA chief Emer Cooke said earlier this month that the Amsterdam-based watchdog was fast-tracking the approval for young people, which was originally expected in June. She told European newspapers on 11 May the regulator had received Pfizer-BioNTech data and “we’ve been promised data from clinical trials and the study carried out in Canada within the next two weeks, and we are going to speed up our evaluation”. Nectar Gan and James Griffiths at CNN have a little more on the information war being waged by China as there are growing calls for a more thorough investigation into the origins of the novel coronavirus. They write: After facing fierce attacks from Republicans, top US infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci now has a new critic: Chinese state media. “US elites degenerate further in morality, and Fauci is one of them,” was the headline of a blistering opinion piece penned by Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of the state-run Global Times this week. In the article, Hu accused the top US infectious disease expert of “fanning a huge lie against China” by hyping the theory that the coronavirus was leaked from a Wuhan lab. Another article in the Global Times declared that Fauci had “betrayed Chinese scientists.” The anger is centered on Fauci’s remarks this month that he is no longer convinced the Covid-19 pandemic originated naturally. “I think we should continue to investigate what went on in China until we continue to find out to the best of our ability what happened,” said the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at a fact-checking symposium on 11 May. Fauci’s comments were followed by a Wall Street Journal exclusive, citing a US intelligence report, that said three researchers from the Wuhan Institute of Virology became sick enough in November 2019 that they sought hospital care. Unsurprisingly, China has vehemently refuted the report. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said the report was “totally inconsistent with the facts” and a director at the lab called the report “a complete lie.” Read more here: CNN – Chinese state media is turning on Fauci amid Wuhan lab controversy The Maldives will restrict movement to curb a surge in coronavirus infections that is putting pressure on the island’s healthcare facilities, officials said. Tanvi Mehta reports for Reuters that people will be allowed out for a few hours each day for essential supplies and a strict curfew will be in place from 4pm to 8am the next day, the Health Protection Agency said. The restrictions come as the Indian Ocean island has seen a rise in cases and is struggling with a shortage of medical staff, many of whom come from India which is battling its own deadly wave of infections. “Especially due to the situation in India, which is traditionally the biggest source country, we are finding it difficult to hire new medical professionals to deal with the increased caseload,” Mabrook Azeez, the spokesman for the President’s Office told Reuters. The Maldives reported 1,004 fresh cases on Tuesday with a tally of 58,345 total infections, according to the health agency, with cases concentrated in the capital Male. Last week, daily cases hit a record 2,194, setting off alarm in the tropical island chain with a population of a little over half a million. President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih said the country had erred in lifting curbs on public movement. “The easing of restrictions in April was not right. I don’t think those decisions were good enough. However, I am not going to put that responsibility on anyone,” he told reporters. The country held local council elections in April during which public meetings were held. Family gatherings and congregation alto took place in mosques during the holy month of Ramadan. Andrew Sparrow has just launched our UK live blog for the day which you imagine will be wall-to-wall Dominic Cummings and how the UK government prepared – or didn’t – for the pandemic. I’ll be continuing here with leading international developments on the coronavirus. In Germany, the rate of infections continues to fall, reaching a seven-month low. The country’s disease control agency today reported 46.8 new infections per 100,000 people within the space of seven days, the incidence rate dropping below 50 for the first time since October. Overall, Germany only recorded 2,626 new infections on Tuesday, though a lag in reporting due to a bank holiday could also be a factor behind the latest drop in numbers. Leading coronavirus expert Christian Drosten has attributed the drop in numbers largely to lockdown measures in the spring and the progress of the vaccination campaign, arguing it was easy to overestimate the impact of the summery temperatures. “Once cannot assume that the temperatures will take care of this thing”, Drosten told broadcaster NDR. France has set up extra Covid testing centres after a cluster of around 50 people in Bordeaux were found to be positive with a new virus variant described by the regional health authority as “very rare”. Although the new strain has been called the “Bordeaux variant”, Prof Patrick Dehail, scientific and medical advisor to the local health authority, says it is actually a mutation of the B.1.1.7 first detected in Kent, known locally as the “English variant”. It has been picked up before now, but this is the first time it has created such a large cluster. Many of those who tested positive were students at a school in the Bacalan district of the city and their parents. None of them has been hospitalised and Dehail said they showed “the usual symptoms or no symptoms”. He added that all the vaccines being delivered in France – PfizerBioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca and Janssen – covered this variant. About 80% of all new Covid cases in France are the “English variant”, a more contagious variation of the original coronavirus. The UK’s health secretary Matt Hancock prioritising publicising vaccines rather than speculating about Dominic Cummings while out on his morning run here. AstraZeneca and Nipro Corp have signed an agreement to supply the British-Swedish company’s Covid-19 vaccine in Japan. Nipro said the contract was for filling the shot into vials and packaging it, due to start next month. Japan’s government has agreed to acquire 120m doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccine, enough for 60m people. The shot was officially approved in Japan on Friday along with the one developed by Moderna. Japan started its inoculation drive in mid-February, later than most major economies and using imported doses of the shot developed by Pfizer/BioNTech. The Moderna vaccine went into use this week with the opening of mass vaccination centres. But there are, Reuters report, no immediate plans to use AstraZeneca’s shot in Japan, amid lingering concerns raised internationally over blood clots. China’s official vaccination figures continue to dwarf the efforts of others. Reuters report that China administered about 19.5m Covid-19 vaccine doses on 25 May, bringing the total number of doses administered to 546m, according to data released by the National Health Commission on Wednesday. AFP has a despatch from Kinshasa, capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, this morning, where it says residents are still banking on “God’s protection” from Covid. When the coronavirus arrived from Europe in sub-Saharan Africa’s second largest city in March 2020, residents feared the worst. “Covid should have devastated us. But so far, we have been spared,” said Aimee Rugambo, a nurse at a government Covid treatment centre at Vijana hospital. “God is in control! He protected us.” But she added: “We must tell people that Covid exists. It is in Kinshasa, and it kills.” Official national figures show 30,862 cases since March 2020, the vast majority in Kinshasa (21,284), and 779 deaths. The figure, if credible, is negligible in a gigantic country that has suffered war and suffering for the past three decades. “We will never know the number of infected or dead from corona – most are not tested,” a Congolese journalist noted. “It’s too complicated or too expensive.” Grappling with so many other scourges on a daily basis, “you only go to the hospital if you are seriously ill”, he said. Vaccination is free and open to all, but the campaign is not taking off. Last weekend, only 11,000 people were reported vaccinated in Kinshasa, of a national total of 14,434. “People are sceptical,” lamented Wamba Nice, director of the Vijana hospital. “Many are afraid, mainly because of the rumours on social networks.” Only two people showed up for the jab at the Vijana treatment centre, both from the Indian subcontinent, who declined to speak. The day before, no one came, but for now it is mainly foreigners who are benefiting from it. “Few people come … it’s a shame,” Dr Nice said, fearing that some doses will have to be destroyed because they have gone beyond their expiry date. Both Conservative transport minister Grant Shapps and Labour’s shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy have been on BBC Breakfast this morning in the UK. Of Dominic Cummings, Nandy said: What will be important today is whether Dominic Cummings comes armed with evidence. Either the prime minister is lying, or the prime minister has appointed someone to one of the most senior positions in government who himself is a liar, who made key decisions about Covid and who the prime minister stood by, even when he broke the lockdown rules himself. Either way, this does not reflect well on the prime minister’s judgment or his character. Shapps wasn’t particularly flattering either, according to PA Media. Asked whether Cummings was a “trusted adviser”, Shapps said: “He was certainly an adviser of the government. It’s for others to decide the trusted part of it.” Shapps also accepted that Cummings’ actions last year had damaged the government’s messaging on Covid restrictions. He said: “I accept it was a moment which actually in the public’s mind undermined the wider messages and I accept that.” Taiwan has reported its highest daily number of Covid-19 fatalities, with 11 deaths recorded on Tuesday, and tightened restrictions on the population. All fatalities were people aged over 50, with nine connected to the Wanhua cluster in Taipei city. At a press conference a short time ago, the central epidemic command centre also reported an uptick in daily case numbers, as well as hundreds more positive cases from the past few weeks discovered as they process a backlog of test results. There were 302 new local cases reported today, and 333 added to previous days’ totals. While cases are now in every county, the vast majority of the new cases and all but eight of the delayed cases are in the northern cities of Taipei and New Taipei. The updated figures for the past week show daily figures peaked on 17 May with 526 cases. It also revealed delays are still significantly affecting current reporting, with 92 new cases added to yesterday’s total. Health and welfare minister Chen Chih-Shung said the level 3 alert restricting people’s social movements had been effective but needed to be tighter in light of the continuing daily case cases. He said all restaurants must now offer takeaway only (a rule already enforced by several city governments), and all wedding, funerals and religious services were cancelled. He also pledged tougher enforcement and punishment for people not wearing masks outside, and recreation businesses operating when they’d been told to close. Asked about continuing suggestions from health experts that tighter restrictions or lockdowns were necessary to control the outbreak, Chen said they wanted to prevent “Covid fatigue” “Secondly, it is too costly for our economy to halt all activities. What I can say is that we have been working closely with the Ministry of Economic Affairs to provide a smooth base of operation for crucial industries,” he said. Transport minister Grant Shapps is the man out and about on the UK media this morning fronting up the government’s pre-damage limitation operation ahead of Dominic Cummings’ appearance this morning – that session starts at 9.30am by the way. You can expect a steady drip, drip, drip of quotes from Shapps this morning as he goes round TV and radio studios. Already he has dismissed it as a “sideshow”. PA Media notes that on Sky News, Shapps has said “I’ll leave others to determine how reliable a witness to all this he is. He was there at the time, what his motives would be I will leave to others.” Shapps definitely appeared to think Cummings was a credible and reliable witness this time last year. After weeks of slow bookings at the mass vaccination hubs in Melbourne, Australia, there were long queues outside the two hubs in the CBD on Wednesday as the city faced yet another Covid-19 outbreak and the prospect of more restrictions. For weeks the mass vaccination hub at the Royal Exhibition Building in Carlton had been relatively idle, with few of those in the eligible phases, such as those over the age of 50, turning up to get the AstraZeneca vaccine. But a day after Victoria recorded six new Covid cases in Melbourne’s northern suburbs linked to a man who caught the infection from hotel quarantine in South Australia, the queue was stretching down the side of the building, with about 100 people waiting by mid-morning. “I assume a lot more people turned up today because of what’s going on in Melbourne,” said Nick, who waited in the queue for his jab for 40 minutes past his appointment time. “I actually live nearby, and I come around here quite often, and it’s been quite empty … but it seems like people are getting fired up a bit, which is good.” Read more of Josh Taylor’s report here: Melbourne’s vaccination hubs see long queues as city responds to Covid outbreak Right now now on the NHS England website it looks like you qualify to book a jab if you are: aged 30 and over will turn 30 before 1 July 2021 That’s in addition to the other categories: people at high risk from Covid-19 (clinically extremely vulnerable) people who live or work in care homes health and social care workers people with a condition that puts them at higher risk (clinically vulnerable) people with a learning disability people who are a main carer for someone at high risk from Covid-19 You can book your shot here. Other nations in the UK can find out the latest status for booking a vaccine here: NHS Scotland Gov.wales Northern Ireland If you are a Westminster-watcher then there is only one game in town in the UK this morning – the anticipation for Dominic Cummings being quizzed by MPs about the way the UK handled the early days of the pandemic. Our political correspondent Aubrey Allegretti writes: On the eve of the evidence session, Cummings continued to add to a 63-tweet long thread on Twitter, claiming one of the “worst failings” last year was the “almost total absence of a serious plan for shielding/social care” and adding: “There was widespread delusion we HAD a great plan. It turned out to barely exist.” He also hinted he plans to shine a light on an alleged but firmly denied government strategy of “herd immunity”, meaning enough people gaining resistance to a virus that it no longer spreads unchecked. He has also promised to provide a “crucial” document on Covid decision-making to the health and science committees chaired by two Tory MPs, Jeremy Hunt and Greg Clark. Whether the public will pay as much heed to a man whose pandemic contribution will mainly be remembered for his flight from London during lockdown remains to be seen.

Here’s some news that may significantly alter life for tourists and the attractiveness of business hub Dubai – the United Arab Emirates said vaccinations against Covid-19 will be mandatory for people attending all “live events” from 6 June. The policy applies to all sports, cultural, social, arts exhibition, activities and events, a spokeswoman for the ministry of health said late on Tuesday. Attendees must also present a negative Covid-19 PCR test taken at least 48 hours before the event. The policy also appears to apply for weddings of up to 100 people. Reuters report that the country’s vaccination campaign has consistently been one of the fastest in the world and the UAE said more than 78.11% of the eligible population over 16 years old had now been vaccinated. It wasn’t specified if this was one or two doses. That’s it from me, Helen Sullivan, for today. Thanks for following along – and stay tuned for more updates from my esteemed colleague Martin Belam. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 2,626 to 3,656,177, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Wednesday. The reported death toll rose by 270 to 87,726, the tally showed. Lockdowns in some of the world’s poorest countries have seen schools close, households lose their incomes, and, in some cases, a growth in domestic abuse. The result, according to a report, has been a rise in child labour, as children like Gopal have found themselves in often precarious and exploitative work, with long hours, low pay, and scant regard for safety. Jo Becker, director at Human Rights Watch (HRW), which co-published the report with the Initiative for Social and Economic Rights in Uganda and Friends of the Nation in Ghana, said: “The key driver is the economic situation that so many families are facing because they have lost jobs, they have lost income. The lockdowns in many countries have really dealt a blow.” The Guardian’s Lizzy Davies and Pete Pattisson report: India’s total coronavirus infections crossed 27 million on Wednesday, swelled by 208,921 new cases over the last 24 hours, while daily deaths from Covid-19 rose by 4,157, Reuters reports. The South Asian country’s overall caseload is now at 27.16 million, while total fatalities are at 311,388, according to health ministry data. The US and other countries have called for a more in-depth investigation of the pandemic origins, after an international mission to China earlier this year proved inconclusive. Addressing the World Health Organization’s main annual meeting of member states in Geneva, representatives from several countries stressed the continued need to solve the mystery of how Covid-19 first began spreading among humans. “We underscore the importance of a robust comprehensive and expert-led inquiry into the origins of Covid-19,” US representative Jeremy Konyndyk told the meeting on Tuesday. Australia, Japan and Portugal were among other countries to call for more progress on the investigation, while the British representative urged for any probe to be “timely, expert-driven and grounded in robust science”. Determining how the virus that causes Covid-19 began spreading is seen as vital to preventing future outbreaks: The coronavirus variant first detected in India has now been officially recorded in 53 territories, a World Health Organization report showed Wednesday, AFP reports. Additionally, the WHO has received information from unofficial sources that the B.1.617 variant has been found in seven other territories, figures in the UN health agency’s weekly epidemiological update showed, taking the total to 60. The report said B.1.617 had shown increased transmissibility, while disease severity and risk of infection were under investigation. Globally over the past week, the number of new cases and deaths continued to decrease, with around 4.1 million new cases and 84,000 new deaths reported - a 14 percent and two percent decrease respectively compared to the previous week. The WHO’s European region reported the largest decline in new cases and deaths in the past seven days, followed by the southeast Asia region. The numbers of cases reported by the Americas, Eastern Mediterranean, Africa, and the Western Pacific region were similar to those reported in the previous week. “Despite a declining global trend over the past four weeks, incidence of Covid-19 cases and deaths remain high, and substantial increases have been observed in many countries throughout the world,” the document said. Hello and welcome to today’s live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. The coronavirus variant first detected in India has now been officially recorded in 53 territories, a World Health Organization report showed Wednesday. Additionally, the WHO has received information from unofficial sources that the B.1.617 variant has been found in seven other territories, figures in the UN health agency’s weekly epidemiological update showed, taking the total to 60. Meanwhile the United States and other countries have called for a more in-depth investigation of the pandemic origins, after an international mission to China earlier this year proved inconclusive. Here are the other key recent developments: At least 77,000 hospital staff in England caught coronavirus during the pandemic, while there were nearly a quarter of a million absences for Covid-related reasons, Guardian research has revealed. The number of people with Covid-19 in intensive care units in France fell by another 49 to 3,447 on Tuesday, while the overall number of people in hospital with the virus fell by 271 to 19,430. The Biden administration has reaffirmed its support for Tokyo’s plan to hold the Olympic Games this summer despite a new wave of coronavirus cases and the US urging its citizens to avoid all travel to Japan. Poland will launch a lottery with prizes of as much as 1m zlotys ($273,000) to encourage people to get vaccinated against Covid-19, the minister in charge of the immunisation programme has said. UK trade with the EU collapsed by nearly a quarter at the start of 2021 compared with three years before as Brexit and Covid-19 disruption hit exports, while China replaced Germany as the biggest single import market, according to official figures.","charCount":"78271","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/lucy-campbell\">Lucy Campbell</a> (now); <a href=\"profile/mattha-busby\">Mattha Busby</a>, <a href=\"profile/damien-gayle\">Damien Gayle</a>, <a href=\"profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a>  and <a href=\"profile/helen-sullivan\">Helen Sullivan</a> (earlier)"},{"headline":"Villarreal beat Manchester United in Europa League final: player ratings","standfirst":"<p>Scott McTominay battled in vain but Raúl Albiol and Pau Torres summed up Villarreal’s solid resistance</p>","trailText":"Scott McTominay battled in vain but Raúl Albiol and Pau Torres summed up Villarreal’s solid resistance","byline":"Andy Hunter","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fecbb46dadc4079d7984785a5ac2da4b3b4a9ff5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fecbb46dadc4079d7984785a5ac2da4b3b4a9ff5/0_270_4374_2625/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manchester United’s Scott McTominay is challenged by Dani Parejo of Villarreal - both midfielders had excellent games in the Europa League final.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Manchester United’s Scott McTominay is challenged by Dani Parejo of Villarreal - both midfielders had excellent games in the Europa League final.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Boris Streubel/Uefa/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<h2>Manchester United (4-2-3-1)</h2> <p><strong>David de Gea</strong> Beaten by an awkward bounce on goal but had little to do until the until the final, decisive penalty kick. <strong>6</strong></p> <p><strong>Aaron Wan-Bissaka</strong> Strong and sharp in the tackle as always, but more was required creatively in the final third. <strong>6</strong></p> <p><strong>Eric Bailly</strong> Effective one moment, a worry the next.

Last year’s pandemic Proms were overshadowed by a row over a plan to have orchestral versions of Rule, Britannia! and Land of Hope and Glory on the last night.

Here’s an impassioned Marcus Rashford talking after the game</strong></p> <p>“The feeling inside is difficult to explain. We came here to win - we’ve worked so hard all season and this was the opportunity to win a trophy, and it didn’t happen. We have to get rid of the disappointment and then look back at the game to see what we did wrong and where we can improve.</p> <p>“This team will not give up. There’s no chance that the teams gives up. The manager will not give up, he’ll not allow us to give up. We’ll come next season with a bigger desire. People say a lot about Manchester United: ‘they’re going downhill, blah blah blah blah blah’. For me, the hunger, desire, talent and ability... we have everything to compete at the highest level. We just have to show it to the world and to ourselves, that we belong in the top places. </p> <p>“We need to be winning finals like this. In the league we finished second. Second doesn’t count for nothing. Villarreal won the Europa League, we finished second. I don’t want to hear it: ‘Oh, they were so close.’ There’s one winner and one loser, and today we lost. We have to find out why and make sure next time we don’t lose.</p> <p>“I’m 100 per cent sure [we have the right characters to win things]. I’ve seen the sacrifices in the dressing-room. I could walk you in there and show you five, six, seven players, and me as well, who’ve been playing with injuries since September. We all stick together and fight for this club. We have to go away now and clear our heads, and next year we come back fresh.</p> <p>“When Ole came in there was a process, and we as players believe in that. This isn’t the end of the process. Part of it is having ups and downs, and we’ve had plenty of both. Just because we lost today, I promise the fans we will not give up. There’s no chance. I promise we are close to success. But close isn’t good enough.”</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60aed0118f088d8c3178a3ad\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-05-26T22:47:49.661Z\">11.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\"> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/may/26/manchester-united-trapped-suspended-reality-sum-up-season-scrappy-europa-league-final-villarreal\">Inert United, trapped in suspended reality, sum up season in scrappy final  | Jonathan Liew</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60aecc378f086d71cc15bc8a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-05-26T22:45:56.231Z\">11.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>That’s it for tonight’s blog. </strong>I’ll leave you with Jamie Jackson’s match report.

That’s football: sometimes it’s decided on one kick. We’ve got to taste this feeling and make sure we don’t get it again. We didn’t turn up, we didn’t play as well as we can. We started all right; they got the goal with their only shot on target, and we’re disappointed to concede again on a set piece. We pushed, we pressed, we got the goal, but after that we couldn’t control the game. </p> <p>“They made it hard for us. They closed the spaces and defended well. We didn’t create enough big chances. Now is not the time to discuss what I might have done differently, but when you go home without a trophy you haven’t done everything right.</p> <p>“We’re getting closer and closer. We were one kick away tonight, but we’ve got to come back next year and make sure we improve again. The only way to get the fine margins on your side is to work harder and better. </p> <p><em>“[Can you call this season successful] </em>No. <em>[How do you make the next step?] </em>We need to get better, simple as. We had a difficult start with no pre-season. We got closer to the top and we got the final, but you need to win these finals.</p> <p>“[<em>Do you have the characters in the dressing-room to win things?]</em> Yes, of course. We missed two big one today with Fred [who wasn’t fit enough to start] and Harry. We’re building a strong, competitive squad, and the spirit is really good. They’re gutted in there.

He talks about momentum but they surrendered all of it. And don’t get me started on changing players from game to game. That’s two seasons now they’ve run out of legs - not just this season. I am not blaming anyone for a penalty shootout at 11-10 either.”</p> <p>I’m not sure they ran out of legs; they looked much fitter in the second half tonight. The delayed substitutions were fairly hard to understand though, because they got very tired in extra time.

Styles make fights - but so do backstories, and when this match kicks off the score will be Villarreal 0-45 Manchester United. That’s the number of major trophies won by each side. Villarreal have never been in a major final before, at home or in Europe, and even the newspaper formerly known as the Manchester Guardian appreciates how beautiful it will be if they win tonight. </p> <p>It’s tempting to think of this game, historically at least, as David v Goliath. If that’s the case, it comes with a twist. Villarreal are managed by Unai Emery, who has won this competition a record-equalling three times, whereas Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has never been close to a European final before. There are unconfirmed reports that, if Villarreal win tonight, Emery will get to keep the trophy and Uefa will pay tribute by commissioning a replacement in the shape of his face.</p> <p>A Europa League victory is in the eye of the beholder. For Villarreal, this match is the be-all and end-all, a chance of instant immortality. United want it to be the start of something - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOTcJJS2oic\">a gate to the shining uplands, like the FA Cup wins of 1963 and 1990</a> and the League Cup victory in 2006. (Let’s not dwell on the FA Cup triumphs of 1977 and 2016, which weren’t so much the gate to the shining uplands as the door to the Jobcentre for Tommy Docherty and Louis van Gaal.)</p> <p>In March, Solskjaer talked negatively, though not unreasonably, about how trophies can be “an ego trip” for managers that can hide a lack of progress. Of far greater importance is the positive ego trip for players; a whiff of glory, and freshly polished silver, can empower and stimulate an emerging team to reach the giddiest of stratospheres. </p> <p>Trouble is, there are two sides to every glory. Tonight, as in all finals except the occasional reality TV stinker, somebody has to lose. Eek.</p> <p><strong>Kick off </strong>9pm in Gdansk and Villarreal, 8pm in Manchester.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-05-26T18:47:11.956Z\">at 7.47pm BST</time></p>  </div>","wordcount":"7730","firstPublicationDate":"2021-05-26T16:30:03Z","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2021-05-26T23:59:29Z","liveBloggingNow":"false","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/p/hhgjc","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/556b109906a52651b1da309dcc9365963185a8d5/0_377_6002_3602/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","isLive":"true","bodyText":"Wait, pssst, come back! Here’s an impassioned Marcus Rashford talking after the game “The feeling inside is difficult to explain. We came here to win - we’ve worked so hard all season and this was the opportunity to win a trophy, and it didn’t happen. We have to get rid of the disappointment and then look back at the game to see what we did wrong and where we can improve. “This team will not give up. There’s no chance that the teams gives up. The manager will not give up, he’ll not allow us to give up. We’ll come next season with a bigger desire. People say a lot about Manchester United: ‘they’re going downhill, blah blah blah blah blah’. For me, the hunger, desire, talent and ability... we have everything to compete at the highest level. We just have to show it to the world and to ourselves, that we belong in the top places. “We need to be winning finals like this. In the league we finished second. Second doesn’t count for nothing. Villarreal won the Europa League, we finished second. I don’t want to hear it: ‘Oh, they were so close.’ There’s one winner and one loser, and today we lost. We have to find out why and make sure next time we don’t lose. “I’m 100 per cent sure [we have the right characters to win things]. I’ve seen the sacrifices in the dressing-room. I could walk you in there and show you five, six, seven players, and me as well, who’ve been playing with injuries since September. We all stick together and fight for this club. We have to go away now and clear our heads, and next year we come back fresh. “When Ole came in there was a process, and we as players believe in that. This isn’t the end of the process. Part of it is having ups and downs, and we’ve had plenty of both. Just because we lost today, I promise the fans we will not give up. There’s no chance. I promise we are close to success. But close isn’t good enough.” That’s it for tonight’s blog. I’ll leave you with Jamie Jackson’s match report. Thanks for your company and emails, and congratulations to Villarreal on an historic achievement. 26 May 2021 will forever belong to them, and there’s nothing Dominic Cummings or anyone else can do about it. Night! Ole Gunnar Solskjaer speaks “The dressing-room is quiet, disappointed. That’s football: sometimes it’s decided on one kick. We’ve got to taste this feeling and make sure we don’t get it again. We didn’t turn up, we didn’t play as well as we can. We started all right; they got the goal with their only shot on target, and we’re disappointed to concede again on a set piece. We pushed, we pressed, we got the goal, but after that we couldn’t control the game. “They made it hard for us. They closed the spaces and defended well. We didn’t create enough big chances. Now is not the time to discuss what I might have done differently, but when you go home without a trophy you haven’t done everything right. “We’re getting closer and closer. We were one kick away tonight, but we’ve got to come back next year and make sure we improve again. The only way to get the fine margins on your side is to work harder and better. “[Can you call this season successful] No. [How do you make the next step?] We need to get better, simple as. We had a difficult start with no pre-season. We got closer to the top and we got the final, but you need to win these finals. “[Do you have the characters in the dressing-room to win things?] Yes, of course. We missed two big one today with Fred [who wasn’t fit enough to start] and Harry. We’re building a strong, competitive squad, and the spirit is really good. They’re gutted in there. Now isn’t the time to analyse the whole season.” “Bitterly disappointed but not surprised,” says Ruth Purdue. “Ole is shocking about subs and has been from the start. He talks about momentum but they surrendered all of it. And don’t get me started on changing players from game to game. That’s two seasons now they’ve run out of legs - not just this season. I am not blaming anyone for a penalty shootout at 11-10 either.” I’m not sure they ran out of legs; they looked much fitter in the second half tonight. The delayed substitutions were fairly hard to understand though, because they got very tired in extra time. But I think that’s an issue within the game rather than over the whole season. Anyone seen Donny van de Beek? It turns out that Manchester United’s gate to the shining uplands had a barbed-wire fence behind it. They’ve still had a good season but this is a seriously bitter blow which could - could - stymie them if they don’t start well in August. Some final defeats come with no regrets. Ten years ago this week, United were hammered by a Barcelona team at their absolute peak. There’s been a bit of talk about Fergie getting his tactics wrong, but in reality that game was unwinnable. There were regrets against the same team two years earlier, over the suspension of Darren Fletcher, the missed early chances and the concession of such a cheap goal that allowed Barcelona to start the passing carousel. And there will be a lot of regrets tonight - the cheap goal, the delayed substitutions, the lack of intensity for much of the game. They’ve looked a gift trophy in the mouth. There’s a Villarreal fan, a ruddy-faced fella who looks like he could keep a stiff upper lip at a family funeral, weeping openly as he watches his players, his team, go up to collect the trophy. It’s a beautiful scene, a deluxe version of Leicester’s FA Cup celebrations. Mario Gaspar, the club captain, and the team captain Raul Albiol are last in line. They accept their medals, grab the trophy and lift it as high in the air as possible to signal that Villarreal have won the Europa League! The penalties happened so fast, and our system kept freezing, so I didn’t really have time to describe them. Most were excellent, though a couple (Shaw and another that I’ve forgotten) should have been saved. David de Gea, sad to say, had a stinker. I don’t mean his miss; that can happen to anyone and he shouldn’t be in that position anyway. But he barely looked like going the right way on the Villarreal penalties, never mind saving one. In hindsight, Dean Henderson - who has greater presence and arrogance - should have been brought on in the 123rd minute, like Tim Krul at the 2014 World Cup. It’s easy to say that now. United walk up to collect their losers medals. Bruno Fernandes doesn’t even look at his, Luke Shaw takes his off straight away, as do most of the other players. “Hello Rob,” says Kári Tulinius. “Considering how much stick Emery got as Arsenal manager, it feels like he’s due a some positive coverage in the anglophone media. Every Villarreal player knew exactly what to do at all times, even when under sustained pressure, which is always a sign of a good manager.” Agreed. He’s clearly an extremely good manager, especially when it comes to punching up. Unai Emery outcoached Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, as much as anything in his use of substitutes. The tactics were also bespoke, with sometimes as many as eight players in a line on the edge of the area, but United asked for trouble by conceding the first goal. They had a really good spell after Edinson Cavani, when it looked like they would overwhelm a tired Villarreal, but the substitutions (and lack thereof) changed the game and United let extra-time pass them by. The margins are so fine. For all the regrets and frustration, United would probably have won had Dean Henderson been in goal for the penalty shoot-out. But it was clear after about 94 minutes that United need fresh legs and fresh minds, ideally Juan Mata or Donny van de Beek. Solskjaer has had an extremely good season, but this was a really bad night. Bruno Fernandes is in tears. He didn’t have his best game, though Villarreal’s dense low block made it very hard for him. It was a poor match, and Villarreal - quite rightly - will not give a solitary toss about any of that. They’ve won their first trophy and, while their defensive performance might not meet Danny Blanchflower’s threshold of glory, it will satisfy most people’s. And Unai Emery has now won four Europa Leagues. That might be David de Gea’s last kick for United, which is especially cruel - not to mention weird - for a goalkeeper. The United players look a bit numb, while the Villarreal players are having the most euphoric moments of their professional lives. This is a glorious story for a very likeable club, and there are tears on both sides of the advertising boards as their players salute the fans. Villarreal have won the first trophy in their history! David de Gea placed the penalty to his right, but Rullui went the right way, got hands on it - and this time it didn’t sneak under him! Rulli saves from de Gea!!!! Another spectacular penalty! It’s 10-10! Rulli got hands on it but it was too high and too powerful. Another sensational penalty from a defender. Another supremely nonchalant penalty! All 1 penalties have been scored! An awful penalty but it somehow sneaks under Rulli! Caressed into the top corner, a tender Pressman. What a penalty! Dear me, we’re almost at the goalkeepers. Another nerveless penalty. Which poor bugger is up next for United? I’ll be honest, I was preparing the text for him to miss. That was a cracking penalty. Straight down the middle. Now we’re into actual sudden death. Boomed into the net, with de Gea moving late. And now Villarreal are at match point. A delightfully cool penalty. It’s effectively sudden death. A brilliant penalty, crashed into the bottom-right corner. De Gea went the right way but was nowhere near it. Yikes. Rulli got a hand on that as well, but it sneaked into the net. So close! De Gea went the right way and got a hand on it, but it sneaked into the net. Another good penalty; Rulli went the wrong way. de Gea, whose penalty record isn’t great, again goes the wrong way. Rulli went the right way but it was really well struck. Lovely penalty. He sat de Gea down and slid it in the other corner. Gerard Moreno walks forward Here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go, this is it Villarreal have won the toss and will bat go first That’s usually a decent advantage. “It seems a bit late in the season,” says Gerry Scott, “for United to stop taking the Europa League seriously.” Arf. And so to penalties. 123 min Villarreal make their sixth change - Capoue off, Dani Raba on. 123 min United make two substitutions with penalties in mind: Juan Mata and Alex Telles come on for Aaron Wan-Bissaka and the admirable Scott McTominay. 120 min Three minutes of added time. Villarreal look much fresher, which few of us saw coming after 90 minutes. 120 min United have Juan Mata ready to come on for penalties, if the ball goes out of play. Donny van de Beek has reportedly been seen in Selfridges on Oxford Street. 119 min Now Luke Shaw is receiving treatment after being accidentally kneed in the face by Coquelin. He’s had a strong game again, particularly during that second-half spell during which it looked like United would overwhelm Villarreal. 119 min “Oh dear,” says Jim Fulton. “Can’t we break for a nap? Pick up in the morning?” 119 min Spoiler: it’s going to penalties. 118 min If United lose on penalties, they will have regrets over this extra-time period, which has completely passed them by. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has been far too passive in my eternally humble opinion. 117 min United now have Rashford left, James right, Fernandes behind Cavani and Mata and van de Beek IN THEIR BLOODY TRACKSUITS. 116 min Two changes for United. Axel Tuanzebe replaces Eric Bailly, who has pulled something I think, and Daniel James is on for Paul Pogba. NO PENALTY! That Gerard Moreno shot hit Fred’s hand in the area, but he was so close to Moreno and VAR isn’t interested. 114 min: VAR CHECK FOR A VILLARREAL PENALTY! 114 min Cavani is booked for complaining about that challenge on McTominay. It looked like a standard barge, albeit a snide one off the ball. 113 min Alberto Moreno flattens McTominay off the ball. Play continues and Gerard Moreno has a shot desperately blocked! United are suddenly hanging on a wee bit. 112 min Alberto Moreno plays a really good pass into Alcacer in the area. He is about to shoot when McTominay makes a good - and almost exaggeratedly careful - challenge from the side. I think he’s been United’s best player. 111 min Rashford is back on. 111 min A weary Rashford leaves the field limping slightly. 110 min Daniel James is about to come on. Donny van de Beek and Juan Mata are not. 109 min A long angled pass almost falls for Rashford, who gets the wrong side of Albiol but is beaten to the ball by Rulli. Rashford is now down and in need of treatment. 107 min Rulli comes out of his area to beat Cavani to a through ball. One problem for Solskjaer is that the players who he might want to take off, like Rashford and Pogba, are among his penalty takers. But then so is Juan Mata. 106 min Peep peep! Villarreal begin the second period of extra time. Villarreal’s players get into a huddle before the start of the second period. After a painful second half, they now look the likelier winners. Many of you predicted Villarreal 1-2 Man Utd. But that was supposed to be the score, not the number of shots on target. The first period of extra-time was a non-event for United, who looked tired and a bit timid. Villarreal were the better team and had a couple of half chances. They have made five subs to United’s one, and it’s starting to show. 104 min “Evening Rob,” says Stephen Carr. “Alberto Moreno already running the show here.” He’s been comically wired. If it goes to penalties, I hope he takes one. It’ll be a Pressman or a Stam, nothing inbetween. 103 min Parejo’s corner is headed out and United break. Fernandes launches a dangerous pass towards Rashford, but the last man Capoue comes across to head clear. 101 min This is Villarreal’s best spell of the match by a distance. Bailly fouls somebody in yellow on the left wing, which allows Parejo to address a dead ball once more. His awkward, deep inswinger is slapped behind for a corner by de Gea. 101 min United do make a change, and it’s the one they all wanted: Fred replaces Mason Greenwood. That means Pogba moves to the left and Rashford to the right. 100 min: Half chance for Alcacer! Another warning for United. Pogba loses the ball in a dangerous area, and Moreno slips a good pass through to Alcacer in the area. He sweeps a first-time shot over the bar. 100 min United need to make a substitution or three. They suddenly look really tired and have barely had an attack in the first 10 minutes of extra time. 99 min Gomez runs at a backpedalling defence and finds Alberto Moreno on the left of the area. He sprays a shot wide of the near post. That was a chance to make himself a Liverpool legend all over again. 98 min Thanks to Timn de Lisle for pointing out that it was Rashford, not Fernandes, whose volley led to Cavani’s equaliser. No idea how I mixed them up. 97 min United haven’t got going since the start of extra-time. McTominay tries to push things forward with another terrific run through midfield, but nothing comes of it. 94 min Plenty of Villarreal possession at the start of extra time. Bailly makes an important interception to stop Coquelin’s pass putting Moreno through on goal, but Villarreal win it back and Moreno plays a sharp pass into Alcacer in the area. He takes a touch and has a shot that is well blocked by Bailly. 93 min For all United’s dominance, especially in the second half, they have only had two shots on target in the match. 92 min Fernandes chops away from Coquelin on the left edge of the area and hits a shot that is headed away by the indomitable Albiol. 92 min “Has Rashford played himself out of Southgate’s first XI?” says Max Williams. “It’s been a tough night for him.” I’m not sure he was in it anyway. I think the front three might be Sancho, Kane and Foden. Rashford’s form has been iffy for a while now, though we should cut him a bit of slack – for a few different reasons, it’s been an exhausting season. 91 min Peep peep! United begin the first period of extra time. Still no substitutions from United, though we’ll surely see Mata and/or van de Beek at some stage. Extra-time it is. The two goals were scored by the two goalscorers: Gerard Moreno in the first half, Edinson Cavani in the second. 90+3 min Alberto Moreno, who looks more than a little pumped up, makes a couple of very strong challenges on Greenwood. And that’s it! 90+2 min Fernandes fouls Moi Gomez 45 yards from goal, which allows Villarreal to work another training-ground set-piece. It’s sprayed very deep and picked up by the unmarked Mario Gaspar near the byline. He plays it back to Torres, who sprays over from 15 yards with his left foot. That was half a chance. 90+2 min Though Rashford has had a poor game on the ball, his work rate off it has been beyond reproach. He and Shaw have won the ball back in dangerous areas on a number of occasions. 90+1 min Three minutes of added time, on the 26th May. 90 min “Hi Rob,” says Michael Guggenheim. “In all MBMs there are always the same people who have a say. Mary Waltz, Charles Antaki, Kari Tulinius. Do these people exist? Do you all just use the same five names for whomever mails in, to make your job easier? Do many more people mail in and you just ignore all the others? Does noone ever mail in, and you just make this all up? Yours, Charles Waltz.” Definately. 89 min Pogba misses a half chance, heading Shaw’s loopy cross over the bar from 10 yards. 88 min Villarreal make their fourth and fifth substitutions. Alberto Moreno, Liverpool legend, comes on for Alfonso Pedraza at left-back, and Mario Gaspar replaces Juan Foyth on the other side. Villarreal have made five substitutions to United’s none, which tells a story. United still look fresh and hungry, especially McTominay, Rashford and Shaw. 86 min McTominay roars through midfield and plays a good pass out to Rashford. He overruns it and is tackled by Foyth, but United snap at Villarreal to win the ball back. 86 min The free-kick is just outside the area on the left wing. Fernandes floats it deep, Lindelof misses an attempted overhead kick, McTominay controls it with his arm and then Rashford shoots miles wide from distance. Tremendously done. 84 min Rashford plays an excellent pass down the line to Shaw, who fizzes a low cross to the near post. Greenwood and Cavani get in each other’s way, but the referee pulls play back for a poor lunging tackle by Foyth on Shaw. He is booked. 83 min Bailly, who might have been booked early on, gets a yellow card for a foul on Alcacer. 81 min We’re just seeing a replay of Cavani’s goal. The most impressive thing was his awareness of offside; the second the ball was headed clear, he sprinted as quickly away from goal as quickly as possible. Most strikers wouldn’t have bothered, and the goal wouldn’t have counted. 81 min Rashford cuts inside from the left but then shoots wide of the near post. That was the wrong option. 80 min “You just can’t see how this Villarreal side can hurt Manchester United,” says Robbie Savage, whose contact details will be available for a small fee when David Hindle’s scenario (78 min) comes to pass. 79 min Rashford nicks the ball off Foyth and tries to stab a pass through to Cavani. Albiol reads it really well and intercepts. He and Pau Torres have been outstanding. Moments later, McTominay - who has had a terrific game - charges into the area on the right and drives a low cross that is missed by Cavani at the near post and put behind by Albiol. Cavani tried to flick a shot behind his standing leg. 78 min “You have to admit, there is a fair amount of malodorous stuff on a twig in this game,” says David Hindle. “But it’s the Spanish side, 9-1-0 formation and all, producing it. They’ve obviously learnt how to win these European finals. There’s a delicious irony in there, somewhere, isn’t there? Or at least there will be when they get their last-minute winner from a shanked, deflected, shot off the post that rebounds in off the keeper’s head, after eight goalline clearances, lots of ugly blocks and other awfulness of their own.” 77 min They’re making a third change as well: Moi Gomez on, Manu Trigueros off. 77 min Nothing comes of the second corner, so Villarreal make their second substitution: Paco Alcacer replaces the impressive 18-year-old Yeremi Pino. 76 min A corner to Villarreal. Pogba heads clear, but Trigueros’s long-range follow-up spins behind for another. 74 min “Mary Waltz clearly never watched Cavani perform wonders for Napoli when, amongst many other superb goals, he scored a cracker against Man City in a Champions League match,” says Colum Fordham. “He’s a brilliant striker as I was lucky to witness at the San Paolo, now the Maradona stadium.” I think everyone knew he was brilliant. But they also knew he was 33, had missed lots of football since turning 30 and was signed a split second before the transfer window made that slamming noise. 73 min United have been so much better in the second half. Villarreal have been hanging on for a while now and are starting to look weary. Mind you, we said the same about Romania against England at the 1998 World Cup. 71 min: Great block from Torres! Shaw turns Capoue smartly on the left edge of the area, then hits an optimistic right-footed shot. It’s miles off target but flies straight towards Cavani, whose improvised header is blocked by the head of Torries in the six-yard box. I don’t think Rulli would have saved that. 70 min: RASHFORD MISSES A SITTER! Cavani released Fernandes on the right. He drove a perfect low cross to Rashford, who slid the ball wide from eight yards. It was a terrible miss, an almost nonchalant finish, but I don’t think it would have counted. I’m pretty sure Fernandes was just offside in the build up. 68 min ... and it’s headed away by somebody in yellow. 67 min Capoue, who is a yellow, trips the increasingly influential Fernandes. The free-kick is 25 yards from goal, in line with the left edge of the penalty area... 66 min McTominay’s shot from 20 yards is blocked by Trigueros. Meanwhile, replays show Fernandes’s cross in the 64th minute hit Torres’s elbow, but his arm was by his side and he was trying to move it behind his back. Not even Paddy Crerand would give a penalty for that. 65 min No sign of VAR getting involved in that penalty appeal. United continue to probe - or, as the fans are chanting, “attack attack attack”. The match has been very one-sided in terms of possession, though not chances. 64 min United appeal unsuccessfully for a penalty when Fernandes’s cross hits Torres somewhere near the arm. His arms were by his side so even if it hit one of them, I don’t think that’s a penalty. 64 min It’s been said before, it’ll be said again: the next goal is huge. 63 min Wan-Bissaka enlivens the United fans in the stadium with a storming challenge on Pedraza. Another WB, Wesley Brown, used to make tackles like that at right-back. 62 min “When United signed Cavani I yawned,” says Mary Waltz. “Was there any pundit who predicted the massive effect on United’s fortunes when they landed him?” Not that I recall. I thought it was a desperate, Glazernomic signing. Turns out he’s still a beautiful, brilliant beast of a centre-forward. 61 min “Rob, what is the point of Paul Pogba?” says Adam Roberts. “Asking for a friend.” I think he’s been okay tonight, though I much prefer him on the left in this team. 60 min A change for Villarreal: Francis Coquelin, once of Arsenal, replaces Carlos Bacca. That should mean a switch to 4-5-1. 59 min Robbie Savage, on BT Sport, makes the point that McTominay deserves a lot of credit for the goal, as the corner stemmed from his persistence when it looked like Villarreal had cleared the danger. 57 min United are flying now. Fernandes drives well wide from 20 yards after McTominay fresh-airs a shot on the edge of the area. This is very tight. Cavani really scarpered away from goal after the headed clearance in an attempt to ensure he was onside. And he made it: the goal is given! VAR CHECK FOR OFFSIDE! Shaw’s corner was headed away to Fernandes Rashford, 25 yards out. His volley took a couple of deflections and fell perfectly for Cavani, who rolled it into the empty net. Rulli had already dived to his right in an attempt to save Fernandes’s volley, so it was essentially an open goal for Cavani. The big man scores in his first European final! 54 min Shaw’s free-kick is headed back across goal by Pogba to McTominay. He is challenged but does really well to keep the ball alive and hit a shot on the turn that is deflected over for a corner. From which... 54 min Capoue is booked for pulling back Fernandes. We haven’t seen a decent replay of the penalty appeal yet, but there were no real appeals or complaints from United. 52 min: VAR CHECK FOR UNITED PENALTY Greenwood goes down in the area after a challenge from Pedraza. It was a high ball, and there was a clash of boots as the ball was kicked. Pedraza must have got to it just before Greenwood; VAR says no penalty. 50 min Wan-Bissaka, one of the few United players able to find any space in the final third, has a decent low cross cleared by Torres at the near post. 48 min Pedraza’s deflected cross leads to an almighty scramble on the six-yard line before Bailly hacks it clear. Good job he did, because the trouble started when he missed an attempted overhead kick from that Pedraza cross. 47 min “Unai Emery has a face which would suit an evil chuckle, but he never really got the chance for one at Arsenal,” says Charles Antaki. “I’m sure that Arsenal fans wouldn’t begrudge him one here.” 46 min Peep peep! The second half is under way, with no changes on either side. “If it stays 1-0, at what point does Solskjaer bring himself on?” says Matt Dony, joyously high-fiving everyone in the bar and to hell with Covid guidelines. “And, how many other people have made this same joke?” Some terrific analysis from Rio Ferdinand on BT Sport, who shows that Villarreal’s goal was straight from the training ground. Moreno delayed his run - he was actually being marked by Shaw at first - and then ran inbetween Lindelof and Bailly, who was distracted by Albiol, to score. Half-time business Villarreal lead through Gerard Moreno’s 30th goal of the season, an improvised finish after he escaped the dozy Victor Lindelof at a free-kick. United have had most of the possession but Villarreal’s OBOE defence have been pretty comfortable. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s team have come from behind to win 12 games this season. Once more unto the breach, dear Fred, once more. Yes, yes, I know he’s not playing, but once more unto the breach, dear McTominay simply isn’t going to get the job done. Peep peep! 45+1 min Greenwood roasts Pedraza on the right side of the area and hammers a cross towards the near post. It hits Albiol in a very personal space, a very private space, and ricochets into the arms of Rulli. With Cavani behind him, that was vital defending from Albiol. He didn’t know much about it, though the wince on his face suggests he knows plenty about it now. 45 min Rashford wanders over to the right and slips Pedraza with a lovely piece of skill. Then he slides a low ball into the six-yard box that is cleared by the stretching Torres. The cross wasn’t great actually - there was nobody in there - but the run was thrilling. 44 min Villarreal have eight players in a line on the edge of the area as United probe for an opening. One Bank of Eight is the new Two Banks of Four. But when they win the ball, Yeremi leads the counter-attack and wins a corner. He’s been very good. Actually a goalkick was given but it should have been a corner - the cross deflected onto Shaw’s hand and behind. 42 min United have had 63 per cent of the possession, but it’s a deceptive statistic. The first half has goine exactly as Unai Emery would have hoped. 41 min “Good to see Juan Foyth doing well,” says Matt Dony. “I loved watching him when he first came through at Tottenham. He seemed way too skilful and flaky to be a defender, like he should have been a mercurial winger or something. I can’t imagine truly trusting him in defence, but he was always entertaining.” He’s only on loan, so you’ll be able to enjoy him again. 40 min Cavani gets a lucky break off Torres on the left side of the area, but his pass to Rashford is poor and Parejo intercepts. He and Fernandes have been very quiet. 39 min Villarreal are defending on the edge of their area, almost with a back six, and United are struggling to get behind them. If it stays like this, Juan Mata and/or Donny van de Beek will be needed to pick a lock in the second half. 38 min Rashford plays in the underlapping Shaw, whose cross is kneed up in the air by Albiol and claimed by Rulli. Rashford’s ball was slightly overhit, which gave Shaw a lot to do. 36 min An excellent cross from Wan-Bissaka is headed away with calm authority by Raul Albiol. McTominay then surges into the area but slices his cross over the bar. 35 min “It’s fine,” says Neil Carter. “I’m not worried, Mary Waltz isn’t worried, it’ll be fine. RIGHT ROB??!” If I were you, I’d be a bit worried. Villarreal are a streetwise lot, not the sort you want to go behind against. 34 min Solskjaer is off his seat, angrily berating Luke Shaw for something or other. Somewhere in the world, Jose Mourinho smiles knowingly. 33 min United’s tempo is already better. It’s easy to say this is Solskjaer’s fault, but the Treble team, the greatest in United’s history, were the same. Human nature is very strange. 31 min I was just about to type that United looked like a team who needed the usual wake-up call of going 1-0 down. Morning, United! Rise and shine! It stemmed from that Cavani foul. The free-kick was 40 yards from goal in the inside-left channel. Parejo dropped a beautiful ball over the defence, and Moreno got away from Lindelof to force the ball past de Gea on the half-volley. It was rubbish defending from Lindelof, in truth, but the ball from Parejo was terrific and Moreno did well to control his shot on the stretch. In a surprising development, Manchester United have conceded the first goal! 29 min Cavani is spoken to after a late tackle on Parejo. It’s been a dull, scruffy start to the game. 28 min “Sterile Domination,” says Neil Carter. “Good name for a band?” They’re a bit too thrash metal for my taste, although that cover of Back for Good by Take That was surprisingly heart-rending. 27 min Yeremi runs at the backpedalling Lindelof and drives wide from 20 yards. The two teenagers, Yeremi and Greenwood, have been the brighest attackers so far. 27 min Pogba’s cross is just too long for Fernandes, who leaves one on Rulli. That was completely unnecessary, though Rulli made nothing of it. 25 min “After reading today in the Guardian quiz that Rashford has performed the most nutmegs this season, I’m keeping an extra special eye out for one tonight,” says Nas Iqbal. “I can’t imagine he’s topped many other metrics this season but what a stage to get out your party piece!” I knew they should have picked John O’Shea. (Also, Rashford did top one other non-football metric.) 24 min Rashford’s 30-yard shot dips awkwardly in front of Rulli, who holds it confidently. Moments earlier, Greenwood played a superb long pass to find Cavani just inside the area. It was too awkward to volley, even for Cavani, so he tried to push it back jnside to Rashford. Cavani’s touch was too heavy and the ball run through to the keeper. 23 min United struggle to clear the second corner properly. Eventualluy Bacca stands up a rabona cross towards Torres, who heads over from eight yards. It was a difficult chance as he was running away from goal, but Bacca’s rabona cross was nice. 21 min Bailly heads behind for another Villarreal corner. McTominay heads it away as far as Yeremi, whose stinging shot from 20 yards hits McTominay (again) and deflects over the bar. 20 min A cross from the right is headed away as far as Shaw, who whistles a cross-shot wide of the far post. Fernandes, six yards out, almost got a touch on it but was beaten for pace. 19 min United are still having most of the ball, though at the moment their predominance falls under ‘sterile domination’ 18 min Foyth is off the field again. United try to take advantage with an attack down their left, but Shaw is well challenged by Moreno. 17 min Foyth’s nose is bleeding again, though the referee is allowing him to continue. Meanwhile, Raul Albiol leaves one on Cavani and is spoken to by the referee. 16 min Pedraza wins Villarreal’s first corner. Parejo plays it short and then drives it beyond the far post to Parejo, who volleys high and wide on the stretch. It was a neat corner, though, and Parejo was in a lot of space when he arrived late in the box. 14 min The left-back Pedraza plays a one-two on the halfway line, surges into space and is fouled by his former teammate Bailly. He could have been booked for that. 13 min Foyth, sporting a headband and some cloth stuck up his nose, returns to the field. 12 min The corner is headed away, and that’s the end of that. 11 min Pogba stabs a majestic outside-of-the-foot pass out to Greenwood, whose cross is put behind by Capoue. 10 min “Bruno has been a godsend for United,” says Mary Waltz. “He is a great footballer. It is an insult to connect his name to John Travolta in any fashion.If you saw Battlefield Earth you wouldn’t do this to Bruno.” Sorry, I should have made it clearer – Bruno is Pulp Fiction, United are John Travolta. Battlefield Earth is their 6-0 defeat to Accrington Stanley in the 2024 EFL Cup. 10 min A stretcher has been brought on, though I think it’s just a precaution. Foyth is on his feet and has a nosebleed, but he doesn’t look especially groggy. 9 min Foyth slips and falls under Pogba, who accidentally knees him in the head. Pogba immediately waves to the referee to stop play, and Foyth is receiving treatment. 8 min This is a good spell for United, with the last few minutes being played largely in the Villarreal half. 7 min The first shot, in anger or otherwise. Rashford steals the ball on the left wing and lays it back to McTominay, who drags a shot well wide from the edge of the D. 6 min Shaw crosses low to the near post, where Cavani tries to spin away from Raul Albiol. Foyth gets between him and the ball and shepherds it out of play. 5 min Greenwood has made a lively start, regularly coming inside to get involved. 3 min Lots of slow, risk-free passing from both teams in the first few minutes. 2 min Both teams are lining up as expected, 4-2-3-1 for United and 4-4-2 for Villarreal. 1 min Peeeeeeeeeeep peeeeeeeeeeeep! United, in red, kick off from left to right. Both teams are in their home kits. Tense, nervous headache? Don’t worry, the adrenaline will soon get rid of it. It’s time for the 2021 Europa League final! Bruno Fernandes, United’s captain in the absence of Harry Maguire, leads them onto the field. He has done for United what Pulp Fiction did for John Travolta; now it’s time to pick up some awards. The players are in the tunnel. David de Gea is smiling and joking with some of his Spain teammates, a sight to warm the heart of Roy Keane. In his pre-match interviews, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has implied that Fred would have started if he was fully fit. An alternative interpretation is that Fred’s injury last week allowed Solskjaer to swerve the difficult decision whether to leave out Paul Pogba, Marcus Rashford or Mason Greenwood. Another Fulham email “Neil Carter says he’s ‘CROSSING EVERYTHING!!!’ for a United win,” begins Jake Shaffer. “That didn’t work out too well under Moyes. Honk!” ‘And it was all yellow...’ Just over twenty minutes to kick off, and Neil Carter is calmness personified “Evening Rob,” writes Neil. “Attacking line up from Ole. I’ve been asking for this all season. Now I’m going to look stupid aren’t I when we get pumped. CROSSING EVERYTHING!!! Cmon you Reds!!!” “I can identify with the Villarreal fans tonight,” says Richard Hirst. “Eleven years ago I was entering Hamburg’s stadium with tears in my eyes to watch Fulham (never won anything) in the Europa League final against Atletico Madrid, replete with Aguero, Forlan, De Gea (the very same), Reyes etc. We took it to the last minute of extra time; let’s hope Villarreal can go one better.” What, lose on penalties? “Hi Rob,” says Peter Oh. “If the Villareal youngster scores a pearler to leave United in a jam, you could say that Yeremi spoke in class today.” You could indeed. And what better way to set the mood than with a song about a teenager who killed himself! The pre-match thoughts of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer “I feel good, looking forward to it. This is the worst time: all the work is done and we’re just waiting for the boys to go out and express themselves. David [de Gea] did really well in the quarters and semis, and I expect him to be ready for this. Unfortunately Fred has been injured in the week leading up to the game - he trained last night and he’s okay to be on the bench. He was disappointed not to start, but that’s the hard bit of being a manager. “We just have to trust ourselves. This is a reward for all the hard work they’ve done in the last two years. We’ve been getting closer to a final. I want them to play with confidence, play with courage and be the best version of themselves.” I’m going to take a short coffee break. See you in a peedie while. I look forward to an English team being sponsored by Heathrow Third Runway next season. Gerard Moreno is the biggest threat to Manchester United. He will almost certainly start for Spain at Euro 2021, and only Lionel Messi scored more goals in La Liga this season. Santi Cazorla, chatting on BT Sport, says he is “one of the best players in the world”. Harry Maguire is among the United substitutes, though I’m not sure why as he has no chance of playing. Maybe it’s so that he gets a medal if United win. I’ll level with you: I haven’t a clue! Villarreal (4-4-2) Rulli; Foyth, Albiol, Torres Pedraza; Yeremi, Capoue, Parejo, Trigueros; Moreno, Bacca. Substitutes: Asenjo, Mario Gaspar, Funes Mori, Raba, Estupinan, Alcacer, Moreno, Coquelin, Pena, Jaume Costa, Moi Gomez, Nino. Manchester United (4-2-3-1) de Gea; Wan-Bissaka, Bailly, Lindelof, Shaw; McTominay, Pogba; Greenwood, Fernandes, Rashford; Cavani. Substitutes: Grant, Henderson, Maguire, Mata, Amad, Fred, James, Alex Telles, Matic, Williams, van de Beek, Tuanzebe. Referee Clement Turpin (France). Yeremy Pino, the thrilling 18-year-old who scored at Real Madrid on Saturday, starts for Villarreal. But there’s no Samuel Chukwueze, not even on the bench. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has chosen an unusually attacking line-up, with Paul Pogba playing alongside Scott McTominay in the centre of midfield. That’s a risk with a Maguireless defence, and, since you asked, not the team I’d have picked. There are no other surprises - David de Gea and Eric Bailly are preferred to Dean Henderson and Axel Tuanzebe. United have played in seven European finals, which is pretty modest for such a giant club. They have won five (1968, 1991, 1999, 2008, 2017) and lost two, both to Pep Guardiola’s Barcelona (2009, 2011). Anyway, enough of all that guff - the teams are in! Of all the things to love about Villarreal, their kit is right up there. This season’s isn’t quite as good as the Aeroport Castello classic, but I’d still be proud to wheeze my way round a five-a-side pitch in it. And if they win tonight, it will have an enduring cachet. Never happened, Gordon Smith scored. Of United’s likely starters, the only players with experience of a European final (I think) are David de Gea, Paul Pogba and Marcus Rashford. That’s fairly surprising given United won this trophy four years ago. A lot has changed since then. Some of the probable subs have also played in European finals, including Juan Mata, Donny van de Beek and Nemanja Matic. Here’s Paul Doyle’s Fiver, which includes the best and possibly only Gdansk joke I’ve read. “It’s funny,” writes Niall Mullen, though he doesn’t appear to be laughing. “Until recently I had no real feelings towards Villarreal but just this morning I got the overwhelming urge to support them. Go figure.” On today of all days Cliffs Notes: Villarreal This is a really brilliant piece from Sid on what this game means to Villarreal. If they do win, only the most one-eyed United fan will begrudge them. We’ll have a leisurely build up to kick off, including team news at around 6.45pm BST. While United are without Harry Maguire, Villarreal’s exciting Samuel Chukwueze should be fit for at least a place on the bench. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has a few decisions to make, as discussed here. Previously on... 2005-06 Villarreal 0-0 Man Utd Man Utd 0-0 Villarreal 2008-09 Man Utd 0-0 Villarreal Villarreal 0-0 Man Utd The most notable incident in those four games - on reflection, possibly the only incident of any note - was Wayne Rooney being sent off for sarcasm. It really did happen, as demonstrated in the migraine-inducer at the top of this article. Hello and welcome to live coverage of the Europa League final between Villarreal and Manchester United in Gdansk. Styles make fights - but so do backstories, and when this match kicks off the score will be Villarreal 0-45 Manchester United. That’s the number of major trophies won by each side. Villarreal have never been in a major final before, at home or in Europe, and even the newspaper formerly known as the Manchester Guardian appreciates how beautiful it will be if they win tonight. It’s tempting to think of this game, historically at least, as David v Goliath. If that’s the case, it comes with a twist. Villarreal are managed by Unai Emery, who has won this competition a record-equalling three times, whereas Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has never been close to a European final before. There are unconfirmed reports that, if Villarreal win tonight, Emery will get to keep the trophy and Uefa will pay tribute by commissioning a replacement in the shape of his face. A Europa League victory is in the eye of the beholder. For Villarreal, this match is the be-all and end-all, a chance of instant immortality. United want it to be the start of something - a gate to the shining uplands, like the FA Cup wins of 1963 and 1990 and the League Cup victory in 2006. (Let’s not dwell on the FA Cup triumphs of 1977 and 2016, which weren’t so much the gate to the shining uplands as the door to the Jobcentre for Tommy Docherty and Louis van Gaal.) In March, Solskjaer talked negatively, though not unreasonably, about how trophies can be “an ego trip” for managers that can hide a lack of progress. Of far greater importance is the positive ego trip for players; a whiff of glory, and freshly polished silver, can empower and stimulate an emerging team to reach the giddiest of stratospheres. Trouble is, there are two sides to every glory. Tonight, as in all finals except the occasional reality TV stinker, somebody has to lose. Eek. Kick off 9pm in Gdansk and Villarreal, 8pm in Manchester.","charCount":"43092","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/robsmyth\">Rob Smyth</a>"}]

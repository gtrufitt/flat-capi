It’s a tad windy in Paris, and Evans continues to put up a fight against Kecmanovic’s serve. He has a break point at deuce but crashes his shot into the net. Then he lands another with a smash. He can’t keep the ball in on the next one so back to deuce it goes. Then comes another, and Evans continues to chat to himself. Then comes a huge rally, and Evans slowly moves his opponent around the court to break back to 2-4. Now he must serve this one out. Kecmanovic breaks straight back, unaffected by Evans’ mini-revival, he’s 4-1 on up on the Brit and looks assured of the third set. Evans is still living, and he breaks back, charging from the back of the court to leather a winner. It’s still 1-3 in the third but he has hope. His problem is that he is having to do most of his playing from the very back of the court. Going with serve between Thiem and Andujar on Philippe Chatrier. It’s a most even contest. There’s a Serbian contingent roaring on Kecmanovic, but nobody roaring on Dan Evans the plucky Brit. He’s still doing plenty of talking to himself. And more rude words. He’s down 3-0 and in deep trouble. Kecmanovic serves out to get 2-0 up and now Evans is swearing at the umpire, complaining that people are being let into the court while he is serving. He used the f-word. Naughty boy, and he’s getting a spanking here. Dan Evans throwing a wobbler? He is interrupted by a voice from outside the court as he goes to serve, catches the ball. “Astonishing, mate, astonishing,” he shouts at persons unknown. And Kecmanovic has a run on him, breaking in the very first game of the third set. Some big names playing in tonight’s inaugural evening session. Thiem serves out, and wins the first set 6-4, walloping a forehand winner. Kecmanovic lands himself three set points with some excellent play, and eventually serves to love. 1-6 6-3 now, and Evans has trouble on his hands. Kecmanovic, at 5-2 up, attempts to break Evans but the Englishman forces him to serve to level the sets. Evans double faults and leads 40-30, only to win the game with a great forehand. Thiem has control of the first set against Andujar as he goes 5-3 up. His opponent seems flustered; his good play is going unrewarded. He holds the next one and lands his first ace in the process. Thiem will serve out the set. Some resistance from Evans, real speed around the court as he tries to stop Kecmanovic breaking again, and he holds to take it back 2-4 in the second set. A Tim Henman-style punch of the air, but without the blowing on the fingers. Some actualité. It goes 4-1 to Kecmanovic with a good hold of serve. Evans needs to start picking things back up or he will be in trouble in the third set, too. Hello there, here for the next hour. Andujar just saved six break points from Thiem, and it’s 2-3 to the Frenchman. Evans just got one back, so it’s 1-3 in the second set with Kecmanovic. Right, I’m away for some fress. John Brewin with narrate you through the next little bit. Kecmanovic is reading Evans now, chasing down his drops and generally dominating – this is boiling up nicely. Kecmanovic 1-6 3-0 Evans Thiem is such a beautiful mover, and already Andujar is puffing out his cheeks in resignation. But 1-3 and break point down, he runs around a forehand to drive a winner down the line; this game has been going nearly six minutes now, the majority of it Andujar saving break points, and we’ve now been going 11 minutes. Andujar 1-3 Thiem Superb from Kecmanovic, who holds then reads an Evans drop for 0-30 before, on break point, swiping a backhand winner cross-court! Do we got ourselves a ball-game? Kecmanovic 1-6 2-0 Evans Kecmanovic is making a game of the games now, but he’s still getting absolutely served; Evans, who beat Djokovic at Monte Carlo last month, is looking lovely and takes the first set in short order. Kecmanovic 1-6 Evans Back on Chatrier, Andujar had a break-back point against Thiem but failed to convert; he’s on the baord, though, 2-1 down in set one. Kecmanovic fights hard in the sixth game of the match and he’s in it now, a banging forehand down the line resolving a succession of deuces. Kecmanovic 1-5 Evans On court seven, Roberto Bautista Agut – the number 11 seed – is underway. If he’d played in the 80s or 90s he might’ve won one of these in the way that Muster, Bruguera, Gomez, Moya and Kafelnikov all did. But here we are. He trials Vilella Martinez 4-3 on serve. Meanwhile, on Chatrier, a dominant first game from Thiem sees him break Andujar. Evans has got into stride quickly here and looks to have Kecmanovic’s number. There’s not much pop on the Serb’s serve which is allowing yerman to climb right into points, and this first set is almost over. Kecmanovic 0-4 Evans Fognini has beaten Barrera 4,1 and 4. The number 27 seed plays Simon or, more likely, Fucsovics next. Those two tussle on Mathieu presently; Kovinivic has done for Burel 6-3 7-6(8) and must now contemplate Osaka. Anyhow, while I was busy wondering what my girlfriend wife would say if I publicly challenged her ability to have it, Evans was busy holding and breaking. Kecmanovic 0-2 Evans Just last week, Thiem noted that living in a bubble has helped Evans, given he’s previously struggled with the demands of the professional athlete’s lifestyle; Evans was having none of it, retorting that he’d sorted himself well before the pandemic started. “I must be out partying a lot, yeah,” he said. “I’ve done all right outside of the bubble as well. I must have improved a lot inside it for him to say that. I travel with my girlfriend every week. It’s not like you can go out partying with your girlfriend every week. It’s not that I was on my own and single and going nuts when there weren’t bubbles. It’s a strange comment, isn’t it?” Evans and Kecmanovic are knocking up.... Next on Chatrier: the number four seed and defeated finalist in 2018 and 2019, Dominic Thiem, begins his next assault on the trophy. He meets Pablo Andujar. A couple more results: in the men’s competition, Carreno Busta has rinsed Gombos 3,4, and 3, whole in the women’s, Tomljanovic has sorted Kozlova 2 and 4. Osaka hasn’t played a lot lately but she looked pretty good today. I don’t think her footwork is good enough to win here – yet – but her ball-striking was on-point and the relative closeness of the match is down to how well Tig played. Osaka meets Bogdan next. Osaka hollers a come on as she makes 4-2 in the breaker – the ball makes such a lush thump off the middle of her forehand. An error from Tig quickly gives her 5-2 ... but consecutive unforced errors and we’re back on serve. Briefly. Here ceom two more match points.... Next on court six, we’ve got Dan Evans, the British number one, against Minomir Kecmanovic. She meets Burel or Kovinivic next; Kovinivic won the first set 6-3 and it’s 2-2 in the second. Tig is competing hard here, but with a point for a breaker clips over another second serve of questionable power and Osaka quickly punishes. She may well regret that ... but no! A forehand clattered down the line saves the match point that follows, and a fine kicker helps her raise advantage, ceded when an inside-out forehand drops marginally wide ... but what a lob she finds when in front the next time! Tig 4-6 6-6 Osaka Fognini has taken that second set against Barrere to lead 6-4 6-1 1-0 (with a break). On court six, Badosa and Davis are playing a breaker in a topsy-turvy second set; Badosa won the first. But look at Kalinina! She reels off two points in short order and it turns out you can’t loz the first five games of a set and expect to win. She meets Collins or Wang next; Wang has just levelled the match at one set all. ...and Kerber saves it with a glorious backhand slice drop-shot! Egalité! Osaka is whacking it hard now, but Tig is just about sticking with her, while Kalinina finds a devastating forehand to give herself 30-0 against Kerber; she’s nearly there. Back to Chatrier, Tig misses a huge chance with a half-court volley that would’ve got her 15-30; seconds later, the game has gone and Osaka, 5-4 up in the second, needs just one more. Kerber, meanwhile, soon makes 30-all; Kalinina steps on the spot to try and shake her tightness, then serves a double. Eesh. She makes deuce though, then hits through the ball beautifully to raise match point... Fognini is bolting; the number 27 seed came from behind to take the first set of Barrere, but now leads 4-1 in the second. A monstrous forehand down the line breaks Kalinina to 15; it’s taken a while but Kerber is motoring. Still, the qualifier will have one more chance to eject her before we’re back on serve – but first, Kerber must hold. Kalinina 6-2 5-3 Kerber Tig is hanging in there well, but Osaka holds for 3-2, while Kerber has won a second game and Kalinina will now serve for the match a second time. At change of ends, she puts a towel over her head to get into the correct frame of mind. Pablo Carreno Busta, the number 12 seed and a clay-court specialist, has taken set two against Norbert Gombos; he now leads 6-3 6-4 0-1. Kerber has won a game! Kalinina now leads 6-2 5-1. Some reading on Edberg. Goodness me, Tig just dispensed the weakest second serve I’ve ever seen, short, skipping up off the clay, and duly marmalised by Osaka. In commentary, they reckon Sampras had the best second-serve in men’s history – shout from me for Edberg’s kicker – and Durie mentions Barty in the women’s game. Anyhow, Tig survives a break point to hold. Tig 4-6 2-2 It took a while, but Fognini has fought back to take the first set from Barrere, 6-4; Kalinina now leads Kerber – who’s won every major but this one – 6-2 4-0. Tossing those opportunities has not not gone down well with Osaka, who powers through a break to love, seizing the first set and sealing it with a colossal forehand racing forward. Tig 4-6 Osaka Updates from the women’s side: Kozlova 2-6 Tomljanovic, Cocciaretto 1-6 2-3 Bogdan, Collins 6-2 1-1 Wang Have a look! Kalinina breaks Kerber in the first game of the second set and quickly consolidates, while a double fault helps Tig earn a break-back point; Osaka impatiently whips a forehand long, and we’re back on serve! Tig 4-5 Osaka Tig saves three set points, forcing Osaka to serve for the first set, while Badosa has taken hers against Davis, 6-2. When they’re done on court six, Dan Evans will have a go; he plays the Serb, Miomir Kecmanović. Kerber couldn’t do enough, and after a succession of deuces during which she saved a set point with a net cord, Kalinina comes through 6-2. Carreno Busta, the number 12 seed, has rinsed through the first set against Gombos 6-3 and now trails 0-1 in the second, on serve; I’m not quite sure how they’ve managed 10 games so quickly, but they have. By way of comparison, Barrere leads Fognini 3-2, still with the break he took early doors. Osaka isn’t a natural mover on clay but she’s hitting it very nicely indeed, especially with feet planted. She’s won 15 out of 16 on serve, and her second straight love-game leaves her close to the first set. Tig 2-5 Osaka Yeah, time’s up. Kerber has roused herself to claw back a break. It might not save this set for her, but if she maintains her current level, she’ll be reet. Kalinina 5-2 Kerber Out of the corner of my eye, I’m also watching Paula Badosa, the number 33 seed, playing Lauren Davis; Badosa is a Manhattan-born Spaniard and won the girls’ singles in 2015. She’s looking good out there, leading 4-2. Elsewhere, Bogdan has taken the first set against Cocciaretto, 6-1; Fognini is a break down to Barrere; and Tomljanovic leads Kozlova 3-0. It’s all going wrong for Kerber, who now trails Kalinina 5-0. Under an umbrella – what a lovely sight that is – she takes some deep breaths while having a serious word with herself. Yeah, Osaka is grooving, greeting a decent first serve with a belter of a cross-court return to raise break point. But Tig yanks her in and Osaka stutter-slides in to botch a slice of her own ... but no matter. She’s piecing Tig up here, and a booming forehand nails her fourth advantage. Tig 0-2 Osaka I’m also watching Angelique Kerber, who’s not a great clay artist and is 0-2 down to Anhelina Kalinina, the qualifer. Meanwhile, on Chatrier, Jo Durie discusses how brilliant the current standard of women’s tennis is, and she’s right. I suppose I might slightly disagree, she’ll be devo’d to learn, because there’s no dominant champion at the peak of their powers. Perhaps Osaka will be become that, but otherwise there are so many who are so good, and when you stick on a match you’ve not a clue what’s going to happen, and that’s a beautiful thing. I’m really looking forward to seeing the improvements Osaka has made on clay, and she saves a break point in the opening game of the match. Tig 0-1 Osaka. On Chatrier, Naomi Osaka will be underway in une minute. Here’s Tumaini Carayol on her big call. Well, on the show courts - there’s plenty else besides. Chatrier Tig v Osaka [2] Andujar v Thiem [4] Azarenka [15] v Kuznetsova Tsitsipas [5] v Chardy Lenglen Fognini [27] v Barrere Minnen [Q] v Kvitova [11] Konjuh [Q] v Sabalneka [3] Zverev [6] v Otte [Q] Mathieu Burel v Kovinivic Fucsovics v Simon Moutet v Djere Dodin v Keys [23] It’s been an enervating, affirming winter slog, but we made it, and with the first ball tossed this morning, the summer of sport – the ridiculous summer of sport – is upon us. And you can be absolutely certain that we’ll take it. Most importantly, each of the show courts will house up to 1000 fans a day for each of the first 10 days – and hopefully more thereafter. They, like the rest of us, will be wondering whether this, finally, is the year that Rafael Nadal finally runs out of road; Novak Djokovic, Dominic Thiem, Stefanos Tsitsipas and Daniil Medvedev will be hoping so, but it will only be a hope. Meanwhile and as has become the fashion – sorry, le mode – no one has a clue what’ll happen in the women’s side. Iga Swiatek is the defending champion and if she hits a vein she’ll be hard to stop, but there are just so many others who might do likewise that anyone who thinks they know is lying. I cannot wait.

As well as being a dwelling, housing is an asset and the price of housing is more likely to be affected by changes to finance (eg stamp duty, interest rates, lenders’ risk appetite). Evidence suggests that when interest rates are low and debt is cheap, then prices go up. Building more houses just allows those who are financially leveraged to buy them.</p> <p>So, to the question: if a million houses were built, prices would be unlikely to tumble (as some may suggest), but we would add more assets to the pockets of the already wealthy who are able to buy them for rental. But that’s the point, isn’t it? Now, if you were to build a million publicly owned houses … <strong>Hquartermain</strong></p> <p>Hot money from Asia and the Middle East would continue to flow in and buy them as an investment. Thus they would rise. <strong>Lindisfarn</strong></p> <p>The focus of property developers is 100% on making properties as expensive as possible so that they can maximise their profits. Without intervention from responsible government (thus ruling out the UK) this will continue, so house prices are not likely to go down, but there may be more choice. Property developers may also try to get more profit from dodgy tax breaks from ministers, but this will not reduce the market prices either. It looks like we are stuffed. <strong>Bucharesta</strong></p> <p>The way to start controlling the obscene property market is to have real rent controls, with levels set to a point that real people can afford. This will drive down the so-called “value” of buy-to-rent properties and also reduce the massive profits from those greedy enough to want to profit from somebody else’s misery. Lower buy-to-rent prices may also mean a sell-off of some of those properties at a price that is also affordable. <strong>InAsMuch</strong></p> <p>Given that housing in the UK is provided by the private sector, developers will wish to optimise their returns. They achieve that by controlling output to ensure that supply never outstrips demand. Therefore, it could be determined that this question is symptomatic of a misunderstood housing crisis. The government and the housing lobby have created a narrative that supply is the problem. Build, build, build is the mantra.</p> <p>The affordability crisis will not be solved by the government’s policy of leaving the private sector to deliver. Why? Because there is an industry to support the renegotiation of affordable housing commitments and because “affordable” is not actually affordable to those who need it. Housing waiting lists remain stubbornly above 1m while right-to-buy inexorably reduces the stock of social homes.</p> <p>Last year 243,770 new dwellings were built. Of those, only 10% were “affordable”. The public sector stock decreased by 9,000. Furthermore, affordable in this sense means “discounted”, 20% off market rates, and is not affordable to those in greatest need. True affordability is defined by many, including Shelter, as 35% of household income.</p> <p>Shelter hit the nail on the head this week with a renewed call for social homes. Not only would this provide housing for those most in need – it would also bring economic and social benefits, including reducing government’s housing benefits bill. The Community Planning Alliance was founded in April to bring together more than 400 campaign groups across the country that signed up to our grassroots map. <strong>Rosie Pearson, Community Planning Alliance</strong></p> <p>In Cornwall, city dwellers buy up new builds, off-plan, without even viewing them, as a bolthole. Local estate agents cannot keep up with them. Then they leave them empty except for possibly a few weeks holiday a year. These people contribute diddly-squat to the local economy. If they move to the country, they rent out their city home. They are the only winners from new builds.</p> <p>The majority of housebuilding is four-bed detached or semi-detached. It is only out-of-county people who can afford these.

Build more desirable homes and they will be bought up by those with money to spend, demand will keep driving prices up and nothing will improve. It is the Tory way. Another way of getting public money (via housing benefit) into the hands of their voters. Works a treat! <strong>ScienceThink</strong></p> <p>There’s a huge amount of home-building where I live in Edinburgh, but prices continue to rise ever upwards.

Not only that but the properties were being left empty, forcing development further and further from the centre for people who actually needed somewhere to live – with all the negative knock-on effects on transport congestion. They ultimately introduced a foreign-buyer tax and an empty-home tax – both far too late. We would do well to get on and do the same before we allow our cities to be turned into hollow shells. <strong>Natalie Godfrey</strong></p> <p>I seem to remember that there are already enough homes for the UK population, but that the control of the second-home (and “investment” properties, including money launderers) market drives, and keeps ever higher, house prices and rents.</p> <p>We could solve this, as I believe France does, through appropriate taxation (say 95% on capital gains from second homes, a similar amount on rent, Airbnb and the like ... and punitive council taxes on second and empty homes) but that would be democratic socialism.

Renters who want to buy are treated appallingly in the UK. <strong>YorkshireClaret</strong></p> <p>Looking at historical data ... increase a lot!</p> <p>Since 1978, we have built about 7.5m homes in the UK. In 1978 the average house price was £12,500, <a href=\"https://landregistry.data.gov.uk/app/ukhpi/browse?from=1966-01-01&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Flandregistry.data.gov.uk%2Fid%2Fregion%2Funited-kingdom&amp;to=2018-04-01&amp;lang=en\">now it is £225,000</a>. If you account for inflation, the 1978 house would now cost £73,000. So 7.5m homes lead to a x5.8 increase over the period.</p> <p>Of course there are many other factors to consider, such as the performance of the economy, population growth etc but several studies by University College London and the <a href=\"https://www.lse.ac.uk/business-and-consultancy/consulting/consulting-reports/understanding-the-local-impact-of-new-residential-development\">London School of Economics </a>show that building new houses doesn’t actually lower prices even in the immediate vicinity of the development. The only people who benefit from the building of these homes would be the developers and land owners, the reason for this is that too many homes that are built cater only for those already on the property ladder (on average, houses are being built that are larger than the existing stock). The housing crisis isn’t a problem of people outgrowing city-centre flats and wanting a bit more space for the family (whom developers generally cater for on greenfield sites), it is properly affordable homes for people starting out.</p> <p>The only way the government is going to address its levelling- up agenda is by providing more affordable homes, not by making it easier for developers to get permission. What <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-51577853\">developers build and where</a> they build it is entirely down to which options make them the most money; building truly affordable homes in the so-called red-wall areas won’t make as much money as building toy towns on greenfield sites in the more expensive parts of the UK. <strong>Marc Munier</strong></p> <p>As others have said, I don’t think there’s a straightforward answer because there are so many factors involved. However, there are currently about 27m homes in the UK so this would be an increase of only about 4% to the housing stock. There were about 250,000 new homes built in 2019, so a million is a big increase but not an order of magnitude increase. My best guess is therefore that a million isn’t enough to really have an effect on prices. Double that or more and you might start seeing something (depending on locations, sizes, prices etc). <strong>roondoony</strong></p> <p>If built privately for private ownership/rental, it’s hard not to see that this would add to the current spiral of unaffordable housing – who in their right mind thinks they wouldn’t be bought up by landlords and priced in line with current trends? If built as a public endeavour for sale at affordable prices to people who want to “get on to the housing ladder”, then at best you’re putting off the same problem for a couple of decades. And probably making it worse.</p> <p>If built as pool housing for long-term rental, ie “council housing”, you’re barely scratching the surface with a million homes – you have to build lots of housing (more than is needed – oversupply is what reduces demand and thus prices), protect them with laws to ensure they can’t be sold off and are serviced adequately within the public sector, as well as pay developers upfront to cover the high costs of building quality stock they will not be able to sell themselves.</p> <p>Housing is a lot like other infrastructure, such as rail – important enough to be run as a non-profit/loss-leading public enterprise and totally impractical to be trusted to the private sector.

We’ve been doing online yoga without an instructor’s watchful eye and lunging with Joe Wicks without warming up, but mostly slouching over laptops feeling tense or depressed.</p> <p>While the onset of back, shoulder or neck pain can feel like the last straw, the good news is that it probably isn’t as bad as you think. “It’s not likely to be serious,” says Chris Mercer, an NHS consultant physiotherapist in Sussex who specialises in back pain. It was not uncommon to keep an old door under the bed, upon which to lie when your back “went”.

He did, in fact, have something serious – sciatica, intense pain, usually in the back of one leg, caused by the compression or irritation of the sciatic nerve – but is now as fit as a fiddle and believes the exercise regime he developed for himself not only cured his back pain, but helped him avoid surgery.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"05e535c6ec2fc916147baf06dd11196b9a76f333\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/05e535c6ec2fc916147baf06dd11196b9a76f333/0_0_3476_2348/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘I worked really, really hard, and it worked’ ...

An orthopaedic surgeon told Noonan that he had a hardened perineural cyst in his spine, and the only lasting solution was surgery. But to Noonan, it felt “intuitive that if you can, by stretching, raise those collapsed vertebrae a little better, that might solve the problem. So I worked really, really hard. And it worked.”</p> <p>A physiotherapist taught him how to do pelvic tilts – lying flat on your back and lifting the pelvis up off the floor. “It felt really good to learn how to move my pelvis,” he says, “and I became kind of driven about that.” He devised a series of 15 exercises – some from physiotherapists, some from yoga, some he has tweaked himself. He does them when he gets up, and again later in the day, each repeated 15 times, breathing through each one. “I’ve learned from experience that it’s easier to fake your way through 10,” he says. “But you want to be thoughtful and deliberate about every one of them.”</p> <p>Noonan’s regime will not suit everyone but, crucially, he found what worked for him. Mercer’s good news continues, however, because it doesn’t matter what type of exercise you do, as long as you like it and you are sensible. “There is loads of evidence that exercise is good for back pain,” he says. “But none of the research points to one form of exercise being better than another. So the advice is to do something you enjoy because you’ll keep doing it. For me, that would be surfing or a bike ride, but for somebody else that could be doing Zumba, yoga or pilates. The evidence just says you’re better to move and do stuff than not. It’s a lot simpler than people think.”</p> <p>Caroline Atkinson is living proof of such a philosophy. She is 55, 6ft 1in and has always been an athletic, mountain-climbing, sports-playing, distance-swimming kind of woman. In 1999, she had back surgery for disc degeneration, and is an advocate for exercising to manage ongoing back and shoulder problems, as well as an active member of the National Back Pain Association community.</p> <p>“Within six months of the operation,” she says, “I was back in a pool. I’ve continued to have a gym membership. I started doing long-distance bike rides and hikes of 25 to 50 miles in one day.” She wanted to get back into tennis, too, but realised, “You don’t play tennis to get fit. You get fit so you can play the sport you love.” To do that, she started pilates, and continues a “regimental” daily routine. “Whether I’m in a hotel room or a tent or working in an office, I get my mat out and do pilates every morning to remobilise myself. If I didn’t do my stretching in the morning and I didn’t get up throughout the day, I would really suffer.”</p> <p>While an entire industry has sprung up around the notion of special exercises for individual conditions, says Mercer, “the evidence doesn’t stack up behind them”. There has, for example, been great emphasis on improving core strength to support good posture, but even this can be a red herring. “Sometimes it causes people to focus on tightening their abdominals, so everything’s really tight instead of moving normally. You can end up teaching people unhelpful ways of moving,” he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"90c76cb08276bfa2eddf223072ee72a2e856f3f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/90c76cb08276bfa2eddf223072ee72a2e856f3f6/0_310_5740_3443/1000.jpg\" alt=\"woman doing yoga at home\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘It doesn’t matter what type of exercise you do, as long as you like it and you are sensible.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Posed by model/Silke Woweries/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To put it in perspective, he suggests you think of back pain like a sprained ankle. “The tissues in your back that can cause irritation with the discs and nerves and joints are like tissues in the rest of the body and they react in the same way,” he says. “A sprained ankle might be a bit sore to walk on but you can hobble around a little, while it gets better slowly.” So the message is, essentially, don’t freak out? “That should be the headline of your article. Perfect advice,” he says.</p> <p>If it hurts too much to carry out your usual tasks and activities, the NHS recommends taking over-the-counter painkillers and remaining “active within the limits of your pain”, says Mercer. If pottering around and changing sitting position regularly is all that is possible for a while, then at least do that. “What can happen if people have had a severe episode of pain is that they stop walking, gardening, going for a bike ride and doing all the things that they like to do. They become less and less active, and more and more disabled by their worries.”</p> <p>If, after a few weeks, there’s no improvement, he suggests talking to your GP about some stronger anti-inflammatory tablets. Then, if it still hasn’t settled down after a few more weeks of being as active as possible, this is when, he says, “seeing a healthcare professional is probably helpful. They can see how you are doing the exercise and might be able to advise you on how to pace it, and how to adapt so that you can still do it without causing pain.”</p> <p>Victoria Tzortziou Brown, the joint honorary secretary of the Royal College of General Practitioners, agrees that exercise, “perhaps counterintuitively”, is the best treatment, such as “walking, swimming or safe stretching exercises. Back pain episodes can be disabling and worrying but they are common and usually people recover reasonably quickly. If, however, the pain persists or is severe, patients are advised to discuss their symptoms with their GP.” More serious conditions, such as a slipped disc or sciatica, usually cause extra symptoms such as <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/back-pain/\">numbness, weakness or a tingling sensation</a>, and would need to be investigated by your doctor. “If you are developing clear weakness in your legs you should also seek advice,” says Mercer. Very rarely, he adds, the nerves in the spine that connect the bladder, bowels and sexual organs, and provide sensation around the genitals and back passage can be compressed. “If you develop any changes in these functions, you should seek immediate advice.”</p> <p>Exercise is about more than physical fitness. “Back pain is heavily linked to depression and mental health problems,” says Mercer. And exercise is, of course, brilliant for helping to maintain mental health. So while Noonan’s exercises have improved his strength and balance, they have also boosted his confidence. “I think I’ve become more open to the world around me,” he says. “And I’ve certainly become more open to how my body works.”</p> <p>Yoga has long been associated with improved mental health as well as improving back pain symptoms. In 2011, Alison Trewhela, a yoga teacher who specialises in classes for people with back pain, was approached by researchers at the University of York to collaborate on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/oct/31/yoga-lower-back-pain-treatments\">a study</a>, funded by Arthritis Research UK, to test yoga’s efficacy in relieving symptoms.

By last October, more than a third of people in the UK had reported increased back pain, according to one study – and that was before an intense winter lockdown, followed by a month-long storm. We’ve been doing online yoga without an instructor’s watchful eye and lunging with Joe Wicks without warming up, but mostly slouching over laptops feeling tense or depressed. While the onset of back, shoulder or neck pain can feel like the last straw, the good news is that it probably isn’t as bad as you think. “It’s not likely to be serious,” says Chris Mercer, an NHS consultant physiotherapist in Sussex who specialises in back pain. It was not uncommon to keep an old door under the bed, upon which to lie when your back “went”. But the latest evidence indicates that being active is essential for both avoidance and recovery. “Keep moving, keep active and things will settle,” he says.

Out it fizzed, and Adam Lyth guided the ball off his hip and into the waiting hands of Luke Wells at leg slip. The first “Oh Lanky Lanky” since 2019 trilled over Old Trafford as Lyth stalked towards the dressing room.</p> <p>Seven overs later, the penultimate of the day, Saqib Mahmood hurtled in off his long, long run and pinned Tom Kohler-Cadmore in front of the stumps. Mahmood punched the air while Kohler-Cadmore slumped back off, followed shortly afterwards by a clatter that sounded very much like a bat being thumped repeatedly against a wall.</p> <p>Their frustration was understandable: Kohler-Cadmore and Lyth had batted for 38 of the 47 overs <strong>Yorkshire </strong>had to survive in the day, risking sending the masses into a stupor with their dedication and application to the task at hand: batting for the rest of Saturday and the whole of Sunday. They so nearly did it.</p> <p>It was Josh Bohannon, with the help of Danny Lamb, who had set Lancashire up for the kill, moving to the second Championship century of his career and his first Roses hundred slow-quick-slow – which was just what was needed. Wickets came as Lancashire upped the ante before the declaration, but by then the lead was 350.</p> <p>Yorkshire’s woes won’t have been helped by <strong>Northamptonshire</strong>’s progress down at Hove. With a win in touching distance, they will leapfrog Yorkshire to second place in Division Two. Despite a game second innings by <strong>Sussex</strong>, which included a hundred by Tom Haines and 95 for Ben Brown as well as five wickets for Simon Kerrigan, Northants were set just 218 to win. By stumps, they needed only 87 more with eight wickets in hand.</p> <p><strong>Essex</strong> beat <strong>Durham</strong> by 195 runs in an lbw-fest at The Riverside after Peter Siddle and Jamie Porter made mincemeat of their middle and late order. Durham lost five for 38 as the sun slipped down the sky, Alex Lees working hard for his 48. When Jack Burnham became the 19th player to be given out lbw, it was a record in an English first-class match.</p> <p>Daniel Moriarty took his fourth five-wicket haul of his short first-class career, bowling <strong>Gloucestershire</strong> into a hole at The Oval. The <strong>Surrey</strong> bowler took six for 60, and Amar Virdi three for 46, in the first innings, as Gloucestershire were bundled out for 158, with only Miles Hammond in a four-hour 77 providing any bulk to the batting.</p> <p>Following on, meanwhile, Hammond found himself at the crease sooner than he might have hoped and was unbeaten again on 38 at the close, but Gloucester are still 191 behind with just five wickets left.</p> <p>Career-best bowling from Dillon Pennington gave <strong>Worcestershire</strong> the upper hand at New Road. Pennington snaffled four for 44 in the first innings then three for 25 in the next as <strong>Derbyshire</strong> were invited to follow on and crumbled.</p> <p><strong>Leicestershire</strong> need an unlikely 303 to win against <strong>Middlesex</strong> on a turning pitch. Chris Wright had whistled through Middlesex earlier with six for 48.</p> <p>An intriguing final last day lies in wait at Edgbaston as <strong>Warwickshire</strong> and <strong>Nottinghamshire </strong>went nose to nose. Fifties for Michael Burgess and Will Rhodes inched Warwickshire to a lead of 245 by stumps.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60b348698f088d8c3178d773\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-05-30T09:22:53.974Z\">10.22am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>A most beautiful May morning, </strong>the sky milky-eyed blue, the air full of blossom and Paul Allot in his shorts.

My spider senses are a-tingling. Notts 57-3, wickets for Bresnan, Norwell and Briggs. Tom Bailey takes the new ball and - hey presto - three balls later Lewis Hill’s off stump takes a turn for the worse. Worse yet, Saqib Mahmood takes over from Parkinson at the James Anderson end. Yorkshire 152-5. Surrey 473 beat Gloucestershire 158 and 268 Tattersall left high and dry on 86! Moriarty takes his second wicket of the innings, and eighth of the match. Virdi finishes with six in the match. Gloucestershire lose their unbeaten record and Surrey win the second game! Gloucestershire remain top of Group 2 with 107, Somerset on their tails 104, Surrey third 101 (but having played one extra game).

That’s lunch! Fabulous bowling by Mahmood but well batted Yorkies. Lancashire are just three overs away from taking the new ball. Some thoughts around that the press box that the ball might not be spinning as much because the pitch is so abrasive that the ball has gone soft. Or maybe it’s the weather. Or maybe something quite else. To be honest, it is all still a mystery. The Yorkshire Post points out that Tattersall was dropped by Yorkshire for not scoring enough runs... Oh bother, Hass is out for two. Notts 16-1. One last fizz for Parkinson before lunch here at OT, four men close enough to examine Hill’s ear. Virdi has taken one more at The Oval, Tattersall STILL there, 69 not out, but Gloucestershire on the crumble of the cliff. And well done Leicestershire! Harris and Ackermann still there, 157-2. Ah! While I was gazing at the summer fixtures and pondering July, Warwickshire were all out. Notts set 309 to win with England-bound Haseeb Hameed at the crease. Currently 6-0. In days of yore (April) I’d have said Notts had not a chance, but now.... they’ll do it by tea! Four wickets for Fletcher; Burgess 80, Briggs 50. A bowling change at Old Trafford, where the Yorkies had started to look unseasonably comfortable. Liam Livingstone replaces Parkinson after a brief but fruitless flurry from the BS end; and Luke Wood replaces Danny Lamb at the JA end. At The Oval, Amar Virdi snags his third wicket, Matt Taylor for 12. Jonny Tattersall holding out for his adopted team, 51 not out. Northants 256 and 218-7 beat Sussex 175 and 298 This makes it very tasty! More runs for Saif Zaib, 47; Rob Keogh, 60. Northants confirmed in third place in Group 3 with 97 points. Northants trilling merrily on their way - just 19 needed now; while Warwickshire bat on - 250-7 - a lead of 294. Bat on till 2.30 before the declaration? Worcestershire 421 beat Derbyshire 270 and 128 by an innings and 23 runs. Pennington finishes with five - and nine in the match. Only three batsmen in double figures for Derbyshire in a sorry second innings. Just the ticket. Parky replaces Tom Bailey at the Brian Statham End. Meanwhile, Gloucestershire are crumbling, losing their glue, Hammond, to Moriarty for 45 before Smith bowled by Joverton for one. At 148-7, they need 167 to make Surrey bat again. A forlorn hope. Should they lose, Lancashire will be the only team in the Championship with an unbeaten record. The off stump The middle stump... Another for Mahmood! This time it moves away, away and ping the off stump flies! Beautifull. Yorkshire 92-4. A beauty from Saqib Mahmood! A fast inswinger that plucks Fraine’s middle stump and sends it flying. Fraine turns his bat the wrong way round and plods off, the second time in the match he’s had an unplayable ball from Mahmood. Yorkshire 87-3. That man Pennington again! Fourth of the innings, eighth of the match. Derbyshire 188-8, still 33 behind Leicestershire lose their first wicket of the day and it is Sam Evans, who gives John Simpsom some catching practise. Tom Helm pockets his first of the innings and Leics are 85-2. A wicket too soon. A fizzing opening ball from Mahmood which Fraine leaves with an eye-brow raising boldness. The players are out, Patterson pressing forward, forward, forward with his bat as he walks. Mahmood has the ball from the James Anderson end. It has just been pointed out to me that Northants will NOT leap on top of Yorkshire if they win... apologies. If Yorks lose today they will have 99 points; and if Northants win they will have 97. We know Jimmy Anderson would have preferred to take his 1000th wicket at the Roses match, but needs must. Vic over a morning coffee: heaven. Group One Riverside: ESSEX 182 and 301 BEAT DURHAM 99 and 189 by 195 runs Edgbaston: Warwickshire 341 all out and 201-6 v Nottinghamshire 297 New Road: Worcestershire 421 all out v Derbyshire 270 and 112-6 Group Two Grace Road: Leicestershire 136 and 75-1 Middlesex 295 and 218 all out Leicestershire need 303 to win The Oval: Surrey 473 all out v Gloucestershire 158 and 124-5 Group Three Old Trafford: Lancashire 509-9dec v Yorkshire 159 and 85-2 Hove: Sussex 175 and 298 v Northants 256 and 131-2 Northants need 87 to win His shadow lolling out to the right, a white flannel tucked into the waistband of his trousers and his cropped hair gleaming in the sun, Lancashire’s Matt Parkinson ripped a ball into the rough. Out it fizzed, and Adam Lyth guided the ball off his hip and into the waiting hands of Luke Wells at leg slip. The first “Oh Lanky Lanky” since 2019 trilled over Old Trafford as Lyth stalked towards the dressing room. Seven overs later, the penultimate of the day, Saqib Mahmood hurtled in off his long, long run and pinned Tom Kohler-Cadmore in front of the stumps. Mahmood punched the air while Kohler-Cadmore slumped back off, followed shortly afterwards by a clatter that sounded very much like a bat being thumped repeatedly against a wall. Their frustration was understandable: Kohler-Cadmore and Lyth had batted for 38 of the 47 overs Yorkshire had to survive in the day, risking sending the masses into a stupor with their dedication and application to the task at hand: batting for the rest of Saturday and the whole of Sunday. They so nearly did it. It was Josh Bohannon, with the help of Danny Lamb, who had set Lancashire up for the kill, moving to the second Championship century of his career and his first Roses hundred slow-quick-slow – which was just what was needed. Wickets came as Lancashire upped the ante before the declaration, but by then the lead was 350. Yorkshire’s woes won’t have been helped by Northamptonshire’s progress down at Hove. With a win in touching distance, they will leapfrog Yorkshire to second place in Division Two. Despite a game second innings by Sussex, which included a hundred by Tom Haines and 95 for Ben Brown as well as five wickets for Simon Kerrigan, Northants were set just 218 to win. By stumps, they needed only 87 more with eight wickets in hand. Essex beat Durham by 195 runs in an lbw-fest at The Riverside after Peter Siddle and Jamie Porter made mincemeat of their middle and late order. Durham lost five for 38 as the sun slipped down the sky, Alex Lees working hard for his 48. When Jack Burnham became the 19th player to be given out lbw, it was a record in an English first-class match. Daniel Moriarty took his fourth five-wicket haul of his short first-class career, bowling Gloucestershire into a hole at The Oval. The Surrey bowler took six for 60, and Amar Virdi three for 46, in the first innings, as Gloucestershire were bundled out for 158, with only Miles Hammond in a four-hour 77 providing any bulk to the batting. Following on, meanwhile, Hammond found himself at the crease sooner than he might have hoped and was unbeaten again on 38 at the close, but Gloucester are still 191 behind with just five wickets left. Career-best bowling from Dillon Pennington gave Worcestershire the upper hand at New Road. Pennington snaffled four for 44 in the first innings then three for 25 in the next as Derbyshire were invited to follow on and crumbled. Leicestershire need an unlikely 303 to win against Middlesex on a turning pitch. Chris Wright had whistled through Middlesex earlier with six for 48. An intriguing final last day lies in wait at Edgbaston as Warwickshire and Nottinghamshire went nose to nose. Fifties for Michael Burgess and Will Rhodes inched Warwickshire to a lead of 245 by stumps. A most beautiful May morning, the sky milky-eyed blue, the air full of blossom and Paul Allot in his shorts. Here at Old Trafford, a thriller awaits as Yorkshire attempt to bat out the day and Lancashire, with Parky whirling and Mahmood charging, press for the kill. Elsewhere, Northants should knock off the runs this morning; Leicester have to defy the might of Middlesex; at The Oval Miles Hammond lies between Surrey and victory; Worcestershire are on course to roll-over Derbyshire and a close match awaits at Edgbaston.","charCount":"9374","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/tanyaaldred\">Tanya Aldred</a> at Old Trafford"},{"headline":"Covid live news: UK considering compulsory vaccination for NHS staff; Malaysia to increase immunisation efforts ","standfirst":"<p>Latest updates: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2021/may/30/covid-live-news-uk-lockdown-ending-date-keir-starmer-boris-johnson-australia-new-zealand-india-variant-coronavirus?page=with:block-60b34a0e8f08d486a771760b#block-60b34a0e8f08d486a771760b\">UK government considering mandatory jabs for health workers</a>; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2021/may/30/covid-live-news-uk-lockdown-ending-date-keir-starmer-boris-johnson-australia-new-zealand-india-variant-coronavirus?page=with:block-60b342668f086d71cc15efd6#block-60b342668f086d71cc15efd6\">Malaysia to set up more mega vaccination centres</a></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/may/29/keir-starmer-boris-johnsons-chaos-could-hit-june-plan-to-lift-lockdown\">Keir Starmer: Boris Johnson’s chaos could hit June plan to lift lockdown</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul>","trailText":"Latest updates: UK government considering mandatory jabs for health workers; Malaysia to set up more mega vaccination centres","byline":"Caroline Davies and Maya Wolfe-Robinson","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"237a4ea09ddf9a90716c55143bcae6a72f4b5f8f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/237a4ea09ddf9a90716c55143bcae6a72f4b5f8f/0_360_5399_3239/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People sitting outside drinking and eating al fresco in Margate, Kent.

You can get in touch on caroline.davies@theguardian.com.</p> <p>In the<strong> UK,</strong> there are calls for a more informed debate on the planned lifting of all legal limits on social contact in <strong>England </strong>on June 21 as Labour questioned if the move would proceed. The continued spread of the Indian coronavirus variant has prompted experts to argue restrictions should remain in place until more people have received both doses of a vaccine amid reports ministers are drawing up plans for a partial end of lockdown. NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson said a “much better quality of debate” was needed on the implications of easing measures, according to the BBC. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/may/29/we-faced-an-unprecedented-crisis-but-tens-of-thousands-of-second-wave-covid-deaths-were-avoidable-and-unforgivable\">Writing in The Observer, opposition leader Sir Keir Starmer </a>said “weak, slow decisions” by the Government on border policy had allowed the Indian variant to spread.</p> <p>Meanwhile, leaders of Australia and New Zealand have had their first face-to-face meeting since the coronavirus outbreak prompted both countries to close their borders. Australian prime minister Scott Morrison arrived in the tourist resort of Queenstown for an overnight visit on Sunday. He greeted his New Zealand counterpart Jacinda Ardern with a traditional Maori hongi, in which the pair pressed noses together. Morrison is the first major world leader to visit New Zealand since both countries shut their borders last year to contain the virus. The neighbours opened a quarantine-free travel bubble last month, although a recent outbreak of the virus in Melbourne has prompted New Zealand to suspend the arrangement with Victoria state.</p> </div>   </div>","wordcount":"3300","firstPublicationDate":"2021-05-30T07:22:38Z","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2021-05-30T12:59:31Z","liveBloggingNow":"true","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/p/htndp","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/237a4ea09ddf9a90716c55143bcae6a72f4b5f8f/0_360_5399_3239/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","isLive":"true","bodyText":"Kenya has extended its nightly curfew by 60 days to slow the spread of Covid-19, the interior ministry said, according to the Reuters news agency. The move followed a decision by President Uhuru Kenyatta in late March to extend the 10pm to 4am curfew. A ban on political gatherings and processions that could turn into super spreader events was also extended for 60 days, as was a prohibition on overnight events and vigils, the ministry said. When the first coronavirus cases were confirmed in Kenya in March 2020, the government closed schools, imposed a curfew, banned public gatherings and on multiple occasions restricted movement in and out of the most-affected regions. Some restrictions, such as on schools, were eventually relaxed. The ban on public gatherings and processions and overnight meetings will stay in force, the ministry said. Kenya has recorded 170,485 cases and 3,141 deaths, Ministry of Health data showed on Saturday, with a positivity rate of 8.9%. Covid-19 vaccinations began on March 5 and so far 968,733 people have received their first dose. Boris Johnson faces a difficult decision about whether to end England’s lockdown on June 21 with hospitals already under “worrying” pressure, a health chief has warned. According to the Press Association news agency, NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson said hospital bosses were concerned about the transmissibility of the B1617.2 variant and the large number of people who have still to receive doses of the vaccine. He warned that although hospitals were not expecting to be overwhelmed by a surge of Covid-19 cases, they were already stretched by going “full pelt” on dealing with the backlog of cases built up during the pandemic and urgent care needs. Hopson said: Significant numbers of Covid-19 hospital inpatients will adversely impact care backlog recovery, (the) current degree of pressure on hospitals is worrying especially since we saw clear summer demand surges in the two years before Covid-19. But if, as evidence above suggests, success of (the) vaccination campaign means much lower levels of hospitalisation, serious illness and mortality, even with (the) new variant, that is very significant and important. This means there is a difficult decision to make for June 21. He also suggested the government needs to consider the increased burden on hospitals in UK holiday hotspots in coming months with people not travelling abroad, saying one trust chief on the south coast had warned they will “struggle” to meet the “significant extra demand”. Dr Mike Tildesley, a member of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (Spi-M) Government advisory panel, said there was still “quite a lot of uncertainty” around the June 21 date. He told LBC radio scientists had “an awful lot of work to do” to analyse data on the link between cases and hospital admissions, while bearing in mind the situation with the Indian variant, to give evidence to the government. South Korea will get 1m doses of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s vaccine this week mainly to inoculate military personnel, after the United States almost doubled a pledge made earlier this month, prime minister Kim Boo-kyum said on Sunday. South Korea has reported a lower death toll than many comparable developed countries from Covid-19, but the government has come under criticism for a comparatively slow rollout of vaccines, Reuters reports. Less than 11% of its 52 million people have so far received a first dose. US President Joe Biden, at his first summit with President Moon Jae-in earlier this month, promised to supply 550,000 shots for South Korean troops. Kim said that offer had now been increased to 1m doses, and the shots will arrive this week. On care homes, UK vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi today defended the government approach. Boris Johnson’s former aide Dominic Cummings claimed the health secretary, Matt Hancock, had lied to the prime minister over tests being carried out on those discharged into care homes – a charge denied by Hancock. Zahawi said the government had made the best use of the limited testing capacity available when the pandemic struck and it had put a “protective ring” around care homes. Asked whether Hancock had promised care home residents would be tested before discharge from hospital, Zahawi told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: Matt Hancock was very much focused on delivery, I think it’s worth putting this in context … in the sense that in the eye of the storm, we were only able to do 2,000 tests a day. The diagnostics industry was almost non-existent in the UK. He added Hancock had said that “people going into care homes absolutely should be tested and the system, the NHS, operationalised that” as testing capacity increased. Asked why people had been sent home without tests, Zahawi said “hindsight is a wonderful thing”, adding: We can sit here and sort of argue the toss about asymptomatic transmission … and when we really knew about that. The whole point is you use every resource available to you, to the best of your ability, to save and to protect as many people as possible. There have been more than 36,275 deaths involving Covid-19 in care homes since the pandemic began. Zahawi said: When the inquiry is held, and we will look at all these things in detail, we will of course examine where we could do better. But to say that we didn’t deal with them to the best of our capability, with the resources that were available to us, is a mistake, is wrong. Italy has extended an entry ban for people coming from India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, as a continued precaution against the more transmissible Indian variant. The ban, which does not apply to Italian citizens, was introduced in late April and was due to expire on Sunday. It was prolonged until 21 June, a spokesman for Italian health minister Roberto Speranza said in a statement. Care homes were “forgotten” during the “dreadful” early stages of the Covid pandemic in the UK, a sector leader has said. Mike Padgham, the chairman of the Independent Care Group, which represents providers in York and North Yorkshire, told Sky News it had been a “frightening” time for staff and residents. Padgham was questioned in relation to the claim made by former Downing Street adviser Dominic Cummings to MPs this week that suggestions care homes were shielded were “complete nonsense”. Padgham said: I don’t believe myself there was a ring of protection thrown round us. In those very early days it was difficult. We were forgotten. We’ve been forgotten over decades. That’s the only issue in social care. We weren’t prepared. We weren’t ready. We didn’t have the PPE, we didn’t have the testing. And it took the government many, many weeks to actually see what was happening in homes, despite our best efforts and protestations. That is why providers … without their efforts, the figures … would have been much worse.” Vietnam’s business hub Ho Chi Minh City will begin social distancing measures in the city for 15 days starting from Monday in an effort to curb the spread of the coronavirus, according to the state-run Tuoi Tre newspaper reported on Sunday. “All events that gather more than 10 people in public are banned city-wide, but the city is considering to lower the number of people to just five,” the newspaper reported. “While all citizens of Go Vap district are not allowed to go out if not necessary,” the report added. Ho Chi Minh City earlier this week shut down shops and restaurants. A leading scientist has called for stallholders at the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan to be interviewed in any further investigation of the Covid-19 epidemic. Dr Eddie Holmes has joined a growing chorus of voices calling for further investigation into the source of the pandemic. The US president, Joe Biden, has ordered the US intelligence community to intensify its efforts to study the origins of coronavirus, as the theory that the virus might have come from a lab in Wuhan gains traction. He revealed that two of the 18 intelligence agencies are leaning towards the animal link and one leans more toward the lab theory. It is still thought by many that the market in Wuhan is at the centre of the Covid-19 breakout and that the virus jumped from an animal species to humans. On 31 January 2021, a team of scientists led by the World Health Organization visited the market. However, according to their report only two stall operators were interviewed, and neither was engaged in trading wildlife. Edward Holmes, an expert in the evolution and emergence of infectious diseases at the University of Sydney, who saw live wildlife being traded at the Huanan market in 2014, said: “As wildlife present the greatest risk, this should have been the priority in the WHO’s investigation of the market. “However, I’m not sure who controlled the WHO’s schedule so it may have been out of their hands,” he added. “At the very least these stallholders need to be reinterviewed in any additional investigation into the virus origins.” Taiwan reported 355 domestic Covid-19 cases on Sunday. After recording just a handful of daily infections for months, Taiwan is dealing with relatively large numbers of community transmissions, though infection rates are starting to fall. It has only vaccinated around 1% of its more than 23 million people but has almost 30 million shots on order, from AstraZeneca Plc, Moderna Inc and two domestic firms. The UK government is waiting for the latest data on June 14 before deciding whether to proceed with easing the lockdown on June 21, vaccine minister Nadhim Zahawi said. Asked whether that step could be taken if cases were still increasing, he told BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show: What I’m saying to you is we have to be cautious. We have to look at the data and share it with the country. Are we still vaccinating at scale? Big tick. Are the vaccines working? Yes. But are infection rates too high for us to then not be able to proceed because there are too many people getting into hospital? I don’t know the answer to it. But we will know it on, hopefully on the 14th, a few more weeks. He said that as the virus becomes endemic “we’re going to have to live with a certain amount of Covid being transmitted”. On the possible compulsory vaccination of NHS staff in the UK, the shadow cabinet minister Thangam Debbonaire said “threatening” NHS staff to have the vaccine was not a good idea. The shadow Commons leader told Sky News: Given we have got a recruitment crisis in parts of the NHS I think it’s far more important we try and work with staff rather than against them. Threatening staff, I don’t think is a good idea.” Public Health England and the NHS had been successful when they had worked with people to address their doubts and answer questions about the jab, she said. I would like to see the government work with the NHS and social care staff. More on the question of vaccinating children, one expert has said that the emergence of new variants could influence the decision in the UK. Prof Peter Openshaw, a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), told Times Radio that there were “debates” about the possible risks of “very, very rare complications” associated with vaccination, which had to be balanced against the “certainty” that someone can get “very severe complications” by catching Covid. Speaking in a personal capacity, he added: It may well be that actually giving children vaccines will become a clearer option once we know more about the disease in children and whether the new variants are spreading further into the paediatric population and causing more significant disease. That could certainly change the risk-benefit ratio.” Prof Openshaw said the UK placed an emphasis on “public health benefits” and therefore “vaccinating those who may be transmitting disease, sometimes unknowingly, is a perfectly good justification for vaccination”. He added: The new variants extending further down the age range and being of quite high prevalence even in children as young as four, it may be that actually children and school children are going to be a more important part of the transmission chain as the virus becomes more transmissible as new variants arise. So... the benefits might change and that might affect the decision about whether to vaccinate children in the future. British regulators were still considering whether to offer jabs to children, UK vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi told Sky News: Our own regulator has not yet approved giving vaccines to children. You have to make sure the vaccines are incredibly safe before you give them to children. The Pfizer jab has been approved for use in 12-year-olds by regulators in the European Union, US and Canada and Zahawi said the “infrastructure” was in place to jab children in the UK if required. But he said the issue was complicated because the main benefits of the jab were not necessarily felt by children themselves but instead by those around them. He said: On the whole you are vaccinating to protect their families and their communities and the country. UK vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi confirmed the government was considering whether coronavirus jabs should be compulsory for NHS staff. He told Sky News: It’s absolutely the right thing and it would be incumbent on any responsible government to have the debate, to do the thinking as to how we go about protecting the most vulnerable by making sure that those who look after them are vaccinated. There is precedent for this, obviously surgeons get vaccinated for hepatitis B, so it’s something that we are absolutely thinking about. He also said that the World Health Organisation investigation must be able to fully investigate the origins of the pandemic. The Sunday Times reported that British agents believe it is “feasible” that the crisis began with a coronavirus leak from a Chinese research laboratory in Wuhan. Asked about the report, Zahawi said: I think it’s really important that the WHO is allowed to conduct its investigation unencumbered into the origins of this pandemic and that we should leave no stone unturned to understand why – not only because of the current pandemic that has swept the world but also for future-proofing the world’s capability to deal with pandemics. Russia reported 9,694 new cases on Sunday, the highest number since the end of March, which took the national tally to 5,063,442 infections. The Russian coronavirus taskforce said that 355 more deaths of Covid-19 patients were confirmed in the past 24 hours, bringing the official death toll to 121,162. The federal statistics agency has kept a separate count and has said Russia recorded around 250,000 deaths related to Covid-19 from April 2020 to March 2021, Reuters reports. The British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) chief executive Emma McClarkin has called on the UK government to provide advance notice to businesses if restrictions are to remain after June 21. McClarkin acknowledged the government was in a “difficult situation” but said Whitehall had to “stick to its road map”. She told BBC Breakfast: We need the Government to stick to its road map of removing those restrictions by the 21st of June if we want to see the great British pub really begin its recovery. What I need to say is June 21 is absolutely critical to the recovery of the sector. Recovery day only starts when the restrictions are removed. If the Government does leave any lingering restrictions in play then they really need to give us advance notice of that and it needs to talk seriously about financial compensation. But right now we are asking the Government to stick to their road map. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 3,852 to 3,679,148, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Sunday. The reported death toll rose by 56 to 88,406, the tally showed. Malaysia is planning to set up more mega vaccination centres and get private doctors to join immunisation efforts, after five consecutive days of record daily coronavirus infections, Reuters reports. Science minister Khairy Jamaluddin told a virtual news briefing on Sunday that the government will set up another five mega vaccination centres around the capital, Kuala Lumpur, and are considering two in the northen state of Penang and in the southern state of Johor. Nearly 6% of the country’s 32 million people have been vaccinated, according to the website of the governmental Special Committee for Ensuring Access to COVID-19 Vaccine Supply. Khairy said the government is also looking to allow drive-through vaccination centres in the country, after guidelines are firmed up. Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin on Friday announced a nationwide total lockdown from June 1-14 in an effort to curb the spread of the virus. Malaysia reported 6,999 new cases on Sunday, bringing the total infections in the country to 565,533. More than half of people in their 30s in England have received a coronavirus vaccination in a period of little over two weeks, new figures reveal. NHS England said that, since it began opening up the vaccine rollout to this age group on May 13, 53% of those aged 30 to 39 have been given at least one dose. The data comes as Prof Stephen Reicher, a psychologist on the Sage sub-committee advising ministers on behavioural science, said the government was in a “pickle” because it appeared to have abandoned the “data not dates” principle. The NHS, meanwhile, is asking people aged 50 and older, as well as those who are clinically vulnerable, to bring forward their second Covid-19 vaccination to help combat the spread of the B1.617.2 variant first identified in India. It follows the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) recommending earlier this month that the second dose interval be shortened from 12 weeks to eight for people in priority cohorts. India today reported its lowest daily rise in new coronavirus infections in 46 days at 165,553 cases during the previous 24 hours, while deaths rose by 3,460. The south Asian nation’s tally of infections now stands at 27.9m, with a death toll of 325,972, health ministry data showed on Sunday. Good morning, and welcome to the coronavirus global blog. Caroline Davies here, taking you through key developments today. You can get in touch on caroline.davies@theguardian.com. In the UK, there are calls for a more informed debate on the planned lifting of all legal limits on social contact in England on June 21 as Labour questioned if the move would proceed. The continued spread of the Indian coronavirus variant has prompted experts to argue restrictions should remain in place until more people have received both doses of a vaccine amid reports ministers are drawing up plans for a partial end of lockdown. NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson said a “much better quality of debate” was needed on the implications of easing measures, according to the BBC. Writing in The Observer, opposition leader Sir Keir Starmer said “weak, slow decisions” by the Government on border policy had allowed the Indian variant to spread. Meanwhile, leaders of Australia and New Zealand have had their first face-to-face meeting since the coronavirus outbreak prompted both countries to close their borders. Australian prime minister Scott Morrison arrived in the tourist resort of Queenstown for an overnight visit on Sunday. He greeted his New Zealand counterpart Jacinda Ardern with a traditional Maori hongi, in which the pair pressed noses together. Morrison is the first major world leader to visit New Zealand since both countries shut their borders last year to contain the virus. The neighbours opened a quarantine-free travel bubble last month, although a recent outbreak of the virus in Melbourne has prompted New Zealand to suspend the arrangement with Victoria state.","charCount":"19868","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/carolinedavies\">Caroline Davies</a> and <a href=\"profile/maya-wolfe-robinson\">Maya Wolfe-Robinson</a>"},{"headline":"Stetson pulls hats from Nashville shop selling Star of David anti-vaccine badges","standfirst":"<p>Owner of HatWRKS appeared to apologize Saturday as protesters outside the store held signs including ‘no Nazis in Nashville’</p>","trailText":"Owner of HatWRKS appeared to apologize Saturday as protesters outside the store held signs including ‘no Nazis in Nashville’","byline":"Martin Pengelly","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"54bde4a8c243c611c7561767dd6255b770c90aee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/54bde4a8c243c611c7561767dd6255b770c90aee/105_363_4395_2637/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters outside hatWRKS in Nashville, Tennessee, on Saturday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters outside hatWRKS in Nashville, Tennessee, on Saturday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laura Thompson/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Stetson has said it will stop selling its products through a hat store in Nashville, Tennessee which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/29/tennessee-hat-shop-not-vaccinated-badges-star-of-david\">advertised</a> anti-vaccination patches in the style of a Star of David, the badge which Jewish people were made to wear by the Nazis.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/29/idaho-governor-lieutenant-mask-mandate-ban-little-mcgeachin\">‘Tyranny’: Idaho governor repeals lieutenant’s mask mandate ban</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The owner of the shop appeared to apologise on Saturday but a <a href=\"https://stetson.com/\">Stetson</a> company statement <a href=\"https://twitter.com/StetsonUSA/status/1398635159444852743\">said</a>: “We are aware of the situation in Nashville.</p> <p>“We take this matter seriously and are investigating in order to take the necessary and appropriate next steps.

The couple are instead expected to take time off and celebrate their marriage with a larger group of family and friends next summer, after a surprise ceremony in Westminster Cathedral and a low-key Downing Street garden reception. In the first picture released of the newlyweds on Sunday, Johnson was seen in a suit and bright blue tie with a white rose on his lapel, with Symonds, who wore a white embroidered dress and headband of flowers. It is understood she will take his last name and be known as Carrie Johnson. They got engaged on the island of Mustique in late 2019 and had a son, Wilfred, in April 2020 – just weeks after Johnson left hospital after being treated for Covid in intensive care. Plans to tie the knot were put on hold during the pandemic, with the wedding industry one of the hardest hit by curbs on the number of people allowed to socialise and restrictions other aspects such as singing and dancing. It was reported earlier this week in The Sun that Johnson and Symonds had sent save-the-date invites to “celebrate their wedding” on Saturday 30 July 2022, fuelling speculation they would wait until next year. But reports surfaced on Saturday evening that they had been married earlier that day at the Roman Catholic cathedral just over a mile from their home. Shortly after 1.30pm, the cathedral was apparently cleared of visitors, with staff saying it was going into lockdown, followed by the bride arriving half an hour later in a limousine, sweeping into the piazza outside the main west door. Johnson’s father, Stanley, had earlier been spotted in smart attire on the steps of No 10, while a band was also seen exiting Downing Street that evening. The ceremony was reportedly carried out by Father Daniel Humphreys, who had given the couple pre-marriage instructions and baptised Wilfred last year, and makes Johnson the first prime minister to marry in office since Lord Liverpool wedded Mary Chester in 1822. The timing of the ceremony has prompted questions about whether the final set of Covid restrictions – scheduled to be lifted in England on 21 June – could be delayed amid concerns from scientists about cases rising to levels last seen at the end of March and the spread of the variant discovered in India. The vaccines minister, Nadhim Zahawi, insisted the wedding did not take place on Saturday because of the possibility that a cap on guest numbers due to be lifted next month will not happen as planned. Asked if that was the case, he told Sky News’ Trevor Phillips on Sunday: “No – but I want to congratulate the prime minister and Carrie Symonds on tying the knot.” He added it was a “wonderful thing for both of them” and stressed no decisions had been taken about further unlocking, urging people to wait for the official announcement on 14 June.

The happy news for Boris and Carrie Johnson came at the end of a difficult week for the prime minister, when his former chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, claimed he was “distracted” from dealing with the pandemic by “finalising his divorce, his girlfriend wanted to announce being pregnant and an engagement, and his finances”. The Labour MP and former frontbencher Jon Trickett said the wedding was “a good way to bury this week’s bad news” about Cummings’ damning testimony, the spread of the India coronavirus variant and the row about funding of the Downing Street flat.

Even with socioeconomic inequality, which the government is very keen to contrast with racial inequality as being an Actual Problem, its focus is on the schooling of white working-class boys. Why?

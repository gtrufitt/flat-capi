Serving for the game, Williams gets off on the wrong foot with a double fault and then goes long to gift Collins a 0-30 lead. But she leans on all that experience and then muddles through an on-court interview in French. Williams is closing in! She breaks again to go 5-4 up in the second. Collins droops a tame second serve into the net to go 0-30 down and Serena senses the kill, setting up three break points with a driven forehand volley from Collins’ defensive lob and taking the first of them. Williams about to serve for the match. Williams starts the eighth with two service winners before the drama builds with a Serena forehand which smashes into the net but drops back on her own side. But 30-15 quickly becomes ‘Jeu Williams’ as she wins the next two points. There’s another shout of satisfaction: 4-4. The second seed drops just eight games on the way to victory. It’s a dominant display and on he goes to the next round. Meanwhile, it’s Collins’ turn to get frustrated now as she aims a little kick at her racket on the way to being broken in game seven. Williams now serving to level the second set up at 4-4. Williams is now into full gee herself up mode, shouting ‘c’mon’ very loudly several times as she comes back from 0-15 to win the sixth with four straight points. Collins’ lead in the second is cut to 4-1. Back to the Mededev game briefly and the second seed is serving to win the match against Opelka. They’ve been on court just 96 minutes. Collins has all the momentum now. She wins the fifth game to love (that’s eight points in a row) to leap into a 4-1 lead in set two. Collins looks to be sensing something here as she puts away a volley to take the opening point on Serena’s serve. Williams wins the next three before applauding Collins’ deft drop shot at 40-15. Williams then looks rather deflated as the younger American powers a backhand down the line to force deuce and Collins cashes in, forcing a break and then benefitting from a fourth Williams double fault. Collins leads 3-1 in the second set and has the break. Williams berates herself for a loose cross-court backhand which sails way out, giving Collins a 2-1 lead. The total points count, if that really means much, is close: Williams 41, Collins 40. Williams breaks Collins in the opening game of the second set but she’s still hitting the odd strange shot and her opponent has three break points to hit back in kind. Collins takes the third one although is handed it via a Serena double fault. 1-1. Medvedev has a break in the third set against Opelka and now leads 3-1. It seems there is little the 32nd seed can do after winning just seven games so far. Another seed with a two-set lead is Carreno Busta (12), who takes the second 6-4, just as he did the first. Johnson just serving at the start of the third. Back out to Court Suzanne-Lenglen and Medvedev is now two sets up (6-4, 6-2) against Opelka. Everything ticking along nicely for the second seed. It’s 1-1 in the third. Williams takes the first set against Collins, winning it 6-4 in 41 minutes. A pair of double faults - her first of the contest - leave Serena looking shaky at 0-30 but, helped by a fifth ace at 30-30, she reels off the next four points to see it out. Williams has a break point in the eighth but Collins holds firm to stay in the set. Serena now serving to win it. She’s hit four aces so far. Thanks Luke. Just checking and Serena Williams hasn’t won a Grand Slam since the 2017 Australian Open. It’s dangerous to write these sporting legends off though. Who would have thought at the start of 2019 that the next couple of seasons would bring major wins for Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson? Serena keeps getting to semis and finals although she’s not done much here in recent years admittedly. And with that, I will love you (in a tennis sense) and leave you. David Tindall will guide you through the rest of the afternoon’s action. If you get a chance to catch the highlights or a replay of Alejandro Davidovich Fokina’s five-set epic against Casper Ruud, make sure you do it! It was ace. Over to you, David. Opelka holds for 5-2. Williams and Collins, meanwhile, are with serve at 3-3 in the first. On Court Simonne Mathieu, Pablo Carreño Busta (12) leads Steve Johnson 4-2 in the second set, having taken the first 6-4. Medvedev leads Opelka 5-1, closing on a two-set lead in under an hour. Opelka booms down a couple of big serves as he tries to stay in the second set. Giron hits back against Garin on Court 7 and takes the second set 7-5. Garin won the first 6-1. Out on Court 14, another women’s singles match has just got under way: Sorana Cirstea (ranked 54) v Daria Kasatkina (ranked 37). Williams and Collins are locked at 2-2 in the first on Court Philippe-Chatrier. Medvedev breezes to a 3-0 lead in the second set against the man-mountain Opelka. Medvedev is outclassing Opelka, he’s 2-0 up in the second set, having taken the first 6-4. Williams, meanwhile, makes Collins work to hold her second service game of the match. Collins, who is ranked 50, eventually does so and leads 2-1 in the first, with serve. Check out this Medvedev return. Tasty. The seventh seed Serena Williams - three times a women’s singles champion at Roland Garros - is on court and in action against Danielle Rose Collins, who also hails from the USA. Collins has held serve and is 1-0 up so far, with Williams in her first service game as I type. Medvedev wins the first set, 6-4. His opponent Reilly Opelka is 6’11” tall, by the way. He’s sporting an eye-catching pink outfit with a white cap. He is the joint-tallest player ever on the ATP Tour, tied with Ivo Karlovic. Beat that! Medvedev will serve for the first set against Opelka. He’d never won a match at Roland Garros before this year. (Thanks Eurosport for the factoid.) Cristian Garin (seeded 22) took his first set against Marcos Giron, 6-1, and now leads 3-2 in the second. Pablo Carreño Busta, meanwhile, seeded 12th, fought back to win the first set against Steve Johnson, 6-4. A great moment. Phew, what a wonderful display. Right - what else is going on? The ice-cool Russian, Medvedev, is 4-3 and a break up against Opelka on Court Suzanne Lenglen. Wow - that was just stunning tennis. Davidovich Fokina produces a huge serve, Ruud can only pat it back long, and Davidovich Fokina sinks to the clay, looking simply stunned at having finally got over the line and achieved a fantastic result against the 15th seed. He’s into the last 16 of a slam for the second time in his career. What a performance! What a match! There is loads of respect between these two young players as they greet each other at the net. A tremendous display from both men. Well played! Davidovich Fokina meets Delbonis in the next round. Davidovich Fokina saves Ruud’s latest break point with a punishing smash to the body. The crowd are in raptures ... WOW! Davidovich Fokina now jumps into a backhand and smokes it across the court! It’s another match point after 15 minutes of this game ... and he’s done it!!!! Ruud gets back in Davidovich Fokina’s face with two excellent, excellent forehands and gets a break point. Davidovich Fokina tries a cheeky underarm drop serve at break point! Ruud nets the return! Davidovich Fokina sends that fourth match point long. Deuce No 6. This is draining to watch. Davidovich Fokina dumps an easy forehand into the net! Back to deuce again ... and another massive first serve, and a fourth match point for the Malaga man! Here’s a report from Tumaini Carayol of today’s action, including Sabalenka’s exit against Pavlyuchenkova: Back to deuce - Ruud falls over and hits a backhand wide, and it’s another match point for Davidovich Fokina, his third. Can he seal it? Davidovich Fokina gets a second match point ... and hits a forehand into the net, going for glory! Now a break-back point for Ruud - but Davidovich Fokina cracks an ace down the middle! “You couldn’t have scripted it any better,” insists the Eurosport man on the mic. Commentary bingo! Ruud is under all sorts of pressure but tries a lob ... Davidovich Fokina slips as he attempts to get back to return it! The umpire comes for a look at the mark, and rules that the lob touched the line. Huge drama! The 21-year-old Davidovich Fokina, who hails from Malaga, finds a stunning drop shot for match point! Very, very impressive from the 22-year-old Caspar Ruud, hitting the ball crisply all around the court, moving in behind a big forehand, and earning a break point ... but Davidovich Fokina serves big, and it’s deuce! In this five-set belter, Ruud is 15-30 on Davidovich Fokina’s serve now ... But he mishits a forehand, and it’s 30-30. The young Spaniard is two points away. Second seed Daniil Medvedev has begun his third-round match against Reilly Opelka over on Court Suzanne Lenglen. In addition, Pablo Carreno Busta and Steve Johnson are in the first set, with Johnson 4-3 up right now. Stunning backhand pass from Davidovich Fokina! A fourth break point for the Spaniard ... and he makes it! Ruud sends the ball long and Davidovich Fokina can serve for the match. Cor! Biiiig backhand winner from Davidovich Fokina to bring it back to deuce on Ruud’s serve. And now Ruud earns a third break point of the game against his better-ranked opponent. So, on Court 14, it’s a real classic unfolding. Ruud (seeded 15) is serving to save a couple of break points against Davidovich Fokina. He wins a long, punishing rally for 30-40, then produced an ace for deuce! The fans are transfixed by this one. C’est ça. Zverev holds to love, and reaches the fourth round for the fourth year in a row. Djere will be kicking himself, still, about that second set. But it’s all good experience. It’s now 5-5 over on Court 7. “Vamos!” yells Davidovich Fokina as he holds serve. Djere manages to hold serve. Yet Zverev will serve for a straight-sets win and a place in the last 16 of the French Open. He is 5-2 up. Ruud leads 5-4 against Davidovich Fokina, with the latter serving to stay in the match. Djere has a game point - but double-faults. His body language is awful, he just doesn’t want to be out there anymore, knowing it’s only a matter of time before his misery is ended by Zverev. Zverev and Djere are at deuce. Zverev can smell blood, and takes on a big backhand after a massive forehand return to start with, but it falls just long. Ruud and Davidovich Fokina now locked at 4-4 in the fifth. Zverev eases into a 5-1 third-set lead. He is one game away from the last 16 at Roland Garros. Ruud and Davidovich Fokina are treating the sodden fans to a classic on Court 14: Ruud leads 4-3 in the fifth and final set. Meanwhile, Marcos Giron and the 22nd seed Cristian Garin have just started their third-round match on Court 7. The common or garden Roland Garros super slow-mo celebration replay: This is going to be over fairly quickly, it seems: Zverev has just eased into a 4-1 third-set lead against his demoralised opponent. 6-2, 7-5, 4-1, and Djere (which the commentators are pronouncing ‘Jerry’) is staring down the barrel. Don’t forget, you can email or tweet me with your thoughts on the action if you so wish. Email here or tweet @lukemclaughlin Love hold for Zverev. He’s won eight out of nine games now. Djere holds for 2-1. His loyal band of supporters clap their hands and cheer. Their man is fighting again, having been so annoyed at the way he lost the second set. Zverev is still in control mind you. The narrative seems to have been set, but can Djere again find that level he achieved in the second set, when he was matching - and bettering - the German in the longer exchanges? Zverev has gone 2-0 up in the third set now and has won seven games in a row. The commentator Jo Durie has just mentioned reading our news story about Yana Sizikova’s arrest in a match-fixing investigation. Here’s the piece from Tumaini Carayol: The 27th-seeded Italian is dumped out, surprisingly, and the world No 51 Delbonis reaches the last 16 of a slam for the first time. Zverev has a little row with the umpire about a line call. Djere has a break point, and tries to win it with a lob, but it drops long, and Zverev has avoided letting that little disagreement with the umpire put him off. “Word gets round the locker room very quickly if you’re a quitter,” observes Jo Durie in the commentary box, suggesting that Djere has to keep motoring here and avoid a complete capitulation, which would cost him in terms of his reputation among his fellow pros. Zverev crunches an ace down the middle as if to reinforce his dominance. He then produces a 135mph serve, his quickest of the match, and unsurprisingly wins that point as well. A clean winner from Djere on Zverev’s second serve, though, now brings deuce. Djere’s focus seems to have evaporated after he threw away that second set - or had it wrestled from him by his opponent Zverev. The German breaks to move 1-0 ahead in the third set and it feels very much as if Zverev has a total strangehold on his match. Djere, it emerges on replay, smashed a ball into the stands in pure frustration on losing that last game. Casper Ruud and Alejandro Davidovich Fokina are into a fifth set: Ruud just won the fourth set 6-0. Delbonis is on the verge of beating Fognini in straight sets. “Come on!” Zverev yells in delight after winning the second set and understandably so - he saved three set points at 5-3 and 40-0 down. Djere came from two sets down to defeat Miomir Kecmanović a couple of days ago, but it is very hard to see him pulling off the same here. Zverev moves 6-5 up with another break of serve and Djere is visibly disgusted with himself, after having three set points a few moments ago. Zverev to serve for a two-set lead. Laaksonen has packed it in against Nishikori. The German holds for 5-5, despite a double fault during that game. Here’s a big test for Djere, who could do with a nice easy hold to calm his nerves. But he’s not getting many free points from Zverev right now. Zverev breaks to make it 4-5! That’s some serious fight from Zverev, who was a point away from ceding the first set. Djere crashes a ball into the clay in frustration - he should be home and dry in this second set, but now he’s in a dogfight. Great hustle from Zverev as he fights back from 40-0 down to deuce, with Djere on the verge of sealing the set ... and now he wins a break point! Delbonis has gone 3-0 up in the third against the racquet-puncher Fognini. Nishikori, meanwhile, has won the first set against Laaksonen, 7-5. The umpire calls for new balls after Zverev holds serves to make it 5-3. Zverev has drifted out of this match somewhat, and Djere will now serve for the second set. Djere, the 26-year-old Serbian, holds to lead 5-2. Break for Djere! He seals it by winning the best rally of the match! It’s 4-2 and we’ve got ourselves a game on. Djere mixed it up nicely in that long rally, holding back with a sliced backhand here and there, and showing impressive patience before stretching Zverev sufficiently to force the error from his opponent. Zverev nets a backhand, while on the run, and Djere is well in control of this second set at the moment. Djere moves to 0-30 on the Zverev serve, partly thanks to a double fault. He takes on a big down-the-line winner to try and earn three break points but again, it’s just outside the tramline, and perhaps he didn’t need to take that on. Anyway, he does eventually earn a break point, at 30-40 ... In terms of power, Zverev has looked a little less dominant in the last few minutes, but suddenly he fires back with a fizzing double-handed backhand that is simply too hot for Djere to handle. Zverev goes on to earn two break points at 15-40 ... and he wins the first one as Djere sends a forehand an inch or two wide. Zverev breaks back, and it’s 3-2 in the second set. Djere tries an astonishing cross-court pass on the first point of Zverev’s service game, but it drops fractionally wide. However, it’s another sign that the Serbian is feeling confident and ready to take shots on, where previously he looked tentative and nervy. Zverev holds, and it’s 3-1 in the second. Djere, all of a sudden, clearly believes he can match Zverev in the longer rallies. He gets the better of the German in a long exchange at deuce on his own serve, smashing a volleyed winner to the corner, and then converting his advantage to lead 3-0 in the second set. He has a small band of vocal fans who are on their feet and singing as their man begins to grow into this match more and more. Rain-soaked fans are currently cheering on the Roland Garros ground staff as they try to clear water from the uncovered courts: Three break points for Djere! He converts the first thanks to an unforced error by Zverev, who sends a forehand wide, and Djere leads this second set 2-0. That game was a scrappy affair from the German and Djere is back in this. Beautiful play from Zverev, getting right over the top of Djere’s second serve, and returning it with punishing force and accuracy to his opponent’s forehand side. Djere manages to stay in the point for a few shots, but it’s only a matter of time, and Zverev clips an efficient volley to the corner which Djere can’t reach. All that said - Djere holds serves after all, and leads the second set 1-0. Zverev has won 73% of points on his first serve, and 83% on his second. Zverev holds to love, with no momentum shift in sight for Djere. He takes the first set 6-2. Here is Fognini punching his racquet a little earlier: Fognini, apparently, punched the strings of his racquet and needed a medical timeout, with claret everywhere, in his ongoing match against Delbonis. Now, Zverev is serving for the set. Boom! Djere pounces on a rare short ball from his opponent and crushes a forehand winner to the corner. It’s 5-2. Far too early to suggest that’s a momentum-shifter of a shot, but it will feed the Serbian’s confidence a little. Deuce on Djere’s serve. Zverev engineers a delicate drop shot from the baseline, and Djere can’t get there fast enough to dig it out. Break and set point. Zverev goes for glory with a brave forehand down the line, but it’s just wide, and back to deuce. Zverev goes 5-1 up. Djere capitulated in that game to a certain extent with a couple of sloppy errors. He immediately finds a very good winner to begin his service game, however. With his flowing locks of fair hair, bandana and copious gold jewellery (including a medallion), there is a distinctly 1970s vibe to Zverev’s look. Nothing wrong with that, either. Meanwhile, Djere gathers himself to hold serve to love, which is a foothold in the match, and it’s 4-1. Zverev closes out another comfortable hold with a cleanly-hit ace. It’s 4-0. Zverev breaks again! He’s 3-0 up and playing some accomplished stuff against Djere, the Hungarian who is ranked 55. Meanwhile, Delbonis is two sets to the good against Fognini: 6-4, 6-1, while Nishikori leads Laaksonen 6-5 in the first on Court Simonne Mathieu. Rain stops play on the other courts as it hammers down on the recently closed roof of Philippe-Chatrier. Concerning news: Russian tennis player Yana Sizikova has been arrested in Paris by French police as part of a match fixing investigation. Here is Tumaini Carayol’s story: Zverev forces deuce on Djere’s serve, crafting a rally beautifully from the back of the court, varying the pace and direction of his shots, before ending it with a cross-court forehand pass that loops away from Djere - who can only shake his head and wonder how he is going to live with this quality of hitting from the other side of the net ... Zverev moves 2-0 up by holding his first service game. Then there’s a lovely forehand winner, angled down the line, as a reminder to Djere that merely holding serve isn’t going to be entirely straightforward against a player of Zverev’s calibre. Thanks David. All happening: Zverev breaks Djere at the first time of asking. Meanwhile, the retractable roof above Philippe-Chatrier is being closed to keep the rain out, which has obviously now rolled over Paris, having been soaking the south of England for most of the morning. These players are famously tough, though, and are carrying on regardless as the roof closes above them with not a towel in sight. I’ll hand you back to Luke McLaughlin to bring hot news of the lengthy first game in the Zverev-Djere clash. Big applause now on Philippe-Chatrier as Alexander Zverev, the sixth seed, starts out against Serbia’s Laslo Djere. It’s their first meeting at Roland Garros. Zverev was a quarter-finalist here in both 2018 and 2019 while going out in the fourth round last year. The German made the final of the 2020 US Open but lost a five-set thriller to Dominic Thiem after being two sets up. Nishikori has three break points in the fifth game but can’t take any of them. Laaksonen survives that but Nishikori holds serve and then breaks to love in the seventh to go 4-3 ahead. A couple of stats to tell the story of the Azarenka v Keys game. Keys hit nearly three times as many winners (17 to Azarenka’s 6) but made a whopping 33 unforced errors in the 16 games they played. Azarenka’s count was 12. Out to Court Simonne-Mathieu now where Japan’s Kei Nishikori is doing battle with Switzerland’s Henri Laaksonen. It’s early days, with former US Open finalist Nishikori holding in the fourth game to make it 2-2 in the first set. Out on Court 14, Norway’s Casper Ruud continues to have his problems against Alejandro Davidovich Fokina. The Spaniard won the first set on a tie-break before 15th seed Ruud hit back to take the second 6-2. But Davidovic Fokina is now 3-0 up in the third. All over! Azarenka mistakenly thinks she’s served an ace at 30-30 but it’s called out. The second serve is long and the double fault gives Keys a break point but she hits a poor groundstroke halfway up the net, audibly giving herself a ticking off. Azarenka misses a first match point by going wide with a forehand and Keys hits a superb winner to save a second. But it’s third time lucky as another Keys error and an accurate serve down the middle from Azarenka seals a comfortable and deserved 6-2 6-2 victory. Azarenka, aided by a little luck at 30-15, holds serve to go 5-2 up. No margin for error now from Keys. Over on Court Suzanne-Lenglen, Federico Delbonis leads Fabio Fognini, the 27th seed, 5-4 in the opener and will be serving to win the set. Azarenka doesn’t wilt and survives some heavy Keys groundstrokes to reel off the next three points and take it to 30. The 15th seed leads 4-2 and is now just two games away from victory. Keys holds to reduce the deficit to 3-2 and now she’s 30-15 up on the Azarenka serve in the next. A change in momentum here perhaps. Keys gets a game back by winning the fourth but is still a break down at 1-3 in the second set against Azarenka. Thanks Luke. I’ll try and be the no-frills doubles partner that hogs the net and blocks a few back. Azarenka goes 3-0 up in the second, having won eight games in a row. Keys is not at the races. In the men’s singles, meanwhile: Alejandro Davidovich Fokina won his first set against Casper Ruud on a tie-breaker, but Ruud has just gone 4-1 up in the second set. And Federico Delbonis is 3-1 up on Fabio Fognini in their first set. Now, it’s time for me to hand over to David Tindall, and I’ll be back soon for the afternoon’s action ... Over on Philippe-Chatrier, Azarenka has broken Keys in the second and leads 2-0 after winning the first set 6-2. On Court 7, Zidansek and Siniakova are into a third and final set. Siniakova dominated the first set, 6-0, before Zidansek took the second set on a tie-breaker. All over. Pavlyuchenkova reaches the last 16 for the second time in her career - the last time she did so was 10 years ago. Sabalenka, in the second set, started to hit the ball in fearsome style and took it comfortably, 6-2. Pavlyuchenkova took a medical timeout - I am not sure what the problem was - and all the momentum that the world No 4 had built up seemed to disappear. However, Pavlyuchenkova played an excellent match, was far more consistent than her opponent, who produced a litany of unforced errors and is knocked out. At least Sabalenka will be able to say she took her shots on, and went down all guns blazing, even if blazing in accurately for the most part. Sabalenka edges to 30-30 with Pavlyuchenkova serving for the match. Can she strike back and find something in this third set? Azarenka wins the first set against Keys, 6-2. Break point for Pavlyuchenkova - and Sabalenka loses her composure again and crashes a big forehand very wide. It’s 5-0 in the deciding set, and surely, it’s all over. Now 4-0, as Pavlyuchenkova holds, and moves a step closer to the last 16. Sabalenka double-faults to kick off this service game, which she has to win to retain a slender chance of recovery. Deep trouble for Sabalenka, who now falls 3-0 behind in the third and final set. The precision of Pavlyuchenkova has been eye-catching in these past three games. Can Sabalenka, the world No 4, harness her power effectively once again as she did in that second set? Super stuff from Pavlyuchenkova, working her opponent around the court and fashioning the chance for a winner, and she has a chance to move 2-0 up in this decisive set ... which she does! Much as in the first set, frustration is creeping in for Sabalenka. Sabalenka makes it to 0-30 on her opponents serve, then nets a shot, much to her frustration. A brilliant volley from Pavlyuchenkova, on her toes, makes it 30-30 and now Sabalenka forces a break point. Azarenka has broken Keys, and leads 4-2 in the first. Pavlyuchenkova breaks! You have to wonder what the medical issue was. A cynic may suggest she simply took a few minutes out to try and stop Sabalenka’s momentum, which was looking unstoppable. Pavlyuchenkova is now back on court for the third set against Sabalenka. The No 3 seed is serving first in this deciding set. She double-faults twice to hand her opponent two break points. As suspected, that break for the medical timeout hasn’t done Sabalenka any good. Azarenka holds for 2-2 in the first set against Keys. Both have started the match well, both striking the ball sweetly, and looking pretty evenly matched in the rallies. Pavlyuchenkova has just walked off court for a medical timeout. If nothing else, that will interrupt Sabalenka’s rhythm: she was seeing it like a football in that second set, which she won 6-2. It’s with serve in the Azarenka v Keys match, at 2-1 to Keys, although it’s 30-30 on Azarenka’s serve now. In the battle of the Elenas, Rybakina has knocked out Vesnina, 6-1, 6-4. Sabalenka takes the second set, 6-2. Pavlyuchenkova simply couldn’t live with her opponent’s power and precision during that set. Sabalenka lacked precision in the first set, but has certainly found her range now, and there is going to be plenty of work to do for Pavlyuchenkova now. This is great to watch from Sabalenka, unless you are Pavlyuchenkova’s coach. Seemingly effortlessly she goes to 0-30 with a pass and a cleanly returned winner. And now to 0-40, three set points. The quality of Sabalenka’s hitting is looking more and more ominous for Pavlyuchenkova now. Sabalenka holds for 5-2, peppering her opponent with powerful groundstrokes, including one superb clean winner on her forehand side. Picturesque. An astonishingly good double-handed backhand return, which almost kisses the line right in the corner, creates two break points for Sabalenka. Pavlyuchenkova did not have a hope of getting close to that one. Sabalenka converts the first break point, and leads 4-2. She doesn’t over-celebrate, either, but looks quietly satisfied that her power hitting is starting to tell on the scoreboard. A comfortable Sabalenka hold for 3-2 in the second set. Meanwhile, Victoria Azarenka (15) and Madison Keys (23) are about to begin their third-round match on Court Philippe-Chatrier. Pavlyuchenkova, who is certainly looking the more consistent player, holds for 2-2. Sabalenka’s power is unstoppable when she gets it right, and she it not hesitating to attack, but she is also making too many errors in comparison with her opponent at the moment. Sabalenka puts away a forehand volley efficiently and holds comfortably for 2-1. Sabalenka has started this second set with renewed focus and is hitting the ball with serious authority compared to the second half of that first set. She goes on the attack to try and save a game point at 40-30, but sends a forehand wide, and it’s 1-1. Sabalenka holds serve impressively to open the second set, winning the first point with a cute drop-shot, and the second with another booming groundstroke to the baseline. Rybakina and Vesnina are now 2-2 in the second set, after Rybakina took the first 6-1. Over on Court 7, Katerina Siniakova took her first set against Tamara Zidansek 6-0, but Zidansek now leads 3-2 in the second. Pavlyuchenkova moves in behind a first serve and volleys decisively to take the first set, 6-4. It was very much a set of two halves, with Sabalenka sprinting out of the blocks and into a 3-0 lead. But a catalogue of errors by the Belarusian handed the initiative to Pavlyuchenkova, who won five straight games and sealed the set comfortably in the end. Unforced errors all over the place from Sabalenka. She dumps the first return of the game into the net, then sends a backhand long to gift Pavlyuchenkova a 30-0 advantage. Sabalenka holds, sealing the game with a big serve that was called out by a line judge. The umps leaves his seat to take a look at the mark, and rules it good. However, the Russian Pavlyuchenkova will now serve for the first set, at 5-4. A smart serve-volley from Pavlyuchenkova sees her save the break point, and she then takes the game for 5-3 in the first set. Sabalenka is clearly a bit frustrated with her game, and is occasionally venting her anger by winding up a huge forehand, or an unreasonably powerful second serve. Pavlyuchenkova attempts a delicate drop-volley which would put her 40-0 up on her serve, but places it fractionally wide. Sabalenka forces it to 30-30, and then absolutely destroys a brilliantly powerful forehand down the line for a break point. Much more like it from the Russian. Tennis - bloody hell! Pavlyuchenkova has now won four straight games and leads 4-3 in the first set. This one could get interesting. It’s 3-3 and all square in the first set between Pavlyuchenkova and Sabalenka. Sabalenka finds a couple of break points now, but the 29-year-old Pavlyuchenkova does well to bring it back to deuce in this sixth game of the first set. Our Eurosport commentator informs us that this is the 14th time Pavlyuchenkova has played at Roland Garros, which is quite a record. Sabalenka now saves a game point with a few massive groundstrokes that wear Pavlyuchenkova down with sheer force ... however, the Russian eventually finds a way. And now Pavlyuchenkova finds a break of her oppenents serve, and is right back in this first set at 3-2. Pavlyuchenkova is now on the board: it’s 3-1 in Sabalenka’s favour. Elsewhere, Elena Rybakina (21) now leads Elena Vesnina 5-0 in their first set. On Court Simonne Mathieu, Aryna Sabalenka (3) has raced into a 3-0 first-set lead against Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova (31). Sabalenka is the top-seeded player left in the women’s competition, following the withdrawals of Ash Barty and Naomi Osaka. The debate on Naomi Osaka’s withdrawal from this tournament rumbles on. Watch a video explainer, featuring the thoughts of our tennis reporter Tumaini Carayol, right here: Yesterday we saw Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Iga Swiatek, among others, progress safely to the third round at Roland Garros, while the women’s world No 1, Ash Barty, was forced to retire from her match against Magda Linette with a hip injury. There was also a notable flare-up over slow play between Federer and his opponent Marin Cilic. There was no shortage of action and drama on Thursday, so what will Friday bring? In the women’s singles, Victoria Azarenka faces Madison Keys from 11am, and Serena Williams will be on court at 3pm for a third-round match against compatriot Daniel Rose-Collins. In the men’s singles, Alexander Zverev is due on court at 11.15am to meet Laslo Dere of Hungary, and two hours after that, Daniil Medvedev will face off against the American Reilly Opelka. Those are just a few of the matches on today’s menu, which will no doubt be full of skill, intensity, super slow-motion replays, and frequent use of the towel.

New orders for US-made goods fell by 0.6% in April, a bigger decline than the 0.2% dip expected, following a 1.4% rise in March. Orders for motor vehicles and parts fell by 6.1% --- with the global shortage of semiconductors hitting the sector. Today’s jobs report will intensify the debate over labor shortages, says Daniel Zhao of Glassdoor: The report doesn’t end the debate around labor shortages, but instead will provide ammo to both sides of the political debate. The slower-than-expected job gains and drop in labor force participation will be pointed to as evidence that the recovery is being held back by workers staying out of the labor force. Conversely, leisure &amp; hospitality leading job gains despite widespread reports of shortages will be pointed to as an argument for why labor shortages are not significantly impeding job gains. For now, the rising leisure &amp; hospitality earnings seem to be the strongest evidence that labor shortages are happening, but the report doesn’t definitely signal what’s the reason for these shortages. Michelle Meyer, head of U.S. economics at Bank of America Corp, warns that shortages of parts and labor held back job growth in May. So while hiring did accelerate as the jobs market strengthened, with payrolls increasing by 559,000 last month after a revised 278,000 gain in April, it was below Wall Street forecasts of around 650,000 extra hires. Meyer says: “On the surface, yes, the jobs numbers were strong, a half million jobs is obviously a good thing, but given where we are in the economy, all else equal it could have been stronger,” “The fact that it wasn’t is likely a function in large part to supply constraints and labor shortages.” More here: U.S. Job Growth Picks Up in Sign of Progress on Filling Openings Marty Walsh, US Secretary of Labor, says there are ‘good, positive signs’ in today’s jobs report. Walsh told CNBC that the light at the end of the tunnel is starting to get larger, pointing to the job gains in hospitality and education. He’s hopeful that more people will get back into work in the next couple of months, with hospitality and leisure likely to keep hiring as demand picks up through the summer. On the $300 UI supplemental benefit (which some people claim is deterring people from returning to work), Walsh says it played a vital role helping people through the pandemic. But if the labor market does continue to recover, he’d expect fewer people to be signing on for unemployment insurance (benefits), especially as new jobless claims hit a pandemic low yesterday. He adds: This is a good solid report...and we need to continue making gains like this. And on the 0.5% rise in wage growth, Walsh says his office are watching very closely to see the impact of wage increases on inflation. The US added 559,000 jobs in May as the coronavirus pandemic receded, shaking off fears of a substantial slowdown in hiring after April’s disappointing monthly report. The Bureau of Labor Statistics said Friday that the unemployment rate had fallen to 5.8% from 6.1% in April, still significantly higher than the 3.8% unemployment rate recorded in February 2020 before Covid 19 hit the US but less than half its 14.8% peak in April last year. The news comes one month after the labor department shocked economists by announcing the US had added just 266,000 new jobs in April – far below the 1m gain that had been expected. May’s gains were less than economists had predicted and with the level of employment is still 7.6m jobs below its pre-pandemic peak, economics group Capital Economics calculates it would take more than 12 months at the current pace to fully eradicate the shortfall. April’s report led to sparring between the Biden administration and Republicans who claimed higher levels of unemployment benefits were keeping people from returning to work and this month’s lukewarm report is unlikely to end that row. But there are signs of a strong rebound across the US economy. Worker filings for unemployment benefits have dropped by 35% since late April and fell to a pandemic low of 385,000 last week, the labor department said Thursday. Here’s the full story: Ben Casselman of the New York Times has written a really interesting Twitter thread, highlighting some key points from the US jobs report: The US dollar has lost ground following the jobs report. That also suggests traders are more confident that the Federal Reserve won’t tighten its bond-buying stimulus program soon, with employment gains below forecasts. This has pushed the pound up by almost a cent today, to nearly $1.42, close to the three-year high of $1.425 set earlier this week. Tech stocks, which are sensitive to interest rate concerns, are leading the risers on the Dow. Intel (+1.4%), Microsoft (+1.36%), Salesforce.com (+1.2%) and Apple (+1%) are all rallying following the jobs report. Drinks giants Coca-Cola and construction equipment maker Caterpillar are both up 1.1%, suggesting optimism about the economic recovery and the reopening trade. The US stock market has opened higher, as Wall Street traders welcome today’s Non-Farm Payroll report. The 292,000 increase in leisure and hospitality jobs shows that the economy is recovering. Plus, the weaker-than-expected payroll gains could calm worries that the Federal Reserve feels pressure to slow its bond-buying programme soon. Dow Jones industrial average: up 142 points or 0.4% at 134,719 S&amp;P 500: up 25 points or 0.6% at 4,218 points Nasdaq Composite: up 125 points or 0.9% at 13,740 points Mike Bell, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, says the 559,000 payroll increase is a ‘Goldilocks’ number (as every child knows, she liked her porridge not too hot, or too cold). “Another weaker than expected payrolls number is allowing investors to relax a little about the prospect of Fed tightening, while still demonstrating that the hardest hit sectors of the labour market are bouncing back. “This goldilocks scenario of a labour market recovery that is not too cold to raise concerns about the economy, but not too hot to prompt fears about faster than expected monetary policy tightening, is supportive of equity markets.” Adding over half a million new jobs would be ‘amazing’ in a normal month, says Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics. But these are not normal times....and job creation is slower than hoped. The 559,000 gain in non-farm payrolls in May was at least an improvement on the 278,000 gain in April but, with the level of employment still 7.6 million below its pre-pandemic peak, it would take more than 12 months at that pace to fully eradicate the shortfall. Only a few months ago we had expected to see several months’ worth of gains north of one million as the economy reopened, but labour supply is bouncing back much more slowly than demand.... Overall, in any other set of circumstances, monthly gains in excess of half a million would be amazing but, with a 7.6 million shortfall, it will be some time at that pace before the Fed’s “substantial further progress” has been met. Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, says the US jobs market has moved into ‘second gear’. He’s encouraged by the rise in teaching and childcare jobs (see earlier post). “The May jobs report was a major improvement over April’s, but we’re still not in full-speed-ahead mode, despite plummeting COVID-19 cases. That the economy is reopening was evident in the near 300,000-job increases in leisure and hospitality, which account for half the total increase. Also significant: the high numbers of teachers and childcare workers hired back. This should have a multiplier effect on jobs in the coming months, as working parents who needed to stop or curtail working due to kids at home can resume their careers. Evidence that many workers in the labor force are choosing to stay on the sidelines: the labor force participation rate is still low at 61.6%. Overall, this is hiring in second gear, and we have the potential to accelerate once some bottlenecks and barriers to working disappear.” Willem Sels, chief investment officer, Private Banking and Wealth Management, HSBC, says there’s little danger of a ‘broad-based wage spiral’ breaking out: “Following the big disappointment in the payroll data last month, today’s non-farm payroll release was closely watched, as investors assess whether the factors that limited job creation last month would be temporary or have persisted. In the end, the number bounced a bit less than expected, and there were no material revisions to last month’s number. It seems that some of the factors that weighed on the numbers last month are slowly easing, and that there continues to a be a slow but gradual return of workers to the labour market, but slower than expected. In our view, unemployment remains too high for a broad-based wage spiral to develop. Average hourly earnings in the US continue to rise last month, up around 0.5%, which may indicate that some firms are lifting pay to attract workers. That includes a rise in average hourly pay at leisure and hospitality firms (from $17.86 in April to $18.09 in May), where there have been reports of staff shortages. However, this has been a tricky area to analyze, because the pandemic has hit lower-paid jobs harder. The Bureau of Labor Statistics says: Average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls increased by 15 cents to $30.33 in May, following an increase of 21 cents in April. Average hourly earnings of private-sector production and nonsupervisory employees rose by 14 cents to $25.60 in May, following an increase of 19 cents in April. The data for the last 2 months suggest that the rising demand for labor associated with the recovery from the pandemic may have put upward pressure on wages. However, because average hourly earnings vary widely across industries, the large employment fluctuations since February 2020 complicate the analysis of recent trends in average hourly earning. More than half the 559,000 new jobs created in May were in the leisure and hospitality trade, where payrolls swelled by 292,000 as people flocked to bars and restaurants. Nearly two-thirds of the increase was in food services and drinking places (+186,000), with another 58,000 new jobs in amusements, gambling, and recreation, and 35,000 in accommodation. But, leisure and hospitality is still missing 2.5 million jobs since the pandemic began. In education, employment rose by 144,000 -- including 53,000 in local government education, by 50,000 in state government education, and by 41,000 in private education. Health care and social assistance added 46,000 jobs, including 22,000 new jobs in “ambulatory health care services”, and 18,000 in child day care services (perhaps reflecting increased demand from parents returning to work). Employment in information rose by 29,000, including 14,000 in motion picture and sound recording industries. Manufacturing employment rose by 23,000. That included a 25k gain in motor vehicles and parts, following a 38k fall in April (blamed on shortages of key parts such as computer chips). Transportation and warehousing added 23,000 jobs, while employment in wholesale trade increased by 20,000. But construction employment fell by 20,000, mainly due to job losses for nonresidential specialty trade contractors (-17,000). That may be due to the shortages of materials that have hit builders in America (and beyond...). Although below expectations, May’s job growth is an improvement on April’s weak payroll report. Zach Moller of Third Way Economic says there is “steady improvement”, thanks to the Covid-19 vaccine rollouts. The US unemployment rate has fallen to 5.8%, from 6.1%, the jobs report shows. That’s partly thanks to firms taking on another 559,000 staff last month, helping to bring more people back into work. The BLS says: In May, the unemployment rate declined by 0.3 percentage point to 5.8%, and the number of unemployed persons fell by 496,000 to 9.3 million. These measures are down considerably from their recent highs in April 2020 but remain well above their levels prior to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic (3.5 percent and 5.7 million, respectively. But...the labor force participation rate has dipped to 61.6% from 61.7%. That can be a sign that more people have stopped looking for work, and dropped out of the jobs market (this can happen for many reasons, perhaps childcare commitments, or a lack of suitable vacancies...) Just in: The US economy added 559,000 jobs in May, as hiring falls below expectations for the second month in a row. Economists had expected around 650,000 new workers to be taken on last month, as the economy expanded strongly. April’s disappointing Non-Farm Payroll has been revised slightly higher to show 278,000 new hires, up from 266,000, but that still shows weak job growth. This may reinforce concerns that American firms are struggling to find labor amid the reopening rush. The Bureau of Labor Statistics says there were “notable job gains” in leisure and hospitality, in public and private education, and in health care and social assistance (details to follow!) Here’s our news story on the surge in UK construction growth...and costs... last month. Trade news: The United Kingdom has secured a new trade deal with Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. The deal cuts tariffs on some agricultural goods such as UK cheese exports to Norway, along with tariff reductions and quotas on pork, and poultry. UK wines and spirits including Scotch Whisky will also now be recognised in Norway and Iceland, the Department for International Trade says. In return, import tariffs on shrimps, prawns and haddock coming into the UK will be cut. That, the UK says, will cut costs for UK fish processing and support jobs in that sector. The deal also includes a chapter on digital trade -- allowing electronic-only paperwork on goods trade which could make importing and exporting smoother. There’s a cap on mobile phone roaming charges, recognition of professional qualifications, and British businesses can bid for around £200m government contracts in partner countries. Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg told a news conference in Oslo that “the deal allows for growth in trade for both our countries”. But as the BBC points out, the deal won’t give the same opportunities as before Brexit. However, the Norwegian government said the deal with the UK would not restore all the advantages it had when both countries were in the EEA. “Prior to the UK’s exit from the EU, Norway enjoyed free movement of goods, services, capital and persons to the UK through the EEA agreement,” it said. “A free trade agreement will not provide similar access to the British market.” International Trade Secretary Liz Truss says it will boost trade: Today’s deal will be a major boost for our trade with Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, growing an economic relationship already worth £21.6bn, while supporting jobs and prosperity in all four nations at home. Here’s some reaction: It may be too early for a tipple.. but those with a taste for wine may be interested in a new fund-raising drive from English winemaker Chapel Down. My colleague Kalyeena Makortoff has the details: Chapel Down is asking the public to take part in a fresh funding round worth up to £7m that will help the business expand its vineyard in the North Downs and ramp up exports. It is the Kent company’s latest attempt to tap into investor enthusiasm for homegrown tipples as the democratisation of shareholding grows. Chapel Down plans to use the money to scale up its wineries and finish planting grapevines on the North Downs, where its vineyards are expected to produce an extra 500,000 bottles of English sparkling wine a year. Some of the cash will also help develop its online sales portal and export business. A virtual GP appointments app used by the NHS has announced a £3bn US stock market listing after agreeing to a blank-cheque company merger that will net its British-Iranian founder almost £1bn. Babylon’s reverse merger with Alkuri Global, a New York-listed special-purpose acquisition company (Spac), makes it the latest firm to take advantage of a growing Spac trend that makes it cheaper for private companies to go public. The Financial Times explains that regulators in Brussels and the UK have launched “a joint assault” on Facebook’s use of customer data to dominate in core markets such as digital advertising. The Wall Street Journal say the moves are “ramping up regulatory scrutiny for the company in Europe”, adding: Both the European Commission—the EU’s top antitrust enforcer—and the U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority said Friday they are investigating whether Facebook repurposes data it gathers from advertisers who buy ads in order to give illegal advantages to its own services, including its Marketplace online flea market. Bloomberg has more details of the EU’s case: The European Commission said it will investigate whether Facebook misuses a trove of data gathered from advertisers to compete against them in classified ads. It will also check if the company unfairly ties its Marketplace small ad service to the social network. Friday’s move by the EU is the first time it’s escalated a case into Facebook’s behavior beyond the preliminary stages. It follows other high-profile cases targeting Google, Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. The EU previously fined Facebook for failing to provide correct information in the merger review of the WhatsApp takeover. Although the two investigations are separate, they were announced at the same time this morning. And both the UK’s CMA and the EC says they will “seek to work closely” together as these independent inquiries develop. Facebook says it will cooperate fully with both the EU and UK investigations “to demonstrate that they are without merit”. The social network giant explains: “Marketplace and Dating offer people more choices, and both products operate in highly competitive environment with many large incumbents”. We will continue to co-operate fully with the investigations to demonstrate that they are without merit.” Competition regulators in the UK and European Union have both launched investigations into Facebook, examining whether the social media giant is breaking competition rules. The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it will look into whether Facebook is abusing a dominant position in the social media or digital advertising markets, by using advertising data to gain an unfair advantage in the classified ads and online dating sectors. The CMA will examine if Facebook has unfairly used the data gained from its digital advertising services, and from its single sign-on service (Facebook Login), to benefit its own services. In particular, it will look at Facebook Marketplace (which runs classified adverts), and its dating profile service Facebook Dating. Andrea Coscelli, chief executive of the CMA, says the regulator will conduct a thorough investigation. “We intend to thoroughly investigate Facebook’s use of data to assess whether its business practices are giving it an unfair advantage in the online dating and classified ad sectors. “Any such advantage can make it harder for competing firms to succeed, including new and smaller businesses, and may reduce customer choice. Coscelli adds that the CMA will work closely with the European Commission... who have just announced their own antitrust investigation to assess whether Facebook violated EU competition rules. Again, the EC will examine if the tech giant used advertising data gathered in particular from advertisers in order to compete with them in markets where Facebook is active such as classified ads. The formal investigation will also assess whether Facebook has tied Marketplace to its social network, giving an unfair advantage in the online classified ads services and breaching the EU competition rules. It explains that online classified ads providers advertise their services on Facebook’s social network, while also competing with Facebook Marketplace. The EC says: Following a preliminary investigation, the Commission has concerns that Facebook may distort competition for the online classified ads services. In particular, Facebook might make use of the data obtained from competing providers in the context of their advertising on Facebook’s social network, to help Facebook Marketplace outcompete them. Facebook could, for instance, receive precise information on users’ preferences from its competitors’ advertisement activities and use such data in order to adapt Facebook Marketplace Competition chief, and executive vice-president, Margrethe Vestager, adds “Facebook is used by almost 3 billion people on a monthly basis and almost 7 million firms advertise on Facebook in total. Facebook collects vast troves of data on the activities of users of its social network and beyond, enabling it to target specific customer groups. We will look in detail at whether this data gives Facebook an undue competitive advantage in particular on the online classified ads sector, where people buy and sell goods every day, and where Facebook also competes with companies from which it collects data. In today’s digital economy, data should not be used in ways that distort competition.” Economist Richard Ramsey is also struck by the surge in construction costs - both for materials, and subcontractors: That last point suggests tradespeople are responding to the law of supply and demand, and pricing their time accordingly..... The UK building boom means that finding skilled construction workers is a real problem, says Duncan Brock, Group Director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply: “The construction sector continued its expansion programme with a phenomenal acceleration in growth and the strongest for seven years as new orders filled in at the fastest rate for almost a quarter of a century. Residential work was back in the top spot as house building rose at the quickest pace since August 2014, serving as an antidote to the recent scarcity in housing for lets or buy, and driven by consumer demand and a boost from the stamp duty holiday. “Busy purchasing managers were under pressure to keep up and buying up at the fastest rate since April 1997, changing sourcing strategies to find depleting essential materials and stocking up just as supply chain problems continued to mount along with prices. With inflation for goods and raw materials at a 24-year high, companies will be concerned that much-needed profits will be eaten away as building projects take shape and could be held up by some of the longest delivery times on record. Skills shortages are also becoming a problem, with recruiters finding talented labour hard to find, as job creation was at robust levels and the threat of staffing cutbacks has become a distant memory.” This chart, from the PMI report, shows just how badly supply chains are creaking: The surge in input price inflation is quite startling -- it’s being driven by soaring material costs, and shortages of stocks such as timber, roof tiles, paint, taps and concrete. UK building firms are hiring new staff at the fastest rate in seven years, to handle the surge in demand in May. New project starts and a sustained recovery in construction workloads resulted in the biggest jump in staffing numbers since July 2014, the PMI report shows. And with new orders flooding in, sub-contractor usage increased at a survey-record pace. UK construction has recorded its fastest growth in almost seven years, fuelled by the biggest jump in new orders since at least April 1997. The latest survey of UK construction shows that the sector benefitted from surging order books, driven by demand for new homes amid rising economic confidence. However, cost pressures are also at record levels, as builders scramble to find the raw materials and parts they need. That’s according to data firm IHS Markit, whose Construction PMI index has jumped to 64.2 in May, up from April’s 61.6. That shows very fast growth, and is the strongest reading since September 2014 (anything over 50 shows expansion). Markit says the UK construction sector is on a “strong recovery path”, with companies “highly upbeat” about growth prospects for the next year. New order volumes increased at the fastest pace since the survey began just over 24 years ago, while input cost inflation also hit a survey-record high during May. Business confidence among builders also jumped sharply, due to “resurgent customer demand”, and optimism about the UK economic outlook following the successful vaccine roll out. Markit reports: House building (index at 66.3) was the best-performing category of construction activity in May, followed by commercial work (64.4) The latest increase in work on commercial projects was the steepest since August 2007, reflecting strong demand conditions following the reopening of customer-facing areas of the UK economy. Civil engineering activity (index at 61.3) also increased sharply during May, although the pace of expansion eased slightly since the previous month. Tim Moore, Economics Director at IHS Markit, says supply chains are struggling to cope with this rapid output growth, and the surge in new orders to the highest in at least two decades. “There were widespread reports citing shortages of construction materials and wait times from suppliers lengthened considerably in comparison to those seen during April. Imbalanced supply and demand led to survey record increases in both purchasing prices and rates charged by sub-contractors. Despite severe challenges with materials availability, construction firms remain highly upbeat about their near-term growth prospects. Nearly two-thirds of the survey panel forecast an increase in output during the year ahead, while only one-in-thirteen forecast a decline. UK car sales continued to recover from their pandemic lows last month, but remain below their pre-Covid level. A total of 156,737 new cars were registered last month -- a jump of 674% compared with May 2020, during the first lockdown. This follows the reopening of car showrooms, and the relaxing of some pandemic restrictions in April and May. But, the market has not yet returned to normality. Sales are 14.7% lower than in May 2019, and over 13% below their average for the month over the last decade. And so far this year, car registrations are around 29% below their average levels. Sales to companies to businesses or organisations grew more than twice as fast as private purchases in May. These ‘fleet sales’ made up around half of all new vehicles hitting the road last month, totalling 79,435 sales -- ten times higher than a year ago. That shows improving business confidence, says the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said: “With dealerships back open and a brighter, sunnier, economic outlook, May’s registrations are as good as could reasonably be expected. Increased business confidence is driving the recovery, something that needs to be maintained and translated in private consumer demand as the economy emerges from pandemic support measures. Demand for electrified vehicles is helping encourage people into showrooms, but for these technologies to surpass their fossil-fuelled equivalents, a long term strategy for market transition and infrastructure investment is required.” So far this year, plug-in vehicles have accounted for 13.8% of new car registrations, up from 7.2% a year earlier, with plug-in hybrids (PHEV) growing fastest. Fully electric cars have made up 7.5% of sales this year, with pure petrol engines still around half the market. The Covid-19 restrictions on touring and performing are also encouraging artists to cash in the value of their music rights, points out John Coldham, IP partner at law firm, Gowling WLG. Here’s his take on the sale of Joel Little’s song catalogue to Hipgnosis: The trend to buy up the rights to songs continues, with this latest investment being a continuation of that. There is nothing new about rights to creative works being bought and sold, but it is interesting that, as the world evolves into digital streaming, there has been a spate of such high profile sales recently. It is likely that some artists wish to realise the value of their catalogue now, rather than wait for the trickle of streaming revenues to come in, especially as they are not able to perform live so easily in the present environment. These sales demonstrate the value of intellectual property, and ensuring its ownership is properly documented will assist in realising that value later. Music news: Grammy Award-winning songwriter, producer and musician Joel Little has become the latest musician to sell their works to Hipgnosis Songs Fund. Little has worked with several leading musicians - including Taylor Swift, and Lorde, co-writing and producing her debut EP and her first album, Pure Heroine’. The sale of Little’s musical catalogue comes amid the boom in streaming under the pandemic. Several other big music names have also taken this move; Hipgnosis have recently signed deals with the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Neil Young, Fleetwood Mac guitarist Lindsay Buckingham, and Barry Manilow, along with Metallica and Michael Bublé producer Bob Rock. Reuters has more details: Little, whose songs Hipgnosis says have been streamed over 15 billion times, co-wrote and produced four songs on Swift’s 2019 album “Lover,” including “Me!” and “The Man”. He has also collaborated with U.S. R&amp;B singer Khalid, and in 2014 won a Grammy award with New Zealand singer Lorde after co-producing and writing “Royals”. In 2014 Little co-wrote or produced songs for the “The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 1” movie. The catalogue totals 178 songs, Hipgnosis said in a statement, and between 2017-2019 earned revenue of $8.6 million. It did not disclose the size of the deal. With airlines under pressure, the London stock market is effectively becalmed this morning. The FTSE 100 index has dropped by 10 points, or 0.15%, to 7054 points while the more UK-focused FTSE 250 is flat. Traders are keeping firmly to the sidelines ahead of May’s US jobs report -- to see whether hiring bounced back, and whether wages are rising (cue more fretting about inflation). Connor Campbell of SpreadEx explains: Analysts’ estimates have the nonfarm number climbing to 645,000 [from 266k in April], with the unemployment rate falling from 6.1% to 5.9%. Average hourly earnings are, as ever, the one outlier, with expectations of 0.2% against the previous month’s 0.7%. Considering that nonfarm forecast lies somewhere between the levels expected last month, and the number produced last month, it will be interesting to see how investors react. It might hit that sweet spot – strong enough to point to a continuing recovery, but not strong enough to prompt any action from the Fed. Although the travel sector is clearly struggling, the wider UK economy is rebounding from the pandemic. Overnight, a survey has shown that British employers took on permanent staff last month at the fastest rate since at least the late 1990s. There was also a rush for short-term staff, with temporary staff placements growing at the fastest in six years, according to the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) trade body and accountants KPMG. Kate Shoesmith, REC deputy chief executive officer, said. “We now have a consistent picture over the past few months to show that confidence is growing and hiring plans are in motion.” The survey also found that companies are struggling to hire staff, due to pandemic uncertainty and fewer candidates from the EU. And that drove starting salaries rose last month, at the fastest rate since September 2018 -- in a boost to workers. Shoesmith said: “With demand spiking, the skills and labour shortages that already existed in the UK have come into sharper focus – and COVID has only made them worse.” AJ Bell financial analyst Danni Hewson says the UK’s new tighter travel restrictions are causing ‘aftershocks’ in the travel sector today: “The travel sector continued to see aftershocks from yesterday’s earthquake decision to remove Portugal from the green list of travel destinations from the UK. Hopes of anything approaching a normal summer for the industry now look pretty much over. “Domestically the hospitality sector will be hoping that a full reopening is still on the cards for the 21 June but creeping concern about the threat posed by the Delta variant may send any decision on this to the wire – which is clearly exceptionally unhelpful for businesses.” Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Travel stocks are sliding this morning after the UK government removed Portugal from the “green list” of countries exempt from significant travel restrictions, The decision to move Portugal to the amber list is a major blow to the airline sector - just weeks after the UK lifted restrictions on international flights. It has prompted warnings of a deepening crisis for aviation, with unions urging the ministers to provide more support. The move was bitterly criticised by the tourism industry, which had been hoping for more countries to be added to the ‘green list’, meaning passengers wouldn’t need to quarantine on their return. So the news that Portugal will moved to Amber on June 8th, while seven countries, including Egypt and Sri Lanka, are now on the “red list” of destinations that require hotel quarantine, has jolted the sector. Jet engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce, whose engine servicing business is dependent on planes racking up flying hours, are down almost 2.5% this morning, the biggest faller on the blue-chip FTSE 100. Shares in British Airways-owner IAG have dropped another 1.5% in early trading, adding to their 5% slide on Thursday as the Portugal news emerged. Travel stocks are also among the fallers on the FTSE 250 index, with budget airline easyJet dropping by 1.5% (it also fell 5% yesterday). Wizz Air, which warned this week that it would make another loss unless restrictions were eased, are down 2.5%. In Dublin, Ryanair have dropped another 1%. The move has also hit the cruise sector, where Carnival are down 2%. Yesterday’s selloff wiped around £2bn off travel stocks, as the prospect of revenues from Portugal trips faded. Transport secretary Grant Shapps blamed concerns of a new coronavirus mutation and rising cases for the move; although Portugal called the decision ‘unfathomable’. Airlines hit out at the plan, with EasyJet’s boss, Johan Lundgren, saying: “The government has torn up its own rulebook and ignored the science, throwing people’s plans into chaos, with virtually no notice or alternative options for travel from the UK. This decision essentially cuts the UK off from the rest of the world.” Unions are also concerned about the move, with prospect general secretary Mike Clancy warning that the industry risks losing ‘half of the summer’. “This news today is further evidence of the instability facing the aviation industry this summer. With government advice shifting regularly it is imperative that proper financial support for the sector is put in place. “Even in the most optimistic scenario, we now face losing half of the summer before holidaymakers can confidently book travel to major destinations, and the nearer we get to the school holidays the more likely they will be to just stay at home. Given the uncertainty, Clancy adds, the government must consider doing more to help the sector - or risk seeing travel firms collapse - pushing up unemployment. “The government starts phasing out its lifeline furlough scheme in four weeks’ time which is only adding to the damaging uncertainty facing aviation. Ministers need to make clear that further support will be available to support jobs while restrictions on tourist travel remain in place. Without this, there’s a risk that the industry will no longer be there when restrictions are lifted.” Also coming up today Investors are bracing for the latest US jobs report, the Non-Farm Payroll, which will show whether hiring in America recovered in May after slowing in April. Economists predict around 650,000 new hires last month, up from 266,000. A jump in employment would clearly be very welcome, as the US economy is still missing eight million jobs since the pandemic. But a stronger-than-expected NFP could also jolt the markets, intensifying concerns about inflation- and the possibility that central bankers end their stimulus programmes. Ricardo Evangelista, senior analyst at ActivTrades, explains: The narrative in the markets has been dominated by the risk of high inflation becoming a collateral effect of the ongoing gargantuan stimulus. The Fed has, so far, refused to blink, insisting that any spikes in prices are likely to be temporary and that bringing forward the tapering could damage the economic recovery. Amidst this tug-of-war, employment is likely to become a decisive factor, with a high reading having the potential to force the Fed to start thinking about tapering its current monetary and asset purchase policies. Looking at today’s dollar gains, it appears that many investors are already positioning themselves for such a scenario. G7 finance ministers are meeting in the UK for two days of talks, where they will try to hammer out a landmark deal to end tax avoidance by multinationals and big technology companies using tax havens to exploit loopholes in the global system. The UK and Norway are close to signing a trade deal, with a formal announcement expected as soon as today.

To do this, they are placing their hopes on an unassuming, poisonous plant called milkweed. Monarch butterflies, known for their distinctive orange and black pattern, once flocked to California in the millions, spending the winter clumped on trees as they migrated to and from the state’s central coast. But the population has sharply declined from 4.5 million in the 1980s, dropping to nearly 200,000 in recent decades before taking a precipitous dive in 2018.

It’s great to see people rallying to save these animals.” The headline of this piece was amended on Friday 4 June 2021 to clarify that the extinction threat refers to western, not eastern, monarch butterflies.","charCount":"5631","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/erin-mccormick\">Erin McCormick</a> in Berkeley"},{"headline":"National Theatre commits to more plays from outside London","standfirst":"<p>Reopening plans include a musical based on Sleeping Beauty and a play telling the story of Gandhi’s killer</p>","trailText":"Reopening plans include a musical based on Sleeping Beauty and a play telling the story of Gandhi’s killer","byline":"Mark Brown Arts correspondent","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d0f7601e2cd666d3ba7268b50ae54f012473d2d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d0f7601e2cd666d3ba7268b50ae54f012473d2d6/0_151_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People pass signs outside the theatre\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The National Theatre, on the South Bank in central London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>At least a third of new work supported by the National Theatre will in future come from artists, venues and producers outside London, part of a campaign to help British theatre get back on its feet after the devastation of the pandemic.</p> <p>On Friday the theatre announced reopening plans which will include a new musical based on Sleeping Beauty; and a new play for the Olivier stage telling the story of Nathuram Godse, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/from-the-archive-blog/2011/may/27/guardian190-gandhi-obituary-1948\">the devout follower of Gandhi who became his assassin in 1948</a>.</p> <p>It also publicly launched National Theatre Together, described by the NT’s artistic director, Rufus Norris, as “a campaign that seeks to ensure we emerge from this time into a bright and creative future”.</p> <p>Norris said the theatre’s new work department was returning to full strength “and we are even more committed to opening our doors to artists and theatre makers from across the whole breadth of the UK to support the sector, to flourish after the devastation of the past year”.</p> <p>He added: “At least a third of the new work department’s capacity and resource each year will now be committed to developing ideas with the specific focus on work to be produced outside London.”</p> <p>All three South Bank theatre spaces are beginning to reopen for live audiences for the first time since March 2020.</p> <p>The biggest space, the Olivier, reopens for socially distanced audiences in a fortnight with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/mar/25/michael-sheen-under-milk-wood-national-theatre\">Under Milk Wood, starring Michael Sheen</a>.

On Friday the theatre announced reopening plans which will include a new musical based on Sleeping Beauty; and a new play for the Olivier stage telling the story of Nathuram Godse, the devout follower of Gandhi who became his assassin in 1948. It also publicly launched National Theatre Together, described by the NT’s artistic director, Rufus Norris, as “a campaign that seeks to ensure we emerge from this time into a bright and creative future”. Norris said the theatre’s new work department was returning to full strength “and we are even more committed to opening our doors to artists and theatre makers from across the whole breadth of the UK to support the sector, to flourish after the devastation of the past year”. He added: “At least a third of the new work department’s capacity and resource each year will now be committed to developing ideas with the specific focus on work to be produced outside London.” All three South Bank theatre spaces are beginning to reopen for live audiences for the first time since March 2020. The biggest space, the Olivier, reopens for socially distanced audiences in a fortnight with Under Milk Wood, starring Michael Sheen. Shows later in the year include Paradise by Kae Tempest, Larry Kramer’s The Normal Heart, and the Sleeping Beauty musical titled Hex for which Norris has written lyrics and will direct. The book is by Tanya Ronder, Norris’s wife, with music by Jim Fortune. The Gandhi play, titled The Father and the Assassin, is written by Anupama Chandrasekhar, a former NT writer-in-residence. Like all arts organisations, the National Theatre will have to operate with a slimmed-down business model. That will mean “slightly fewer productions” and none in rep, it said. The theatre has lost a third of its workforce, drained its reserves and had to take on a £19.7m survival loan from the government, to be repaid with interest over the next 20 years. Lisa Burger, joint chief executive, conceded that the loan meant it would be “cushioned” if theatres are not allowed to fully reopen on 21 June. Andrew Lloyd Webber has threatened legal action if theatres can’t reopen. Norris said: “We don’t take quite such a hard line and we won’t be going to court over that, but I totally respect other people’s decisions to do as they see fit.” Norris said the loan came with no conditions, that it would have no effect on artistic decisions and that risk-taking would continue.

At that valuation, Getir, founded in 2015, is worth more than the takeaway courier group Deliveroo and big retailers such as Marks &amp; Spencer and Morrisons. Investors are racing to get a foothold in the rapidly developing market for groceries which can be delivered in less than 20 minutes from local “dark stores”. More than $14bn has been piled into the market globally since the start of last year according to analysts at PitchBook. Gorillas, the German grocery delivery firm that launched in the UK in March, is reportedly aiming to raise $1bn in a deal that would value the company at over $6bn despite having only operated for just over a year. Berlin-based Flink also announced on Friday that it had raised $240m to expand its business into more cities and countries. Such services, which include Gorillas, Weezy, Dija and Fancy, are seen as pandemic winners, with numerous high-street lockdowns around the world spurring a big rise in online shopping, particularly in groceries.

I’d better concentrate on the round-up for a bit, I’ll leave you with Glamorgan strolling to 43 without loss, needing another 145 to beat Lancashire. Fifties for Miles Hammond at Gloucestershire 58 not out, and for Dawid Malan at Headingley, where he and Gary Ballance have put on 81 for the third wicket. Yorks 176-2 Durham all out 381. They’re becoming batting specialists. Tongue 4-73. Worcester, I’m afraid, are in deep trouble needing 251 to make Durham bat again. I haven’t been watching at New Road - has the pitch changed from the minefield it was on Thursday (at least in Worcester’s mind.) Does anyone know why the flush isn’t working? I suppose I better go and find out. In other news, Glamorgan are 25-0, a couple of fours each for Cooke and Lloyd. Group one Derby: Derbyshire 121 v Warwicks 274 and 26-3 Chelmsford: Essex v Notts 248-6 no play today, rain Worcester: Worcester 131 all out v Durham 369-9 Group two Grace Road: Leicestershire 451 v Gloucestershire 85-2 Taunton: Somerset 360 all out v Hampshire 157-6 Group three Sophia Gardens: Glamorgan and 0-0 v Lancashire 173 and 164 Glamorgan need 188 to win Canterbury: Kent v Northamptonshire 362-5 no play today, rain Headingley: Yorkshire 153-2 v Sussex 313 all out Rain, rain and more rain at Chelmsford, with large puddles developing at the River End. Essex need the points more than group-leaders Notts. Sam Northeast has gone at Taunton for a hard-working 67 as Tom Abell makes a crucial breakthrough. Hampshire continue to edge forward, just 206 behind. They’ve taken tea at Sophia Gardens, with the promise of an entertaining run-chase to toast day. Invaluable nurdling from Saqib Mahmood and Danny Lamb at the end. Neser 4-53, two each for Lamb and Douthwaite. Northants knew what they were up to yesterday, banging out four bonus points while the sun shone. Pennington back in the wickets at New Road, with numbers 7 and 9. Durham lead by 219. Warwickshire are a-crumbling in their second innings. Currently 5-2 after four overs, with Pieter Malan and Will Rhodes’s afternoon closed. The lead 159. Teenage kicks: Yorkshire 130-2. Follow on NOT enforced by Warwickshire, who bat again with a first-innings lead of 153. Meanwhile Sam Northeast has tacked together a valuable fifty at Taunton, paying what I think they described as a “holding-role” in football. Hampshire 124-5. Not many centuries this round (Brown, Harris and Bedingham, I think), but another beauty from Bedingham who is providing welcome heft to the Durham middle order. The lead over Worcestershire now 202. The last wicket stand added a sixth of the runs after a collapse of 8-45. Norwell 4-24, Miles 5-30. Will they follow on? We wait.... Still no play at Kent, Chelmsford or Lord’s. For balance, the top ten leading wicket-takers this season: Rushworth (Durham) 37 Coverton (Somerset) 36 Fletcher (Notts) 36 Abbott (Hants) 34 Harmer (Esses) 34 Higgins (Gloucs) 33 Sam Cook (Essex) 32 Carse (Durham) 32 Olly Robinson (Sussex) 29 Bamber (Middx) 28 [Broad has 19 from four games, Wood 10 from three games, Anderson 3 in two games but one innings] Hampshire 110-5, as James Hildreth at slip says thank you to a softly-dropping plum from Liam Dawson. Ah! Thank you Gary. O youth! The strength of it, the faith of it, the imagination of it! Ibrahim strikes with ball. Kohler-Cadmore lbw for 25. Yorkshire 83-1. Like a moonlit shadow, Derbyshire dance where Lancashire tread. From 76-2 to 98-7. Craig Miles 4-26, Norwell 2-20. A breakthrough at Taunton! James Vince is caught at backward point after an uncharacteristically patient 29. Hampshire 100-4. I’ve learnt that Dan Ibrahim is now the youngest player to make fifty on debut in the Championship. The previous record was held by Bilal Shafayat - who in my mind played a Test for England, but my mind is wrong. Cricinfo confirms U19 England caps and a glorious season in 2005 when he made 1000 runs for Notts. Gosh Lancashire really are, um, getting a move on. They’ve now lost 5-11, with Vilas and Bailey joining the heavy pavilion-trudge. Three for Neser, one for Douthwaite and a run out. Currently, 125-8, a lead of 148. That run-out : And a reminder of the owner of that mellifluous welsh voice: Eddie Bevan of course. Thank you! Hopes of a tea-start at Lord’s Glamorgan’s statement on welcoming fans back to Sophia Gardens: We welcome today’s announcement from the Welsh Government of a return of spectators to watch live events in Wales this summer. The two metre social distancing regulation will restrict our capacity to a maximum of 2,892 and we will continue to work closely with key partners including the Welsh Government, Public Health Wales, and Cardiff City Council on a safe return of fans to Sophia Gardens. We have prepared and submitted proposals for a phased return of fans to Sophia Gardens from next week and look forward to providing more information as soon as the necessary approvals have been confirmed. Once again, we would like to thank our members, fans and partners for their patience and look forward to welcoming supporters back to Sophia Gardens in greater numbers. Gary Naylor confirms a Lancs-up in progress. Here’s the first of the three to fall since lunch: A post-lunch trickle: Madsen and McDermot shot out by Miles (3-23) at Derby: 82-4, 192 behind Warwicks. Chris Wright picked off by Hammond at the run-fest at Grace Road, Leicestershire 439-8. Oh dear, and Lancashire have lost 3-4 at Sophia Gardens: Bohannon, Livingstone, and Wood run-out without facing a ball. Lancs 113-6. Just watered the garden for the first-time in a while, cautiously optimistic about the soft-fruit season. Talking of which... ah, no-one has collapsed in the ten minutes since lunch. Group one Derby: Derbyshire 61-2 v Warwicks 274 Chelmsford: Essex v Notts 248-6 no play before lunch Worcester: Worcester 131 all out v Durham 252-4 Group two Grace Road: Leicestershire 436-7 v Gloucestershire Taunton: Somerset 360 all out v Hampshire 67-3 Group three Sophia Gardens: Glamorgan 150 all out v Lancashire 173 and 88-3 Canterbury: Kent v Northamptonshire 362-5 no play before lunch Headingley: Yorkshire 26-0 v Sussex 313 all out Godleman straggles back to the Derby pavilion after being caught behind for 32. Derby 61-2 shortly before lunch. At Headingley, the Yorkshire openers are still whole, if with an uneven scorecard. Kohler Cadmore one not out; Lyth 16 not out including a morning heave-ho for six! Yorks 22-0. David Bedingham is the only man with more than 700 runs this season - and still he bats. Currently 65 not out at New Road as Durham sail into a sobering lead: 241-4, a lead of 112 over Worcestershire. Al Davies and Luke Wells steaming along at Sophia Gardens, but Keaton Jennings’ more circumspect innings is over. Lbw to Weighell for 12. A bump down to earth in this game after his classy hundred last week. Lancashire 72- hang on, they’re now 72-2. Wells bowled for 26 by Douthwaite. Sussex all out 313! Now Yorkshire get a go. Will it be the Yorkshire of the first innings of the Roses match -159 all out - or the Yorkshire who battled to so-close to the bitter end in the second innings? This is just showing off! Gloucestershire having a spell in the doldrums. Leicester now 411-7, with a helpful 47 extras. And, in case this appeals: No dream debut for Ibrahim, but dreamy enough. Well played, young pup. Sussex 310-8. Lunch will be taken at 1pm at Lord’s, where the rain continues to pour. Hampshire, meanwhile, are in trouble: 31-3 after de Lange removes Steel and Alsop in one over. Holland already gone, caught VDM off Davey. Just perusing the Championship averages as if it was 1985 and they were taking up a whole page in the Telegraph. The highest England players are 7th placed Ollie Pope (78.83) and 8th placed Rory Burns (53.73) Top ten: Van der Merwe, Somerset Bedingham, Durham Carlson, Glamorgan RS Patel, Surrey MS Harris, Leicestershire Vasconcelos, Northants Pope, Surrey Burns, Surrey MAH Hammond, Gloucestershire Abell, Somerset Derbyshire have lost their first wicket, 8-1, but Durham billow onwards, Beingham and Jones steadfast in a partnership of fifty. Their lead over Worcestershire an almost commanding 53, with six wickets remaining. The lovely voice of the Glamorgan commentator is lulling me into a trance, but can report that at Derby Warwickshire are all out for 274, an impressive effort by Derby, who are already batting and 7-0. There will be an inspection at Canterbury at 12.20. How’s that on debut?! Seven fours and as calm as a tarn on an early spring morning. Ticket offer!!! Brian Withington has very kindly offered two free tickets for England v New Zealand at Edgbaston next Friday June 11th to a lucky BTL-er.

Any enlightenment gratefully received At Headingley, Ben Coad grabs Sussex’s main man, centurion Ben Brown. Sussex 275-6 with 16-year -old Ibrahim not out 43. He’s “doing a Conway.” Lancashire not hanging around. This could be all over today at the Gardens. Jennings and Davies march back out, Davies is off the mark with four and Lancashire are 6-0, with a first-innings lead of 23. And Ali’s nice report on Conway, Wood, Robinson, Root and co And Simon Burnton on the fallout from the Robinson affair. We’re rolling! Except at Canterbury, Chelmsford and Lord’s where the rain doth spout and spoil things. Some fabulous reading from the Test. I thought this was brilliant on Ollie Robinson by Andy Bull. On a morning of cloud cover so heavy that the Headingley floodlights were switched on, and 2,056 souls planted their behinds around the ground for the first time for a men’s county game since 2019, Yorkshire chose to bowl. With Sussex 68 for four just after lunch, it seemed a good decision. By stumps, less so, thanks to a smashing unbeaten 126 from Ben Brown, 40 from Aaron Thomason and a cameo of 37 from 16-year-old Danial Ibrahim. Brown played with nimble feet and hands, running swiftly between the wickets and driving with panache, picking the gaps ably, like a pick-happy man with an orange pith obsession. Ibrahim was sighingly calm, straight drive here, flick there, making the most of late-afternoon Yorkshire bowling with the new ball that touched on the wayward. Northamptonshire, the gluttons, bolted down four batting points before the close in a riotous day’s batting against Kent. Ricardo Vasconcelos and Emilio Gay put on 135 for the first wicket, before Gay, who made his maiden first-class century, and Luke Procter added 100 for the second. Darren Stevens, aged 45, picked up a couple of wickets with the second new ball to lead a mini-revival at the close. There were two catches for Kent’s wicketkeeper Ollie Robinson, who received an apology from Kent Online, who had mistakenly pictured him in Wednesday’s story about the other Ollie Robinson. Lancashire were squirrelled out by Glamorgan for 173 after a succession of batsmen got in, but then got out again, without adding greatly to the score. Tom Bailey scored a quickfire 31 to raise spirits, before picking up three wickets, as did Sajid Mahmood, as Glamorgan collapsed to 150 for nine. Somerset unveiled their usual back-to-front batting style against Hampshire, reeling at 43 for five, laughing at stumps, 360 all out. Keith Barker grabbed six for 72, picking off the Somerset top order – none who passed double figures apart from Steven Davies. The rearguard started with 45 from Tom Banton, and was bolstered by an eighth wicket stand of 171 between Lewis Gregory (107) and Roelof van der Merwe (88). Marcus Harris plundered 148, his second century in succession, put Leicestershire in a happy position against Gloucestershire. They ended the day at 357 for five. Worcestershire crumbled for 131 at New Road as Brydon Carse and Matty Potts snaffled four wickets each. Durham ended the day leading by nine with six wickets in hand, bolstered by 52 from Alex Lees. Fifties from Lyndon James, Steven Mullaney and Joe Clarke, who restarted his innings after retiring hurt, inched Nottinghamshire on to the front foot against Essex. Peter Siddle finished with three for 76. Sam Hain (77) and Michael Burgess (71) kept Warwickshire afloat on a muggy day at Derbyshire. Sam Conners had the top order in a pickle, taking the first four wickets, before the middle-order solidified to see them towards 272 for nine at stumps.

To me, this seems to be going too far.</p> <p>It is highly unlikely, for instance, that one day, attitudes towards smallpox will change so radically that a memorial to Edward Jenner is no longer considered appropriate.</p> <p>It is barely conceivable that one day, the supporters of Stoke City will be embarrassed by the statue of Stanley Matthews outside their stadium because they have come to consider him a poor footballer.</p> <p>And I suspect that there will never be a campaign to tear down the memorial to the abolitionist Thomas Clarkson in my home town, Wisbech. One could go on.<br><strong>Gerrard Raven </strong><br><em>Teddington, London</em></p> <p>• I agree that monuments primarily reflect the values of the culture they were built for. I do, however, find it interesting that Gary Younge writes: “Nobody is seriously challenging the statue of the suffragist Millicent Fawcett in Parliament Square, because nobody seriously challenges the notion of women’s suffrage.”</p> <p>In an era when democracy is being eroded by the far right, <a href=\"https://www.hopenothate.org.uk/research/state-of-hate-2021/\" title=\"\">rampant misogyny</a> and conspiracy theories, there are many who <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/dyv7by/anti-feminist-gen-z-boys-who-hate-women\" title=\"\">do argue against the right to vote</a> and would happily see her statue removed. While cultural mores do change, shouldn’t we strive to publicly represent the paramount importance of democracy, equality and liberalism, which are so integral to the better future of our descendants? It may not be history, but it can still be vital. <br><strong>Toby King</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>• Gary Younge’s thoughtful and entertaining article on public statues had one small omission. Why not emulate the Glaswegian example, where the equestrian statue of the Duke of Wellington outside the Gallery of Modern Art has been behatted with a traffic cone since the 1980s? Puts the worthy chappie in perspective, and the cone-related merchandise in the museum shop is also a useful income generator.<br><strong>Dr Ron Fraser </strong><br><em>Swallowfield, Berkshire</em></p> <p>• I disagree with Gary Younge about the fate of statues of unsavoury people. We need to be reminded of our past, the good and the bad guys. For example, the eulogy on the Edward Colston plinth could – as was once proposed – have been replaced by a more accurate and complete description, listing not only his fortune, but also the number of slaves who died in his service. The same could be done for most statues.<br><strong>Tim Gossling </strong><br><em>Cambridge</em></p> <p>• Gary Younge mentions the argument that “to change something about a statue is to tamper with history.

To me, this seems to be going too far. It is highly unlikely, for instance, that one day, attitudes towards smallpox will change so radically that a memorial to Edward Jenner is no longer considered appropriate. It is barely conceivable that one day, the supporters of Stoke City will be embarrassed by the statue of Stanley Matthews outside their stadium because they have come to consider him a poor footballer. And I suspect that there will never be a campaign to tear down the memorial to the abolitionist Thomas Clarkson in my home town, Wisbech. One could go on. Gerrard Raven Teddington, London • I agree that monuments primarily reflect the values of the culture they were built for. I do, however, find it interesting that Gary Younge writes: “Nobody is seriously challenging the statue of the suffragist Millicent Fawcett in Parliament Square, because nobody seriously challenges the notion of women’s suffrage.” In an era when democracy is being eroded by the far right, rampant misogyny and conspiracy theories, there are many who do argue against the right to vote and would happily see her statue removed. While cultural mores do change, shouldn’t we strive to publicly represent the paramount importance of democracy, equality and liberalism, which are so integral to the better future of our descendants? It may not be history, but it can still be vital. Toby King London • Gary Younge’s thoughtful and entertaining article on public statues had one small omission. Why not emulate the Glaswegian example, where the equestrian statue of the Duke of Wellington outside the Gallery of Modern Art has been behatted with a traffic cone since the 1980s? Puts the worthy chappie in perspective, and the cone-related merchandise in the museum shop is also a useful income generator. Dr Ron Fraser Swallowfield, Berkshire • I disagree with Gary Younge about the fate of statues of unsavoury people. We need to be reminded of our past, the good and the bad guys. For example, the eulogy on the Edward Colston plinth could – as was once proposed – have been replaced by a more accurate and complete description, listing not only his fortune, but also the number of slaves who died in his service. The same could be done for most statues. Tim Gossling Cambridge • Gary Younge mentions the argument that “to change something about a statue is to tamper with history. This is such arrant nonsense … Statues … are not themselves history.” But he later writes: “Statues always tell us more about the values of the period when they were put up than about the story of the person depicted.” Precisely. That in itself is a useful source of history. Mike Morrogh Kew, London • Pilar Quinteros’s sculptural head Janus Fortress: Folkestone, looking both to Europe and the UK, is made of chalk and plaster, and is intended to gradually erode and disintegrate.

Faith’s new piece is built around autobiographical testimonies of isolation and research into the challenges faced by coastal towns with underfunded services, presenting “a society at tipping point”.

Duke performs live on 5 June and it’s available again on 6 June.

You’ve read the scripts. Maybe you’ve even seen the stage show more than once. But you’ll probably still be streaming Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s performance of her wildly successful monologue, recorded at Wyndham’s theatre in London, where it sold out in the summer of 2019. Fleabag is available to stream from Amazon Prime, as part of a partnership with the National Theatre that includes three other NT Live favourites: Hamlet with Benedict Cumberbatch; Frankenstein with Cumberbatch and Jonny Lee Miller and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/ian-mckellen\">Ian McKellen</a>’s 80th-birthday solo show.

It explores, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/aug/12/play-about-christopher-alders-death-to-be-turned-into-film\">says the playwright</a>, “the negotiations that black people need to make in order to do things that seem simple to others”. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/feb/25/typical-review-richard-blackwood-christopher-alder\">Read the five-star review</a>.</p> <h2>The Inquest</h2> <p>Fancy solving a crime from your sofa? This piece of puzzle theatre invites audiences to crack clues with strangers – or you can arrange a private show to team up with your pals. Viewers turned jurors are presented with a tangled web of evidence from a cold case and assisted through their deliberations by the performers Joe Ball (as a coroner) and Tom Black (as a police archivist). It’s the second creation from <a href=\"https://www.jurygames.com/the-inquest-home\">Jury Games</a> whose debut, Jury Duty, is still available online. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/jan/27/the-inquest-review-cold-case-mystery-jury-games\">Read the full review</a>.</p> <h2>Myths and Adventures from Ancient Greece</h2> <p>If home-schooling feels like opening a Pandora’s box, well, here’s a fun way to help your kids engage with the Greek myths on the curriculum. Hannah Khalil has created new versions of the tales of Pandora, Persephone, King Midas and Theseus and the Minotaur. They’re intended for those aged three to eight but will appeal to older viewers, too. Available <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZvJ49nF0XmZ8yY89ZpLh3TDET6Uyuxfk\">on YouTube from Waterman’s Arts Centre</a>, they are staged by the director Ian Nicholson and designer Sam Wilde, who brightened up lockdown with their delightful puppet versions of the picture books I Want My Hat Back and <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/471343772?utm_campaign=5370367&amp;utm_source=affiliate&amp;utm_channel=affiliate&amp;cjevent=aca2c6135b0d11eb82d004240a180513#at=178\">Shh! We Have a Plan</a>.</p> <h2>Shipwreck</h2> <p>First staged at the Almeida in 2019, Shipwreck by Anne “Mr Burns” Washburn gave a sprawling account of modern-day American politics and the rise and potential fall of Trump. It was due to be staged at the Public theatre in New York in 2020 but was instead adapted by Saheem Ali as a <a href=\"https://publictheater.org/productions/season/fall-2020/shipwreck/\">three-part audio play</a> in a co-production with Woolly Mammoth theatre company. Set during a getaway for a bunch of friends in upstate New York in 2017, it’s a knotty appraisal of an American moment that, strikingly, already feels like a vanishing era.</p> <h2>What the Constitution Means to Me</h2> <p>Heidi Schreck’s phenomenal Broadway show has received <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/oct/20/what-the-constitution-means-to-me-review-dazzling-shocking-america-indictment\">five-star reviews</a> from Guardian critics on both sides of the Atlantic. Now available to stream <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/What-Constitution-Means-Me/dp/B08KRFX3ZG\">from Amazon</a>, it charts what the supreme law of the US has meant to generations of women, as Schreck recreates the debating competitions she took part in as a teenager. Directed by Marielle Heller, it’s shatteringly funny, deeply disturbing yet imbued with optimism.</p> <h2>The Cost of Living</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9c0283657f01b0964975c05fc66e842cc93480a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9c0283657f01b0964975c05fc66e842cc93480a2/110_0_1640_984/1000.jpg\" alt=\"DV8’s The Cost of Living.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">DV8’s The Cost of Living.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As a tribute to the acclaimed disabled dancer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/oct/28/david-toole-obituary\">David Toole</a>, who died in October, the physical theatre company DV8 have shared their multi-award-winning 2004 film The Cost of Living <a href=\"https://www.dv8.co.uk/projects/archive/the-cost-of-living--film\">online</a>. Shot on location at a faded seaside resort in Norfolk, it follows two street performers (Toole and Eddie Kay) in a portrait of friendship and prejudice, brimming with spellbinding images.

Unmissable.</p> <h2>Pippin</h2> <p>They’ve got magic to do, just for you: the original 1980 Broadway production of the Tony award-winning musical, with catchy songs by Stephen Schwartz and some glorious moves by Bob Fosse, is available to stream on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Pippin-Ben-Vereen/dp/B07RX2HFSR\">Amazon</a>. Ben Vereen is the beguiling leading player of a troupe who may or may not lead the eponymous prince to self-immolation.

Why not do the same for theatre – and why not start with some of the York Mystery Plays, which date back to the 1300s? Four of the biblical dramas, including the story of Adam and Eve, have been <a href=\"https://www.yorktheatreroyal.co.uk/be-part-of-it/collective-acts/the-york-mystery-plays-radio-broadcast/\">adapted for BBC radio</a>, with a cast of community and professional actors for York Theatre Royal’s <a href=\"https://www.yorktheatreroyal.co.uk/be-part-of-it/collective-acts/\">Collective Acts</a> project.</p> <h2>An American in Paris</h2> <p>Feted at the Châtelet in Paris in 2014, Christopher Wheeldon’s resplendent staging of the Gershwins’ classic went on to conquer Broadway and the West End.

Do all those tweets and posts endure for eternity – and who decides? The site-specific theatre company Dante or Die asked such questions, and many more, in a thoughtful and funny 2018 show by Chris Goode that was staged in cafes. It has now been reimagined as a 50-minute video podcast, available from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/aug/24/this-digital-afterlife-mobile-phone-based-show-connects-us-in-our-grief-user-not-found-dante-or-die\">the Guardian</a> until 31 March 2022.</p> <h2>Flight Paths</h2> <p>This production by the theatre company Extant celebrates the rich history of Goze, itinerant blind performers who traditionally travelled around Japan to bring audiences a vast selection of stories – accompanied by music played on their shamisen stringed instruments. <a href=\"https://flightpaths.extant.org.uk/\">Flight Paths</a> fuses old and new, bringing together archive material about the Goze, animation and filmed modern performance, in an accessible hour-long digital experience.</p> <h2>good dog</h2> <p>Arinzé Kene’s poetic 2017 play good dog posed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/feb/09/arinze-kene-play-good-dog-uk-riots-2011-interview\">unanswered questions</a> about the UK’s summer riots of 2011.

Anton Cross stars as a man looking back on his youth, his neighbours and his community. The film was commissioned by The Space and supported by the BBC and Arts Council England.</p> <h2>Charlotte Holmes: Adventure Box</h2> <p>Lockdown restrictions and cancelled travel plans have narrowed horizons for little adventurers. So this “seven-day theatrical experience” for families is both a delight and a relief. Created by Huddersfield’s <a href=\"https://thelbt.org/get-involved/charlotte-holmes/\">Lawrence Batley theatre</a>, <a href=\"https://dukeslancaster.org/charlotte-holmes-adventure-box\">the Dukes in Lancaster</a> and theatre producers <a href=\"https://www.thebigtiny.co.uk/\">the Big Tiny</a>, it’s a series of mysteries encountered by Charlotte, a young girl evacuated to Yorkshire during the second world war. You solve the puzzles by watching jaunty online videos and opening up the envelopes and parcels inside an adventure box sent to you in the post when you book. The Big Tiny’s follow-up, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/jan/05/balthazar-snapdragon-adventure-box-review-magical-distractions\">Balthazar Snapdragon</a>, is just as fun. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/aug/12/charlotte-holmes-adventure-box-review\">Read the full review</a>.</p> <h2>Hamilton</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8e2580bb72a3440eb4647dafec9053347db34367\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e2580bb72a3440eb4647dafec9053347db34367/0_6_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lin-Manuel Miranda and Phillipa Soo in Hamilton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lin-Manuel Miranda and Phillipa Soo in Hamilton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lin-Manuel Miranda’s phenomenal, Pulitzer prize-winning musical about the “10-dollar founding father without a father” was filmed over three nights in New York in 2016 with the original Broadway cast.

Adjoa Andoh stars as Richard and co-directs, with Lynette Linton, a superb cast entirely comprising women of colour including Shobna Gulati and Ayesha Dharker.

There’s Brian Cox as Ian Rankin’s Edinburgh detective John Rebus, Two Doors Down’s Jonathan Watson as a shipyard electrician suffering from exposure to asbestos, and Kate Dickie as brilliant as ever in a monologue by Jenni Fagan. The lineup of Scottish talent is extraordinary – Tam Dean Burn, Rona Munro and Douglas Henshall all contribute – and don’t miss Janey Godley’s two-hander with her adorable sausage dog. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/may/27/scenes-for-survival-review-brian-cox-zoom-inspector-rebus-national-theatre-of-scotland\">Read the full review</a>.</p> <h2>Matthew Bourne’s The Red Shoes</h2> <p>One of the major dance productions cut short by the coronavirus crisis was Matthew Bourne’s tour of The Red Shoes, his rapturously received version of the Powell and Pressburger film.

All available from 11 June. Dep Previously seen at Edinburgh fringe’s Zoo Southside in 2018, this award-winning physical theatre show about death and rebirth is choreographed by Dam Van Huynh and takes its name from the Vietnamese word for beautiful. When the Guardian asked its multinational cast to describe the work in just one word they answered “resilience”, “human”, “introspective” and “alive”.

The films are released weekly, with the complete series available on 10 June. Royal Ballet The Royal Opera House has worked wonders during the pandemic to open up new, live performances and past productions for an audience at home.

Not everyone feels able to talk about it but Fran Bushe put her experiences centre-stage with Ad Libido, a solo comedy theatre show about the problems she had with desire, orgasm and pain during sex.

Lit Sophie Ellerby’s slow-burning drama about looking for love and the fear of being left behind is set over the summer holidays bridging Years 9 and 10 in a Nottingham secondary school.

Available all year on BBC iPlayer. The Macbeths Director Dominic Hill and writer Frances Poet slashed down Shakespeare’s tragedy to create a gripping two-hander thriller staged at the Citizens theatre in Glasgow in 2017. Now it’s a 60-minute film that unfolds in and around the murderous couple’s bed. Charlene Boyd and Keith Fleming reprise their roles. From 3 June. Barnes’ People He is best known for The Ruling Class but many of Peter Barnes’s plays are overdue a revival; so here’s an attractive proposition from Original Theatre Company and Perfectly Normal Productions. It’s a set of four monologues Barnes wrote for Radio 3 in the 80s and includes True Born Englishman, about a Buckingham Palace footman, which was never aired by the BBC and now gets its world premiere. Filmed on stage at the Theatre Royal Windsor, the monologues are performed by Jon Culshaw, Matthew Kelly, Jemma Redgrave and Adrian Scarborough. Streaming until 31 July. Read the full review.

Available until 12 June. Read the full review. Really Want to Hurt Me Written and directed by Ben SantaMaria for his company Flaming Theatre, this monologue charts how pop music and theatre keep a young gay teenager afloat as he experiences bullying and isolation in 80s Devon. It’s performed by Ryan Price at Theatre503 in London in 2018, filmed by My Reel Productions, before the show went on an acclaimed UK tour. Northern Ballet Yorkshire’s high-flying ballet company presents a pay-what-you-can digital season including short new premieres and the full version of Cathy Marston’s acclaimed regal spectacular Victoria. Choreographer Kenneth Tindall and film-maker Dan Lowenstein collaborate on Northern Lights, which brings dancers to the streets of Leeds, and Tindall’s Have Your Cake takes inspiration from the nation baking banana bread in lockdown. Ballet Black’s Mthuthuzeli November presents What Used To, No Longer Is, choreographed and created entirely remotely. National Theatre at Home After the success of its weekly Thursday night streams during lockdown, the NT launched a catalogue of past hits online. You can either become a subscriber, or pay per play.

New plays are added to the collection each month. Uncle Vanya Ian Rickson’s indelible production of Chekhov’s masterpiece, in a new version by Conor McPherson, was a West End sensation at the start of 2020. After it closed early due to the pandemic, Rickson and producer Sonia Friedman reunited most of the cast for this innovative filmed version. Each performance rings true – from Toby Jones in the title role to Aimee Lou Wood’s Sonya, Richard Armitage’s Astrov and the always excellent Rosalind Eleazar as Yelena. And Bruno Poet’s lighting and Rae Smith’s set design combine to spellbinding effect. On BBC iPlayer. Earwig With the stage out of bounds, theatre-makers are devising ever more creative sonic experiments to be enjoyed at home. Directed by Finn den Hertog and composed and sound-designed by Danny Krass, Earwig is billed as a series of “audio drama podcasts” from the Tron in Glasgow. There are half a dozen of them, written by playwrights based in Scotland, including Stef Smith, Hannah Lavery and Jo Clifford. Designed to be listened to on headphones. Read the full review. Typical In 2019, Richard Blackwood gave a compelling performance at the Edinburgh fringe and Soho theatre in a monologue retelling the story of British-Nigerian Christopher Alder, the decorated paratrooper from Hull who died while handcuffed on the floor of a Humberside police station in 1998. Now, the acclaimed play by Ryan Calais Cameron has been turned into a film directed by Anastasia Osei-Kuffour. It explores, says the playwright, “the negotiations that black people need to make in order to do things that seem simple to others”. Read the five-star review. The Inquest Fancy solving a crime from your sofa? This piece of puzzle theatre invites audiences to crack clues with strangers – or you can arrange a private show to team up with your pals. Viewers turned jurors are presented with a tangled web of evidence from a cold case and assisted through their deliberations by the performers Joe Ball (as a coroner) and Tom Black (as a police archivist). It’s the second creation from Jury Games whose debut, Jury Duty, is still available online. Read the full review. Myths and Adventures from Ancient Greece If home-schooling feels like opening a Pandora’s box, well, here’s a fun way to help your kids engage with the Greek myths on the curriculum. Hannah Khalil has created new versions of the tales of Pandora, Persephone, King Midas and Theseus and the Minotaur. They’re intended for those aged three to eight but will appeal to older viewers, too. Available on YouTube from Waterman’s Arts Centre, they are staged by the director Ian Nicholson and designer Sam Wilde, who brightened up lockdown with their delightful puppet versions of the picture books I Want My Hat Back and Shh! We Have a Plan. Shipwreck First staged at the Almeida in 2019, Shipwreck by Anne “Mr Burns” Washburn gave a sprawling account of modern-day American politics and the rise and potential fall of Trump. It was due to be staged at the Public theatre in New York in 2020 but was instead adapted by Saheem Ali as a three-part audio play in a co-production with Woolly Mammoth theatre company. Set during a getaway for a bunch of friends in upstate New York in 2017, it’s a knotty appraisal of an American moment that, strikingly, already feels like a vanishing era. What the Constitution Means to Me Heidi Schreck’s phenomenal Broadway show has received five-star reviews from Guardian critics on both sides of the Atlantic. Now available to stream from Amazon, it charts what the supreme law of the US has meant to generations of women, as Schreck recreates the debating competitions she took part in as a teenager. Directed by Marielle Heller, it’s shatteringly funny, deeply disturbing yet imbued with optimism. The Cost of Living As a tribute to the acclaimed disabled dancer David Toole, who died in October, the physical theatre company DV8 have shared their multi-award-winning 2004 film The Cost of Living online. Shot on location at a faded seaside resort in Norfolk, it follows two street performers (Toole and Eddie Kay) in a portrait of friendship and prejudice, brimming with spellbinding images. Available on DV8’s Media Portal for a small membership fee. Unmissable. Pippin They’ve got magic to do, just for you: the original 1980 Broadway production of the Tony award-winning musical, with catchy songs by Stephen Schwartz and some glorious moves by Bob Fosse, is available to stream on Amazon. Ben Vereen is the beguiling leading player of a troupe who may or may not lead the eponymous prince to self-immolation. It’s bizarre and frequently frustrating, but a fascinating chapter of Broadway history. Get the backstage view in the series Fosse/Verdon on BBC iPlayer. The York Mystery Plays This pandemic year has seen a boom in sales for classic fiction as we finally get round to reading famous “bucket list” novels. Why not do the same for theatre – and why not start with some of the York Mystery Plays, which date back to the 1300s? Four of the biblical dramas, including the story of Adam and Eve, have been adapted for BBC radio, with a cast of community and professional actors for York Theatre Royal’s Collective Acts project. An American in Paris Feted at the Châtelet in Paris in 2014, Christopher Wheeldon’s resplendent staging of the Gershwins’ classic went on to conquer Broadway and the West End. It’s available on a new streaming platform, Stage2View.com, which also offers the musicals Kinky Boots and 42nd Street, as well as Michael Grandage’s Mark Rothko drama Red, starring Alfred Molina as the artist. User Not Found When we die, what becomes of our digital identity? Do all those tweets and posts endure for eternity – and who decides? The site-specific theatre company Dante or Die asked such questions, and many more, in a thoughtful and funny 2018 show by Chris Goode that was staged in cafes. It has now been reimagined as a 50-minute video podcast, available from the Guardian until 31 March 2022. Flight Paths This production by the theatre company Extant celebrates the rich history of Goze, itinerant blind performers who traditionally travelled around Japan to bring audiences a vast selection of stories – accompanied by music played on their shamisen stringed instruments. Flight Paths fuses old and new, bringing together archive material about the Goze, animation and filmed modern performance, in an accessible hour-long digital experience. good dog Arinzé Kene’s poetic 2017 play good dog posed unanswered questions about the UK’s summer riots of 2011. Revived for a tour last year, it has now been adapted as a superb 20-minute film, directed by Andrew Gillman and Natalie Ibu for Tiata Fahodzi. Anton Cross stars as a man looking back on his youth, his neighbours and his community. The film was commissioned by The Space and supported by the BBC and Arts Council England. Charlotte Holmes: Adventure Box Lockdown restrictions and cancelled travel plans have narrowed horizons for little adventurers. So this “seven-day theatrical experience” for families is both a delight and a relief. Created by Huddersfield’s Lawrence Batley theatre, the Dukes in Lancaster and theatre producers the Big Tiny, it’s a series of mysteries encountered by Charlotte, a young girl evacuated to Yorkshire during the second world war. You solve the puzzles by watching jaunty online videos and opening up the envelopes and parcels inside an adventure box sent to you in the post when you book. The Big Tiny’s follow-up, Balthazar Snapdragon, is just as fun. Read the full review. Hamilton Lin-Manuel Miranda’s phenomenal, Pulitzer prize-winning musical about the “10-dollar founding father without a father” was filmed over three nights in New York in 2016 with the original Broadway cast. Slated for a 2021 cinema release, it was instead fast-tracked on to the Disney+ streaming service. It’s directed by Thomas Kail, who staged the musical, and according to Miranda gives “everyone the best seat in the house”. Watch it once and, to quote Jonathan Groff’s frothing King George III, You’ll Be Back. Read the full, five-star review. As Waters Rise Ben Weatherill’s play is set in the year 2025 when a flood has left Britain in a state of emergency. Originally planned for a stage production, it is now a three-part audio drama directed by Alex Brown and featuring teenage actors from the Almeida Young Company, who recorded their parts in isolation during lockdown. Released as part of Shifting Tides, the Almeida’s digital festival about the climate emergency, aimed at and created with 14- to 25-year-olds. Read the full review. Culture in Quarantine The BBC’s Culture in Quarantine programme on iPlayer includes Jade Anouka and Grace Savage’s Her &amp; Her; Crystal Pite and Jonathon Young’s five-star show Revisor; Where I Go (When I Can’t Be Where I Am), about living with chronic pain, conceived and directed by Rachel Bagshaw and written by Chris Thorpe; Corey Baker’s marvellous mini Swan Lake, performed in dancers’ baths; and Open Clasp theatre company’s Sugar, devised with women who are homeless, on probation or in prison. First, Do No Harm Sharon D Clarke has portrayed a long line of memorable characters but this is something else. In a new short play by Bernardine Evaristo, directed by Adrian Lester, Clarke speaks for the National Health Service and those who work for it, reflecting on the NHS’s past and future. As she proudly says: “I am one of the best things that has ever happened.” First, Do No Harm is part of a series celebrating the NHS entitled The Greatest Wealth, curated for the Old Vic by Lolita Chakrabarti. The Old Vic is also pioneering socially distanced live performances and rehearsed readings as well as archive recordings of past productions. Nine Lives Slam poet and playwright Zodwa Nyoni was born in Zimbabwe and grew up in Yorkshire. The locations are combined in her vivid 2016 monologue, in which Lladel Bryant plays Ishmael, a young gay Zimbabwean who flees homophobic violence in his home country and seeks asylum in the UK where he is dispersed to Leeds. Alex Chisholm’s hour-long production, available on YouTube, was recorded at the Arcola theatre in London. The Lord Chamberlain’s Men The all-male theatre company, known for touring open-air Shakespeare productions around the UK, has postponed its Macbeth until next year but shared two past productions on YouTube and on their website: The Tempest, staged in 2018, and A Midsummer Night’s Dream, presented last year to mark the company’s 15th birthday. They encourage you to recreate the spirit of their productions at home – “whether it is on a picnic blanket in your living room or under the stars wrapped up warm” – and share the results on social media. Richard II Quite simply one of 2019’s most celebrated and momentous stagings of Shakespeare. Adjoa Andoh stars as Richard and co-directs, with Lynette Linton, a superb cast entirely comprising women of colour including Shobna Gulati and Ayesha Dharker. An English history play vividly staged for today in the Globe’s candlelit Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, perfect for a play full of plotting. Available on YouTube. WeRNotVirus Directed by Jennifer Tang and Anthony Lau, this series of 10 short dramas by Moongate Productions and Omnibus theatre explores the pandemic of racism exacerbated by Covid-19 and enacted against Britain’s east and south-east Asian communities. With pieces by writers including Oladipo Agboluaje, Nemo Martin and Lucy Chau Lai-Tuen, it amounts to two hours of theatre on film that incorporates animation, poetry, music and dance. Some catchup videos are available on YouTube. Read the full review. Audible Amazon’s audiobook service includes a range of drama, such as Until the Flood by Dael Orlandersmith and a five-play collection from 2019’s Edinburgh fringe that includes Alan Harris’s NHS drama For All I Care. There’s also a chance to catch versions of memoirs you may have missed on stage, such as Vanessa Redgrave performing Joan Didion’s The Year of Magical Thinking and Maxine Peake’s version of Julia Leigh’s Avalanche: A Love Story. Plus: Emma Thompson and Sinead Matthews play Edith Sitwell and Marilyn Monroe respectively in a new play, The Dame and the Showgirl, by Simon Berry. Scenes for Survival The National Theatre of Scotland was among the first theatres to announce a lockdown programme of work responding to the pandemic. Its growing collection of short films is designed to offer audiences “hope and joy”. There’s Brian Cox as Ian Rankin’s Edinburgh detective John Rebus, Two Doors Down’s Jonathan Watson as a shipyard electrician suffering from exposure to asbestos, and Kate Dickie as brilliant as ever in a monologue by Jenni Fagan. The lineup of Scottish talent is extraordinary – Tam Dean Burn, Rona Munro and Douglas Henshall all contribute – and don’t miss Janey Godley’s two-hander with her adorable sausage dog. Read the full review. Matthew Bourne’s The Red Shoes One of the major dance productions cut short by the coronavirus crisis was Matthew Bourne’s tour of The Red Shoes, his rapturously received version of the Powell and Pressburger film. But a recording of the sumptuous stage performance made at Sadler’s Wells, starring Ashley Shaw in the role made famous by Moira Shearer, is available on BBC iPlayer. Bourne’s company New Adventures has also unveiled a charming 12-minute film version, performed by the cast from home – among children’s toys in their living rooms, on tables, in gardens and backyards, and in the kitchen. The costumes include football kits and, in one case, a couple of towels. Pass Over Antoinette Nwandu’s blistering, Beckettian play about police brutality was filmed at Chicago’s Steppenwolf theatre by Spike Lee for this 75-minute version, which crackles with humour, tension and tragedy. Lee skilfully weaves the audience, and the world outside the theatre, into a work that our critic Arifa Akbar gives five stars. Available on Amazon Prime. Read the full review. Unprecedented How’s this for a lineup? The cast includes Katherine Parkinson, Paterson Joseph and Denise Gough. The writers include James Graham, Jasmine Lee-Jones, Prasanna Puwanarajah and April De Angelis. And Ned Bennett, Blanche McIntyre, Ola Ince and Tinuke Craig are among the directors. Headlong and Century Films have assembled an extraordinarily talented gang for their 14 short films about lockdown life. On BBC iPlayer. Read the review. Sea Wall “She had us, both of us, absolutely round her finger …” From that first line, Andrew Scott will have you hooked in this half-hour monologue by Simon Stephens that captures truths about family life, art, nature and much else besides. Scott performed the play at the Bush in 2008 and it was a hot ticket when he reprised it at the Old Vic 10 years later. This version was shot in a single take in 2011. Directed by Stephens and Andrew Porter, it is available online to buy. Brace yourself. I Wish I Was a Mountain With wonder, wit and sophisticated storytelling, performance poet Toby Thompson creates a beautiful show for over-sevens. Thompson steps in and out of his version of Hermann Hesse’s fairytale Faldum, riffing with the young audience and spinning a handful of jazz LPs. I Wish I Was a Mountain embraces big questions about time and contentment. This is a short but profound show, directed by Lee Lyford, hatched by the Egg theatre’s Incubator development programme and cleverly designed by Anisha Fields. Read the full review. Lyric theatre in Belfast Belfast’s Lyric had to cancel its co-production of 1984 with Bruiser Theatre Company but instead launched the initiative New Speak: Re-imagined, in which Northern Irish talents including Amadan Ensemble, Dominic Montague and Katie Richardson respond to the lockdown crisis. They are being released in episodes on YouTube. The Lyric has also collaborated on a series of five-minute drama commissions for the series Splendid Isolation: Lockdown Drama, available on BBC iPlayer. Southwark Playhouse The London theatre has launched a Southwark Stayhouse streaming programme, available free until it reopens its doors.

Alexander Ekman Five works by the Swedish choreographer are on Marquee TV, including a new work for the Royal Swedish Ballet, Eskapist, which got a five-star review from Lyndsey Winship. On a vast stage, “Ekman offers a bombardment of fantastical images, realised with the help of Danish fashion designer Henrik Vibskov, who does a Mad Hatter’s couture party of eccentrically structured silhouettes.” Ekman’s other works to rent include Swan Lake and Midsummer Night’s Dream. Read the full review. What the Butler Saw Joe Orton’s final farce, completed in the summer of 1967 just before the playwright’s death, is a subversive satire about an irrational world, set in a psychiatrist’s consulting room.

The company have also opened up their archive to stream a selection of creations from the last 20 years, available on a pay-what-you-like basis. Now I’m Fine What better time is there to watch a “grand-scale experimental pop opera about keeping it together”? Ahamefule J Oluo’s innovative show, staged at Seattle’s Moore theatre in 2014, mixes standup-style routines with a mesmerising musical accompaniment and explores his experience of a rare autoimmune disease. It is one of many films, including Americana Kamikaze, that are available to rent or buy from On the Boards. Read the full review.

And here’s one unexpected tutor who really commands your attention: Jude Owusu, clad in a dirty bathrobe, with a pen behind his ear and a notepad dangling around his neck. Owusu is Cinna, the poet from Julius Caesar, in this spellbinding film of Tim Crouch’s monologue. Read the full review.

Funny Girl Showtunes don’t get much more defiant or rousing than Don’t Rain on My Parade. Sheridan Smith wards off the clouds with a gritty rendition as Fanny Bryce in this production of the classic musical at Manchester’s Palace theatre in 2017. It’s one of the many productions available to rent from Digital Theatre, whose offerings also include The Crucible starring Richard Armitage at the Old Vic in London, and Maxine Peake’s Hamlet at the Royal Exchange in Manchester. Fragments (Beckett by Brook) Is there a more fitting playwright for our current moment of isolation, uncertainty and endurance than Beckett? In this production, filmed at the marvellously atmospheric Bouffes du Nord in Paris in 2015, Peter Brook directs five Beckett shorts with a cast of three (Jos Houben, Marcello Magni and Kathryn Hunter). The production comprises Rough for Theatre I, Rockaby, Neither, Come and Go and Act Without Words II. Feel the rising panic and despair in Rockaby as the solitary, wide-eyed Hunter recounts a descent through long, lonely days. Palermo Palermo Even by Pina Bausch’s standards it’s an arresting opening: a huge wall collapses on stage and across the rubble comes Julie Shanahan, in high heels and a floral frock. After desperately commanding hugs from two suitors, she takes a seat and is pelted with rotten tomatoes. And so begins an epic patchwork of masochistic rituals, nightmares and games, blending the quotidian with the phenomenal, all inspired by the choreographer’s trip to Sicily. A rare chance to watch one of Bausch’s creations in full and for free online. Oscar Wilde season All four productions in Classic Spring’s starry Oscar Wilde season in the West End can be watched on the online service Marquee TV, which is offering a 14-day free trial.

Ghost Quartet If you missed its run at Soho’s Boulevard theatre, here’s a chance to savour Dave Malloy’s song cycle, filmed in New York in 2015. Alternately rousing and yearning, this is a gorgeous hymn to barflies, precious memories and the joys of being a ghost, told with a dash of Edgar Allan Poe and Thelonious Monk. It’s a glorious get-together of a show, as warming as the whiskey handed out to the audience – but you’ll have to pour your own. Le Patin Libre Think dance on ice and you’d imagine sequins and staggering TV celebrities, but the Canadian troupe, Le Patin Libre, has taken the art form into a new dimension. In their double bill, Vertical Influences, the skaters turned the rink into a mesmerising stage slowly decorated by the patterns cut by their blades. Watch the 20-minute short film Vertical on YouTube. The School for Wives Travel restrictions needn’t prevent you from enjoying international theatre online. Paris’s esteemed Odéon has released its 2018 production of Molière’s satirical 1662 comedy of manners and cuckoldry. Claude Duparfait stars as the foolish Arnolphe, and Stéphane Braunschweig directs.

The Wind in the Willows Julian Fellowes, George Stiles and Anthony Drewe teamed up to deliver a merry new version of Kenneth Grahame’s classic, staged at the London Palladium in 2017, with Rufus Hound wearing 50 shades of green as Mr Toad. It’s available to rent online, with the option to donate to help provide financial and emotional support to theatre workers. Girls Like That London’s Unicorn theatre has a world-class reputation for theatre for young audiences and its production of Evan Placey’s Girls Like That gripped the roomful of teenagers I watched it with in 2014. It’s online in full and offers a raw account of adolescent anxiety, slut-shaming and self-belief. In-your-face theatre that stays in your mind. John Leguizamo’s Latin History for Morons Self-isolation may mean that many of us will use living rooms to both teach children and watch theatre. An opportunity to combine the two can be found courtesy of the super-charismatic John Leguizamo – an inspirational tutor if ever there was – whose one-man Broadway show, Latin History for Morons, is on Netflix. Woke The subscription service LIVR enables you to catch up on theatre in 360-degree virtual reality.

The award-winning Patricia Gets Ready, written by Martha Watson Allpress, is also available from LIVR. Timpson: The Musical Two households, both alike in dignity … well, sort of. Our narrator, a talking portrait, lays our scene in Victorian London, and this musical comedy imagines the founding of the popular shoe-repair chain as a union between two companies, the Montashoes and the Keypulets. Watch Gigglemug Theatre’s show on their website. My Left Nut This is cheating as it’s a TV series, but BBC Three’s superb comedy drama is based on one of the most uproarious and affecting fringe theatre shows of recent years. It’s inspired by Michael Patrick’s own teenage experience of a medical condition that left his testicle “so big you could play it like a bongo”. Wince. Rosas Danst Rosas Love dance?

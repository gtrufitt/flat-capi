At the weekend, the UK prime minister said he would urge the G7 leaders to vaccinate the world against Covid by the end of next year.</p> <p>But is this feasible? That rather depends on your definition. No country will vaccinate every adult. Vaccinating enough to achieve herd immunity, which could be 60% or 70%, is the real aim. It is possible to achieve that by December 2023, say experts, but only if the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/g7\">G7</a> leading economies move immediately to make it happen.</p> <p>The Covax scheme under the UN umbrella should have been the route to vaccination for low-income countries. It was designed as their lifeline. Covax signed contracts with manufacturers to buy 2bn doses by the end of this year. But it is stymied. Its main supplier is the Serum Institute of India, which is now churning out vaccines in response to the terrible surge in domestic cases and deaths and will not be able to fulfil its contracts to Covax or individual countries before the end of the year.</p> <p>Dr Bruce Aylward, senior adviser to the director general of the World Health Organization, who is heavily involved in the vaccine efforts, said: “This is where the UK becomes really important and the G7, because right now we’ve got this gap of death. In June, July, August, September, there’s no vaccine out there for love nor money, in terms of being able to procure it.”</p> <p><strong>Read more of Sarah Boseley’s analysis here: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/jun/08/can-we-vaccinate-the-world-against-covid-by-the-end-of-2022\">Can we vaccinate the world against Covid by the end of 2022?</a></strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/jun/08/can-we-vaccinate-the-world-against-covid-by-the-end-of-2022\">Can we vaccinate the world against Covid by the end of 2022?</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-60bf09cc8f08336d75f063b9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-06-08T06:14:13.214Z\">7.14am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The president of the <strong>Tokyo 2020</strong> organising committee, <strong>Seiko Hashimoto,</strong> is speaking this morning, and she is setting out some of the procedures that will be undertaken to try to keep the games safe.</p> <p>So far, she’s said that media will not be able to use shared accommodation, and that the media will be GPS-tracked to ensure they don’t go into unauthorised areas.

That would make it the first country to offer jabs to young children. “In recent days, the Sinovac vaccine was approved for emergency use in three- to 17-year-olds,” the spokesperson said. But they did not confirm when the young children would be able to start receiving the shots, saying the schedule for the rollout will be decided by the National Health Commission “according to China’s current epidemic prevention and control needs and vaccine supply”. The company has completed early phase trials of the vaccine in children and adolescents, with results to be published shortly in the Lancet scientific journal, the spokesperson added. State broadcaster CCTV reported over the weekend that an unnamed official in the State Council’s epidemic response task force had said vaccines had been approved for children, and “the safety and effectiveness” had been proven. A spokesperson for China’s other major vaccine, Sinopharm, said that experts had demonstrated the effectiveness of its vaccine in children, but didn’t confirm whether it had been approved for use. A quick one from Reuters: Russia reported 9,977 new Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, including 3,817 in Moscow. The government coronavirus task force also said that 379 people had died of coronavirus-related causes in the last 24 hours, pushing the official death toll to 124,496. That’s far fewer than the 270,000 that the state statistics service says had died from Covid-19 and related causes from April 2020 to April 2021. Britain ignored scientific advice and instead took a political decision when it failed to put Malta on its list of safe travel destinations, Malta Foreign Minister Evarist Bartolo said. Britons traditionally account for a third of all arrivals on the small Mediterranean island, and opposition politicians criticised the government for failing to convince London that Malta was a safe tourist destination. Britain last week revised its so-called “green list” of countries, that do not require quarantine on return, choosing not to put any new country on it, while removing Portugal. But Bartolo said the British government did not want its nationals to go abroad because of concerns over growing coronavirus cases at home. “The British government is ignoring scientific advice. It has taken a political decision not to allow travel anywhere, despite the pressure it faces from airlines, tourism operators and the people in general,” he wrote on Facebook. Chris Scicluna reports from Valetta for Reuters that Malta on Monday reported no new Covid-19 cases for the first time in 11 months. Half of its adult population has been fully vaccinated and 75% have received a first dose of a vaccine - the highest rate within the European Union. Dr Nikki Kanani, director of primary care at NHS England, said that vaccine confidence in younger people had increased in the UK. Speaking as over-25s were invited to book their Covid-19 jabs, PA report Dr Kanani told BBC Breakfast: “We’re still seeing great uptake and we are definitely seeing younger people coming in and asking more questions, which is absolutely fine. “More than four in five 40 to 49-year-olds have had their first dose and two-thirds of 30 to 39-year-olds have already had theirs, and that is still going to increase, of course, as people come forward, so uptake remains high. “We had additional polling over the weekend that shows that the confidence in the vaccine has increased by a fifth - by 20% - in those under-40s. “What’s really important as we go into the younger categories is really appealing to people in their own communities and what our teams have done so well is reflect what a community needs locally - whether that’s setting up pop-up vaccination centres in Gurudwaras or temples, or in shopping malls or at workplaces, that has been critical to making sure that people feel confident to take up the vaccine when they’re asked to do so.” Overnight saw a rush to travel back to the UK from Portugal, as travellers had until 4am to return to avoid having to quarantine for 10 days after the country was moved from the “green” list to the “amber” list, without being placed on a watchlist first. The UK’s environment minister has been getting a tough ride on the media morning round in the UK – being asked whether the travel rules, and government advice, have to be this complicated, and why there was so little warning of the change of status. Eustace said “Our advice has always been that you should not travel to countries on the amber list.” The Gaby Hinsliff column today asks the question before Britain vaccinates children, should it vaccinate the world? She writes: Personally I was thrilled to get my vaccine and would be more than happy for my son to have it, but what brought me up short was the question I saw posed recently by the epidemiologist Adam Kucharski: if rich countries have enough vaccine left to jab children at incredibly low risk of serious illness and death, why aren’t they offering it to poorer countries where people are dying for lack of it? Shouldn’t we be taking more seriously the threat not just of humanitarian crises, but of a more resistant variant emerging in some place where the virus is currently raging out of control, fatally undermining the vaccines that remain our only real route to freedom? Only 2% of sub-Saharan Africa has had a first dose. Thailand, engulfed by a severe outbreak, is only just beginning mass vaccinations. Even if the G7 summit agrees this week to invest billions in ramping up vaccine production for poorer countries – as a group of former world leaders led by Gordon Brown wants – that takes months to come on stream. If Britain doesn’t want to seal its borders – and nothing in ministers’ confused approach to foreign holidays suggests they do – then digging an ever-stronger domestic firebreak against the more contagious Delta variant we have just imported from India won’t be enough. We’re going to need a global firebreak against something worse evolving too, and fast. Read more here: Gaby Hinsliff – Before Britain vaccinates children, should it vaccinate the world? Helen Davidson reports from Taipei: Some tentative good news from Taiwan, with a second consecutive day of cases in the 200s and no new cases from backlogged test results. As long as results are not down because of lower weekend testing, the decline is a positive sign in Taiwan’s battle against its worst outbreak of the pandemic. However with about 8,000 cases still active, fatalities have not stopped and authorities reported another 22 deaths. The new cases were mostly in New Taipei city, with 123 recorded. Another 54 were reported from the capital Taipei, while 16 were found in Miaoli where there are growing concerns over an outbreak among employees from three factories which has so far infected 211 people. Health and welfare minister, Chen Chih-shung, said the rate of positive cases in New Taipei was dropping but there was no room yet to relax current restrictions. He urged people not to travel during an upcoming long weekend and dragon-boat festival, which authorities have not cancelled. Vaccine supplies took another hit, with authorities saying expected shipments of AstraZeneca and from Covax had been delayed by about a month. Half of the 150,000 recently obtained Moderna vaccines have been allocated to frontline medical staff. China’s vaccination numbers are never low. Official figures reported by Reuters say that the nation administered about 16.3 million doses of vaccine on 7 June, bringing the total number administered to 794m. In India, the state of Uttar Pradesh has announced that it will end some Covid restrictions. The Hindustan Times reports this morning: The Uttar Pradesh government on Tuesday gave relaxations in ‘corona curfew’ in all 75 districts of the state. According to guidelines announced by the state government, districts with less than 600 active cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) can get relaxations. A state government spokesperson said that there will be relaxation in coronavirus curfew in all the districts of the state from Wednesday onwards, from 7am to 7pm, for five days. However, the night curfew – 7pm to 7am and weekend curfew (for entire day) – will continue. The UK’s environment secretary George Eustace – a man who clearly isn’t in the position where he hasn’t seen family and loved ones abroad for over a year due to travel bans – has told Sky News this morning: “I have no intention of travelling or going on a holiday abroad this summer.” He was being pressed by newly returned presenter Kay Burley on the scramble for flights back from Portugal after it was moved from the “green list” to the “amber list” with very little warning. PA Media quotes him saying: Our advice has been don’t travel unless it’s absolutely necessary. Obviously we had hoped, with these three categories that we had, we had hoped that situation would be improving in other parts of the world, that we’d be able to progressively add other countries to the green list. Sadly, that’s not the situation, we do have this new variant of concern first identified in India that is now cropping up in other countries, and we’ve just got to take a very cautious approach. Asked about the UK government’s delay in shutting down travel from India, he said “India was added as soon as we saw a spike in rates and as soon as we saw there was a reason to”, denying that the delay had been political. At the time Indian case numbers were rising and the government took no action, UK prime minister Boris Johnson had been planning to visit India in his first major trip abroad since the pandemic, with the aim of pushing a post-Brexit UK-India trade deal. Unicef has urged rich members of the G7 to start donating vaccines to poor countries now, instead of waiting to donate leftovers all at once, saying many nations don’t have capacity to roll out huge amounts in one go. Unicef’s vaccine lead Lily Caprani told BBC Newsnight governments in the UK and other G7 nations “need to donate their doses to those low income countries now, while still vaccinating their populations at home.” “Low income countries need a steady supply that they can get off the tarmac and into the arms of health care workers... The unintended consequence of saving all these vaccines up to Christmas time is that countries won’t be able to absorb them and roll them out and therefore they could end up going to waste. We could see millions of doses of vaccines not used and expiring, and that will be a tragedy.” The World Health Organization has also called on Covid-19 vaccine manufacturers to give the Covax scheme first refusal on new doses, or commit half of their volumes to the global jab equity scheme. Our health editor Sarah Boseley asks the question this morning: Can we vaccinate the world against Covid by the end of 2022? As ambitious declarations go – even for Boris Johnson – it was a big one. At the weekend, the UK prime minister said he would urge the G7 leaders to vaccinate the world against Covid by the end of next year. But is this feasible? That rather depends on your definition. No country will vaccinate every adult. Vaccinating enough to achieve herd immunity, which could be 60% or 70%, is the real aim. It is possible to achieve that by December 2023, say experts, but only if the G7 leading economies move immediately to make it happen. The Covax scheme under the UN umbrella should have been the route to vaccination for low-income countries. It was designed as their lifeline. Covax signed contracts with manufacturers to buy 2bn doses by the end of this year. But it is stymied. Its main supplier is the Serum Institute of India, which is now churning out vaccines in response to the terrible surge in domestic cases and deaths and will not be able to fulfil its contracts to Covax or individual countries before the end of the year. Dr Bruce Aylward, senior adviser to the director general of the World Health Organization, who is heavily involved in the vaccine efforts, said: “This is where the UK becomes really important and the G7, because right now we’ve got this gap of death. In June, July, August, September, there’s no vaccine out there for love nor money, in terms of being able to procure it.” Read more of Sarah Boseley’s analysis here: Can we vaccinate the world against Covid by the end of 2022? The president of the Tokyo 2020 organising committee, Seiko Hashimoto, is speaking this morning, and she is setting out some of the procedures that will be undertaken to try to keep the games safe. So far, she’s said that media will not be able to use shared accommodation, and that the media will be GPS-tracked to ensure they don’t go into unauthorised areas. She has also said that they expect to start vaccinating Olympics-related staff by mid-June. Reuters note that foreign spectators have already been banned, and organisers are expected to make a decision late this month on domestic spectators. Toshiaki Endo, the vice-president of the Tokyo organising committee, has previously suggested to Reuters some spectators could be allowed into venues, although he personally preferred a total ban to calm persistent public opposition to the Games. On the downside, I just saw this tweet today, and now I can’t stop thinking about it either… Good morning, it is Martin Belam here in London taking over today’s blog. The biggest news in England is the extension of vaccinations to those aged 25 and over this morning. If you fall into that category you can book your shot at the NHS England site here. Northern Ireland has already been offering vaccines to anybody over 18, you can find out more here. Those in Scotland and Wales can find out the latest information for them here: NHS Scotland Gov.wales Reuters: New Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Tuesday that she would get her first Covid-19 shot at the end of next week, as the country prepared to receive another 1 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine. “For me, it’s been important that I allow those in the most at risk group... to be prioritised,” Ardern said in a news conference. “I’m choosing to be vaccinated at this point in order to play my role in demonstrating that I consider it to be absolutely safe and also really critical to keep others safe,” she said. China today pledged further assistance to Southeast Asian nations in battling the pandemic, the Associated Press reports. The country’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, told his Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) counterparts that China had already delivered 100 million doses of vaccine to Asean nations along with other materials and technical help. Wang said China would “urgently implement” the China-Asean Public Health Cooperation Initiative, continue to support the Asean Emergency Medical Materials Reserve and strengthen regional public health capacity-building. “China will work with Asean to overcome the outbreak as soon as possible,” Wang told a meeting of ministers. He said the sides should explore establishing an expert panel to strengthen cooperation throughout the vaccine process, from research to use, and work to build production and distribution centres to help make vaccines affordable and accessible in the region. Though Covid-19 was first detected in China in late 2019, the nation has largely stamped out domestic transmission, although it has been accused of insufficient transparency or even seeking to conceal the origins of the pandemic. Beijing has been building influence with Asean, despite frictions with some members of the bloc over competing territorial claims in the South China Sea. Welcome to another day of the pandemic, and our continuing global coverage of the latest developments. Below are some of the key updates from the last day. Canada is preparing to ease birder restrictions for vaccinated travellers, Bloomberg reports. A top Japanese virologist and government adviser has warned of the risks of spreading infections during the Tokyo Olympics. Australia’s state of Victoria is on track to ease restrictions on residents, currently in a lockdown to deal with an outbreak of the Delta variant, authorities said. India’s government will provide free vaccinations for all adults, Prime Minister Narendra Modi says, as the capital New Delhi and financial hub Mumbai ease lockdowns on falling infection levels. A new coronavirus antibody drug appears to show promise in mouse studies, according to a study published in Nature. The Czech Republic has announced it will reopen its borders to EU and Serbian citizens on June 21. Just days before the start of the Euros, Spain’s football players and staff have returned negative Covid-19 tests after captain Sergio Busquets had to go home and quarantine. There was “delight across Ireland” as the country reopened pubs, restaurants and leisure facilities. Central Park is to host an “all-star” concert in August to mark New York’s comeback after the pandemic. New York governor Andrew Cuomo has announced that the state’s remaining coronavirus restrictions will be lifted when 70% of residents have had at least one vaccine dose.","charCount":"17291","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a> (now) and <a

BAT now expects revenue growth guidance of above 5% for 2021, as it pushes these ‘new category’ products such as Vuse, Velo and Glo. Jack Bowles, chief executive, said: “We added +1.4 million non-combustible product consumers in Q1, to reach a total of 14.9 million. “We are growing New Categories at pace, encouraging more smokers to switch to scientifically substantiated reduced-risk alternatives.” Back in February, my colleagues Rob Davies and Matthew Chapman reported how BAT had launched a £1bn campaign using social media and popular influencers to promote its e-cigarettes, vapes and pouches. They explained: Critics say that such viral videos, even if they aren’t paid-for adverts, are the consequence of a global marketing push designed to offset dwindling cigarette consumption by recruiting the nicotine consumers of the future. BAT has embarked on a £1bn campaign that harnesses the popular appeal of social media influencers, pop stars and sporting events. According to a wide-ranging report by The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, it has also attracted younger adults, non-smokers and even reached the eyes of children. Shares in UK insurance firm Aviva have jumped 3.6%, after activist investor Cevian took a 5% stake - and started pressing for change. Cevian, Europe’s biggest activist investor, is pushing for Aviva to make deeper cost cuts, and return £5bn to investors following recent asset sales. Christer Gardell, Cevian’s co-founder, says: “Aviva has been poorly managed for many years, and its high-quality core businesses have been held back by high costs and a series of bad strategic decisions.” Shares in Aviva have gained 14.7p to 425p this morning, their highest since January 2020, just before the pandemic. Aviva has been selling off international assets since CEO Amanda Blanc took the helm last summer, and pledged to focus on larger businesses in the UK, Ireland and Canada. But Cevian argues that Aviva’s share price could climb to more than £8 within three years, if it returned excess capital to shareholders through dividends or buybacks. The FT has more details... Aviva has promised substantial returns and cost reductions as central planks of its strategy shift under Blanc, who has told investors that her mantra is to move quickly. However, Cevian wants a specific return of £5bn in dividends or buybacks of capital that the insurer has in excess of regulatory requirements The activist fund also believes that the cost-cutting can go further, calling for reductions of more than £500m from Aviva’s annual cost base by 2023, compared with the management’s target of £300m. It is also pushing for a leaner management structure, according to a person familiar with the matter. In London, stocks have opened a little higher, with the FTSE 100 up 15 points or 0.2% to 7092 points. Asset manager Intermediate Capital Group are the top riser, surging 6.7%, after reporting record profits, and a 19% jump in third-party assets under management amid the recovery in markets over the last year. But oil producer Royal Dutch Shell are down 1.3%, following a drop in the oil price this morning, while steelmaker Evraz is down 1.5%. Brent crude has dipped 0.5% to $71 per barrel, after China’s crude oil imports dropped by almost 15% in May - suggesting weaker demand. Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizhuo Securities, said: “Chinese oil imports at a five-month low ... would tend to confirm weakness in the Asia market.” On a brighter note, Japan’s economy shrank by less than first feared in the January-March quarter. Q1 GDP was revised up today, to show an annualised contraction of 3.9% (so almost 1% smaller on a quarterly basis). That’s up from a preliminary reading of a 5.1% contraction (or -1.3% q/q). Government spending and corporate investment fell less than first estimated, although household spending fell slightly more. Although the upgrade is welcome, it still leaves Japan half-way into recession, and breaks its recovery in the second half of 2020. A lack of semiconductors, timber and other intermediate goods weighed on German industrial output, says Reuters: The weaker than expected industrial figures suggest that the German economy will have to rely on household spending to support a still-fragile recovery from the coronavirus crisis. “Such a combination is unparalleled: Order books in industry are well filled and production is falling,” VP Bank economist Thomas Gitzel said, adding that the supply problems with semiconductors were pushing down output in the car industry. So despite well-filled order books, manufacturing will only make a limited contribution to overall economic growth in the second quarter, Gitzel said. The week-long blockage of the Suez Canal by the Ever Given in March contributed to the supply chain problems hitting German firms in April, suggests Carsten Brzeski of ING. He writes that April’s disappointing drop in industrial production suggests the rebound of the German economy in Q2 has ‘started with shaky knees’: The disappointing start to the second quarter suggests that supply chain disruptions, like the blockage of the Suez Canal in April or the ongoing semiconductor delivery problems, have not left German industry unscathed. However despite today’s disappointment, the industrial outlook remains bright. Brzeski adds that capacity issues and the lack of qualified workers could soon return as the most pressing hurdles to growth, as lack of demand isn’t a problem. Destatis also reports that German construction output fell by 4.3% in April -- suggesting that shortages of building materials might be weighing on the sector. Energy production jumped by 6.0%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Output at German factories has fallen unexpectedly, as supply chain bottlenecks and shortages of key parts and materials such as computer chips threaten to undermine the recovery. German industrial production fell by 1.0% in April, the Federal Statistics Office reports this morning. That’s shy of forecasts of a 0.5% rise, as Europe’s largest economy looked to recover from its contraction earlier this year. Production of consumer goods slumped by 3.3% - even though some households are expected to be spending heavily this summer as lockdowns restriction are lifted. Production of intermediate goods (items used in final products) fell 0.2%, while production of heavy duty capital goods decreased by 0.1%. March’s growth was revised down too, from +2.5% to +2.2%. It means production at German factories is still 5.6% below its pre-pandemic levels, despite the pick-up in the global economy this year. Factory bosses have been warning of shortages of semiconductors, plastics, rubber and metals, with suppliers hiking prices in response. These shortfalls are threatening to undermine the recovery from last year’s economic slump, and are also pushing prices higher as firms try to recoup their costs. Yesterday we learned that German factory orders fell in April, indicating that the problems may last for some time. Semiconductor shortages are a particular problem, which has already hit car production this year. Those shortages are expected to run into next year, as ramping up chip fabrication plants takes time. Tesla is reportedly considering buying its own chip plant, to guarantee supplies. Bosch, Europe’s largest auto supplier, says car manufacturers must put “money on the table” and make a “rock solid” commitment to orders, Bosch board member Harald Krüger told the Financial Times. “The only way to get out of [the recent crisis] is to have a different level of commitment” Bosch opened a €1bn semiconductor plant in Dresden yesterday, to produce chips for its power tools in July, before beginning production on automotive chips in September. That might help to ease the chip shortage, though as Krüger says.... “Money needs to be put on the table and actually parts have to be bought. “The commitment needs to be rock solid that those parts will be bought. It can’t be: ‘Maybe I [will] buy them, prepare for it, and maybe not.’ This doesn’t work.” More here: Carmakers must ‘put money on table’ to avoid repeat of chip crisis The agenda 8.30am BST: Bank of England to publish details of its 2021 climate change stress test 10am BST: ZEW index of German economic sentiment 10am BST: Eurozone Q1 GDP and employment figures (final estimate) 11am BST: US NFIB business optimism index 1.30pm BST: US trade balance for April 3pm BST: US JOLTS index of job openings","charCount":"8766","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/graemewearden\">Graeme Wearden</a>"},{"headline":"Australia news live: SA and WA expand vaccine eligibility as Victoria finds source of Delta Covid outbreak","standfirst":"<p>Victoria reports two new coronavirus cases, both linked to current outbreaks, as Delta variant traced to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2021/jun/08/australia-news-covid-victoria-morrison-biloela-lockdown-nsw?page=with:block-60bebb128f0837b8708e09ff#block-60bebb128f0837b8708e09ff\">returned traveller</a>; Western Australia opens vaccinations <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2021/jun/08/australia-news-covid-victoria-morrison-biloela-lockdown-nsw?page=with:block-60bef6f48f08336d75f062ed#block-60bef6f48f08336d75f062ed\">to over-30s</a>; South Australia <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2021/jun/08/australia-news-covid-victoria-morrison-biloela-lockdown-nsw?page=with:block-60beef258f0837b8708e0bca#block-60beef258f0837b8708e0bca\">expands</a> vaccine rollout</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/jun/08/essential-poll-support-for-coalitions-covid-handling-lowest-since-outbreak-began\">Support for Coalition’s Covid handling lowest since outbreak began</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/jun/08/nonsense-victorian-government-demands-apology-after-liberals-question-dan-andrews-injury\">‘Nonsense’: Victorian government demands apology after Liberals question Dan Andrews’ injury</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2021/jun/08/covid-19-vaccine-rollout-australia-coronavirus-vaccination-progress-updates-tracker-victoria-nsw-queensland-qld-daily-live-data-stats-updates-total-numbers-distribution-schedule-tracking-new-cases-today\">Australia’s vaccine rollout numbers: progress state-by-state</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/jun/08/covid-19-list-melbourne-public-exposure-sites-hotspots-victoria-venues-case-location-alerts-metro-regional-vic-coronavirus-cases-outbreak-locations\">Victoria Covid-19 exposure sites</a>; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/jun/08/covid-19-list-nsw-public-exposure-sites-hotspots-goulburn-jervis-bay-hyams-beach-gundagai-venues-case-location-alerts-sydney-regional-coronavirus-cases-outbreak-locations\">NSW exposure sites</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/jun/08/melbourne-lockdown-covid-victoria-restrictions-coronavirus-rules-covid19-explained-10km-radius-masks-compulsory-exercising-home-gatherings-what-you-need-to-know\">Victoria’s lockdown restrictions explained</a></li></ul>","trailText":"Follow latest updates","byline":"Luke Henriques-Gomes (now) and Matilda Boseley (earlier)","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ea4d7e45f45e3009d7c897cfce86784fd7cc2861\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea4d7e45f45e3009d7c897cfce86784fd7cc2861/0_0_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Covid health sign in Melbourne amid near-deserted streets during lockdown\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Covid health sign in Melbourne amid near-deserted streets on the city’s 12th day of lockdown on Tuesday.

detaining him for more than two years.</p> <p>The federal court on Monday found the man, identified only by the pseudonym MZZHL, had been unlawfully detained by the commonwealth from March 2019 until May this year, because the <strong>Department of Home Affairs </strong>was not pursuing the purpose of his detention, which was “removing him from Australia”, during that time.</p> <p>The Department of Home Affairs did not initially comment on the case, and it has not indicated if it will appeal against the judgment. </p> <p>However, today a spokesperson told the Guardian it was “aware of the judgment handed down” and “is considering the implications of this judgment”. </p> <p>The spokesperson did not clarify whether the department could now reassess others currently in detention or similar cases, but <strong>Alison Battisson</strong>, director principal of the group Human Rights for All, which ran the case, believes the judgment could set a precedent for similar cases. </p> <p>She said that was because unlike other detention cases before the high court, this case focused on the purpose of detention.<br></p> <p>Battisson told the Guardian:</p> <blockquote

Here’s a look at today’s main stories. Victoria recorded two local cases, as authorities said the state was “on track” for an easing of restrictions by Friday. However, it was also revealed that the Delta variant case has been tracked to back to Victoria’s hotel quarantine program, in the latest leak from the system. The NSW government announced plans for a new mass vaccination hub. Western Australia said it would open its vaccine program to people 30 years old and above, while South Australia also expanded its rollout. The federal government faced criticism for the treatment of a three-year-old girl from the Biloela family who was medically airlifted from Christmas Island to Perth. The federal government said it had granted 90 visas to Afghan interpreters who worked with the Australian defence force, amid growing concerns for their safety. In state politics, Victoria’s acting premier said the Liberal opposition should be ashamed of attacks it launched against Daniel Andrews, who remains on sick leave. And NSW Labor appointed Prue Car as deputy leader. Stay safe and we’ll see you tomorrow. Samantha Maiden of news.com.au reports here that the federal government has issued a military sociologist with a legal demand to prove her new book doesn’t pose a national security risk. The reported demand related to Blood Lust, Trust and Blame, the new book by Samantha Crompvoets, whose landmark report sparked a major investigation into alleged war crimes by Australian soldiers. I should note we have not independently confirmed this, but it seems like a pretty remarkable development. Former AFL club executive Kelly Ryan is the new boss of Netball Australia, reports AAP. Ryan replaces Marne Fechner, who stepped down late last year, with Ron Steiner holding the chief executive role on an interim basis for the past eight months. With a marketing background, Ryan comes to Netball Australia after holding positions with the Gold Coast and Western Bulldogs AFL clubs and, most recently, with Marvel Stadium. NA chair Marina Go said Ryan had been chosen from a strong field of candidates. Kelly comes to netball at a pivotal time in our sport’s development. While her experience and track record of leadership is impeccable, it is her drive and strategic ambition for netball that most excites us. Ryan said she was thrilled to lead netball at such an important time of change and growth and would look to ensure it remained the leading sport for women. I am honoured to be selected to lead netball at such an important time. Here’s a market update at the close of play, from AAP. A record high for the Australian share market soon gave way to timid trading as investors wait for key gauges of inflation in China and the US. The ASX200 rose to a lofty 7315.6 points in the first hour of trade but was little changed for most of the day. Investors are looking forward to China’s consumer and producer price indices prior to US inflation data this week. The figures should show whether inflation is soaring as major economies recover from the coronavirus pandemic. The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index closed higher by 10.7 points, or 0.15%, to 7292.6 on Tuesday. This was three points shy of its record closing level. The All Ordinaries was up by 10.7 points, or 0.14%, to 7542.3. The Australian dollar was buying US77.46c at 1623 AEST, higher from US77.34c at Monday’s close. There is a small update to the story we reported yesterday that the Australian government was ordered to pay an Iraqi asylum seeker $350,000 in damages for unlawfully detaining him for more than two years. The federal court on Monday found the man, identified only by the pseudonym MZZHL, had been unlawfully detained by the commonwealth from March 2019 until May this year, because the Department of Home Affairs was not pursuing the purpose of his detention, which was “removing him from Australia”, during that time. The Department of Home Affairs did not initially comment on the case, and it has not indicated if it will appeal against the judgment. However, today a spokesperson told the Guardian it was “aware of the judgment handed down” and “is considering the implications of this judgment”. The spokesperson did not clarify whether the department could now reassess others currently in detention or similar cases, but Alison Battisson, director principal of the group Human Rights for All, which ran the case, believes the judgment could set a precedent for similar cases. She said that was because unlike other detention cases before the high court, this case focused on the purpose of detention. Battisson told the Guardian: This decision says if you are not pursuing the purpose of detention, then the detention is no longer lawful, and it doesn’t matter if they have a visa or not. You can read more: The Victorian state Liberal frontbencher Tim Smith says he thinks chief health officer Brett Sutton’s judgment could be “impaired” because of the difficulties the health system faced last year. Smith has just told ABC Radio Melbourne that Sutton’s view of issues such as the need for restrictions in response to outbreaks was much more pessimistic than NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant. Smith says: I think we need a fresh pair of eyes. I think he is needlessly looking at this from a very negative perspective. I think having a more objective and balanced approach might be in the state’s best interest. Smith has been one of the most vocal critics of the Victorian Labor government, but his latest criticism of Sutton – a public health official rather than a politician – is particularly strident. Just heartbreaking. The Department of Health says 127,564 vaccine doses were administered in the past 24 hours. The national total is at 5,203,977 doses. The mother of a man who acquired unexplained bruises while living in disability housing was told to make a freedom of information request to see the subsequent report, an inquiry has been told. Adelaide woman Karen Rogers gave evidence at a hearing of the disability royal commission on Tuesday about two separate occasions when she discovered bruises on her son Daniel, reports AAP. The most serious occurred in February 2019 when a support worker phoned to say Daniel had a “large bruise on his back”, Rogers told the commissioners. A doctor recommended he go to hospital to check that the bruise, stretching from his spine to his kidney, was not caused by internal bleeding. That was found not to be the case, and in the days that followed Rogers decided Daniel should stay with her and her husband. Rogers said: Daniel seemed to be traumatised, he was very unsettled at night and if we mentioned [the disability home] in a conversation, he became very distressed and he would start hitting himself in the head. An official at the Department of Human Services (DHS) advised her to make a complaint to police, who launched an investigation. Daniel was aged 40 and lived with autism, epilepsy and intellectual disability, the hearing was told. He had limited speech and was unable to give a police statement. After officers visited his former home and interviewed staff, police advised they could not take the matter further and the DHS began its own investigation, the hearing was told. The department’s incident management unit never sought to interview Rogers or her son, Rogers said. More than a year after the bruises were discovered, she sought a meeting with the unit’s director, Stewart Dodd. Rogers told the hearing: Stewart told me the DHS investigation was inconclusive and he was unable to provide a copy of the report to me. Stewart said if I wanted to see a copy of the report, I would need to make a freedom of information application. Staff believed the injury occurred outside the home, but no one could come to a determination, the department’s Wayne Cunningham told the hearing. Daniel was now “very happy” after a period of readjustment, but still reacted negatively to anything to do with the disability home, Rogers said. I still feel there are answers out there and I still would like to know what happened. I guess we’re never going to know. The disability royal commission is holding a week-long hearing in Adelaide. Over on the ABC, Patricia Karvelas asked Liberal MP Dave Sharma if he was comfortable with the decision to separate the youngest daughter of the Tamil family fighting deportation on Christmas Island from her father. Tharunicaa, who is three, has been medically airlifted to Perth with her mother, but her father and sibling have remain on Christmas Island. Sharma says: I’ve got a lot of sympathy for her. I wasn’t part of that decision. I’d like to see families kept together wherever possible, including seeking medical treatment, but without knowing particular circumstances, that is all I can say, as a matter of principle. Sharma repeated that he had “sympathy” for the family but noted he was not the minister. Pressed, he would not say that the minister, Karen Andrews, should use her ministerial discretion to allow them to stay in Australia. I don’t know them personally but we are a country that is governed by laws, not the individual ministers and make systems and processes. But Labor MP Peter Khalil said ministers had used this discretion many times. He said: This argument the government puts up about this opening up the back door is utterly ridiculous. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, has been out spruiking the virtues of Australia to international investors in a pre-recorded interview with ratings agency Fitch, released this morning. Frydenberg’s message could be boiled down to: please don’t take away our AAA rating (Fitch has given Australia the top rating but has slapped a negative outlook on it). Asked about the slow vaccine rollout, Frydenberg passed up the opportunity to give a target date by when the Australian population will be jabbed to the point of herd immunity. “It’s definitely gaining pace,” he said, pointing to Australia’s ability to make the AstraZeneca vaccine at CSL’s factory. We are not putting a specific date on it. He said the budget contained an “assumption” that the vaccine would be available to anyone who wanted it by the end of the year, but this was not a policy position. As the interview was for an international audience, the usual attacks on Victoria were also muted, with Frydenberg confining himself to holding out NSW as an example of a state that had dealt with outbreaks without locking down. Nor are skyrocketing house prices a problem, Frydenberg told potential bond investors, thanks to record low interest rates. Higher house prices also lead to people spending more, he said. People suddenly start feeling the wealth effect, and that’s quite a good thing for the economy at large. I’m pleased when housing prices are going up rather than going down. So that’s all right then. On the calls for Afghan interpreters and local staff to be granted visas, Labor says the government should fast-track the process. It comes amid reports of direct threats against their safety by the Taliban, and with the government saying it has just granted 90 visas for Afghans who worked with the Australian defence force. The opposition’s foreign affairs spokeswoman, Penny Wong says: Australia has a duty of care to these Afghan nationals who were vital to the Australian government operations over 20 years. They now face threats from the Taliban and we have a moral obligation to act urgently to get them to safety. Brendan O’Connor, Labor’s defence spokesman, said: In many cases, these interpreters wore Australian uniforms and helped keep our troops and diplomats safe, at great risk to themselves. Kristina Keneally, the opposition’s home affairs spokeswoman, said: Home affairs minister Karen Andrews needs to get this done. These staff are facing real risks to their safety now, they can’t afford a year-long wait for a visa. My colleague Ben Doherty has been watching the Ben Roberts-Smith defamation trial. The Morrison government says Australia has granted an extra 90 visas to Afghan nationals who have worked alongside Australia since the beginning of May. Guardian Australia understands officials are now working with those nationals to assist them getting on to commercial flights to Australia in the near future. It comes amid growing calls for Australia to assist Afghan nationals, such as interpreters and guards, who now face retribution from the Taliban for their work alongside Australia. SBS reported this afternoon that dozens of Afghans who worked alongside the Australian defence force and their families are preparing to evacuate to Australia in the coming weeks. When contacted for confirmation, a spokesperson for immigration minister, Alex Hawke, told Guardian Australia the government had granted about 90 additional visas to locally engaged staff since the start of May. Together with family members, that adds 200 to the total number Afghan nationals who have been resettled in Australia since this program for locally engaged workers began in 2013. Previously we knew of 1,200 such resettlements since the scheme began. The Morrison government has announced the first $50m in grants from its new carbon capture, use and storage fund (CCS), including giving up to $15m to gas company Santos and $4m to an existing coal-fired power plant. The funding is drawn from a promised $263.7m for the controversial technology announced in this year’s federal budget. Though long promised as a means to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, CCS has not proven commercially viable in reducing emissions from coal power and its use has been restricted to a few industrial projects. Several of those are in enhanced oil recovery – the CO2 is injected underground as a means to get access to more fossil fuels. Two of the projects announced as receiving funding on Tuesday involve capturing CO2 from fossil fuel developments and storing them underground. Three plan to use the captured CO2 in product development, rather than store it underground. The sixth is for a “direct-air capture and storage” pilot that is intended to draw CO2 from the atmosphere and bury it underground. The emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, said there had been “overwhelming demand” for the funding, with the government having received applications to support $1.2bn of investment. He said it was “further proof of the viability and importance of carbon capture technologies”. The projects we have supported through this program include a number of exciting, Australian-first technology demonstrations. The six developments are: Up to $15m for Santos’s Moomba liquifeid natural gas project in the Cooper Basin, South Australia. The company says it is expected to store 1.7m tonnes of CO2 a year. Up to $14.6m for Mineral Carbonation International to help build a mobile demonstration plant on Kooragang Island, NSW, that uses CO2 to produce manufacturing and construction materials, such as concrete, plasterboard and fire-retardant materials. Up to $9m for Energy Developments Pty Ltd to use CO2 emitted from the production of biomethane at landfill sites in cement carbonation curing. Up to $5m for Carbon Transport and Storage Company to demonstrate the viability of CCS at a coal-fired power station in Queensland and support the development of a geological storage basin in the Surat Basin. Up to $4m for Corporate Carbon Advisory Pty Ltd for Australia’s first demonstration of a direct-air-capture and storage project to geologically sequester CO2 in an existing injection well in Moomba, South Australia. Up to $2.4m for Boral Limited for a pilot-scale CO2 use project to improve the quality of recycled concrete, masonry and steel slag aggregates at New Berrima, New South Wales. Taylor said they would create “close to 470 direct jobs and deliver $412m of investment, much of this in regional areas”. No breakdown of this was provided in the initial statement. Critics say CCS is too often used as a means to prop up fossil fuel industries when the world should be investing in genuinely clean solutions. Kids Helpline announced today that duty-of-care interventions to protect children and young people were 99% higher nationally between 1 December 2020 and 31 May compared with the same period a year ago. The escalation over the past six months across Australia is largely related to suicide attempts (38%) and child abuse (35%). Kids Helpline is a service run by the youth charity yourtown. Its CEO, Tracy Adams, said the organisation had feared an increase in child vulnerability as a result of the pandemic and ensuing lockdowns. “However, the current spike in emergency interventions on behalf of children and young people in New South Wales and Victoria is very disturbing,” she said. New South Wales has had an increase of 40% in duty of care interventions enacted by Kids Helpline on behalf of children and young people for the period 1 December 2020 to 31 May 2021 versus the same period a year ago. For those children and young people aged between 5 and 25 years of age, 44% of emergency interventions over the past six months in New South Wales have been in response to child abuse and 35% have been in response to an immediate intent to enact suicide. Victoria has had an increase of 184% in duty-of-care interventions enacted by Kids Helpline on behalf of children and young people for the period 1 December 2020 to 31 May 2021 versus the same period a year ago. Kids Helpline’s Victorian data over the last six months reveals that 75% of emergency interventions were for young people aged 13 to 18 years of age. For those children and young people aged between 5 to 25 years of age, 44% of emergency interventions over the past six months in Victoria have been in response to an immediate intent to enact suicide, with child abuse accounting for 31%. It is very clear that the pandemic is taking a toll on the lives of children and young people, however, thankfully by young people seeking help Kids Helpline has supported 862 suicide prevention interventions nationally in the past six months. Children and young people who want to talk to someone about any issue of concern to them can contact Kids Helpline on 1800 551 800, 24 hours a day, seven days a week or use email or web-counselling services at kidshelpline.com.au. The Aged and Community Services Association says other states and territories should follow Western Australia’s decision to make the Covid-19 vaccine mandatory for aged care workers. The association’s chairperson, Sara Blunt, said: Vaccinating aged care residents and the workforce is an essential protection for older Australians, particularly as Covid circulation and outbreaks continue in the community. Victoria, NSW, South Australian and Queensland have made positive moves towards giving aged care workers priority access at their vaccination hubs, but we must step up the effort. We support the introduction of mandatory Covid vaccines for both residential and home care workers, with appropriate exemptions on medical and other significant grounds. This must be done in a way that increases vaccination rates without adversely impacting on workforce numbers, at a time when the sector needs more workers to support the extra demands of Covid and the implementation of the royal commission reforms. Governments showed during the pandemic how quickly and co-operatively they could work during a crisis. Let’s see the same ingenuity and urgency applied by Australian governments to safeguard tens of thousands of lives with greater vaccination of aged care residents and workers. Business conditions struck a fresh record high in May, pointing to an extension of the rapid economic recovery from last year’s recession and a drop in the jobless rate in coming months, reports AAP. However, the Victorian Covid-19 lockdown continues to sap consumer confidence, particularly, and unsurprisingly, among Melburnians. National Australia Bank’s monthly survey posted a second consecutive record peak for business conditions in May, rising five points to 37 points. Index components for trade, employment and profitability also hit new highs. NAB chief economist Alan Oster said overall the survey was another very strong result for the business sector and forward indicators pointed to ongoing strength in the near term. The economy now appears to be entering a new period of growth after a very rapid rebound. McGowan says Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people aged 16 and over will also now be eligible to be vaccinated. He says: State-run clinics like Claremont Showgrounds, Joondalup, Kwinana and Redcliffe will be scaled up from next week to administer the Pfizer vaccine to the eligible younger demographic. Claremont will begin with appointments from the 30- to 49-year cohort from this Thursday. Western Australian premier Mark McGowan has just announced the government will open up the Covid-19 vaccine rollout to people 30 years old and older. He says: Western Australians between 30 and 49 will be able to get the Covid-19 vaccination with bookings opening today. We are fast-tracking the rollout of the Covid-19 vaccination program offering the vaccine to all eligible Western Australians over the age of 30. This means those aged between 30 and 49 will receive the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine at state-run clinics, starting this Thursday 10 June. And people aged over 50 will continue to receive the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine. The Productivity Commission chair, Michael Brennan, has warned that Australia shouldn’t continue debt-and-deficit fiscal policy even if low interest rates allow the country to (for a time). In a speech to the Committee for the Economic Development of Australia, Brennan rejected the view that “debt and deficit no longer matter at all” – a rebuttal of modern monetary theory. Brennan said: In the economists’ language, the view that growth rates will outpace interest rates provides some comfort about the sustainability of existing, steady state debt levels, but it gives no guidance as to which steady state debt level we should choose. In choosing a debt level, there is both a macroeconomic and a microeconomic case for caution. The macro case is, first, that we need to rebuild fiscal buffers for the next emergency. Second, that if inflation did re-emerge, or if bond yields exceeded nominal growth for a period – not impossible for a resource exporter like Australia – then, by implication, we would need a fiscal consolidation. Successful fiscal consolidations in history are rare. They are not often popular. And they would likely be even less popular in a period of rising inflation or falling terms of trade or slow real growth or rising interest rates, but those are the very circumstances in which our currently favourable debt dynamics would reverse. The second microeconomic argument against debt and deficit is that the government spending would crowd out private investment. Brennan also argued that despite Covid-19’s interruption to global supply chains, self-sufficiency was unlikely to work in the Australian context, after an unhappy 80 years protecting domestic manufacturing at great expense. Brennan suggested firms should aim for bigger inventories and Australia should diversify trading relationships rather than aim to make everything itself. This is happening next week in NZ. My colleague Josh Taylor has the latest on the youngest daughter of the Tamil family from Biloela. She has been airlifted to hospital in Perth. You can read Josh’s wrap of home affairs minister Karen Andrews’ comments below. It includes this paragraph: According to evidence provided to Senate estimates from the department in May, the cost to detain the family on Christmas Island between August 2019 and the end of January 2021 has been $6.7m, including $2.3m in detention, food, cleaning and school costs, $1.2m for travel costs, $100,000 for medical costs, $1m for legal and translation costs and $2.1m in staffing costs. South Australia has expanded its Covid-19 vaccine rollout to all people aged 40 to 49 ahead of the allocation of $86m in this month’s budget to further expand the program, reports AAP. The state has also extended access to the Pfizer vaccine to all disability workers, while SA Health has granted an exemption for the Geelong AFL team to enter the state for the game against Port Adelaide on Thursday night. The chief public health officer, Prof Nicola Spurrier, said the travelling group would be limited to 50 people and testing requirements would be rigorous, with players required to return a negative result before being allowed to travel into South Australia. The Geelong team has also been placed in quarantine from Monday night and will need to sign a declaration that they have not visited any sites of concern in Victoria. They will fly in on a charter plane and leave immediately after the game, as Collingwood did for their match against the Adelaide Crows last weekend. Spurrier said: We’ve got SA Pathology on board to do the rapid turnaround of tests. The premier, Steven Marshall, said giving every South Australian access to the vaccine was a key priority and the budget allocation would allow efforts to be maximised. He said: This $86 million investment will mean SA Health will have the resources they need to be able to pivot where required to get this vital vaccine into the arms of South Australians. South Australia’s health and economic response to the pandemic has led the world, and we will continue to scale up the state’s vaccine rollout in a way that maximises our vaccine supplies, protects South Australians and aligns with the latest health advice. This is quite a statistic. Just to let you know, we are expecting a vaccine update from the Western Australian premier, Mark McGowan, shortly. Thousands of people have already applied for the federal government’s Covid-19 disaster payment after claims opened today. The government said in a statement that “thousands of claims have been successfully lodged and Services Australia has already started granting claims”. Linda Reynolds, the government services minister, said: Services Australia staff are now processing Covid-19 disaster payment claims and prioritising payments and services to support Victorians through this current lockdown period. Once a claim has been lodged, using a Centrelink online account through myGov, customers do not need to do anything else. When their claim is approved, customers should get their payment the next business day. Customers will receive an SMS when their claim is submitted. People don’t need to call to check on their claim. We expect significant interest in this payment and ask that people be patient, especially during the first few days as Services Australia processes these claims for support. Payments will also be backdated to the date someone first became eligible, rather than the date the claim was lodged. You can make a claim through your MyGov account. Those who can’t claim online can call 80 22 66 for support. Phone lines are open 8am to 5pm, Monday to Friday. Eligible visa holders will need to call Services Australia on 180 22 66 to claim. For more information on the Covid-19 disaster payment go to servicesaustralia.gov.au/covid19. Matilda mentioned some terrible news out of Queensland earlier. Here are some more details. A woman has been mauled to death by three dogs she was minding in the Queensland city of Maryborough, reports AAP. The woman, aged in her 30s or 40s, suffered horrific injuries when the animals turned on her at a Milton Road property about 9am on Tuesday. The three mixed-breed dogs have been seized by the local council and are expected to be destroyed. Acting inspector Wade Lee says the woman suffered head chest and arm injuries. Police believe the dogs belong to someone else and the woman had been taking care of them. Paramedics were called but she died at the scene. Lee told reporters: The dogs were in an enclosed yard. At this stage it is just a very tragic accident. Police have not named the woman. AAP also has more on the new NSW Labor deputy leader. Londonderry MP Prue Car has been appointed deputy leader of NSW Labor, putting an end to weeks of party instability. The former shadow education minister was elected unanimously on Tuesday, when the party also selected Penny Sharpe and John Graham as joint upper house leaders. In a statement, Car said she was excited to work with newly minted leader Chris Minns. Carr said: Like Chris, I understand the pressures on family budgets and the impact of the outrageous cost of [road] tolls. Like Chris, I want to see our schools properly funded and staffed. It will be an honour to serve as deputy leader of my party and to help take a positive vision for NSW to the 2023 election. With all leadership positions filled, the party is hoping to put a damaging few weeks behind them. NSW Labor was thrown into turmoil when Jodi McKay resigned as leader on 28 May, alleging destabilisation within the party. Let’s take a quick look at the markets, via AAP. Shares have climbed to a record high on the Australian market, with property and information technology stocks faring best. The ASX200 had peaked at 7315.6 points by 1200 AEST, although gains were relatively tame across the market. Property shares led the way and were higher by 0.82%. Information technology stocks were next best and higher by 0.69%. Shares in materials, financials and energy were little changed. The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index was higher by 8.9 points, or 0.12%, to 7290.8 at 1200 AEST. The All Ordinaries was up by 11.8 points, or 0.15%, to 7543.4. There were slight falls on US markets amid a lack of market-moving news. Thanks Matilda. Luke Henriques-Gomes here. I’ll be with you for the next short while. You can contact me on Twitter @lukehgomes with tips and suggestions, or via email at luke.henriques-gomes@theguardian.com On that note, applications for the federal government’s Covid-19 disaster payment opened today. Claims can be made via Services Australia, so if you’re in Victoria and trying to apply, do let me know how you’re getting on with the process. With that, I shall leave you, but the fantastic Luke Henriques-Gomes is stepping in to take you through the afternoon. Liberal senator Andrew Bragg says he believes Australians will support a legislated voice to parliament and an amendment to the constitution that obliges the commonwealth to ensure that Indigenous peoples are heard. Bragg – the backbencher who is leading efforts to persuade colleagues to adopt the Uluru statement – will use a speech to the Sydney Institute on Tuesday night to try and map a pathway through the Coalition’s internal differences. Bragg’s efforts have also been backed by the New South Wales premier, Gladys Berejiklian, who used remarks at a book launch earlier this week to argue the Uluru statement contains “deeply liberal ideals”. In endorsing Bragg’s campaign, Berejiklian also noted “a growing mood for change on the issue of reconciliation”. You can read the full report below: An 18-year-old man from NSW is fighting for his life in a coma after he was crushed by a whale in a freak accident on the state’s south coast, reports Tiffanie Turnbull from AAP. Friends Nick and Matt were fishing in waters off Narooma on Sunday when the whale surfaced and landed on their boat. Both men were injured, but 18-year-old Nick was rushed to hospital in Canberra with a broken neck and severe head injuries. He remains in a coma. Family friend Carmen Bartley said the pair had no warning and no idea the whale was nearby. A GoFundMe appeal for donations was started to help cover Nick’s medical expenses. Here Bartley wrote: At this stage, we don’t know when he will wake up, or how this has affected his brain. Police on Tuesday issued an appeal for boaties to be alert, with whale migration season bringing scores of the animals to NSW waters. If, like me, you are struggling to keep up with where all the exposure sites are, Guardian Australia have you covered. (Not even speaking as an employee but just a Melburnian, can I just say the explainers below have been a lifesaver!) Here are all the Victorian sites: And don’t worry, we have NSW covered for you as well: Wild winds are easing after battering Victoria overnight, prompting more than 100 calls for help, as a large air mass from the Antarctic brings damaging weather across several states. A severe weather warning for parts of the Victoria’s north-east and Gippsland regions was cancelled early on Tuesday morning following strong overnight winds. Alpine areas including Mount Buller and Mount William recorded wind gusts over 100km/h to 8am on Tuesday. Closer to Melbourne, Kilmore (91km/h) and Fawkner (72km/h) north of the city were also hit by the strong gusts. You can read the full report below: After the ousting of NSW Labor leader Jodi McKay, MP Chris Minns was elected by the party to the top job. This morning he officially announced his deputy leader has now been appointed, the member for Londonderry and the current shadow minister for education Prue Car. The Department of Home Affairs has issued a statement denying allegations of inaction or mistreatment of the youngest daughter of the Tamil family from Biloela on Christmas Island. Tharnicaa Murugappan was evacuated from Christmas Island with her mother, Priya, on Monday evening to get medical treatment after Tharnicaa had been unwell for 10 days, with a fever, vomiting, diarrhoea and dizziness. Family friend Angela Fredericks told ABC News Breakfast Tharnicaa was being treated for a blood infection, sepsis, potentially caused by untreated pneumonia, questioning why it had taken so long for the three-year-old to get treatment from health officials on Christmas Island. The Department of Home Affairs issued a statement on Tuesday strongly denying any delay in medical care: The minor has been receiving medical treatment and daily monitoring on Christmas Island consistent with medical advice. This has included an IHMS general practitioner and the Christmas Island Hospital. As soon as the ABF was advised by the treating medical practitioners that the minor required medical treatment in Western Australia, the minor was transferred to a hospital in Western Australia. The Australian Border Force strongly denies any allegations of inaction or mistreatment of individuals in its care. OK, there will be a police press conference about the woman who was killed by dogs in Queensland at 11.45 am where we should get some more updates. But for now, Queensland police have confirmed they were called to a Milton Road address in Maryborough just after 9am. They had received reports that several dogs, they believe three, were attacking a person. Victorian testing commander Jeroen Weimar says a vaccination hub has been made a tier-three exposure site, with those who were there asked to monitor for symptoms. We had two cases that tested positive yesterday. Both existed in primary close contacts. We identified, as a result of that, a number of additional exposure sites. To correct the earlier statement, one positive case had a brief visit to the vaccination centre at Jeff’s Shed yesterday afternoon. That is now a tier 3 exposure site. They completed their test and they went off and got – tried to get a vaccination. They were advised to go back to isolation. We have two primary close contacts at the exhibition site now who dealt with the individual. It is a tier 3 PPE environment. It is well controlled. We’re confident there is no wider risk to the public but out of caution, we have listed it as a tier 3 site. 7 News is reporting that a woman has died after being mauled by a pack of dogs in Queensland. I’ll bring you more updates as soon as I can. Acting premier James Merlino has come out swinging against the Victorian Liberals after they spent the morning demanding Daniel Andrews release details of his back injury in March, fuelling the flames of a number of conspiracy theories currently circulating. We are dealing with a global pandemic, for goodness sake. I treat it with the contempt that it deserves. This is more about how the Liberal party treat people. No decency, no respect, they should be ashamed of themselves. I am honestly not going to spend much time on this. I think it is a disgraceful act by the Liberal party ... They should be ashamed of themselves, quite frankly. You can’t put to bed conspiracy nutters and if the Liberal party want to act disgracefully, that is a matter for them. Merlino has said again that developments today haven’t changed the timeline when it comes to the lockdown. I can’t foreshadow anything today, other than to reassure all Victorians that today doesn’t change our plans. We remain on track to provide further easing of restrictions in regional Victoria and careful easing of restrictions in Melbourne. We remain absolutely on track to deliver that. That is by virtue of the excellent work of our contact tracers. Merlino noted that the government was is considering easing the travel restrictions between Melbourne and regional Victoria on Friday. It remains the public health advice that for a period of time, we will have different settings between regional Victoria and metropolitan Melbourne. That will extend beyond any announcements that we will make later in the week. We wanted to be upfront and honest with people at the earliest opportunity, particularly because we’re coming up to the long weekend, so we are on track for an easing of restrictions, as planned this week, but there will be different settings for a period of time between regional Victoria and Melbourne. No local Covid-19 cases in NSW in case you were wondering! The home affairs minister, Karen Andrews, has said the government is looking at a “range of resettlement options” when asked about the fate of Tamil family from Biloela. The three-year-old, Australian-born youngest daughter of the family, Tharnicaa, was airlifted out of Christmas Island on Monday evening after 10 days of symptoms including a fever and taken to Perth Children’s hospital, where advocates say she has been provided antibiotics and could potentially have sepsis. In her role, Andrews has the power to intervene at any moment and allow the family to remain in Australia, but she said on Monday she could not comment on their future because negotiations on resettlement for a number of asylum seekers in Australia is currently under way: We are going through the process now of investigating a range of resettlement options in relation to a number of different circumstances here in Australia. I can’t make public commentary on that at the moment because I don’t want to disrupt those negotiations. It is the first time resettlement has been floated as an option by the government, previously Andrews had indicated the family could be put into the community on Christmas Island while their legal process is still ongoing. The family has been held in detention on Christmas Island since late 2019, after an emergency court injunction prevented their removal from Australia to Sri Lanka while a court case was underway. Gosh, we got so caught up on the Delta link I forgot to mention where those two local cases of Covid-19 today came from. Here is acting premier James Merlino from before with that information. One is a child linked to the west Melbourne outbreak, one is a household contact of a worker linked to the Arcare Maidstone outbreak. Both have limited community exposure and Jerome can speak to that later in terms of answers any questions. A number of exposure sites were put onto the website last night and we encourage all Victorians to continue to check that website and follow that health advice. While we never want to see new cases, it is reassuring that we are again seeing these cases with clear links to existing outbreaks. Prof Cheng said the returned traveller lives in the Glen Ira local government area, but confirmed that as he only returned there after being clear of his Covid-19 diagnosis and left hotel quarantine it’s unlikely he has spread the virus to the area. Again, just as anyone in Victoria, if you are unwell, please get tested. We are not particularly concerned about his movements after he was discharged from hotel quarantine because we don’t think he was infectious but for the abundance of caution we are obviously following up his contacts as well. Cheng says there may be a missing link between the returned traveller and the family infected with the Delta variants of Covid-19. Reporter: You are working on the fact there is probably a missing link between the west Melbourne family and this man? Cheng: At this stage that’s the hypothesis we are working on but obviously if there was any direct interaction we would want to know that. We don’t know that at this stage. Reporter: Just one missing link with those dates do you think it would just be the one? Cheng: We can’t really tell. I think in terms of timing, yes, that probably is about right but we didn’t – the first person in the North Melbourne cluster became symptomatic probably around the 25th. One of those cases was thought to be historical by that time so there is still a little bit of uncertainty about which exactly was the first case and therefore that determines how many people might be in between. Last week the Australian reported that a hotel quarantine facility has stored dirty linen from positive cases inside bins in an underground car park that local residents also has access to. This was at the Ibis in Melbourne. This most recent hotel quarantine breach case spent time in an Ibis hotel but Prof Cheng could not confirm which location. Reporter: Have you guys been examining whether or not that situation may have contributed to this leak?... Correction Victoria commissioner Emma Cassar: We have investigated those allegations and can confirm that there is no sharing of entries with the residents. The residents actually enter on the opposite side of the building and myself and two of our deputy state controllers of health inspected that and we are satisfied with the controls in place. If you are wondering when this hotel quarantine case might have infected someone in the community, deputy chief health officer Prof Allen Cheng has you covered: The first possibility is that the case transmitted to or was infected by another passenger on the plane and that that person has gone on to infect someone in the community. The second possibility is that the case transmitted after he left hotel quarantine. The third is that the case transmitted to a staff member somewhere along their journey from the airport to transport to the first hotel to transport to the second hotel and then out to the community. And then the fourth possibility is that the case transmitted to a hotel resident who has then transmitted to the community after their quarantine stay. We have addressed all of these and some of these are still ongoing investigations. The government services minister, Danny Pearson, says health authorities are still trying to work out how the returned traveller accidentally spread Covid-19 into the community. The traveller arrived from Sri Lanka on 8 May and tested positive that same day. He was transferred from the Novatel Ibis quarantine hotel to the Holiday Inn health hotel on 14 May. He completed his quarantine and was released on 23 May. Pearson investigations remain ongoing but he can so far confirm the following: There were 24 people on the traveller’s plane including crew, all passengers tested negative. All Skybus crew from that shift tested negative. 268 CQV staff worked at the hotel IBIS on 8 and 9 May and 360 staff at the health hotel. No positive tests have been identified to date and staff surveillance testing is being examined. All 12 residents housed on the same floor in the Novatel Ibis health hotel have tested negative. None of the residents in the health hotel during this period had the virus. All CQV staff at the hotel Ibis and Holiday Inn were vaccinated by 3 May. And Merlino hasn’t missed a beat using the news of yet another hotel quarantine break to attack the federal government’s reliance on the system. Hotels are built for tourists, not for managing infectious diseases. There have been at least 21 breaches in hotel quarantine right around this country. Just in the last month, we have seen three outbreaks, one in South Australia and two in WA. Despite all the protections that we put in place, appropriately put in place, vaccination of staff, daily testing of staff, PPE, N95 masks, ventilation works just to name a few, we cannot eliminate risk in this environment. The fact that Howard Springs is the only system in the country that has seen no breaches really speaks for itself. That’s why we pushed so hard to get a purpose-built quarantine facility. Howard Springs is the only facility in this country that has not seen a breach and that’s exactly why we have been pushing for this purpose-built facility. The best-case scenario was that this was done a year ago. The next best scenario is that we get it done immediately. I am very pleased, as we have heard over the last few days, that that’s received the support of the federal government. We will get this facility built – this purpose-built facility – built as quickly as possible and in the mean time we will do our absolute best within our hotel quarantine system to reduce risk as much as is humanely possible. While Merlino was certainly making no promises, he sounded cautiously optimistic about Melbourne’s ability to at least partially come out of lockdown at the end of the week, and for further restrictions to be eased in regional Victoria. Thanks to their outstanding work we remain on track to later in this week announce, as we have said we have planned to do all along, further easing of restriction in regional Victoria and careful easing of restrictions in Melbourne. This cluster was discovered after the lockdown was in place and nothing about today changes our plan. So I just want to send that very reassuring message to all Victorians. Nothing about today changes our plans. Thanks to the outstanding work of our contact tracing team, we remain on track to deliver a further easing of restrictions in regional Victoria and easing of restrictions in Melbourne. Huzzah! Victorian officials have finally linked the mystery Delta variant outbreak to a returned traveller from hotel quarantine (and not from NSW). As we advised last week with assistance from the Doherty Institute, we have been checking all known positive cases against the genomic sequencing for the cases in this cluster. I can confirm today that we have now found a match between a returned traveller who entered hotel quarantine in Melbourne on 8 May and this cluster. While we have a genomic link, we do not currently have an ep deem logical link, further investigations are underway to see if we are able to establish any contact between the returned traveller and these families. There’s currently no definitive understanding of where a transmission events may have occurred but we are investigating all possibilities from the plane to travel to hotel. Speaking of Victoria, acting premier James Merlino is speaking now to give a Covid-19 update. Oh my gosh. The “Daniel Andrews falling conspiracy theory” drama in Victoria keeps getting funnier today! With permission from the premier, Ambulance Victoria has released the details of their call out for his injury. The home affairs minister, Karen Andrews, says the department is considering “a range of resettlement options” for the Biloela family. This is a considerably softer approach than other government figures have indicated today. We are going through the process now of investigating a range of resettlement options in relation to a number of different circumstances here in Australia. I can’t make public commentary on that at the moment because I don’t want to disrupt those negotiations. Andrews was then asked why she won’t make a captains call on the Biloela family and allow them to return to their home in regional Queensland. As the prime minister already said, there is already a matter before the court in relation to the issue with the young child. That child is now receiving appropriate medical care in Perth. (Worth remember that those court cases absolutely do not stop Andrews from using ministerial discretion to bring them home straight away.) Questions have turned now to the Biloela family, with Morrison being asked when a decision on their case will be made. As you know, this is a matter going through the court’s process that they’ve initiated and there are some present medical issues involving the family. And they will continue to receive every medical care and that care and where they are treated will continue to be determined by doctors, by the medical professionals who advise us on these matters. Kershaw is laying out why the APF need the extended telecommunication security bill passed in order to tackle crime on the dark web. We’re really encouraging the parliament to pass that bill in particular and the IPO bill. Because we need to be ahead. We need to be a step ahead and encrypted comms and going dark on the dark web. As you know, there’s multiple crimes. If you go on there right now, you can purchase whatever you want. There’s proliferation of child sexual abuse material on the dark web. It’s an absolute disgrace. So for us, that’s a criminal marketplace that we can’t actually penetrate without that legislation. According to AFP commissioner Reece Kershaw, underworld kingpins are turning on each other after the arrests. Well, they all turn on each other. The other thing that we learnt is that they actually do a lot of business behind each other’s backs, including the presidents of various groups and organisations for personal wealth. So there’s going to be a whole lot of disruption there, and our state police colleagues are on alert for that. Because there’s no doubt going to be some tension within the whole system about who owes what drug debt and so on. So that was pretty brazen to see that they were actually disloyal to their own groups. OK, so we have got through all the cool things the AFP has down. Scott Morrison is now coming in full force with his pitch for getting his increased police powers bill. There are three things that we need to do. One of them does relate to air and the transport security laws that are in this country. The first one is that there’s is surveillance legislation amendment which is about identifying and disrupting, and the AFP and the ACIC powers to combat serious crime on the dark web, and in circumstances where anonomising technologies with detection of serious crime. We have law in the parliament at the moment which does not have bipartisan support, which we need support for, to give them powers to do that. The telecommunications legislation amendment – international production orders bill ... That does not have bipartisan support and we need it passed. And the third one is the Transport Security Amendment of Serious Crime bill. That is the bill that is needed to stop organised criminals getting access to our walls and to our airports. We have sought to have this bill passed through three successive parliaments. And it still continues to be opposed by Labor. Now, this is critical to ensure that criminals don’t get on to our walls. That they can’t access security credentials and things of that nature. I don’t know why they’re being protective. I can’t give you an answer to that. We want to shut it down. Kershaw says the infiltration into this encrypted app allowed authorities to prevent a mass shooting, although he did not go into details as to where this would have taken place. He said this was not intended as a terrorist act. It’s organised crime. So that particular case will come out later on where they were using a machine gun and potentially at a cafe where people would have been no doubt harmed. We were able to, with the cooperation of that particular state police force, take out that individual before they were able to do that. Kershaw said he could not give more details as arrests into that incident were still being carried out. OK, now we are getting some of the details of this fake FBI app. Reporter: Do you think that the people you were targeting had any idea that you were listening and watching? AFP Commissioner Reece Kershaw: No. Let me be clear. When you get access and it will come out in court, you’ll see that all they talk about is drugs, violence, hits on each other, innocent people who are going to be murdered. A whole range of things ... It would be like, “I need 1,000 kilos at this price”. Very brazen. No attempt to hide behind any kind of codified kind of conversation. Including we’ll have a speed boat to meet you at this. And this is who will be doing that? Heads up, we are expecting to hear from the Victorian government and health authorities at 10.30am. OK so that’s the achievements, here comes the “war on drugs” rhetoric from prime minister Scott Morrison. People sitting at home might be thinking – what can we do to help the AFP? In this battle against organised crime in this country. I want to make a few comments about illicit drug use in this country. There’s nothing social about illicit drug use in this country. It fuels organised crime in this country. It fuels human misery in this country and in many parts of the world. There’s nothing social about it. It’s dangerous. And all of us have a responsibility, all of us have a responsibility in our own relationships and our own families, in our own communities, to be doing what we can to encourage positive behaviours, positive behaviours that don’t indulge illicit drug use. Illicit drug use ruins lives and it fuels organised crime. Cue the appeal to the children: The AFP will do their job and we’ll make sure that they’re resourced to do their job. We also have a job to do. Let’s keep Australia safe. Let’s ensure that illicit drug use in this country doesn’t take our children. Kershaw: This was brought out of the close long-standing relationship between the AFP and the FBI. Our relationships and international networks were mobilised and it is these partnerships which have made this operation a success. Partnering with the AFP, the AFP had access to a new encrypted application named ANOM. And began running it without the knowledge of the criminal underworld. And the AFP provided the highly skilled technical staff and capability to decrypt and read these encrypted communications sent over ANOM in real time. Giving law enforcement an edge that it had never had before. Essentially, we have been in the back pockets of organised crime and operationalised the criminal takedown like we have never seen. The Australian federal police commissioner, Reece Kershaw, says 224 people have been charged so far. As the minister stated, more than 4,000 officers from law enforcement in Australia have been involved in executing over 525 search warrants in every mainland state in Australia. We have arrested the alleged kingmakers behind these crimes. Prevented mass shootings in suburbs and frustrated serious and organised crime by seizing their ill-gotten wealth. As of today, we have charged 224 alleged offenders, including 525 charges laid. Shut down six clandestine laboratories and acted on 21 threats to kill, including saving a family of five. And seized 104 firearms and weapons and almost $45m in cash. And these figures are likely to increase over the coming days. Collectively, these alleged offenders are facing jail terms that could run into hundreds of years and some of the charges they are facing carry life imprisonment. It looks like the prime minister is using news the massive drug to try and gain support for giving the Australian federal police, and law enforcement in general, greater powers. (A line of rhetoric that always make me really nervous.) But what’s important as we go forward from this point is not just the support that we continue to provide that we see in the budget, but we need to continue to provide our law enforcement authorities with the powers and the authorities that they need to do this job. I’ll going into this later in questions, but there is a series of legislation, not just in this term, but in some cases over three terms. They need these powers to do their job. The AFP and our law enforcement agencies who support them need the support of our parliament to continue to do the job that they do to continue to keep Australians safe. Our government won’t shirk from that and we call on all of those in the parliament to do that as we have done for such a long time and to get the results that in particular we’ve seen today. Morrison: Operation Ironside has now charged hundreds of alleged offenders. Seized millions of dollars in criminal processes. Removed weapons from our streets and saved lives. And we’ll continue to. It is an ongoing operation. The operation puts Australia at the forefront of the fight against criminals who peddle in misery and ultimately, it will keep our communities and Australians safe. More than 4,000 police officers across Australia have been involved in this operation. There’s not a day that goes past when I am not thankful for the work of all of our police. All of our police all around the country. They step up for our protection. They take upon themselves great risks. They see things. They’re involved in these things that the rest of the citizens don’t have to see. And for that, we owe every single police officer our great thanks and afford them our great respect. So let’s talk about this drug bust news. The Australian federal police hasn’t put out a full statement yet but media reports today suggest more than 100 members of Australia’s underworld including the “mafia” and bikie group have been arrested in a huge international crime sting. For years the AFP worked with the FBI to trick underworld figures into communicating via an encrypted app known as AN0M. Unfortunately for the underworld figures, the police created the app. Authorities say they were able to read up to 25 million messages and uncovered 21 murder plots, seized more than 3,000kg of drugs and found $35m in cash. The prime minister is speaking about the operation now: Today, the Australian government, as part of a global operation, has struck a heavy blow against organised crime – not just in this country, but one that will echo around organised crime around the world. This is a watershed moment in Australian law enforcement history. This has not been independently confirmed by Guardian Australia as of yet but advocates for the Bioela family say three-year-old Tharnicaa has been diagnosed with pneumonia after been medically evacuated from detention in Christmas Island to Perth. It’s been a bit of a heavy morning so far, so here is some dinosaur news from the Guardian’s amazing new science reporter Donna Lu: A new species of dinosaur discovered in south-west Queensland has been officially recognised as the largest ever found in Australia and among the biggest in the world. The Australotitan cooperensis, a plant-eating dinosaur of the family known as titanosaurs, likely lived between 92m and 96m years ago, during the Cretaceous period. It was between 25m and 30m long, stood between 5m and 6.5m from the ground to its hip and had a very long neck and tail, making it similar in appearance to well-known dinosaurs such as Brachiosaurus and Apatosaurus. You can read the full story below: Less than 3% of Australians over 16 have been fully vaccinated against coronavirus but health chiefs are tipping numbers will soar in coming weeks. The sluggish national rollout of jabs continues to spark concern with Melbourne in the grips of another lockdown-inducing outbreak, reports Matt Coughlan from AAP. While the immunisation program is ramping up, just 613,000 people, or about 2.9% of the nation’s adults, have received both doses. Chief nursing officer Prof Alison McMillan told Sky News on Tuesday she is confident that figure will grow significantly with many people nearing the 12-week gap between AstraZeneca shots. Case numbers have remained relatively low in Victoria but an emergence of the Delta and Kappa strains prevalent in India are causing authorities concern. McMillan declared vaccination would be the only way to counter emerging variants. There are multiple strains and we will continue to see Covid adapt and mutate – that’s what these viruses do. We’re likely to see other strains emerging. The sooner we can get the world vaccinated, the less likely it is that it can mutate. It mutates and finds it easier to do when there’s a significant population infected at any one time. More than 5 million doses have been administered nationwide including more than 1 million over the past 10 days. We are just waiting on a press conference from the AFP and prime minister on massive international drug bust operations and arrests across Australia and New Zealand. We heard from the NZ police just before: [There were] 37 search warrants resulting in the arrest of 35 people who are appearing before the court today on serious drug dealing, money laundering and other conspiracy-type charges. To date we’ve seized during the course of these operations about 8.6kg of meth that came in through the border. Yesterday, we recovered about 20kg of methamphetamine, over $1 million in cash, four firearms, multiple kilos of iodine and we restrained about $3.7 million of assets to date. Warrants are coming in and we expect a number of other arrests to be undertaken. The prime minister is expected to speak to the media about this around 9.30 am. Support for the Coalition’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic has fallen to its lowest level since the outbreak began, as almost half of all voters view the federal government less favourably than they did a year ago. But the findings, contained in the latest Guardian Essential poll, also show that voters in locked-down Victoria are spreading the blame for the latest outbreak, with both the Coalition and the Andrews government losing ground over the past month among voters in the state. Overall, one in four voters now believe the Morrison government is doing a “very poor” or “quite poor” job of managing the pandemic, the highest level since March last year, and six percentage points higher than when the same question was asked a fortnight ago. You can read the full story below: Oh, and no new local cases in Queensland in case anyone was wondering. (They weren’t.) The daily numbers are out and it seems there are two new locally acquired cases. A former defence chief has blasted the approval of a $500m redevelopment of the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, reports AAP. Retired admiral Chris Barrie has been a vocal opponent of the major project, fearing it will completely undermine the national institution. On Tuesday he told ABC radio: I guess the game is over in terms of the fact it is going to happen, but I’m afraid it won’t be a memorial for very much longer. It might be a place of entertainment but in my view it will not be the place of remembrance that I grew up with. Barrie said the redevelopment would turn the memorial into a theme park. I recall the place of remembrance that I used to take visitors to as being unique around the world. To try and turn it into a theme park or a place of entertainment, whatever words we want to use, is not right. Barrie said he is most concerned that in the pursuit of a “bigger and better” attraction, future generations of Australians will lose the opportunity to quietly reflect on the country’s military history. The National Capital Authority has given the nod for early works at the memorial, including the demolition of Anzac Hall. At least 140 trees will be removed as part of the redevelopment, which will eventually be replaced by 250 native trees. The NCA, which has published a 1200-page consultation report, received 601 submissions during its consultation process, of which just three were in support. Key concerns were the need for the expansion, tree removal, the impacts on heritage values and the cost. The memorial argues the project will address constraints to the existing use of the building, improve the overall visitor and veterans’ experience and maintain its significance as a national cultural institution. Up to 30% of residents in some aged care homes have not taken up a Covid-19 vaccination, according to new data that has prompted an investigation into the high rates of non-uptake. Council on the Ageing chief executive Ian Yates said the most recent data shared with stakeholders was collated last week and showed most homes reported a refusal rate of between 5% and 15%. The data does not reveal why residents had declined the vaccine, but Yates said doctors would not have recommended it for a significant number due to underlying health conditions. The federal government was now focusing on homes with the highest levels of non-uptake to uncover why so many residents had chosen not to get vaccinated against Covid-19, he said. The minister for senior Australians and aged care services, Richard Colbeck, said: The department of health is examining overall consent data to review instances where consent rates are significantly low as part of planning for any required follow up activity with these facilities. But he said aged care facilities are responsible for supporting and obtaining residents’ consent to receive both doses of the vaccine. This includes early discussions on consent, including engagement with family and guardians, and treating general practitioners, as required. I’m sorry, I’m still laughing at the idea that Daniel Andrews would have been filming himself when he slipped on the steps. That’s wild. Coronavirus vaccines are being made available to all National Disability Insurance Scheme participants aged over 16, reports Daniel McCulloch from AAP. National cabinet has approved the rapid expansion to speed up the sluggish vaccine rollout across the vulnerable disability sector. It comes after dedicated vaccination hubs for people with disabilities, support workers and primary carers were given the green light. The disability minister, Linda Reynolds, made a statement this morning: We are working quickly to provide more locations for people to receive their vaccination in safe, accessible settings ... It is a particularly important step forward that both paid and unpaid carers of NDIS participants are now able to get the vaccination as soon as possible. The number of vaccinated NDIS participants is slowly growing. Almost 40,500 NDIS participants (16%) have received at least one dose of the vaccine. More than 7,800 NDIS participants living in group homes and aged care settings – 28% of the population – have been given at least one jab. However, people in disability care were considered the highest priority group and the vaccine rollout is still months behind schedule. Now, this fairly bold move by the Victorian opposition hasn’t gone unnoticed by the state government. Treasurer Tim Pallas has called for them to make a public apology and labelled the theories “QAnon craziness”: This is nonsense ... we know it’s nonsense. What happened to Daniel Andrews was an unfortunate but very serious spinal injury. There’s nothing more to it ... Perhaps they [the Liberals] need to issue a public apology. Oh, and by the way, the leader of the Victorian opposition, Michael O’Brien, is also involved: Yikes, some weird stuff is going on in the Victoria parliament this morning. So the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has been off for a number of months now after falling on some wet steps and fracturing his spine. Since this happened a number of conspiracy theories have been bubbling away. But now it seems the state opposition is willing to play into these bizarre rumours publicly. Here is what the shadow treasurer, Louise Staley, had to say at a press conference this morning: Nobody’s got footage of the stairs. Nobody’s got really any idea where it happened and this is a very visual world these days where we seem to have everything out there on the media but not this. (I know personally I often film myself getting ready for work. If you’re lucky I’ll release the video of me making a cup of tea at 6.45am.) When asked by AAP reporter Benita Kolovos why she was “fuelling conspiracy theories”, Staley said: Well, the easiest way to stop any of these conspiracy theories – which I’m not playing into – is for these questions to be answered. Just staying on that ABC radio interview with Nationals MP Matt Canavan for a moment. He has been asked his views on the Biloela family’s situation, saying he believes the multimillion-dollar effort to keep the family in detention is worth it to protect Australia’s borders: I think what is “worth it” is that we do have strong border protections in this country that has made sure that we don’t have the atrocious and tragic trade of people that we saw around 10 years ago ... Of all of the courts, none have found that this family has refugee status. Therefore, they do not have a right to stay in this country. Now, they have chosen with their lawyers to fight and contest that. Now that’s their right, but of course, that leaves them ... in a place of limbo, if you like ... It’s certainly tragic what’s happened here to this young girl, but, given they have been found not to have refugee status ... they really cannot stay in this country. But they also have rights here, because we are a country of rights and laws of rights to challenge and contest that, but that does take time. NSW nationals MP Matt Canavan has labelled the idea of vaccine passports “un-Australian” after the former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull said on Monday that the government should seriously consider them. The passport proposal suggests certain activities, most centrally international travel, would require proof of vaccination, but Canavan told ABC Radio this morning that this went against Australian’s human rights: The idea that [being] free to go to the movies to travel to other states of Australia is somehow a gift to be given from the government is absolutely the wrong way around. In this free and fair country that we have, we have those freedoms, they are ours, they’re not given to us or gifted to us by the governance I say, they’re rights at birth as Australian citizens. They should never or only very rarely be restricted. And I don’t see any reason why at this stage we need to introduce vaccine passports. I’m confident that we will get to a high level of vaccinations as we do with other vaccines in this country, and then we’ll be able to get on with their lives. Not everyone will be vaccinated, but it will probably cover almost all vulnerable people. A former Bunnings Warehouse on the NSW north coast will be converted over the next six weeks into the state’s second Covid-19 vaccination hub. The centre, at Belmont in Lake Macquarie, is expected to be ready to administer up to 20,000 jabs a week from mid-July. The hub is the second for NSW, which already has a centre at Homebush in Sydney’s west delivering up to 5,000 injections a day, reports AAP. Premier Gladys Berejiklian made the announcement in a statement this morning: We are planning to replicate that model in the Hunter region, so we can quickly and safely vaccinate as many people as possible across NSW. The Lake Macquarie centre will employ up to 100 nurses, 25 pharmacists or pharmacy technicians plus about 200 other support staff. About 150 people will be hard at work converting the former Bunnings site over the next six weeks before it opens to residents in the region. The centre will administer both the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines, with bookings required. Labor Senator Kristina Keneally, who visited the Biloela family on Christmas Island this year, has fronted media this morning calling on the government to “bring them home”. She spoke to ABC News Breakfast just before: The family’s lawyers have put information in front of the minister about [older daughter] Kopika and Tharnicaa’s ongoing physical and mental health impacts of detention. And this latest emergency – this acute medical emergency – is unfortunately just a most recent example of the ongoing impacts that detention is having on these two little Australian-born girls. Today, I say to the minister for home affairs, and the minister for immigration, it’s time to bring this sorry saga, what we as a country are doing to these two little Australian-born girls to an end. Bring them home to Biloela, a town who wants and loves them. Keneally said the whole family should have been allowed to travel with the three-year-old on the medevac flight, rather than just her mother, Priya: All of this heartbreak for this family. The last thing they need right now is to be separated from one another and the last thing of course is this little girl, Tharnicaa, needs, is this type of medical emergency. Just back on the Biloela family, there is some controversy about the level of medical care three-year-old Tharnicaa may have received. Advocates for the family are alleging the detention centre staff didn’t take Tharnicaa to the hospital on Christmas Island until Sunday, despite multiple requests from her mother. A spokesperson for the Department of Home Affairs said both the department and Australian Border Force were committed to the welfare of detainees in immigration detention: Healthcare services for detainees on Christmas Island are broadly comparable with those available within the Australian community under the Australian public health system ... The ABF facilitates access to nurses, doctors and specialists for all members of the family. Good morning all, It’s Matilda Boseley here, ready to dive into this very lovely Tuesday with you. First up, it’s worth talking about what’s happening to the Biloela family, the Tamil family of four being held in immigration detention on Christmas Island. The youngest daughter, three-year-old Tharnicaa, has been medically evacuated to Perth with a suspected blood infection, renewing calls from advocates for the government to let the family return to their home in rural Queensland. A medical evacuation flight carrying Tharnicaa and her mother Priya landed at Perth airport on Monday evening, advocates for the family confirmed. They say Tharnicaa had been unwell for 10 days and might have septicaemia, experienced vomiting, diarrhoea, dizziness and a temperature of more than 40 degrees. Her mum Priya has released a short statement about the situation: I am feeling very scared and worried for my little girl ... She has been sick for many days, it took a long time for her to get to the hospital. She is already asking for her papa, it is going to be very hard being away from her Dad and sister. It is very hard for our family to be separated when our daughter is sick. Back in Victoria, the state is entering its 12th day of lockdown (I type from lockdown), and all eyes are on today’s numbers. Yesterday people were alarmed to see the state record 11 new locally acquired cases on Monday, fearing this would almost guarantee a third week of “stay-at-home orders”, but it was quickly clarified in the daily press conference that new cases are all close contacts of existing cases or people who are in quarantine, and there weren’t even any fresh exposure sites relating to these cases. We usually get word on the daily number before 9am, so I’ll keep you in the loop. In the meantime, if there is something you reckon I’ve missed or think should be in the blog but isn’t, shoot me a message on Twitter @MatildaBoseley or email me at matilda.boseley@theguardian.com.","charCount":"75986","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/luke-henriques-gomes\">Luke Henriques-Gomes</a> (now) and <a href=\"profile/matilda-boseley\">Matilda Boseley</a> (earlier)"},{"headline":"Dortmund plan to keep Haaland amid Chelsea interest but ready to sell Sancho","standfirst":"<ul><li>Club want £150m striker Haaland to stay for another season</li><li>Manchester United target Jadon Sancho can go for £77.5m</li></ul>","trailText":"Borussia Dortmund want to keep Erling Haaland for another season but will not stand in Jadon Sancho’s way if Manchester United pay £77.5m","byline":"Jacob Steinberg","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3c4274819b0ab7bf884df7841bf666c287c5844a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c4274819b0ab7bf884df7841bf666c287c5844a/0_71_3157_1895/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Erling Haaland has scored 57 goals for Borussia Dortmund since joining in January 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Erling Haaland has scored 57 goals for Borussia Dortmund since joining in January 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ina Fassbender/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Borussia Dortmund remain determined to keep Erling Haaland for another year despite Chelsea’s desire to sign the striker.</p> <p>Thomas Tuchel is keen to bring in a forward after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/may/29/manchester-city-chelsea-champions-league-final-match-report-kai-havertz\">winning the Champions League</a> and Chelsea are ready to ramp up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/apr/01/erling-haaland-agent-holds-barcelona-talks-manchester-city-chelsea-real-madrid-dortmund\">their interest in Haaland</a>.

In what is described as a “first order assessment”, scientists at CSIRO found it was theoretically possible to turn back the clock on the effect of decades of fossil fuel burning, but the radical step came with “as yet unquantified risks”. As well as causing the atmosphere and oceans to warm, increasing levels of CO2 in the atmosphere from fossil fuel burning has changed the pH of the ocean, making it harder for corals to form their skeletons – a process known as calcification. The lead scientist in the study, Dr Mathieu Mongin, said researchers were now being forced to consider the viability of radical interventions to save the reef because of a lack of global action on the climate crisis. One reef expert, Prof Terry Hughes, described the concept of adding materials to the Great Barrier Reef’s waters, as modelled in the study, as “reckless”. Reef scientists are exploring the viability a range of local interventions to try and buy time for the world’s largest coral reef system. A trial has already been carried out of a delivery system to spray trillions of nano-sized ocean salt crystals to brighten clouds, that could be deployed to cool the reef during summer periods when corals are at risk of bleaching. The new study, published Tuesday in the journal Environmental Research Letters, raises the concept of using an existing shipping route to deploy an alkaline material that could raise the pH level of the water, making it less acidic. The research used actual pH measurements taken from sensors on a ship owned by mining company Rio Tinto that travels the Weipa to Gladstone route – a journey that typically takes four days. Mongin and colleagues used those measurements to test and calibrate their computer model that simulated the material being released for two years using the ocean and weather conditions between January 2014 and December 2015. Mongin, a carbon chemist and modeller at CSIRO, said: “Because there is a lack of action on climate change and reducing emissions, that is forcing us to explore these interventions. “We have to explore all the caveats and that will have to be done with our scientific colleagues and reef managers.” The study looks at the potential affects of adding a solution of crushed Olivine – a common mineral – at a rate of 90,000t over three days.

While the pH levels of the water naturally swing back and forth daily, and across the seasons, one study has found the highest levels of CO2 the Great Barrier Reef’s corals were exposed to in the 1960s now represented the lowest levels. Dr Katharina Fabricius, a senior principal research scientist at the Australian Institute of Marine Science, said: “Overall it’s clear that reef calcification has declined. “The GBR has become 6% more acidic in the last 10 years.

There are whole essays on Reddit fuming<strong> </strong>about “Elmo voices” and “drunk robots”. But this is what rap is: relentlessly in search of the next, newest thing, and in the process evolving not just language but the human voice. To try to make sense of this process and where “the squeak” has come from, we asked professional rap coach and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/HowToRapDrew\">“How to Rap” YouTuber Drew Morisey</a> and voice analyst Dr Calbert Graham of the University of Cambridge Language Sciences Centre to listen to some of the most distinctive voices in 40 years of hip-hop history, and chart the way rap’s tone of voice has evolved over that time.</p> <h2>Funky 4 + 1 <br>That’s the Joint (1980)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Funky 4+1\">  <iframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/4E3ODD0mMJZ7iCddYGNZnS\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"></iframe> </figure>  <p><strong>A classic posse cut, straight from hip-hop’s birthplace in the south Bronx and the first ever signed rap group</strong></p> <p><strong>Drew Morisey</strong> I always ask: what is the context, and what is the technology used? And this is from DJ culture at discos and block parties. The delivery in the late 70s and 80s is a very announcer-like voice, very good for hosting a party: “Heyy, let’s have fun, everybody over here, everybody over there,” quite choreographed. The choice of intonation in that era was primarily dictated by the crowd’s interest in the music. It was party music, straight up.</p> <p><strong>Dr Calbert Graham</strong> There’s a very compelling rhythm that’s from disco, jazz and funk. The 1-2-3-4 ostinato of the accompaniment is steady, all the syncopation is in the vocal part. Overall it’s compelling, it’s genial. The language, articulation and use of phonetics to build a rhythm is kind of encouraging you along with it.</p> <h2>Beastie Boys<br>Time to Get Ill (1986)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Beastie Boys\">  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TQFWc4syEgM\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p><strong>In which Def Jam fully launched the notion of rap stars as rock groups</strong></p> <p><strong>DM</strong> With Def Jam folks like Beastie Boys and Run DMC, the music consciously avoids melody in the beats: just one chord with these guitar stabs. It allows the vocals to carry the melody, the ups and downs, the divergence of voices. The shouted style really became the norm right through the 80s with rap becoming successful and more competitive.</p> <p><strong>CG</strong> The first impression is of shouting with abandon, but there’s an audible creak – a deeper tone at the back of the vocal tract – while one of them has a very audible nasal quality which penetrates through. They shift between nasal, falsetto and chest voice. The skill here is how the voices contrast with each other, how the different aspects of voice interact – it’s very playful.</p> <h2>Snoop Dogg<br>Gin &amp; Juice (1994)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Snoop\">  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fWCZse1iwE0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p><strong>With the spotlight swinging from NYC to the west coast, a whole new level of funkiness arises</strong></p> <p><strong>DM</strong> Dr Dre, production-wise, reintroduced melodic chord structures. It led a more subtly melodic voice like Snoop to sound good; he might not have sounded so dynamic on those Beastie Boys anti-melody-type beats. He uses lots of repetition to make it sing-songy and kind of seductive. There’s a whole world-building thing, he’s fulfilling a character which we in the community would already have known from books like Iceberg Slim, or as an archetype in the streets.</p> <p><strong>CG</strong> It’s a very soft and reflective delivery; early on there’s a teenager-like tone but then the rest of the track is lower in pitch using a full tenor chest voice. It’s conversational, but with these little pauses – “may I … kick a little … something for the … Gs, yeah …” there’s a sense of someone very much in control.</p> <h2>Busta Rhymes<br>Everything Remains Raw (1996)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Busta Rhyme\">  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/x3qbmQcimWE\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p><strong>Playing on his Jamaican heritage, Busta embodies the rapper as berserker</strong></p> <p><strong>DM</strong> Busta is one who grew up with the culture of the cypher: close-up, competitive rapping. To control a room, just standing on a cafeteria table without a microphone, competing against guys who’d become Jay-Z and Biggie, you need to be the loudest, the most fantastical, the most performative – like Redman or DMX, too. The other thing here is the use of doubles: recording a second take of vocals where he backs up certain words, like his own hype man. This is again technology affecting how the voice sounds.</p> <p><strong>CG</strong> This reminds me so much of Jamaican dancehall, with its high vocal intensity. It’s incredibly complex, almost singing in style, with this breakneck speed. It’s so technical. The consonants are well articulated, the vowels are short, and this perhaps signals self-monitoring and thought to the style. Like dancehall, it’s imposing control on chaos.</p> <h2>Dizzee Rascal<br>I Luv U (2003)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"I Luv U\">  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YH0KWX2a8zY\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p><strong>The explosion of grime into the mainstream makes British accents confidently define rap styles for the first time</strong></p> <p><strong>DM</strong> This is oddly conversational. His voice is squeaking “WHAT you TALKIN’ ’bout THIS for”. It’s not clean, it feels real. Also these very basic, computerised notes, like the Def Jam stuff, leave more space for vocal variation, so he can be very expressive. One thing I coach rappers in is that the simpler the beat, the more you can do fun things with your voice.</p> <p><strong>CG</strong> This one is really interesting with its frequent transition into falsetto voice with relative ease. The consonants are not particularly strong, and there’s no audible creak, which gives a surprising softness to it even though it’s angry. It would be interesting to study in detail how the British experience creates different tones from Americans.</p> <h2>Bone Crusher<br>Never Scared (2003)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Never Scared\">  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ryIjCkw3Jfg\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p><strong>The south takes over: at the peak of Atlanta crunk, Bone Crusher’s Hulk-like roar could be heard from coast to coast</strong></p> <p><strong>DM</strong> Another technological shift: voices are layered on the chorus to make it sound like a large crowd is singing along, leading the audience to think: “I should sing along with this.” That was very common in this era of rap – Kanye, Nelly, Lil Jon, Ja Rule. And with crunk in general, again we go to the question of context and purpose: its home base in Atlanta is the strip club. “IT’S FRIIIDAY NIGHT, EVERYBODY: SHOTS!” So Lil Jon or Bone Crusher, their voices are gonna sound really good in strip club with ice shaking and money everywhere. It’s loud, it’s exciting.</p> <p><strong>CG</strong> This is super performative. A bass/baritone voice, with a very raspy timbre, projects an imposing physical presence. This is really a super-direct statement of power, strength and being in control; it’s very interesting to contrast that with Snoop who does the same thing in a completely different way.</p> <h2>Giggs<br>The Last Straw (2008)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Giggs\">  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uuTXLcF_xIA\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p><strong>The epitome of London “road rap”: Peckham’s finest calmly lays out his beef with MTV, 1Xtra and anyone else who might have crossed him</strong></p> <p><strong>DM</strong> The lineage of the way Giggs is delivering on this song is like Cam’ron and Dipset and their street mixtapes. He’s starting from this almost bored tone. But saying such fierce things in this voice makes it more menacing. 50 Cent is another example: not his hits, but the street tracks of the 2000s; he delivers things in a very even, regular-man voice, while saying he’ll kill you.</p> <p><strong>CG</strong> It’s very conversational, very low in pitch – I’d suspect lower than his normal speaking voice – but the closest we’ve heard to normal speaking patterns. The combination of the pitch, the pace and well-articulated consonants give him this haunting, detached delivery. It’s really interesting to hear a black British voice that is so plainly cockney, too, with almost no Caribbean or other influence on the phrasing or tone.</p> <h2>Kanye West ft Nicki Minaj<br>Monster (2010)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Monster\">  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pS6HRKZQLFA\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p><strong>Even next to the biggest egos on the planet, the Trinidad-born Minaj not only holds her own in her guest verse but dominates completely</strong></p> <p><strong>DM</strong> If you want to understand Nicki’s interest in different accents, shifting high pitch to low, you want to look directly at Eminem’s first couple of albums; taking that use of characters and running with it. Lil Wayne is important here, too. In his mid-2000s mixtapes he’d change his voice every four bars, with the beat change. He has super control over it. A definite Caribbean influence here: Nicki is from Trinidad, Wayne is from New Orleans which has a huge Caribbean population.</p> <p><strong>CG</strong> This verse might be short but it’s so intense. The control in the switching of tones makes it very firm, compelling, domineering. There’s these very pronounced consonants, a bit of extra lengthening of tones; when she crescendos, her voice gets more creak and that’s all clearly very conscious.</p> <h2>Young MA<br>OOOUUU (2016)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Young MA\">  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gVf_4Ns3qLU\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p><strong>The Jamaican/Puerto Rican/Brooklyn MC demonstrates her uncompromising deadpanning on this quadruple-platinum single</strong></p> <p><strong>DM</strong> Hear the way she draws out words: “bro code”, “low blow”, “no-no” become the melody in the absence of an actual strong note. It’s something I overtly teach students: let the beat breathe, find places to stretch out words; that’s where you have fun with it. On records now, too, since the mid-2000s, we’re a long way from live performance defining the style; you can cut together multiple takes in the studio, and finesse and experiment with the emotion of your voice. It’s more like cutting together a movie than one take all the way through.</p> <p><strong>CG</strong> This is a deep voice, with what seems like a very narrow pitch range. The lengthening vowels and also a use of descending pitch are both simulating inebriation, and also a sense of gloom and detachment, but at the same time it’s smooth and controlled. You can hear Latin heritage strongly in the vowels and also in the softened consonants, sometimes to the point where Cs and Ts are not realised at all.</p> <h2>645AR<br>Pray (2020)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Pray\">  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mbYoTL7SW0w\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p><strong>And so to the squeak: funky, hallucinatory and deeply weird</strong></p> <p><strong>DM</strong> This is pretty extreme, but what’s happening in the world of rap, as with so much culture, is we’re becoming a decentralised content structure; a lot of niche fame as opposed to popular fame. You can be a rapper with only 100,000 fans, but still make a bag of money because of how social media works. This means it’s harder and harder to say “rap is like this”. You have your Drakes of the world, but for every one of them there’s someone unique who doesn’t have Top 20 hits but still makes a good living.</p> <p><strong>CG</strong> This sounds almost like a human synthesiser. Obviously he uses a lot of falsetto, the highest notes sound like they’re made by tensing the thyroid muscles so the vocal cords are shortened. I wouldn’t imagine a musician would say that’s the proper way of producing a falsetto, so it’s innovative! Hip-hop has always been about vocal creativity, and that’s what’s happening here: phonetically, he’s rapping.

His lyrics may cover fierce street narratives and narcotic meanderings, but his vocal style is more Minnie Mouse than Migos. And he has fully committed to the bit: “the squeak”, as he’s happy to call it, is present throughout his discography to date and has earned him huge streaming numbers and an FKA twigs collaboration. He is not even the only squeak rapper; he has a predecessor in alien falsetto in Houston’s Voochie P. Of course, this riles the “real hip-hop” Grandpa Simpsons, who still haven’t got over the slurring and Auto-Tune of Future, Young Thug and co. There are whole essays on Reddit fuming about “Elmo voices” and “drunk robots”. But this is what rap is: relentlessly in search of the next, newest thing, and in the process evolving not just language but the human voice. To try to make sense of this process and where “the squeak” has come from, we asked professional rap coach and “How to Rap” YouTuber Drew Morisey and voice analyst Dr Calbert Graham of the University of Cambridge Language Sciences Centre to listen to some of the most distinctive voices in 40 years of hip-hop history, and chart the way rap’s tone of voice has evolved over that time. Funky 4 + 1 That’s the Joint (1980) A classic posse cut, straight from hip-hop’s birthplace in the south Bronx and the first ever signed rap group Drew Morisey I always ask: what is the context, and what is the technology used? And this is from DJ culture at discos and block parties. The delivery in the late 70s and 80s is a very announcer-like voice, very good for hosting a party: “Heyy, let’s have fun, everybody over here, everybody over there,” quite choreographed. The choice of intonation in that era was primarily dictated by the crowd’s interest in the music. It was party music, straight up. Dr Calbert Graham There’s a very compelling rhythm that’s from disco, jazz and funk. The 1-2-3-4 ostinato of the accompaniment is steady, all the syncopation is in the vocal part. Overall it’s compelling, it’s genial. The language, articulation and use of phonetics to build a rhythm is kind of encouraging you along with it. Beastie Boys Time to Get Ill (1986) In which Def Jam fully launched the notion of rap stars as rock groups DM With Def Jam folks like Beastie Boys and Run DMC, the music consciously avoids melody in the beats: just one chord with these guitar stabs. It allows the vocals to carry the melody, the ups and downs, the divergence of voices. The shouted style really became the norm right through the 80s with rap becoming successful and more competitive. CG The first impression is of shouting with abandon, but there’s an audible creak – a deeper tone at the back of the vocal tract – while one of them has a very audible nasal quality which penetrates through. They shift between nasal, falsetto and chest voice. The skill here is how the voices contrast with each other, how the different aspects of voice interact – it’s very playful. Snoop Dogg Gin &amp; Juice (1994) With the spotlight swinging from NYC to the west coast, a whole new level of funkiness arises DM Dr Dre, production-wise, reintroduced melodic chord structures. It led a more subtly melodic voice like Snoop to sound good; he might not have sounded so dynamic on those Beastie Boys anti-melody-type beats. He uses lots of repetition to make it sing-songy and kind of seductive. There’s a whole world-building thing, he’s fulfilling a character which we in the community would already have known from books like Iceberg Slim, or as an archetype in the streets. CG It’s a very soft and reflective delivery; early on there’s a teenager-like tone but then the rest of the track is lower in pitch using a full tenor chest voice. It’s conversational, but with these little pauses – “may I … kick a little … something for the … Gs, yeah …” there’s a sense of someone very much in control. Busta Rhymes Everything Remains Raw (1996) Playing on his Jamaican heritage, Busta embodies the rapper as berserker DM Busta is one who grew up with the culture of the cypher: close-up, competitive rapping. To control a room, just standing on a cafeteria table without a microphone, competing against guys who’d become Jay-Z and Biggie, you need to be the loudest, the most fantastical, the most performative – like Redman or DMX, too.

If it’s not only the plays but also the preshow buzz, interval chatter with friends and postshow discussions then you’re not alone. <a href=\"https://pitlochryfestivaltheatre.com/news/pitlochry-festival-theatre-and-royal-lyceum-theatre-edinburgh-launch-sound-stage/\">Sound Stage</a> is a new digital initiative from Pitlochry Festival theatre and the Royal Lyceum in collaboration with Naked Productions.

This devastating series of dramatised readings, directed by Graham McLaren and Neil Murray, gives voice to those experiences, with testimonies – and extracts from the report – read on stage by actors and some of the survivors themselves. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tficNm7xcRE\">Available until 17 July</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/mar/18/home-voice-irish-mother-baby-homes-survivors\">Read more</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a40c40faa91d60331bae56525c22bdae952e9ab6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a40c40faa91d60331bae56525c22bdae952e9ab6/0_100_1500_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jess Kavanagh in Home: Part One, reading an extract from the Final Report of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jess Kavanagh in Home: Part One, reading an extract from the Final Report of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ste Murray</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>BBC Lights Up</h2> <p>The BBC’s virtual theatre festival offers 18 newly recorded productions for TV, radio and online.

Now it’s a 60-minute film that unfolds in and around the murderous couple’s bed. Charlene Boyd and Keith Fleming reprise their roles. <a href=\"https://www.citz.co.uk/whatson/info/the-macbeths-online-streaming\">Until 30 June</a>.</p> <h2>Barnes’ People</h2> <p>He is best known for The Ruling Class but many of Peter Barnes’s plays are overdue a revival; so here’s an attractive proposition from Original Theatre Company and Perfectly Normal Productions. It’s a set of four monologues Barnes wrote for Radio 3 in the 80s and includes True Born Englishman, about a Buckingham Palace footman, which was never aired by the BBC and now gets its world premiere.

It’s performed by Ryan Price at Theatre503 in London in 2018, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVZk-6K3IM\">filmed by My Reel Productions</a>, before the show went on an acclaimed UK tour.</p> <h2>Northern Ballet</h2> <p>Yorkshire’s high-flying ballet company presents a pay-what-you-can <a href=\"https://northernballet.com/digital-dance/pay-as-you-can-digital-season\">digital season</a> including short new premieres and the full version of Cathy Marston’s acclaimed regal spectacular Victoria. Choreographer Kenneth Tindall and film-maker Dan Lowenstein collaborate on Northern Lights, which brings dancers to the streets of Leeds, and Tindall’s Have Your Cake takes inspiration from the nation baking banana bread in lockdown. Ballet Black’s Mthuthuzeli November presents What Used To, No Longer Is, choreographed and created entirely remotely.</p> <h2>National Theatre at Home</h2> <p>After the success of its weekly Thursday night streams during lockdown, the NT launched a <a href=\"https://www.ntathome.com/browse\">catalogue of past hits</a> online.

New plays are added to the collection each month.</p> <h2>Uncle Vanya</h2> <p>Ian Rickson’s indelible production of Chekhov’s masterpiece, in a new version by Conor McPherson, was a West End sensation at the start of 2020. After it closed early due to the pandemic, Rickson and producer Sonia Friedman reunited most of the cast for this innovative filmed version. Each performance rings true – from Toby Jones in the title role to Aimee Lou Wood’s Sonya, Richard Armitage’s Astrov and the always excellent Rosalind Eleazar as Yelena. And Bruno Poet’s lighting and Rae Smith’s set design combine to spellbinding effect. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000qplz\">On BBC iPlayer</a>.</p> <h2>Earwig</h2> <p>With the stage out of bounds, theatre-makers are devising ever more creative sonic experiments to be enjoyed at home.

Now, the acclaimed play by Ryan Calais Cameron has been turned into a film directed by Anastasia Osei-Kuffour. It explores, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/aug/12/play-about-christopher-alders-death-to-be-turned-into-film\">says the playwright</a>, “the negotiations that black people need to make in order to do things that seem simple to others”. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/feb/25/typical-review-richard-blackwood-christopher-alder\">Read the five-star review</a>.</p> <h2>The Inquest</h2> <p>Fancy solving a crime from your sofa? This piece of puzzle theatre invites audiences to crack clues with strangers – or you can arrange a private show to team up with your pals. Viewers turned jurors are presented with a tangled web of evidence from a cold case and assisted through their deliberations by the performers Joe Ball (as a coroner) and Tom Black (as a police archivist). It’s the second creation from <a href=\"https://www.jurygames.com/the-inquest-home\">Jury Games</a> whose debut, Jury Duty, is still available online. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/jan/27/the-inquest-review-cold-case-mystery-jury-games\">Read the full review</a>.</p> <h2>Myths and Adventures from Ancient Greece</h2> <p>If home-schooling feels like opening a Pandora’s box, well, here’s a fun way to help your kids engage with the Greek myths on the curriculum. Hannah Khalil has created new versions of the tales of Pandora, Persephone, King Midas and Theseus and the Minotaur. They’re intended for those aged three to eight but will appeal to older viewers, too. Available <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZvJ49nF0XmZ8yY89ZpLh3TDET6Uyuxfk\">on YouTube from Waterman’s Arts Centre</a>, they are staged by the director Ian Nicholson and designer Sam Wilde, who brightened up lockdown with their delightful puppet versions of the picture books I Want My Hat Back and <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/471343772?utm_campaign=5370367&amp;utm_source=affiliate&amp;utm_channel=affiliate&amp;cjevent=aca2c6135b0d11eb82d004240a180513#at=178\">Shh! We Have a Plan</a>.</p> <h2>Shipwreck</h2> <p>First staged at the Almeida in 2019, Shipwreck by Anne “Mr Burns” Washburn gave a sprawling account of modern-day American politics and the rise and potential fall of Trump. It was due to be staged at the Public theatre in New York in 2020 but was instead adapted by Saheem Ali as a <a href=\"https://publictheater.org/productions/season/fall-2020/shipwreck/\">three-part audio play</a> in a co-production with Woolly Mammoth theatre company. Set during a getaway for a bunch of friends in upstate New York in 2017, it’s a knotty appraisal of an American moment that, strikingly, already feels like a vanishing era.</p> <h2>What the Constitution Means to Me</h2> <p>Heidi Schreck’s phenomenal Broadway show has received <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/oct/20/what-the-constitution-means-to-me-review-dazzling-shocking-america-indictment\">five-star reviews</a> from Guardian critics on both sides of the Atlantic. Now available to stream <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/What-Constitution-Means-Me/dp/B08KRFX3ZG\">from Amazon</a>, it charts what the supreme law of the US has meant to generations of women, as Schreck recreates the debating competitions she took part in as a teenager. Directed by Marielle Heller, it’s shatteringly funny, deeply disturbing yet imbued with optimism.</p> <h2>The Cost of Living</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9c0283657f01b0964975c05fc66e842cc93480a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9c0283657f01b0964975c05fc66e842cc93480a2/110_0_1640_984/1000.jpg\" alt=\"DV8’s The Cost of Living.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">DV8’s The Cost of Living.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As a tribute to the acclaimed disabled dancer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/oct/28/david-toole-obituary\">David Toole</a>, who died in October, the physical theatre company DV8 have shared their multi-award-winning 2004 film The Cost of Living <a href=\"https://www.dv8.co.uk/projects/archive/the-cost-of-living--film\">online</a>. Shot on location at a faded seaside resort in Norfolk, it follows two street performers (Toole and Eddie Kay) in a portrait of friendship and prejudice, brimming with spellbinding images. Available on DV8’s Media Portal for a small membership fee. Unmissable.</p> <h2>Pippin</h2> <p>They’ve got magic to do, just for you: the original 1980 Broadway production of the Tony award-winning musical, with catchy songs by Stephen Schwartz and some glorious moves by Bob Fosse, is available to stream on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Pippin-Ben-Vereen/dp/B07RX2HFSR\">Amazon</a>. Ben Vereen is the beguiling leading player of a troupe who may or may not lead the eponymous prince to self-immolation. It’s bizarre and frequently frustrating, but a fascinating chapter of Broadway history.

Why not do the same for theatre – and why not start with some of the York Mystery Plays, which date back to the 1300s? Four of the biblical dramas, including the story of Adam and Eve, have been <a href=\"https://www.yorktheatreroyal.co.uk/be-part-of-it/collective-acts/the-york-mystery-plays-radio-broadcast/\">adapted for BBC radio</a>, with a cast of community and professional actors for York Theatre Royal’s <a href=\"https://www.yorktheatreroyal.co.uk/be-part-of-it/collective-acts/\">Collective Acts</a> project.</p> <h2>An American in Paris</h2> <p>Feted at the Châtelet in Paris in 2014, Christopher Wheeldon’s resplendent staging of the Gershwins’ classic went on to conquer Broadway and the West End. It’s available on a new streaming platform, <a href=\"http://stage2view.com/\">Stage2View.com</a>, which also offers the musicals Kinky Boots and 42nd Street, as well as Michael Grandage’s Mark Rothko drama Red, starring Alfred Molina as the artist.</p> <h2>User Not Found</h2> <p>When we die, what becomes of our digital identity? Do all those tweets and posts endure for eternity – and who decides? The site-specific theatre company Dante or Die asked such questions, and many more, in a thoughtful and funny 2018 show by Chris Goode that was staged in cafes. It has now been reimagined as a 50-minute video podcast, available from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/aug/24/this-digital-afterlife-mobile-phone-based-show-connects-us-in-our-grief-user-not-found-dante-or-die\">the Guardian</a> until 31 March 2022.</p> <h2>Flight Paths</h2> <p>This production by the theatre company Extant celebrates the rich history of Goze, itinerant blind performers who traditionally travelled around Japan to bring audiences a vast selection of stories – accompanied by music played on their shamisen stringed instruments. <a href=\"https://flightpaths.extant.org.uk/\">Flight Paths</a> fuses old and new, bringing together archive material about the Goze, animation and filmed modern performance, in an accessible hour-long digital experience.</p> <h2>good dog</h2> <p>Arinzé Kene’s poetic 2017 play good dog posed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/feb/09/arinze-kene-play-good-dog-uk-riots-2011-interview\">unanswered questions</a> about the UK’s summer riots of 2011. Revived for a tour last year, it has now been adapted as a superb <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9K_QH3p3zI&amp;feature=emb_title\">20-minute film</a>, directed by Andrew Gillman and Natalie Ibu for <a href=\"http://www.tiatafahodzi.com/featured/good-dog-the-film/\">Tiata Fahodzi</a>. Anton Cross stars as a man looking back on his youth, his neighbours and his community. The film was commissioned by The Space and supported by the BBC and Arts Council England.</p> <h2>Charlotte Holmes: Adventure Box</h2> <p>Lockdown restrictions and cancelled travel plans have narrowed horizons for little adventurers. So this “seven-day theatrical experience” for families is both a delight and a relief. Created by Huddersfield’s <a href=\"https://thelbt.org/get-involved/charlotte-holmes/\">Lawrence Batley theatre</a>, <a href=\"https://dukeslancaster.org/charlotte-holmes-adventure-box\">the Dukes in Lancaster</a> and theatre producers <a href=\"https://www.thebigtiny.co.uk/\">the Big Tiny</a>, it’s a series of mysteries encountered by Charlotte, a young girl evacuated to Yorkshire during the second world war. You solve the puzzles by watching jaunty online videos and opening up the envelopes and parcels inside an adventure box sent to you in the post when you book. The Big Tiny’s follow-up, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/jan/05/balthazar-snapdragon-adventure-box-review-magical-distractions\">Balthazar Snapdragon</a>, is just as fun. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/aug/12/charlotte-holmes-adventure-box-review\">Read the full review</a>.</p> <h2>Hamilton</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8e2580bb72a3440eb4647dafec9053347db34367\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e2580bb72a3440eb4647dafec9053347db34367/0_6_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lin-Manuel Miranda and Phillipa Soo in Hamilton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lin-Manuel Miranda and Phillipa Soo in Hamilton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lin-Manuel Miranda’s phenomenal, Pulitzer prize-winning musical about the “10-dollar founding father without a father” was filmed over three nights in New York in 2016 with the original Broadway cast.

Its growing collection of short films is designed to offer audiences “hope and joy”. There’s Brian Cox as Ian Rankin’s Edinburgh detective John Rebus, Two Doors Down’s Jonathan Watson as a shipyard electrician suffering from exposure to asbestos, and Kate Dickie as brilliant as ever in a monologue by Jenni Fagan. The lineup of Scottish talent is extraordinary – Tam Dean Burn, Rona Munro and Douglas Henshall all contribute – and don’t miss Janey Godley’s two-hander with her adorable sausage dog. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/may/27/scenes-for-survival-review-brian-cox-zoom-inspector-rebus-national-theatre-of-scotland\">Read the full review</a>.</p> <h2>Matthew Bourne’s The Red Shoes</h2> <p>One of the major dance productions cut short by the coronavirus crisis was Matthew Bourne’s tour of The Red Shoes, his rapturously received version of the Powell and Pressburger film.

Scott performed the play at the Bush in 2008 and it was a hot ticket when he reprised it at the Old Vic 10 years later. This version was shot in a single take in 2011. Directed by Stephens and Andrew Porter, it is available <a href=\"http://www.seawallandrewscott.com/buy-sea-wall-film-starring-andrew-scott/\">online to buy</a>. Brace yourself.</p> <h2>I Wish I Was a Mountain</h2> <p>With wonder, wit and sophisticated storytelling, performance poet Toby Thompson creates a beautiful show for over-sevens. Thompson steps in and out of his version of Hermann Hesse’s fairytale Faldum, riffing with the young audience and spinning a handful of jazz LPs. <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/401349317\">I Wish I Was a Mountain</a> embraces big questions about time and contentment. This is a short but profound show, directed by Lee Lyford, hatched by the Egg theatre’s <a href=\"https://www.theatreroyal.org.uk/take-part/artist-development/about/\">Incubator</a> development programme and cleverly designed by Anisha Fields. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/sep/24/i-wish-i-was-a-mountain-review-toby-thompson-hermann-hesse-the-egg-bath\">Read the full review</a>.</p> <h2>Lyric theatre in Belfast</h2> <p>Belfast’s Lyric had to cancel its co-production of 1984 with Bruiser Theatre Company but instead launched the initiative New Speak: Re-imagined, in which Northern Irish talents including Amadan Ensemble, Dominic Montague and Katie Richardson respond to the lockdown crisis.

Performed by a cast of six including the phenomenal Shelley Eva Haden. Available until 30 June. Read the full review.

Touchy Originally designed as a gig-theatre stage show before the pandemic, this project from 20 Stories High was commissioned by the Wellcome Collection to explore the importance of touch for young people. The theme took on new resonance in our world of social distancing and the show has spawned five homemade short films instead, created by emerging Liverpool artists. The films are released weekly, with the complete series available on 10 June.

Not everyone feels able to talk about it but Fran Bushe put her experiences centre-stage with Ad Libido, a solo comedy theatre show about the problems she had with desire, orgasm and pain during sex.

Sound Stage What do you miss about theatre? If it’s not only the plays but also the preshow buzz, interval chatter with friends and postshow discussions then you’re not alone. Sound Stage is a new digital initiative from Pitlochry Festival theatre and the Royal Lyceum in collaboration with Naked Productions. It aims to recreate elements of the social experience of theatregoing, complete with a virtual bar where visitors can mingle.

Uncle Vanya Ian Rickson’s indelible production of Chekhov’s masterpiece, in a new version by Conor McPherson, was a West End sensation at the start of 2020. After it closed early due to the pandemic, Rickson and producer Sonia Friedman reunited most of the cast for this innovative filmed version. Each performance rings true – from Toby Jones in the title role to Aimee Lou Wood’s Sonya, Richard Armitage’s Astrov and the always excellent Rosalind Eleazar as Yelena. And Bruno Poet’s lighting and Rae Smith’s set design combine to spellbinding effect. On BBC iPlayer.

The Inquest Fancy solving a crime from your sofa? This piece of puzzle theatre invites audiences to crack clues with strangers – or you can arrange a private show to team up with your pals.

Myths and Adventures from Ancient Greece If home-schooling feels like opening a Pandora’s box, well, here’s a fun way to help your kids engage with the Greek myths on the curriculum. Hannah Khalil has created new versions of the tales of Pandora, Persephone, King Midas and Theseus and the Minotaur. They’re intended for those aged three to eight but will appeal to older viewers, too. Available on YouTube from Waterman’s Arts Centre, they are staged by the director Ian Nicholson and designer Sam Wilde, who brightened up lockdown with their delightful puppet versions of the picture books I Want My Hat Back and Shh! We Have a Plan. Shipwreck First staged at the Almeida in 2019, Shipwreck by Anne “Mr Burns” Washburn gave a sprawling account of modern-day American politics and the rise and potential fall of Trump. It was due to be staged at the Public theatre in New York in 2020 but was instead adapted by Saheem Ali as a three-part audio play in a co-production with Woolly Mammoth theatre company. Set during a getaway for a bunch of friends in upstate New York in 2017, it’s a knotty appraisal of an American moment that, strikingly, already feels like a vanishing era. What the Constitution Means to Me Heidi Schreck’s phenomenal Broadway show has received five-star reviews from Guardian critics on both sides of the Atlantic. Now available to stream from Amazon, it charts what the supreme law of the US has meant to generations of women, as Schreck recreates the debating competitions she took part in as a teenager.

Pippin They’ve got magic to do, just for you: the original 1980 Broadway production of the Tony award-winning musical, with catchy songs by Stephen Schwartz and some glorious moves by Bob Fosse, is available to stream on Amazon. Ben Vereen is the beguiling leading player of a troupe who may or may not lead the eponymous prince to self-immolation. It’s bizarre and frequently frustrating, but a fascinating chapter of Broadway history. Get the backstage view in the series Fosse/Verdon on BBC iPlayer. The York Mystery Plays This pandemic year has seen a boom in sales for classic fiction as we finally get round to reading famous “bucket list” novels. Why not do the same for theatre – and why not start with some of the York Mystery Plays, which date back to the 1300s? Four of the biblical dramas, including the story of Adam and Eve, have been adapted for BBC radio, with a cast of community and professional actors for York Theatre Royal’s Collective Acts project. An American in Paris Feted at the Châtelet in Paris in 2014, Christopher Wheeldon’s resplendent staging of the Gershwins’ classic went on to conquer Broadway and the West End.

It has now been reimagined as a 50-minute video podcast, available from the Guardian until 31 March 2022. Flight Paths This production by the theatre company Extant celebrates the rich history of Goze, itinerant blind performers who traditionally travelled around Japan to bring audiences a vast selection of stories – accompanied by music played on their shamisen stringed instruments. Flight Paths fuses old and new, bringing together archive material about the Goze, animation and filmed modern performance, in an accessible hour-long digital experience. good dog Arinzé Kene’s poetic 2017 play good dog posed unanswered questions about the UK’s summer riots of 2011. Revived for a tour last year, it has now been adapted as a superb 20-minute film, directed by Andrew Gillman and Natalie Ibu for Tiata Fahodzi. Anton Cross stars as a man looking back on his youth, his neighbours and his community. The film was commissioned by The Space and supported by the BBC and Arts Council England. Charlotte Holmes: Adventure Box Lockdown restrictions and cancelled travel plans have narrowed horizons for little adventurers. So this “seven-day theatrical experience” for families is both a delight and a relief. Created by Huddersfield’s Lawrence Batley theatre, the Dukes in Lancaster and theatre producers the Big Tiny, it’s a series of mysteries encountered by Charlotte, a young girl evacuated to Yorkshire during the second world war. You solve the puzzles by watching jaunty online videos and opening up the envelopes and parcels inside an adventure box sent to you in the post when you book. The Big Tiny’s follow-up, Balthazar Snapdragon, is just as fun. Read the full review. Hamilton Lin-Manuel Miranda’s phenomenal, Pulitzer prize-winning musical about the “10-dollar founding father without a father” was filmed over three nights in New York in 2016 with the original Broadway cast. Slated for a 2021 cinema release, it was instead fast-tracked on to the Disney+ streaming service. It’s directed by Thomas Kail, who staged the musical, and according to Miranda gives “everyone the best seat in the house”. Watch it once and, to quote Jonathan Groff’s frothing King George III, You’ll Be Back. Read the full, five-star review. As Waters Rise Ben Weatherill’s play is set in the year 2025 when a flood has left Britain in a state of emergency. Originally planned for a stage production, it is now a three-part audio drama directed by Alex Brown and featuring teenage actors from the Almeida Young Company, who recorded their parts in isolation during lockdown. Released as part of Shifting Tides, the Almeida’s digital festival about the climate emergency, aimed at and created with 14- to 25-year-olds. Read the full review.

First, Do No Harm Sharon D Clarke has portrayed a long line of memorable characters but this is something else. In a new short play by Bernardine Evaristo, directed by Adrian Lester, Clarke speaks for the National Health Service and those who work for it, reflecting on the NHS’s past and future. As she proudly says: “I am one of the best things that has ever happened.” First, Do No Harm is part of a series celebrating the NHS entitled The Greatest Wealth, curated for the Old Vic by Lolita Chakrabarti. The Old Vic is also pioneering socially distanced live performances and rehearsed readings as well as archive recordings of past productions. Nine Lives Slam poet and playwright Zodwa Nyoni was born in Zimbabwe and grew up in Yorkshire. The locations are combined in her vivid 2016 monologue, in which Lladel Bryant plays Ishmael, a young gay Zimbabwean who flees homophobic violence in his home country and seeks asylum in the UK where he is dispersed to Leeds. Alex Chisholm’s hour-long production, available on YouTube, was recorded at the Arcola theatre in London. The Lord Chamberlain’s Men The all-male theatre company, known for touring open-air Shakespeare productions around the UK, has postponed its Macbeth until next year but shared two past productions on YouTube and on their website: The Tempest, staged in 2018, and A Midsummer Night’s Dream, presented last year to mark the company’s 15th birthday. They encourage you to recreate the spirit of their productions at home – “whether it is on a picnic blanket in your living room or under the stars wrapped up warm” – and share the results on social media. Richard II Quite simply one of 2019’s most celebrated and momentous stagings of Shakespeare. Adjoa Andoh stars as Richard and co-directs, with Lynette Linton, a superb cast entirely comprising women of colour including Shobna Gulati and Ayesha Dharker. An English history play vividly staged for today in the Globe’s candlelit Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, perfect for a play full of plotting. Available on YouTube.

Some catchup videos are available on YouTube. Read the full review.

Scenes for Survival The National Theatre of Scotland was among the first theatres to announce a lockdown programme of work responding to the pandemic. Its growing collection of short films is designed to offer audiences “hope and joy”. There’s Brian Cox as Ian Rankin’s Edinburgh detective John Rebus, Two Doors Down’s Jonathan Watson as a shipyard electrician suffering from exposure to asbestos, and Kate Dickie as brilliant as ever in a monologue by Jenni Fagan. The lineup of Scottish talent is extraordinary – Tam Dean Burn, Rona Munro and Douglas Henshall all contribute – and don’t miss Janey Godley’s two-hander with her adorable sausage dog. Read the full review. Matthew Bourne’s The Red Shoes One of the major dance productions cut short by the coronavirus crisis was Matthew Bourne’s tour of The Red Shoes, his rapturously received version of the Powell and Pressburger film. But a recording of the sumptuous stage performance made at Sadler’s Wells, starring Ashley Shaw in the role made famous by Moira Shearer, is available on BBC iPlayer. Bourne’s company New Adventures has also unveiled a charming 12-minute film version, performed by the cast from home – among children’s toys in their living rooms, on tables, in gardens and backyards, and in the kitchen. The costumes include football kits and, in one case, a couple of towels. Pass Over Antoinette Nwandu’s blistering, Beckettian play about police brutality was filmed at Chicago’s Steppenwolf theatre by Spike Lee for this 75-minute version, which crackles with humour, tension and tragedy. Lee skilfully weaves the audience, and the world outside the theatre, into a work that our critic Arifa Akbar gives five stars. Available on Amazon Prime. Read the full review. Unprecedented How’s this for a lineup? The cast includes Katherine Parkinson, Paterson Joseph and Denise Gough. The writers include James Graham, Jasmine Lee-Jones, Prasanna Puwanarajah and April De Angelis. And Ned Bennett, Blanche McIntyre, Ola Ince and Tinuke Craig are among the directors. Headlong and Century Films have assembled an extraordinarily talented gang for their 14 short films about lockdown life. On BBC iPlayer. Read the review. Sea Wall “She had us, both of us, absolutely round her finger …” From that first line, Andrew Scott will have you hooked in this half-hour monologue by Simon Stephens that captures truths about family life, art, nature and much else besides. Scott performed the play at the Bush in 2008 and it was a hot ticket when he reprised it at the Old Vic 10 years later. This version was shot in a single take in 2011. Directed by Stephens and Andrew Porter, it is available online to buy. Brace yourself. I Wish I Was a Mountain With wonder, wit and sophisticated storytelling, performance poet Toby Thompson creates a beautiful show for over-sevens. Thompson steps in and out of his version of Hermann Hesse’s fairytale Faldum, riffing with the young audience and spinning a handful of jazz LPs. I Wish I Was a Mountain embraces big questions about time and contentment. This is a short but profound show, directed by Lee Lyford, hatched by the Egg theatre’s Incubator development programme and cleverly designed by Anisha Fields. Read the full review. Lyric theatre in Belfast Belfast’s Lyric had to cancel its co-production of 1984 with Bruiser Theatre Company but instead launched the initiative New Speak: Re-imagined, in which Northern Irish talents including Amadan Ensemble, Dominic Montague and Katie Richardson respond to the lockdown crisis.

Alexander Ekman Five works by the Swedish choreographer are on Marquee TV, including a new work for the Royal Swedish Ballet, Eskapist, which got a five-star review from Lyndsey Winship. On a vast stage, “Ekman offers a bombardment of fantastical images, realised with the help of Danish fashion designer Henrik Vibskov, who does a Mad Hatter’s couture party of eccentrically structured silhouettes.” Ekman’s other works to rent include Swan Lake and Midsummer Night’s Dream.

What the Butler Saw Joe Orton’s final farce, completed in the summer of 1967 just before the playwright’s death, is a subversive satire about an irrational world, set in a psychiatrist’s consulting room.

And here’s one unexpected tutor who really commands your attention: Jude Owusu, clad in a dirty bathrobe, with a pen behind his ear and a notepad dangling around his neck. Owusu is Cinna, the poet from Julius Caesar, in this spellbinding film of Tim Crouch’s monologue. Read the full review. Alonzo King Lines Ballet A handful of productions by San Francisco-based choreographer Alonzo King and his marvellous company Lines Ballet are available to rent on Marquee TV. Dust and Light, Triangle of the Squinches and Scheherazade, all filmed in 2012, showcase the elegant nature of his work, which pushes beyond classical ballet. Read the full review. Funny Girl Showtunes don’t get much more defiant or rousing than Don’t Rain on My Parade. Sheridan Smith wards off the clouds with a gritty rendition as Fanny Bryce in this production of the classic musical at Manchester’s Palace theatre in 2017. It’s one of the many productions available to rent from Digital Theatre, whose offerings also include The Crucible starring Richard Armitage at the Old Vic in London, and Maxine Peake’s Hamlet at the Royal Exchange in Manchester. Fragments (Beckett by Brook) Is there a more fitting playwright for our current moment of isolation, uncertainty and endurance than Beckett? In this production, filmed at the marvellously atmospheric Bouffes du Nord in Paris in 2015, Peter Brook directs five Beckett shorts with a cast of three (Jos Houben, Marcello Magni and Kathryn Hunter). The production comprises Rough for Theatre I, Rockaby, Neither, Come and Go and Act Without Words II. Feel the rising panic and despair in Rockaby as the solitary, wide-eyed Hunter recounts a descent through long, lonely days. Palermo Palermo Even by Pina Bausch’s standards it’s an arresting opening: a huge wall collapses on stage and across the rubble comes Julie Shanahan, in high heels and a floral frock. After desperately commanding hugs from two suitors, she takes a seat and is pelted with rotten tomatoes. And so begins an epic patchwork of masochistic rituals, nightmares and games, blending the quotidian with the phenomenal, all inspired by the choreographer’s trip to Sicily. A rare chance to watch one of Bausch’s creations in full and for free online. Oscar Wilde season All four productions in Classic Spring’s starry Oscar Wilde season in the West End can be watched on the online service Marquee TV, which is offering a 14-day free trial. Edward and Freddie Fox play father and son in An Ideal Husband; Eve Best is a memorable Mrs Arbuthnot in A Woman of No Importance; Kathy Burke directs Lady Windermere’s Fan; and Sophie Thompson is horrified by theatre’s most famous handbag in The Importance of Being Earnest. Ghost Quartet If you missed its run at Soho’s Boulevard theatre, here’s a chance to savour Dave Malloy’s song cycle, filmed in New York in 2015. Alternately rousing and yearning, this is a gorgeous hymn to barflies, precious memories and the joys of being a ghost, told with a dash of Edgar Allan Poe and Thelonious Monk. It’s a glorious get-together of a show, as warming as the whiskey handed out to the audience – but you’ll have to pour your own. Le Patin Libre Think dance on ice and you’d imagine sequins and staggering TV celebrities, but the Canadian troupe, Le Patin Libre, has taken the art form into a new dimension. In their double bill, Vertical Influences, the skaters turned the rink into a mesmerising stage slowly decorated by the patterns cut by their blades. Watch the 20-minute short film Vertical on YouTube. The School for Wives Travel restrictions needn’t prevent you from enjoying international theatre online. Paris’s esteemed Odéon has released its 2018 production of Molière’s satirical 1662 comedy of manners and cuckoldry. Claude Duparfait stars as the foolish Arnolphe, and Stéphane Braunschweig directs. English subtitles available, évidemment. Read the full review. 5 Soldiers: The Body Is the Frontline Rosie Kay’s extraordinary 5 Soldiers: The Body Is the Frontline was staged in army drill halls around the UK, but, since its livestream is still available online, you can watch it from the comfort of your own sofa. Performing in close quarters to a score that mixes punk and opera, Kay’s phenomenal company bring home the horror of combat and disarm audiences. The Wind in the Willows Julian Fellowes, George Stiles and Anthony Drewe teamed up to deliver a merry new version of Kenneth Grahame’s classic, staged at the London Palladium in 2017, with Rufus Hound wearing 50 shades of green as Mr Toad. It’s available to rent online, with the option to donate to help provide financial and emotional support to theatre workers. Girls Like That London’s Unicorn theatre has a world-class reputation for theatre for young audiences and its production of Evan Placey’s Girls Like That gripped the roomful of teenagers I watched it with in 2014. It’s online in full and offers a raw account of adolescent anxiety, slut-shaming and self-belief. In-your-face theatre that stays in your mind. John Leguizamo’s Latin History for Morons Self-isolation may mean that many of us will use living rooms to both teach children and watch theatre. An opportunity to combine the two can be found courtesy of the super-charismatic John Leguizamo – an inspirational tutor if ever there was – whose one-man Broadway show, Latin History for Morons, is on Netflix. Woke The subscription service LIVR enables you to catch up on theatre in 360-degree virtual reality. Pop your smartphone into a headset they send you and experience a range of shows including Apphia Campbell’s show Woke, which interweaves the stories of Black Panther Assata Shakur and the 2014 Ferguson riots. The award-winning Patricia Gets Ready, written by Martha Watson Allpress, is also available from LIVR. Timpson: The Musical Two households, both alike in dignity … well, sort of. Our narrator, a talking portrait, lays our scene in Victorian London, and this musical comedy imagines the founding of the popular shoe-repair chain as a union between two companies, the Montashoes and the Keypulets. Watch Gigglemug Theatre’s show on their website. My Left Nut This is cheating as it’s a TV series, but BBC Three’s superb comedy drama is based on one of the most uproarious and affecting fringe theatre shows of recent years. It’s inspired by Michael Patrick’s own teenage experience of a medical condition that left his testicle “so big you could play it like a bongo”. Wince. Rosas Danst Rosas Love dance? Need to exercise at home? Then join the queen of Belgian avant-garde performance Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker as she talks you through how to perform her 1983 classic, Rosas Danst Rosas. All you need is a chair, a bit of legroom and enough space to swing your hair.","charCount":"39560","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"true","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/chriswiegand\">Chris Wiegand</a> Stage editor"},{"headline":"Victoria’s Covid restrictions ‘on track’ to ease from Friday as two cases recorded","standfirst":"<p>Delta strain of Covid-19 identified in Melbourne cases linked to traveller who returned from Sri Lanka and entered hotel quarantine on 8 May</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/jun/08/melbourne-lockdown-covid-victoria-restrictions-coronavirus-rules-covid19-explained-10km-radius-masks-compulsory-exercising-home-gatherings-what-you-need-to-know\">Victoria’s new Covid lockdown restrictions explained</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/jun/08/covid-19-list-melbourne-public-exposure-sites-hotspots-victoria-venues-case-location-alerts-metro-regional-vic-coronavirus-cases-outbreak-locations\">List of Victoria Covid public exposure sites</a>; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/jun/08/covid-19-list-nsw-public-exposure-sites-hotspots-goulburn-jervis-bay-hyams-beach-gundagai-venues-case-location-alerts-sydney-regional-coronavirus-cases-outbreak-locations\">NSW hotspots</a></li></ul>","trailText":"Delta strain of Covid-19 identified in Melbourne cases linked to traveller who returned from Sri Lanka and entered hotel quarantine on 8 May","byline":"Elias Visontay","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4067ca179a86868ca27f850c635c77298b6ee72e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4067ca179a86868ca27f850c635c77298b6ee72e/0_97_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Health workers conduct Covid-19 tests in South Melbourne on Monday.

Health authorities also revealed that genomic sequencing has linked the Delta strain of Covid-19 that spread in West Melbourne to a traveller who returned from Sri Lanka and entered hotel quarantine on 8 May. While he tested positive in hotel quarantine and was moved to a health hotel on 9 May before finishing quarantine on 23 May, authorities are puzzled as to how the man in his 40s transmitted the virus to other cases in the West Melbourne cluster. The man lives in the Glen Eira LGA, in Melbourne’s southeast, and the other 23 passengers on his flight, aircrew, Skybus crew, and hundreds of staff from both hotels linked to the man have tested negative. “I can confirm that so far there is no reported or obvious breach of infection prevention control protocols or anything else that would indicate a transmission has happened inside the hotel,” Danny Pearson, acting police and emergency services minister, said. Allen Cheng, Victoria’s deputy chief health officer, said of four theories authorities are exploring about how Covid spread from the man, the “most likely” was that he transmitted the virus to another hotel guest or to a staff member when being transferred to the Holiday Inn health hotel. Of the two new cases announced on Tuesday, one is a child linked to the West Melbourne Delta variant cluster, and the other is a household contact of a worker linked to the Kappa variant outbreak at the Arcare Maidstone aged care facility. Merlino said both of the new cases have had limited community exposure, as they were primary contacts of known cases. While flagging an easing of restrictions to take effect from Friday, Merlino said public health advice meant that travel between metropolitan Melbourne and regional Victoria would continue to be restricted over the long weekend. “That will extend beyond any announcements that we will make later in the week. There are very good reasons for that. We absolutely want to run this into ground and ensure that there’s no risk of this spreading out into regional Victoria. We wanted to be up-front and honest with people at the earliest opportunity. “I don’t want to foreshadow what we are going to announce. We are still...working through all the elements. It is a day-by-day, hour by hour analysis about how we are tracking … We remain on track to provide that easing of restrictions to all Victorians,” Merlino said. There are now 85 local cases of Covid-19 in Victoria. Asked if the genomic discovery of the Delta variant’s origins constituted a failure of hotel quarantine, Merlino reiterated the shortcomings of hotel design and how his state has been pursuing a purpose-built quarantine facility. “We are making it as risk-free as humanely possible but it has never ever been a zero-risk environment. That is not the nature of hotels. Hotels are built for tourists. They’re not built to tackle infectious disease,” Merlino said. He also said that any purpose-built quarantine facility would act alongside hotel quarantine, and could be used to support higher risk returned travellers. Merlino was also scathing of the Victorian opposition’s demand for premier Daniel Andrews to release details of his back injury, saying the state Liberal party “should be ashamed of themselves”. Elsewhere on Tuesday, Western Australia’s premier Mark McGowan announced residents aged 30 to 49 will be able to receive the Pfizer Covid vaccine from Thursday, while South Australia expanded its vaccine eligibility to those aged 40-49.","charCount":"3688","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/elias-visontay\">Elias Visontay</a>"}]
